DONT BOTHER! The majority of women who work here are very rude.  I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars here in the last 3 years and when trying to us a free 5$ coupon here that wouldnt scan, I was accused of already using the coupon and trying to double use.  Are you kidding me!  If you dont want to offer the savings Babies R Us, then DONT!   Not the first time myself, sister or mother was treated poorly here.  Sad, but true.   This store needs new management to come in and do some housecleaning with the staff.  At this point, I WILL not shop here and will pay more elsewhere just to avoid this place!  You have seen my last dollar Babies R Us.

We dined at El Chorro on a rainy night so we did valet mainly for the umbrella. I was told by the greeter to leave it at the front door and upon returning it was gone. We were seated right next to a leaky roof with a constant patter, very distracting.  As they staff tried to fix the issue right in the middle of dinner service. Service was very slow as servers are busy with big parties that are also saeted in the main dining. I was charged for 2 soft drinks when all I did was switch from the flat 7up to coke, and they brought me diet and we had to flag down the server to get it switched. Apps. were great and the sticky buns good. I ordered the strougnouff and it was full of onions which was not in the menu description.  For 30$, it did not live up to its expectations.  Finally, we were served dessert with dirty dishes still on our table but all we could do was stare at it as utensils were MIA.  Overall, very disappointed!!

AMAZING!! The drinks there are truly hand crafted and the food is delicious!  Don't miss out on the taters tots.  @ only1$ a piece and ala carte, I suggest getting a plate of a least 10, you won't be disappointed.   Nice and clean atmosphere and sometimes chill live music.  Wish I lived closer, I'd be here every night.
