Unimpressed with the customer service at this location. First time at a coffee rush and the barista behind the seems unenthusiastic and sassy.  I feel like she does not understand what it takes to create repeat customers. I will not be returning to this establishment.

Can't help but to adore the staff and the new location! I usually drop in to utilize the awesome Normatec boots after a killer leg work out, but I went for my first deep tissue this time.  I'd like to express how impressed I am with Trisha ' s knowledge     in the field, and how comfortable she made me feel during the massage session. I have officially found a place I can count on and trust for rehabilitation and restoration.

Made it out to spokes yesterday to catch up with friends. Such a cool place. The patio overlooks Spirit of yoga's pond which makes a nice view. Service here is awesome! The bartenders really know their brew and the appetizers are tasty.  The patio is dog friendly and I immediately had regrets for not bringing jasper.  The unique variety of beer on tap is exciting and there is a cool lounging area to watch the game. It's bike themed so all the small art detail is wicked cool.  Thanks for a great after spokes staff!
