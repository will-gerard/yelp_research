We came here around 7:15p tonih we walked in and read the sign that said to seat yourself and we did. The man behind the to go order counter area clearly saw us walk in... we waited,  and waited. For about ten minutes we waited for something... anything,  we got nothing... completely ignored. We left, I wonder if the people who went in as we were leaving got the same treatment?

I love this  place! They do such a fantastic job, especially with backfills! I have been coming here since high school. Francine and Scott do an awesome job, I highly recommend this business to anyone.

Fantastic. Despite the other reviews I still went, with some hesitation. I walked in and was greeted by (I think a granddaughter?) the waitress, and was told I could sit where I wanted. My drink order was taken and a menu was given to me. I chose the Denver Omlette, with wheat toast, and a cinnamon roll  (because I am a fatty and have been on a competition diet for 6 months). Coffee came, and water (which I didn't have to ask for), and shortly there after my food came. Let me just say that I gave this place 5 stars specificially because of their potatoes which were crispy where they needed to be and had a ton of flavor. Their omlette was awesome, nice and fluffy, really big pieces of green pepper, ham, and onions, YUM. Their cinnamon roll, over flowing with icing and butter. Omg, SO good. Let me just say... if you act like a jackass to Grandma, she will treat you like one right back. The staff wasn't rude, as previous reviews suggested. The place was very clean, and did remind me of my Grandma's kitchen except not Polish.

I really wanted to like this joint, I havent enjoyed pasta for a few months and was really looking forward to consuming food here. Let me tell you, for as long as it was to actually receive and consume the food.... it was worth it. The food was phenomenal, that was about it. Unfortunately it was incredibly busy due to the marathon, as well as the auctions. Meal tickets were getting lost, it was mass MASS chaos. Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said "Nope, can't do it we have people outside." Before I could even respond, he took his little elf self and ran away. We also had our son along, this place is not so good for kids.

I never actually got to eat at this place, as they put a flier on my front door. I called to have some food delivered, during their hours of operation... No one ever answered the phone. Guess they must not need the business.

Frickin Awesome!!! This lady is so awesome with kids! Her art is fantastic, and she paints one heck of a Batman and Spiderman.

Probably not the best idea to bring children, however they are accommodating!

The food was really great, we sat at the bar and after we were finished with our sushi we watched one of the sushi chefs pick his nose... Oh yes. Not only did he not wear gloves, not only did he pick his nose... but after he picked his nose he rolled whatever was in his fingers into the palm of his hand and looked at it!!! When he was done picking his nose he stuck his hand in the steamed rice cooker, and went on to prepare more sushi. We had ordered two more rolls before witnessing this, so we asked our waiter for a to go box, the box and its contents were left on the chairs outside.           Upon our arrival to Sushi Creek we sat at the bar for at least 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence. The Nose Picker stood behind the bar drinking his coffee flavored Monsters beverage, and glanced at us a few times. Our waiter finally came around, he was very nice and somewhat attentive. The (Japanese?) woman sushi chef, wore gloves and changed them often, she was also very nice. (It's not so much the not wearing gloves that bothers me about The Nose Picker, you could not wear gloves and wash frequently. Just don't pick your nose and the prepare food!!!). The hostess and at least 4 other waitresses spent the majority of their time talking to a regular customer about some girl being punched in the face and about how the other waitress got dumped a day after her birthday and was pissed about it. The entire time we were there, the really old waitress with the auburn-ish colored hair, with an iphone with a blue cover; did not wait on another customer while we were there... for an hour and a half she just stood in front of this old guy, that was it! Another annoyance that really started to bother us after The Nose Picker incident was that the old guys phone (which was on the bar) kept vibrating. This wouldn't have mattered so much, however the vibration was so powerful that by the end of the short time we were there we so fed up. We were sitting more than 6ft away and could hear the entire conversation with the waitresses, including watching several other staff walk in from the back to 'hang out'. Then we watch the woman sushi chef eat her dinner behind the bar as well as other staff eat their dinner.           The food is good, until we saw the extra ingredients that weren't on the menu being added. Service was poor. We will not be dining here again.

This gym does not even deserve one star. Not only are the gym staff rude, so are managers, and child care staff. The child care staff, with the exception of one person (Diane), are all worthless and should not be working with children. I realize it does not take any brains or skill to work at a corporate gym. After today we will not be returning.

I have never been to a Ranch Market before, so one night we stopped as we were very hungry. Myself, husband, and son waited in line for about 15 minutes. Every person who had been in line at the restaurant counter had their food, paid, and sat down to eat. The three of us stood there and waited for one of 6 employees behind the counter to acknowledge our presence. Not a one of them wanted to make eye contact, finally one of them came to the counter for assistance. Because my four year old is picky, I asked if I could get a chicken and rice meal. The employee looked at me, acted confused and said 'I don't think we have anymore chicken... You can go check at the other counter and see.' Really? I waited in line with my family for you (a customer service employee) to tell me that I needed (me, the customer) to check and see if you have chicken. Give me a break. I looked at her and said 'thanks for your help, appreciate it.'   I know when I am not wanted, and when my money is not wanted. I will not be returning here, ever. I gave a rating of two stars because wanted to like this place, but unfortunately I was treated poorly.

I called Gorilla Auto Glass at 11pm on Sunday after seeing a big crack in my windshield.  By noon on Monday, I had a new windshield installed at NO COST to me.  Beat that!!

Staff is inattentive and unprofessional. If you come in with a child don't expect to be waited on immediately, or have your drinks refilled.

This place from the outside is kind of sketch. But it is great on the inside.  The service was awesome,  the sushi came out a little slower than normal... but it's worth it. I will definitely be back again!

Oh my God this place is terrible. The service is so bad here... So bad. They need more staff and know it. Maybe they want to save money by not hiring anyone else... Our sushi sat in the corner of the bar for a half hour before anyone brought it to us. The other half of our order remained on the bar until I went up and got it myself. Come on people. You can get much better service up the street, food isn't worth it.
