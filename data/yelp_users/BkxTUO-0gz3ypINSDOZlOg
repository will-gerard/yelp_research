I honestly have to say this place is a mess. I enjoyed the comedians but I was so uncomfortable. My seat was very lumpy. The place was very dirty. The ladies room was equally dirty so I held it until I got home. I think it needs some renovations.   I didn't like that our parking voucher said $5 and they made us pay $10. The show was to start at 8:30 it started at 9p and the 15 minute intermission turned into 30 minutes. The show was suppose to be an hour and half but it ended up being 3 hours.  I did like that every seat appears to be a good seat.

I haven't had a bad experience yet. Even when I get to the airport late I seem to get through security fast and on time for my flight. The staff is usually very helpful asking if I need a ride to my gate but I politely decline. I wouldn't want to take that opportunity away from someone who is unable to walk the distance. So far it's one of the better airports in the US.

I stopped here because of reviews from friends but they didn't have any of the natural products I use on my hair. They are good for beauty products, equipment and lashes ladies :-). Customer service was okay.

This store stays packed but if you need help at the genius bar these guys will definitely help you!! They can practically fix anything or will try really hard to. I've been here a few times for accessories but I've never had a major problem with my 5 year old MacBook. Besides getting a new charger-I refuse to part ways with it. A day ago in class my laptop shut off, I thought it crashed but I found out today it needed some software fixes. It's inevitable that I'll have to get a new one but until then-Thanks Tristan and Dylan for my laptop bandaid!   Great customer service skills, very knowledgeable, friendly environment, & everyone is helpful.   4 stars because: 1). In general, excessive prices and 2). As one of the world's most innovative technology manufacturers-I want my 5 year laptop equipped to hold newer software. I don't want to throw away a laptop every 5 years because it's outdated, especially if I love it. Update my outdated Mac. :-)

Cough! Cough! If you want to catch black lungs this is the place!! My girlfriends and I went here Wednesday night for the crab leg buffet. I've been here plenty of times but I never stuck around after eating. We decided to have a few drinks and hang around and was ran out due to the aggressive smokers. It smells like an ancient smoke house. You will definitely catch 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th hand smoke here, so none smokers like myself wear a face mask or avoid it altogether. And if you have asthma don't risk your life! It can be a cool hangout if the ventilation system worked. Almost forgot, the restaurant is like any regular buffet and the crab legs are tasty. This is a gem in Arizona with the lack of affordable seafood. But again, you have to walk/crawl and push through the thick air of dirty lungs before reaching this gem!

I liked that they offered gluten free pizza, but this food made me sick. Could've been the grease, idk. Two bites in and I started to get pain in my stomach.They also advertise as NY style, but it doesn't taste like NY pizza. This place isn't for me.

I'm rating this airline a four because they are one of the only airlines who still provide free snacks. After paying $500+ for a flight the least they can do is feed us, even if it is just peanuts and pretzels. Flights are increasing yet amenities are decreasing.   I like their moto, "every passenger is first class." Even if it isn't true I like their attitude!   Lastly, to Southwest, what makes you a competitor in this market is your occasional sales. Please keep that going and stop the blackout dates. Thank you.

There is one main reason I absolutely adore this place. I am hugely obsessed with Egypt and Egyptian culture. I love the decor and architecture that resembles an actual pyramid. Inside of this pyramid is what is considered the grand view of hotel rooms shaped into what many embassy suite hotels look like inside. Everything from the hieroglyphics, sphinx and tombs collectively creates an atmosphere beyond Vegas. During a stay in the UK I planned to visit Egypt but because of war my flight was refunded. Until I am able to visit Cairo and tour Egypt I'll enjoy this for now. I can go on about this place but unfortunately it doesn't include gambling because I don't partake.

This show was a complete surprise!! I love Cirque Du Soleil but I didn't know much about the beatles. I didn't know what to expect. It was entertaining, creative, artsy, interactive, and the story line was interesting. The special effects were mesmerizing especially the bubbles (only spoiler). The costumes were nice-60s, 70s, colorful, fros, bell bottoms, VW bugs,  etc.   The theater is circular and every seat seemed to be a good seat. If you have floor seats you will have to look up a lot - mid-level is probably the best. I'll recommend it to everyone. The show was LOVE.

Coming here with a few friends after a long week is more than relaxing. I'm not originally from AZ so Friday night crowd here is more like a nice lounge with great food. The drinks are great. The crowd is always laid back just having a good time. The staff is always very helpful. I occasionally have take out here as well and after a while the staff remembers you and have your food ready when you arrive.   Friendly faces, cool atmosphere, mixed crowd, all calls for a great happy hour.

This is precisely why people do not like government workers. I went in to simply mail a package and buy a book of stamps. It was approx 1:01p and one of the employees informed me that they were closed. I asked what time did they close she stated at 1p. So I looked at my cell and it's 1:01pm. She proceeded to say that I can use the machine to purchase and mail my package if I had a card. So, as I'm using this machine I am clearly having problems. She was still standing next to me but having leisure conversation with another customer. I asked for assistance politely and was still there holding up what is now four people in line. Once everything printed out I noticed the trap door she said to put my package in was not opening. So another customer came by to assist me, meanwhile the lady, employee, went in and closed the door. So I knocked on the door to get her attention attention and let her know the trap door for packages was not opening and her and her rude coworkers looked, shook their heads, and proceeded to turn off the lights. As if I couldn't see them.  No one came to assist where they clearly could have. The people here are rude and give a bad name to postal workers everywhere!

If you love seafood you would appreciate this restaurant. It is the closest to Maryland style seafood located in the desert. The crab cakes were very filling and if you order it, one is enough. It was majority lump crab meat (crab cake lovers appreciate that). I was so excited for crab cakes I ordered 2 with blue crab, corn on a cob, and hush puppies. I was stuffed but very satisfied.   The prices are a little higher for blue crab but it's expected being in Las Vegas--no ocean (imported seafood daily).   This restaurant has two locations. I went to the location closer to the strip (10 min. drive), easy to find. I was surprised to see the store front, it looked more like a take out restaurant but we went in anyway and I'll definitely go back for a meal again.

Cute artsy cafe with reasonable prices. They offer a humbling $25 cent discount to students and it's appreciated. The baristas are nice, the owner is pleasant. It's quiet and suitable for outside work because of the free wifi.

I absolutely love Rita's Italian ice. Coming from the east coast the store is open seasonally so during the winter months the store is closed. When they first started opening up here in the Phx area I thought it was brilliant! Love the various flavors specifically cotton candy and Swedish fish with vanilla custard combo in the Gelati. Taste great!

I've been shooting for a little while now but never took any real lessons or learned gun safety. So, tonight I took the pistol 100 Course with Todd and it was more than expected-it was EXCELLENT. Most people are not comfortable around guns but if you have an interest or people around you carry, this is a great course to learn gun safety and get proper training. The class was from 5p to 9p. It starts off in a class room setting, with powerpoints and demonstrations. Afterwards Todd and/or another sales representative will help you pick out a gun that best fits you. There is another class component that teaches the dynamics of various guns, bullets, handling, cleaning, loading, standing, and LOTS of SAFETY! Lastly, you get to put what you just learned with guidance on the range.   Overall the class was fun, and educational. Todd was humorous and kept the class interactive. I would definitely go to C2 tactical for future gun courses.

I LOVE THIS SHOW AND WILL SEE IT AGAIN! If you are a huge MJ fan like myself you will enjoy it. I seen MJ Immortal life as well and will continue to watch them if it continues to be reinvented. It was a none stop performance full of life and memories. You will get emotional - matter of fact- tears started to form and I tried to fight it. Lol. It was magical! I think MJ would have loved it as well. Thank you Cirque Du Soleil for another wonderful MJ experience.

I was excited to find this place here in Arizona. It's a small comfortable family restaurant in Mesa and embodies the soulful, cultural, and harmonious seasons of Louisiana. The food was good and I can't wait to try other options the restaurant offers. I ordered the Craw Fish Etouffe w/white rice, fried catfish and green olive Cole slaw. I wasn't fond of the Cole slaw definitely not within my taste buds but everything else was delicious. We also had hush puppies!! Loved them.   My friend ordered the jambalaya and seafood gumbo which I was told was great but gumbo was VERY spicy.   I ordered take out so I didn't experience any memorable customer service.
