Was really disappointed in this specific Safeway.  Went there to do a return and grocery shop for my brother.  Waited at Customer Service for a return for over 20 minutes, and there was only 1 person in front of me. They took forever, and finally at the very end the lady there asked what i needed and called someone up.   The Assistant Manager, Michelle came to "help". She was completely RUDE, and gave me bad looks the entire one minute i talked to her. And she couldn't even help me with my return.  After grocery shopping, there was only 1 line open. with 5 people in front of me and one behind. Took so long to get through.  Very annoyed. And would not recommend shopping there.

Huge portions, and great prices. Family owned. Really delicious food. My favorite is the Jalapeno Fried Chicken, and I love the fried rice! They have delivery too!
