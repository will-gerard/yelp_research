I went by this location for lunch today, only to see a big CLOSED sign by the entrance.  Other cars came in too so I'm assuming it recently shut down.  I had lunch there 2 weeks ago.  The sign said that the Gilbert location was still open.

My favorite wings in the East Valley so far.

Update 2/18/2013...  Still a BIG fan of their brownies.  Either I missed the pre-packaged ones the past couple of times I stopped there or they just don't package 4 of them anymore.  Irregardless, they are still really good.  My favorite is still the chocolate brownie.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This was a place I've always passed driving up north from the desert floor of Phoenix to the mountains of Flagstaff.  It wasn't until someone had recommended it that I stopped by on my way home one recent trip.  Not only because of the recommendation but from the throngs of people waiting to get in could I tell that this was a popular stop.    There were plenty of pies to choose from.  All of them looked delicious.  On my first trip I happened to pick up some of the Turtle Brownies.  Not only were there four huge squares of them, they were moist, chewy, and very delicious.  This will be one place that I now make sure to stop by on my way back home from the mountains.  The difficult part will be choosing which pie or pastry to get the next time.

Nondescript place serving great bean & cheese burritos and tacos.

A good breakfast joint with a great view.  Not only can you chow down on some good omelets and other breakfast entrees but you get to see airplanes taxiing, taking off, and landing at the same time.  You know a place is good when a seat is hard to come by on a Saturday morning and there is no way to tell this place is there from the street.  This place is deserving of repeat business from me.

What's not to like about this place?  This is always a favorite of our family to go to when celebrating a special occasion.  We haven't had a bad meal, or drink, here yet.  First off, you have to try their house margarita.  There are unique (a splash of beer is added at the end when they make it), potent, and very good.  The Big Beefstro Salad is a great start to a meal.  Tender slices of warm beef mixed in with greens, diced jalapenos, cheese, caramelized onions, and dressing makes this a great salad with a little heat.  To my surprise, the wings were really good.  All of the wings were drummies.  They were deep fried and very meaty.  All of them had a nice crisp to them.  I got the Italian Gold ones.  It is a honey mustard, BBQ sauce.  Besides BBQ, this my second favorite wing sauce now.    The Chicago-style pizza is also a must have.  Make sure you order it in the beginning because it takes time for it to cook.  But the time to cook it is all worthwhile in the end.  It's the best Chicago deep-dish style pizza I have had in the Phoenix area.  Lastly, you can't go wrong with the pizza cookie for dessert.  The cookie dough is gooey and warm.  The cold of the ice cream compliments it perfectly.  A must have.  Combine all of these with pleasant servers in a great setting and you have a great place to unwind after a long week or to celebrate something special.

Probably one of the better cheesesteaks I have had recently in the Valley.  I have not deviated from the original combo (original cheesesteak, fries, and a drink) from the 3 times that I have gone.  That means I enjoyed it.  They sell Wise chips also.  Friendly staff.

Good wings.  A person who worked there recommended the Gold Fever sauce.  I must say I was not disappointed.  It was spicy, yet tasty...  two things I like when I eat wings.  Too bad I don't live closer or else this would be a good place to go when I have a wing fix.

Never had a bad meal here.  Always a great place to eat.  I wish they would bring back the jalape√±o, sausage gravy.  That was delicious.

I have driven by this place many times and never once thought about stopping in.  That was until the other day someone at work had recommended this place.  Thank goodness for that recommendation.  The Sonoran dog is a must have.  Good ole Mexican street-style comfort food.  I had 2 but could of just as easily had 1.  This dog was piled high with pinto beans, bacon, pico de gallo, ketchup, mayo, mustard and all contained within a soft bun.  I'd be surprised if someone could eat one of these and not spill something.  I also had some chips and different salsas from the salsa bar.  Good chips and tasty salsas.  My only complaint was that the chips were a little too salty for me.  But I'm one who does not care for a lot of salt.  I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it.  The street-style tacos looked great and also had heard their tortas are wonderful too.  I'll save that for my next trip.

Excellent pasties.  Both the Bangers & Mash and Red Curry Chicken Tikka Masala pasties were very tasty.  Great ambiance.

3 strikes and you are out.  I've now given this place 3 tries.  Not going back again.  The service was not good and the food was only mediocre at best.

Don't think that all of the Filiberto's are the same.  Of the Filiberto's I have been too, this one makes the best breakfast burritos.

I recently had their breakfast burrito and was it really good.  Egg, ham, cheese, pico de gallo.  The thing was a monster.  It was filling enough for me to still be full at lunch time.  Combine the breakfast burrito with their red sauce and you have one heck of a meal.  Definitely worth going back again.

One of the better breakfast burritos I have had.  It fills me up through lunch.  The ham, egg, and pico de gallo make this a must have every time I stop by.  And as the other reviewer mentioned, a salsa bar to boot.

Always have to get the Pollo Fundido.  Can't go wrong with that.  It's even better on Wednesday's.  $5.

This place was a disappointment.    I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since I've moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillo's in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to.  The Italian Beef sandwich at Al's just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me.  To top it off, the service wasn't the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a "chopped" salad.  The lettuce wasn't even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  It's the little things.  We ended up leaving disappointed.  It was a bust for us and definitely not worth the trek from Chandler.

Well I must say there was plenty of food to choose from...  fruits, salad, sushi, desserts, seafood, Chinese, and some American.  There was nothing really that made this buffet stand out from the rest.  It was mediocre at best for me.  Thankfully I didn't go at dinner time when it gets a bit pricey for a family of 4.  If you want to go, I would suggest going at lunch time when the price is more reasonable.

Great burger and even better seasoned fries and special dipping sauce for the fries.  The frozen custard is good and a must have if stopping in.  Personally I like the "other" chain's frozen custard better.

Great local, authentic Italian food.  We had the calzone, penne a la vodka, margharita pizza, and the gnocchi.  Each dish was fresh, hot, and delicious.  If it wasn't for the gift certificate we got, we might have never eaten there.  We'll go back when we are in the mood for authentic Italian.  We hope this place sticks around for a while.

I don't know about the other reviewers, but the service I had was less than stellar, time to get our drinks and food were long, the menu had too many items on it, the food was less than spectacular, and the decor had not changed at all since it was Red, White, and Brew.  I'm surprised there were as many people that there were there.  Maybe it's just because they opened and are still ironing out the wrinkles, but it will be sometime before I visit again.

Wonderful workout.  Always different.  Staff is great, helpful, and caters to your specific needs.  Not only is the workout all encompassing, but the encouragement during makes me want to come back again.  Going to a gym would not have given me that encouragement.  None of the workout is intimidating, only encouraging.
