Years back I would always be here but went back and whoooa what a change and not in a good way :/Would give 0 stars but I can't. Horrible place to go.  Only go if you want your night to be ruined.  Rude people working there. They don't have manners they talk back to you. Very poor customer service was only their for 5 minutes. Guy working their was acting like he owned Westgate and said to go back to Phx. HAAAAA I live out west so kinda sad that they have people like this running this place.

This place was good ...i felt like I was at my friend Alans house!!! lets just say I felt like I was in Mexico with the music playing..the food was fresh very tasty. Chips in salsa was on point like a box cutter. People were friendly ..overall place was clean and I will be coming here more often ..no more Filismoothies for this litto stomach.
