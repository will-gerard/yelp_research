Appalling conditions. They put people in wards in the basement where there is no sunlight. The rooms are run down and dirty. The showers and bathrooms are completely disgusting. I would have rather relieved myself outdoors. But you have to earn the privilege of even going outside. The mirrors are warped so you can't clearly see the deterioration of your condition from having stayed there. Once you are behind the doors of the ward, the only way you will leave is if the doctor in there gives you the okay to be released, meaning they could hold you for as long as they wanted, even though the paperwork they have you sign gives you the impression you can leave at your own choosing.  The therapy there is remedial and was of little to no value there. Most of it is group therapy where you talk about feelings and is not geared toward a specific individual's needs. You see the psychiatrist for 10 minutes a day, if that. His job is only to prescribe you medication in a wait and see what works and what doesn't work fashion.  The beds are made of a very hard plastic and it is almost impossible to get any sleep in here which is not conducive to a healthy state of mind.   They run the place more like a business rather than a care facility. Providing the lowest possible care at the highest possible price. I saw what they charged my insurance for a 2 night/3 day stay and it was criminal. Upon entry they try to extract money from you but don't allow you to see the conditions where you will be staying in first. The intake and exit process has a lot of inexperienced people running it.  Other patients had told me they had been there for weeks, months on all sorts high dosages of painkillers and antipsychotics. Places like these are in a position to take advantage of patients for their own profit. This place is a business first and a health care provider last! One man was undergoing electric shock therapy and he would laugh randomly and tell random jokes throughout the day as if each one were an electric shock to his brain. It was painful to see.  The food is also disgusting. The only thing that didn't taste gross was the fruit and the drinks. It's basically powered eggs everyday and then some nasty slop at night. Even the oatmeal is gross.  When I was released I looked like a totally different person. Like a beggar. I ran out of there as quick as possible. They tried to get me to fill out a survey but words cannot describe or a survey cannot say what a horrible experience I had in this place.

Last Friday we tempted fate and headed over to Honey Bear's BBQ restaurant in Phoenix. We equipped ourselves with full kevlar body suits complete with knee cap armor.  During lunch hours it can be hard to find a parking slot at Honey Bear's Bar-B-Q restaurant. There are probably 20 spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly. From the outside, Honey Bear's looks as if it has had it's share of violence and has survived through it all. Fortunately enough, the inside makes up for the outside, but only in part. The restaurant is clean and the food appears to be prepared in a clean environment. But the whole building and the front part sure could do with a fresh coat of paint. That whole part of Phoenix is pretty runned down anyways. Honey Bear's is probably the best kept of its neighbors. Even so, don't attempt to gamble with your life and walk from work to the restaurant, you might get stabbed or shot at or both -- you've been warned.  Many people in our office love Honey Bear's and if they had the chance would go and eat there every day. Out of the three times I've been to Honey Bear's during two of them I've gotten a BBQ sandwich and the other time I got a salad. The salad was nothing to write home about and honestly I didn't expect it to be. The place specializes in Tennessee style BBQ and not in salads. So if BBQ doesn't turn you on, then neither will Honey Bear's. The BBQ sandwiches at Honey Bear's never seem to impress me though. It just reminds me of sloppy joe and honestly I'd rather have a sandwich made with Manwich than with their BBQ chicken. Manwich is at the very least "managable". The meat on the sandwichs at Honey Bear's seem to be all over the place. It is uncontrollable almost. Their is no picking your sandwich up and eating it. If you try, it is just a mess. You end up having to eat your sandwich with a fork. Com'on now, is that how the people in Tennesee eat their sandwiches? With a fork? Yea, it's true what their moto says, "You don't need no teeth to eat our meat!", but I can guarantee you, you'll need a fork.  As for food presentation, Honey Bear's doesn't do so well. Their sandwiches come wrapped in tin foil and the first impression you get is that there was no care put into it when they made it. They just plopted the meat on and moved on to the next customer.  I have heard through various channels that Honey Bears tastes like cafateria food. Atleast I'm not the only hater.  The price for food at Honey Bear's is about $5 just for the sandwich alone. With a drink and a side order of something it will usually run you about $8. The whole menu is pretty much a-la-carte.  We will probably visit Honey Bear's agian because my co-workers have a thing for BBQ. But honestly, I think that Honey Bear's reputation is far better than their food and food presentation.

We ordered catering for Christmas day.  This is the first time that we catered food for a holiday and after hearing some other family members have success doing it, we decided to try it and picked AJ's Fine Foods.   It was about $130 for a turkey breast meal. Since they are not opened on Christmas day, we went and picked it up on Christmas Eve. It came with reheating instructions. When we tried to heat it up, the heating instructions were no bueno. The containers the food came in were meant for heating in the microwave and not the stove and the instructions should have included something to that affect.   The stuffing, gravy, and yams were pretty good. The meal had three huge turkey breasts that didn't seem cooked very well. We never ate the pumpkin pie that came with it so I couldn't tell you how that was. It was a lot of food for 4 people and most of it just seemed sub par. The rolls were store brand and so was the pie. It looked like they just took them off the shelves and included it in the catering.   All in all the I've had better catered food for Thanksgiving at Chicken Express when I visited my cousin in Texas. AJ's Fine Foods did not deliver the quality that I was expecting. We could have made something better ourselves. I will say however that AJ's does have a large assortment of beer.

I wish they had a location closer to me! I've always done the take out but now I guess they deliver too! The pizza is crisp and has the perfect amount of cheese. I like that they have updated their website. They have a 10" pizza which is great for a night in alone. Prices are spot on. Staff friendly.

We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.  Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice.   The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.  Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!  I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris.

We like Rubios every time my cousin comes into town. But this location always smells like raw sewage inside. It is disgusting. Nobody wants to eat at a place that smells like that. It is an on again off again situation. You never know if the smell is going to be there or not when you walk in.

We wanted to try some Japanese food. A nameless coworker of mine suggested Ichi Ban, located on Alma School and Baseline Rd. Apparently he told us that he had drove by it and thought it would be worth a try. He must have drove by it drunk. The appearance of the building is simply a monstrosity in and of itself. The architects must have been on acid when they designed it because it is such an eye sore. I keep hearing in my head, "..don't judge a book by its cover", yet my judgments usally end up being correct.   When we walked into the establishment that is Ichi Ban there was nobody in there. I mean it was totally dead. At that moment I felt that if we continued to sit down and eat we might just die. Ichi Ban had Kitchen Nightmare written all over it. I mean, if when you walk into a restaurant and nobody is there take that as a sign from God not to eat. So we sat down and ordered some food.   Everybody got soup. I guess it came with your meal. I didn't try the soup myself, but I looked around and watched as others did. And the reaction on their faces told me that it probably tasted of dishwater. A while after we got our soup our main courses arrived. I had the Teriyaki Chicken. Let me say that the rice was mushy and the chicken was cold. I could hardly eat any of it. The chicken was served on top of a nasty piece of lettuce that just made me want to barf. Forgive me if I am being a little sensational here, I am trying to make up for the lack of sensation I had when eating the food. Two of my other coworkers had some noodle dish of which they complained that there wasn't enough chicken in it.   As we were eating what we could I saw the cook at the sushi bar premaking some food. There was nobody in the restaurant and I wondered who he was making all of it for. Clearly the food isn't prepared fresh and I could taste it in my own dish. I thought to myself, "..how long ago was this chicken cooked, because it is cold now." I must say that Ichi Ban had one thing going for it, great tasting Coke.   After we finished, we got the bill and it ended up costing me $12! I normally don't complain about prices. I'm not poor. But for what we got, it just wasn't worth it. I was pissed. Perhaps I had been a bad boy and maybe that is why I got such horrible food. As we left we all decided not to come back, thank God. I wonder how long Ichi Ban will last before it goes under. It looked and tasted pretty grim.

The shredded beef tacos were not that good. The beef itself was like one long piece of beef. It was like the yarn ball of shredded beef inside my taco. Usually you expect the shredded beef to be, well.. shredded. I'm sorry but if you can't get tacos right then you don't deserve to call yourself Mexican period.  The menu was orange and you couldn't see the pictures of the food on it cause the color of the food was orange too.   The prices were reasonable. The other comment about the place looking like a clown went wicked on this place are justified.

We've been going to Cervantes Restaurant for years now. Me and my co-workers head here for lunch whenever we are wanting some Mexican food. The restaurant is located in a run down plaza which can turn some people off. In fact, I was prejudiced against it when I first visited it because of that, but we've been back many times.  All I've ever gotten is the ground beef tacos. They are some of the best. It is hard to find a place that does ground beef in their tacos. Most of the time restaurants do shredded beef which I hate.  The burritos that everybody else gets look good but I haven't ever tried one. Cervantes isn't one of those Mexican restaurants that flood the plates in beans or cheese. You can tell that they care how the food is prepared.  The service is good. The owner guy and his wife are amiable. You pay up at the front before you sit down and eat which makes check splitting for large groups easy. They bring you chips and salsa. Not a big fan of the chips, but they are free.   If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant in Tempe you should try Cervantes. Some people like it and some people don't. But I like it, it is good for lunch.

After having been back multiple times the food isn't as good as it was initially; the rice doesn't seem fresh, the chips aren't good, the ground beef taco is alright but it is also simple. Other people in our party got other things which they didn't like. There are a lot of problems when ordering with a huge party and orders get mixed up. Service is slow and not everybody gets their food at the same time which leaves half our party eating and the other just waiting.

I've lived in Arizona for 18 years so that makes me more than qualified to judge a Mexican restaurant when I eat at one. Today for lunch co-workers and I decided to eat at Susie's Mexican Cafe. We had previously visited this place before about 2 years ago and found that hardly anything has changed.   Don't let appearances deceive you. The big red door is the only cool thing about the look and feel of this establishment. We were surprised when we entered and there was a line, but the line was full of people trying to pay. So we had to wait a while to be seated. When we sat down, I saw that the booth we were sitting in was held together by duct tape. Not a promising sign. Overall, the place was dirty. It needed a good power washing from top to bottom and I did not feel comfortable sitting there. However, after living here for such a long time I believe this is just par for the course for Mexican restaurants. Sad.   Everybody who went said the food was good but not great. Surprising given that their motto is "A Great Mexican Food Place". They should replace the menus and update them as they have been in circulation for over two years. I had three shredded beef tacos. I think I would have rather had Jack-In-The-Box monster tacos instead. The taquitos looked rather good. I'm sure some menu items are better than others, but haven't verified. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked like standard Mexican food that you'd get at Macayo's or some other Mexican joint.  The lunch specials were $6.75 with our choice of 1 cent draft beer or fountain soft drink. Since I didn't drink any alcohol for lunch you can trust my review isn't tainted. The menu explicitly stated there are no free refills on drinks. Also your first basket of chips was free, but after that they were $2.15 each.  They won't do substitutions on their lunch menu and  they won't split the check. However when you go to pay, you can pay separately. Same difference.   To sum it up it was a sub par experience at least for me. I wasn't impressed, but rather underwhelmed. If you want better Mexican food, I would try Pedro's Mexican Restaurant, Blanco Scottsdale, Cervantes Restaurant, or Carolina's Mexican Food.

I have been to Casey Moores Oyster and Seafood Restaurant in Tempe, Arizona a bunch of times and will continue to go back. We even had a holiday party there one year for work.   "The House" has seating indoors and outdoors with a bar in either place. Due to the laws in Tempe that prohibit people from smoking publicly indoors, outdoor seating is really popular. If you want to come home smelling like smoke, then you'll love sitting outdoors. Everybody in the nation will light up right next to you. :-)  At first I hated Casey Moores, but I have grown to love it. The atmosphere at Caseys is laid back and very chill.. after you've had a few drinks in you. Don't let the general dirtiness of the outside seating area deter you from getting completely tanked. After a while you won't even notice the smoke around you.  I would recommend the fried zucchini and the hummas. Both of which are good combinations when mixed with your choice of booze. When school is in session this place gets rather packed depending on what time you go. But when it does get packed there are some really hot chicks that can be found at this establishment.

I've been to FEZ twice now with family members over a period of 1 year. The food each time has been pretty good, however the service is always lacking. Be warned, if you are homophobic then this place probably isn't for you.  When you walk into the restaurant the decoration is very metro. They have seating both inside and on the patio outside for when it is not too hot.   The sweet potato fries are some of the best. District on 3rd St has sweet potato fries as well, but they just don't compare to FEZ. This time I went I ordered a Barcelona Butterleaf Salad because I wasn't that hungry. Most places you go, the salads are bland, but at FEZ most of the salads on the menu are exciting and each have their own unique taste. We also ordered the Chicken Phyllo Packets which tasted better than they looked. Last time I went I got the Italo Kisra which was decent, although probably had too much pesto on it. Salads cost between $6.95 for a half and $9.95 for a full. Burgers and sandwiches are around $10-12. Entrees such as fish or steak expect to spend $15-$20.   As far as the service goes, it is iffy. Our waitress was nice, that is, when she was around. She was so busy running around that we were neglected on more than one occasion.   I would recommend FEZ to anybody looking to eat on central. There are certainly better places to go as far as the food is concerned, but this place is definitely a good lunch spot any day.

The food here is some of the best middle eastern / turkish food in the valley. I would go here more often if the prices weren't so high. $16 for a lunch is more than I care to spend everyday.

Hands down the best sandwich shop! I've been to almost every sandwich shop in Tempe and none of them come close to delivering what Jersey Mike's does.  The quality of the ingredients and the extra care they put into each sandwich is what sets it apart. The lettuce is thinly sliced and never contains lettuce cores. The tomatoes are always red and rarely do I see a green one. The meat is freshly sliced. The bread is never hard or broken, it is baked perfectly. They also have hot subs and I am not talking about microwaved subs. The sub sizes are spot on. I've been to places where their smallest sub could easily feed a whole family. When they apply the condiments they don't over do it, except for maybe oil and vinegar. You can get a mini sub, chips, and a drink for about $7-$8 so it is definitely is lunch doable.  Everybody there is friendly and asks how my day is going. I used to work at Subway years ago and make sandwiches and know a good sandwich artist when I see one and all these people do an excellent job.  I don't know what is wrong with people and what would make them say Subway is better. Subway is like the McDonalds of sub shops. They don't care if you get broken bread, or if your sandwich is caked with mayo, or if the sandwich is so full of condiments that it can't be closed let alone fit in your mouth. Also Subway smells and don't be surprised if you smell like it after you leave.  When this place first opened they gave out free cookies a few times. I don't know if they still do, but it is always nice to see a place that appreciates it's customers. If you go during lunch there is usually a line, but it moves pretty fast. Also if indoor seating gets full, there are seats out back.

I heart Chipotle. I HATE this location!! There is always this little black kid chilling outside trying to sell stuff. Does this kid even have a business license? If I were the owners of this Chipotle I would shut this kid down asap! He is literally there all the time. It doesn't matter what time of the day I go or which day I go he is always there with his plastic container. He tries to look all sad so people feel sorry for him and buy whatever he is selling. When I get up in the morning and get out the door I feel pleasant, but this kid just ticks me off every time I see him. I don't want to be harassed by some sad puppy dog looking kid every time I want to pick up Chipotle. For the love of God people!  What is truly sad is I go to Chipotle at least once a week and this location is closer to my house than the one on Camelback, but I rather go to the one on Camelback! This location needs to grow some balls and get rid of loiters trying to bother loyal customers.

I've been to a bunch of Thai places in Tempe because my co-workers heart Thai food. Thai Elephant is hands down the best Thai food I've tried. We usually go to Thai Elephant for lunch and it is always packed and usually a little bit of a wait if you get there late, but the best thing to do is to get there early. I've been to Thai Elephant at least 5 times and this is my first review of it.   I was always hesitant of Thai food until I found this place. I thought all Thai places were dark and dingy with Buddhas everywhere. And that they served Monkey brains like in Indiana Jones. LOL.   I've had the cashew chicken, red curry chicken, and the drunken noodles. All of them are great dishes. The red curry has a rich curry flavor that I think is rare to find. The cashew chicken is a safe bet for anybody that is just getting into Thai food. The drunken noodles are good choice even when you are sober. The food is always prepared consistently. The food presentation gets high marks.   With regard to the spiciness of the food, the medium-hot range fits me, but my co-workers are always looking for the hottest and most spicy Thai food. And I think they have yet to find a place that can deliver a truly nuclear heat. I want to see them cry.  The service has on most occasions been well-timed. Sometimes during lunch they get real busy and service can slow down. If you wait to long for your check or are in a hurry just go up to the front and ask for your check and pay. There is always somebody coming around to fill up your drinks. And the waiters and staff there are very friendly.

The Thai food here used to be really good. What happened? I had the red curry chicken and it used to be fantastic but not anymore. So many vegetables, how can you even mix the rice in. It was bland and wasn't even spicy at all. Others who got the drunken noodles, they were bland, not really fried. Everything has gone downhill in the last two years after the cook left.

I have been to Yoshinoya in Japan. When I first went to Japan I refused to even try it, because it looked so nasty. But one drunken night, I gave it a try and found it to my liking.   I just sampled the goods at the only location in Arizona. I must say that the location of this establish is sad. It is situated so far from the city that it is practically where the ghettoland means the farmland.   I did see the Japanese lady that lingered around the restaurant. Most likely she is the one that owns it. What she needs to do is get to work and stop staring at all her patrons. If I were her I would start by firing all those lazy FAT mexicans who work there. They made me feel as if I had just entered a KFC!  However such measures might not be sufficient enough because the location is hurting the business. I myself had to drive 20 minutes to get there, another reviewer said it took him 45 minutes. Not to mention it is situated in an odd location in the plaza. I am of the opinion that they should move to Tempe. The place was odd. So empty.  As for the food, it was decent. However, not as good as the beef bowls I had experienced at Yoshinoyas in Japan. This is probably due to the Americanization of the menu items. I ordered the medium sized beef bowl, but wish I had gotten a large, because the best part of the bowl is the meat. I was surprised to find no chop sticks, seeing how that is how it is eaten in Japan. I also missed the tea.  Pertaining to the other reviewer's comments about the beef being thinly sliced and fatty -- that is the way they do it in Japan. It is way better that way than any fucking terrakyi beef bowl hands down.

When I come to a hotel I expect it to be equal to or greater than what I have at home. Let me tell you, Aria delivered on that front!  I arrived during EDC weekend when the reservation system went down and everything had to be done manually. I ended up waiting in line almost 2 hours before I got to my hotel room. When I went to checkout again, the TV checkout system failed to work, requiring me to wait in line for 30 minutes to checkout. I heard that long check-in check-out times are common place in Las Vegas, I don't know.   I was very pleased with the corner suite I got at Aria. I felt like a king every time I walked into it and I never wanted to leave. The room was so big and so much larger than I had expected. I loved how Control4 was integrated throughout the entire room. I was impressed with both how well they had it working and with how well their custom integration worked with their hotel services. Every light switch was labeled and you could control the curtains with the touch of a button. When you left the room all you had to do was press a button that said "Service" to indicate that the room was ready to be clean. Very cool. I liked how all the TVs were wall mounted. Everything was just very clean looking, modern, and up to date. Even the toliet seat was heated. Now that is attention to detail!   Whenever they would clean my room they did it perfectly. They cleaned things that I would expect to normally be skipped. They paid extra attention to every detail. They even put chocolates on the night stand near my bed every time. One day they put out the slippers for me to wear. Every time I came back and the room was cleaned, it looked like the very first day that I came to the hotel. They even folded my clothes that I had lying on the bed. They put my toothbrush and my other bathroom nessecities on these square paper towels to keep them off the counter. I was amazed. I had to take a double-take every time I came back to my room to make sure that it was actually mine.   I ordered room service 3 nights. Each night it took about an hour from the time I ordered it to the time I received it in my room. Room service was pretty accurate for the most part when they gave time estimates. I had the Seared Halibut twice which I liked a lot and I recommend. I also tried the pizza which was decent enough.  Aria has a really nice spa. It felt very heavenly. I could stay there for hours. They have a salt room which was interesting. I don't know if I could tell if it was working or not. The infinity pool was cool. I liked how it overlooked the Liquid Lounge and you could hear the music and watch the people mingle below as you sit and relax high above. They have 4 hot tubs all of different temperatures. I especially liked the Eucalyptus sauna. It was better than the sauna at Caesars. Also I liked how there were less naked dudes walking around at the Aria spa as compared to Caesars. But Caesars did have an Artic room and a mineral water bath. I had a massage at the spa. You could tell it was higher quality that what you would get from a chain massage establishment. I could definitely tell the oils that they used were higher quality.  One afternoon, I stayed at the pool. It was very enjoyable. I'd recommend everybody check out the pool. I didn't do any gambling at Aria so I can't comment on that. Aria is a little bit of a walk from the rest of the strip. I would say it takes about 10 minutes from your hotel room to the bridge on the strip if you walk normal pace. Probably get that down to 7 minutes if you walk more briskly.  All in all, I would come to Las Vegas again just to stay at Aria. I enjoyed my time. Thank you Aria.

I went to Sun Devil Auto a couple of months ago with my previous vehicle. I had an idea that it was a problem with the spark plugs.  When I got a call back from them they said it was spark plugs but that I also needed the timing belt replaced due to milage and that it would cost $900. I asked what it would cost to get it fixed without the timing belt and he still said $900. Obviously the guy was pushing for an expensive timing belt replacement when all i needed was new spark plugs. I've dealt with lots of auto service centers in my time but this one was the shadiest by far. I wouldn't consider this is miscommunication or misunderstanding, the guy was clearly trying to get me to okay an expensive auto repair that didn't need to be done.   I ended up not getting any repairs done by this shop and had to pay $75 because they looked at it.   As for the 5 star review, of course it is going to be 5 star, her service was done for free and she wasn't pressured into getting work done on her car that she didn't need.

It sucks to have jury duty but the jury center at the Phoenix Municipal Court was really nice and helped turn around what I thought was going to be an even crappier day. The staff were really nice and helpful. The place is built almost like a movie theater. There are about 250 seats all facing a bunch of flat panel LCDs. The facility was clean and felt brand new.  On one of the flat panel TVs they display the status of the cases. So you know how many cases they have left that may need jurors. As soon as that number hits zero they say it is time to go home. It was VERY helpful to have some kind of a status indication because it lets me know something is happening. They played 3-4 movies on the other TVs. And the movies were all fairly recent. I thought the movies were going to be old ones or boring, but these were all good and a couple I hadn't seen before.   I would recommend bringing a laptop or smart phone to help keep you connected to your world while you are waiting on someone else's. They have 4 computers there that you can use.   It would be nice if they have more outlets in the general seating area. Along the wall they have seats that have plugs near them, but most of the time they are full. It would be nice if they had a hand out that provided a list of nearby restaurants. All they had was a binder and it is kinda hard to go through it when somebody else is.  On your jury summons they have a map of where to park. Be sure to bring in your parking stub to have it validated.

So far I have been to Brooklyn Barbershop a number of times. It is the best barbershop I have found. I like how they take their time when cutting my hair and I never feel like they are rushing it even when there are other customers waiting. Every customer is afforded the same attention and I appreciate that. What keeps me coming back is the consistency, even across all barbers. I recommend George. He always cuts my hair perfect!

Visited Zinburger for the first time on New Years eve and was happy to find that it was open. I have lived in the area for about 3 years now and have been wanting to try it out for a while.   The inside of Zinburger is modern and clean lined. You can feel that they care about beef. I mean they have huge cows on the wall, they must care about it! The only thing that was missing in that picture was a couple of UFOs.   They had a hamburger on the menu called the Zinburger. I had to try it since the name of the place was Zinburger, so it must be their signature hamburger. It was 1/2 pound of hamburger with grilled onions on top. I was kind of skeptical of the grilled onion combination because I've grown up with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard hamburgers. I rarely eat hamburgers anymore because let's be honest, there is a lot of shitty burgers out there and it is hard to find a good one. There really is a science to cooking the meat right and I think a lot of grillmasters foul it up. The burger I got was cooked perfectly and I was also pleased with the bun they used on the burger. This wasn't just some soggy bun you'd buy off the grocery store shelf. It was so much better than that! It was hands down the best hamburger bun I've ever tasted. I bet they make the bread in house which just shows the extent they go to make a quality burger.   We also had the sweet potato fries. This is the third place I've been to in Phoenix that has had em. The dip that the sweet potato fries come with really make them taste good.   I went to Zinburger and I wanted a REAL burger and I was not disappointed. Next time I go I want to try their shakes which I have since heard are really good.

My co-workers wanted to try this place so bad that I ended up going here for my second time. We went there for lunch and it was rather empty and that is what it felt like. When you walk in, to the left there is a restaurant and to your right there is a bar. Both have completely different conflicting styles. The place should just decide what it is going to be, either a huge sushi dinning hall or a modern bar. There were large flat panel TVs all over the place, so maybe the owners are just in it to cash in on the sporting events.   The sushi was not impressive. It was not fresh but as another comment said, it was in fact chewy. The edamame was over cooked and had a weird smell to it as if the pot it was cooked in had not been washed. The California rolls tasted like they were made from fake crab. The miso soup had a weird flavor too. It is sad to see such corners cut which could have otherwise made this place better.  We were told by a fellow co-worker that it was cheap, however when we got there I found that not to be the case. The prices are a bit higher than RA Sushi. Check splitting is really easy, they do it for you automatically. Our waitress was lighting quick.   When you open up a sushi restaurant on Mill Ave right next to RA Sushi expect to be compared to it. Hands down I would rather go to RA Sushi or Kabuki (near Tempe Marketplace) than to Kanpai Sushi & Bar. Given Mill Avenue's track record for shops/restaurants that go out of business, I don't give this place very long.  Note: We did not drink alcohol. You should take that into consideration when reading other reviews.

The positive: The waitress was pretty and tried to remain upbeat and eccentric despite the establishment she was working at.  The negative: The food was the worst that I have ever eaten in my entire life. Here are a list of red flags that set it off for me.  1. There were too many genres of food on the menu. Pasta, pizza, steak, mexican, burgers... It screams the fact that they specialize in no particular type of food and that they excel at poorly cooking everything. Very few places are able to maintain high quality food while serving so many types of dishes.  2. The booths were stylized with red glitter. As for the outward appearance, it looked like a dungeon and there was caution tape outside which was worrisome.  3. We ordered an single pizza slice to try out and it was so huge that it was easily split between four people. It was cold and it had a large amount of grease on the bottom of it.  4. Both the thickness of the pizza bread and the cheese on top of it  was too much. The grease on the bottom prevented most of us from finishing it. At least 1-1.5 inches high and it was not deep dish. 5. The preparation of the salads were inconsistent. One salad had ranch dressing mixed in and the other had it on the side despite having been both ordered the same way. The lettuce was dry meaning it had not been washed prior to be served. 6. The salads were not served in a salad bowl. They were served in what I would call a chilli cup. 7. The burger was very dry; not a drop of moisture was found in it when we applied pressure. No joke. 8. The onion rings were over-fried and had a weird look to them that is hard to describe almost as if they were right out of a page of a Dr. Seuss book.  9. The buns on the burger were oily and greasy.  10. The plates that the food was served on looked like they were barrowed from a mexican restaurant. 11. The sour cream was the best looking thing on the plate that contained the quesadilla. 12. The quesadilla was monsterously huge. When she brought it out I thought maybe somebody ordered a calzone. 13. The bread on the top and bottom of the quesadilla was too greasy.  14. The chicken in the quesadilla was too large causing the contents of the quesadilla to all drop out as soon as you picked it up. 15. We must have waited at least an hour before the food came out.  16. The food took a long time to come out of the kitchen and when it did come out of the kitchen, it did not come out all at once. 17. The prices were too high, between 10-20. Items that you would think would be cheaper were a bit more expensive. I am by no means a cheap bastard.  18. The waitress recommended the most expensive item on steak menu. The cook did not have any kind of specialty. (Yes, I asked). 19. The cuts of steak were very poor quality and had lots of fat. You could see how bad it was without having to cut into the steak to find out.  20. There was a lack of silverware on our table including steak knifes.  21. It had a weird assortment of people there; I was in wonderment.  Diverti Bar and Grill sets an all time low for food. I wish I had taken a picture of it just so I would have further evidence to show that it was as bad as I've made it out to be. The style of food that we had was like no other type that I've had before. I wouldn't even serve it to my neighbor's dog. Honestly, save yourself some money and go to Jack-in-the-Box instead.

Great taco shop! Get the carna asada tacos. Squeeze some limes on them and add some salt to top it off. Perfection!  One of the best taquerias ever. All our coworkers can always agree on this place. Price is very reasonable so we always come here for lunch.

The first problem we had was upon entering the restaurant. All the seats are weirdly situated and there is no hostess or sign that says wait to be seated. All the tables and chairs were located either too close to a bathroom or too close to the kitchen since it is such a small place. The table configurations were also weird with one booth that had two tables. So imagine a normal booth and on each side there is one person and a table in between. Now imagine the same thing but with two tables in between making the distance between you and the other person twice as distant as before.  When I looked around the place it looked filthy and I did notice a fly that kept flying around, which is not something I want to see or deal with when I'm eating. The paint on the walls was brown which I can only imagine is there to hide the grime. I wonder when the last time was that the whole restaurant received a good cleaning. From the attitude of the waitress, I am doubt it has been recent. Additionally, the service station is visible and there was a tacky sign that said "EMPLOYEES ONLY" for the kitchen -- of course it is employee's only.  We had horrible service. Our waitress acted like she had somewhere better to be. She also ignored us when it came time to pay the check which we waited forever for. We tried to flag her down but she wouldn't look at us and literally walked out the front door -- doing who knows what -- only to return 15 minutes later!  I had the tandoori chicken. Overall the food was very bland; I wonder if there was salt and pepper used in the making of it. It all seemed pre-cooked. The sauce that it came with was okay. Parts of the rice seemed undercooked. It was like good rice mixed in with bad rice. The rice should be the same consistency throughout. When we got our coke it tasted like it had root beer in it. I wonder if that was because it literally had root beer in it or because the soda dispenser is not clean.   My clothes smell like curry which I could overlook had the place been good.  To the owner or manager who has been replying on all the bad reviews: don't bother doing that on this one. Just take ownership of the criticism and fix the problems. Stop trying to live off your old successes of being on a television show; there are obvious problems with reoccurring themes which you should clearly be able to see from the amount of times you've had to comment on bad reviews. You really need to call Restaurant Impossible.

I had never been here before, but I'm glad I tried it out. It was the best massage that I've ever had.

I've been getting my hair cut here for over a year now. This is the best barbershop I've ever been to in my life. He knows how to cut hair and has been doing it for many years! He takes his time and has good attention to detail when cutting hair. Perfect every time!

The trainers at this location were good. The problem I had was with the way they manage the memberships. If your credit card changes, they will refer your account to collections, rather than giving you a call. Repeated attempts to contact the collections agency only results in being transferred or hung up on. And nobody there knows the proper procedure for cancelling a membership and always refers you to an office manager which is never in the office. And even after contacting them, I was still not able to cancel my membership after having moved. The Title Boxing Club website doesn't have instructions either and e-mailing them doesn't work as nobody responds.

I know these pizza factories are new to Arizona, but they have had them in California for a long time. I have visited probably at least 5 different pizza factories in Los Angeles. I have been to Fired Pie twice so far. One time I got a Tomato Basil pizza and the other time a Cheese Pizza.   Given my past experiences with pizza factories, I can say that the pizza here tastes off. I think the problem is the dough which has a wet and soggy look and texture. It could be an indication that it is frozen dough. Additionally, I don't like how they put basil on the pizza after it has been cooked. They should soak the basil in water in those containers and put it on the pizza before it is cooked, so it gets cooked into the pizza - it tastes way better that way. And actually they don't season the pizza at all before it is being cooked. No salt, pepper, oregeno, nothing - they make you put that on after it is cooked. And it doesn't taste the same.  There is a lot of disorganization behind the counter. They start making your pizza but forget whose pizza is whose toward the end of the line - happened on both occasions, and I almost ended up with the wrong pizza the first time. And it wasn't even busy.
