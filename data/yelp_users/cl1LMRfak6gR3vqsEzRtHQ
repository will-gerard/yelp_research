UPDATE: Ach du lieber! The other day, change came to town and made me cry. Drift no longer carries Sierra Nevada. An ugly, ugly thing, I know. At present, I'm not sure how to proceed. I suppose there's always the Fat Tire. You've been warned.    ========================    Drift offers decent beer and wine selections in a pleasant atmosphere. Inside, the decor is a bit like being at Disneyland, but it works well. The food is interesting and enjoyable. Food and drinks can get pricey, but they have to pay for the atmosphere in one way or another.     As others before me have pointed out, the service at this place stinks more often than not. They also have a tendency to turn off the misting system on the patio and crank up the fire-spewing tiki torches too early, leaving you in a puddle of sweat during the hot months. They will turn them back on, though, with a request.     Drift is looking to expand its patio into the parking lot and add a waterfall. The designs look pretty cool and seem to include cabana-like havens for more private enjoyment. The remodel seems to be in the Wynn Las Vegas vein (waterfalls, lighting, etc.).    Bottom line: If you have patience for poor service from cute girls, Drift offers plenty of enjoyment.

I like Oregano's. I mean, I really like Oregano's. Rare is the occasion that I will not go there for pizza when the urge hits. The problem, it seems, is that everyone likes Oregano's. That usually means terribly long stretches spent in the Boom Boom Room trying to ease the suffering with glass after glass of Sierra Nevada. Yes, poor baby. It usually works. But on a recent occasion when my parents were visiting from out of town, the 120-minute wait time about 8:30 on a Wednesday night was too much to bear.  I've gotten stuck in this trap before. Read the review of Bada Boom Pasta Room to find out what happened the last time I didn't want to wait for a table and went searching for something faster. But wait at Oregano's we were not going to do. So, with heavy hearts and empty stomachs (as the clich might go), up the street we went to Patsy Grimaldi's.  Seating was immediate, albeit cramped. The server was polite, pleasant and attentive. They even had Sierra Nevada, though I refrained and instead drove down about a half dozen Diet Cokes. We talked and took in the comforting environment before loading up on tasty pizza. While Oregano's may not be damned, count me in as a Patsy Grimaldi's fan.  Free street parking is available nearby at the downtown Scottsdale location we were at that night. Galleries and kitschy shops provide entertainment if you're not out too late. And, of course, there are plenty of bars to belly up to after the food fun.

Oh, blessed Scottsdale. If only ye were as slick as ye has imagined. Therein lies the problem with Barcelona and her patrons.  I've long heard this place was THE place to see and be seen in Scottsdale. I knew that wasn't true and had no plans ever to go there. But a birthday party for a fine young man fueled my trip on a Saturday night.  Thankfully, we arrived shortly before 10 p.m. --- ahead of many of the plastic millionaires and their shiny chariots. Being the lame, tongue and knuckle dragging fools we are, of course, men had to shell out $10 while women were spared. Once inside, we could see where it was all heading.  It's an older crowd at Barcelona than, say, whatever club on Mill Avenue in Tempe. But that's not to say they are grown-ups. In fact, it is a lot more like high school than anything else. The uncool cool people prance around while spiced up oldies make communicating with anything other than hand gestures and swirling hips worthless. The black-suited security guards talking into their sleeves every few seconds also offer a real --- if not short-lived and ultimately comical --- feel that this place is actually hip.   In a word: Underwhelming.  Make no mistake about it, though, Barcelona is beautifully appointed. Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them. The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona. Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service. And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded.  But alas, this is no place for me. By the looks of the joint, it's no place for diners either. Middle-aged partiers with bulging eyeballs and well- yet artificially endowed gold diggers, on the other hand, are apparently welcomed with open arms. Cha, cha, cha.

A lengthy wait at nearby Bandera forced us to look elsewhere one night in January --- a rotten, regrettable idea in most any instance. By the time you find the new place to eat, generally speaking, you would have been through appetizers at the first place. What's the hurry, anyway? Well, on this particular night, I was in a hurry (for whatever reason).    Bada Boom Pasta Room had always seemed like a nice little place. They had a generous sidewalk patio, nice decor and, for the most part, agreeable music. Like the old saying goes, 'don't judge a book by its cover.' I'll let my single star do most of the talking. Just know that we didn't have a very pleasant evening and will never return.    If you must know, the service was terrible (inattentive, incorrect, unhelpful, uncaring), the food was lousy (boring, delayed, expensive) and the atmosphere went in the toilet with a poor placement at an extremely small and cramped table. Perhaps the wintertime tourists and single-visit locals can keep them afloat.

The question, of course, is: What do you order at a place named U.S. Egg? A hamburger, right? Right.  In doing so, you'll get to devour one of the best burgers to be found in downtown Scottsdale.  The second version of this two-store operation (the first is in Tempe) offers terrific breakfast and lunch grub at reasonable prices. I've had the eggs and all that. They're good, too. And, I suspect, most people come for breakfast rather than lunch. But if you're steering your car into the neighboring Red Lobster or Olive Garden, or, for goodness sake, Denny's to stuff yourself full of corporate crap, stop. Do yourself a favor and pull into the U.S. Egg. Or do other people a favor and park in the Red Lobster/Olive Garden lot and go to U.S. Egg. Perhaps the lot will, with your help, fill up and terrible eating disasters will be avoided.  Anyway, U.S. Egg has burgers, sandwiches, eggs, pancakes and all that stuff. They're open everyday until 2:30 p.m. Seating was speedy as was the friendly, helpful service during our visit. The atmosphere is mellow and the two-seat booths offer a coziness not found at other joints. It's easy to overlook this place, for whatever reason. Stick it in the back of your mind and try it out someday. I think you'll be happy you did.  * You'll find the menu, hours, addresses and other such information on the website.

OK. So, Basha's doesn't strike up images of red checkered table cloths and brick-oven pizzas. Hell, Basha is a name of Lebanese origin. But take in a slice or two of their pizza and you'll believe you stumbled into Little Italy right here in South Scottsdale (or locations around the Valley).  The folks over at Basha's Pizza Kitchen craft a hearty cheese pizza for less than $10. They usually have it baked up and ready to go in 15-20 minutes. Call ahead for take out or place an order before doing a little shopping. It's great and I think you'll like it, too.

It always starts with a feeling. I just knew our AC unit was going to go out. Call it paranoia, if you want. But that's exactly what happened early Saturday morning in the sticky, hot month of July. What's worse, of course, than warm air streaming from the vents is the thought of finding a repair company who can and will tackle the weekend job without forcing another visit to the bank mortgage officer.  Call one of the big companies, I thought. They'd have the manpower to fix it right and right away. Now was not the time to mess around with a small-time operation. A quick scan of various larger company ratings had me thinking twice about that plan, though. And then through the fog, or steam, as it might have been, beamed the great ratings of Flores Air Conditioning & Heating. A couple people in similar situations had been very happy with the Flores treatment so I started dialing.  Unless you have little kids or a busted AC unit or both, 7 a.m. Saturday likely will not find you answering work calls. But there was Miguel along with his happy greeting asking how he could help. Promising, I thought. Well, a few hours later our polite and smiling technician Michael was sweating his keister off: Pulling out a busted fan motor, faltering capacitor and giving our old unit the full treatment. A few hundred dollars later, cool air was blowing again.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the service I received that day. The guys at Flores were responsive, courteous and downright pleasant to interact with. While I hope our AC keeps pumping out cool air for years to come, Flores Air Conditioning & Heating would be my only call if it does not. Thanks, guys!
