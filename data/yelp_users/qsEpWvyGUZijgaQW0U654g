The experience was terrible.  They were rude and acted as if they were doing us the favor of serving us.  We were refused a napkin and were told the bathroom was for staff only.  Is that even legal? And at closing time they loudly announced "Leave! ". We left but are never coming back.

They have a menu for unsuspecting Americans with the classic Chinese food you would expect. The really yummy food is in the Chinese menu.  Be bold.
