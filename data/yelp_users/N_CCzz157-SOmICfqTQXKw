Ok so 1st things 1st..yes we had a coupon so maybe that started things off poorly, but this is a new restuarant and they seemingly need buisness. We were pleased with the food. Not complaints there. However we were there for 1 hr and 45 min and all we had were 3 appetizers..it took 40 min for our salad and bisque to arrive after our mussels..this was after the manager observed that it was taking a while..we also started to notice that other tables seemed annoyed as well. We would have been fine with a meer "sorry" but that is apparently too much to ask for.  We tipped 22% on the full amount of the checxk minus our coupon..then we called. The manager was so rude as to not offer a simple apology..good luck to this establishment if they decide to continue such poor customer service at such high prices...boo boo boo
