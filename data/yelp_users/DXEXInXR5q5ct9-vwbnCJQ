This place is in the perfect location. Downtown, right by the PHX Convention Center and Chase Field. I bet the vibe around gametime is insane here.  Came here for lunch one day while wandering around the Superbowl festivities. For how many people were in the city, and how busy it was, we were shocked to immediately be sat. The restaurant is laid out very well; pretty open, lots of tables, big bar, and small outdoor seating area out front.  Took a few minutes for our server to come by, but it was crazy busy so it's completely understandable. My family of three split a large Chicken Caesar Salad, and a Club Sandwich. More than enough food; large portions. There was SO much turkey on the club, we ended up taking a few pieces off and tossing them in our salad for some extra flavor! Just a tip, ask them to go easy on the salad dressing; it was a bit overwhelming as it dripped off my pieces of lettuce.  The server was friendly, made conversation with us, and was pretty quick. Sad face for his hat though - he was a Patriots fan! Boo! Go Hawks! :)  While waiting for your food, make sure you look around at all of the music memorabilia. I saw stuff from Kiss, David Bowie, and many more!

Reminded me a lot of Panera Bread, just not as good.   Ordered a pick 2 combo with a smoked turkey sandwich and a southwestern salad. I had to basically eat the sandwich as a salad, as the bread didn't even cover the half. I took one bite and it all fell apart.  My mom said the salad was pretty bland, and it was very, very small, even for a half size. It took her about 4 bites to finish it.   The line was long to order. Food came out quick though. It was very busy and very loud, and I think that the cashier couldn't do more than a whisper. We could barely hear her, and she looked like she was annoyed because of it. It wasn't our fault. Nobody had a smile on their face.   Would've gone somewhere else, but unfortunately it was the closest to my gate and my plane boarded soon.

2 stars only because the food was good. I'm a huge CF fan, at least of the ones I've been to before this one.  We came in Sunday night after the Superbowl and received absolutely terrible service. Three tables were sat after us, and all had drinks, bread, and orders taken before our server took our order. She was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes sitting at the table, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender for help. He said he would find her, but didn't. We ended up flagging down another waitress and as she was taking her order our original waitress came by, and that was the last time. She passed us off to the other girl and never looked back.  There was also a girl wearing street clothing delivering bar drinks to tables. If you didn't know any better, it would seem as though a random stranger was grabbing drinks off the bar and taking them away. That is completely unprofessional. I even overheard her deliver one to the wrong table. Also, watched the manager thank her for helping, so I guess he had no problem with working an employee off the clock (without a proper uniform).   We had wanted to get some cheesecake to go, but we so displeased and ready to go by the end of the meal we decided against it. Bummer, because I was really craving a piece of chocolate mousse after a bad day.  I love the food at CF, the tomato basil flatbread is my go to - it is the perfect size and is fantastic. The kale salad is also fabulous. I've never had an experience like this at a CF either, usually is a very good time, with great service.

P.F. Chang's is always amazing. If I could just eat their spring rolls for the rest of my life, I'd be a happy camper. (Speaking of spring rolls, they now have them in grocery stores!! You can buy them in the frozen section!! Not nearly as good as the freshly made ones from the restaurant, but mmm....they are still delightful)  Their lettuce wraps are also amazing. So are the crispy green beans. And their desserts. Oh gosh. This place is just delicious. Now I'm craving it...  I feel like the best thing to do here is just share a bunch of appetizers. I've done that in groups or just on date night, and there is always more than enough.   Pretty large restaurant, easy to find, convenient location. Lot's of parking. There is outdoor seating as well. Kinda dark inside, but that's just kinda the theme of this place; it's rather intimate. Not very loud, which is nice.  The service was mehh. Took awhile for the guy to take our food order. My dad ordered Jack on the rocks and got it neat, took an unusually long time to bring it out correctly. Always had to ask for drink refills, glasses were constantly empty. Never really prebussed the table either, lots of empty plates takes up a lot of space. 5 stars if service was better.

CPK is a great go to restaurant for some good, quality food.  Very friendly and chatty staff, the host was pretty funny.   I know, I know, you come here you should order pizza. But we weren't that hungry. Just a couple salads for us. Our server was very pleasant and attentive, very interactive with us. Always a genuine smile on her face. Wish I got her name so I could give her extra kudos. We never had to ask for a thing.  Large, open, restaurant. Very clean. I like that you can see into the kitchen, it's fun to watch them cooking.

Every time we start our descent into this place, I immediately get excited. Such great views; love the sunshine and the strip!!   Lots of decent food choices, gift shops, slot machines, and free WiFi. What more could you ask for? The gates have a lot of seating, and I've also noticed there are quite a few outlets to charge phones/laptops.   I've never really run into long lines at security here, even during peak vacation season.   The baggage claim area is huge. Like...huge. It's cool looking up at the upper level and seeing all the ads for the Vegas shows. Easy to find your way out to catch a cab or a shuttle. The lines for cabs can get long, especially in the summer. You can also rent town cars or limos right outside too.   Very convenient to get to; very close to the strip.   Also, keep an eye out for celebrities!! I've seen a few here!!  The only thing I'd really say is negative about this place is that it feels a bit outdated. With all the updated hotels, I think this place could use a bit of a makeover.

Been here 3 times for Electric Daisy Carnival! The best times of my life! It's an experience like none other, you'll feels ways you've never felt before, and see things you'll never see again.   You walk in through the tunnels and hear the echos of the music from all the stages, building the anticipation to the extreme. Then you walk out and it's just a beautiful wonderland of lights, music, friends and energy! It's hard to not be overwhelmed by emotions.   Make sure to take the time to see EVERYTHING. The black light rooms, the art, the  bars, the parades, the rides, the fun houses, the firework shows...THERE IS SO MUCH!   So many amazing artists.... Armin Van Buuren, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, Above & Beyond, Dash Berlin... I can't even right now. Just thinking about this place makes me feel so happy. Try to see a few artists you've never seen, you'll discover so many new people!   Okay, okay, the serious stuff. There are free water refill stations, so make sure to hydrate! There is an entire section dedicated to medical to make sure everyone is safe. LOTS of cops, but they don't hassle anyone - I've even seen some dancing! Some will trade kandi with you too!  There are food options and fruit stands as well. Check out the merchandise booths too and pick something up! Security is pretty tight, so just make sure to follow the rules :) The lines to get in can be long, but they go fast when everyone pays attention and has things ready. There are also misters to keep you cool, as this event is in June and it gets hot! Shuttles are the way to go as well in terms of transportation. I've heard bad things about cars being broken into and/or stolen from the lots :(  Experience EDC for yourself at least once, it is the event of a lifetime!!

Had an absolute blast here at the Superbowl!   This place is incredible looking inside and out! Whoever designed this was very creative.   Lots of parking lots, make sure you pay attention. There are signs up saying "no tailgating," but I saw plenty of people doing so for the game, so I don't know if they just allowed it because it was the Superbowl or what.   There isn't really a bad seat. Our family was split up as we weren't able to find 5 tickets together; 3 of us in the lower level end zone, and 2 up top in the 400 level in the end zone. I sat in both levels and thought the views were great. There are two huge jumbo screens too.  Pretty decent selection of food vendors. Lots of beer. Expect your normal stadium pricing.  I also heard they have AC during the summer!   Would definitely come back for another game here if I had the chance!

Ok. Let me start by saying, I did not eat or drink here. I came here for the Blue Friday 12th Man Rally for the Seahawks before the Superbowl.  The employees who were working this day worked SO hard. It was insane. The place was packed, barely even room to stand at 8am, and these servers were running around like crazy. The food looked and smelled amazing, and they sure seemed to be selling those cocktails! Everyone was so friendly as well.   I just wanted to compliment how hard these people worked. I can only imagine how great of service you'll receive from them on a regular business day.

The food here was fantastic. Came in with my family of 5 on Saturday evening. Had to wait a few minutes for a table, no big deal, as a party of 11 came in before us. We got seated near the bar in a large booth, but the table was itty bitty. Especially for 5 adults.   By checking in on Yelp, I received a free appetizer. We got the Margherita Flatbread, and it was delicious! Rather big, perfect for sharing - enough for all of us. I can't remember everything that everyone ordered, but my mom and I split the Grilled Salmon Salad and it was SO good! Splitting it was perfect size; they do offer 1/2 sizes on the salads. All of the food came out very quick as well.   Our server wasn't the best, he was very slow, and not good with recommendations. It felt as though he didn't want to accommodate my brothers request to change sauce on one of the pastas, as it took away from the taste or something like that he said. He was also very, very slow. He was too busy leaning against the counter by the computer at the end of the bar, drinking his beverage, and flirting with another server. We had to ask the manager to refill our drinks.   The restaurant it pretty large, very clean, and well decorated. The bar is rather big too, and they have a few TV in there. I will definitely come back here next time I am in town.  5 stars if the service was better.

Never, ever, rent from here. We did not receive the car we reserved online in advance. We did not get it for the price we reserved either.   The customer service attendants were so rude, and so unhelpful. All they wanted to do was argue and not try to find any solution to the problem. We ended up having to pay extra because we had 5 people in our group, and the car we reserved was supposed to fit 5, but the one they tried to give us wouldn't. She told us we could come back tomorrow and we could get the one we wanted. Ok? So were we supposed to sleep in the airport for the night to get the car we reserved a day late? Cause that sure makes sense....  The lot attendant was not helpful. She just points and goes "pick one." No instructions or anything. They didn't come to look at or note any prior damage to the car before we left, so who knows if they are going to try to charge us for all the giant scratches that were on it before we even left the lot.

I like the ambiance of this place; feels like a sports bar. Lots of big TVs, inside and out.  Loud, but not so loud you can't carry on a normal volume conversation with your group. We sat on the patio, it was nice! Great spot for people watching!   The food was good; we split the chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks. Pretty large portions for being labeled as appetizers. Saw a few burgers coming out - they looked delicious! So big! Wednesdays are like BYOB (build your own burger) night for $10!! Whatever toppings you want! That is such a deal!! I think it said Monday is like build your own mac and cheese night.  The beer list was pretty good too, lots of options, and pricing seemed about average!   The service was okay; she was definitely more interested in the tables of guys that were drinking.   Would most likely stop by again next time I am in town to try out a burger!
