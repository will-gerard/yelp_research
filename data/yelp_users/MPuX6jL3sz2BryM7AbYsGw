I used to be a pt of Doctor o'clair and she was the best doctor I've ever had. Once she left, I should have too. I won't mention the other doctors I saw because I never had a negative experience with them. Great doctors. I moved to Florida last May and called them in September to have my medical records faxed over. Then they decide to charge me the annual patient fee!? I'm not even a patient anymore and I am being charge for a fax? Very upset that the practice charges a ridiculous fee.

Driving up you wouldn't imagine the inside of this office to be what it is. It reminds me of a boutique with their great selection of glasses and sunglasses. I've never seen a doctors office with a candy bar but I appreciate that small touch for the younger patients.   I've been struggling with eye allergies and Dr. Anderson was shocked that my previous eye doctor had not taken the proper steps for my eye health. He spent the extra time explaining why he recommended new contacts and new eye drops and he answered all of my questions.   My contact order didn't show up due to the long holiday weekend but the front desk wasted no time offering me some additional trial lenses to hold me over until my order came in.   I highly recommend this office and can't wait to go back to get some new glasses.

Love the new Versa!! You can try it out for only 5$!!! Gives amazing results and the spray tan lasted about 10 days for me. I always get the light color with the prep spray, which is an additional 2$ super inexpensive compared to other salons that charge 50$ for ONE spray!

One word, food poisoning (read below)I want to give this place a good review but I just can't. Went today and received awful customer service, very slow. The private room we were in was freezing so we asked to turn it off and they server said he would do it ASAP, which he did, but it took 15 minutes to do so. Then as he finishes taking our order, he asks if we want biscuits and apple butter while we wait... Uhm hello apple butter, Yess please. About 20 minutes later 9 out of 11 meals come out, no biscuits yet. Then finally the biscuits come, so much for those coming out while we wait) and my food comes right after. We still had one person who had no food. I will say I was happy when the manager came and addressed the issue saying it should have come out with the rest of the food. She graciously took her meal off the check. Yes we had a larger group but none of us ordered complex food like ribs or pulled pork. Majority was chicken sandwiches.   My chicken sandwich was pink in the middle and I didn't notice until I got into the middle. Everyone was done eating so I just gave up. Now as I sit here at 4 am, I am wide awake due to being sicker than a dog all night.   I'm sorry for the one star but food poisoning is no joke. I will say that the apple butter lived up to its name.

I'd rather do just about anything than go to the dentist. I was referred to this office by my coworkers and of course checked Yelp. Ill be honest, I was shocked to see such positive comments about a dentist but I am now victim to the most amazing dental experience ever.   It took me about a month to get an appointment but I was in no rush as I was just going for my yearly check up. Embarrassingly enough I drove around the building about 4 times before I figured out where the heck it was. However, the person who confirmed my apt warned me they were a bit difficult to find. These things don't bother me and I laughed at myself for being blind. Parking is the back is covered, which in Arizona is the best thing since sliced bread.   Upon walking I the receptionist was on the phone but acknowledged me and handed me paper work. Once I finished she apologized for being on phone but kindly introduced her self and directed me toward the waiting room with comfortable couches and water and coffee.   Right on time the hygienist (I can't remember her name :/) gave me the grand tour of the office and made sure I was comfortable with the appointment to come.  Getting X-rays are not fun but she talked me through the entire process and made me feel like I've been a life long patient.  She did the typical clean but for the first time in my life I felt no pain at all. How does she do it? I'll never know but I left with no inflamed gums and a whiter smile! The tv on the ceiling was a pretty awesome added bonus.   The doctor had actually come from the airport to come see patients and I think that says worlds about her. She was kind and informative and I really enjoyed chatting with her.   Weird to say but I can't wait to go back to the dentist for my 6 month check up!

I'll admit I was a lite hesitant about going here after reading some of the reviews. We walked in to a friendly ticket counter woman who directed us toward the bar and told us that seating would open up shortly. I ordered some girly drink and enjoyed it. I will say for a drink in Scottsdale, it was perfectly priced.   I will say I wish that we could chose our own seats but hey, I appreciate that they are organized and we ended up getting great seats.   The mc wasn't really my style and I didn't find him overly funny, but hey, who cares. You can't make everyone laugh.   I'm shocked about the reviews about the owner not being funny because I was laughing the entire time he was on stage. Howard was absolutely hilarious and I'd pay to see just his act any day. I enjoy that he mentioned that if anyone needed anything at all to not hesitate to mention something so he can make it right.   My only complaint was my second drink. I ordered a mojito and it didn't taste at all like a mojito but more like sweet and sour. I couldn't find our server so I went up to the bar and told the bartender it didn't taste right. He did give me a little bit of an attitude but ended up letting me swap it for a beer instead. I let him know I wouldnt mind being charged for both, I just wanted a drink haha. Our server came back and let us know they took it off the check and apologized. Also, the bathrooms aren't awesome but it's an old building so I wouldn't expect them to be equivalent to the ritz.   The main comedian, I forgot his name, maybe Adam, was so great. I was laughing so hard my eyes were watering.   We had a great date night and we will for sure be back.
