I think if it costs 12.95 to wash my car, at least they could do is make sure my windows are clean. My floors still looked like it wasn't vacuumed either. Lastly, there was trash still in my cupholders.

Got yelled at by a disgruntled pool attendee. Didn't want to argue. Normally I spend my entire day at the pool.  I stayed less than 1 hour.

Spartacus is, hands down, the best barber in town. He takes pride in his work, doesn't rush anything, and gives what customers want.  Highly highly recommended. He has a customer for life in me.

I took a huge detour to try their Sul Lung Tang, a beef broth Korean dish that's easy to find back home in LA. Along with the Korean drama that was playing on a huge flat screen, it kinda reminded me of my mom's cooking. If this place was any closer, I would be their number one customer.

This only applies to their pho. It's basically hot water, meat, and noodles. There is no flavor whatsoever.

Paid close to $9 for burned potatoes that were tasteless and dry. Said light cheese on spinach and mushroom eggs, came with no cheese. Seems like just another overpriced joint to me. Won't be going back.

So I went back and tried it one more time at the request of the owner. No more hard potatoes. They changed it to hash browns. Pretty good.

I would say check your credit card statement after buying anything from here. I bought a $10 premade salad from the fridge, left no tip, and found out later that someone filled in a generous 4 dollar tip. Salad was good, tho.
