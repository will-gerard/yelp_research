Extremely mediocre food, served by delightful, friendly people.That's the best way to describe this place.  We ordered California Rolls, and found them small, dry and not flavorful. Much like Grocery Store packaged sushi.  The edamame was the worst I have ever had. It was obviously just 'nuked' and some of the beans had white areas on them from frost burn in their freezer. Really, avoid these!  The teriyaki chicken bowls, which we were expecting based on the reviews here to be delicious, were only . . . "so so" at best. The meat was chewy, there was some gristle thrown in for good measure, and in general, it was a big disappointment. I went in on a Groupon type special and felt that we got our money's worth, but just barely.  On the positive side, the serving size was nice on the bowl, and the women serving/making the food were very sweet and friendly. I hope their business does well, but I assure Yelpers that it will require them to upgrade their quality or this place won't be there long.

I really wanted to like this place. I live nearby and I love the Downtown area. I want all the places here to be 4-5 star joints. But my partner and I showed up on a Sunday afternoon, with only a half-dozen people in the place and just as many waitresses, and they still took 45 minutes to deliver our food. We watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar. And then when our food came it wasn't right.  We ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our bread was more than day-old. I actually had to ask them if it was toasted (it wasn't) because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread. Back it went.  The pizza which I ordered because of the Kalamata Olives (their "Mediteranean") was missing Kalamata Olives. That's right -- it's the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on.   Never mind, after 45 minutes you'll eat anything. Beer was overpriced at $5 for a glass. We got out of there as quickly as we could after the food was consumed. Won't be back.

We've had both of us (husband and wife, 60's) in this center and we should have taken our first impressions and avoided them forever. The doctors are way too busy to provide any real patient care. After a visit, we've tried to follow up with a question, and you "can't hear from the doctor" -- you have to go back if you have a question about his recommendations, no matter how little the question. They did a horrible job on a colonoscopy, as well, and didn't provide enough medication to knock me out. All in all, we would say this is a very bad center for patient care and the concern level of the doctors is almost non-existent.

We had a great night here last night for our anniversary and we brought our 23 year old son from Los Angeles to celebrate with us. We loved our night, but that was mostly because we were with this young guy who we don't get to see very often. The white bean soup had very few white beans and was basically an overly-salty italian soup. The filets were delicious but extremely overpriced as was the pork tenderloin. The service was great, and they brought a few strawberries and some whipped cream as an anniversary treat for us.   We like Coup des Tartes but the only time we can afford going here is when they offer a Groupon or some discount. Honestly, the prices on their regular menu are just sky high. It's very disconcerting when you first walk in and look at the menu. I hate to see another restaurant that we enjoy being converted to another one of those places that ONLY works when you have a Groupon in hand.   I'd like to suggest to the owners of Coup des Tartes that they take a serious look at the menu pricing and cut it back a bit. Stop with the Groupons and focus on providing a value and we'll be there once a week.  Review Updated on 8/7/2012:  Wow, did we have a disaster with this restaurant. I originally gave it a three star rating. I think their food does still merit a 3 star, but I am going to downgrade them one notch for the way I was treated the other day.  We had a Groupon (yes, they still focus on those promos) and it was going to expire in five or six days. We left a message early AM for a reservation for that night, and then never had a returned call. That was the first bad sign. When we called back and spoke to the owner, the guy was rude and just plain nasty. No, they had no reservations that night, and the other nights we suggested (mid-week) they couldn't get us in before 9 or 9:30 and so on . . .  Later, I called Groupon and asked what they suggest. They told me that as long as you make your reservation before the cut off date, the restaurant will still honor your full value of the Groupon on the date you go in, even though it is after expiration. I called and unfortunately the same guy got on the line. "No way" he replied - "That's not how we work Groupons. You only get half the value - the amount you paid." So I put him on the line with the Groupon rep, who told us both that the guy has to honor the Groupon. Well, he opted not to do so and hung up. Honestly, this restaurant is cute and the food's not bad, but with an owner like this, why patronize them? On Saturday, when we could have been in there arguing with this fellow over our bill, we chose to have dinner at Durant's. Now THAT is a 5 star romantic restaurant. Please, avoid places like this where management is not on your side, the customer.

It's a bad feeling when you walk away from a restaurant feeling that you've been ripped off. It can spoil the experience when you are focused on what you paid, and not on enjoying the savory feeling of the food in your mouth.  My wife and I, at the Wrigley Mansion for my birthday, couldn't believe that this place is racking up a high average review. It was unbelievably bad. The food was marginal -- so marginal that we wondered, are we in the same restaurant that these others reviewed? And the "deal" that we went in with . . .  wow, what a loser. We had a Travelzoo prepaid voucher, which was supposedly worth $120. That voucher was for an appetizer, a soup or salad, and an entree. According to them, this voucher would pay for food for two that would at its normal price be valued at $120. And they base their add-on gratuity on this inflated figure, as well as the tax.  What did we get? The appetizer was a one or two bite item -- two one-bite crab cakes, the size of quarters, and a teacup with one escargot in the bottom of it (our choices). The bowl of soup was actually a teacup as well. The entree we both had was a salmon, a very small filet, and when one of us expressed a concern about an allergy, they took the side dish away that contained the allergen and didn't replace it with anything. Most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute.   We ended up paying, after they added the gratuity in and the taxes based on the inflated retail price, nearly $120 for this dinner for two that included only two drinks, a well drink with house rum and a house cabernet.  That was our "voucher deal" price. That's absurd . . . the Salmon dinner could be had in a larger portion in any restaurant in town for $18-24. The cup of soup perhaps $5-7 and the microscopic "tasting" of an appetizer would be a courtesy item or certainly no more than a few $$. How does this equate to what we paid?  While the views are nice at the Wrigley Mansion and the place itself is unique, this operation is using it as an excuse to gouge. Don't visit this establishment -- seriously, like many others, you will regret it. Stay as far away as you can from Geordie's. Spend your money at innumerable restaurants with better value in other parts of Phoenix. (The night before we spent $50 at St. Francis and it was incredible).

Wow -- What a poor business on customer service and follow-up!  We bought $7,000 worth of product from this company and had to deal with them sometime later, after the product was installed and the problems began to show up. The product problem was not in the quality of the brand (they sell some good products) -- Instead, it was a problem with the quality of the installation. We spoke to "Jim Maley" there, and honestly I've never spoken to a ruder person. I don't know how a quality company like this could treat people this way, with a customer service attitude that I can remember a year later. Terrible! Watch out if buying from this company. Deal with your problems immediately and do not count on any kind of customer service or concern on the part of management for you. Once you buy it, it's yours and so are the problems, according to Mr. Maley.

I had the worst haircut of my life from the Steven Paul salon. Ron was a nice enough guy, but honestly he spent so much time telling me about himself that he didn't pay attention to what he was doing. When he finished, I think even he was shocked at how badly it had come out. I would be very cautious about going to this salon and using this stylist unless you have a secret to keep him focused on your hair and to avoid the "robot mode" he goes into when he starts talking himself up. Just a word to the wise.

We attended an event which was promoted as "Beat the Heat -- Arizona Winterfest" at The Venue Scottsdale today. First off, let me suggest to other promoters that before they commit to a venue for their affair, they should check Yelp reviews. I hope my review turns some future promotors off this location . . . It was, in one word, a disaster.  The idea for the event was a good one. Have a bunch of microbreweries organized to offer their wares in a nice, cool "Wnterfest" environment. Instead, because of inept management at The Venue and nothing else, it turned out to be "A Day in Hell" for anyone who attended. It was --quite literally -- between 95 and 100 degrees inside the hall. Everyone was mopping their head and wondering, "How did I get into this mess?" Really, where would you go in Phoenix in the summer to be in outside temperatures while inside a hall event? Who would put people through such an agonizing episode?   Because of the heat, people were affected more than normally by the alcohol. The Scottsdale police showed up, wondering why there were so many people getting physically sick. While people were inside trying to get a few beers to pay for their $25 investment, each of them anxious to get out and find some aircon, a fresh batch of suckers would be lined up outside, standing in the sun and waiting to get inside. I guess the promotor could be laughing all the way to the bank? If management had simply cranked the AC down all night long to prepare for this, it could have been salvaged. If you are considering The Venue for any kind of event in our hot months, literally six months of the  year, you ought to reconsider. The place is looking a bit shabby on the inside, there is no air conditioning to speak of, and there's a great shortage of restrooms. Think twice -- this place is a dump.

I wanted to like this place, I really did. It's kinda Euro cool and feels like it might be really unique. I love the old Tempe style tall brick walls and the clean interior design. We were greeted with a friendly smile and a "no worries" from our waitress. However, at that point, it went downhill so fast. First off, we ordered a couple of latte's, and found them to be lukewarm instead of hot (plus, they were all foam, which means the barman was having trouble with the difference between capuccino's and latte's). They remade them and we set about having a good time once again. But then, our waitress was noticeably absent most of the time. It took forever to order the food. Forever to get the food. Forever to get the bill. Just absolutely terrible service. Meanwhile, while we're doing all this waiting, there are three or four waitstaff and a manager hanging around and chatting by the cash register. I think this place has potential, but I would call my investment in Caffe Boa a disaster. We won't be back.

We were very disappointed with this place. We drove over to Tempe, to a blasted out, deserted shopping center that looked like it closed due to a depression, and there it was in the corner, still open while everything around it was closed. It's a nice little spot inside, comfortable enough.  This is another one of those places that thrives on the Groupon phenomenon. Prices are jacked up to accommodate a discount. I bought a $6.50 bottle of beer (as one example). My pizza, a sausage pie, came out burned. I know that a good pizza has a "flame kissed" look to it, even at top places like Bianco's. But this pie was flame-licked, and there's a difference. I tasted charcoal more than I did sausage.   The folded and stuffed Calzone was not burned, but neither was it stuffed so full that it's busting its seams which is the way we like it. Lots of air inside this Calzone. I'lll take the dramatically less expensive Calzone at Mama Mia's on Indian School any day over this hot-air filled version.  The service was good, with a very friendly waitress helping us out. She should have noticed the burnt pie, however. If they reduce the inflated Groupon prices, I'd go back when they bring in some reasonable draft beer and start putting more care into their preparation of the food.

We've long heard about this restaurant, but frankly we don't dine in expensive steak houses all that often. Last time, I made the mistake of going to a Ruth Chris (Anaheim) and having a real disappointment. Here, the prices are about the same (high) but you get an experience to go along with it.   As others have stated, we walked through the kitchen to enter the restaurant and WOW what a clean place that was, filled with cheerful workers who greeted us as we walked in. I felt like Frank Sinatra when I walked through their kitchen - it was certainly a flashback to a better, earlier day.   The wait staff was fantastic - guys in white jackets moved aside for my wife as she walked in, making her feel like a special lady. Our server, Patti, gave us her business card. How often do you get a business card from a server? She TRULY cared about her guests. There were large bouquets of fresh flowers everywhere, even in the ladies room. There was a pay phone in the ladies room -- a real blast out of the past when ladies had to use a phone to get out of the occasional bad date.   The food was even better than the great atmosphere and staff. My wife's filet was perfectly cooked and my Prime Rib was the largest, juiciest slice of meat (about an inch and a half thick) that I've had in years. Really, really good food that we are still talking about a day later. We'll be thinking/talking about this meal for a long time.  Make sure you order their Key Lime Pie or their Signature Strawberry Shortcake. Both were superb. My son and I also enjoyed the bread with special garlic, basil and leek treatment. Wow.  Thank you Durant's for making our 35th anniversary so special! We will be back soon, I'm sure.

My wife and I had a Living Social coupon and so we decided to try the place, but when we went by, the sign on the door said they were on vacation. Bad sign -- we're not from the area and we couldn't get back until after the coupon expired. Management offered to extend it for us, however. which was great because we were then able to try this really good Mexican food.   We both had the Los Dos Flautas special, which consisted of two very large and filling flautas filled with shredded beef or chicken. The beef was absolutely delicious -- just mouth watering, juicy and not too spicy. This restaurant is famous for it's hot, spicy foods so we were happy to find an entré that did not have too much zip. The flautas had a great guac and some very fresh sour cream, along with rather average rice but really excellent beans.   I only wish this restaurant would have a low-powered gringo version of their salsa. Neither one of us could dip their excellent chips into the offered sauce. Too hot by far!

I'm modifying my original 2-star review because I just went back to the Compass and had what my wife and I consider to be the meal of our lifetime. I'm not kidding . . . it was as good as good gets. It makes me think that my original experience, where we were very disappointed by a 45 minute wait past our reservation hour, must have been a fluke. As long as you remember to use the Regency Garage and not the hotel valet, you'll have a great night. They will validate you for two hours at the Garage, but at the valet in front they will only give you a $2 discount.  My wife and I both ordered the "Filet Oscar," which was the best piece of meat we've ever had in any restaurant. It was cooked to perfection, with a generous helping of crab meat on top of the steak. The large, generous portion of asparagus the steak was served atop (nearly 1/2 inch thick stalks) was steamed just right.   The side dishes are a value at $5 and were healthy portions. My wife loved the corn bread, which is a special recipe, and the waitress (a very special gal named Patty) came back to us with a copy of the recipe.  The wine selection by the glass is excellent and Patty recommended a wonderful Argentinian malbec that was just great with the steak. Wines by the glass here are available in two sizes -- they are expensive, but it looks like they are upgraded bottles than most restaurants serve by the glass.  The food is pricey here also but you'd expect to be paying for the view. Speaking of the view, WOW. There's Phoenix laid out in front of you for your inspection, making for wonderful dinner table conversation. it would be a great place for couples and special evenings, or because of the view, a great place to bring a business acquaintance where you want to impress them with some wonderful views of the Valley of the Sun.  The ride up the elevator is great, too. As I said in the beginning, however, don't use the valet unless you want to fork over some serious change to park. The Compass needs to work out a deal with valet parking in my opinion -- that's the only hitch. I hope your night is as special as ours was.

We've been to The Vig a number of times, always at night time, always on the Patio, and never for food. Just for cocktails and to hang with the cool people. But today, we went to The Vig for lunch. It was a completely different, and very disappointing, experience.  First off, for lunch you get to see what the place looks like with the lights on, so to speak. What used to be a cool and high-design kind of atmosphere (and that still looks that way at night) is really rough and showing some wear during the day. Dirty floors under our booth at 11:15 AM, the booths themselves looking a bit shabby, etc. We forgave them when what looked like a couple of great sandwiches showed up. Certainly not an inexpensive place to eat, though -- my roast beef was a $14.00 item all to itself. The food was "Ok to Good."  Our biggest disappointment, and the bulk of the reason for the low rating I'm giving this establishment, is the service. Wow, was it bad. This woman could care less about us, and left us sitting there for 20+ minutes while we were trying to pay our bill and get out of there. Later, I found that her "who gives a s***" attitude was because she was locked in for an 18% tip on the prepaid coupon I brought in (we had a "Deal Chicken"). I think it's really a poor choice for a restaurant to trust its waitstaff to the degree where they write a gratuity into the promotion . . . This woman had no concerns, because she was up for a nice tip no matter what we thought of her caring, concerned attitude (sarcasm intended).   We might try the Vig again, but I'll certainly avoid lunch and stick with a cocktail or a happy hour appetizer. My recommendation is to avoid ANY groupon/promotion with this business -- that forced gratuity doesn't give you the leverage to punish someone who should know better.

I had an earlier review of this place's performance at lunch which had a higher rating. Last night, however, took the cake. There was a horrible, really awful, stench out on the back deck of The Vig. It smelled like an entire family of rats had died underneath our table. It was the smell of death, or of a really dirty restaurant. It wasn't pleasant. Unfortunately, it started up as we were halfway into our meal.   I know that the patio of The Vig is a popular hangout, so I am actually baffled as to what's wrong with manager Pam and others in management who hear about this from customers and yet don't do anything? They say "It's not our fault. It's the restaurant next door, with stinky dumpsters." As is true in the rest of your life, making excuses doesn't help. The only thing that would help is the complete elimination of the odor. Others were going inside the restaurant to eat. We stayed and finished our meal -- only later were we surprised no one had offered to move us inside as well. My guess is that if they had, about ten tables would have volunteered to move -- and they couldn't fit everyone inside if that was the case.   I wrote a note on my check hoping someone would take pity on us and offer a free drink or something for my next visit. But no . . . Not even a call to management the next day resolved this. "Not our problem" was the response.  Unbelievable.

You wouldn't believe the experience we had here. We arrived on a Thursday night at 8:00 PM, for the Arizona -Oregon game and some food. All the other bars in Old Town Scottsdale were packed. This place had about three tables occupied. While we had a great server, cute and sweet and friendly, we noticed how they kept serving beer to a table of about six guys who were really outrageously drunk. I mean they were really tanked -- loud, obnoxious, and using the F word in every other sentence.   They had some kind of altercation with our sweet waitress and left in a huff. We were leaving about the same time, and my wife and I stumbled into them at the door of the bar where they had stopped, put their you-know-what's in their hands, and were pissing all over Blitz's floor. It was a real treat to see what we saw (not really) and my wife screamed for the manager. He came running, but the guys had all taken off down the street. The bar manager didn't offer to do anything for us. I think "Come on, let me buy you a drink" would have been an appropriate response for that one.   I rate the place with one star because of this experience. It feels like it is going out of business in the next few days, it's dead, plus the food was only marginal and I had a choice of three lousy beers because their taps were dead on others. I would avoid this establishment at all costs.

Wow, a lot of rave reviews here. Somehow I think that company management has slipped us all a mickey . . . perhaps Uncle Mickey,  because he and Aunt Phylis and all the kids are posting here. That's because I can't find any of this stuff they are raving about.  OK, yes it is hidden and hard to find. But does that by itself make it good? In my opinion, this is one of those restaurants that is making a killing off Groupon and other promotions. I think that we're now seeing a certain type of restaurant emerge that actually LIVES OFF OF those "daily deal promotions." While my wife and I were eating, I saw two other transactions in which someone handed the Groupon coupon to the waiter.   That's OK if its normally priced, or a good deal, because than Groupon is introducing you to something special and you're getting an even better deal. But hey . . . $9 drinks? $5 bottles of beer? These prices at a place where you have to sit on rinky-dink plastic outdoor furniture with wobbly tables just like you might see at the "patio" outside some cheazy taco joint or fast food place.  My wife ordered a THIRTEEN DOLLAR appetizer, because it was one of the cheaper things on the menu and it included four scallops that someone had squirted some sauce over. That's it. LIterally gone in four bites. While my dish was larger, and the pork and mashed potatoes tasted good, it just didn't make our expectations after reading Yelp reviews.  I like to support small, hidden out of the way places, and I enjoy the kind of latin fare that this restaurant promotes. But I'd like to see fair treatment of the customer first and foremost. Offering a pint of draft beer at a fair price and a mojito special would be one way to start on that path, Fuego. Reducing your dependency upon the "jack up the price and then offer them a Groupon discount" would be a second suggestion.

Wow, did we enjoy this theater! I live only a few minutes away, and we hadn't been back since they renovated. We are so happy to see someone investing money into the Esplanade, because inept management of the complex has caused some merchants to leave or go out of business (really grungy, scary garage and elevators bothers a lot of people). But now, with AMC updated like this, there could be a resurgence coming to the Esplanade area! It is the most unique theater experience you can find anywhere. We've been to UltraStar and others who serve food and drink and this is far better. They really pulled it off.  The "fork and screen" theaters are less expensive and they are just like a traditional show with a somewhat nicer leather seat and a tray with a call button for service. The wait staff is friendly and outgoing (thanks Brittany!). But we enjoyed the "CinemaSuites" section of the theater so much more than the "Fork and Screen" side. In the CinemaSuites section, there are huge screens combined with exotic, electric retractable lounge chairs and dining trays that swing in and out of position. I was literally as comfortable as I would be on my own couch (more so!!) and the service was great. I had a White Chocolate Expresso Blender to drink and a delicious bacon cheeseburger. They brought us a little popcorn snack with chocolate in it that was not ordered, nor charged, and it was delicious.   The theater itself has state of the art sound and as I said, a great big screen. It was expensive ($12) but I think very much worth it. There aren't that many seats in the theater because of the amount of room they give you around each seat -- it's really super luxe. Comparing this with an airline, the seats and service are like first class here compared to the tourist/economy seating of a standard show seat like a Harkins. We get it, AMC -- we see what all the fuss is about. This is the way to see movies. The only-average movie we went to see ("The Iron Lady") was made so much better by the comfort and care they gave us. Highly recommended.  The only negatives we had is the continued dirty, grungy appearance of the parking area and the elevator. I agree with another poster that there's too much "Security" presence, but they never bothered us or made us uncomfortable.

We went to Donovan's last night for my wife's Birthday celebration. It's a lovely place, in a sort of "typical" Chicago or NY style steak house style. Dark, nice wood, lots of staff to take care of you, and a really nice looking bar. We felt the food was of overall good quality, but we were disappointed in a couple of ways. As customers, we'll get a little pickier when the price goes up. I'm used to Durant's for this kind of food -- it's a bit more reasonable, and always good.   I have an allergy. I told them about it two weeks prior when we made the reservation. They remembered it when they introduced themselves to us -- which was nice. But then, the first thing they put on the table (the bread) they had absolutely no idea what was in it. Our server asked a person in the kitchen who said one thing. Then, the main chef said another thing, and basically I was left on my own. (I risked it and turned out OK). But, for the money, this place should have a book they look at for all ingredients and allergens. Really -- if a McDonalds can do it, they should be able to.  Our filet was served Medium and it was bright red, cherry red, throughout. I feel that's a bit underdone. It tasted very good, however. The side dish we ordered of creamed spinach was very small. I'm used to Steak Houses providing family sized portions when you order side dishes. Our server deserted us throughout the bulk of the meal. She was a delightful person, but she spent more time at the larger tables and never asked us about our steak.  Overall, a pleasant evening but not everything that it could have or should have been. Added on Jan 3, 2015: We had an email from Donovan's, from a manager, who said "C'mon back and get a couple of free deserts. We want to take care of you," and then she never sent the coupon she promised. Later individuals had no idea what we are talking about. Figures!

We had absolutely terrible experiences with this company. We called many times, leaving messages because no one answers the phone -- EVER. After an extended phone tag, we finally reached them. For example, it took over 2 weeks to get a phone call from the owner! They don't even ask your name, they file everything by "your cross streets." I agree with the other reviewer - this fellow is in way over his head. Anyway, we finally had one scheduled and then the cleaner calls and wants to bring a 2-yr old child along for the three or four hours she would be in our home. How unprofessional this outfit is - stay away!

This is a weird review, because St. Francis is one of our favorite restaurants. We're "regulars" there -- but, after last night's experience (one-star) we are going to be taking a break for quite some time. We've been there regularly over the last three years, and recommend the restaurant to friends and out-of-owners. The atmosphere is nice and the people have always been very caring and thoughtful. I have a terrible allergy, and they (with one exception) have always kept my meals free of my problem foods.  Last night was a disaster, however. We went for the Happy Hour, which I see gets good reviews here on Yelp. The problem is that their Happy Hour menu is integrated into the standard menu, in a way that perhaps the person who designed it understands, but not necessarily the casual reader. We came in, saw a giant blurb on the menu that said "Happy Hour -- Cocktails $5" and selected a couple of cocktails when the initially attentive waitress came up to the table.   Later, however, that waitress proved completely inattentive, concerned solely with another large table nearby. We must have called out to this woman a half-dozen times, trying to get her attention, without success. Over and over again, we'd call to her when she was just three feet away taking care of the large table, and she would keep her back to us. (We're normally very easy-care customers -- we just wanted to check on ingredients for one dish, due to allergies.)  When the bill came, the $5 cocktails proved to be $12 each! It was a shocker, to say the least. I asked the waitress, who we did see again at time for our bill, to please correct the charge and she said that the menu is "quite clear" about cocktails, and these were not included in the Happy Hour. I looked over the menu, and saw her point -- but it was sure confusing. There's a tiny mark next to certain drinks. There's no explanation of what that mark means (we assumed it was just a "Bartender's Favorite" kind of notation), but evidently only certain drinks are included in the discount, and not the ones we ordered.  Personally, I'd say that when customers come in and order a Happy Hour food special, and the cocktails they order are NOT on the HH menu, the wait staff needs to clarify the pricing in advance. If you're going to print a menu with this kind of confusing detail on it, you'll need to ensure that waiters are not going to be confrontational when someone expresses a miscommunication has occurred. This gal wasn't nasty, but she made us feel like we were real dummies because we didn't read their wacky menu correctly.  In this case, two regulars (who have always loved this place) will now avoid St. Francis and hopefully find when we next visit that we don't sit in her section, and that the Happy Hour menu is clear, or that management will at least "get" that not everyone understands their hieroglyphics and what it means about the price of your food.

AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a high-quality, local provider of entertainment (Harkins) and they really pale in comparison. Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center, which is literally right near our house, but we've been there only two or three times in as many years. Why? Because AMC doesn't offer a senior discount any longer.  For AMC Management -- Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week? I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for $12-13 for two but when it's an AMC Theater, it's $20. Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra "tax"?  The theater is generally clean and nice, but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high, combined with the fact that they don't offer the discount to seniors. AMC, please just fold up your tent and go away. We don't need you here.

Let's get some clarification right now. This is NOT A COOKING CLASS, nor is it a place you can go to learn to cook. Instead, it is simply a place where they have a production line setup with various prepared ingredients and a few select recipes that change every month. You can go in there and "make dinner" for your family in their kitchen, and then take it home and cook it. Voila! A "home cooked" meal. For me, I was greatly disappointed that I basically learned nothing about cooking, and that I couldn't do anything on my own without the prepared ingredients and special process they use here. Plus, they simply sit you at a station and you do the steps noted in their recipe. While there is someone available to answer your questions, he or she is no "teacher" and you are not in a cooking class. Unfortunately, various coupon specials have referred to it that way.

Here's a restaurant that has absolutely ZERO control over their kitchen and their wait staff. I'm highly allergic to eggs, so when I order something I always request that they check with the chef first to ensure I'll be safe. I ordered one of their Widow Maker burgers during happy hour and twice asked the waiter about the egg issue. He assured me it was fine. When it came, it had a sauce that looked suspiciously like mayonnaise. When he went back to the kitchen, he must have asked the dish washer about the eggs, because he came back and said "All OK" and I dove in. Within three minutes, I was in the restroom choking. It was LOADED with eggs. When you are in business to serve people food and you can't get your kitchen to prepare something without eggs, that's a sad state of affairs. The boss was called over, a guy named Paul, and he basically did nothing. We left with a $20 bill and sick as a dog. The food my partner had was served luke warm and was marginal at best. This is not a quality establishment, for sure!

This place is a rip-off. We called to make a reservation on a discounted spa services promotion we had (discount at $69 for a 50 minute massage!) and they took all my credit card information and then tried to charge us another $25 there on the phone for the GRATUITY! How in the world can a place change a $25 gratuity on a $70 service, even before you walk in the door and experience the service? Gratuities are not something you jam down someone's throat, but something that you get because of a quality service. Unfortunately, they told us this only after taking all of our credit card details.

This establishment looks cool -- kind of a western themed Hooters, but with a much larger menu. And, I've actually had a pretty good burger served here. However, the place has such problems with service. These problems are so aggravating that I wouldn't even waste time going to this restaurant. It might be OK for a beer on the patio during Happy Hour, but steer clear of expectations of having no problems with your bill, or the food served properly, etc. I went in with a coupon that was clearly valid and that I had paid for. They refused to accept it because it was electronic (my phone, the coupon company says that you don't need to print them out) and not on paper . . . "We're not very sophisticated here," said the manager. That is an understatement.

I've bought my tires here for years, and never felt like I was getting ripped. One day on a purchase of one tire from road damage, I happened to look at the receipt and I compared the price of the tire with that brand and model on the internet. I found it several places for $50 less (per tire). When I showed that to the fellow, he said "Well, just add in the shipping and you'll see that our price is fair." The shipping was $15, and so I wanted my $35 refund -- this was right when I was still in their shop. Basically, he just argued the point and didn't want to do anything about it despite their "pricing guarantee." Then, for the first time in 10 years, I really looked at their receipt. They had indicated to me that I had a "free installation," but they had charged me $17 for balancing which is normally free when you buy a tire elsewhere. They wouldn't give me their price guarantee despite the evidence right in front of them, and they charged me for their free installation. That's enough right there to drop it to 2 star. I would have given them a one-star rating but the work they did was OK, so I kept it to 2 stars. Having just read about the founder in Phoenix Magazine and how he's now a billionaire, I think he could perhaps spare me the $40 for a customer doing business with them a decade!

What a wonderful anniversary night we had at this beautiful restaurant. The host, Jonathan, was a wonderful guy. When he heard it was our anniversary, we were treated very special. But, I'm sure that they treat all their guests special here. It's that kind of place.  We both had a delicious filet. It was perfectly cooked, and surrounded by the most wonderful au jus and vegetables. There was a surprise with some great tasting very thick pieces of bacon in the sauce, and the best tasting little onions and tomatoes you've ever had on top. We met the chef, who has a German name, but who is Italian by birth from Northern Italy. He is a gem. Everything we had that night was simply delicious.   While it's clearly not an inexpensive restaurant, you get what you pay for. The filet was huge, and each of my side dishes was mouth-watering. We had the Panna Cotta for desert and it was labeled "Happy Anniversary" around the edges of the plate in chocolate. Seriously, this was one of the finest meals of our lives. Highly recommended

This yogurt shop has the single highest price in the city of Phoenix for their treats. And there is nothing special at all about their yogurt! Really lacks quality toppings as well (for example, they don't have Reeses Peanut Butter Cups -- they have "PB Cups" ripoff tiny things with no flavor). The store is always dirty, the ingredients mixed up and messy, the yogurt machines dripping. They have no reason to charge 10-12% more than anyone else for the same yogurt. Plus, they don't post ingredients so if you have an allergy to eggs or other ingredients, you can't find out if you are safe!!! Plus, no calorie postings!

This yogurt is as good as it gets. Plus, they are fair and reasonable to the consumer, with prices at 37¢ per ounce which is OK in a day and age where cute little yogurt shops are opening and trying to get like 44¢ per ounce. The store is always clean and fresh, and they have a wonderful selection of flavors, constantly changing. The staff is friendly and nice, and they offer a great variety of toppings. Their toppings bar is kept clean and cold, and is the best one in Phoenix. I'd like to request that the owners put up allergens warnings on their machines if the yogurt contains eggs or nuts. Updated Jan 2015: Still our favorite yogurt place. Great flavors, friendly staff. Nice going Yogurtland!

Dirty floors, dirty peanuts, and the worst customer service you are ever going to experience. That's "Teakwoods" in a nutshell.  Sometimes a good dive bar can be fun. That is, when the bar is clean. While Teakwoods likes to position themselves as something above a dive bar, the environment they foster isn't much better than that. There are peanuts everywhere. I love peanuts, but these things are dusty and dirty, and they sit around in huge containers on the tables. Instead of supplying fresh peanuts every day, these guys must buy them in bulk and store them in a shed somewhere, bringing them in by the shovel to put on tables once a week. A week's supply of dirty, filthy peanuts on your table to wash down with your beer. Just what I want to look at when I am eating a meal!  The food is absolutely nothing to rave about. The wings are just "so so" . . . the only thing I found I liked there was the supply of cheap beer. And when that's your high point, you can imagine the crowd you'll attract isn't exactly the norm for a "Grill." I'd say that they've misnamed this place -- Its really more like Teakwood's Bar. There's no tavern here, no grill. Just a dive bar full of dirty peanuts and people who couldn't give a hoot about you except to get you in and pour cheap beer down your gullet.

I bought a prepaid coupon from a daily deals site for this location. What a terrible car wash. They left a lot of bugs on my grille, "forgot" to put in the fragrance that is included, and in general did just about nothing inside the vehicle. I usually get my car washed from Danny's Family across from Trader Joe's on 20th St. -- the difference between the two "The Works" washes is incredible. This place has a lot of work to do to catch up with their competition. I called and spoke to the manager about the poor job and the missing fragrance,  and he let me know he could care less. Also, during the visit, there was a glass salesman they allowed on their site and he pestered us for ten minutes about our window. [Review updated after final coupon used: This place tries to "get you" any way they can. High pressure salespeople trying to up the price of your car wash. Window repair guys trying to tell you there's something wrong with your window, etc. Whatever you do, do not frequent this car wash company. They are terrible!!]

My review is not of the services they provide, but of the quality of the management of this business. They ran a promotion for a "Living Social" discount prepaid Pedicure and Body Massage, and when we tried to schedule it (a week from its expiration) they had some kind of story about not being able to offer the deal as sold any longer. No offer of refund, no substitutions, just "sorry, nothing we can do."  Of course, Living Social was upset at the way they treated us and, luckily, refunded our money. I'd avoid this operation if I were you!

My family went on a Segway tour up at the JW Marriott Resort, off of Deer Valley out by the Desert Ridge Marketplace. The guys there were great  . . . our guide was Aaron, and he was terrific. Very good at teaching us how to ride these exciting "vehicles" as well as showing us around as our guide. You wouldn't believe how much fun these things are. It's a bit of an odd sensation to ride them -- but just a few minutes into it, and you are ready to go! Basically, you lean forward to go and lean back to stop. Simple.   And if you stay on the trails or sidewalks, you'll be fine. We had a couple of spills in our group, but those were from people who were "hot dogging" around on the things.  Every now and then, Groupon or Living Social offer a great price on a Segway tour. Make sure you use the company that starts out at the JW Marriott resort -- it's a beautiful location, safe sidewalks and you take a nice break at a great coffee shop halfway into your tour.

Cool old hotel, interesting ghost stories. But everything else is just so-so. Stopped in at Happy Hour and overpaid for a couple of drinks. The place was seriously dead as a doornail at 5:45 PM on a Friday afternoon. That says something about the community reception to the Ghost Lounge.   Don't order drinks with tonic. Something is wrong with their dispenser -- waitress was nice enough to replace it however. Overall, I was not very impressed and won't be back.

My partner and I went on a Living Social coupon, and we really enjoyed it. She had the Fish Tacos and I had the Chicken Tacos.  Both of us felt that the salsa on the table was too spicy. With so many reviews here and other places about the "too hot" salsa, you'd think they'd cut it back a bit. Anyway, that was the only thing we didn't like. The homemade chips were fantastic.  The service was on the ball and the food was fresh. As an aside,I don't know why they opened at Esplanade. Management there is supposed to be terrible and there are rumors that the theater will be closing. Houstons has already moved out, Pizza Picazzo closed. But Fuego Tacos is a great addition to the neighborhood. Let's hope that this merchant and others who remain at Esplanade can convince management to take care of the evil smells coming out of the septic and fix the elevators when they break every week. This restaurant deserves a community that will support and nourish it. Good job Fuego Tacos.

I love Filmbar. What could be better than watching an indie film with a good, cold beer in a place where only people with similar interests hang out? The front section of the place, when you walk in, is a small bar with a good selection of bottled beers and wine. (Man, I sure wish they had draft beers -- perhaps get an exclusive on Sedona's Oak Creek Brewing Co. brews). The owner is very friendly and easy to talk to. The other patrons are as well, and love talking about movies and such. Inside a bit further, there's a lounge area that has a good atmosphere, a bunch of bean bag chairs to sit on, and it almost begs for a hookah option. Inside the theater, you have a screen about the size of the smaller ones at a Harkins, but that's OK because you can sit up close and the room only holds about 40 people or so. We saw a good documentary the first time we were there, and now I want to go back and see 13 Assassins. I'll trust this guy to bring in some good stuff to Phoenix. Highly recommended spot! [Edit: After viewing 13 Assassins, we found that the music from the bar was very audible and distracting during quiet parts of this excellent film -- what a shame.]

This yogurt shop has the nerve to charge about 12% more per ounce than any other shop in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Know how other shops put a sign up by the front that says what the price-per-ounce is? (Generally, 37-39¢) -- well this business actually AVOIDS telling you their price. This guy seems to think that his flavors are worth you paying an extra $ or $$ every time you buy. Stay clear of this operation and go for your yogurt in any other location where prices are normalized. Don't let independent operators like this drive up your average price of tasty treats.

This company should be called "Physician's Assistant Express." I don't know what level of training it takes to become a PA, but this operation is NOT managed by Doctors. This is a place run by a guy who is an "assistant" level only. When they call you into the room to be seen, they say "The provider will see you now" instead of "The Doctor will see you now." I don't know how this place could have a high yelp rating when the service and the level of competence is so low. I went in and there were about 3-4 people ahead of me -- not bad, actually -- so I was happy with the wait time. But I had a couple of things that I wanted to talk to the "doctor" about and I was told that I had to "pick one, as the provider will only be able to talk to you about one of the issues at any one appointment."   So -- don't have a broken arm and then ask them about your fever as well. They can't help you. In my visit, I had the "provider" visit with me for no more than three minutes. Literally, he took a 3 minute review of my situation, and then I had the lowest level healthcare workers you can find doing the rest of the work. They needed help getting an old bandage off a wound and couldn't take it off themselves -- one was a trainee, and the other was clearly not all that experienced either. Overall, I felt that my modest co-payment of $50 was WAY too expensive for the poor healthcare that I received here at the "Physician Assistant Express."

We went out last night to the movies, and with an hour and a half to spare, we thought we had time to stop at this newish restaurant on the corner of Indian School and 24th St. It was a family owned place, baby in bassinet by the cashier, and absolutely no explanations of what the food is. Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadn't come and we'd never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie. So, disappointed, we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on Amazon. When I dove into the "to go" boxes, I stopped complaining. Man, that food was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka, only because I pretty much knew what it would be, and it far beat my expectations. Our Chicken Kabab (ordered again because we knew what it would be) was delicious as well. To the owners, thank you for being here. We'll be back. Please develop something that describes the food, and make a non-egg version of the Naan bread please! Lots of vegans and allergies out there who don't expect food from  your region to have heavy eggs included. Readers, as long as you set your expectations correctly about time for food preparation, you'll be very happy with Khyber Halal. Get in there and support this neighborhood gem!

We were in Sky Harbor going out of town for a few days, with a fair degree of hunger. I saw the "Sauce" sign and have had good experiences with them in their Scottsdale location. This is really good airport food . . . It's just remarkable to find such a nice, sit-down pizza joint in an airport. The slice of thick, Chicago style pizza I grabbed on my way out was TERRIFIC, juicy, thick and full of meat. My wife had a chicken salad that she still thinks about days later . . . the chicken was wonderful, flavorful and about 180 degrees from the usual boxed salads available near an airport gate. We met the manager there, Heather, who came around to ask about our experience and she was delightful as well. All in all, this is a very solid addition to the airport and we're very pleased to know about it.

This is one of those companies that specializes in service via "annual contracts." Get your wallet out . . . dealing with Empire is extremely pricey.  We made the mistake of calling Empire when our air conditioner broke. Being new to the area, we didn't have any local contacts and just used the yellow pages. When the Empire guys came, they found out what was wrong and replaced a small part that I later found was something like $60 or $70 when ordered on the Internet. But for some reason, by the time they added their service fee for the appx 20  minute appointment, it was considerably over $600. Then, they try to get you to buy an annual contract so that you can get two "free" tuneups. All in all, I wouldn't trust these people to come back to my house EVER. They give me a creepy feeling just talking to them on the phone.

This is my favorite place in the world. I'm talking about the best -- seriously, the very best -- enchiladas you will ever eat. Made just the way you like them. Smothered in good stuff, like wonderful pickled onions and some great cheeses. All of it is lip smacking good. And the idea for the place, the "make your own" kind of deal stolen from Subway, this is just really creative. Good job, congratulations to the owner. Someday I am going to stand out front with a big sign that says "You will love this food. Try it" because I think someone has to let the world know about the magnificence of Gadzooks. Read my reviews. I'm a very critical restaurant reviewer. I do not put up with slackers. This place rocks. [To the owner, my only suggestion is to put the "ear lady" in the back and not up front -- you'll attract more business.]

We love St. Francis. We're regulars there, and when we heard about the new place, we went to give it a try. We liked the vibe and the location is fine for us -- we're about five minutes away. Should be a popular place on First Fridays! Nice menu, free seltzer water on tap, and you pay up front and they bring your meal to the table. It's a good start.   But there were a few things wrong, at least in our first attempt. I'll go back, because I know this place is still working out the kinks. First off, I'm allergic to eggs, and I told them that at the order counter (but admittedly, the conversation was more about the mayonnaise in the coleslaw). They served my pulled pork with an egg bun, unfortunately. The sandwich is about $10, so it's pricey to have as the only thing on the plate. Should be fries with it at that price.  One of us got a great looking baked sweet potato that really was consumed quickly. Another person ordered a salad, and it came with a whole lot of ingredients that weren't listed in the menu. It had to go back a couple of times -- they really need to either make it the way it is listed on the menu, or advise those who order that it has a few "bonus items" included ("The Chino," $10.50).   The atmosphere is nice and the management is, like St. Francis, very accommodating. I can't give this particular $40 investment anything more than two stars, but I'll be back because I like their potential and the owners were so successful elsewhere that they ought to be able to fix these issues. (And to St. Francis folks, please, please, please . . . Don't put eggs in your buns, or at least offer an alternative, because you do this at both restaurants. Good fresh bakery items don't have to have eggs.)

Here's an unusual review for Zara. We've been going to Zara stores for years - up in Scandinavia, across Europe including Spain, last month in Singapore and Hong Kong, and so forth. I say it's a bit unusual because we've always "talked up" Zara with friends wherever we go, and now I'm posting a one-star review. It's almost like this Scottsdale Fashion Mall store is not related to the rest of the Zara universe -- that's how different it is. Not only in the selection of clothes (not as trendy, not as cool). But especially, I mean really dramatically, different in the level of customer service. You'll see other one and two star reviews on this site before mine that attest to the same thing. This is just a "Who gives a ***" operation. They literally could care less that they lost a customer with our family who must have previously spent $2,000 to $3,000 in their stores. And all this for a $41 return of a Christmas present.   Know the store policies carefully before you buy. This is a slippery place, where salespeople, register clerks and "managers" know that their policies create frustration for customers, and they actually appear to take enjoyment out of causing you grief. Here's a case in point . . . My son (our biggest Zara advocate) lives in LA and he bought me a pair of Jeans in the Scottsdale store when he was home for the holiday. Just a few days before Christmas. Well, they didn't fit, so I took the present back untouched (all tags, etc) with my son's original receipt for a refund. Either cash for me or a refund to my son's card would have been fine. But -- when you buy at Zara, you can't just do something so seemingly normal. Instead, you have to have the actual card it was purchased on for the credit (it's a "theft thing" according to management). My wife left the store frustrated and I went back, after getting a text message photo of both the front and the back of his credit card (same last name, same bank and card as my own). I showed the picture of card and my original receipt to them as well, and all they will offer is a credit in their store. "No refunds for Christmas presents" blah blah.  For a $41 sale, this company and their uncaring management loses a family that had been religiously touting them for years. Now I know why good retail sales managers are so important. You can't put a clerk into a manager's job and expect them to understand that sometimes you have to make exceptions. We'll never be back to Zara and I urge you to reconsider if you are thinking of going to the store yourself.

Very poor quality food and drink . . . There at happy hour, and glasses tasted like soap. Don't order a White Sangria, as it is made with 80% sweet and sour mix from their margarita machine. Really disappointing.  The Quesadillas saved the day. They have a lot of cheese and a pleasant taste. But the Carnitas taco was the worst I've had -- just nasty. And the chips were greasy and right out of the fryer.   Very surprised. Sam Fox ought to do better. This was a relatively low-cost startup from Fox Restaurant Concepts in a location that has had other belly-up operations. This one is headed same direction, unfortunately. Love his "Wild Child" right up the street, however.

We live in the area and have an easy walk to Mejico. I wanted to follow an earlier reviewer's advice about a great happy hour (Christine) but unfortunately we were extremely disappointed. We arrived on a Friday afternoon about 4 PM, on a night when Bink's across the street was closed for a private party. Mejico looked nice, we liked the vibe. But man, this is not a Happy Hour. This is a Sad Hour. What's so special about really, really miniature street tacos or a $3 cheese quesadilla that is so small it is literally only three small bites? Happy Hour is, for us, a time to experience a new place -- to get a feel for the ambiance, the menu items and so forth. For example, go to Happy Hour at Beckett's Table and you get a feel for their menu and their flavors. At Mejico, they take a tiny 6" flour tortilla, put a tiny amount of cheese in it and roll it over. It was a ripoff, and I don't say that lightly because anything you get for $3 has got to be small (so assume this is REALLY small). The special happy hour margarita was just a much smaller version of their real margarita, and so forth. Basically, we'll never go back and the owner lost out on the opportunity to get a new set of regulars. All you have to do is treat happy hour as if it is special -- and give a warm welcome. In this case, the smell of pot wafting into the front of the house from the kitchen and the glazed look on the two waiters faces was a bit much. When one of them asked how we enjoyed the food and we told them what a bad value it was, he simply smiled and walked away. This place is s short-timer, and thats a shame because mid-town is a potentially cool area and the owner spent some money on the inside.

We had a wonderful night here on my son's birthday. What made it so special was the great service that we had out of our waiter. Even though we were in a remote far-off corner of his outdoor patio on a chilly evening, he kept his eyes on us and we were never left wanting. [They have great heaters and they aren't afraid to use them.] The atmosphere is not as cool or charming as it could be -- I wish they'd spent a bit more to make the place look good. But, I did like the food, and that's what counts. I had a huge piece of pork tenderloin, and some great Mac 'n Cheese. While nothing is especially unique, their comfort food does just that . . . it gives you the feeling that someone who loves you just cooked you a home-cooked meal. I don't get that feeling in a restaurant very often. The next night we had dinner in another famous Phoenix restaurant (Tarbell's) and it was a let-down compared to this. When the waiter heard me reference my son's birthday, he brought out a large desert item which was enjoyed by all. A great experience! We were there on Arizona Wines night, and enjoyed a great bottle of Cochise Country white wine for half off. I like promotions like that.
