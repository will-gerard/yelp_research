I've had the pleasure of having Sunfare deliver food to my home for over a year now and they deserve a write up.  When I first started Sunfare I thought I'd give it a try for a month because of the cost.  I wanted to know there was value to what I was paying for.  Before Sunfare I ate out a lot and ordered a lot of fast food.  I did it out of convenience so I thought Sunfare would be a good idea because it was even more convenient.  I soon realize that Sunfare was more than just convenient.  It was also healthy and delicious.  More so than most places I've eaten before.  My wife and I don't cook and when we went grocery shopping we'd end up wasting most of the grocery items because we never got around to cooking it and end up wasting a ton of money by throwing food in the garbage.  With Sunfare we never have to worry about throwing away wasted food.  So is Sunfare a good value?  Yes, it is!  No more wasted food and no more going shopping for food and no more spending time in the kitchen making inedible meals.  Sunfare is a great value if you take all these things I mentioned in consideration.  Oh and besides that my wife and I have lost weight eating these low fat meals they put together.  I highly recommend them.

Went here for restaurant week because we're cheap and don't like to pay full price and very glad we did.  I must be getting old because there was soft music in the background and even though the restaurant was busy it was relatively quiet and I liked it that way.  My wife and I were probably the youngest patrons in the restaurant by at least 20 years.  The food was awesome.  I ordered the filet rare and it actually came out rare.  It's the easiest way to cook steak but you'd be surprised how many other places mess that up.  I like this place better than City Hall but less than Shula's.  I'd come here again if I were trying to impress some out-of-towners visiting me... if my out-of-towners were over 50 years old.

Can't say enough great things about Brian and his company.  You don't meet a lot of people who are passionate about their work but Brian is.  I found Bradley Carpet Cleaning on yelp and after reading the reviews I figure why not?  If it didn't work out I can always go down the list of cleaners should this company not do a good job but Brian exceeded my expectations.  In AZ you don't find a lot of companies that give great service.  They all seem to just give OK service.  Brian is the exception.  I hope he never retires.

Another great Yelp find!  We've owned our home for about 3 years and getting the garage floors done has always been on the "to do" list.  We got a total of 4 bids from flyers in the mail to friend's recommendations and we also tried getting a bid from the guys who originally put in the custom cabinets in our garage when the house was built.  We weren't impressed with any of sales people that came to our house to bid for the job especially when I told them I'm getting other bids.  I finally yelp a flooring company and IronDrive were the only ones that had multiple good reviews.  Shane came over and he was very professional even when I told him about the other bids.  All 4 bids came in competitive with each other but what made us pull the trigger with Shane is how fast he can get a job done because of the prepping process.  All the other companies said it was a 2 day process plus we're not able to drive on the floors for 7 days.  With IronDrive's process and product they were done in 5 hours and we were able to drive on it after 48 hours.  It's been 2 weeks since our flooring was done and I couldn't be more happy.  Shane was very accommodating, polite, and most importantly professional.  Oh and they're the only one with a lifetime warranty.  Can't go wrong with these guys.

Calling Rice Paper a Vietnamese restaurant is like calling Panda Express a Chinese Restaurant. Enough said.

Fast and great service. They worked with my insurance company to get things done the next day. I thought it was going to be a hassle to replace my windshield because I would have to bring it into their shop but they sent a mobile unit out to my house and fixed it here which made it so convenient.  The whole process was enjoyable...well besides the rock hitting my windshield. I'd highly recommend them.

You know you're going to have a sad sub when you see 2 microwaves behind the counter but I wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt. Wrong move.  Worse soggy sub I've ever eaten and I've eaten lots of subs. Tables and floors were dirty and I was the only one here. There were 3 teenage girls working and they can care less about customer service.  They represent how the owner conducts business and I predict they won't be here too much longer.

There's something to be said about having an insurance agent who works closely with their client than one of the major companies that promise a discount and really doesn't explain what's in the policy you're paying for.  Charlotte and Steve took the time to explain to me the exactly what was covered so I knew I wasn't paying for over coverage.

My wife and I have been going to Will's before he opened up his own gym and we think he should have opened one up a long time ago.  He truly cares about his clients and seeing us succeed.  My wife and I have seen tremendous change in our bodies and we couldn't imagine doing it without him.  He has a higher standard for our well being and he knows how to push us and have fun at the same time.  He and his business partner opened up this gym and designed it with equipment and group sessions that are fun and effective.  I love how clean and "boutiquie" the workout environment is.  It makes training there even more enjoyable.

I was really skeptical about this place because of the reviews here.  All the 5 stars were written by 1 or 2 reviewers while the elites had not so good things to say about it so I went into lunch here thinking it was going to blow like a lot of new Vietnamese places popping up in white rural neighborhoods.    My first impression was it was clean.  Too clean.  Wasn't used to my peoples keeping a clean establishment.  There was soft music playing in the background, the full bar looked organized, the servers were smiling.  Totally not a traditional Vietnamese joint.  There was a freakin wine list!  Way too bougie for me.  No wine I know of pairs well with a bowl of rare beef pho.    I ordered the spring roll and chicken banh mi.  My sister ordered the special pho.  The spring rolls were OK.  Wasn't anything special.  You can tell they were prepared earlier because the rice paper wasn't as tacky as if they were prepared on the spot.  When the entrees came and I bit into my sandwich I was shocked on how good it was.  I haven't had a good sandwich like that in a long time.  All the banh mi places here are crap.  The bread wasn't over cooked, the chicken was moist, and there's plenty of pickled veggies.  I could have used a little more cilantro.  I tried my sister's pho and the broth was solid.  The vermicelli was good and she got a lot of meat.    Overall it was a good experience.  The service was excellent, food was good, and the staff said bye as we left.  I know that's corny to mention but again, my peoples don't do that.  I'd come back and if I get a different experience I'll definitely let you yelpers know.

This is one of those pretty places with ok food at best. Service was nice and food came pretty quickly but I was the only one in the restaurant. 8pm wed night. I ordered the ramen and one of the baos. Ramen was small for what you paid for and the flavor just ok on the salty side. The chicken seemed dry and presentation wasn't great.  The Mahi bao was dry too. Ok flavor but not enough for me to want to order it again. Really wanted this place to be good and maybe when they're established they'll tweak their menu to improve their food. I won't come back until they're at least 4 stars.

I really wanted to like this place because I'm always in the area of their brick and mortar location. The menu and concept works a lot better for a food truck but they're going to have to step up their game if they want the restaurant to be successful.  There's only 8 items on their menu and you pick up your food at the food window.  I understand they're trying to keep overhead cost down with picking up your own food but $10 for a mediocre small bowl of pho is a little excessive.  Didn't think there was value in my meal and that's what it takes when I consider another trip back.
