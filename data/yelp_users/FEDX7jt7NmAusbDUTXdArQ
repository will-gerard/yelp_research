On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.  Fairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..  My company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.  To Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.  To New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.  I don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.

I liked our meal at La Fonda Del Sol.  Two kinds of salsa, fresh chips, and really good food.  For comparison, I got the Flamingo Dinner and my wife got the Shredded Beef Chimichanga.  The difference is rice and beans, and even though the rice and beans were good, I don't think it was worth the extra money.  Does this mean that the full plate should be cheaper or the chimi should be $1 more?  I don't know, I guess it depends what the competition is charging.  Although the food was good and the service was friendly, we got there around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night and the place needed a really good cleaning.  I was kicking plastic drink lids and other refuse that was under my table, so I think the place needs to be swept a bit more frequently.  I was also a little surprised at how quiet it was in there because some other businesses seemed to be busier.  But that's okay, we had a good meal and I would go back if I lived in the area.

We did what Teri did, we stopped here for supplies before heading north.  The store was empty, the prices were okay, and the people working there were all happy and friendlier than I expected.  Loved it.  I have no idea how they are with prescriptions though, we were tourists just passing thru.

LVCC is your typical big city convention center and two of us were there for Lightfair 2012.  We had several meals inside and they were tolerable.  Getting to/from the place isn't hard but I wish the monorail went into the building.

I stayed at New York - New York and went to a trade show at the convention center.  It was 100 degrees out and the monorail was nicer than walking and cheaper than a taxi.  But if you're staying anywhere near the MGM, NY-NY, Excalibur, etc., you have to wander through the maze that is the MGM Grand to get to the monorail station.  And when you get to the convention center, it's still a hike to the convention center's north halls.  I like the monorail, but I wish they had made it a little more convenient.  And if you're trying to get down to Mandalay Bay or Luxor, you're out of luck because the MGM is as far south as it goes.  It went where I needed to go and the A/C was working so I'm a fan.  But they could have done so much better.

My meal at Chin Chin was better than I expected.  The menu is full of the food that you'd find in any local Americanized Chinese take out place along with various other Asian foods like Sushi and Pad Thai.  I didn't see any Pho or Bulgogi and I was almost expecting them.  I hadn't eaten all day and because the underwhelming size of a previous meal at the nearby Gonzales y Gonzales, I may have ordered too much.  I got a Spicy Rainbow Roll and the Peanut Noodles.  They were both good, larger than I expected, and not under-spiced. Even better, I didn't wake up thirsty in the middle of the night because of too much salt or MSG.  I would have liked to see more sushi and sashimi options, but to complain about it at a Chinese restaurant seems weird.  I would have also have liked to try something that I couldn't get at home and sadly, the Peanut Noodles were about as close as I could get.

Me and NY-NY, I don't know.  It just wasn't as smooth as it should have been or as smooth as pretty much anyplace else I've stayed in Vegas.  The keys stopped working because they didn't program them correctly.  The wifi's download speed ranged from 0.14 to 0.36 mbps, which is sort of useless.  The cable TV went out one night and they blamed the cable company for that.  The alarm clock was so weird that I had to download the manual to learn how to set the alarm.  After 3PM no one works in the business center but when you call, a message says someone will call you back even though no one is there.  And the room could have been cleaner.  There were empty shampoo bottles in the bathroom and garbage behind the nightstand.  The good news is that there were no bedbugs.  I'll stay somewhere else next time.

Il Fornaio in New York, New York was the highlight of my budget business trip to Las Vegas.  As always, if I make a little money when I'm there, I give it back to them in the restaurants instead of at the tables.  The money I made on this trip was just enough to move our dinner plans up to Il Fornaio and it was really nice.  Okay, it's not Boston's North End or what's left of NYC's Little Italy, but the food was really tasty, service couldn't have been better, we even had dessert, and the people watching was the best.  If you like it quiet, eat inside.

We had some perfectly cooked burgers in a surprisingly quiet restaurant in Mandalay Bay.  Service was really good, food was exactly what we expected, and there are a variety of drink and food specials.  The onion rings were an exception, being far better than I had anticipated.  It's a good place for two people to have burgers and drinks, and still get change from a $100 bill.

I grew up in the burbs of New York and have a decent understanding of New York style pizza.  I had a slice of the four cheese pizza at Sirrico's and it was pretty good.  The crust was a little bland and undercooked, but the thickness and taste had more of a New York quality than the stuff that I find at home in New England.  A slice was $5, but the slice was larger than average and was best consumed when folded in half.  They also had sicilian pizza, which is sort of an unknown in most of the country.  I would have liked to try that too, but I just needed a snack and one slice was enough for me.

I had a fine meal at Nine Fine Irishmen but really, it wasn't all about the food.  The fish and chips were okay but I've had much better fish and I found myself wondering if the fish was delivered to the restaurant pre-battered and frozen.  I don't really know but it didn't have the taste of a really fresh piece of cod.  The good news is, that's the worst thing I can say because I left happy.  The fries were good, the malt vinegar was fresh, and the draft Harp lager was delicious.  The atmosphere was really nice and I was in an area that seemed to be a collection of small dining rooms, complete with lost patrons wandering through.  The highlight was the waitress, who seemed to be one of the most sincerely pleasant people I encountered during my stay in Las Vegas.  She had short blond hair and I think her name was Samantha, but I'm not sure.  I'd go back to Nine Fine Irishmen without hesitation.  I don't know that I'd get the Fish and Chips next time, but I'd definitely go back.

"The Callie" is a large, old, beautiful hotel in Edinburgh at the base of the extinct volcano that is the home of Edinburgh Castle.  Or so they tell me.  The hotel is an old building and the rooms are absolutely not all the same.  We ate breakfast at the hotel a few times and it was amazing.  Haggis, black pudding, white pudding... it was all here.  The only problem with this hotel is that it's expensive.  But if it's you've never stayed at the Caledonian before, be sure to do it at least once.

It was in this store that I discovered Wolfstone and their "Not Enough Shouting" CD.  I enjoyed listening to this CD so much that I came back to Scotland with my wife to see them in concert.  For this selfish reason, I give this store four stars.  Assume that the karma is good here and you'll discover music that you would not find anywhere else.  I don't know if this is true and it will be up to future reviewers to decide.  All I can say is that for me, the store was magic.

An excellent castle.  We wandered around the castle for hours and had an amazing time.  We were surprised when they shot a cannon at 1PM, and apparently they do that every day.  We went back the next day to discover that there was an admission fee.  I don't know how we missed that the day before.  Oops.  If you've never seen a real castle, this is the place to lose your castle virginity.

We ate at Mijana on our last night in Phoenix and it was a great way to end our trip.  The food came out quickly, portions were generous, and I had an Almaza beer for the first time in a really long time.  The only problem was that my fork and knife needed to be wiped down and the glass that came with the beer wasn't clean.  I'm guessing the dishwasher isn't working right and I hope they fix it soon.  The ambiance is really interesting, the space is very industrial and edgy with the unfinished ceiling and color changing lights scattered around the room.  Thinking back on it, it was pretty cool.  I'd definitely come back here and I could see Mijana becoming a regular part of a "last night in Phoenix/Tempe" ritual, especially if they get the dishwasher working better.

Hussong's was better than I had expected from a Mexican place in the tourist-laden shopping mall that connects Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  It's hard to go wrong with a pitcher of Negra Modelo, and after flying all day if wasn't too hard to impress me or my co-worker who were in town for a conference.  We weren't pushing the culinary envelope or searching for the "real" Mexico among mall restaurants, and we were happy with the tacos and flautas that we ordered.  The good news:  It's loud and artificial, but it's fun.  The bad news:  The two salsas that came with the chips were both horrible, and lack of drink prices on the menu is a trap for the unwary.  Pitchers of Sangria were $40, but our pitcher of really good beer was a much more reasonable $22.  I'd go back on a future trip because it's perfect after a day of flying when you just want to eat and crash.

This is an amazing hotel at the base of the extinct volcano that is the home of Edinburgh Castle.  The rooms are all unique and I didn't see or taste anything that wasn't incredible.  The only problem with The Callie (the taxi drivers all seemed to call it that) was the price, but that's to be expected especially now that it's a Waldorf Astoria so I can't penalize them for it.

This Hampton Inn is new and it was very nice.  Not fancy, but nice.  Parking was good, the hotel was pretty quiet despite being full, there are good restaurants nearby, and a 24 hr gas station is a block away.  We stayed here because we had an early flight out the next morning and it worked really well.  The only bad thing was that the coffee from the coffee maker in the room was undrinkable.  Being able to make coffee in the room is nice but only if you can drink the coffee.  They'll even pack a breakfast for you to take on the plane, but they throw a bottle of water in each sealed bag so we didn't make the TSA happy when we went thru security.  Oops.
