GREAT PIZZA! And nice staff! I had called barros to deliver a pizza and asked that the pepperonis be in a smiley face for the recipient. They said that they were too busy to do something like that so I called here. They said no problem! They're pizzas and slices alone and big!

Love this park! There is a small playground for smaller children and another playground for the older kids! There's also a basketball court and a large field of grass. My kid runs around the entire place and loves it!

The place is actually really beautiful! It's big and nicely decorated. The sushi was average. Their specialty rolls arent really special, it's just an average roll that is $13. Nothing to write home about. Small bowl of miso soup was $8 and the cucumber salad was just cut cucumber with pepper on it. I think the only good thing about the dinner was our server. His name is Adrian I believe. He was SO nice and very attentive. I enjoyed the beer and sake though....?
