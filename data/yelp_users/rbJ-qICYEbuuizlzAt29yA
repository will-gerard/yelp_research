Our absolute favorite place. Great miso soup.   It's actually not quite as good as it used to be before a few important chef changes. But still a 5 since there's been a thread of continuity through the changes.  Try: the baked scallops on top of the California roll  Try: the sunomono (plain or with crab)  Try: the Tamago nigiri (I like it with a little eel sauce on it as dessert)  Nice staff. Fun regulars. Large pieces of what's usually small at other places.

Each time I put my trust in Bell Union it pays off. From big jobs like replacing motor mounts to them fixing my burned out tail light without any delay or even a fee, they make me feel cared for and well taken care of.   And the loaner car makes me feel like family!

Top notch. Would probably be our favorite place i we lived closer.   Creative, fresh food. Some serious fresh wasabi.  The owner/chef is a true salt-of-the-earth wonderful guy. He's a delightful and engaging person.   I had my first ever handroll here, as a free gift from the chef. It was on off-menu creation that has become a favorite I can order anywhere I travel.   Sushi Kee regularly has varieties of fish that I don't normally find in restaurants, and they are knowledgeable about them. The specials are not the same thing over and over, and seem to offer a good value.  Truly an exemplary restaurant.

My suggestion: spend 3 or 4 quiet minutes looking around before you order. You can stand in one place. Notice the floor, the decorations, the fake plants, the ceiling. Take it all in. THEN decide if this is a place you want to eat food from. I should have taken the hint when I walked in and there were no other customers there on a Saturday during the noon hour. Unfortunately I was dead set on supporting a local rather than chain establishment that day. And with no one to slow me down, I ordered right away. Only after ordering did I take in the grimy scene. The place is disturbingly unclean looking.  The gyro was large but plain and average in flavor - a bit too greasy. Fries were overcooked, hardly any salt, and old tasting.   The service was uninspired and actually slow despite no other customers being there. It seemed like we were a bother.  My two boys were okay later, but I had some intestinal distress during the window of time that would point to this meal.  I won't be back.

The only thing louder than the deep cuts of Arcade Fire blaring and the bad paintings on the walls is the screech of the metal chairs scraping across the concrete floor.   Too loud for anything but takeout. Though the staff may be friendly, the place is virtually as inhospitable as an actual jungle.

At least one a week. Can't go wrong.   My family's favorite chips & hot sauce anywhere.  Wife loves the veggie burro.

I called Bryan Ray yesterday evening after my van's side window shattered in a freak accident. The phone staff got me taken care of and the installer (Jeremy) had a new factory window in my van by lunch the following day.   Can't ask for better than that!  Great product. Great service!

So great to see soft serve cones with a choice of dip flavors in a mobile truck. The chocolate dip has a nice slight coffee/mocha flavor.   And the gentleman operating the truck provided wonderful service. Truly a great addition to the valley's growing cadre of fine food cart trucks.  Kudos, Mister Softee!

As a professional photographer, I know all too well how important a top notch event planner is to the success of a great wedding. Last month I was lucky/blessed/uber-fortunate to be working at a wedding that was planned and coordinated by the team of real pros from Sip & Twirl.   Beyond being efficient and thorough, they are so personable that they are a joy to work with, even when they are being sure to keep vendors like me on schedule.   They are a joy to work with, and I am delighted every time I see that they are the planners I get to enjoy at a wedding. They make the life of all your other vendors SO much easier, so we can concentrate on our craft and creativity, rather than logistics. Sip & Twirl is the perfect first step in making your event become what you've always dreamed of. You'll love them!
