If it were not for the chips and salsa, I would never return to this restaurant. I have been going there since I was a kid. In the past year or so, the service has gotten so bad, I wouldn't even believe it is the same restaurant. I only get carry out now, and that is only when I am craving the chips and salsa.   Even their carry out food service is terrible, unfortunately. My past 4 visits, I have called over 30-45 minutes in advance to my order, and upon arrival nobody has prepared it. During one visit (The Friday before 2012 Superbowl), it took me 45 minutes AFTER I arrived for them to get me 2 bags of chips and 2 portions of salsa. Another woman had been waiting there longer than me. We were both waiting on chips and salsa ONLY. That should never happen.  My last visit was 3/3/12 and again, I called 35 minutes before arriving to order chips and salsa for a party. I walked in and waited 7 minutes before being greeted. The hostess then went to "find out" who took my order and returned and told me I had to go to the cantina/bar to pay and get them. Once I got in there, I stood for 15 minutes trying to get the attention of someone walking by so I could get my order. Finally a man brought it to me. I was so fed up. I do not think I can return. I am sick of being treated like they don't need or even WANT my business.  I have never received an apology from any of them for taking so long, and not having my order ready, even when I gave them plenty of notice AND the orders were simple.

Fastest service ever! I love getting breakfast here because I know it will never make me late! The employees are so friendly, too!  During once visit, I had been dieting for a while and decided to treat myself to some fries but they were less than warm. Any other time and I would have eaten them, but I had been craving them so bad!! They happily made me some fresh fries and chatted with me while I waited! It made my day ;)

I love that this location participates in the Restaurant.com deals! My husband and I get the $25 gift certificate for $2 and go every month or so. 9 out of 10 times the service is perfect! Every once in a while we catch them on a bad night, but the service the other times makes up for it! The employees are super friendly and kind. We tend to sit on the patio in the nice weather and have only once been forgotten by the waiter. That is a very good track record in my opinion, as we go there quite a bit!  The drink prices are amazing! My drinks always taste exactly as I am expecting, they are very consistent. They do not skimp on the alcohol, I love it.  I would recommend this location to anyone!

I bought a Groupon.com deal for this restaurant... I am so happy I did!  They had amazing food and it was super cheap! Get the green sauce, your life will be changed forever! :) Staff was very friendly and the food came out quick!  Churros are good here (most places churros are soggy or overcooked), they had the perfect crispyness to them!

First of all, I should say I go into a restaurant WANTING to love it. It is very hard to make me never want to return- I am a food lover!!  Early 2011. My husband and I received a gift card to this restaurant so we took my sister-in-law out. It ended up being embarrassingly bad, and we felt really bad for taking her here.  Our server was so rude! He was very unprofessional, and acted like he did not want to be there. I wish I could remember his name, but I did not bother to write it down. I recently turned 21, so was excited to try a new drink. I ordered a red apple martini and he brought me a green apple martini.  I do not like to send anything back, so I thought I would give it a try, and I ended up not liking it. I flagged him down and let him know that I had received the wrong drink. He said to me "are you sure?" and tried to convince me that I had ordered the green martini. It was very awkward, because I knew (and everyone at my table knew) that I had ordered the red martini. I asked if I could please just get the red one as the green one was not very good. He reluctantly took it away and then returned to our table several minutes later. In a quiet voice he said "Hey, if my manager asks, tell him you changed your mind, or I will get in trouble".  Overall, the experience was horrible. There were long gaps in time that our waiter was no where to be seen and at one point we had to get the attention of another waiter for water refills. A customer should never have to ask for a refill after their cup has been empty for 20 minutes. It was very rude. The food was nothing special, did not leave an impression.  We had planned to be there for an hour at the most, but from the moment we walked in to when we left, it was over 2 hours! The length of time of the meal should be dictated by the customer, not by bad service.  We felt very silly for having gone there. Most restaurants strive to give the customer an experience that they will want to return to. This restaurant did not give us that experience at all. Very unfortunate.

My husband started going to this restaurant over 4 years ago and I have been going for over 3 years. It is family owned and they always remember us, no matter how long it is between visits. It is so awesome to walk into a place and see faces that you remember. They are very attentive and service is quick!   They have a huge variety of crepes from sweet to savory. The Italian sodas are amazing and their hot chocolate is so fancy!   I recommend this place to everyone!

The employees at this location are AWESOME!  My husband and I have been going here for several years now and there are several employees that have been there as long. They know us by face and preference and always have an upbeat attitude. I have never enjoyed going to a grocery store before going to this one! They always put a smile on my face, even after a long day at work. We will be moving soon, and I am sad that this store will not be nearby anymore! I will have to stop by every once in a while to say hi to Sandy, Russel and Chris!  The produce is always fresh and maintained, and the store is neat and tidy. Great wine prices!

Arrived at 8:44 on January 23rd, close time was 9pm. The open sign in the window was turned off and lobby lights were turned off. There were 3 children in the lobby. A couple of them sleeping on the tables, the other sitting looking bored. They looked like they were waiting for something.   The door opened, though, but the woman inside said "we're closed!" I said, "I thought you closed at 9?" After gazing dramatically at the clock on the wall for a few moments, she looked at me and replied "I already cleaned the line" while indicating to the clean assembly area behind the counter. I asked "is the food still out? You don't close until 9, right?". She acted irritated and didn't say anything. I said "it's 8:45, and you close at 9, right?" She acted very annoyed and then said she would make me a sandwich. I said no it's okay, not with the way she was acting.   It was clear at that point the kids were hers, just waiting for her to get off of work. So annoyed! I have a kid to get home to, also! Ugh. Not coming back, I will go out of my way to the franchised Subway at Guadalupe & Alma School!

I visited The Grind on a Thursday a little before noon. We had no problem getting a table right away. The service was great, we were in and out on our own timeline, not theirs.   I ordered the "Grilled portobello sandwich / fried zucchini, ricotta salata, wild arugula / $10" and "Half and half fries / $5" (half sweet potato/hald herbed fries), and water. I was disappointed that fries do not come with the burgers, but I know that their product is supposed to be supreme, so it comes at an extra cost.  The burger was amazing! I have never had a better mushroom burger-it was somehow juicy! I would order it again in a heartbeat. The fries were good, the sweet potato fries were my favorite.  The servers were really nice and checked on us several times.   I will definitely return here in the future!

I came to this office before reading any reviews or researching it. I really lucked out with my experience! Upon arrival, Aimee gave me a full tour of the office. As small as that may sound, it made me feel like a valued patient already! It was very thoughtful of her to not whisk me into some room, but rather show me which rooms were for what purposes. After that, she went over a full review of injuries, pains and problems I have been having. I then met with Dr. Scharf, and he was so nice! Very easy-going and friendly! And he genuinely seems to love what he does! I plan to keep returning for treatments!

I have been seeing Dr. Novelly for over 10 years now and I love going to his office! The staff is always so nice! And when I say nice, I mean they are genuinely happy to be there! Dr. Novelly is always friendly and truly cares about my mouth being healthy!

The food here is like a worse version of Arby's. Waste of money!

I placed my order with this restaurant through eat24.com. 5:55pm: placed order for 2 salads, 1 baked mac n cheese, 1 Philly cheese steak, 1 personal pizza and 1 order garlic knots. Receive email from eat24.com immediately, it stated ETA of 30-45 mins. 6:35pm: Requested updated ETA for my food through eat24.com. They call the restaurant who states my food is ready and the driver is leaving right then. This restaurant is 5 minutes away. 7:14pm: I have requested another ETA for my food, restaurant has stated that their driver is 8-10 minutes away MAX. 7:50pm: My food is delivered without apology.  I had to stay 25 mins after my shift was over to wait for the food delivery.  I asked the driver if the delay was due to the website or the restaurant and he advised it was "deeeefinitelyk not the website's fault". I then asked if my meal would be comped or if there would be a discount/coupons?? He said "No. If I were the owner that might be a different story. But I'm not." I said okay, thanks, bye. He said "I'm just glad you are happy and not upset!"... UMM was he not there for that entire conversation??  On top of the food being 1.5 hrs late, the Philly cheese steak ended up being some type of chicken sandwich and none of the condiment sides that we requested were provided.  The sad thing is, I work in a department of 70 people who LOVE to order food to be delivered and who have never heard of this place. If I had a good experience, or even mediocre, word would have spread like wildfire about this place and they could have had many new customers.

Do not use the drive-thru at this location! They have messed up my order 5 out of 5 times I have used the drive up. They act like they don't care. My husbands sandwich toppings end up on mine, mine end up on his and we have never gotten a sandwich made correctly. Save yourself the annoyance of paying $7 for a sandwich just to get it wrong.
