I hate giving this place only one star, because I love the location and the history. The service was wonderful and the staff was friendly, however I just can't give a $130 dinner a good review when it was so lack luster, tame, bland and out right boring. Perhaps they are catering to an older crowd that has dietary restrictions on flavor and spice, but their menu is dated - makes me think they haven't revamped it in 15-30 years. Their oso bucco portion was tiny and slimy maybe only 3oz and the risotto was bland. Had some cold shrimp spring roll? appetizer that tasted like they scraped it off the bottom of an aquarium. We went on a Saturday night expecting it to be packed, should have known the food was terrible. Please redo your menu!

To locate bar: Enter passed the movie theater near the Walmart entrance (there's a traffic light for this turn), head directly back towards the Ice Rink and proceed to the left behind the rink building. Find the poorly lit dumpster and you found the bar. Best part: The back of the bar is a window into the Ice Rink, live LOCAL bands (they don't even let the bands play covers), great beer options, wood paneling, dive-y with a cozy feel. Wish it was closer to my house because I would be here all the time if so!

I am partial, my husband and I got married here last May and it was everything we could have wanted. Being from the northeast and him from the Midwest, we feel starved for green grass, deciduous trees and rustic, wooden fences. The Farm really delivers those wonderful feelings of reconnecting with nature and socializing in an outdoor setting that doesn't feature poured concrete flower beds and overly watered tropical plants.   For wedding reception/ceremony: We used Mike Kennedy, the nondenominational officiant The Farm recommended for our ceremony, he was excellent. The staff at the Farm as well as Santa Barbara Catering (You must use them to be married here) were outstanding! Our guests said it was the best food they have ever eaten at a wedding, which is a huge compliment. We choose the grove (under the white tent in the pecan grove) for our reception (they have a few other locations to pick from depending on location on the property) and our ceremony was under the large wooden, vine covered arbor - perfection! As wedding prices go, it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers, people missing trees, grass etc, great food, amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding (it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out there)  Food: there are three dining options at The Farm, Quiescence (fancy, high end dining) Morning Glory Cafe (breakfast/brunch), The Farm Kitchen - (lunch) I could write a novel here, but overall: the food is a little expensive (lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks) but it is very good, plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area. If it's busy prepare to wait awhile to order  and get your food (self serve, you gotta pick it up at the window when they call your number)   For breakfast/brunch at Morning Glory expect similar pricing, but this is located towards the back of the property in a cozy little brick patio area - simple waiter service.

I stumbled across this lil gem on my way to a different antique store and was pretty impressed.   It's your typical merchant booth set up, but it's a bit smaller than other malls so it's not so daunting to navigate. There is your usual booths o' junk, but I have seen some pretty fantastic items for sale here. If you are looking to browse some treasures, this is a great spot.

Went on a Saturday morning for brunch, we waited a bit to order and get our food, but it was so organized and the system they use for ordering (while you're in line, someone assigns you a table, after you order they escort you to your table and then bring you your food when it's ready) and food delivery is so smooth you don't sweat it. I ordered their specialty pizza slice (GREAT!) and my husband had an egg/breakfast meal, I tasted and it was delicious. Can't wait to come back.

I have been going to Strands since I was in high school and can't say enough great things about my favorite stylist Kandi. The whole staff is wonderful and friendly and while the salon is located in the heart of Scottsdale, you never feel judged or surrounded by snotty, holier than thou attitude. I have naturally thick and wavy hair (not easy to cut) and have been butchered many times from expensive, high end salons (TG anyone?). Anytime I stray, I always slap myself in the forehead and take my sorry mess of a mane back to Strands for Kandi to fix it. If someone is willing to drive 35 minutes for a hair cut with gas as much as it is, you know it's gotta be good!

My favorite antique mall in the Valley just happens to be five minutes from home, so I am a frequent browser. I have found some steals though and it always pays to check in regularly as stuff is always changing. This is one of the only antique malls I can say that you could actually stumble across JUST the thing you were looking for. The staff is wonderful and everything smells like Pittsburgh Willy's! Perfect place to go on a hot summer day.

One word: Autofry, another word: karaoke, two more words: wood paneling. 480 is an awesome dive bar with great characters, cheap drinks and friendly staff. Perfect when you want to slap on some jeans and a tshirt and not worry if you look good, just drink and have a great time.

Good ole fashion diner breakfast, brunch and lunch. In the days of Denny's, Applebees and the other chains, it's always nice to eat at a family establishment. Everything on the menu is good, can't go wrong. There is sometimes a wait - but the line moves quickly.

Love it here, after their big remodel the wait isn't as long. The eggs are always fluffy, the side of fruit always good. Coffee is dark/bold and always fresh. The fried potatoes are delish and if you are in the mood for comfort food classic, my fave grilled cheese and tomato soup is right here, and I don't even like tomato soup!

This review is for the Scottsdale Location, off Lincoln and Scottsdale Road.  If you are looking for designer finds, Scottsdale's location is the place to go. I live close to the Chandler store, however it seems like they get the picked over left overs from this store. As it always is with resale, thrift-like stores, it's hit or miss. Get your digging hat on and plan to hunt! There have been several times that I have been to this store and not found a single thing (which always sucks since it's 25 miles from my house!).   My trip this weekend was decent. Walked away with an awesome pair of Rich and Skinny jeans - retail, $170, paid $17, a tailored blazer, $19 (perfect for fall) and a emerald green tunic for $10. The jeans selection seems the best in sizes 25-28 then starts to peter out as you get to 30+. Those Scottsdale B's are tiny. Handbags range from SUPER high end Louis Vuittons and Gucci, down to vintage Dooney and Burke.   Because this location is so much bigger they do have a better assortment of the nicer designer clothing, shoes, purses, etc. However, I still love the store in Chandler because the prices are better and they tend towards better discounts and sales. But if you are looking for the best, this is the location to try.

This place is amazing! I have lived in the valley for over 13 years and have never heard of Cosanti before, but am so glad I was able to visit. In case you were wondering, Cosanti is the residence and sculpture studios of Paolo Soleri and his staff. According to their website, "Cosanti presents a unique bio-climatic architectural environment. Its structures feature many imaginative design elements, reflecting Soleri's innovative construction techniques." This location is also an Arizona Historic Site.  Cosanti is a working studio producing beautiful and unique bronze and ceramic Windbells. The bells range in price, however the small models are less than $35 and are AWESOME gifts. If you call ahead you can be sure you don't miss the bronze Windbells being poured, which was fascinating.   Cosanti is perfect for anyone who loves art, architecture, natural landscapes, modern  and progressive movements and different and adventurous things to do.

Love Rogue for their ever changing list of great LIVE MUSIC. The staff and owner are always friendly and the atmosphere is dive-casual-hipster. So leave your prissy outfit at home Scottsdale. Parking can be a pain, don't block a house's driveway, they will tow you! I recommend arriving early, if you are planning on watching a specific band. BRING CASH!

Having grown up in the northeast I was constantly dragged antiquing as a child but (thank you Dad) that continues to this day. I love having the luxury of AC in AZ and all the antiques in one place makes for super convenient browsing. Always great variety, fun junk to look through and the occasional find! Some booths are more expensive than others and some stuff is over priced but that is common with antique malls and it is Scottsdale. Still miss those little New England junk shops and barns filled with treasures though.

I love SAIL INN! Getting past the $8-10 cover on weekends is the hard part, but usually Sail delivers, 1) AMAZING LOCAL BANDS, 2) Laid back hippie, hipster,arty, folk vibe 2) cheap drinks, LOVE the little pitchers of beer - budlite for $4.25 on certain nights. Phoenix has a pretty lame music scene, but at least at Sail Inn you can always find decent live music and a fun crowd.

I am salivating as I think about Sacks - sits on ASU campus - off Mill and the visitor parking lot behind COOR. During the semester it is PACKED for lunch. But they are pretty good about moving through the line. The sandwich options are many, the quality of ingredients is excellent and you get a cookie with every 'wich.   There's a Subway across the street, but if you are in the mood for a REAL sandwich with exceptional quality this is your place. I recommend the Veggie - one of the best versions of this I have ever had. (Average sandwich, plus drink and side will run $9-12)

Break out the antiacids - well worth the splurge of calories and disaster it will wreck on your tummy and diet. I don't think you can make a bad choice off the menu - they have mac and cheese on a hot dog for Pete's Sake! The bun - ah yes, the bun, smothered in butter then grilled. (Vegan's faint!) The perfect hang over food - sits on ASU campus off Forest Mall on the western side of Hayden Library. Even Dr. Crow loves it, so the rumor goes. You will definitely want a nap, Tums or lettuce after this, but it's sooooo worth it.

Oh Dear Lord, this place scares me. I think Fat's is the perfect place for a bar crawl for a 21st, tourists who don't know any better, bachelorette party nightmare, or a themed night out where everyone pretends its 1990s and that daiquiris are still a cool drink. The few times I have been unwittingly dragged here, the service was always good, the drinks were strong and the food was blah. I just can't get over the slushie machines at the bar (there's something so wrong about that, when were they last cleaned!) and the boob beads everywhere. Maybe on Bourbon Street, but not here, I think I'll be going else where.

I have been here a few times and had a great experience every time. The food is wonderful (creative, fancy yet totally edible), the ambiance is cozy, sophisticated and classy, and the service is spot on. The cheese plate is delicious and their happy hour is fantastic. It's pricey, but if you're looking for a classy date night or even a pretty location for lunch off Mill ave, this is your place!

Not sure what to do with those clothes that are still in style or want to get a nice designer shirt that's only been worn once for 95% off? Some tips, they use their magic tag code reading skills to determine how current an article of clothing is, how sellable it is, if it's vintage is it still trendy or will a hipster buy it? etc... just like if you were selling a used car, you want to make sure the items are clean (duh), pressed, or dry cleaned prior to selling so they look more desirable. Each buyer is a little different, so if you think something of yours is good, but one buyer didn't buy it from you, try again later with someone else. If you go on a weekend to sell, try not to get there right at open because everyone else has the same idea when selling their stuff. Be prepared to wait. They won't buy Jeans with rips usually, even if they are designed that way (not sure why since isn't that the current style?).    I love taking store credit or if you want take the cash! I have seen some GREAT bargains - a Tory Burch embroidered tunic for $15, designer leather purse with awesome hardware, $30 etc.. It's hit or miss if you are shopping, but half the fun's in the hunt!

Tempe pub staple, as the Phoenix area goes, Casey Moore's is pretty good. The atmosphere is hipster, arty - but you won't be judged when you go. The patio is great during nice weather and the food is good enough. The wait staff always has a bit of a "holier than thou" attitude, but it won't distract from the overall experience. I met my husband here, so it holds a special place in my heart!

I so wish this was in the East Valley, but my gut is probably better off for it. I grew up in NY, and cravings for butter cookies in white boxes tied with peppermint sting can go unfulfilled. Sorry Chompies, this place has you beat! The black and whites are very good, much more cake-like and so moist. So happy to find a place that sells the pink and green leaf cookies from my childhood. They accept credit cards, sell all types of breads, cakes and other confectionery marvels...I am drooling just thinking of it.

Oh sweet Lord in Heaven, Last Chance is a crazy place. If you are like me, one of the freaks that arrives 10 minutes before opening and stands there waiting for the gate, you know you can find some pretty awesome deals. Yes it's a "resale" place, but there's plenty of new stuff too.  Here's the life cycle:  Nordstrom: Theory  Wool Sweater - $285, sale $199,  Nordstrom Rack - sale $99, Last Chance - $19, sale $5.00  The bottom line, this place is HIT or MISS, don't come with something too specific in mind. You can not Return ANYTHING so make sure you go over your finds with a fine tooth comb and inspect every inch, if you discover a rip once you get home, you are stuck with it. Don't expect much from the mens department, don't assume you are going to find that Marc Jacobs bag for $20, go to the bathroom first (upstairs in the little mall lobby area), be willing to dig and rifle through racks. Overall the thrill is in the hunt, and if you like super bargain shopping, this is your cup of tea.

I probably shouldn't review PF Changs, but feel it's my civic duty to warn anyone who still believes this is "Chinese" food, it's fusion, pretty Americanized and for whatever reason, always gives me the runs. ALWAYS! It's probably me, and you would think I have learned my lesson, but I try every so often to see if my stomach can handle it and every time, PF Chang's you bastard, you beat me.

One of those places you typically drive by and wonder, "wonder if that's any good?" Located right next to the blue and white mosque off Forest Avenue near ASU, Phoenicia gives you that feeling of eating off the beaten path. A co-worker of mine and I went on lunch, while we found a seat, the service was pretty slow. I ordered a plate of hummus (because I could down a tub of it in one sitting) and needless to say I was pretty disappointed. The hummus was not overly flavored - boring and bland. We split a falafel plate - consisting of 2 falafel pitas and rice. It was pretty good. Not spectacular, but decent. We also ordered some baklava to go - the traditional flavor was best, I don't recommend the chocolate one, too slimy.

Came for brunch, the service was wonderful, the bread/pesto was delicious (much better then the typical bread and butter!). I ordered the breakfast burrito and potatoes - also very tasty! Their homemade salsa was great too! The decor and ambiance is perfect for a date, hanging with friends, or taking a parent out to eat. I will definitely be back!

When it comes to fresh, local and wonderfully crafted ingredients, Essence hits the mark! The cafe is very tiny, and daily specials sell out quickly, so if you plan on ordering their lunch special of the day, get there early and plan on waiting in line! The baked goods, especially the macaroons are out of this world! If you aren't looking for bar food or the typical chain restaurant and want a light, healthy meal, this is it! It is more pricey (average meals range from $8-11) but that's the price you pay for local, organic, natural food. If you are looking for cheap, go to Subway. Closed on Sundays, which is a shame, because this is always when I want to do brunch!

I have only been here for lunch and would probably try it for a Happy Hour if their food was a bit more appetizing. For lunch I usually get a half sandwich (which is actually HUGE since one slice of bread is the size of a hardcover book) and a bag of chips which is reasonably priced for around $4.50. The food is OK, edible, but nothing exciting and sort of bland. I think it's the bread that needs some help, clearly size doesn't matter.

Out of both locations, this CP is the most intimate and cozy. I always sit at the bar, order a beer and watch the guys behind the counter do their thing. The PASTY, not PASTRY are really good for the most part. Stick to the classics like Shepard's Pie. Any of the other food styles (Italian, Mexican etc) aren't as good. Their soups are also delicious.

I'm not a huge Thai connoisseur, however I can say anyone considering trying Thai for the first time or someone who knows their Thai-stuff would find Yupha's fantastic.  Once you walk inside, you already feel welcome; not only by the friendly staff, but also by the comfortable atmosphere and fun, brightly colored walls.   Both my husband and I enjoy spicy food, however we were unsure just how hot, ordering "spicy" really was. So the server was kind enough to suggest we just order medium and she brought over the lovely trio of amazing sauces/spices so we could adjust our meals accordingly.   We started with the Siam Lettuce Wraps which consisted of minced chicken sautéed with lemon grass, galanga & crushed peanuts in brown sauce and served with two sauces on the side. Holy WOW, best lettuce wrap in the world. Period. Forgot the other places you have ordered this quintessential appetizer. This is the top of the mountain as far as I am concerned. Definitely worth a taste.   Based on the huge amount of Yelp reviews suggesting the Drunken noodles, we both decided to give them a try. I ordered mine with shrimp and the hubs ordered his with beef.  Drunken noodles are sautéed flat noodles with cabbage, tomato, bell pepper, onion, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper.   The Thai basil, spices and sauce gives this dish a flavor explosion and creates that palate friendly pyramid of sweet/spicy/fresh/tang that makes you say, "did that really just happen?!"   Ok, maybe I am being a tad bit over the top, but I am so thrilled to have found a fantastic Thai place with amazing food, comfortable atmosphere and great service. I am already planning my return visit!

Gotta love historic theaters playing off beat, artistic, foreign, documentary, etc films. Don't expect Transformers 18 to be on the marquee here. Check Harkins website for shows, show times and upcoming films. Films usually have a short run (1-2 weeks tops) so if you see one you like make sure you jump on it while it's still playing.   Parking for theater or anywhere on Mill: the Lot behind the condos off Ash in between 5th and 3rd, near Macayo's, the lot behind Z-Tejas off Maple, pay parking in the garage of Brickyard, east passed Urban Outfitters, more pay parking (not on weekends past a certain time - check City of Tempe for hours - off 5th and Forest Avenue - also close to lightrail station). Street parking with meters in front of House of Tricks and a mega lot that's new off University and College.   Overall: Great alternative to your typical dinner and a movie - try a movie here, and dinner at one of the great Mill Ave dining locales (La Bocca, House of Tricks, Cafe Boa, Canteen, Rula Bula, Z-Tejas etc)

There is always a debate among those who have visited Italy and tasted authentic gelato and think that G-Spot is right on the money or those who have that pretentious, "Well it's no where NEAR as good as it is in Italy, when I stay there bla bla." No duh it's not as good as if you were in Italy, but let me tell you, it's pretty damn close! Their cappuccinos and coffees are decent too.

Attention Chandler! Hidden Gem for lunch, step right up! The sandwiches are fantastic. The bread is fresh and the ingredients are top quality. Even the cupcakes are delicious. I have always walked by and thought they just sold wedding cakes (as they are always in the window), but they do so much more.

For those looking for a designer bargain, but would rather not drive the 30 miles to the Scottsdale location, this My Sister's Closet is sometimes the diamond in the rough. Because most of the super nice stuff migrates north, there aren't as many high high end merchandise, however don't let this prevent you from checking it out. I have found many a good deals on Free People, Ella Moss, Rich and Skinny, Paige, etc. If you are in the area don't over look this awesome spot. I just bought a vintage mini-cross body leather D&B for $14!

Addicted to the hunt! Rack is the outlet of Nordstrom however they do have current styles in stores now. It's hit or miss, as with any discount store, however I just head straight for the sale racks. Sometimes  you can find some amazing deals, (Cashmere sweater - originally $248, sale $19, Sam Edelman sandals $14, etc) you just have to be patient, check in often and cross your fingers.

Always preferred over Walmart based on customer service, lack of wild crowds and store layout. Great deli counter, great meat, organic chicken, frozen foods, clothing, electronics. You name it, they have it. Although not as inexpensive as Walmart (or even other SuperTargets, not sure what that is all about taxes for certain cities) the staff is always willing to help and AMAZINGLY knows where stuff is, MAGIC!

Usually whenever I'd be forced to visit a Walmart, I'd have to psych myself up just to get through the throngs of shoppers, vacant employees and dodge the hordes of screaming children with sticky fingers running around like maniacs. But this Walmart is different. Every time I go, YES, I have actually been going weekly now, I am surprised by the customer service (several cashiers are wonderful!), friendliness of the staff (thank you nice lady at the deli counter) and when I needed to buy an Otterbox from electronics, the guy assisting me was FANTASTIC, even put the case on for me.  I would usually insist on Target and pay more then deal with Walmart, but you have converted me, Arizona Ave Walmart - it's a miracle!

I found out about Snapdragon when I purchased a hair band on ETSY for my wedding. The ESTY gal used the salon on her models for her website and I fell in love with the hair. Alaina was the stylist used for the shoot and I was able to use her for my wedding hair. She was super friendly, easy to talk to and AMAZING with hair. My mop is very hard to work with, super thick and wavy, but she was able to replicate what she did for this photo shoot like it was nothing. The salon is adorable, the staff was very friendly. It is expensive, (otherwise I'd be back more!) but when it matters, it's definitely worth it.

Yucca is one of the best places to see local bands - no cover, cheap drinks and cool atmosphere. It gets a little crowded, but it only enhances a live performance experience if the band is good.

Fantastic! You get the idea from all the reviews, here's the compacted version:  1) Amazing architecture - inside YES, even from the outside alone (footbridge, garden area on East side, fountain, etc) 2) To see a performance - amazing acoustics, the wooden walls/ceiling create a fantastic venue! 3) Wedding - friend of mine just had wedding reception here, spectacular - they use Santa Barbara Catering (top 3 in the Valley - AMAZING) and the room was all glass, sat on the infinity pool that "merged" with the lake.  A must see - whatever the reason is!

Can't wait to go back. I was told they will be opening another location in Tempe, did I hear Southern and Mill? Somewhere nearby.  Great vinyl - I bought some classic Dead and Allman Brothers - 5 albums for about $39. They had tons of options, Jazz, R&B, Bluegrass, Rock, Pop etc. All of the albums I purchased were in excellent condition, no skipping or static. They also have CD's and other fun stuff.

Everyone loves Santans! This brewery produces some wonderful beer (although watch the hang over in the morning if you drink too many of them!) and has awesome bar food (beer bread/batter anyone!?) They usually have live music on Friday or Saturday and it gets pretty crowded - it's always a good time!

HOLY SUNDAY BRUNCH BATMAN! I've reviewed SanTan before for the regular Saturday night, beer/food type of evening and it is indeed great. But look out Saturday night, here comes Sunday!   Their mimosa's are made with their Hef/OJ/Champagne - great! Their mojitos are STELLAR! (hand muddled, fresh mint delicious!) Breakfast burrito was amazing, made with beer brats...  They serve 10am-2pm for Brunch and it wasn't that crowded at 11am, making it the perfect reason to get buzzed and gorge on the day of rest.

I have no clue how this place received so many good reviews. My mom is Italian, so I grew up eating and cooking New York Style Italian food and what came to our table was nothing of the sort. My husband took me here to celebrate my birthday and we were both so completely disappointed. I have never sent back food in my life, but we sent back TWO dishes - I could go on and on, but this place is closed now and it's horrid food is no more.

I came here for my wedding nails, pedicure and manicure (just paint no fake). I HATE having my feet touched, probably years of working in a  shoe store makes me judge my feet worse than anyone else would, but needless to say I prefer doing my own toes. But Pink Polish was wonderful for a treat. The ladies at the salon were friendly, professional and the service was relaxed and not rushed. I was in there for some time, even though it was a little pricey, I felt like it was worth every penny. The decor is adorable, very clean and relaxing. I will be back!

Another date night ends in disaster, well almost. My husband and my date nights are cursed, usually ending in violent bowel issues, vomiting, car accidents - you name it, we've probably experienced it, all in the name of a romantic evening. Monsoon season hits, and there goes the electricity/AC at Latitude Eight, the Thai wonderland we live down the street from and have been wanting to try for over two years. This is of course the fault of Mother Nature and not the restaurant. The staff was extremely gracious and kind, calling us "troopers" for saying to eat. And damnit I was going to eat!  Ordered: two adult beverages (I recommend that Mandarin Cosmo!) lettuce wraps (SUPER YUMMY) and the Pad Thai.  All of it was wonderful, the quality of the ingredients, the execution, the plating, the flavors. So while the beads of sweat rolled down our lower backs, at least the eatin' was good. The owner even bought us a round of drinks - now THAT is a good businessman because we will definitely be back (like the better part of Chandler no doubt). I will spread the word how even in 90+ degree temps and 100% humidity, the food and customer service upstaged that monsoon!

Great place to see up-in-coming artists while they are still students at ASU. No entry fee, but drop something in the donation jar.

Classy is not a word I  use when describing places I typically dine, but during Restaurant Week my better half, myself and 2 other couples decided to "oh Buffy" it up and pretend to be part of the upper crust. BLT did not disappoint.  The dining room is open, contemporary and inviting with a comfortable yet trendy feel without feeling like a stuffy, "rich person only" establishment. Our waiter was awesome, he knew we were about 2 martini's deep, so he kept it light and snarky, but with just enough of a smile.   Because it was Restaurant Week the menu was pretty basic, but never the less an excellent sampling of what BLT can do.  Even though we ordered off the "cheap" menu they still served us those famous pop-overs everyone raves about and some chicken liver pâté  with crusty bread.  Here is what I ordered:  First Course: Fried Deviled Eggs / Spanish Chorizo / Pimento Cheese - I have tried this at another local restaurant and wasn't that impressed, but for comparison gave it a go and WOW. This could have been a meal by itself, 3 egg halves fried to perfection with a lovely cheese sauce for dippin' - great for the non-adventurous eater. (I was able to sample the Wagyu Carpaccio and holy moly was that good, very thinly sliced and zesty.)  Second Course: 21 Day Dry Age Flat Iron / Grilled Ramps / Roasted Marrow Butter with a side of Broccoli  Mac and Cheese. Um, HOLY HELL this was FAN-EFFIN-TASTIC. I really can't stress how perfectly seared and cooked, how delicious and wonderful that steak was. The side was unbelievably good as well.  I am a brat when it comes to mac/chee and it was perfection. I also sample the white asparagus, which was to die for.   Desert: Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse / Banana Ice Cream and it was the perfect finale to an amazing meal.   I think BLT nailed their RW menu, not only did they blow us away with a great meal for a terrific value at $40/person, but they now have a future customer. So when I'm  craving a ridiculously well executed steak and great service for whatever occasion, I will think of BLT with mouth watering affection and most certainly be back.

My girlfriend does not eat gluten so we decided to try Indulge for lunch as they had a very extensive gluten free menu. I had every intention on buying a carnivore burger, however decided to try a veggie burger instead. If the name of the restaurant has "BURGER" in it, I am assuming a burger of the veggie variety would be fine as well. I even asked the server if it was a good veggie burger or if I should order something else, she said "We have VERY good veggie burgers...." Cough, riiiiight.    Our server was very prompt and friendly and suggested, if we were going to order fries off the gluten free menu, we should do so early as they take longer to prepare, so we ordered them in advance(baked not fried).  She came back to take our actual order and not 3 minutes later brought out the fries before the burgers. Ok, a bit early, fine by me. The fries were soft in many places and burnt in others. I thought there were, "MEH", my girlfriend thought they were gross.   A little while later my veggie burger was served! - a shriveled up cow-pie slapped between two buns with leaf of lettuce and onion perched on top. A pickle and some carrot shreds garnished the plate. The server saw my confused expression and said, "Oh we don't put anything on the veggie burger, but if you want some ketchup or mustard?" Seriously? No aioli? No spread? No hummus? or anything to damped down this dried up patty of cardboard?!  I ate half of it, primarily because it kept falling apart (nothing was used as a binder apparently), I had to eat it with a fork, but a spoon would have been better. It was so bad, I would have prefered one of those frozen Bocca or Morning Star veggie patties. For $9 it was such a joke.   My girlfriend's gluten free burger was a $12 burger on a salad. She asked for guacamole and asked if she should write it on the "build your own burger" menu pad they give you. The server said, "nope I will remember." Guess who forgot the guac. Her burger looked lackluster and somehow a dill pickle on a salad seemed wrong.   Frankly, I'd rather Indulge elsewhere.

I am such a huge fan of Grimaldi's! You know a pizza is amazing when you can do without any toppings and regular ole cheese tastes fantastic. The coal oven creates a lovely crisp crust and perfect melt to the cheese. The antipasto plate is delicious too! If you register for email updates on their website, they will send you an email for a FREE PIZZA for your birthday, up to $18 - well worth it! I love you Grimaldi's!!!!!

This location has more flavor options than Tempe Marketplace. Don't be fooled by overloading the giant cup they provide. They charge by the ounce and what may look like little is actually a lot, especially when you add toppings (and they sure have a lot of them, from real fruit to gummi bears and nuts)  My favorite combo of yogurt is to blend good ole chocolate with cookies n' cream then top with Oreo bits. Hmm, I want one now just thinking about it!

Came for Sunday brunch awhile ago and loved it. As does the entire Phoenix population of course so this is nothing new. Nothing I can say other than great!

Kara is amazing and our sitter, Dawn was fantastic. Our boxer loved Dawn and we felt he was well taken care of and spoiled while we were away. The peace of mind TLC gives pet owners who view their pets as children is priceless. I will use them in the future for sure!

I get dragged here because the hub is a Hawkeye and Sandbar just happens to be the only Iowa bar in the east valley. Saturday morning can be pretty crazy, however don't expect speedy service, or good service for that matter. Not sure what happened this year. Last season the service was much better, the servers were friendly and prompt.   One Saturday I came with the hub and a group of friends. We ordered  2 breakfast burritos off the brunch menu. 20 minutes later, the waitress came by to verify our order (she didn't even put the order in yet!) 40 minutes later we finally got our food. Our drinks took a millennium to get to us as well.   Now I get if a bar or restaurant is busy you will wait more than usual, but communicate that to us. "Hey we are swamped right now as you can see, I will get your order to you as soon as possible".  I get when the server has a bad day, we all have them, but it's hard to have a good experience when everyone has on a sour puss.   To be fair, the food we ordered was hot and tasty. Just wish they would -UP-  the customer service a little more.   **ALSO be warned, if you open a tab with a credit card, they put an automatic $50 hold on your account, maybe just bring CASH***

Sweet Jebus I must have more!!!! There is really no way to explain how amazing the burgers are...you must experience for yourself. No, seriously.   What reaching nirvana is to a yogi, Lobby's is to someone craving a quality beef burger. Is it your last meal on earth? starting that vegan diet cleanse tomorrow? You must try Lobby's at least once.  They also have Polish sausage, Italian beef sandwiches, chili cheese fries...(oh the humanity!!)   Fresh Iowa beef! 'Nuff said.

SHORT AND SWEET: Came for lunch on a Saturday at noon. It wasn't busy when we got there, was seated right away, but around 1pm it started getting crowded, the service was good, the food was delicious (pear, blue cheese salad ordered and it was fantastic!) the coffee was very good too. GREAT PLACE, cool ambiance. The End.

What a fun shop! I love me a good antique store and  was reasonably impressed with the collection of vintage/furniture/salvage/and antiques offered. Pricing was varied based on dealer booth (as is typical with nearly any antique store you visit) The staff was very friendly and eager to help as needed. Inside, the store is well layed out, large enough to explore, but cozy enough so you don't get eye fatigue.   Any antique fan looking for some treasure would enjoy a stop in.

This is my favorite TJ MAXX in the East Valley. As the other reviews say, it is clean, organized, and  well stocked. Don't forget to check the clearance sections.

Oh Robbie Fox's, since your opening the taste in my mouth has been pretty lousy. I hate to say this because who dislikes an Irish Pub?   NUTSHELL: good for drinking - strong drinks, the bartenders and wait staff are OK.  The food is GROSS. The most recent attempt was for a Happy Hour - ordered, shriveled chicken fingers so fried up and curled into a breaded mess, humus with pita (STALE) and veggies, their little pig in a blanket (sausage in pastry) with mustard (the only tasty thing about this was the mustard), otherwise the sausage looked like the mutilated remains of a botched circumcision.   On a Friday/Saturday the place is packed and if you are looking for a place to surround yourself with the youth of Mill, here's a great place. If you are looking for the character of a pub - you'll get it, but it will be a scrubbed down, Disneyland version with high gloss finish and disgusting food.

Parking: it's in the back, behind the yellow building that houses the bar. It's a small lot and fills up quickly so be prepared to cram your car into a tiny space! Always live music (most of it good), cheap drinks, good wings and fun atmosphere. The decor - a ton of old albums tacked to the wall, a built in drinking game (for every terrible 80s singer, take a drink!) It gets a little cramped on weekends, but that's the fun - no one likes an empty bar on a Friday night.

The best takeout/delivery pizza in Phoenix. Forget Papa Johns or Pizza hut. If you are in delivery range or pick up distance to a Barro's you will not be disappointed. The quality of their meat and veggie's is fantastic. Feeling the pizza craving? This is your best bet.   The crust is not too thick, not too thin, soft but crunchy, (is that possible?) YES. They are not heavy handed on the sauce, but combine a perfect blend of topping, cheese and tomato sauce goodness. The true test of a good pizza is either plain cheese or good ole pepperoni. Both from Barro's are excellent. They are a family joint, local and fantastic!

Yelp you have led me astray! I was so excited to try Beckett's Table; great reviews, hip and trendy customers, self proclaimed foodies galore, that totally original decor with the lofted ceilings and exposed wooden beams we are all so excited to see at every damn restaurant in town...but I digress.   I blame Restaurant Week and the menu chosen or should I say, slapped together by BT. I should have known better.   The menu included a drink, which we ordered in this case, a beer. I made mention to the waiter we were debating on menu's but would order the beer anyway since if we went with the RW option, it would be included. This was met with an initial "No problem," but halfway through our first course he came back and said he would be charging us for it because we had not decided on which menu we would be ordering from first. IE: I already rang your beer in a certain format in my POS and am too much of a tool to change it.    First course: onion and potato soup, not bad, creamy and flavorful  Second course: grilled shrimp (rubbery, overcooked shrimp, 4 baby sized), cowboy caviar (fancy way of saying  a teaspoon of corn and beans) avocado mousse (lime and cilantro infused pond scum), and supposed organic arugula salad ...never saw any arugula on my plate.   Desert: bacon chocolate s'mores, graham cracker, housemade marshmallow, caramel sauce, peanut butter mousse ....yeah, not sure how they could mess this up since it's on the actual menu however, the bacon was a greasy mess *yes I realize it's bacon, but once smothered in chocolate it really made for a salty, greasy mess. I think at this point I had about had it.   In fact the waiter and his beer comment made me so angry that I went to find the manager on duty and ask him about it. He looked at me like I was insane and condescendingly told me I was incorrect.   Anyway, the way I look at it, I could forgive your crappy RW menu, because that happens, but I can't forgive your douchy staff and rude comments. I'm out.

Been here twice - once for lunch, once for dinner.   Mellow is a bad name considering the location is where the old Z- Gallery was on Mill - warehouse style, exposed brick and tall ceilings, very bright lighting and slick laminate flooring. Not a place to break out the incense. (Perhaps the original locale was or some of the other franchises are, but this is not)  Lunch: small Greek style salad, toasted bread thing and soda - decent, good value Dinner: Portobello mushroom sandwich with red pepper, feta and sprouts - GROSS! It was so bad, I had maybe 2 bites before I threw in the towel - which is very rare for me I assure you, I am a notorious plate clearer, whether I am full or not. The mushroom was meely, gritty (not washed?) and very bitter and the toppings flavor didn't blend with the rest of the sandwich.  I tried my husbands medium wings -  they were slimy and luke warm at best when they were delivered. My friends got the cheese pizza and they were unimpressed by it. Maybe we just were there on an off night, but after our last visit I won't make the mistake of going again.

Finally, a music venue in Phoenix that encourages local bands as well as national acts. Intimate feel and "Smells like Team Spirit" bleachers and wait for it, AWESOME BATHROOMS, ladies don't wait in ridiculous lines any longer! Perfect to light rail too, so convenient. Can't say anything bad about Crescent! Now I hear they are doing FREE Sundays in Summer, super bad.

Styled like Dos Gringos with bright colors and the whole random stuff stuck to different surfaces - you walk in and get in the cattle drive line with a perfect view of the menu plastered to the wall. Great, easy enough. Their menu has all the basics, and the main reason to visit, SUPER CHEAP BEER!!!!   Our visit we had to wait 15 long minutes because the girl taking orders and pouring beer broke a glass into the rest of the glasses, having to cease all beer orders for what felt like forever.  I get it, shit happens, you drop stuff, but hello attitude. I even gave her a tip because I felt bad and tried to laugh it off with her, but to no avail. They never brought the beer over once it was all situated and had to hunt down someone to give us our much needed Friday fix. The food was "eh" - not a fan of the sauce on the shrimp tacos. Overall, I would go just to drink cheap beer - just don't make the girl behind the counter angry - then you'll never see your beer.

Visiting this fun Arcadia bar is like spending with rich college kids with bikes; everyone is young, well dressed and your select hangout locale looks trendy and cool. On the other hand drunken debauchery, bro dudes donning tank tops and faux hawks, squealing and fireball shots by the dozen seemed to prevail, no one had a care in the world. Did I mention it was 6:30?   The Little Woody isn't hard to find if you look to the NE corner of Indian School and the side street (42nd place). Just pull down the side street when you see the neon bird eyes commanding you stop to have a drink. The bar is dark, covered in REAL wood cross sections and cozy. You can order food or play skee ball, darts or shuffleboard. There is no outside area so it's not ideal for smokers, but great when it's either a zillion degrees outside or pouring (like that ever happens). The bartenders were attentive and prompt. Overall, a great little neighborhood bar that's a fun stop on your Arcadia bar tour.

Fantastic!!!! Came for a beer/dinner pairing special menu and was blown away by the food quality, originality and general friendly staff and service. The chef really took the time to create a wonderful menu that works perfectly with the different craft brews! Can not wait to come back!

My amazingly "in the know" girlfriend recommended we try Crepe Bar for breakfast and was sold the moment she said "crepe." They did not disappoint!   I ordered the savory breakfast burrito filled with fluffy scrambled eggs, bacon, avocado salsa, jack cheese all tucked inside a chipotle crepe. The crepe was soft, with a spongy texture and with that chipotle flavor, it really made for an interesting twist on the usual breakfast burrito so prevalent in Phoenix.  Keep in mind you will need a fork and knife to eat it, but the quality of ingredients and combo of favors made it a solid option. I also ordered a hot mocha from the counter and it was fantastic.   We arrived around 9:30am and it was already pretty busy, as other reviews say it can be a bit of a wait, so plan accorded. But it is definitely worth if!

Just what Chandler's growing downtown area needs, a country bar!    First round review at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon probably isn't a good gauge of how Bourbon Jacks operates for weekend nightlife, however we went for some food and to take a look-see at the vibe and to determine whether it was worth it to come back.  The bar is wedged in a narrow space off Boston and Arizona Ave in downtown Chandler, park in the gravel lot behind the buildings, across from the City of Chandler building. It's a long, narrow bar with super neato exposed brick to one side and rustic, wooden bar on the other. The reviews from others about the atmosphere are pretty spot on. See pictures too.  My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the corn bread and bowl of chicken chili. His sandwich looked pretty decent, he said, "not the best he's had, but pretty darn good." The corn bread was served in a tin, about the size of a dessert plate with a side of the most delicious orange, sweet butter ever! I would definitely recommend an order to split with your table. The chili was very tasty, not spicy, but had very good flavor depth, little pieces of pickled jalapeno and onion sprinkled on top really rounded out the overall taste.  We both ordered the Lumberjack IPA, a hoppy beer in 20 oz glass, cost $7 - wish we were there for happy hour!  Our server was FANTASTIC! I wish I knew her name because she was so genuinely friendly and helpful. The whole staff was very nice.  The bands play a Wednesday-Saturday, according to our server anywhere from 8pm-1am, mostly a mix of country with a little bit of classic rock, also according to our server.   We will definitely be back!

Great new spot on the second floor of the freshly opened College Avenue Commons. Vantage point from the patio offers great views and a modern, classier edge for the sophisticated ASU faculty member or administrative staff. They have happy hour deals including $1 off house wines and $5 beers (think local craft from San Tan). The small menu offers nibbles but this prime location is a great starting point for a Friday Happy Hour. Soon to join the area: Local fave Postino and Snooze. Overall, worth a chance to hob-nob with Dr. Crow and his elite inner circle.

What a great alternative to the other chain burrito houses! This review may be a tad bias because I have recently moved from Phoenix to the Midwest, therefore a fresh take on designer burritos makes me insanely happy! Uberrito is a TX based operation with only a handful of stores.  The atmosphere: casual, bright and trendy and clean. If you don't grab your food to go, you will feel comfortable devouring your meal at one of the booths.   The food: I admit, I didn't orders burrito. I had two tacos: pork and the vegetarian. The pork was insanely good! Each taco is priced around $3, a little steep but when you see the quality of ingredients - you understand why.  The flavor of each taco was spot on and very fresh.   The service: excellent, everyone behind the counter was helpful and friendly!   If you are in the area, Uberrito is worth a try! I can only hope they look to open a franchise in Iowa.
