Horrible customer service. They have cover charges that they don't tell you about. The hookah quality is bad. I am always disappointed here, and will never go back.

I usually don't write reviews, but this was an amazing customer experience. It's obvious the owners put thought in to it. Can't wait to come again!

They have the most authentic Arabic food in the valley. Tastes just like In Jordan/Palestine and I've never experienced that here in the U.S. Amazing food- excellent customer service.
