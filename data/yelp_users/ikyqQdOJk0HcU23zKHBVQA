I have been twice for happy hour. All their burgers are $7 during this time. I had one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had and definitely the best in the valley. My next visit I had the escargot with bleu cheese and it was delicious! I only wish the bread it was served with had been toasted otherwise it was perfect. I can't wait to visit the Gainey Village location.

The pic you see on Yelp is not The Corner Deli, its of Chole's Corner in Kierland Commons. The Corner Deli is across from Scottsdale Quarter in the AIrpark. The atmosphere is very basic but the dining area was bigger than expected. Service was very friendly and our sandwiches were great. Pretty cheap, about $ 7 or 8 for a sandwich drink and a side.

I've been here twice. I don't eat meat, only seafood. The first time I ordered the green chili tamale and a shrimp enchilada.  The tamale was  bland and dissapointing. However, the shrimp enchilada was awesome! My friend was not pleased with his entree but I cant remember what it was.  He said he believed it was prepared the way they intended , he just didnt like the flavor.  Our server was intrusive.  We were there for lunch so im sure a lot of people want to eat in a hurry. He non verbally made it clear that once we were done eating, it was time to go.  There were plenty of open tables in the restaurant I think he was just ready to get his shift over with.

Don't order the calamari, it was the worst and so chewy! I had a spinach salad, it was OK. My friend had tri-tip sliders on of which barely had any meet on it, but his fries were good. Service was very good which was a pleasant surprise.

This place is awesome. I have a 4 month old Golden mix with a lot of energy. He is always looking for a dog to play with but I don't like the city dog parks. Raintree is a safe, clean and fun environment for him to become socialized and have a blast. The receptionists always recognize him and greet him with smiles. When I come to pick him up I don't have to describe my dog to them, they just know who he is. He is always happy to be there and takes a nice long nap when we get home. We love it!

I don't understand why this place is still open. I ordered the endive salad which had nice toppings but the endive was inedible had had no flavor. Also the salad was huge and endive was 90% it. My friend had a chicken penne pasta that I could have easily made better at home and I am not a good cook. The service was overwhelming at first, we were greeted by three different people, then half way through our meal it was nonexistent. We watched a busser service all the tables around us while our server had disappeared. Even a man who appeared to be a manager/ owner cleared the empty plates from the diners next to us, offered them dessert and coffee and delivered their dessert. Meanwhile, my guest and I seemed to be completely invisible. I assume this is because we both had most of our food still on our plates and no one wanted to ask why we hadn't eaten it. Still no server around, the busser finally comes and asked if we are finished, we say yes and he takes our mostly full plates without concern if we enjoyed it. I didn't volunteer any info since the service was so bad I wouldn't go back even if I liked the food. I work in a restaurant so I know the difference between a server who is swamped and a lack of interest.

The St Germain martini is Awesome!! I loved the cauliflower app. My sandwich was just ok, but I would definitely go back and try something else.

I went back recently after a D backs game. It wasn't our first choice but every other restaurant was swamped with other baseball fans. However, my BF remembered that we enjoyed our food last time had seen other things on the menu we would try. That being said, the menu had changed since the last time we visited. We struggled to find something interesting to order. We were starving so we stayed. We both ordered one of their specialty cocktails since they seemed unique. My BF drink was not mixed well, all the alcohol was on the bottom. The drink was served in a tall skinny glass which made stirring a bit difficult causing him to spill his drink. Our server was busy with other tables so we cleaned up the mess ourselves. When our server reappeared I told him what happened and asked for a fresh drink. He looked around at our clean table as if he didn't believe us! I had to explain that we had already cleaned it up and the food runner took away the garbage in his absence. He said he would talk to a manager and walked away. Although I was offended by his insinuation, I almost felt bad for him. I thought, what kind of clientele does he deal with that he would assume we were lying about a spilled drink. He did return with a fresh drink. Overall, our experience was average at best. With so many cool restaurants downtown I probably wont go back.

The fried cheese curds are delicious. The rest of the food was good too. I think I had a salmon special. Service was good. My only issue was a small one. I ordered a coffee and it was served with one sugar cube. I am a person who likes my cream and sugar with some coffee in it, LOL. I asked for some artificial sweetener and was brought two packets. Really? I'm not going to empty your sugar caddy into my purse, I just want to drink my coffee the way I like it. Anyway, I didn't want to bother with it any further so I drank what I could and went on my way. If I was in the area I would go back.

The night I dined here there was a business meeting going in the main dining room. So we were forced to sit in a tiny area in the front if the restaurant. The lights were up all the way ruining any chance of ambiance and we could hear the entire meeting. They had a chalkboard advertising many different coffee drinks, but the machine was broken. My friend had the meatball sub and I ordered a salad. Both were ok, nothing special. The server was very sweet, but I would not go back.

I went on a slow day to get a gel mani and regular pedi. They were vwry nice and took me back right away. I wasn't excited with the gel colors they offer. There are many to choose from but nothing really jumped out at me. Some of the "model nails" looked like they had just slapped on one coat so it was hard to get an idea of the actual color. They did offer to do my nails at the same time as my pedicure, which was great since I just want to get in and out.  Overall, good nails and good service.

I love the atmosphere and live entertainment. I usually sit on the patio near the fireplace. So far I've only had appetizers but the rest of the menu looks good. Service is always friendly. I've heard it's a Nebraska bar too.

This is the best gym. Everyone is very friendly and the workouts are great. The Koko program keeps me motivated and up to date on my personal results. Workouts are guided so it makes it easy to stay focused.

I bought a Groupon for this cafe because the menu looked awesome, so many great vegetarian options. They also have Salmon and Tuna salad available. I ordered the Spicy Tuna Panini which was fantastic. The sandwiches come with a salad and they were nice enough to make me a new salad when I told them I can't eat cucumbers. The owner introduced himself to me while I was waiting and everyone who worked there was very friendly. The owners son, who made my sand which, took the time to explain all the pastries that they have for sale. I bought two, one savory and one sweet. I can't wait to try them. I will definitely go back. This place might be my new favorite :)

Revolving Sushi. I love that I can sit down and immediately start eating, LOL. They have a lot of different rolls to choose from but sometimes they are all very similar. So far I like the Hawaiian roll the best. They also have other items at the revolving bar like cooked items and desserts. I believe they have a full menu you can order from as well.

Small family owned restaurant.  The food is very good and always prepared fresh.  The decor is terrible but the great service and good food make up for that. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a visit.  Im sure you will enjoy it, unless Olive Garden is your idea of good Italian food.

I love it. I went two days in a row! Both times had the vegetarian tacos with black beans. I can't wait to try their quesadillas. You must have the mint lineage to drink. The food is super fast and much better than anything I've had at Chipotle.
