Horrible company to deal with, internet service is always down, and constantly increasing prices without  notification.

This place is awesome!!!  I love their bbq bleu cheese burger. They have awesome fries, their bathrooms and really cool and I like all of the condiments available to help yourself with.  Last but not least the atmosphere and ambience are amazing! I live this place.

I needed a laptop charging cable and the gentleman was sooo nice and gave it to me for free. These guys just aren't trying g to take your money,  I highly recommend them!

This place is awesome! Where else can you find a place that delivers breakfast burritos? Not to mention that the food is EXCELLENT! I got the bacon and egg breakfast burrito as well as the supreme breakfast burrito and they were both awesome. Lastly, the customer service is awesome and the guy is always very friendly. 5 stars!

Took our car into a different shop to get the transmission fluid flushed because they charged a decent price. We go to pick up the car and they tell us we need all new brake pads and two new front rotors. I ask how much and the guy says $650 plus tax. I had to pick my jaw up from the ground. I was recommended to Choice Auto Repair by my dad and am so thankful I was!! Kevin was able to get us in first thing the next day. He called and informed us that only the front brake pads needed to be replaced and that he could resurface the front two rotors instead of replacing them. The grand total was $150 plus tax. This shop is awesome, I will never take any of my cars anywhere else. I really do appreciate their honesty and fair prices.

The sandwiches used to be awesome, but the last two times I've been here the sandwich is mostly bread and is very dry.

Good food,  nice atmosphere, decent prices. I got the Chikichanga and it was excellent. The only complaint is my wife ordered her eggs over easy and they were over medium.
