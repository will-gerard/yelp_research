Don't get me wrong, I love Cox.. I'm a cox kinda girl. O.o   As for this location.. Not a fan. Thank god they brought Cox to Surprise.   Always a long wait here. Always a pain in the ass to get anything handled without stressing out. Don't even think about bringing your kids in here. I'd compair it to going to MVD. Go early, like 10 minutes before they open and you will see why. Parking is a bitch, shared with other local business'.    I'd love to write a nicer review, I hate being a Debbie downer, but try don't care about my time, so why should I care about their review. Plus, I just can't did anything nice to say.

Having Lupus, I am a regular in emergency rooms.  What can I say, I need to marry a doctor this next time around!  I didn't appreciate that I had to remind them over and over that I had a morphine allergy, and what happens when I have morphine.  As well as screaming in pain and being told that "it's all in my head"!! Really?! Ok, whatever... Lesson learned, the doctor was great, the nurses as well, but the triage and desk girl, awful.  They really need to be more "patient" ( no pun intended!) with patients, not all of us are in there for a drug fix, educate yourselves bout Lupus and be nicer to your patients, without us, you wouldn't have a job. ;)

I love me some Home Depot!!!!  I can always find what I am looking for, and if I can't, someone is always 2 steps away and can help me!!   The store layout is easy to navigate. It's as clean as a Home Depot can be. Employees are awesome. I prefer to come here vs Lowes. Ugh.. Hate that place.   Find me here at least once a week - usually withy iPod blasting as I breeze through the store finding what I need.  Every first Saturday of the month is a cool kids building mornings. It's free - again, where Lowes fails, they charge!

PetSmart...   Always a delight to come in here. Nothing better than an afternoon at a FREE ZOO! Wait, what's that noise, my kid crying for a pet!   We came here 2 weeks ago and the employee who helped us was AMAZING. My sons first hamster and she made sure we purchased the right breed for his age. I didn't know that there was a difference. She rocked!   We went again on the 25th for my daughters Birthday. That employee was a bi*ch! She was rude, mean to my daughter and just downright nasty. Pissed me off. I'm sorry if I asked you a question and it's your job to help us. So a star deducted for her attitude.   It's all we have here in Surprise, so we will be back. if we had somewhere else to go, I would. Nobody makes Sierra cry. (but me! lol!)

Dinner Crawl in Surprise. It's Panda  Express.  This is fast food imitation Chinese food!! It's good for what it is.  Want upscale, go to Pei Wei, that's not good enough, go to PF Changs! (see where I'm going with this?!)   It's Panda Express, get the green bean chicken, feel good about being nice and leaving an honest review.. ;)

I love this store!!! So much they know me by name and if there isn't a line I'll sit and shoot the shit with the employees!! Haha! That's how shopping should be... Like Cheers!   You'll find everything you need here. And like other stores, things you don't need to!   (good store, stocked, nice employees. Sorry, it's a CVS, I can't write a "real" review. You get what you get here, a drugstore!)

It's Target!!! Starting with the $1.50 popcorn and soda combo which you leave a popcorn trail all over the store!! You go in for a toothbrush, and leave with dog food - for the dog you don't even own, a wedding registry - for the wedding you aren't even having, a Shabby Chic sheet and comforter set - for the queen bed you don't own, soda, popcorn, candy - for the diet you are already failing and lastly, a new iPhone for the AT&T contract you had no plans on renewing. :) So moral of the story, don't go in!! I love Target!!!

There are a lot of families here to skate tonight, yet no one is here. Website says one time, sign on office says another. Oh, did I mention the flier in the lobby says another? No times on their voicemail either. Disappointing. This is our second time here today. No one mentioned there was no public skating tonight. They said they WOULD be open.

Dragnet and I hopped on the motorcycle for an afternoon ride. We found ourselves up in Wickenburg, and wasn't sure where to eat.  I've been through Wickenburg many times, on my way to Vegas. The only times I have stopped, have been at Denny's to use the facilities. ;)   We decided to drop in here, after walking up and down the main street reading menu's. The food was great, the owners were really sweet, they kept making sure all of the customers had everything they needed. Locals eat here, so thats a great sign.   I ordered the biscuts and gravy - HUGE plate!!! It had to be one of the best recipes I have had. Made from scratch, very filling. We actually got there right before they closed. They didn't turn us away, and like I mentioned, the food tasted fresh, not like it was the bottom of the pot, end of the day gravy.   Check them out, support local business owners.   Overall, I would and will eat there again.    There it is Yelp. A great business to select as my final review.

Disney!!!!!  Sometimes this is as close as my kids can get to the Mouse of the House. While it is awesome to have a Disney Store so close, there are a few drawbacks. (No pun intended!). It's rather small. The illusion from the enterence with the glittery 3-D floor is that you are walking into a huge store, but that's not happening. It's cramped, confusing and cluttered. I'd imagine if my kids were smaller, I'd lose them right and left.   So why the high rating? 1. The employees are awesome!  2. It's a Disney Store here in the Valley  3. They offer a lot of gift items you can't find anywhere else but the Parks. Not Walmart or    Target.  4. It's DISNEY!   You'll find it here, if not, you need to drive 5 hours to Anaheim and look there! ;)

Am I the ONLY person in the state who doesn't need to eat here?  Can someone tell me what I am missing?  I just don't get the hype.  The food is ok, nothing stands out as "must come back for".  I will keep coming, because my sister and mother are addicted, and I am sure there is something on the menu I can find that I will like.

It's Walmart.... Look at "People of Walmart" and see why this place offers Unlimited entertainment while you shop!!  :)   It's nice when the Snowbirds are away, once they have landed, I'll stick to El Mirage.  The new 303 store is smaller than these 2, but larger than the one on Reems.   My friend was in a car accident on the 303 in 07.  Car was totaled out and the cars seats for her twins needed to be replaced.  The manager donated 2 top of the line (for WalMart) replacements for us to give to her.  That was super kind.  I'm going to go from 3 stars to 4 for that alone.

We are having some motorcycle issues. My brother has been building bikes and cars for over 25 years, so he is walking Dragnet through what needs to be done. Basically his 2012 bikes chain came off.. Not good. Not his fault. He actually flipped off the bike when the chain came off. on Bell road, luckily nobody took him out. Now he has a lot of $$$$ work that needs to be done. And you bet your butt Ride Now will be covering it.   From what I have read and heard, I'd stay away from here when it comes to buying anything with a motor.

I try.. Really I do. But I am a ToGo's girl. I grew up with my #9 pastrami sandwich. This location was fast, they did good with our food, well as good as you can with processed meats. :/ My only complaint is the layout of the store. Could have been configured better. I only gave it 2 stars because when I do eat here, I always get sick. Now if I lost weight, I'd give them a star back! Haha!

Get your killer gas discounts one, in store says up to $1.00, but now signs outside say up to $2.  I find that I have to ask for a receipt at the pump and I have no issues with the discount. The times I forget to hit yes for a receipt, I get robbed by st least .10 cents, once .40. I've seen other customers with the same issue.    As for the store, for being a newer one, it's lacking a lot. I'd drive up to Cotton and Bell, but I just go to Frys. The pharmacy is good, always have my meds in stock every month like clockwork.  Check expiration dates, but that's Safeway in general, not just this location.

It's Bank of America... I like this one over the Bell and Grand  Ave. location.  They are helpful, the drive thru is sometimes slow, but it's not their fault that people use the drive thru lane without knowing or having their transaction ready.

Back for more Philosophy. Guys, it's the best gift idea ever for your girls!! I love this place!!  For years I have been watching Pholosophy on TV and in the stores. I finally bit the bullet and went in to Ulta to see what the hype was all about. Im hooked!! No need to find a Sephora, Ulta has it all!

Sonic!!! Happy hours for drinks - Slushies to go off any diet for - tator tots like those we all grew up eating in school - chili cheese dogs - breakfast all day - loss meals with lots of options - ice cream - drinks with so many combinations much like going to the Jelly Belly factory in Northern California and eating 4 different beans to make an awesome drink!!   Only negative - broken cars reader machines. Don't use them if they are broken. The location in Surprise off of Reems and Bell had a big issues with their broken card readers a few years ago. A lot of banking accounts were phished and $$ galore was missing. Of its cracked, it's hacked. Have them run it, get a receipt and check your banking often for theft activity.

I've shopped here off and on over the years. I was shocked when I went in this morning to find that the prices went up - and not by a little. Some of the toys I saw there cost more at abig Lots as the same toys at Target or Walmart. Ive never seen that before at this store. The store is stocked full and is so disorganized.   If I am going to spend that amount, I might as well go to Walmart or Target and have an easier return policy should anything need to be returned.   Sure, there are little things there that you can't fid anywhere else, and that is the bonus. But the downside, the lines. One cashier per shift. Now that the snowbirds are back, it's not worth it.

Took the kids here lastnight for dinner.  I woke up, that is a good sign.  I am bummed to see that in 2 years we were away, this place really took a dive.  The prices went up, thequality of the food went down and got smaller, the service was awful,  our order was all jacked up.  I could go on and on. Just because my son and I ask for no sauce doesn't mean we don't want the sour cream.  The shit was dry and we had to power down our food with soda shots like we were on Fear Factor.  No refills... Chips sucked. Ok, thats right I was trying to stop the "compliment" train.   We used to love coming here, now we will add it to the don't eat at list with Carrapas.  Even our server looked like he would have rather been anywhere but there.  Sad thing is, I remember him from when we used to dine here all of the time.  Poor guy used to be so chipper and happy.  Place sucked the life right out of him.  My one complaint is about paying.  I used to be a server, I know how this works.  All I had on me was a $100.  Dinner came to roughly $40.00.  All large bills when he gave me change.  Yes, I know they aren't a bank.  And I did not take off stars because of this gripe.  But just because I pay like a high roller doesnt mean I am one, and I am not going to over tip because all of the sudden once you saw my loot you thought you could save the last 90 minutes of torture we endured.  A $5 and 5 ones would have been nice. There was NO way I was about to spot a $20!   When a customer sits at your station why don't you treat them like a friend, not a bastard step child and maybe, just maybe I would have spotted you a few extra bones for making the most of the crappy night.

Super nice to have Leslie's right in my neighborhood. Great place, super friendly employees. Bring your pool or spa water in and they will test it for you. Saves lots of $$$$$$ and frustration when you don't know what is off and you have tried everything. Maybe tried too much!!

I am sad to write this review... As I used to LOVE this place. However as of late, it's been hit and miss. More miss than hit. (Insert sad face here!)   The prices have gone up, serving size has gone down. I'm all about understanding the economy and what not... However this was the best part of eating here.   I've learned that it's cheaper to order my food ala carte at lunch than as their "special lunch combo".   For example;   Lunch menu - white rice, sweet sour chicken is $5 (roughly). However if you want the house fried rice (it's so yummy and filling!) it will cost you $4 more! What??!! That's right, almost the cost of the whole meal. So now it's $9 for the "lunch special". (It used to be $1.75 up-charge.)  The second to last time I ate there after ordering my lunch (to go) with the upgrade and adding in fried won-tons it came to $14.79. Twice the price as a week before! No joke, it was!!!! First time ever I have never tipped them. Why? what they told me over the phone and then charged me were 2 different prices! The next time I went, I ordered ala carte and it was the same price but with WAY more food.   Bottom line - order containers at lunch if you want the rice upgrade. The food is good, which is the only reason I gave them 2 stars.   My stars explained: (1) location, ease of parking, lights,  (2) how clean and organized they are, restrooms etc.. (they have never earned a star from me)  (3) value. which I count as 2 stars 1 * for cash/debit/credit and 1 * for price of food vs quality of food, size of servings.

I grew up eating at Paradise Bakery in California - it is funny because there aren't any left in No Cal, but they are in AZ now!!??!!  I come for the nibblers, my kids go for the Mac and Cheese.  I am not a fan of the "free cookie", I am not a big chocolate person - WHAT - I know!!  And the cookies are chalked full of chocolate.  Otherwise, I love the place.  Can't complain - which makes it a great day!!

Excellent library. Here its not just about books. Its a community. Activities for all ages. Story times, teen activities and more.   We have always found books we need. They have magazines, movies, computers you can use. Everyone is friendly and nice. Lovely location. Across from Spring Training, next to the park, dog park, fishing hole. Ample parking for such a busy area.   We love coming here. Books are kept in order, easy to find. Someone is always around to help you should you need help or get lost. :)

Really good pizza! I never knew they were here before. Dragnet and I went with his mom for lunch here. It was like $5 for 2 huge slices of pizza and a soda. 4 different lunch specials. Cant complain at all. Nice family run business. They have a huge menu with more than pizza. Now that I know it's here, I'll be back.

Been here twice. Not a fan. First time was good. Had the 2 slice pizza and drink combo for $4.00  Tonight we had pizza and wings. Wings are super hot, for medium. Not too happy about that. Although they did offer after awhile of seein my daughters mouth on fire to tame them down. But then they came back cold. $45 plus for so so food. No thanks.   Good for lunch combos - that's about it. Sucks because I'm all about supporting independent business owners.

We ate here in June. While it was great, it was nothing that would make me jump off the freeway and stop if I saw it and was hungry. I'd compair it to a glorified Fudruckers with a Hawaiian twist. I know we had a few issues, nothing I can remember--- but enough that well over a month later I remember that it wasn't smooth sailing. :) Give them a try, you might find heaven in there. Who knows.

Morning workout. I owned Napa, I've got to catch up here!!  With that said, if you can think of the WORST theatre you have been to, multiply that hate by 1000, you would really appreciate this place!  We were spoiled at Ultra Star, moved to Napa, to an old Centuty Dome - haunted theatre, still using movie reels and nappy chairs.  Blah!   I digress, my review is for Ultra Star. It's AMAZING! The fact they offer morning movies for moms and dads, is a winner in itself.  I don't know about you, but there is nothing more annoying than watching a sex scene or a murder / rape scene and having little Timmy 2 year old slurping his boob juice behind you asking over and over "what's that, what's that?!". The motion seats are $$, but are worth it for those great movies.   Love this place, daycare would e a plus like Harkins offers, but isn't a deal breaker! See me here at least 1 to 2 times a week, seeing something. :)

What can I say, I'm a sucker for Pei Wei.  When we lived in California, I heard the place was shut down.  Glad to move back and see it open.    Take out rocks, call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much!   The only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise, I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :)

Reopened!!!  This location was a godsend when it first opened years ago. It's a little hard to get to now with all of the 303 / Greenway traffic. However now that it has reopened, we were super excited to go back!! If you haven't eaten here, give them a try. It's a nice break from Subway (who's becoming more and more over-priced!) and you'll be giving back to a local business owner - not a major chain. They give baxk to the community, so thats a major bonua right there!! I hope they can make it and stay open. Hopefully the local construction crews are dining there to keep them afloat until the 303 is complete!! That is their only downfall I see. Otherwise like I wrote before, check them out.

It's Mc Donalds!! I can lay in bed, check in and write a review. Literally, it is that close!! Ha Ha! Much like the reviews people leave for Denny's and other lower end eating facilities that make them sound like they are supposed to be 4 star, this isnt going to happen with me. Its fries, shakes and imitation burgers - I lived in Napa, I know the difference now!   So yes, its newer. Its almost always busy, the next closest drive thru Mc Donalds is up the road - oh, and they are building a new one at Reems and Greenway.

Maybe it's just me, but I'm a dipper. I like to tear my bagels and dip them in cream cheese. It's a control thing, don't judge!!   So yesterday I saw the flashing lights of Einsteins. (Not literally!) But I was flying along Dysart and saw the store. Flipped a bitch (u-turn) and went back. (Sorry red Toyota, didn't mean to cut you off!) . Never noticed it before, but I usually take Litchfield to I-10.  Why does this matter? Because I had a bagel! And I'm writing a review. ;)~  Anywho... Like I said I'm a dipper. I like to dip my treats in warm gooey goodness. Einsteins smothered the hell out of this bagel. Which is ok, since I was paying for cream cheese, I'd rather have more than less and not feel like I was ripped off.   Driving down Dysart with my sonic coke and cream cheese all over. There was more white on that little bagel than up a hookers nose. It was good. I'll be back. They have more than bagels, they have pastries, eggs, coffee, tea... Good place next time I'll just ask for my dip on the side and see if you get just as much.

I've been here a few times. Most recent for a ONS. Thank god Surprise has more than The Windmill down Bell. It's a good hotel. A little pricy, and I'll tell you why..   A- It's spring training central for the 2 teams Surprise hosts. The players stay here during the spring AND summer / fall. There are second string players who stay here to train at the ballpark. How do I know this? I used to be the property manager at Park Place condo's where the line up players stay. Man, those were killer parties!! So ok, it's $$$ because they can be.   B- they are not an "by the hour" hotel. So if you are like me and are in the middle of a fling and don't want said guy to know where you live, this is a nice, clean, comfortable bed. With breakfast included on your way out the door. ;)   Joking aside, it's a nice newer hotel.

I've never been a fan, ever since I was here years ago and they tried to get me to buy a package, I said no and they flunked up my car.  My (x) husband came back weeks later for a $10 car wash, and left with the $180 package each - for both of our cars!! Yeah, saw him coming a mile away!  I hate the sales pitches. Just give me the half assed car wash.  We just moved back, I have my CA plates, needed to get all of the collective I-5 amd I-10 bugs off my grill, and was blown away with the "fear" that they use for the poor out of state people "The paint is being eaten off with the bugs enzymes...". Lmfao! I can't imagine how much they make off of the snowbirds!  Go to TNT across the street.  I need to remember to do the same.

Great place right around the corner. In and out. I had to leave a few things overnight, but wasn't worried about them. Next up Antique linens. That will make me a lifelong (or as long as they are open!) customer if they don't eff them up!

I went in with hopes that I would be blown away. Most of the crap I have done is at Del Web out in Sun City West. So I was excited that I would be having a procedure here and that I would be spoiled from everything I read and was told.   My medical records were lost, I tried to warn the nurse that my veins roll and aren't happy with needles, she didn't care - until it happened to her. Then she wanted to hear all about what I had to say about which arm works better and why. A random nurse walked around telling everyone she was lost and didn't know where she was. Which again, 20 minutes before I am to go into Surgery was the LAST thing I wanted on my mind!! My medical record was eventually found - in recovery - however I was still I pre-op. they all laughed it off, I freaked out! One of the doctors on my team made it a point to tell everyone she had never worked with my surgeon before and she had no idea who she was looking for. I could go on and on. Why am I writing all of this? Because as a patient I shouldn't have had to hear ANY of this. I was more stressed going in, hoping the right procedure was being done with the right doctors than anything leading up to my surgery.   The plus side. Private rooms, food delivered around the clock, and the volunteers that gave us a mini tour when I checked in. Otherwise, I'll stick to Del Web from here on out.   As for my doctors, I'll review them separate.

Outstanding!! Clean tanks. Clean foot "utensils". Great non "bubble" nail polish. I was there for the deluxe which was $30, and lasted for well over an hour. My nappy feet are once again happy feet. ;) Ohhh and only once was there that uncomfortable talk between the girls - you know what I am talking about!!!! Are try talking about my foot gunk or the customer sitting next to me.. Hee he Hee crap. None of that. :) 5 stars for that alone. They all speak English. 10 more stars for that!

Where to start?! I used to spend my teenage years working the drive thru. So much fun!! So I know what's in the food, I know how it's made... And that right there should be enough for me to know better than to eat there, or let my kids eat there!!   That said, it's cleaner than other Toxic Bells, the drive thru is always busy and they are fast - which is a good sign, because that means the food turn over rate is high. I try to stay away from the mystery meat.   It's Taco Bell after all. If I wanted real Mexican, I'd go to Chevys! (lol) anyone who sits and writes out a "real" review, get over it. ;)

In all of my years of getting pedicure's, this has to be in my top 3 worst places and experiences. It's so bad, instead of sitting here and enjoying my $35 (say what!!) pedicure, I am typing a review on Yelp. I'm not even going to add up all of the reasons it's sucked. I'm going to let the statement stand. "Typing review WHILE getting pedicure".... It is that bad!!!!!!

Always changing, if you find something you like, buy it that day! Odds are it won't be there when you go back.  There are some great deals to be found here.  Everything for the home, and then some.  Employees are super helpful.  The clearance areas are spread out, and those deals are better.  Most of the time it's small blemishes that are hard to spot.  Great store, check the, out.  Give them 2 tries before you write them off,  because the inventory changes.   Like the changing inventory, each store is different. Peoria is more empty (customer wise) than the other locations I have been to. .  :). Happy shopping!

Before we moved back to CA (the story of my life!)  we were here SO much they actually knew who we were, what we ate, how we ate it, and then we moved. :0(   Now that we are back, we have been a few times, they haven't remembered us yet. Boohoo...  But we are suckers for the chips!!  This location is easy to get it, parking is a lot better than it used to be and it is just worth the extra swearing waiting for a parking spot to open!  Be patient to those who havent eaten there before.  Remember the first time we were all confused!!  I hate seeing jerks in here being rude to newbies!  Just help them figure it out and we will all get through the lines!

Heaven!!!  What can I say, I love this place.  Granted, it has not tasted the same since we moved back, and we have eaten here 3 times in the past month!!  My kids think it is just as good as it was before, however I am on the divorce diet and can not taste anything.  So this review will be based off of their need to eat there once a week - literally.    They remember who we are.  The wait staff is awesome, always telling me how nice it is to have kids with manners (thank you, I try!) they know my kids know where the "special" chop sticks are, and let them get their own.  The cooks are great, throw fake food (sometimes real!)  at you, make lots of fire, and put on a good show!   If you are on a budget, go for lunch.  You get the same amount of food for 1/2 the price. Kids meals start at $8 - same for lunch and dinner.  It is like having a 2 hour baby sitter!!

This place is awesome!!! Lots of candy, lots of different soda. Don't come here looking for Pepsi or Coke. Here's the catch.. Yes it's overpriced. Why? Because they were BRILLIANT to open next to Ultra Star! Which lacks a variety of candy, and what they do have is also overpriced. So you can go to CVS, Frys or Safeway for the same candy at 1/2 the price - OR you can go here, because you forgot to stop on the way!!   The owner was working when we were in there and the kids had questions. She was super nice and super patient. Awesome!!

I didn't want to write a review, because I don't want everyone and their Uncles to start coming here! I like that I can call and make a same day appointment. I've been here many times and to other places like this. I never returned to the others. It speaks volumes that I travel from Surprise to come here! It's that good!! Only one other reflexology location I would give my business to, but they are in Napa. :(   They will be gentle or rough, if they are hurting you, you need to tell them. It isn't a traditional massage!!

Knock knock..  Who's there...  Donut... Donut who... Donut just read the reviews, eat one!   The drive thru is a little odd being in a strip mall. However it's a donut shop up here in Surprise. By the kids school, so I can drop them off and get a quick bite to eat on my way back home.

Pretty cool place!! Helpful employees, no pressure to buy anything. Which is nice when you are a parent of 3 kids. The store at Downtown Disney is a bit pushy and hands a lot of things over to kids. Which turns into survival of the fittest when you have a kid who wants a $100 Lego set. True story.   It was nice that the employee came over and told my son to "fill the bucket until it won't close. We tape the top on". My son was was afraid he was stealing if he took too many. Or that they would weigh the container like a salad bar! Not true either way. Chase was happy with his full to the top $7.95 bucket of Legos. I was happy... Until midnight hit and I was walking up the stairs in a Lego combat zone! Ouch! That review would be for my own house, not the Lego store!!   Overall, wonderful store for all ages of Lego lovers. Boys and girls, teens and adults. Prices are from low end to WTF it's a piece of plastic!! ;)

My parents used to take their dogs to Puppy Palace. Not anymore. Surprise Animal Hospital is the best.  Spanky loves coming here. They are super friendly and the place is clean as a whistle. (Never understood that analogy!) they lost Dudley recently and SAH was amazing during the while process. I could give them enough stars.   They are super busy, so if you want to bring your doggie in for servicing (lol!) make sure you schedule a week out. My dad didn't, brought Spanky back to PP and he was sick and had anxiety for a week after. That was the final straw for my family using PP.

I thought I left a review already Hhhmmm.. Ok. Great local mail center. It's nice to have right here since I hate going to the post office. Ugh. Snow Birds are coming back soon. They don't come to this side of town (well unless its Senior Movie Day!) so it's nice for us local residents to have a place to go, get in and out quick. Always with a smile.

Athena is AH-MAZ-ING!!! I'm so thankful for Yelp members helping me find her. I've had a hard time finding anyone to trust with my hair (all it takes us one mess up at Super Cuts!) since moving back from Napa. (where I was spoiled with salons!)   Athena listens to what you want. She is busy, but it's always 1 client at a time. I'd reccomend her to anyone and everyone. I told her what I wanted and she delivered - but made it 100% better.   I was there for close to 3 hours and she didn't rush, complain nothing. She loves what she does, and it shows. Love her!

We eat here often for many reasons.... 1, it's right around the corner! 2, it's good! The ribs... Omg! So yummy! 3,4,5,6 it's right around the corner!! Kids eat free on Tuesdays, make sure you call ahead to confirm, as it has changed in the past.   It's priced decent. You can get 4 ribs, 4 chicken tenders and fries for $10. That is enough to feed 2 kids or 2 adults if you are looking for something lite to eat.   Lots on the menu. The have drink specials on weekends and ladies nights.   By the amount of my check ins, you can tell I am a fan!!

When i first walked into uptown alley I was impressed, there was a good vibe and everything was colorful. Other than the fact that it was a Friday evening and it was packed there is plenty of to keep your self occupied. There is a bar and grill, a arcade, a 2 story lazer tag and obviouslly the bowling alley. My son did the laser tag and loved it, it was cheap and fun, wether it was you and 3 friends or 20 people you don't know it's fun. The food at the grill was ok, not the best food ever but it's just a reastraunt in a bowling alley. The arcade games are cool, there are lots of games I haven't seen before and touch screen games, I was impresses. Finally the lanes, they are new aged modern lanes and those ball return things with new. Screens and everything. There is also a area for adults only that has bowling and pool. All in all I give the bowling alley a 4/5 and I will probably be going back.

Took my kids and nieces here awhile back. It's like the are trying to bring a little bit of Scottsdale to Surprise. Upscale designer food with upscale designer prices.   Not good for kids, over priced. In a bowling alley you need options for kids - families. This isn't it. There should be something for them. The Alley is big enough to have a mom and pop diner among the mix.   Good for dates, couples, over 21 people. Good for those who want to spend $20 on a caesar salad and soda. Which the salad sucked. My bill was over $90 (not incl tip) for 3 adults and 3 kids, for lunch!

We have been with Cranmore carpets for everything from carpets to tile now my car! At first I was using one of those $20 special coupons that came in the mail, then I would notice after about a week or two that all of the stains and dirt were coming right back up to the surface. I have three kids who do not understand take your shoes off and leave them at the door. Plus all of their friends!!   Enter Cranmore carpets. As soon as I had them come out they went over everything. They were extremely thorough and would not leave until all of my questions were answered. Which again as a renter sometimes it feels like you're living in your parents house, and at the end of your lease term every single dollar counts on your deposit. LOL!! But with that being said, as a renter sometimes people before you have pets and I have a high allergy, so if there's any leftover hair, stains or anything I'm going be feeling the effects of it.   Anyways back to the carpet cleaning they do an amazing job and I will only recommend them and nobody else. And even some people that have said they would rather use the $20 flyers of come back and tell me that they should've listen to me the first time that you definitely get what you pay for. Easily five stars and if I can give more I would to Cranmore carpets.

5 stars for opening! We have been watching the building change from Chueys to Uncle Bears and were excited to see it open today!!   Minus 2 stars because it was a small opening. If we didn't drive by, we would have never known.   Overall it's a great place, great food. Cant even tell what was there before. Try to go in before the rest of the West Side knows they are open.   2 stars back for the overall experience from entrance, food, service and exit. For a total of 5 stars. Not many places get 5 stars för me.  ;)   The line was short, the staff was courteous. Which I LOVE! Nothing is worse than a new restrauant and the staff is impatient. Some of us need a little extra time to read the menu.   Excited to have a new place to eat in Surprise. give them a try. :)

Good Morning Coffee... I have a friend who's husband works in Marketing at Peet's Coffee in Seattle.  The ongoing joke finally came true (this joke was first told to me at least 9 years ago!) "One day Starbucks is going to be so big, you will order your coffee and go to the bathroom, inside the bathroom there will be another Starbucks in there"... Ok, much funnier in person, and when anyone else tells the joke!   Safeway Starbucks. The only thing I don't like is when I order a "Grande White Chocolate Mocha", they always ask if I want it hot... Im sorry, isn't there an iced version? If I wanted it iced I would have asked, and I didn't. So stream that bitch up and don't forget the whipped cream.. :0)

When you don't want to deal with Peter Piper... You drive your kids 30 minutes down Litchfield and come to Chucks. Added bonus - free tokens for military. I didn't have my ID on me, but I did have my dog tag, and that was good enough. We didn't get a police discount - not that it mattered, but once we saw the military token offer we figured we'd shoot for the gold and ask that too! Score one for Mommy minus one for Officer Bill!    Games were clean and worked. Tubes were clean which is nice. Tables were clean. Bathrooms were clean. Basically it was clean all around. I like that each game takes only 1 token. Prizes are good for the kids. Something for everyone no matter how many or less tickets they earn. (Collin 600 - Chase 44)   It was a bit $$ even with a coupon. Which you can show from your phone. So google coupons before you go in. It was $55 for 2 lg pizzas, 5 drinks and 120 tokens.

Remember back when we were kids you used to get 2 pizzas on a huge sheet of cardboard then it  was covered in paper? Split it with a friend for $5.00, including crazy bread!!  Fast forward 20 years and now you average about $20 for 2 pizzas, 1 crazy bread and a 2 liter. Pizza tastes the same, the recipe hasn't changed a bit. Should have invested in Little Caesars Pizza!   This location is new, it's where Fresh and Easy was built 3 plus years ago and never opened. Same little random shopping center. It gets busy, but we have never had to wait for pizza. The great thing about fast food pizza, it's always ready.   Coincidently, if you want real pizza, Barros is right up the road a few miles and for the same $20 you can get 2 large pizzas there. Or 1 large and 12 wings. :)

Just opened. Get in fast to get the best of the products that they have. Store is clean, employees are nice. It's new! Give it until Christmas to be a disaster much like WalMart next door.

You can pay your APS and COX bill here. You can also pay your APS at Best Buy and one more location - I just can't remember what it was. Is recommend that due to long lines this time of year.

Brand new. Just opened. Clean and put together nice. I'm sure the items will be better here than the West Valley seeing its in Scottsdale.   Busy parking lot. Come early. Usually Thursdays are the stock days.

I've been getting coffee here since they opened years ago. Same employees all of these years, even though its in Safeway- that's pretty cool. Coffee is standard, prices are high. $10 for 2 grande mochas. Only Starbucks... :/

Welcome Five Guys!!!! Great choice for a location - as there is a Fudruckers right across the street, that sucks.   It's next to Paradise (also new) in a strip mall setting. The location is huge, clean, organized. Outdoor seating, shade, lots of tables, and great service.   The only downside, and this is for all locations, the decor is too close to In-N-Out. Not something to count against a star being deducted.   I gave them 4 not 5 stars because they are new and have kinks to work out. Yet have to be open for awhile to really "wow" people. When you have so many dining selections in the Arrowhead Mall area, you need to have somethin that makes me and other ppl say "dinehere"..   They use real meat, not processed. Fry orders are huge, always a ton to take home. The seasoned fries is basically similar to the stuff they have at Red Robin or Chuys (for the chips). It's good.   Overall a good burger. Yum!

AMAZED that Surprise would finally catch up with the rest of the world and open up Einstein Bagels here!!   It so nice and clean. I haven't seen any decline at Paradise Bakery just over the road, however not many people know these awesome guys are here. Once that happens, hold onto your bagels and lox!   My only worry is that the little mom and pop bagel / deli literally 50 yards away will feel the pinch and close. (Next to Starbucks across from Bank of America)   All and all. Check them out if you have never been!

Considering its sonic and it's a fast food place it ok, the food isnt bad at all but what I go there for is the sonic blasts and the slushies. I get the butterfinger sonic blast and it is amazing, I also get the strawberry slush and it is way different than any regular slushie, I'm not a fan of slushies but sonic does it right. I also walk by there every day around 6:30 to check out the firefighters that get dinner there. So all in all it a good place.

Its so good!! We had pulled pork, ribs and brisket for our meats. The cheesy potatoes were to die for! They are new, they run out of food so get there early! I am all for small business/ shop local, and supporting the community. The one complaint I heard was they use store bought buns, big deal! We go there for the meat, not the buns!! The manager, Ricky even went around table to table asking everyone how their dinner was. From what we overheard, every single customer was raving and are mostly repeat customers!  Glad we have a new place to eat at!! Try the cheesecake too! You wont be disappointed!!
