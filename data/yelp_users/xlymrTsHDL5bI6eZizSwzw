If you are a self employed person the bar side scene is gold. Great way to meet other quality people and naturally network. Decent food.

Jerry is the best masseur I've found in Scottsdale. ME can be hit or miss, and the trick is finding a good masseur. For deep tissue, I would spend a year trying to find someone as good. Highly recommend if sports and athletic massage is what ya want.

I spent 25 minutes reading reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try.  Mistake.  I wish I'd tried somewhere else for dry cleaning.  I got ready to wear my favorite shirt out and discovered it had all kinds of stains on it (that amazingly weren't there before!).  A friend and I had planned our clothing to match for a special night so it was a scramble to change everything because the shirt was a mess.  It hadn't occurred to me it would return dirtier than I gave it to them, so I hadn't checked it beforehand.  If you try here, I highly recommend checking all of your clothes before leaving the store.  More than that, I highly recommend exploring somewhere else.

Prepare to make love to your food.  The tom kah Kai soup -- the flavors are so complimentary. So distinct. I could eat this almost daily. You must get at least a cup. I split a cup with a friend and it was perfect.  Had the drunken noodles with soft shell crab. Was good but I was almost more surprised by how not in love I was. It was ok. Good but I would definitely get something else next time.

This used to be my favorite place to watch UFC. Then new management took over and food quality stood in the high dive and jumped off. The burgers - previously very good- are garbage. Gone is the quality cheese. Enter the crappy Kraft slices in plastic wrap. Think McDonalds and you won't be disappointed. Campbell's soup is better. Honestly. The dessert we tried was the saving grace. Our server was great - very on point. Overall we will probably not come back.

Eric isn't good - he is like the ninja of men's haircuts. I'm pretty new to town and one of the top Yelp'ers recommended Eric. It's the the best haircut I've had in years. Lets put it this way; if you get a haircut and don't think it's amazing, I would refund what you paid (up to $45) out of my own pocket. He's that good. If you want a stylish men's haircut you have to try Eric out. I can't imagine he wouldn't be the best haircut you can find.

Success!!! Found a Thai place I really like.  Ordered 3 dishes: Rama noodles with chicken: 5 stars--peanut sauce was so good I used the vegetables to scrape it all up. The noodles - and I rarely like noodles - we awesome. Loved them! Ate it all. And for the money...! Pad pik with beef:  4 stars -- great vegetables. Light sauce. Beef wasn't the best but overall very good.  Fried rice with crab: 3 stars -- good fries rice but if we ordered it again we would get a different type of meat. Wasn't bad but far from memorable.  Good service. Very reasonable price especially for the quality.  Overall: happy and satisfied and will definitely return!

They have some great comedy here -- fun stuff.  I had the filet salad, which I have to say was not impressive at all, but for $15, the value was on par with the price.  The service was decent - better than I expected given how many people were in the place!  Overall, it was fun and I would come back.

This is my favorite coffee location, second to LGO.  Truly awesome atmosphere and scene.  A lot of self employed and salespeople bring clients here.  Lots of non-pretentious business people getting business done.  I've not tried the food but been told it's spectacular.  Whereas LGO is more informal, The Henry has a classier feel.  Highly recommend.
