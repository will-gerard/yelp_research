Food is okay and worth the price for the quality served. I would have given more stars if the customer service was better. The waiter kept messing up our orders and when we spoke up to correct it, she would scowl behind our backs walking back.... Come here if you want mediocre sushi. But I don't think I would recommend this place to my friends and family.

Excellent food. The chicken Marsala is amazing. Excellent wine selection and excellent customer service. Perfect place for a date or get together with friends for those of you who love exquisite Italian cuisine.

Got my extensions and balayage done here, and I love it. Denise is highly skilled, sweet, and knows exactly what I wanted. I'll be a regular here for sure. I love that this salon is able to do a wide range of styles and I can be confident that I will leave here loving my hair.
