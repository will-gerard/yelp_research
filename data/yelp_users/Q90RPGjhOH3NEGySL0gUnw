Menu items never change  SOME not all servers just seem to stand around doing nothing but bringing food out and above taking plates back leaving it entirely to bus boys  Consistency of food is lacking (poached eggs one day boiled another)  We only come here now when other friends convince us  I forgot to mention this part, the drinks are usually good when they do finally come out, and when made right the food is excellent and ingredients always seem fresh...

Revisited  a weeks ago, happy to report that the food was more consistent and service was improved...  had eggs Benedict and they were indeed what you would expect...

I couldn't get to try the coffee without getting towed from their parking lot while going to the ATM across the street.  Coffee was ok but being charged $155 for a tow while getting money across the street on a very not busy Thursday night is just not worth even trying to go back.   Not ever going back for a $5 mediocre coffee.  They could have the best coffee in the world but too bad you can't park there.

The food is good however the portion sizes are extremely small.   I would pay $1.99 per taco not $3.95... the atmosphere is good but not worth the price for the portion size...  Probably will not be back any time soon with so many options for tacos in Phoenix!!!
