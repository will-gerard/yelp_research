Outstanding place! Great food and tap beers. All the food is great. I love the burgers and of course the steak sandwich. NY strip on great bread. Great meal for the price point.  Best steak sandwich I've ever had!

This the worst place.  I sat down was not greeted and waited forever to place my order.  Would not go back.  And it was not that busy. Then my eggs were cold!
