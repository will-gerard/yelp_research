Good food for very good prices! The portions are generous, and you also get a soup and/or salad (depending on lunch or dinner). The service is good too. Will definitely return!

Very good prices for food, and it's great! Wonderful service as well. I also love their selections of breads, meats, cheeses, etc, etc!  Some of the items in the store (not on the menu) are a bit overpriced. Also, when I have taken my sandwich home, it didn't last very long and wasn't nearly as good as it was in the restaurant.

Very delicious food! It is great for a dinner spot, as the meals are quite heavy. The portions were huge as well! Romantic ambiance and great staff. Will return again when in the mood for a big, yummy meal!

Service would normally be better here, but our server was either a bit confused or couldn't hear us? We had some problems communicating with him sometimes.  The mussels were good, and the desserts we had were good as well.  The seafood salad was very bland, and the cioppino was just okay.  All in all, we wouldn't jump to return.

Great place!!  Very friendly service. Everyone was so nice. This place is very clean, and it has a nice, casual atmosphere.  The rolls are outstanding!  We ordered the lobster bisque, scallops, and coq au vin. Everything was excellent. The salads with the entrees were great as well. Wish we had time for dessert, but we unfortunately had a prior engagement.  We will definitely return!

Wonderful service! These restaurants seem to be known for that. Our server was fantastic!  Loved the French Dip here (as always!). Theirs is the best I have had! We all ordered it at our table except for one person ordered the veggie burger, and he is still talking about it a week later. Yummy brownie dessert as well!

Wonderful service and delicious food!! Our waiter was very knowledgeable about each item we asked about, and our water glasses were always filled without asking. We ordered the lobster bisque, beet & goat cheese salad, rack of lamb, lobster w/basil pasta, pumpkin creme brulee, and chocolate hazelnut cake. Everything we ate was delicious and fresh and very carefully prepared. Loved the complimentary flourless chocolate cake at the end. Yum! This place is somewhat pricey ($32+ for entrees), but it's a great place for a special night out! Make sure to ask for the original room - very cozy!

Amazing croissants as always! I liked the feel of the place. The menu had great options, and I liked that there were many specials as well. We got the cheese ravioli and the shrimp crepes. Both were good! Our favorite was the corn and avocado spread on top of the crepes. The prices were great!

Had a decent experience here for my fiance's birthday. We loved the ambiance, but our service was not good. Our server took forever to come to our table, and about half of what we ordered got messed up. Then when they brought out the dessert, they wrote the wrong name on it. I received a call from the manager the following week, and he apologized and said he was going to send us something. He never did. It's been 10 months.

Very friendly service and so inexpensive for pedicures! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed relaxing here.  The only negative is that I wish they had a bit more of a selection of nail polishes. Also, they ask that we don't use credit cards.

Awful customer service from everybody there (including the post office people). Very rude, inconsiderate, and unhelpful.  The prices are not good.  It is a pain to return anything here.  We live just a few blocks away, so it is unfortunate that we can no longer go to this store. However, after numerous visits (we kept trying to give them more 'second' chances), we have come to the conclusion that it is just better to go to Home Depot a couple miles away.  Our advice is to go to Home Depot just two miles up the road at Tatum and Bell. The prices are better, the customer service is friendly, and the return policy is great!

Very nice service here, but the food was NOT good. We had multiple items from the menu, and none of it was good. The decor is somewhat depressing.  All in all, it made us wish we were eating Chinese in San Fran.

This place is FAR away! We came here to pick our own produce. The place was swarming with weeds! They said that it was because of the recent rains, but come on!  We did get some great beets, and we walked around the large farm. It was quite dead while we were there (a Thursday in March), but we know there can be a lot going on here during festivals, etc. The animals were fun to look at, but I think some of them needed grooming. They were way too hot being outside!  All in all, we would not come back here again except to maybe try out the festivals (Peach Festival maybe).

I have always enjoyed Benihana! The food is very good for the price you pay, and I just love how I am able to eat a bit of everything while I'm there. We have had some great chefs too.  The only thing is that some of the servers have been a bit slow before. Otherwise, this place is great!

Had a great visit at Dr. Cohen's! He made me feel comfortable and was very talkative. We had great, smooth conversation, and Dr. Cohen was interested in my life and what I do. He is a great listener and a happy guy! The office visit was quick, and he described what he was doing throughout the process. We also had a few good laughs!  Dr. Cohen's staff was friendly and personable, and I was seen quickly. The office is very clean and welcoming.  Would definitely return to Dr. Cohen!

Eh, this place is not good. The food isn't fresh, and it just plain tastes bad. It is far too pricey for how mediocre it is. The service is also not so good, and the servers can be a bit unfriendly.  The only time I would ever come here is when my friends want to go here (even then, I try to tell them not to go!). The happy hour can be okay, but I would definitely rather go somewhere else!

We are IN LOVE with this place!!! We even took family here when they came from out of town. We are big produce buyers (don't buy much processed foods), and this place has amazing prices and quality of produce. If you are a healthy eater and eat mainly non-processed foods, I would HIGHLY recommend this place. It's nice and airy and not cramped at all. The staff is always very helpful!

I have been going to Great Skate since I was a little girl. It's SO fun going back to this place as an adult! I love the fun music, lights, and games! It's nice that they offer deals a lot on daily deal sites too.  I am not a huge fan of the skating 'sessions', but it seems like most skating-type places have these sessions now.

Very great prices for what you get! We got the BBQ chicken sandwich, spring rolls, fried rolls, and a beef & brisket soup. We wish they had peanut sauce for the spring rolls. Also, the soup didn't have as many veggies as the menu seemed to say it had.   We will for sure be back though!

Fun atmosphere and very good service. We liked all of the sports memorabilia. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and patient. The busboys were also very attentive and friendly. We especially were glad to have been given good service even though we did not order any beverages (you'd be surprised at how many servers are rude to us after they discover that we won't be ordering alcohol).  Food was good! We enjoyed: the bread, sweet and sour cabbage soup, caesar salad, baby back ribs, salmon, mashed potatoes, and creme brulee. The chopped liver at the beginning of the meal was also a nice bonus!  Only cons would be that the french fries were mundane. Also, we were a little confused about what was a part of the meal (sides, soups, etc), what was an upcharge, what we couldn't add, etc. It wasn't outlined on the menu, and our server had to explain a couple of times.  The manager came by after to ask how everything was. Very nice!

I have found some fabulous things here, and I recommend it to anybody who is okay with shopping for consignment clothing. I have gotten numerous compliments on some of the items I got at My Sister's Closet, and I am excited to come here each time I decide to go!  The minor downsides - I have had a problem finding good jeans here. Also, I have encountered some issues with unfriendly staff. Although, there have also been some very friendly people here as well.  Overall, it's a great store, and you can get some awesome deals!

Make sure to sit at the chef's table. It's quite an experience! Here you sit at the bar facing the kitchen and the chef himself, Razz! They bring you small plates (priced at $10 a plate) until you tell them to stop. Both times we went, we stopped after 4 courses and then had the dessert (which was $20 for the shared plate and consisted of 3 "slices" of different desserts). I'd say the best part of the meals are the sauces - absolutely amazing! We made sure to have bread on hand to soak it all up. Each course is different from the next, and all of it is scrumptious! If you want a quicker meal, I'd say to get an earlier seating (6pm), as we were out in an hour. Last time, I believe we had an 8pm seating, and it was more crowded by then. Enjoy!

Very good service! Each person working there helped out at our table (and there were only two of us)! We ordered the prosciutto starter and the margarita pizza with mushrooms. The starter was pretty good, but the pizza and mushrooms were excellent! We got our food very fast, and we were seated right away as well. Really like the set up of the place and the building. Quaint but very cool!  If you park in the Heritage garage, they will validate your pass, and your parking is then free for the first hour.

We had a burger and the Asian shrimp dish, and both were not good. some of the prices were reasonable, but some were definitely overpriced. The drinks are super expensive too! Other friends at our table also thought that the food was not very good.  The ambiance is very Scottsdale-ish, so you do need to be in that sort of mood to be here.  Our server was friendly.

Very friendly service, delicious food, and cheap prices! What more can you ask for? We have taken every out-of-towner to this place to eat, and they all have loved the food, decor, and friendly staff. They are great about giving samples of about 6 different items from the menu, and they help fill out your order card as well. Everything tastes really fresh, and they have a ton of options. They're also great about substituting items as well. Definitely a must-visit!

Excellent food and service. We never order wine or alcohol at high-end restaurants, as we are not drinkers. Fleming's is one of the only places that does not treat us poorly after discovering that our bill will only include food (hey, we're great tippers!).  The food is incredible, and the staff is very respectful, polite, and friendly. We just love coming back to Fleming's over and over again!

Cool ambiance. We like the live music too! The heaters outside were great.  The portions were huge! Our least favorite part of the meal was the mussels appetizer. We wouldn't order that again. We ordered the pork and short ribs. The short ribs were great! Our sides were the mashed potatoes, green beans, creamed corn, and the cornbread. We liked them all except the green beans were just okay. We also ordered a sundae for dessert, which was huge!

So many different flavors of gelato! It was so fun to try them all. And there was such a variety as well! I liked the ambiance of the place - it felt a bit like Italy.  My milkshake was a bit milky and lost the flavor of the gelato. But I would still return and maybe just choose a stronger flavor or ask for less milk. Otherwise, it was great!!

The service here was very friendly and fast.  We ordered the brie appetizer, which was very good.  The salmon entree was a little fishy and overcooked. The spinach ravioli was just okay - the sauce was decent.  The sundae for dessert was good as well.   All in all, we had a decent meal, but we would have been happier if we didn't have to pay as much for the food. It isn't quite worth the price.

The food was okay, but it is way overpriced for what it is. The server was not very friendly, and she wasn't attentive.  If that wasn't bad enough, I ended getting FOOD POISONING from this place! When I called to let them know about it the next day, the hostess brushed it off and said that they never have gotten any complaints about food poisoning before. She didn't offer me anything; she didn't apologize.  I already would never have returned to Sushi Brokers after the meal, but after realizing that this place gave me food poisoning, and after they were so nonchalant about it, I don't ever want to see or think of this place again!

Eh, this place is not too good. I definitely wouldn't choose to return here.  The food is just OK, which makes it way overpriced for what it is. Nothing on the menu is special or unique. We also felt like our stomachs were carrying huge bricks after we ate here.  Our server was also rude and not very attentive. His mind seemed to be somewhere else the entire time, and it seemed like he didn't want to be there at all.

Very fun cooking class. It was great to meet new people and hang out and cook for a few hours!  They offered soda, wine, or beer with dinner, which was nice. They people working there were also very on the ball with filling up our drinks.  Everything was very tidy, clean, and organized. It was very welcoming! Also, the appliances and cooking utensils were very nice.  We made margarita pizza, focaccia  bread (from the same dough as the pizza sauce), Caesar salad, chicken Parmesan, and a citrus pound cake. Everything was very good!  It was fun to make the dishes and pick and choose what you want to do. The only thing is that a few of the helpers were not on the same page about the recipes. We sometimes needed a little more direction than we got. However, they were very helpful with what we needed when we asked.  It was so nice to have everyone serve us in the end. We were able to relax and enjoy our food!

We have been here for dinner and brunch once and for lunch multiple times. Each meal was fabulous! Our favorites are brunch and lunch - such wonderful flavors and fresh food! We always make sure to order different items, so we can try everything!  Christopher is very kind and attentive, and it is obvious that he really takes pride in this place. We love how beautiful the restaurant is, both inside and on the patio.  This is definitely one of the places we go to when we have out-of-towners here. We will continue to come here many times over!

The food here was very good and fresh! We were able to try multiple things off of the menu - guacamole, soup, white bean side, salads, and tacos. We just loved the decor of this place! All the leather was beautiful.  We knocked it down a star because: the server could have been better. While he wasn't awful, we think he was a bit snooty because we didn't order alcohol. Also, the tacos order was TINY! It was almost a joke! But, everything was very good.

LOVE the raised garden as you walk into this place. It's so wonderful to see the food you will be eating! Everything looked so great.  We had the make your own pizza w/mushrooms and grilled veggies. Pretty good! Very good for the price too...just $8 total. There were also options to add basil, garlic, rosemary, etc, for free! Also, we shared a salad that was really good...the chicken was great!  It's a bit hard to see from Camelback, but it's worth it once you find it! The place was PACKED for lunch on a Wednesday. I guess that says it all!

I cannot stop saying wonderful things about Dr. Parsanko and his office! This is by far the best dentist experience I have ever had, and I do not want to go anywhere else! The office is beautiful and clean. It's very high tech!  Dr. Parsanko is caring, professional, honest, and overall a wonderful person and dentist. I trust him completely! He has never tried to up-sell me, and he has been truthful about everything. When I had a chipped tooth, his pricing was fair, and he was upfront about the process. He explained everything he was doing while he was doing it and made me feel very comfortable.  Thanks so much, Dr. Parsanko!

We absolutely love hiking here! There are tons of trails, and many of them are very easy to access - not to far away from Scottsdale. While you are close to the city, it definitely feels like you are far away. The trails are varying lengths and difficulties, which is great! You can also see plenty of wildlife while hiking here. The views of the sunset are also very incredible!

Very good food! We ate some shrimp tacos and macaroni and cheese. They split our tacos up for us and didn't charge for it...the portions were great too!  Our server was friendly as well. Would definitely return!

We really like this place! The food has always been delicious. We have even started buying packages of lavosh from them. We love eating healthy here.  The only drawback so far has been the service, which has so far been just so-so.

Kinda sad that this place hasn't had a plain tart flavor both times we've been here. However, the yogurt is pretty decent. We'd definitely choose other yogurt places nearby over this one, but since we have had a coupon both times, we didn't mind coming here.  The toppings were quite good. We had the heath bar and gummy bears.  The first time we came here, the guy working there was very friendly! However, this past time, the girl at the counter was quite bland and didn't seem interested in talking to anybody about the flavors.

I have been going to Prestige for my pedicures for quite some time now, and every visit has been great! The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and they have tons of nail polishes to choose from. The salon is very clean and taken care of, and I love how bright and happy it is in there! There has never been a wait, so we get seated right away. Also, all of my pedicures have lasted much longer than any other one I have gotten.

The food was just eh. I only ordered a bean and cheese burrito, but it was just satisfactory.  The service was the worst part about this place. Our server, for some reason, was extremely rude to us the entire time we were there. She rolled her eyes at us a few times, and was very quick to respond (and at times didn't respond at all). The only time she said something halfway friendly was just before we were about to write in our tips. Go figure.  We won't be returning.

We returned again after the owner reached out to us to apologize about our previous experience there. This time around, our server Eric was wonderful. He was very attentive and friendly and everything came out quickly as well.  Between the four of us, we ordered drinks (great margaritas!), the trio chip appetizer, tacos, and sopapillas. All of the food was very good.  The prices here are excellent. Our total bill was very inexpensive for all that we ordered. This is a fun hangout spot!

Very creative food options for those who are vegetarian, vegan, raw, etc. Love that they are organic and make everything fresh! Many many options as well. Love the feel of the place! The vegan cheesecake was so delicious! That was our favorite! Love to support healthy, local places!

Loved the presentation of the food. Everything was so unique! We had a nice view outside as well. Our server was friendly even after we only had water for a beverage.  We had the lobster bisque, filet, short ribs, a side of mashed potatoes, and the creme brulee dessert. Everything was great! The creme brulee had a bit too much of an alcohol taste to it.  Oh, and the bread given at the beginning was delicious!!!

I would give this place more stars if the prices were lower or the food was better. Unfortunately, expensive prices for mediocre food is not for me.  We tried 5 dishes here, and neither of us were excited about any of them. The calamari was bland and rubbery, the patatas (although cooked very well) were doused in too much sauce, and the cheese croquettes were just okay. The filet was the best thing we ordered, and it was pretty good. The creme brulee dessert was not very good.  Our server was very friendly, but the server for nearby tables was quite loud and annoying.  All in all, I would have been pretty happy if our food cost half as much as it did.

Very fun place to watch some comedy! We enjoyed all the acts here, and the layout of the place is great too.  The food and drinks were also good, and they were reasonably priced. Our waitress did mess up our order once, and she also mixed up the credit cards on the bills. Other than that, we had a great time, and we would definitely return!

This place sucks! They have lost or ruined multiple things now, and all they do is offer half the price of what you purchased the item for and the other half of the price in "store credit." This is also only after we have to repeatedly call to see what the status is of our lost/ruined item.   Who would want to go back to this place after they have messed up so much?!

Our server was great! He was on the ball and friendly, and he did not judge us when we didn't order drinks!  The shrimp & clam soup was very good. The small deserts were pretty good - definitely a great size. I wish though that they offered other options besides the small individual servings.  Our entrees were bland. In order to stay under the 475 calorie rule, they have skimped on many spices/additions that make meals so tasty! Also, the filet was very large - I would have rather had a smaller cut with more taste!  We will not be going back on our own, however, if someone we are meeting would like to go there, then we will not complain.

Our second experience here was much better. We knew to stay away from the traditional fattier foods and stuck with healthier options. We had:  - Mussels appetizer  - Stuffed mushrooms appetizer  - Chicken flatbread  - Salmon  - Scallops  Everything had quite a bit of flavor and was prepared well. We would return again!

Really like how the food is fresher and healthier! It's also very light, and you do not leave feeling too full or sick! The mushroom pizza is delicious, and the lettuce wraps are pretty good. Also, the desserts are tasty.  It is a bit pricey for what you get however - I am not a big eater, and I ate the lettuce wraps and pizza on my own without feeling that full. It's nice to feel good after the meal, but I wish the prices were slightly cheaper. Maybe it's to cover the costs of the better ingredients?

Used a Groupon here, and it was a great experience! The express mani/pedi wasn't express at all - they took their time with me, and everything felt great!  The woman who did my pedicure was fantastic. My toes and feet look wonderful!  The woman who did my manicure was pretty good. The only issue is that she accidentally cut my thumb. When it bled a little, she just painted over it. It's now been a few days, and my thumb still hurts.   Overall, it was a good experience though, and the staff was very friendly! I would return for sure.

The staff was friendly. That's about the only thing that was good about this place.  The frozen yogurt was not good. The people working there also didn't know what active cultures were. There was also hardly any seating inside the place.  We will not be returning, especially since there are so many other great frozen yogurt places in Scottsdale.

I had a very good experience here and found my dress in one visit.  My particular dress that I chose did not appear to have any tears, stains, etc, but this may have been because it just came in. A few of the other dresses I looked at though did have some issues, but you should know before you come in that they are off the rack, so that is why you are getting a discount.  The woman who worked with me was great and really helped me with my indecisiveness. I ended up leaving with a dress I love!

We were here for happy hour and enjoyed a few of their spring rolls. We very much enjoyed a couple of them! One or two were just okay. But, at the happy hour prices, we were able to eat a good number without breaking the bank! Cute location and nice atmosphere. Really liked the laid back feel!

Really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Nice and laid back! We enjoyed our food; it was very fresh.  I had the soup. I was told it was a black bean chili, but it seemed to be some sort of a tortilla soup. It was very spicy! I enjoyed it for a bit, but then it ended up being a little spicy for me overall.  The country vegetable chop salad was very good. My favorite part was the breaded brussel sprouts (a nice surprise!).

I have been here twice now, and the service was great both times.  Just had some of their cookies & mint and their butter pecan ice creams....YUM! They were absolutely delicious. You can tell that the ice creams were homemade.  The first time I went, I just got a rice krispy treat. It was a bit disappointing, as it was somewhat hard (I like them soft and gooey!). But, it was the end of the day, so they may have been made much earlier. This is the only reason why I knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars.

I would probably give this place 3.5 stars.  I am rounding up to 4 stars because the prices are much more reasonable that other "dinner movie theaters." Also, the service is friendly and fast, and the menu options are pretty good. The food also seems a bit cheaper than other similar places.  The food however isn't amazing. It seems to be slightly better than other places we have been to, and they are somewhat generous with their portions. While some of the seating is more normal, regular chairs, there are also seating options that are office chairs. They are comfortable ones, but at times it can be a bit awkward when you swivel into your neighbor or try to get comfortable.  I will continue to go here though for this type of experience, as the prices are so reasonable. It's also very clean!

Very fun way to enjoy sushi and other Japanese dishes! Every table has the opportunity to grab dishes coming by, and they are all priced at $5 or less (although nobody at our table got an item over $3). So, the prices are very reasonable! Our server was also very attentive and friendly. This is a great place to go if you are trying to satisfy your sushi craving!  It's a little set off from the street, so it can be a bit difficult to find. Worth the find though!

Would probably give it 2.5 stars, but decided to round down due to being let down by this place.  We were happy to hear of a healthy restaurant opening up, but we won't be going back.  We came during their grand opening and completely understand that it would be busy. However, we waited over 45 minutes in line. Once we got to the front, we knew why we waited. The staff was very disorganized. Everybody seemed to be doing all of the jobs and moving all over the place. They were moving very slow as well. The guy that took our order didn't give us any info on what to order or how to order. The only thing he told us what that they were "out of avocados." We ordered our food (only 3 items total between the two of us). Once we got to the front, they made us repeat everything we ordered (again, no organization). And they forgot our one smoothie we ordered. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get the smoothie, which was supposed to come to our table. Instead, we had to go to the front to ask about it. The food was just okay or very bland. We didn't add meat to our orders, so maybe that is why? But they should be able to offer decent vegetarian options. Heck, we make a better kale salad at home than what their kale caesar was. And their fiesta bowl seemed to be missing something, as it was very bland. The smoothie was good though. Luckily the grand opening was 50% off. We would never return here for full price, as it's definitely a rip-off.  Again, we love the idea of this place. We love fresh, local, organic produce. And we love decent vegetarian options. But so far, this place just doesn't cut it.

We returned here this past week, as the owner reached out to us to extend his apologies for their very busy grand opening. They really did have a ton of people there that day!  We got the fiesta bowl again, and it was so much more flavorful. We also got the salmon salad wrap, and that was very good as well. The smoothie was great (as it was last time too).  The service was much quicker and more on the ball, and the staff was friendlier. The place also has a great vibe!  We saw a good number of people coming in as we were there, and we were glad to see it, as we love seeing people making healthy choices when they eat. Organic is also a plus!  It is so nice to meet an owner who really cares about his business and wants to improve upon each aspect of it. We would definitely give this place an A++ for customer service!
