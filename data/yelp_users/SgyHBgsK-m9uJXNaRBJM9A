Pros: clean, quick, delicious, friendly, good prices.  Cons: Closed on Saturdays and Sundays.   I love the fried gyoza and a california roll. Can't beat that for lunch, not even with a stick! Okay, maybe with a stick, but you probably wouldn't want to eat it afterwards.

This is probably the worst Ulta when it comes to customer service. I am not a needy customer and more often than not I prefer to be left alone to do my shopping. However, I do appreciate being acknowledged and I am even more a fan of having my questions answered in the event that I do need some assistance. This is not the case at this location. The salesgirls seem unfriendly and completely uninterested in helping/recommending/selling. I honestly wonder if being as unhelpful as possible is part of their job description. If it is, then they are doing stellar!

Mmmmmmmmmm. So many good things to say about this place. The staff is friendly and extremely attentive, the ambiance is relaxed, the menu offers plenty of choices, the portions are filling, and the price is just right. The only thing I dislike about Mi Patio is that the cups they use for the Margaritas are so deceiving! You THINK you are getting a lot, but in actually the cups don't hold a whole lot. Guess I can't complain too much about a $1.75 cold Margarita, though! This place is great for Happy Hour or a quick lunch. If it wasn't 2 in the morning I'd run there right now for chips and salsa and some tasty shredded beef tacos.

This place is a sweet dive. I've never been here on a busy night, but I do know that its a good place to enjoy cheap drinks  and edible bar food after work.

An ex boyfriend of mine introduced me to this place and I can tell you that's the best thing he ever did for me. Yup, this place is a total dive. Do not be afraid to get out of your car as you maneuver your way into the parking lot. Nestled in between a sheisty Circle K and an Adult Shoppe (or something) Angie & Jimmie's will NOT disappoint. If you're in the mood for some tasty slices of pizza or wings, this is the place for you. Truth be told,  I'm not really a fan of their sandwiches because they have too much meat on them for my liking (but others might see this as an endearing quality in a sub sandwich.) Oh and whatever you do, don't forget to grab a cannoli...or six! Or twenty seven.

Urban Cookies, you had me at hello!   So many traditionally flavoured tasty treats to chose from! They're also into experimenting with new flavours quite often so one never knows what marvelous concoctions await.  I've never had a bad cupcake from this place and the cookies are even more amazing. Some my favourite cupcakes include: the classic, the lemon, and the coconut. As far as cookies go I lean towards the dark chocolate walnut and the snickerdoodle.   They are a little pricey for some people but once you take the first bite you will know why.   If you like them on Facebook they frequently post the "word of the day" for half off treats. Also, if you use the app Belly Urban Cookies is one of the participating merchants and you can earn points to get some sweet freebies.

Love going to Kobalt on Thursdays for Trivia Night. The competition is fierce (but I think some of them cheat...smart phones I'm looking at you!)! Can't tell you how many times we've been SO CLOSE to winning...then don't. Trivia Night is definitely good for groups if you're looking to laugh, have some drinks, and eat some complimentary popcorn.  Gina, who hosts Trivia Night,  is a riot and a master on the bar. The only downside is sometimes Kobalt is pretty dead and you're stuck having to make polite conversation with that weird bar person who just can't take a hint that they should go away. However, that doesn't make the drinks or the company (that you came with) any less enjoyable!

This place is OKAY. Based on all the hype and the price, I guess I expected more. A lot more? The food was decent and far from memorable. Their pomegranate margarita is good, but it came in the world's tiniest cup...it may have even been a thimble, I'm not sure. America's Taco Shop is still a cool spot in the valley and I appreciate that it's there, but in Phoenix where Mexican food places are everywhere you look, this will never be a priority stop for me. I'd rather eat the tacos from the Cocina at the 16th Street and Roosevelt Ranch Market. Really.

I've never had a bad time at SideBar! Conveniently located above a Pei Wei, this is a chill place to drink, people watch, and enjoy in conversation with friends or strangers. The  bartenders are friendly and their pours are solid. Sometimes the night starts off someplace else but we often find our way back to trusty ol' Sidebar, where good times are meant to be had. I love watching people drink the Absinthe for the first time, the wretched looks of agony never get old.

This is still my favourite Zipps even though the new one on Bethany is closer. Walk into this Zipps any time and you instantly feel welcomed and comfortable, is it me or is the one on Bethany sort of douchebaggy? Anyway, they have awesome specials during their Happy Hour- especially love that the specials are different every night of the week. Must try the Zipparitas! I'm glad they only serve you 3, trust me, its plenty! Also can't go wrong with the buffalo wings or skewers, or the $1.50 slices of pizza. Oh, Zipps, you complete me! I choo-choo-choose you.

I purchased a Living Social Deal to attend an event here with a friend. I have been to other painting classes around the valley, so I was pretty comfortable with the concept already.  The class I attended was the close up of the fish and the instructor was Robert.   First thing, I love that the location was easy to find and there was ample parking because our class was early on a Sunday. The art studio/gallery is very nicely decorated and it is very roomy. I love the high ceilings and the ceiling fans. Very comfortable! The stools seemed not sturdy enough to hold my weight but I was surprised that the lady who checked us in brought me a regular chair right away, without me having to ask.   The one thing that would make this place better is the sound. It can get loud with all of the other "artists" having their own conversations and the instructor was not wearing a microphone. At times, I felt lost during the instruction because I missed it due to not being able to hear what he was saying.   The atmosphere wasn't as laid-back/silly/engaging as it has been at other places, but it didn't take away from the experience.   I really enjoyed my experience and looking through the calendar I see lots of other paintings I want to try. I will definitely be coming back to Me the Artist in the near future!

I usually only come to Nami for dessert...their delicious Tsoynamis. Today, I came for the vegan Sunday brunch in honour of a friend's birthday. I tried the new special,  the Waffly Tamaffle and it was delicious! Will definitely be eating brunch here again.   Back to the desserts...  Tsoynamis are the perfect treat for any day! My favourites are the banana wafer flavour and the betterfinger. I'm not vegan, but I love it here, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit on the patios.   Sometimes parking can be a hassle if Green is too busy but it's worth it.   I've yet to try their vegan donuts, maybe next time!

I have converted from vegetarian to veganism since the time of my original review. Now I love Nami even more!  Favourite tsoynamis: PB & J, Banana Cream Pie, Lemonbar (when they have it!) and also the Funny Bunny that was around briefly in the spring.   If you follow them on Facebook or Instagram you can be lured to come in by their yummy photos, which happens to me on a regular basis.   I often meet non-vegan friends here and they've all loved it as well.

This is one of my favourite spots for rolls because I enjoy building my own custom creations. I'm not eating meat these days and they have a good selection of veggies and a few fruits to choose from.   My favourite roll is this:   Soy wrap  White rice Cucumber Avocado Mango Cream cheese Sprouts Spicy mayo Sriracha  I usually eat out in their patio or on the larger tables in that courtyard area. Everyone who works here is friendly and they make your rolls pretty fast. If a line forms, I notice they are very good about getting help other people on shift.  Totally recommend everyone who decides to eat here regularly ask to sign up for their loyalty prgram. I've earned many free rolls and am happily eating my way up to Rockin' Roller status!  My only complaint about HDYR is that at this location the tables are sometimes sticky if you chose to dine inside.

I heard about Señor Sushi through a friend, who was having a birthday dinner there. Imagine my surprise that in that same week, they were running a Groupon deal. When I first heard about where this place is located, I was initially hesitant, as I'm not a big fan of the West Side. (What can I say, Central Phoenix kind of girl!) Still, I gave it a try and I've been a fan ever since!  The inside is HUGE, I think at one point it may have been a sports bar of sorts. The decor is interesting, and it works. On Saturdays they play great music and there is a dance floor. During the week, I have not experienced DJed music. They also have a full bar and TVs that are usually playing soccer matches, football games, or whatever other sport is on at any given time. Any day of the week it seems like a pretty popular place and has been clean. There are always many diners, including large families, and an extensive amount of staff. The staff are extremely nice and accommodating. I have noticed that they continue to make improvements to the space and additions to their menu, so that's a good sign. On one particular visit there were musicians playing guitars from table to table and a lady was singing. Her voice is incredible!   The best things on their menu are, of course, the Latin Fusion rolls. Deep fried concoctions stuffed with different cheeses, avocados, etc? YES PLEASE! Upon first bite, I knew I was in love. These Latin Fusion rolls are ginormous. Prepare to stuff yourself into a happy oblivion. They also serve traditional rolls, but why order those when you can get those anywhere?  From the drink menu, they have outstanding Micheladas. For dessert? Fried ice cream, please! If you're into appetizers, I never order them anymore here because they rolls are just too filling, I recommend the stuffed jalapeños.   I've recommended this place to other people since I have discovered it and they've also loved it as well. Glad I gave it a chance! I don't know of any other Mexican Sushi place in the valley, nor have I ever had this type of cuisine anywhere else.

I went here for the first time on Saturday and I didn't like it. The place just does not have a good vibe. Staff members I encountered were nice and the performers were fun to watch, but other than that, this place feels like where dreams go to die. Maybe I don't understand the appeal. You also have to walk thru a crowd of smokers to get in or out.

First visited The Whining Pig on a Thursday, was back by Saturday. This is an amazing new place and I feel like I've been let into a secret society of craft beers, great service, and delicious cookies.  The atmosphere is super chill and comfortable.  The place is small, very small, but it still feels oh-so-right. They offer a great selection of beer and wine at incredible prices since the Happy Hour goes on from open-8pm! Greg, the owner and also the best bartender you may possibly ever encounter, is very knowledgeable about everything they pour. He also keeps a jar of chocolate handy and frequently shares it with all the patrons, which had me at hello.  As if all that wasn't enough, feel free to grab a board game and add to the fun. Feeling creative? Draw on the chalkboard walls.   I love this place!
