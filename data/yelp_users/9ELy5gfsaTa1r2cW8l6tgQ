The first time we had My Mother's Restaurant was months ago. My husband and I were feeling homesick, and being from Illinois we got excited when we saw that My Mother's Restaurant had deep dish "Chicago Style." It was such a lie and a huge let down. The pizza was not deep dish,  it was not "Chicago Style," rather it was thick crust. It was so thick that we could not taste the topping, just the crust.  --------------------- Last night we decided to give this place another try since our favorite pizza restaurant was closed. After being on hold for almost 10 minutes right off the get go (which was no big deal since they were busy), my husband finally got to talk to someone. He had to repeat the pizza topping order twice, and the buffalo wings four times. They told us 35-45 mins since they were busy.   When the delivery finally came, we were starving and I was really looking forward to their wings (I had been craving buffalo wings for weeks now).  The pizza was okay, the topping were correct but the dough was a little on the dry side. Now for the wings I had been craving, that came with a side of ranch and celery. They sent us the wrong one. They sent BBQ, and not the buffalo that we wanted, even after my husband repeated himself four times.   I've heard that their other food is great but after last night's dinner being such a failure, we will never be ordering from this restaurant again. We've been disappointed with them twice now.   We like to support local restaurants, we won't be supporting this one.

This place is amazing, and we love that they deliver!!   Their pad thai is one of the best pad thais we've had this side of Phoenix. Everyone is usually so nice and sweet!   I'm so glad to have them close by! This place is defined one of our favorite restaurants!

My husband and I found Tacos Atoyac and were big fans. A big part of it was Dan. He remembered us, and he makes the meal and experience. When he left Tacos Atoyac, it wasn't the same for us. Then we heard about Mucho Macho Taco.   Walking in, Dan remembered us right off the bat. The food was amazing, and just like the name suggests, it's mucho macho! They did not skimp on the meat, using good quality meats packed with amazing spices.   My husband got the carne asada burritos, and bacon taco (yes, BACON!), while I had the roasted turkey mole taco, braised brisket taco, and 50/50 taco. They were amazing, filled with huge chunks of meat! The horchatas were sweet and refreshing.   This place is much closer to our house, and we can ride our bikes to it! Apparently, if we ride our bikes we get a free drink! We will definitely be back to devour more of these amazing mucho macho tacos!
