Terrible service and terrible dry food I wouldn't recommend!  I don't know how they are still open! Literally I am going to Taco Bell where I can spend $5.00 and be much happier and better experience.

Went in at 3pm on a Sunday wasn't busy... Drove all the way from Scottsdale to get some Outback Steakhouse since the one in Scottsdale closed years ago. The hostess seated us and we sat down... Had time to decide what we wanted to order and 15 minutes in we still weren't greeted by a server for drinks or NOTHING. But another couple came in after us & got seated and asked for drinks and we didn't. I am very appalled by the service I received here.

Sara is the best! Years ago I was frightened of the dentist and Sara made me feel so comfortable and I've been going to her since. Dr. Rick is awesome as well! I love the new location it's so modern and clean. :)

Twila's Barbershop is a family operated business in the heart of, South Scottsdale. If your looking to get a great haircut at a reasonable price this is the place to go!  Great environment for everybody at any age. Go give them a try you won't be let down, guaranteed.

When I first went in there was nobody there. That should have been my first sign.  The owner I believe was the one who did my nails. He didn't talk to me at all.  So just as he's finishing up my nails (I got full set gel polish.) they were all bubbly and completely messed up. I didn't have time to have him re do them so I said I'd be back tomorrow.  So the next day I go in and he takes off the gel polish. And has someone else put the polish back on them. They still had a little bubbles and the very next day they all started chipping! Couldn't believe it. I am definitely not going back. Not friendly. Terrible at nails. And just my overall experience wasn't good. I don't recommend them.

Walked in. Wasn't greeted. Took 5+ min to get a menu and a water... Looked over the menu sat there for 10+ minutes not being offered chips salsa or if I was ready to order.... I feel like this establishment is for regulars only the whole bar was full of people (assuming regulars) and they were talking with the bartenders and ignoring me. (I sat myself) I Don't think I will be back. Kind of a bummer because I like Mexican food and live in the area.
