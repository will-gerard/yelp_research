I am hesitant to leave this review only because I am afraid that once the word gets out about how awesome Sakana is, the place will always be packed.   I have had sushi all over the Phoenix valley and this place is hands down my favorite.  The prices are unbeatable, the portion sizes are excellent, and the food is outstanding.  If I were to give any negative comments it is that the service can be just average sometimes, never bad enough to warrant a complaint.  I suggest the Garlic Parmesan Edamame to get you started.  Shrimp Tempura is also one of my favorites.

I visited a couple weekends ago with my wife; very nice view of the lakes, pretty fair price on drinks.  However, the food and service was average at best. The place next door was hosting a wedding and had a larger patio, we will probably try that next.
