Flash back to Paris!!!  I'm a sucker for fresh savory crepes and crispy buttery croissants.  We were in Vegas for 3 days and we ate both breakfast and dessert here every day!  Service is a little slow in the mornings when everyone is trying to get in and out quickly.  So you need to leave 20 mins approx if you are going in the mornings.  I tried 6 different things here and all were DELISH! 1.  Plain Croissant:  Buttery. Flaky. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Paris worthy and huge! 2. Ham and Cheese Croissant:  Rich!  They used 2 kinds of cheese I think and it made it hard to eat the whole things without feeling a little sick.  I suggest splitting this with someone. 3. Spinach and Tomato Quiche: Large individual portion.  Heated to perfection.  Perfect amount of spinach and tomato. 4. Plain Crepe:  Hot off the grill.  Butter added.  Sweet and savory.  I ate this twice! 5. Strawberry Crepe: add strawberries and whipped cream to the plain!  We ordered this twice... be sure to ask for the strawberries on the inside.   I swear it tastes better!! haha 6. Strawberry tarte:  I have NO clue what all is in this delicious piece of heaven but it is amazing.    I really do not think there is anything you can get here and go wrong with pastry wise.  I can't wait to go back and try their sticky buns and a couple other pastries!  If you are in aria, for breakfast, lunch or dinner, you should check this place out!

So... I was a little nervous trying to place based on the Yelp reviews and Yelpers delivered.... we got exactly what we were expecting once we sat down.   Food was just ok.... and expensive for what you get.  Here is what the three of us ordered:  Tai Truffle - $38 I can't remember what white fish the truffle was served on, but this was delicious.  The fish and truffle melted in your mouth.  This was, personally, worth the price.  Spicy Chicken Wings - $18  I didn't try these but my friends said they were just ok.  Definitely not worth $18 for 6 small wings.  Shishito Peppers - $12  Grilled with a side of lemon.  They were just shishito peppers.  Not worth the $12.  Beef Sukiyaki Rice with Poached Egg - $28  expensive... but this was delicious and was the table favorite for the other two girls.  I really like it too, I just liked the truffle more :)  Shrimp Tempura Roll- $18  Nothing special here... shrimp tempura in roll with nothing additional like cucumber or avo!  I would've happily paid $6 for this but not $18!  Mushroom Udon - $18  They used really seasonal mushroom and therefore this dish was good.  Service was just ok.  Friendly but not super prompt for how empty the place was.  Good wine choices.  Bottles priced from $48 to make it more affordable.  After a bottle of wine and food plus tip, the three of us spent $280.    It wasn't terrible but it is extremely overpriced for what you get.    I would only come back for the Tai truffle and the Rice.  Save yourself and your wallet but going somewhere else!

This is probably my favorite restaurant that we tried in the Aria. Ambiance is welcoming, the food delicious, and the service, on point!!  First, the wine list - not too shabby. A decent selection with fair prices.  We ordered a bottle of Whitehall Lane Cabs.  (One of my favorite wineries in Napa.)  Markup on this bottle was not bad for a Vegas restaurant!  There was 5 of us and we shared the food family style.   Potstickers - I didn't try these but everyone at the table really liked them.  Chicken Lettuce wraps - pretty good.... didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for.  I added some of their house hot sauce to spruce it up!  Shiitake Mushrooms - WOW!  These were amazing.  These meaty mushrooms were fried to perfection and then sauteed in a delish sauce!!!  This is was the table favorite for the appetizers.  Chicken Chow Mein - Standard.  I liked that it wasn't too oily!  Spicy Indian-style Fried Rice - I LOVE CURRY so this was amazing!  Perfect heat too!  Ma Po Tofu - I have an emotional tie to this dish...  the tofu had the perfect texture and the sauce was delicious and spicy!  (The portion of this dish was HUGE!  basically this is only thing that didn't get finished at the table.)  Spicy Chicken Hot Pot - I did not try this but was told this was good.  Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushrooms - The table ordered this cooked medium rare.  I didn't try this either, but this was the rest of the table's favorite main dish.  They raved about how perfectly the meat was cooked and how amazing the sauce was.   There were so many other items on the menu we wanted to try so I cannot wait to come back here and try some more new dishes as well as reorder some of our favorites!

I love this place!!!  I've been 4-5 times here and have had great experiences every time.   First thing is first: GIN AND TONICs.  Do yourself a favor, even if you hate gin or tonic.  This is a must try!  This last time, 4 of us girls went, so we each order a different one.  I've learned my favorite is the Tierra or the Citrico.  But seriously, you cannot go wrong with any of them!  Now, to the food.  This is everything I can remember ordering: Pan de cristal con tomate fresco: Bread with Tomato... sounds boring, but it's really fresh, crispy, salty, delicious.  Great to have and pair with other dishes. Manchego flor de esqueva: I didn't try this but everyone at the table loved it.  Gambas al ajillo:  If you like garlic and shrimp, this is your dish!  It comes with a crispy and soft baguette that is great for dipping into the garlicy/oily/spicy sauce! Croquetas de pollo:  Little fried chicken and cheese fritters.  Delicious Datiles con tocino: Bacon wrapped dates.  I had to cave and try this.  Crispy, sweet, amazing!! Trigueros con romesco: Cauliflower with dates and olives.  Unique taste but really good if you are a veghead! Potato Bravas:  I literally have no clue what sauce they had on them, or under them but these are a MUST! Brussel Sprout salad: I cannot find on their online menu, but this guy, WOW, you have to order even if you don't like brussels! Setas en escabeche: Delicious wild mushrooms with a polenta-y side.  Really good!! Flan: Ehhhh... I've had better Torrijas:  Now we are talking.  Spanish toast thats caramelized with fruit and vanilla rum ice cream.  Unique, only waited like 10 minutes.  Go with this guy for dessert!!!  Wish this place didn't have 3.5 stars.  Deserves more.  Only thing is it's a little pricey but I think it's worth it!

I came here based on the yelp reviews.  I was hoping to cool down with an acai bowl.    I ended up getting their pitaya bowl and a wheatgrass shot.  I was a little disappointed that you cannot choose your toppings or that they didn't have flavor options.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked their bowl though.  I think I was most pleased with their homemade granola that topped the bowl.  It was sweet, crunchy, and full of sweet dried fruit and perfectly roasted nuts.   I enjoyed the "down to earth" feel of the place.  It almost has a boutique feel with the product they sell.   The staff was also really friendly and prompt.  I will definitely return here when I am in the area!
