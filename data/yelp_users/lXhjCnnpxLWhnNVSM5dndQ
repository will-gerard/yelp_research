We have been searching for a great Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area for 14 years, After reading so many great reviews I thought this would be it. Sadly, it isn't.. We had such high expectations but I give this a C+ at best. We ordered takeout. When we got home, the Salt & Pepper Chicken we ordered turned out to be very chewy Salt & Pepper Calamari. Our Orange Chicken had very little heat and although it was listed as lightly battered and fried ours had no batter on it at all and appeared to have been sauted instead. The fried rice was decent as was the Pork Egg Fu Yung but nothing to get excited about. So the search continues.

We had friends in from out of state this week and I knew they'd love the sunset view from this restaurant, They did. But, as it turned out, the sunset paled to the food that Chef Gregory Wiener served us that night. We were in for treat after treat right from the beginning with appetizers of Savory Chicken Waffles and Salmon Rillette. We shared everything because it was so good we al wanted to share. I have to say, he turned me into a salmon lover. This from someone that doesn't like fish! The roasted Bone Marrow was so delicious I had resist the temptation to just pick up the bone & save it for myself. When the Green Chilli Goat Pot Roast came out I was reluctant to try it. I shouldn't have been! It was fantastic! Our guest polished off every smidge of his Pork Temple, while the rest of us took leftovers home of Simple Roasted Chicken and Double Cut Pork Chop. The servings were generous and all the meat was incredibly juicy and full of flavor. Not only that, the presentations were beautiful. Desserts were equally as enticing. Service was impeccable. The wine list is excellent with choices to fit every budget. A visit from the Chef mid dinner made the night just that more special. I cannot understand why every table in the place wasn't full...it should be every night! This restaurant is deserving of your patronage. You won't regret it!

Does anyone know where I can buy a case of the Branding Iron BBQ Sauce they used to sell at El Paso BBQ? It was a family favorite & I miss it!

What a great little neighborhood place! The minute you walk in you feel like a friend. The food is fresh and innovative without being pretentious. They have a wonderful selection of wines including several local choices which I appreciate. The locally source a lot of their food as well. I am anxious to try their brunch soon too as it sounds amazing!

I love this place! Reasonable pricing for professional service. My knives are in investment and Corey keeps them sharp which makes my work so much more fun!

While I am not normally a big fan of beer, I must say that this event was so much fun I can't wait until next year! With the wide variety of beers available to taste, I was able to find a few that even a non beer drinker like me could love. The crowds were large but not so large as to have to wait more than a couple of minutes to try any of the beers. The layout allowed for you to move from vendor to vendor easily, skipping those that didn't interest you. I was impressed by the level of professionalism by the production staff. I don't normally think of a beer fest as being an upscale event but this clearly was just that. The crowd was not your typical college beer drinkers but rather an eclectic mix of knowledgeable aficionados eager to have a great time. And despite all the flowing beer, there were no signs of poor alcohol induced behavior.  Adding to the vibe was a wonderful island-style reggae band, KavaKreation! All I can say is WOW! They performed for about 3 hours, with each of their sets building to a crowd rousing final set that brought out the dancer in everyone present.  Clearly, a crowd favorite that added value to the already reasonably priced event.   Mark your calendar for next year...this is a not to be missed event!

2013 & Another great year as this festival continues to grow. We especially liked the addition of the "Cooling Zones" that had misting fans and free water in there.   Amazing selection of different brews that we've never heard of.   It was a little hot but the crowd was great.  We'll continue to return every year if we can! Loved the new venue too! So much room & shade! And the fact that he vast majority of the tickets buyers really know & understand craft beer as opposed to to some events where it's just "kids" looking for a fast buzz is a huge plus for me...great knowledgeable crowd with no safety issues. I met so many people that travel from other states for this event & I understand why. Great job, Motley Brews!

This was by far the most well put together beer festival I have ever been to!  We had VIP tickets as well - the food was an incredible spread that lasted for almost the entire time by Todd English P.U.B.  Although the line for food was busy in the first hour, Todd English quickly fixed the situation and things flowed smoothly. The situation could be been avoided completely if some customers hadn't felt the need to pile their plates so high with food as if it were their last meal.  But who could blame them...it was fantastic! Oysters, lobster, prime rib - it was amazing! And TONS of giveaways in the VIP tent too... t shirts, hats, magnetic dart boards, and clean bathrooms! Outside of VIP, the venue lays out very well and is definitely a hidden gem in the Downtown area.  Over 175 beers total I counted and most of them were great!  It was busy but never felt too crowded. The organizer definitely made sure you got your money's worth and then some! Kudos to the maintenance crews too who worked feverishly making sure to keep the garbage cans emptied and the entire venue clean...they even swept trash off the lawn areas! It's that attention to detail that makes for a great event. This was just a well run and fun event. Oh...and great music on top of it all! I especially enjoyed KavaKreation...more of them next time, please!  Don't miss this next year! This is an event that will most certainly grow; the organizers of Motley Brews definitely know what they are doing! We'll definitely be returning in April to the Great Vegas Festival of Beer as well!

Friday my husband and I wandered into this little gem tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale. This is another winning effort by Aaron May and his team! Just a small tavern but the food far surpasses any bar food in other restaurants. The choices are both original while playing off familar tastes we all love. I had the Bufflao Chicken Dumplings and oh my! I may never eat chicken wings again! The dumplings were moist and filled with all the things you'd expect in a wing...spicy, but not so much to overpower the chicken, mixed with celery. But the killer aspect of this dish was the Blue Cheese sauce! Best I have ever had! It was thick and oh so creamy! Honestly, I would spread it on shoe leather and it would be fantastic!  We shared an order of the best fried pickles I have ever had anywhere. The panko bread crumbs gave just the right amount of crunch to a pickle chip that waws not too salty and had a nice crispness to it. Just yummy! My husband had a burger...with bacon and cheese. I din't get to taste it because he scarfed every last nibble down himselff. But I can tell you it looked incredible!  The staff here is also a winner! Helpful, attentive and friendly. This is the place that even if its your first visit, you'll feel at home...the place where "everyone knows your name". There are tvs tuned to sports in easy view as well.    All in all this is a place I highly recommend...a wonderful addition to Old Town by Aaron May & Quinn Goldsberry!
