This location is awful. Not only do they continue to nag you about what your car needs to get more money from you, but they also give you incorrect estimates both with time and money. Today I decided to wake up early on a Saturday in order to avoid having to wait longer then normal. The store opens up at 7:30, I arrived at 7:45ish with very few cars in front of me, maybe one or two. After explaining what I wanted he gave me an estimate of less then one hour. After being there for two hours I attempted numerous times to determine how much longer I had to wait. Needless to say, no one even came up to me to let me know. After the three hour mark, my car was "ready." I arrive to my car and the cleaning was sub-par. The windows were streaky with remnants of cleaning product still visible and there was dirt in obvious places. The part that really pissed me off was that my dash display was completely dirty, it was hard to read the speedometer. I feel I have given this place enough chances to prove me wrong (been to this place 5+ times) and I am never completely satisfied. Long story short. I wouldn't recommend coming here even if it's free.
