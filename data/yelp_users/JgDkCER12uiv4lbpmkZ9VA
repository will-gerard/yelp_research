I was at your grand opening, I was there after, and I'm not there anymore.   Wild Thaiger was never a great option for Thai in the valley. There aren't really any terrible aspects about the restaurant, it's just that nothing really makes you say "wow! this is good."  My last visit was with a friend who doesn't get out much, his wife likes good ol' steak and potatoes, so I thought I'd take him somewhere he couldn't go otherwise. Bad choice. We ordered the peanut chicken and it tasted more like peanut butter chicken. It was overpowering, and also one of the first times I have ever sent a dish back and asked for something else. Of course the service is good, they never have anything better to do.

This place is a JOKE! I have been shopping here for years since both my current and previous residences make it the closest market to me.   They always used to be open until midnight, but nooooo they decided to start closing at 10PM... WTF! I used to always go after work at 10:30 and they would talk about it being the 1030 rush where it would get really busy. What shit for brains thinks it is a good quality idea to close up before your daily rush?  Also the place ALWAYS has long lines. It is not that it's really understaffed, it just seems like most of the employees are fucking off somewhwere. I know most of them by name I shop here so much, and they are not a good group of managers.   Additionally, they close the deli counter at like 7PM.... seriously, wtf is wrong with this place?  Oh and did I mention some illegal (I have proof he was illegal) backed into my car there and the security guard (not a safeway employee but still should maintain professionalism) told me that it looked like it was my fault.   Screw you safeway!  See you tomorrow.  Edit, forgot to add how they are always out of their HOUSE BRAND water. Seems like half the time I go there they don't have it. And yes, I agree with other reviews there are always some hotties in there.

The Teeter House is a trip, like no other. I was drinking with a couple of newly met friends next door at Rose and Crown and they wanted to go here to check it out, so I was a good sport about it. We tried sitting at the "bar" but the owner said we cant sit there, because thats the managers seat..... eh? I was definitely surprised to notice they have a full bar, but all the other aspects were very very odd. The plants in the bath tub, the victorian old lady wallpaper, and the same dining room table seats my parents had growing up in the 80's. Maybe it's my generation, but this place did NOT appeal to me whatsoever, and who tells their customers they aren't allowed to sit at the bar?

This restaurant is a perfect example of why I give my money to local business owners.  This is a sparsely decorated gem in Midtown Phoenix. In an area full of lunch only, counter order spaces, one would think this wouldn't be welcome. I love a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high quality and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable. I've had the Oyako and Teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious. You definitely wait a few minutes for your food, and that is a good thing because it means they are not mass producing food and waiting for people to order it, like Tokyo Express does.   Good food alone though, won't garner a five-star review for a rice bowl. What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people I've ever encountered. She welcomes every customer, and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner. She does not come across as fake or ass-kissish. I just get a calm, warm, and welcome feeling from this woman when I come in here.  It's not even just her either. Her staff always looks happy, and has run of the soda fountain, water, lemonade, etc. Everyone just seems to be happy. It's true that if you take care of your staff, they make your customers happy as well.  Many other places make me feel so unwelcome around here at lunch time, but I can always count on Blue Fin to treat me like family and give me a solid rice bowl.

Let me tell you why I used to love Coach and Willie's...  They used to have awesome wings that were like $6 and great drink specials every night of the week. They used to show all the local sports with the sound cranked up.   Last night is the last time I will go to Coach and Willies, let me tell you why:  1. I sat at the bar for 6 minutes before one of the bartenders came to help me. They weren't even working the slow bar.   2. The wings are now $9 and had no sauce and tasted identical to the ones at Majerle's that always give me the schlitz.  3. Someone crapped on the floor in the mens room while I was there and put his pants in the toilet. The proceeded to dump an entire bottle of bleach in the mens room that made everyone in the restaurants eyes water and offered no apologies.  4. I don't want to listen to your shitty R&B top 40 hits while the Suns are on. Wait, let me rephrase that. I don't want to listen to that crap ever.  5. The service is overall bad. I didn't get the extra buffalo sauce I asked for. I watched the kid forget and get sidetracked on a convo with coworkers no more than 15 seconds after I asked. My cup was empty most of the meal.  I hope you guys are doing well with your cholo hip hop nights you do there upstairs because you sure as hell aren't focused on customer service anymore. Or good food for that matter.

I love Fate, and have been there dozens of times. I agree with a lot of reviewers about the attitudes from the girls who work there. They act as though you are a bother. I can't understand why someone would work a job they hate. The food though, is incredibly tasty, and has plenty of options for vegitarians and carnivores. I like the hipster atmosphere and the food a ton. The drinks are weak, and overpriced, but the food reasonable. This translates over to next door where they charge 9 bucks for a well drink. They also treat you like scum. I'm only giving this restaurant a 4 because I pay a lot more attention to food quality and taste than I do service. I also love the fact they are open late. I work til 10pm most nights so its good to have an option that isn't fast food.

Been here twice, and I cant say either time was a thrilling experience. One thing I can say as a plus is the bartenders at lunch are always friendly and quick. The food so, not so great. I can never eat it all, the portions are extremely generous, but it's never very high quality. Just kinda seems like it is coming from a slop kitchen, and not really fit for a human. The house margaritas are actually pretty good, and a fair value. I recommend hanging out with a margarita and some chips and salsa (also pretty good) and then moving elsewhere for dinner. Call me crazy, but restaurants that leave me feeling sluggish and greasy are never my favorites.

As far as Hooter's restaurants go (blech) this one is probably the best. I give it four stars as a reference to it's sister locations, not in reference to how good it is overall. The food is terrible quality, and the drinks extremely "well measured" meaning they are not strong. Hence why I can drink 12 margaritas in a 6 hour period and still be coherent. They sure charge for them like they are doubles though. There are a few girls working here who are very attractive and friendly (not to sound like a dirty old man, just that usually Hooter's has the worst service) and that definitely helps.

This has been my car wash since I lived in midtown off 3rd street and Thomas. They do a great job, and are very accommodating if they miss a spot. They tend to be somewhat expensive, but then again they are not scratching your car with machines. I used to get the side wash with my Audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails, and for $15 you couldn't get a better wash in town.   I don't recommend their detail service, as they are not very complete, but for car washes A+

Downtown Deli is a staple for a lot of local workers. Not for me though, I hadn't been even though I've worked across the street from there, and I live just mere blocks away. Finally took the trip and was very pleased.  My initial reaction was mixed. It feels like a dining hall inside or even like a dark corridor with six-tops scattered throughout. In the back of the restaurant is the sandwich line, with some of the nicest sandwich makers I've ever seen. Oddly, this is somewhat the norm downtown. You go in these old places and there are people who have worked there forever and just are in their workplace having a great time. That attitude when you are dining can be infectious, and contributes greatly to your experience.  My sandwich, the Straw, was a generous portion of Pastrami, sour kraut, and swiss cheese. Some may say it's a boring standby, but I say a Straw is a great way to judge a deli. This place made it right. Their prices are not cheap (lunch for two with only one drink, $20) but I don't mind paying a little more for the extra friendly service and generous portions.   It's not a place that I can't wait to go back to, but I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with their meal here.

Not sure why Ichi Ban is getting a bad bunch of reviews. I went here many many times when I lived in the neighborhood, and while it doesn't stack up to Hana, Yasu, or the like, it's a nice solid neighborhood place.  The owner, Seth, is a genuinely nice person, and prides himself in being creative with the sushi roll list and taking care of his customers. They offer about 20 rolls that are all something different than the norm. They make use  of a lot of spicy things, and fish combinations that aren't usually seen. I give them props for being different.   The service here is great as well. Though I always get a very odd vibe from the servers and the restaurant. I've been here a few times when I am the only one and the 4-5 employees on the clock are all staring at you, waiting for you to need something. Interesting, but leave me alone for a few minutes. You creep me out when you watch me eat.   They don't have any music, and the place lacks a lot of atmosphere, but the food is pretty tasty. At lunch time it is an order at the counter, rice bowl kind of place. Dinner time, you have a full menu to order from and everything is good. They do not have a full liquor license, only beer and sake.

When Sen. Ken Cheuvront opened this restaurant, I was living in Midtown phoenix and it was at a time when a lot of restaurants in the area didn't exist. I was beyond excited of it's creation.   It's a very trendy urban feel, with a nice patio on Central Avenue. Located at the bottom of Artisan condos, it's not a terribly easy place to see if you're driving by. They feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses, of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant. They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night.  A particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops.   There is nothing here that is oddly unique, but everything is interesting, and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out. Especially during a first friday.

100% completely underwhelming. I didn't want to rate it 2 (Meh. I've experienced better) but I even more so didn't want to rate it 3 (A-OK.) I don't consider this place to be A-OK, more like completely average.  The atmosphere is much larger than I thought it would be and is all counter order. They get packed for lunch and have lots of Chicago shit on the walls. It's a good enough place.  My Gyro Feta came with stale pita bread, too many giant slices of red onions that overwhelmed everything, and pretty much just seemed like something I'd find in my cafeteria at work. The quality was crap and it was $6.45. I could go to Cyprus Pita Grill and get a really good gyros for the same money.

After a few visits, they will start coming to the drive through counter with your drink in hand. Quick learners if you are a regular. The prices are very low for a drive through liquor store, which always tend to be a tad high. This is the closest one also, for people who live downtown, and can count on it being open until last call almost every night but Sunday. The owners are nice people who will actually treat you in a friendly manner. A+

After an online argument with Julia T. about what constitutes Mexican food, I decided to try Rosita's Place, since she gave it such high praise.   Upon walking in, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how clean the restaurant was. I was expecting more of a Carolina's type atmosphere. The lady who brought us our menus and sat us was very friendly. I thought the fish pond, while extremely odd, was a relaxing touch in the center of the dining room.   We ordered a half-pitcher of margarita, some chips (since they were raved about) and it all came pretty much right away. The salsa was good, not great, but good. The red being the more flavorful, though hot, and the green being comparatively mild and bland. Margaritas were tasty, but verrrrrry weak. We went through the pitcher and wondered if they had much booze at all. I like the taste of tequila a lot, especially over margarita mix, but I could not taste any tequila in these. Then came the entrees, Chicken Enchiladas for her and Red Burro Enchilada style for me. I ate my food, as I will never leave something on my plate, but I was telling my girlfriend the whole time that it smelled like canned dog food. I didn't say this because I thought it was bad, or gross, but actually smelled identical to dog food. She agreed. I thought long and hard and today it came to me, it smelled like Pedigree brand.   Overall it is a clean restaurant with great service, but unfortunately somewhat questionable food. I want to know what drugs people are on that makes them think this place has any type of quality. I'll probably go back and try something else, because it had a few things going for it, but the food is NOT one of them.  +1 for cleanliness +1 for service -3 for food

I love Whataburger. The burgers are far and away the best fast food burgers you can get. Don't even say that In-N-Out is better. I always get my burger the same way, #1 Whataburger with sliced jalapeno, grilled onions, bacon, and cheese... yes its indigestion central. The last 3 times I have been there I got home only to realize my burger was not how I ordered it. The first time, they gave me a whole grilled jalapeno. What the hell am I going to do with this other than get a firebomb in my stomach? and the onions weren't grilled. Who goes to Whataburger and orders a side of a giant jalapeno!?   Second visit, there were no jalapenos to speak of whatsoever, not even the giant grilled one. They got the onions, cheese, and bacon right though.  Third visit, I straight up got someone elses order. I got a friggin chicken sandwich. I'll make the trek to another store from now on. This one is just craptastic.

Not impressed whatsoever. Everything here tasted a little off, and it was very expensive. I've been here twice and my favorite thing in Chinese restaurants is hot and sour soup. Gourmet House of Hong Kong's hot and sour soup is an abortion. The ingredients in the soup are weird looking, the shrimp are little brine shrimp looking things about the size of a pencil eraser, and the taste of the soup is really gross. It's sweet and kind of tastes like bad faucet water.  As for the main dishes, they lack taste. My Kung Pao Chicken was completely bland, and this is supposed to be a spicy dish! For Chinese food this place is pretty gross, and I'm surprised at how many people love it. I guess there is no accounting for taste, which most folks apparently don't have.

This is THE WORST strip club I have ever been to. I have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well. I've been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can't even dance, clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies, even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club.   The New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.  The dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star. It would be negative one if it were an option. Hi LIter, Bombshells, and even Cheetah's are a ton better than this place. They are cheaper, have better talent, and are very friendly places. Even the overpriced Bourbon Street would be a better bet than this.

Being a guy who always perfers to have service done at the dealer for convienence, loaner cars, and recourse if there are any problems, it's just too damned expensive to do a BMW Inspection II with fluid flushes. Chapman wanted over $1,200.... Bavarian did it for under $500 and let me choose which fluids would be used on the car.   They are friendly people with conversational skills who seem genuinely interested in making sure that you are happy with what you got. There is no pressure to get extra services that you may or may not need, and nobody is trying to sell you things that could do more harm than good, unlike *ahem* Atwood European.   I picked up my car at the end of the day as promised, and they'd put my sunscreen in my windshiled while it was parked, and the mechanic came out to help me back out of a tight parking lot. Anyone can perform an oil change and fluid flushes, but it's the little details like being honest, helpful, and pleasant that make the difference.

I drove by this place almost daily for years and never had the desire to go in. It looks downright scary from the outside and is wedged between a laundromat and a mexico bus station. The dirt parking lot doesn't help the image either, nor does the fact that it looks like an abandoned titty club where you might find a dead stripper behind.   Nevermind all that.  This place has very good food. This place has very good prices. Damnit, this place has the hottest green salsa ever made. They don't speak much English, but I can order food in Spanish so that works out. The green chiles actually appear to be fresh instead of that canned crap. Nothing on the menu was groundbreaking, but everything tasted fresh, clean, and well prepared.   If you go there, look at the sign on the window about the restroom being for customers only. I wrote it, swear. It had the word "costumers" and I asked them if I could escribe them a nuevo signo. They let me. I've got a little fame here.

Well, I finally know where Rito's is. It's in the hood, surrounded by scary shit I don't like.   Went to Rito's for lunch (don't think they are open for dinner nor would I go if they were) on the day after super bowl and every creepy tattooed head cholo in the neighborhood was there. I was freaked the hell out through my entire meal wondering if I should really be there. I grew up around these people, in Maryvale, and regularly go to Sunnyslope and have no issues. Maybe it was the fact there were no other white people nearby, and I was in the middle of a residental neighborhood, which made me feel as though I had walked into some gang's territory.   I was still able to eat my meal though. I ordered the red chimi enchilada style. OH SNAP! That was the best chimi I think I have ever had. The food here is not eally cheap perse, but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything. I wholeheartedly felt that I would go back on a regular basis if not for two things 1) it weren't in the location it's in and 2) it weren't so high fat.  At least go try it once, and take CASH.

This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. The food is always the best tasting of places I've been to, and probably the least "watered down" in terms of spice. The place is modeled to look like a little taj mahal which is kinda goofy, but it's very nice inside and out. They have a delicious buffet for lunch with a menu that changes almost daily, unlike a lot of indian buffets where they have the same items for a week on the buffet line. The service is always good, even the first time I went I ordered chicken curry (I'd never had indian food) because it was a safe bet. The man asked me if I wanted an order of naan or rice and I didn't really want to order anything else. He said "well how are you going to eat the curry? with a spoon?" and brought me a basket of bread on the house. He knew I was trying something for the first time and wanted me to enjoy my experience. I've been back quite a few times and tried just about every other Indian place in town, and this one is still by far the best.

Alright, I'll admit I've been driving past Red Devil for a decade now and always wondering what it was all about. It was always busy, seemingly always open, and really odd looking enough that it drew my interest.   After all these years, I finally decided to try Red Devil only because it was time I actually stopped, and I had a craving for spinach and artichoke dip. Upon walking in, it was obvious this place has been here forever. It's a relic, and it probably hasn't been remodeled since, well... ever. They still have the light up signs for hte order numbers, and the entire restaurant feels like a cave. It's reminiscent of all those old school Mexican restaurants you find scattered around town with no windows, etc. We were friendily greeted twice upon entry and seated almost instantaneously. The crowd was mixed, but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd. There were some people from Honeywell, and some contractors, as well as some teachers.   The appetizer spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty... if not a bit overly greasy but with the right amount of fat, salt, and other artery clogging goodness. I ordered the lunch special small cheese pizza, and at the table was also a small white pizza. The red sauce pizza was average, with a very sweet sauce, a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a "it's low quality but oh so tasty" kind of taste to it. The white pizza had no olive oil, no garlic, no anything outside of breat and cheese. It was cheesy bread, make no mistake.   Overall, I thought the food was average if not slightly below average, but there is something about Red Devil that made me feel comfortable here and welcome. The staff was friendly, there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer, two pies, and two iced teas. I felt it to be very reasonable.

I want to set the scene on this one...  A friend from work and I were bar hopping all over downtown and riding bicycles. We had already been to Carly's, Lucky Strike, Roosevelt, Bikini, Paisley Violin, and Lost Leaf. It was a perfectly fine drunken evening. Riding by District, I said hi to three women smoking on the patio. They said hi back, and I thought that was it. 1/2 block later, I look back and my friend is not anywhere to be seen. He made convo with the three, and scored one of their numbers. SWEET! Well, an hour of talking to them and he had an open invitation for us to join them for Chris Isakk... I wasn't feeling it though. It's just Chris Isakk, and I can't drive, and the train doesn't go there, and a taxi costs too much.... the only option is to bike! it's almost four miles!! So we biked, and biked, and biked.   Finally, after the most awkwardly drunken bike ride down roosevelt for several miles, we arrived to a full parking lot and no idea where to go or how to get in. This place has no signage about which entrance is what. I go to lock my bike to a fence and the girl at the door says I cannot do that here. When I asked where I could lock it up, she replied "sir, I make $5.75 an hour." Ok, cool, but where can I lock my bike up? She said I could lock it to a light pole, so I started to do that, then she said "not that light pole sir. I make $5.75 an hour please don't make my job hard." I don't care how much you make. This wen't on for 10 minutes. Then trying to get into the place was next to impossible. We couldn't get close enough to the door to exchange tickets with our contact, and she couldn't go out the door because they have a no-reentry policy. Eventually some young girl with authority told us it was our lucky day and we could both go in for free... YESSSSSS! My sweet brunette savior.   Inside the venue, everything goes in a circle, and is very intimate. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. The stage rotates so everyone gets a good view for half the show. They have plenty of concession stands, and $7 a beer is at least better than Chase Field, US Airways Center, or Dodge. The ride back home consisted of singing Chris Isakk songs and screaming and yelling all the way down Washington back downtown. Minus the retard at the front door, this is a great place to see a show.

This place has really tasty food. The two times I have been there the dishes were all very enjoyable and the prices are more than fair. The women who work here as servers are almost too attentive and helpful and I've always been very happy with their service.   Their hot and sour soup is delicoius and I've found myself craving it on many ocassions.

What a delightfully friendly couple that own this place. I'm not going to talk about Blimpie's food quality, you all know what they have and what it tastes like. The owners, however, are very nice people that like to converse with their regulars and treat everyone like they are a friend.   If you're looking for fast food in this area, you should try this Blimpie over Taco Bell, KFC, etc.

In response to the people asking why anyone would rate this place less than 5 stars... we don't all have the same taste, thats why.  I like Pane Bianco quite a bit, but I have to admit that I have only had one sandwich of the menu, and that is the Soppresata. The first few times I had it, it was covered in roasted red peppers, and oh so delicious. One day they started using carmelized onions, killed the sandwich, and that is why I stopped going. I like the concept, and I like the deal they have worked out with Lux next door which allows you to eat there as long as you buy something from them. They don't have to do that, so it's nice they do. I have always liked Chris, and praised his use of high quality ingredients, and his sandwich shop is no exception. Only thing I don't like is sitting on the side of Central Avenue listening to cars whistle by. I always wish they would move the patio dining to the other parking lot on the south side of the restaurant, and then use the current patio for more parking. At least this way you wouldn't have to listen to the cars as much. Don't think they own that lot though.

I've never not had a good time at George and Dragon. This place always has something fun going on whether it be karaoke, dart/pool tournaments, trivia, etc. The crowd is always a rambunctious and disorderly one, but that just makes it more fun. Eye candy is always abound here as well. I've never seen so many freshly 21 year.... wait this is a family friendly site.  Drinks here are not any more expensive than other brit/irish pubs, but I always do like to order two at a time because it gets to be busy and waiting for a bartender or cocktail waitress can take a few minutes. They have three dart boards, one real and two electronic, as well as two pool tables and a couple arcade games. There is also an electronic jukebox that seems to have every song known to man.  After 10+ visits I've never had any food here, so I cannot comment on that, but who eats at a place like this anyway? It's a funbar!

I agree with the previous review by Samantha regarding the service. There are guys who will flat out ignore you and some that will really go out of their way. I purchased my fairly high dollar Kona from them a couple years ago and have been happy with the way they treated me since. Jorge comes across extremely gruff, but when you get him to open up he is the most helpful guy in the store. They do wednesday night rides around squaw peak if you know them I highly recommend it. They also helped me do my tubeless conversion and let me use space in the shop along with tools. Class act guys! Thanks Eric for all your help

Good ol' gay hanratty's.  One beer on tap, no credit cards or tabs, no food. It's kind of punk rock, but in a country sort of way.   It's cheap, they have games, and it's pretty much a shit hole. It is NOT a good place to watch sports, despite what they say. You can only hear the music, not the TVs.   If you are hungry, they serve sandwiches at lunch time that are literally wonder bread, kraft singles, and bologna. I fucking love it. And at dinner, you can order from a plethora of restaurants that deliver here. And Hanratty's will even provide the silverware!

This is my favorite starbucks. The employees here are friendly and they are pretty quick considering it is *never* not busy. I went today and sat on the patio and had a yogurt parfait and a cup of coffee. It was very enjoyable.

Didn't know this was a gay bar when my girlfriend and I walked in. That won't sway my review, especially since we had just left Roscoe's prior to coming here.   What will sway my review is the level of awkwardness. The transvestite sitting at the bar with his/her legs wide open showing the world the junk under the skirt. The 5 toothed cuban guy eating beef jerky, playing pool, and copping as many tranny feels as he could. The scary trip to the bathroom that could have resulted in a scary time for me because two guys were standing waiting for the urinal right behind me... not like off to the corner of the bathroom, or even outside the bathroom, but RIGHT BEHIND ME.   Yeah, the awkwardness made this place weird. I always thought it was just a neighborhood alcoholic bar, but that it definitely is not. It seemed like a place for trannies, tranny chasers, weirdos, and locals (like myself and my girlfriend) who don't know any better.

What is the big deal about this place?!  It's not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just don't understand the hype. Maybe I've had Giordano's, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's too much in Chicago but this place just wasn't it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick.  Service was weird, and I'm pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare. We got someone elses order of wings, and didn't know they weren't ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad.   I'd go back here again but I wouldn't really be too eager to.

I'm repeatedly astounded at how many people in this city who claim to be in the "culinary know" have no idea what Schreiner's is. Besides the tremendous brown bag lunch special, which consists of any dog or sausage with chips and a soda for $5, Schreiner's is a great place to buy loaf meat, weiners, and sausages. Many chefs in town swear by their products and it's for good reason, they are some of the best around.   I made some home made Sonoran Hot Dogs last night using Schreiner's hot dogs, and it was one of the best dogs I'd ever had.

This used to be THE place to go for great service while buying a car. I've purchased a few vehicles here and it was always a pleasure. Mark Exposito and Cory Epperson always went out of their way to make sure problems were solved in a timely manner. Well, I understand the Eppersons parted ways and Mark Exposito can only do so much on his own. Most of the sales people are young kids, and I routinely have talked circles around them about the cars they are trying to sell. My last two purchases I really honestly wanted them to be here, honestly, but the lack of knowledge, follow up, or expertise have me vowing to never return. They blew up what was one of the most honest friendly and helpful car dealers I'd ever been to.

Holy mother of sandwiches. I travel to Chicago a lot, and was spoiled years ago by a place called Perry's Deli on Roosevelt and Clark. I only get to go 2 or 3 times a year but I have their hot Pastrami every time I go at least once. I have tried Pastrami sandwiches all over Phoenix and have never been able to find anything that touches Perry's. I went to Katz', another place on Central and Camelback, as well as a few others on the westside. Finally on a recommendation by a colleage of mine I went to Scott's and it was almost... almost what Perry's was. The meat was high quality and extremely generous, probably the biggest sandwich I've seen in these parts. Everything about the sandwiches there was perfect. My only gripe, and this is just personal preference is that delis/sandwich shops should not be waiter service. I want to order at the counter, go through a cafeteria line, and pay at the end, you know, east coast style. They also close at 8pm, so dinner is cut off early. I wholeheartedly recommend this place for lunch, its unreal how good it is.

I'm not some ass face who thinks gay people are vermin and their bars are cesspools of shittyness. I'm open minded, and I have been in here a few times.   Roscoe's has everything a good sports bar should have, darts, pool, lots of screens, and a well stocked bar. Sure, they play crap on the radio, but it's what their customers want, and I'm understanding that if I walk into someone elses domain, I have to be prepared to listen to their music.   Bartender there is legit. I saw him once at the bar and when he ID'd me, he said "thanks Fred." Two weeks later, I went back and sat at the bar at the same spot, he said I look familiar and guessed my name was Fred. I was pretty damn impressed. They pour rather freely, they have great 2 for 1 specials during the week, and the Buffalo Chicken Pizza is one of my favorite things to eat in town.   Overall, Roscoe's isn't a place I would really go to just to hang out... kind of a sausage fest, even more so than most sports bars. They also have music playing over the sports, which is fine for most games but when it's a big game, the TV should take precedence. That all said, Roscoe's is the only gay bar I've ever felt comfortable in. I've been in Amsterdam and Kobalt as well as a few others, and they always make me uneasy after a while. I'm not afraid of being hit on, nor do I care (I'm too scruffy and dirty for a gay bar anyway) if I am, but there are almost always conversations that I'm just not ready to hear.   So yeah, Roscoe's is a 3 star bar overall, but I wanted to give it a fourth star for being a gay bar that a straight can feel comfortable sitting in for a while.

I have to agree with every other reviewer. This place is awful. I was recommended to go here by Chapman BMW and I like to think I'm pretty good at sizing people up when I meet them. This was no exception.  Andrew, the owner of the shop, treated me like I was an absolute moron and tried his damndest to upsell me with things I know I don't need or want. I've been a car enthusiast for a long time, and I can do most of this work myself except I don't have the tools or space. I know that a BMW auto tranny should not be flushed with pressure if it is high mileage, and I told him I don't want the service. He continued to argue with me and tell me he knows better. I'm sure he does quite well selling un-necessary service to your average luxury car owner, but I know better.   Arrogance only gets you so far in life. I walked out of here with a serious bad taste in my mouth.

Ok, first time I was here was for lunch. I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had. Noticed the pool, darts, pinball, golden tee, and ancient bowling game and thought I would take my friends back there and share this incredible place.   two days later, for dinner and drinks, 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a Friday night. She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time. So there we have it, a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulations.  I'll be getting my hepititis c test next week. (joking.... kinda)

Recently discovered by the Canadians, Moto roughly translated means "don't eat sushi here, but everything else on the menu is great!"  My first visit to Moto was several years ago when I had some sushi and sashimi items. My most vivid memory was ordering a Philadelphia roll and watching the sushi guy take an already made roll off the counter and cut it into pieces and serve it to me. I'm sorry, has that been there long?   Flash forward to a month ago when my parents were at Matsuri and wanted a "Japanese" meal. I recommended Moto because it was the only place I thought would be open at 2PM on a Saturday. I was drawn to revisit it because they offer some interesting beer selections on draught. Well, they do, and it exposed me to a couple of interesting beers I'd not heard of. My folks wanted to order sushi, so I let them, and sure enough the rolls they ordered, as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good. Everyone at the table ordered entrees and we were all very happy. The build your own noodle bowls are great. I have been back a couple times since and really enjoy it every time.   The service here has been great every visit with a staff of girls all in their twenties that are hip, but not in an asinine way that some of these other types of places can be. Try getting a twenty something girl to show you any respect at Stingray, RA, etc. Ain't gonna happen, friend. I'm also impressed that they offer a great happy hour, especially Sunday when it is all day long.   Yep, Moto is a great place, as long as you don't order the sushi. The menu items are too good to pass up to order something that is sub-par or average.

Shopping at a big box electronic store can often be frustrating. You get a bunch of kids helping you who for the most part have no idea what they are talking about or doing, a general amount of confusion trying to find what you need, and little service if you have an issue. In my experience, Best Buy, Fry's, Circuit City, Ultimate, etc. have all been the same. This store has proven to be an exception.  I went in to buy a Mac Mini a few weeks ago, and I had an issue with the open box computer they sent me... wouldn't turn on. When I went to return it, they didn't have any other open box deals, so I was forced to buy a new one. The manager, a little asian guy, marked a new one down to the open box price for me. This was totally unexpected, and definitely the right thing to do.   More recently, I went TV shopping, and I had so many questions I wasn't even sure what to ask. I talked to Hilberto, and a couple of other salesman. They spent over an hour answering my questions and educating me on televisions. In past experiences, salesmen would have become bored and quit trying to help me.  All in all, nobody here really went above and beyond... they just did what one SHOULD do in a customer service field. So many places are employing people who are just there to collect a paycheck. This location has a good crew who never said "no" or "I don't know" but rather said "let me find out" or "I'm not sure, but my colleague might know." So I guess four stars for doing their jobs is a bit generous, but it really is very unexpected in this day and age.   Oh, the missing star is because of the douchenozzle manager. The large black guy who runs the store is obnoxious. I have watched him time and time again question employees who are going above and beyond to help me. He questioned the little asian guy who was discounting my computer to make me happy, and he questioned the computer guy who brought over a laptop to plug into a tv so I could see what it looked like on netflix. This guy needs to understand something... he works in customer service, when a customer has a question or a request and it's doable, it needs to be done. The employees here have done a great job to make this Best Buy my first choice for electronics shopping. Unfortunately, if the manager were helping me, he would have ran me off long ago.

Mr. Martin runs a clean, well run, competent shop. I don't really know how much you can say about an auto repair shop other than they get it right. They are a very honest and straight forward group, the shop is spotless, and their customer service skills are better than most mechanics. Plus, they have a cooler with complimentary soft drinks while you wait. How can you go wrong with that!?

They have a beer prayer outside on the wall, a weird nautical theme down to the tropical nook inside, and a really weird collection of customers. This place makes me wonder why I'd never come in sooner. It feels like a midwestern small town dive bar. Something you'd find in Springfield Illinois, or Elkhart Indiana. The young bartender was really friendly and they had pool and darts, plus it wasn't too busy. We had a great time here.

This is an unbelievable place. Supremely unique, surprisingly high quality, and has the most amazing atmosphere of any restaurant in the area.   The grotto bar downstairs, which you access through the stone encased stairwell, is the ultimate downstairs bar in Arizona. From the stamped copper bar top, to the fireplaces, and the dark sexy booths in back, it's the perfect place to rendezvous. Upstairs, you'll find an upscale version of what Richardson's was before it burned. Hardwood floors, adobe circular booths, wine cellar walls, another bar, and a beautiful fire make it a very intriguging dining room. They are users of Pandora Radio, so they have all sorts of variety playing over the airwaves.   The food is fantastic. Some of the highlights are the Rokerij Benedict, an english muffin topped with tenderloin, crab, egg, and jalapeno hollandaise. Try the Surf & Turf if you are truly hungry which is a couple of bacon wrapped shrimp, a crab enchilada, and a tenderloin. Both dishes are incredible, but perhaps not as much as some of the small plates you'll find, like the tenderloin toasts, topped with double creme brie, or the ubiquitous roasted garlic plate. Currently, they are also serving Richardson's menu, and in addition to the dozen or so specials on the chalk board nightly, one could dine here every day for a month and never have a duplicate meal.   Rokerij is a true neighborhood hangout with unique food, friendly people, and an atmosphere you cannot find elsewhere.

This is the best Pizza EVER! We order it here at work all the time and everyone loves it. For dine in it is nice too, and at lunch they do two types of service... if you want to get your food and get out you can order at the counter and they call your number. If you want to be served, they have waiter service too. It is a bit pricey, $18 per large pizza but well worth it.  PS, They DO deliver as of a couple months ago.  My manager says "MMMMMMMMMM"

Merc is a tough place to find, almost like a speakeasy... almost. You gotta know somewhat where it is because the only sign is a little 8.5x11 sized light that says "lounge"  Let me tell you about my last adventure at Merc. A friend and I were drinking at Armadillo down the street, and some random dude starts buying us drinks (I'm a male) so I make it clear to him I'm not interested. He just liked my friend (shes a female) so we went with it... free booze. Long story short, we shortly later went to Merc, and spent 3 hours there drinking. The guys bar tab was 600 bucks at Merc, to entertain the three of us, and the random occasional shots he bought for the others in the bar. I refer to it as the "drunken asshole adventure" because that guy truly was a drunken asshole, but like I said free booze. Other nights have yielded handshakes from Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire, Samuel L Jackson, etc. It's a good place to meet those with cool jobs. It's a pretty calm place too, one of my friends once was kicked out because they deemed him to be a little too lit up. So go here, behave yourself, and have a good time!

This is MY store. Not yours, or your neighbors, or her mom's, but MINE.   I love shopping at Trader Joe's. They carry plenty of bagged meals for two people that you can just heat up and eat. They aren't full of awful chemicals like at the grocery store, either. The people who work here are very friendly, and I don't get stressed out shopping here like I do at Safeway or Fry's, plus most things are cheaper. They seem to constantly run out of the Thai Chicken Noodle Salad though... not sure why they don't order more. Every time they get it in, people buy 5 or 6 boxes of it.

Ok so first of all, it seems like the girls taking the orders are always hot, kinda like at Pita Jungle. The food is good, not great, but definitely above average. It's a great healthy option and is much cheaper than Pita Jungle, which I've always thought was overpriced anyway. Lunch with a drink is usually under 8 bucks and always very quick. I don't understand the plastic cups for the soda, why not just give styrofoam ones, then people can take them with on the road... or is this because people will drink less soda? weird.  They skimp on quality of vegtables... most people think as long as you are eating veggies, you are doing a good job, oh no... not at all. Iceberg lettuce has no nutritional value at all. Fattoush and a few other places serve good lettuce. So yeah, better than Pita Jungle, but not as good as Fattoush.

Dined here 3 times and it has always been exceptional. I love the fact that they feature a game selection every night of the week, along with a constantly revolving tasting menu. Wine list is terrific and the food is very fresh. I understand they buy from farmers directly, rather than a food service company, which makes it A+ in my book.  Plus the Biltmore is just a beautiful place.

Of all the strip clubs in Phoenix I've been to, Bourbon Street is the one that always calls me back. Granted I've only been to a handful, albiet mostly the popular ones, this one is the best.   They have countless girls dancing and they are all really really friendly... and not that shiesty friendly where they just want your money (they have a few of those too) but actual genuinely nice people.   I was the only one out of about 7 people sitting by the stage that could get the girls bra off with one hand. They all tried and failed, I put one hand behind her back, and SNAP! Came right off, and then I wore it on my head for the rest of her dance as my titty champion crown.  They give out free popcorn, the beers are at least decently priced, and they have three states with the girls rotate through. You're seeing someone new about every 3-5 minutes. On the weekends you have to stay for at least an hour to see the same person come back on.

This review would be for the lounge only.  I found out they offer Taco Tuesday here and I was in like so fast. For $2 I got a tostada thing with shredded tenderloin that was oh so tender with a deep fried egg and some jalapeno sauce.  the service was spot on, they have the most delicious iced tea ever, and it's a beautiful place.

This place has the worst coffee ever, and their mass produced and over priced bagels aren't much better. I spent $6 on a bagel, cream cheese, and a coffee. Nope, not worth it. Not at all. Especially since their coffee tastes like watered down crap.

I salute you, Mr. Hard to Find Parking and Impossible to Get Help grocery store. You have enviable prowess in providing cramped spaces both out front, inside, and even around the neighborhood in which you reside. You make a mean pot of coffee, and you have a glorious array of sandwiches. If you were a Gerbil, you'd be the king of all gerbils in the kingdom. For that, I salute you.  LGO has been a family favorite for years ever since they opened. We used to go for lunch every week, and I'd eat the BLT every time, not because I'm not adventureous, but because it is THAT good. Whole wheat toast, a heaping pile of fresh bacon, and avocados. No BLT I've ever had, even ones at home, can touch it. The Commuter Sandwich with smoked salmon always hits the spot at 7 in the morning with my hot cup of Ethiopian Dark Roast. For dinner, you can't beat their pizza with anything other than a Chris Bianco pie. Yes, that's right, I said it, one of the best pizzas in town.   So why, after raving about all of these items, is LGO a four star establishment? Service inconsistencies, pricing, and parking. Numerous times, I've been annoyed by the LGO police, girls who think they have as much authority as a mall cop, because they work there. Get over yourself, you make $7 an hour to slang beans and sandwiches. You ain't no Vice Lord. It's a rare occurance, but it doe happen from time to time. LGO, just like your girls who work there, you need to realize the products you're pimpin aint hoes and crack. $9 for a breakfast burrito with no sides, $3 for a bottle of water, and $12 for a note book is obnoxious. I can go to Kmart and buy the same note book, sans the "made locally" stamp, for 99 cents. Parking is A to the trocious. You can't help that, minus .003 stars. Last but not least, please for the love of all that is holy, offer a bigger size for your iced tea. I'll gladly pay for it. Ask Luci, her healthy marketplace has an iced tea fit for a king.

Lunch time today I had a craving for Thai so I went there to try Thai Lahna for the first time. When I walked in I was not greeted by anyone for a number of minutes, so I sat myself and before being greeted by anyone my silverware, a menu, and water showed up. Maybe they like the element of surprise. I ordered the #11 lunch and thought it was very tasty. The quality of the veggies could have been better, and the cheap white rice didn't impress me much, but the taste of the sauce was delicious. The soup was also very good and for $8.12 it was a cheap meal. I would say Thai Hut was a little better, the the difference was miniscule, and I did like the service much better at Thai Hut.  3.5 stars

This is the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix. The place is very small and cozy, and decorated very warmly inside. They have a private nook in the back corner of the restaurant, as well as a full bar. Live music is featured most nights. All of the pasta is homemade fresh daily, and is very very good. One time they had Venison on the specials menu and it was so unbelievable I swear I can still taste it. Sima and Marcellino, the owners are great people, even if Marcellino is almost impossible to understand. The place is definitely not inexpensive, but in my opinion worth eveyry penny to actually get some high end Italian that is otherwise very hard to find in Phoenix.

It almost doesn't make sense reviewing a place that has 44 reviews and you're giving it what it averages, but I want to add my own two cents.   Carolina's is a dive hole in the wall, that I wonder how it is still standing. It is dirty, in a terrible neighborhood, and has no table service.   Knowing that before you go, you're in for a good meal! Their tortillas are incredible, and my favorite is the Chorizo and Potato burrito. The food takes a while to get, but it is so worth it. If you feel unsafe going here, there are always DPS, Sheriffs, PPD, PFD, etc. all over the place. It's probably the safest restaurant in town!  Delicious.

Update:  I don't mind $8.5 for wings as that is about average for a dozen wings. But when I get them and there are only 6, I'm never coming back to your restaurant. $17 for a dozen buffalo wings? HA! What the hell are you guys thinking?

I must be one of those "chumps" because I just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was terrible. First off, the parking situation is ridiculous. I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces.   When you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this.   Probably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English. I have no problem saying carne asada, but why type "grilled steak" on the menu if you don't want me to order it that way?

From the outside, Phu Thanh looks different from any other Vietnamese restaurant in town. It's larger, has a huge presence outside of the typical hidden strip mall, and looks promising.   Rest assured, Phu Thanh is different from most Vietnamese restaurants on the east side... it's very very bad. During a one-hour dinner in their dining room, I noticed three tables that were covered in dirty dishes upon my arrival, and still covered in the same dirty dishes upon my departure. Not to say this ruined my experience, but it sure was disgusting to look at. The waiter service here was actually nicer and more helpful than most, a which is the saving grace here. They offered a refill of my water (rare) and even came back to see if I needed anything else (very rare.) The clientele here seemed like predominately young married couples and young families of non-asian descent.   I had been craving a bowl of Bun all day, a rice noodle dish served with julienned veggies, your choice of meat, and a nuoc mam (fish sauce) to give it a nice flavor. I also ordered spring rolls  prior to my meal, and was a tad surprised when, having ordered in Vietnamese, the server asked me questions that made no sense. My order of Goi Cuon garnered a respose of "fried or not fried" which definitely threw me off since fried would be Gha Gio, an entirely different dish... did you ask this because I'm white? He then asked "you need fork right?" No, I just gave you my entire order and said hello in conversational Vietnamese... this wasn't a tip off that I know how to eat your food? The spring rolls were very small and contained little filling. I'm used to Goi Cuon bursting with veggies pork and shrimp, not little tiny thunb sized things. When the Bun came, the noodles were all broken, which made it almost impossible to eat in anything other than tiny bites. The Nuoc Mam had an overwhelming fish sauce smell and flavor and was easily the worst I've ever had, and completely lacked chili, garlic, or anything to mask the fish sauce. Utterly awful. I also felt like the Bun portion was incredibly small compared to other Viet restaurants in town.  I would hesitate to give this place any sort of recommendation, given it's proximity to some of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town. The quality seemed to be on par, and service was somewhat decent, but the combination of small portions, bad tasting food, and lack of ability to clean a table earns this restaurant a solid two-star review. Also, eating Vietnamese more than three times a week, I've had a good run of over two years and haven't become sick from a place. This one has had me burping for the past 12 hours and feeling kind of queasy... nothing major, but definitely something didn't sit well. I'm honstly not sure what the appeal of this restaurant is. Two miles away is Pho Ao Sen, one of the premier spots in the valley.

I don't think there is much you can't find at Lee Lee. Pho in a can? check. Single serving of Sake? check. Jarred Kim Chi? check.  Not only does Lee Lee have everything, but it's inexpensive too. This place makes the market at Chinatown look like amateur hour.

The North Course is one of my favorite courses around. The course is always in great shape, as they do not have any water restrictions (on the reservation) and no homes on it either so the mountain views are unobstructed. The course plays 7100 yards off the tips as a par 70 so it is a long sucker. They give you the fairways but you have to hit a decently long ball to score on this one. The bunkers are brutal and some you cant see out of. Their service has always been better than the other troon courses, especially troon north, where they treat everyone like scum. I may be partial to the course because I always score well here, but I think it is a blast to play, has great views, and I've never seen it in anything less than stellar condition. It's not We-Ko-Pa or Grayhawk, but dammit, it's a fun course.

I'd never been to Native New Yorker before, at any location, so the entire restaurant is new to me.  I was shocked walking in at how many TVs they had (so many they basically were the walls) and how much it seemed like a dive british pub with more lights. Whatever, we sat down kind of uncomfortably anyway thinking we were already here lets just go with it. Glad we did.  Yes, the place is sensory overload. So many televisions, the tv screen trivia game that I love so much, and just a really really loud room. I think even if the room were full of quiet people, it would still be loud as shit. So all this aside, we were having a blast.  The food is ok, it's not interesting by any means, but it is tasty, and my girlfriend really enjoyed her house special pizza. They have incredible drink specials including a Jack Hour every day from 10-11 where all jack drinks are stupid cheap.   Driving home in the car we agreed it was our favorite place to hang out that we have been to in a while. We sat for probably 2.5 hours playing tv trivia game, watching basketball, and eating. I'm usually hard to entertain when I am not drinking, but I didn't have a problem here.

This place is beyond overrated.  Why anyone would call this good BBQ is beyond me. I ordered all of their most popular items, as I usually do when trying someplace new. I was assured by our waitress that we were making the right choices. Maybe we chose wrong, but in the event we did make good decisions ordering, then the bad move was coming here in the first place.  My meal started with corn on the cob. It was mushy and watery. It seemed as though it was made MUCH earlier in the day. It should have been tossed instead of served to me. My beans were a saving grace, but were so basic that any place could have served them to me. Baked beans with meat in them... hmmm, tasty but not really innovative. The cornbread was a pathetic excuse for anything, as all it did was crumble and the "honey butter" they boasted was literally a bit of whipped butter with honey on top. It wasn't mixed, homemade, or anything positive.  My entree was the pulled pork dinner. I have to be honest here, the guy who owns this restaurant should burn it down and start over at something he is good at. Maybe he could make an ego stroking business instead... I say this because of the constant loop of his news and food tv spots on the tv. I'm sorry dude but if I'm already in your restaurant, you don't need to show me shows that tell me I should go to your restaurant. Maybe this logic escapes you. The pork was downright AWFUL. Fucking pathetic. It had no taste, it was dry, and the sauce that I tried to use to save it was tasting just like ketchup.  I say this in the nicest way possible, but you SUCK at BBQ. Go talk to Stacy and see if he will give you lessons. Just because you grilled at the family pot luck and everyone thought your food was tasty, doesn't mean you have any business starting a restaurant. You're no better than that episode of King of Queens where Kevin James makes good sandwiches and then tries to open a sandwich place and fails.  P.S. buy the girl with the midget legs but tall person torso some stilts so she doesn't look so out of place. She reminded me of a Corgi.  P.P.S. Your tivia is stupid. Instead of just putting the answer on the list, put down why the answer is what it is. The leading single game scorer is Wilt Chamberlain, you got the answer down, but why not put down how many points and when he did it? It's simple.

Seamus is a dive hole in the wall. I have been drinking there for almost a decade. Everything is overpoured, and you can fall off a barstool here and nobody will care. I've seen fights break out, been in fights, lost wallets on the walk home, etc. That said... it's my kind of place, just crappy enough to be awesome. I don't recommend the food, but if you want to go out with friends and really tie one off this is the place!

I love it! The diviest piece of crap hole in the wall, but they make the best food! The sweet and sour pork is actually chopped pork, with a heavy breading and cooked just right. So much better than the standard deep fried pork balls at other places. The egg rolls aren't actually wrapped, but they dip them batter and fry them without any wrapping. The soups are great, and the family dinners which come with soup, egg roll, and entree are a great value. The servers are pretty old chinese women that will not bend for anything... at all. We orderd a meal for two, and then asked to order a third one and she refused, saying they already started cooking it, and we would have to order another meal for two... odd. Also odd, is they have a birdcage with a fake cardinal in the center of the dining room. This is so far the best chinese I have found in Phoenix, a city that should be known for having no good chinese restaurants.

Wish these guys could get it right!  What a great place this so easily could be. It feels like a big city restaurant inside. The woman on the piano is a fucking genius, and I don't think she can be stumped. If you dine while she is playing, you will likely be like me and forget that the food is overpriced and mediocre.   Well, once she stopped playing, all focus went back on the food. My overcooked, white centered piece of "seared tuna" was utterly tasteless. The Wasabi mashed potatoes spoke nothing of wasabi, and my taste buds wondered why the fish tasted of fishyness the whole way through. My girfriend's chicken was one of the most disgustingly flavored dishes I'd ever tried, but she wasn't so upset with it... not mine, so I can't complain a lot.   Lackluster service, and attitude from the host didn't help either. I paid $60 of my hard earned money for two entrees and two iced teas and would have been happier eating a ham sandwich at home. At least that could have been prepared properly. If you can't sear tuna, then don't advertise it seared and ask me if rare is OK with me. This was not rare, it was freaking obliterated.

My first visit to Lo Lo's I have to admit, was totally against my will. It was my parents idea to take me there for my birthday a few years ago and I wasn't too keen on the idea. Now I'm a regular, at least as much as my stomach can handle it. The portions are enormous, and delicious. I always order the #2, it's smothered chicken with waffles, with a kool aid, and it is perfect. Probably going to give me a heart attack, but you gotta live! You gotta show up early, even on a weekday for lunch this place gets packed, and you have to wait outside where its hot. Probably 8 of my 10 visits have been on sunday mornings after a hard saturday night at Rose and Crown or another pub, so it hits the spot for those mornings perfectly.   Oh, and to those saying this place is good for groups, what the hell? It's a small restaurant that doesn't take reservations. What about that is good for groups?

Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge:  You might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box.  You might drink far too many pitchers of PBR.  You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only.  The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean it's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesn't take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Don't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, you'll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are.  If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!

In the words of the late great Colonel Sanders - "I'm to drunk... to taste this chicken."  I don't like fried chicken to begin with, but sometimes I'm in a hurry and KFC buffalo sliders just sound delicious. To tell you the truth, they are delicious, and that is the only reason this shit hole is getting two stars. I've often gone here and the place is closed when they should be open, the dining area is over the top messy, and the people who work there have got to be the dumbest of the dumb. I understand it is fast food, but this is like the bottom of the barrel. They would be the dumbest of the kids with down syndrome.  And they also have about 20 cats that live by the dumpster behind the restaurant. Poor kitties, having to eat KFC to stay alive.

I love Pino's for both dinner and lunch. They operate as an order at the counter type of place at lunch, and then at dinner utilize waiter service. When I lived in the neighborhood, I used to eat 2-3 calzones a week here. They also feature a couple of specials every night, and you should definitely order whatever the special is. His New York Style Hamburger is nothing short of amazing. The parking situation sucks, as they only have about 6 spaces for a restaurant that gets busy every night of the week. They hours are lame as well, M-F 11-2 and 5-8.... Pino... you gotta stay up later! To sum it up, the food is incredible, and they have a nice little beer/wine list, but just be aware of the short hours, small parking lot, and no cash policy.

Funny to write this and read the review below mine about Tuyen N's brother ridign a motorcycle.   This is the only hospital I really like. I would say the comparison between this and Good Sam is night and day. By contrast, Good Sam is gross. It feels shabby, and the people are unfriendly.  I've been to the ER at St. Joseph's twice. The first time was for a motorcycle accident. I was fine after the wreck but my shoulder kind of fell out of it's socket so I had to go. I was being seen by a doctor within 20 minutes of walking in on my own strength. The doctor was very nice and the nursing staff was great. Everyone joked with me and made me feel really comfortable. Riding a stretcher in a neck brace and wanting to look around on the way is impossible, BTW, just incase you want to try it cant be done.  My second visit was for a more severe thing. I had food poisoning from YC's Mongolian BBQ (read my review on that place) and shit/threw up so much that I became severely dehydrated. I couldn't walk on my own and while at Urgent Care they couldn't get an IV in me due in part to their own retardation. Well again, I was called back almost immediately at St. Joe's. They told me their ER is new and is designed to handle MANY more patients than the other hospitals and it shows. I got a total hottie doctor there! She wasn't interested in a guy who was in my state though... I was gross that day. The entire staff is made up of young, attractive, go getters. Not like Good Sam which is old, fat people who work in a gross hospital.   St. Joe's for me. I've told my girl that if I have a major emergency ever, to make sure I am taken there.

Da Vang (pronounced yah yang) is a hole in the wall in a sketchy ass strip mall next to the latin strip club and the Vietnamese Boba Tea shop. Weeknights and Weekends alike, this place is packed to the gills with Asian families, Mexicans from the neighborhood, and the few rogue gays and hipsters who wander in to try something ironic or obscure. Then you have the old Mexican ladies who walk by every table and put a car air freshener on it with a note explaining that you can buy it from her for $1. There are countless flies, the place hasn't been cleaned since Jesus was alive, and the parking lot almost requires four wheel drive. There isn't a more third-world dining experience in Phoenix.  My initial inpression was that this would be a fantastic trip to a Vietnamese wonderland. Seeing the types of people eating here, the extensiveness of the menu, and the overall ruggedness of it probably meant it was legit. I'm not Vietnamese, Asian, or any shade of yellow, but I like to think I still know my food well enough to say that it was an absolute let down. I ordered one of the most basic dishes, Pho Tai which is a beef broth with rice noodles and sliced beef. It's typically served with jalapeno rings, bean sprouts, basil, and lemon wedges on the side, yet mine was minus the jalapenos and lemon. Each table of Asian people who ordered the same thing both before and after me, received the said items with their meal. After my plate of half the veggies I need arrived, they brought by our spring rolls. Again, total disappointment. The sauce which accompanied them tasted like pure Hoisin, and I much prefer the typical peanut sauce or even a fish sauce. My girlfriend's bowl of Bun looked like the noodles were garbage, and was extremely short on veggies and meat.   Our server was nice enough, and rather typical of a restaurant of this type. They don't speak much, their way of asking if you'd like to order is saying "are you done?" After a while though, I realized he was a Spanish speaker, and then I realized he was of hispanic heritage, nice. I come to this Vietnamese place and there are Mexicans working both front and back of the restaurant. Made me want some enchiladas. Overall, this restaurant was a complete let down and if it hadn't been for the very low price (under $20 for two people) I'd have been very upset. I'll keep sticking with Little Saigon, Pho Thanh, Koai Hoan, and Dong A.

I am recovering from the Recovery Room as I write this. Recovery Room is one of those places that I've driven by for a decade and always wanted to stop, but due to it's location, never have. Last night, I got the opportunity, and it was actually more interesting and less "alcoholic bar" than I expected.   When I walked in, I was drawn to the busy looking atmosphere, all the games, and lack of music which was actually weird. We saddled up at the bar and the first thing I noticed was a lack of draft, which the bartender referred to as "dirty beer." Ok, we aren't off to a good start, no music and no drafts. Just after, the bartender poured exactly one jigger full of Jack Daniels for my Jack and Coke. She was very slow, methodical, and really really new. I had to help her find Jack Daniels on her computer screen. "It's Bourbon!" I proclaimed, and when she hit the BOURBON button, she asked what I ordered again. I was half tempted to say well bourbon, but I was honest with her. This place is a mess I thought quietly to myself, and then I turned around and noticed a big screen TV with FREE ROCK BAND 2 on XBOX. OK, all is forgiven... everything, all of it, I'm going to play Rock Band now, kthx.   I played drums, Erika played guitar, and Cokie the Clown (I don't know his real name) was on the vocals. He emphatically sang through Lady GaGa, Journey, Disturbed, and various other songs while dancing, performing, and sniffling from the cocaine.... a lot. He departed long before we did, and it gave us an opportunity to talk to this slow bartender again, who turned out to be a very nice person who we enjoyed chatting with.   Recovery Room made a slow and bad start, but then completely recovered. Now I just need to make the same recovery.

Go on the 21 and up side only to drink. It's always fatty dance night in there. The girls on the 18+ side are pretty smokin' for the most part. The place is a little dirty, but it's ok. The clientele is sometimes creepy, but again just mind your own and you will have fun.

First off, I have to admit I've never purchased any weapons here, but I have infact purchased plenty of accessories, range time, and took my CCW course here.   The employees have always been beyond helpful, almost seemingly bored and need something to do. They will shoot the shit with you all night if you let them. The range I actually like better than Gun Club or Caswell's. It's more managable than Gun Club, and a lot nicer than Caswell's. The range time is also very inexpensive. I once came here with my mom on a Friday night ladies night. She was able to rent a handgun and get range time complimentary, the whole night cost her only ammunition, and a sore arm... give a 56 year old woman a .40 XD and see what happens... lol. I'm giving this place two stars because of their bull crap "case your weapon" policy. Even if you are a CCW holder, they want you to unload and case your weapon. Let me ask you something... Is this to make sure that I don't rob the place? because if that were my intention, I'd ignore the sign anyway. Are they afraid I am going to try to clear the weapon in the store and accidentaly shoot someone? Then maybe make CCW holders exempt from the rule, as we are trained in proper weapons handling. I give it 4 stars if this rule were not in existence. Both Gun Club and Caswell's let you holster your weapon.

I have been a customer of the restaurant since I was a little kid and my parents would take me here. After just two or three trips, they will remember your name, where you are from, what you like to order, how you want it cooked, and anything else you volunteer to tell them. It's pretty amazing. The food is fantastic, and much better than any other vietnamese restaurant I have found in phoenix. The bun has a lot more vegtables and substance than most I have tried. The peanut sauce and spring roll sauce are both incredible.   It's your typical dive asian place. Busted up floor tiles, glass table tops, and next to no atmosphere. It's all about the food, and the perfect service (assuming they are not busy.) It's also very inexpensive. A family of 4 can eat dinner for less than 40 bucks including soft drinks. The only downside I can think of is the neighborhood, it is located next to a coin-op laundry which attracts lots of ghetto types.

I grew up playing Maryvale, from when I was 5 I took John Martin's Summer Swing School. It would be all day on the golf course, kind of a summer camp kinda deal. I probably have played here 200+ times over the past 20 years. There have been a lot of changes both for the good and the bad.  This is a classic William Bell design, with elevated tees and greens, mostly bunkered in the front. It's compact in design and everything flows together well, and there are some great risk reward opportunities. Some of the standout holes are:  #3, a great 420yd par 4 dogleg right. It is really tempting to try to cut the corner, and if you hit a right side drive high enough, you can carry the mounds and trees and leave yourself a short wedge in. Hit in the trees and its an easy bogey.  #5 is a very tempting driving hole. at 302 yards one can put the ball on the green if you hit even a somewhat long ball. If you miss either way, you'll have a tough time saving par. I've probably had less pars here than any other hole on the course, its always birdie or bogey.  #13 is very much the same situation as 5, but you have a huge bunker in front of the green. Again, a big shot off the tee can put you in a great birdie position, or a nice cut will put you on the green, but bogie is easy.   The place is never in good shape, but the course is fun, it's cheap, and appropriate for the advanced player or a beginner. The course is as tough or as easy as you want it to be. My days of shooting consistent low 70's are over here, but I still have fun.

You have not lived until you have had Cafe Sarajevo's sausage sandwiches. I had a lot of Bosnian friends in high school, and one kids mom used to make these for us all the time but damn, this place does it right. It's a hole in the wall, order at the counter, but it is cheap, and delicious. Lunch for two 16 bucks with drinks. Can't beat that many places other than Arby's. I strutted what Bosnian I do know, which isn't much, but was enough to help make change for American money and order my sandwich in the right language.

This is a great market, with a great selection of dry goods as well as foodstuff. The people inside the store are very helpful and are willing to make special orders if you know just what you want. I will admit, I'm puzzled by what the recording says when I walk in/out, and by what some of the stuff says as I have no understanding of how to read ideograms but great place nonetheless. I've been addicted to Ramune since Matsuri festival last year and this is only one of two places I've seen it since. They have a small selection of sake and beer, but most importantly, all the "junk food," spices, noodles, etc.   do atishi mashite New Tokyo!

My family and I frequented Golden Greek at least once weekly growing up, though I hadn't been in at least 5-8 years, until last night.  It's EXACTLY how it was 10 years ago. It's a dive, neighborhood hole in the wall. Small, quiet restaurant, with basic and tasty Greek and Italian food. I had the Pasta Napoli last night and it was tasty, as were the spanikopitas and the garlic bread. Our hummus was very watery and chunky... would not order again.   The people who run the place, and have ran it forever, are completely indifferent. They slam glasses and plates on your table, say "what do you want?" and tell you "good customers get their own to go boxes." It's not that they are unfriendly, but they just have a different way about them. You're in the restaurant and they treat you as they would family or friends, rather than kissing your ass for being in their place. I like that charm a little bit.   I don't think anything here is really home-made, rather they are just putting together ingredients they have warmed up, but it is good!  And CHEAP!

writing this while I'm in the restaurant, so bear with me.  Walked in and this place is making me feel right at home. Its very small, not fancy, but has a little homey feel to it. Seems like a place that should be in the city, not a strip mall in the burbs. There wasn't anyone to greet me so I had a seat where I wanted, and the place is basically empty so they didn't mind. Chips came out, eh, nothing special and I'll probably liken the salsa to that of macayos. Not bad, just nothing special. I ordered the sobrosomethingicantpronounce, and an empanada de puerco. I can never pass those up when I see them.   the empanada was delicious, with a perfect crust. It was a bit sweet, and a bit tangy, the pork cooked in a green chili sauce really set it off. So far so good I am thinking, and I just heard the bell ring signaling my meal is ready...  so I just finished up my main course. Delicious, the meat perfectly cooked and fell apart with a fork, and the vegtables over it almost tasted sweet as almost there was plantain in it. In whatever case, very well executed. I did not care for the white sauce over the potatos, and found it rather bland. The main dish was great overall. Service was perfect from start to finish, though eight now I am the only one in here, so not sure what it would be like I'd they were busy.  +1 for great service +1 for making me feel at home +1 for a great meal

Went here yesterday for lunch while my car was at MINI being serviced. The place for starters has no feeling of arrival. There is just a door on the side of a building with no awning, patio, etc. There was no one there to greet me when I came in so I made my way over to the bar. There were a couple of middle aged women running the bar and doing a mediocre job of it at best. I ordered the chimichilada, MAN, you gotta REALLY like mushrooms to eat that thing. The chimi part of it was ok, but nothing really to write home about. This place has been dubbed a direct competitor to Richardson's? get real. The chips were the only good part of my meal. I'm a big guy with a big appetite, and I didn't even have a desire to finish my meal, it was just not a good dish. Besides the food, the restaurant was just really akward in layout. The bar top seemed as if it were a removable piece of furniture from Ikea... not cool. One of the waitresses even had her two kids hanging out in the restaurant running back into the kitchen, eating, etc. Pretty sure that would violate some sort of health code. I'll stick to Richardson's thank you.  UPDATE 6/26/08:  Went here to please my co-workers... they all wanted to go after taliesin west tour so I figured I would give it another shot. Worse than the first time... the service was worse, the chips and salsa was worse, and the food was even more bland. Not as many mushrooms though. I'm gonna keep it at 2 stars though, because I hate to give out onesies.

Bouncers beating the crap out of helpless drunks - check  Bouncers taking away my friends ID that was not fake - check  Overzealous, arrogant, and brutal. I got no problem with it. I'm a type A personality so I'm all for knocking someone down a peg if they step out of line. My ID is real, I control myself when I drink, and I'm not a hellraiser, so I've NEVER had a problem at Dos. The food is tasty and pretty cheap, they have every beer you'd ever want, and an awesome rooftop bar. One of my favorite bars in the area still, but I wish it were closer to the city. I hate not being able to let loose here on a count of drinking and driving.

I've visited Cowboy Ciao many many times in the past and have always enjoyed it.   Nowadays, it felt like an abortion must feel like to a 15 year old. The food was absolutely horrific. Sure, the Stetson Chopped Salad was tremendous as always, but my duck and brie sandwich as well as my girlfriend's papardelle pasta were flavorless messes.   The service at Cowboy Ciao was the saving grace. I didn't get our servers name, but he was cordial and efficient. I'm going to give it one more shot for lunch, since for years it was my favorite lunch spot in Old Town, and I hate to lose it. It really was just awful though.  1 star for food but 4 for service.

I was going to call this place a bad rip off of Richardson's and chastize it for being so, until the owner told me she used to work for him and "proudly stole" some of his concepts. Whatever, I don't care as long as your food is good.   Ordered the Carne Adovada... bland, dry, and boring. Other diners at the table had similar sentiments about their food. Chips and salsa shared at the table was more what I'd expect to find in New York City. No spice, no flavor, and runny as all get out. I guess I should expect all of this lack of flavor and spice, as this place is obviously appealing to tourists who aren't used to our spices. This was further proved by the goofy bats all over, the fake caves, and the awful service which is so typical of a tourist trap.  TOURIST TRAP. Avoid if you're a local. If you're from the Midwest or East Coast, you'll find it charming.

5 visits to Don & Charlie's and I can form an opinion finally. Well, thats not all true, I had a good opinion formed after the first visit but kept coming back because everyone sang such high praises. In all honesty, I have to wonder about the people singing praises of this place. Are they the same people that think TGI Friday's is a nice night out? Red Lobster is good seafood? A phenomenal upscale night out is Cheesecake Factory? They must be.... MUST BE.  Now before you all go screaming how you are insulted because you like Don & Charlie's, hear me out. They are part of a chain of 35 restaurants called Lettuce Entertain You, cute. The other Phoenix location they own is Maggiano's Little Italy, which is always forgetful. From the moment you walk in and are coldly greeted by a teenage girl, who is only there because daddy wants her to have a job to prove she is mature enough to drive the BMW he just bought her for sweet 16, one has to wonder what they are in for. Is this going to be a fun-filled evening with wacky sports memorabilia all over the walls and fun servers? Are you going to be taken into the wacky world of Chicago/Phoenix sports history? Are you in for the best BBQ you've ever had? Hardly.  Despite warnings from a co-worker whom had been prior to my visit that said the tough and dry ribs won't come off the bone despite any efforts you make, I ordered them. He was right. With me done trying to separate the meat from the bone, and giving up, I put the bone down, still covered in meat. The ribs came with a chicken schnitzel that had pretty much zero flavor, at all. Next visit dad and I both ordered Prime Rib, ate about 2/3 of it and both agreed that eating the rest just wouldn't be worth it. Another visit we ordered a shrimp cocktail, a couple of steaks, wedge salads, calamari, and a few other odds and ends. The 4 of us that night spent quite some time in the bathroom at our respective homes.   The service has never been really friendly, to say the least, but usually spot on helpful. On my 5 visits, I've had 3 different servers. One, a large middle aged gentleman, is the most matter of fact guy I've probably ever encountered. Just not the personality for a server and while I understand where he is coming from, my guests thought he was downright rude. Another, an older woman, likes to slam stuff onto your table, without saying a word. I'm sorry, I expect you to be nice to me. Maybe you could be more like the *runners* at Applebee's and tell me what you are putting in front of me and ask me if I want anything else. Sad that you don't even stack up to a food runner at Applebee's, a place that I'll never give an endorsement to. Stop giving me the cold shoulder. I'm not your enemy, in fact we have never met.  I understand Don & Charlie's for what it is. It is a restaurant that appeals to two crowds. One crowd is the elderly who want blander foods because they don't like the spices. I can understand that, and it's only fair they have a place to go. They go here because they know what they are going to get, have a great choice of early-bird specials, and will never get indigestion from spices. Old people tend to be incontinent anyhow, so they are likely to not notice the diarrhea they get afterward. The second group is tourists/people hosting tourists who go for the kitschy sports atmosphere, and accept that the food is less than average and or don't really care. Maybe some of these people aren't interested in quality and just think food is food. I have a buddy who swears it is the best steakhouse in town. He is also the same guy who eats Taco Bell, Applebee's, Outback, Etc. on a regular basis because they are the best places in town. There is something to be said for people with no taste buds, they are way easy to please!

I love it. On our visit, the remodel wasn't quite done, but you couldn't see anything from inside the restaurant and thye had just rolled out a new menu that had a lot of really interesting looking options.   We sat in one of the booths down by the window and had a great view of the valley and the mountains below us. Our server was freakin awesome and brought us these little bread things with some sort of hummus, it was great. I ordered the short rib ravioli and ended up practically licking my plate clean. There could have been a bigger portion, but if I had ordered an appetizer or salad like I should, it would have been a perfectly sized meal.   When they get the patio opened up and the private dining room they have pictures of by the door, this will be a seriously legit contender in the valley dining scene. I'd say they are easily top 10 for overall experience right now anyway.

This is without a doubt the best overall package of a restaurant in Phoenix. I honestly cannot think of a better patio. Whether it be lunch or dinner, it is gorgeous. The signature dish, beef tenderloin over white truffle macaroni and cheese is one of my favorites in the whole city. I could eat three of them no problem. They offer a teriffic wine list, and have a number of my favorite scotches as well. The place is situated in  a 35 room botique hacienda inn, original Arizona adobe architecture. It was once the home of Lon Mcgarge, the western artist credited for the artwork on the Stetson hat. Great place for a special event, romantic evening, or just to treat yourself. They will bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. I have only recieved in my 7 times dining there, one bad piece of service, later to find out it was the kids very first day. I don't like the mandatory valet parking, but I can understand why they do it, their lot isn't very large for a hotel. I can't imagine anyone not liking this place.

Stayed one night at Hermosa Inn about 10 days after the reopening. Apparently most rooms underwent a big time remodel and ours was one of them.  Our room had about a 20 foot ceiling with skylights, a patio which opened out to a semi-private hot tub, and a gas fireplace. I'd say it was around 750 sq. ft. and I only say because that is the size of my old condo, and it seemed roughly the same. The bathroom the size of most bedrooms with a seperate room for the toilet, huge soaking bathroom, double sinks, and HUGE shower with dual showerheads.   The grounds are gorgeous and very well manicured. This property is lush with lots of trees and grass, and is a beautiful respite from the desert surrounding it. Service is very friendly and they have a certain casual attitude that is perfectly accommodating. It's a quiet, peaceful hotel that we really enjoyed. The beds are unbelievablely soft and comfy here too.  This is a perfect hotel I think for someone who will be visiting the area and has a lot of activities planned for their visit. They are not full service (no spa, no rec department) but they are a gorgeous property.

An average review that wont sway the scales is in order.   I took my mom here for mothers day a couple of years ago and had an absolutely awful experience, which embarrased me beyond belief. The bag boys were rude, the pro shop was unjustly impatient, the snack bar was closed (they said it would be open,) and the drink cart did not come by one time during our entire round. We even called the pro shop from cell phones to complain on about the 12th hole saying there was no water in the drinking water jugs on the course, the cart girl had never come by, and the bathrooms were all locked and the cart key did not open them. The guys in the shop were apologetic, and said they would send someone right out to help us, but we didn't see anyone. On the 14th hole, the ranger came by and he had some towels which kept us cool, and we let him know how disappointed we were that the drink cart wasn't coming by, the snack bar was closed, and there was no water in the drinking water jugs. Basically that we could not get water, and it was 100 degrees outside! He apologized profusely and said he would see us on the next hole with waters and bathroom keys, but we never did see him the rest of the round.  When we got back to the clubhouse, the bag boy was sitting on a chair under an umbrella watching us take the bags off the cart and stare him down. I'm sure he realized we were pissed he wasn't doing his job, but he offered no apologies or assistance. I later told someone in the pro shop about all the problems we had and he basically told us that we should expect this in the summertime.   I've played golf for 20 years in Arizona, and most of it in the summer because I can actually afford to play then, and never had such an awful experience. I felt like I was playing on a closed golf course. A letter to their director of golf Joe Shershanova got a written apology and a comp round, but it didn't make up a ruined mothers day that I spent a lot of my hard earned money on... I don't make much.  The second experience was average.

How have I lived in Phoenix all my life and never been here?  Talk about an awkward location, perched in the middle of a residential neighborhood by some old defunct railroad tracks, but inside Four Peaks is an awesome spot. They have TVs at every turn and it doesn't matter where you are inside, you can see at least a couple of them. They have a patio that is terrific patio for people watching, and since the place is so busy, you can do plenty of that.  The beers here are delicious, I especially like the Hop Knot, and their food is slightly above average. I didn't care for my burger too much, but I thought the pasta salad it was served with was the shit. I could eat that alone for my meal.   Service at Four Peaks is also great. They have quite a few hot bartenders working at a time, and one of them was great at asking peoples names and trying to remember them from previous visits. She was onto me in like 5 seconds figuring out that I'm not from Tempe. How the hell do you get that? It's not like I look like a tourist in a Diamondbacks hat and my jacket on a 65 degree day in the Arizona afternoon.   I'll go back, and shhhhh don't tell anyone but it's only 1/2 mile from the Dorsey/Apache station.

Right across the street from two Tempe favorites, Cornish Pasty Co., and Cheba Hut, Lalibela completes a triangle of great Tempe spots.  This restuarant is better than Blue Nile in every way. It's nicer, the food is better, the portions are larger, and the service is nicer.  The prices are very reasonable too, and their sourdough like bread is tremendous.

A sober Saturday night when all my friends were out drinking led me to this restaurant. 30 minutes on the train and a 5 minute walk and I was here. Upon walking in, I had high hopes.   Khai Hoan has the typical "we aren't trying to impress anyone" Vietnamese restaurant atmosphere. It was filled with a lot of Asian folks speaking their native tongue, unlike a lot of places full of whitey.  The woman who owns the place was very cordial and although her english was somewhat broken, she was tremendously helpful to me. A walk through the kitchen to wash my hands revealed how clean the place has to be kept. Obviously they wouldn't want anyone walking to the restroom and seeing a dirty kitchen. Hopes still high!  My bowl of bun came, #19 ($7.25) with egg rolls and pork, my usual bowl at any Vietnamese restaurant. Usually, the bowl is oversized, giving you room to mix up your ingredients once you put your favorite condiments on it. Unfortunately, the bowl was packed to the brim so I had to make some adjustments on how i eat the dish. As for taste, the overwhelming flavor of barbecue pork dominated everything in the bowl, which was a delicious flavor, but somewhat disappointing that I couldn't taste the sauce.  This restaurant is also in a pretty skeezy neighborhood. I'd forgotten how long it has been since I have encountered your run of the mill trailer park white crack/meth heads in public. They kind of scare me. I'd rather deal with a drunk bum anyday.   +2 for the service  -1 for the overwhelming taste of barbecue -1 for the awful neighborhood

Never have I been so disrespected by an employee at an establishment.  Maybe you should think about how you make money, and how creating a bad rap for yourself hurts only you.  I went in last night for one beer about 9pm and sat at the little outside bar deal in the back. The female bartender was passing out calendars and drink coupons to everyone at the bar EXCEPT me. She totally skipped over me and when I asked "where's mine" I got a total fucking attitude. She told me I never asked for one and I explained I'm not a mind reader and she should have offered. She didn't offer to get more, she didn't apologize, whatever. A couple minutes later the couple two stools down from me said this is a great calendar and I replied that I wouldn't know. The bartender then flipped out and started telling the couple, not me, how she has no problem "owning these stupid ASU kids that can't handle their liquor." Way to judge, bitch. I'm not an ASU student and I've only had 1/2 beer at this point.   I called for a manager and told him I have 1/2 a beer left, I'm not paying for it, I'm leaving and never coming back, and I'm going to tell everyone I know about how rude your bartender is.   He gave me all sorts of free coupons for the block party, $1 drink coupons, and of course that calendar I wanted. I'm still not going back, ever, no matter hot skankily hot the cocktail waitresses are.

This place just gets it. The older guy who runs the shop is the best, and goes above and beyond. I've only been in the shop twice, both for little odds and ends and it's a stark comparison between this shop and the Landis shop down the street.  First visit I went in to buy a Clif Shot and the guy told me to go fill my camelback in the sink and offered to top off my tires since he knew I was on a really long 50+ mile ride. That was really awesome. Second visit I went in because I had repaired a flat with my Co2 and needed to buy a new spare tube for my pack and a new canister. He grabbed my bike and let all the Co2 out and topped it off with air, then adjusted my brake, then told me to fill my camelback up, and then helped me find a route to my destination in south chandler.   This guy is a lesson in customer service for all of the arrogant bike shop employees out there, which is most bike shop employees.

Why do I keep returning to UNO restaurants??  Oh yeah, because I am a borderline alcoholic and I like their happy hour specials, but that is where it ENDS.  I always thought the one by my house was just poorly managed and probably not indicative  of the rest of the chain... WRONG.  This place has the NASTIEST restrooms, consistently, and smells like shit throughout the restaurant. Never again.

What in the hell were we thinking by going here?  This place would be at home on the street with Pink Cadillac, Manny's, etc. in Rocky Point. This bar was dirty, cheaply made, had sticky floors, and when I was there had nothing going for it other than a very friendly staff. The doorman made conversation with my girl and the waitresses made conversation with me. We both felt welcomed, but it was like being welcomed to the projects in Bronx, it was just super ghetto.

mmm mmm mmm mmm!  Came for my birthday lunch with my parents because it was close to the train and the only place that was decently upscale in Tempe. The restaurant was not very busy before the Insight Bowl, I'm assuming everyone was tailgaiting, so we didn't need the reservation we had made. We chose an inside table and the inside of the restaurant is reallly nice. Reminds me of being in one of the old homes in downtown restaurants.   Our waitress was incredibly nice, and went almost over the top to make sure we were taken care of. We were her only table, but most of the time when people aren't busy, that brings out their worst. She knew the menu extremely well, and was able to recommend wines to go with our lunch without looking at the menu, which shows either she was trained, or really likes her job and took the time to learn the list.   My Osso Bucco was one of the best I have ever had, rivaling that of Cafe La Bella, which is no longer open. It was served with a creamy polenta and a great burgundy wine sauce. I'd go back just for that dish alone. The other plates at the table were a meatball panini which was well liked, and the Pola Pola which was a duo of raviolis. The dishes were all tasty, and well presented. We wished we had ordered a first course though, as the portions were incredibly, incredibly small. They are serving small farm and organic products, so obviously their food cost is a bit higher. To serve Cheesecake Factory size portions, they would have to charge $50 for lunch.   This restaurant would probably do exceptionally well downtown, with its historic, homey charm and the organic healthy menu options. Hopefully the owners will try it, and I'll not have to travel to come back here, which may happen a lot.

This company is absolutely amazing. We went on a horseback ride with them in the Cave Creek desert and both my girl and I are novice but they brought horses which were so well trained it was a breeze to get on and start riding. I was nervous for about 10 minutes and then ready to do a little trotting, and my horse didn't require a kick like the stable horses I'd ridden in the past, rather just a little pressure and he was off. They are not cheap, but you get what you pay for as the horses are all personal pets not stable horses. Our guide owned his own and had four of them, all arabian and gorgeous.

If you have 5 hours to kill for dinner, Pizzeria Bianco may be your best bet. I've been going here for years, since Chris' place was in Town & Country mall, next to my other old favorite Coyote Springs Brewing Co. You could go in for lunch and not have to wait one bit. I don't even remember if he was open for dinner, but damn we used to go 2-3 time a week for lunch.   So flash forward to when Jerry Colangelo coaxed him into moving downtown, as part of Jerry's dreams of a DisneyLand downtown. The waits got longer and longer, and as of about two years ago were still tolerable. The last time I went was just before the Oprah/Martha Stewart mess, and at 9:45 only waited 40 minutes for a table. People wait longer at Oregano's. This is no longer possible though as half the time they cut off the names at 8-9pm if they realize they are going to be there to 1am to accommodate everyone. I'd say average weekday wait is 2 hours, weekends 3+. I can ONLY, and I mean ONLY justify this because I live across the street.  The food is amazing, and literally the perfect pizza. The crust is perfect, the ingredients all extremely high quality and homemade much of the time. Gotta love the Shriner's Sausage as well. I like Cibo's Antipasta better, but everything else about Bianco nudges them out. One thing you can count on too is no matter how busy Chris is, he will absolutely aknowledge and smile at you. It's that kind of thing, letting someone know you appreciate their business even though you don't need it, that really counts.   Even with the awesome food, and fun ambiance, is it worth the wait? I'm not sure any pizza is worth waiting 3 hours for, and like I said, if I wasn't able to walk home, watch a movie, and then come back, I'm not sure I'd go back. You can go to Cibo and have no/little wait... sure it isn't as good, but I have to question if any pizza is that good. Try it once at least, and be your own judge. You owe it to yourself.

1960, meet.... 1960.  Durant's has not departed from that era, and I'm glad it hasn't. From the entrance along the red carpet in the kitchen, to the velvet covered walls, high back red booths, and staff in tuxedos, you know you are in for a treat as soon as you walk in. Hell, even the line cooks will wave hi and bye to you.   Featured in the bar every afternoon is a killer happy hour, with half price domestic and well drinks. They typically draw a pretty good crowd that doesn't seem to let up until late in the evening. A lot of the clientele here is the well heeled group from Phoenix Country Club, Palmcroft, and other nicer neighborhoods. It's a diverse group from 20 somethings to the about to die blue hairs.   The honest truth, as others have said, is that you can find a better steak. I would barely put Durant's in the top 10 with stars like Donovan's, Mastro's, BLT, J&G, etc. But Durant's isn't all about the steak, it's about the experience, one every phoenician should encounter at least once in their lifetime. The owners aren't the least bit accommodating either, as they don't have to be. The restaurant fills up almost every night.   I still maintain that if it weren't for Durant's, a lot of people wouldn't even know what Central Avenue in Midtown looks like. I hear very often, oh, downtown, thats by Durant's right? Long live a Phoenix landmark.

200+ tequilas, one of the only places for cochinita pibil, and amazing tableside guacamole with pomegranate seeds.   This restaurant is amazing. Don't go here if you are one of those schmucks looking for a chimichanga with rice and beans all topped with red sauce and cheese. This is real Mexican food, not some American creation that the bible belt thinks is Mexican. I've actually heard people say this place doesn't serve Mexican food, where are the enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. Go to school!  I've eaten cochinita pibil just about everywhere that serves it, and I've made it on my own. This place does it WELL! The atmosphere is interesting and fun, but the place can get really really really busy.  Go early and enjoy, and sunday brunch is great as well with live music.

So it may or may not be normal, but I had an incredibly inconsistent experience here the other night.   Lux has a primo location, next to Pane Bianco, just off a train station, and in a great neighborhood. They have a great patio which they share with Bianco, that even though it is loud, it is a nice spot to hang out.   Their coffee prices are more than fair, $2 for a large coffee, and decent tasting. The biggest thing was not having to pay additional tax, as they have worked it into the prices. I never realized how angry it makes me when something is like $2.03 and I have to walk around with a pocketful of change all day. So those are all the plusses, but I've had a few negative reports as well.  This may or may not be normal, but on my visit, it was a like an akward library. They did not have any music on, there was little to no conversation between customers, and it was very quiet. I also couldn't get past the blatant violation of fire code on the way to the restroom. They had piles and stacks of dishes in the hallway and I almost bowled one of them over because someone decided to try to pass me while I was next to one.

It's a given that most of us have been in the family style Chinese restaurants in the past, and most of us will remember sitting and finding out what animal you and your friends are on the chinese calendar. Golden Phoenix harkens back to those memories like no other place in town. The service is impeccible, and the owner of the restaurant remembers everyone who walks in the door, and epitomizes great service from a restauranteur.   The food here at Golden Phoenix is your standard Chinese fair, nothing too authentic, but I hear they have a separate menu they provide to Chinese people. I've tried their Sweet & Sour Pork ($8.75) which was great, and had a very gingery sauce a little different from what I'm used to. Cashew Chickn and Kung Pao Chicken ($8.25) are both good dishes, but lacking in the sauce flavor department. Both dishes had plenty of veggies, chicken, and nuts, but were fairly bland overall. Hot & Sour soup is one of the best I've ever had, and they include plenty of medium sized shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, etc. I've had better tasting and better quality food elsewhere, but the difference is absolutely marginal.  Overall, I'd say this is a great place to go for a good ol' fashioned Chinese/American meal with your family or friends. They have a full bar complete with signature drinks like the Chinese Itch, Zombie, and Typhoon. What makes this restaurant special to me is the sense of familiarity you get from the staff, even if you've only been once or twice, such as the case with me.

The fire factory, as I like to call it, is now open on Sundays for Sunday Funday. It's too bad this location is the only one open on Sundays.   Los Dos Molinos takes spicy to a new level. Some of the dishes here, even for a native of Phoenix, are so hot they are inedible. I've had everything on the menu, multiple times, and my favorites are the Mexican Pizza, Carnitas, Garlic Shrimp, and the Red Beef Burro Enchilada Style. The Jalapeno green salsa is incredible as well.   They serve up some great margaritas, though for the best margs, visit the Washington Street location as they seem to be better at mixing. There is a reason Los Dos has been around for as long as it has, and has received all of it's national press.

My family and I have been to this property for brunches 3 times now. The first two times we went, it was incredible, and definitely one of our favorites in town.  The view is the best. I enjoy Sanctuary's view all day 5 days a week, and as awesome as it is, I think Copperwynd/Alchemy Restaurant might have a better one. It is a small, trendy, dining room with floor to ceiling windows that can be rolled up to make the entire dining room open to the elements. It is located off the lobby, but has a very cozy entry way which seperates it just enough to make you feel as though you aren't in a resort.  Our first visit back in 2006 was a champagne brunch that featured one of the best seafood selections we had seen at a brunch. Coming from my family, that's saying a lot, as they do brunches all the damn time. The food was incredible that day with perfect service. The second visit was much the same.   This time though...  One salad looked as though they opened a bag of Redi-Mix and dumped it in a bowl. The quality of their seafood display is now down to shrimp cocktail, smoked oysters/salmon, and crab legs. The actual fish quality is decent, and just decent.   Service on this visit was really hit and miss as well. The executive chef came out and talked to every table, and the bussers were spot on with drink service and clearing plates/folding napkins when you went for another food run. On the flip side of that, our waitress had us waiting for new silverware, and bringing my mom the wrong type of hot tea twice. Also, the kid behind the prime rib carving station needs to be taught customer service. He literally stared at me from when I was 10' from the station up until I got there. I waited for him to greet me and it never happened so finally I started putting horseradish on my plate hoping he would get the point and he started carving meat. Not a big deal, but it was just a lot of little stuff that piled up. Perhaps the biggest thing is they have done away with the champagne, and didn't lower the price of the buffet.   I'm fine with the service, food, and having to pay for my champagne if you don't charge me $54 per person for the buffet. Wrigley Mansion has their buffet priced at $62 with a MUCH more elaborate selection, live music, champagne, and a staff that is as close to perfect as it gets. Sorry Copperwynd, but if you guys are trying to scale back, you're doing it in the wrong place... quality is not a place to skimp!

Lee's Sandwiches caught me a little bit off guard. I wanted to go there so bad and had a bit of a vision of what it might look like, and boy was I wrong. Vietnamese restaurants are always dirty, run down, and seemingly ill-maintained. Lee's couldn't be any different, it's clean, shiny, and efficient. Ordering takes place at the counter, and they have about 20+ sandwiches you can choose from, both american and vietnamese. Vietnamese are under $3 and american are over $4 and not nearly as delicious.   I wasn't courageous enough to try the signature Lee's Combonation, because it has Head Cheese (it's not cheese) and I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to that stuff. I had decided before I went that I would have the Grilled Pork, they were out, so as a back up I ordered the BBQ pork, which they were out of. I settled for Shredded Pork, and it was fairly good.  I'm going to go back and order something that fits my tastes, but as of now based on my experience there, it's only 3 stars. The shredded pork sandwich wasn't tremendous, and they were out of too many things. Shouldn't happen. For price and cleanliness though, this place is great.

If you have $6 burning a hole in your pocket, and would like a thimble full of ice cream, this is your place. They have a terrific selection of flavors, and you can sample as many as you want before choosing, not to mention they are part of a coffee shop too. Unfortunately, they charge you a thousand dollars for a scoop of it. I'd rather go to Mary Coyle and get a Banana Split for that price, or just save my money because the idea of paying $6 for a scoop of ice cream is absolutely a fool parting with his money.  Two stars because it actually was tasty.

Went here this past Saturday with my family for lunch.  The place is extremely chi-chi, if not the most chi-chi restaurant in central phoenix. I felt really out of place, but my mom had to go there as she swore by their chicken sandwich and hummus. I ordered the eggs benedict as it is always one of my favorite dishes. The Hummus was mediocre at best... AT BEST. Try Fattoush if you want real good hummus. The eggs benedict was some chi-chi take on the dish. It was crispy hard bread, how the hell do you expect me to cut that? I cut it and it crumbles into pieces... now explain how that is good. The cheese was half melted and to my knowledge there is not cheese on eggs benedict. The SLAUGHTERED that dish. The service we had at our table was very good, as the girl had only our table. I noticed at other tables, some of the servers were over the top sappy. I have to disagree with every other reviewer, this place is a culinary joke.

Bobby's, the Mancuso Restaurant is no longer a Mancuso Restaurant. They sold the one at the summit, so it is now just Bobby's.  My first time in the restaurant was last night. We didn't even know where to find the place. It was an eventful night to say the least. We arrived and realized my buddy still had his gun on his hip so went back to the truck to put that in the glove box (can't carry in a place that serves alcohol. We got back to the truck I'd owned for one hour, and realized I'd locked myself out of it. Once the AAA guy came we were good to go.  Back into the restaurant, it was dead downstairs at 8:30 so we went up to the lounge where they had a live piano/vocalist that was very entertaining. Beautiful bar upstairs which is very dark in colors and lighting. Downstairs is all white, with a little more lighting, and would be a nice place to take a second or third date or celebrate a somewhat special occasion. The restaurant really feels like two places in one. A trendy, fun, bar atmosphere that can cater to the more sophisticated younger crowds or the older crowds. Then the dining room feels very upscale, chic, New York City trendy but not-too trendy.  Our dinner we both agreed was great. Started off with the calamari fritti (11) which came with a tomato wine sauce that I thought was less than stellar, but the calamari was delicious by itself thankfully. The other app we tried was the stuffed mushrooms (10) which came in a dish of 6. They were well stuffed with sausage, garlic, cheese, and covered with alfredo sauce. It was a great dish that we both enjoyed. We had Veal Oscar and Veal Saltimbocca (27/29) for our entrees. I tried both and really preferred my Saltimbocca which was wrapped in prosciutto with ricotta cheese and a great cream sauce. The Veal was not really tender, and seemed as though it had been cooked a little on the long side. I like my abused baby cow to be tender as it gets.   The service here is perfect to a T. The gentleman who was our waiter upstairs never missed a beat and all of our food came out very quickly. One thing that he did reveal to us is they offer one free refill on soft drinks, and then charge again. He didn't charge me for my 5 iced teas, but said normally they do. That is kind of cheap.  Dinner for two with no alcohol - $82 + tip - not too bad for a place like this. I'll definitely do it again.

This place is a hidden gem. Have been passing it for years and finally went a couple of times and was very very pleased. It's extremely clean, the service is mom and pop very friendly, and the food is tasty.   I've tried the hot and sour soup which is tremendous, kung pao chicken which is fantastic, crab puffs which are great, and the create your own stir fry is fun and you can make it as healthy or fattening as you want.

Promised myself after my last visit that I shall never return. That was 2.5 years ago and I haven't been back since!  Went in and sat down in a booth, had dinner, ordered some drinks. We had been there about an hour (dinner + 2 rounds) when our server came over and said, we need to give her a credit card because our tab was over $50 and we were sitting close enough to the door we could walk out on it. I looked her square in the eye and asked if she thought maybe there might be a better way to word that, like "I'm sorry guys, I forgot to take a card to start your tab, do you think you could provide one?" She got very defensive and started telling me how people walk out on tabs by the door, so again, why didn't you just get one to start with instead of coming to our table in a combative manner. The bar is actually pretty cool, but that little bitch sealed the deal that I will never return, nor will I recommend it to any of my friends. EVER.  We paid the tab, left a $20 tip on a $50 bill, and left.

Love this place. I typically do the Pork Enchiladas with Green Tomatillo sauce, but everything on the menu is delicious. This is one of the only authentic Mexican restaurants in town, others being Barrio, La Hacienda, and Los Reyes. If you like the american style, with the rice and beans, chimichangas, etc. stay away, because you will not find that garbage here. The food is light and central american kinda style. The bar is a fun place on the weekends when they have a live salsa-merengue band that comes on at 8 or 830 and turns into more of a festive bar atmosphere. I've never been sick after eating here, and have always recieved good service. They are also excellent for groups. I like to book the back room, which holds at least 20 people and is almost like a semi-private room.

Ate at this restaurant Saturday november 14 and had my leftovers on Sunday november 15. Tuesday morning I woke up violently ill and could not hold in food or fluids all day tuesday.   Went to the urgent care tuesday evening and they promptly sent me to the ER to be treated for severe dehydration caused by "probably a food borne bacteria." I just finished my three day antibiotic course and am feeling much better, but now that I have had time to look at the facts and speak with the Maricopa County Department of Health, I can confidently say that my horrific three days of food poisoning were undoubtedly caused by YC's Mongolian Grill.  The fact that I was told someone else got a case of E.Coli with bloody stools just about a week before my poisoning really shored it up for me. YC's is apparently serving tainted or contaminated food. I would not recommend eating at this establishment. I must also make it clear that my noodles which I took home were transported from the restaurant to my refrigerator (20 minutes) and kept in the refrigerator until they were microwaved and consumed.

This place is a freakin' joke from the beginning. Let me preface this review by saying we had a group of 5, and 4 of us had 2 drinks before our 5th got her mojito. It seemed as if the bartenders were capable of doing a beer or margarita, but nothing even remotely complex (not that mojitos are really complex.) The food was absurd, and a joke to call it "mexican." I was sick all night, as were two of the girls in the group, and one guy. The service in the restaurant portion was the exact opposite of the bar, and was very precise, even though they were bringing out sizzling hot plates of death.   It's a fun place to go and have a drink before or after your dinner which hopefully is taking place elsewhere in Old Town. It's also a fun atmosphere on Tuesday nights, when you see all walks of life. I think if they changed the name to crappy taco, so as to lower my expectations, I might like the restaurant quite a bit.

After a fairly miserable first experience at Little Saigon, I was hesitant to go back, but because I know so many people who hold it in such high regard, I've been back several times. It grows on me a little bit every time and I realized that ever since I haven't seen the bad server I had the first time, I've really liked it!  They do fantastic spring rolls, with a tasty peanut sauce and the presentation is much nicer than usual. Bun Cha and Pho Tai are two dishes I've had there multiple times and was really impressed. Cold, fresh veggies, quality ingredients, and great taste.   This is a family run business and it really shows with the pride they take in getting to know their customers, and efficient friendly service. The restaurant, being in a home, has a certain charm that I'm used to downtown and really appreciate. This isn't my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town, but it's up there with the best. I wish their prices weren't so high. They are at least a dollar more per item than anyone else.

I'd been wanting to try Ticoz since it opened. There was so much buzz surrounding it for a couple months after it opened, and some of my gay friends still rave about it. So I finally tried it on Saturday for lunch and was a little dissapointed.  First off, I don't care if you are gay. That is absolutely your choice and I respect you making choices for yourself, but please for the love of god hire ONE person that still talks like he has a pair of testicles. Every waiter, bartender, and host that we encountered was almost inaudible and spoke in such a high tone of voice that I actually thought I was speaking to women.  Secondly, being the only table in the bar (+1 table in the patio area) should mean that we get decent service. Watching 4 staff members stand in a close proximity circle behind the bar talking about how much they drank last night and forgetting to bring us more drinks, a bill, my credit card back after I paid the bill, etc. is a little disconcerting. Perhaps even more disconcerting than my lack of ability to spell or my run on sentences.   Finally, when I tell you that I think your Pork Chile Verde dish has an almost inedible salt content, and you reply back to me "I've been telling them that for a long time and they wont change it," it's obvious that something is going wrong in your lines of communication. You wouldn't tell me that if a) you didn't also feel that way or b) you've heard other customers say the same thing. Regardless, what you should have said is "well I appreciate the feedback sir, may I offer you another dish with a lower salt content? and I'll be sure to let the chef know what you thought as well."  The atmosphere was cool, but not nearly up to Fez or Switch levels. It's obvoius that I am in the minority, but this restaurant really didn't score many points in my book.

Why is everyone hating on Stoudemire's so much? I've lived downtown for about 4 years now and had never been until last night. We went in to watch the Suns game and once the game started the place cleared out and we had it to ourselves. I was actually surprised it is a pretty nice place, and definitely expected more of a low key atmosphere like Majerle's, but it is pretty fancy.   They have two bars, which give a distinctly different vibe. The indoor bar feels very club like, while the outdoor bar feels a little more neighborhoody and casual. The outdoor bar is a great place to watch sports on TV. The servers and bartenders I encountered were definitely nice people and very accommodating. I gotta lose 15 lbs so I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and thought it was very good, and a decent size to make a meal for a guy. Their chefs BTW, for the entire Bill Smith empire, a restaurant Stoudemire's is a part of, are Michael Cairns and Matt Alleshouse, who came from the Arizona Biltmore as Executive Chef and Wright's Chef de Cuisine respectively. That would probably account for the ever improving food.   I probably won't be screaming to return to the place though for a couple of reasons. One; the cost. Salad and 3 gin and tonics = $48!!!  Like I said, it was a great salad, but woo for them for being able to get such a great profit margin. Reason two is there is nothing to really set this place apart from other sports bars in the area that offer more unique settings like Majerle's, Alice Cooperstown, or even Friday's for that matter.  +1 for pretty good food +1 for good service -1 for cost.

Yo, this is my favorite AJ's here. If you gots a beef with the prices then go somewhere else. Actually, the prices aren't any higher than Safeway, they just carry better, and more expensive for them to buy, products.   They have been great to me as far as ordering Rambutans when I have a whim or a craving. The sandwich counter is awesome, and I love the slices of pizza that are as big as my head. The drink counter is stellar and they brew China Mist iced teas. Every once in a while the Prickly Pear flavor comes up and I'm so so so happy.   This store is much larger than the Scottsdale/Lincoln location, and the service here is friendlier than that location as well. Shot out to Gerri at the floral counter, she is teriffic, as well as the produce manager who takes care of me every time. You guys rock!

Fist off, any bar in a basement is cool.  Secondly, a place where a ton of drunk asses are singing tunes to banging pianos is ok with me. They don't seem to charge a cover on the weekdays, and the drinks are pretty cheap. I love Monday Miller Lite night for $2 per bottle.   They don't seem to ever get stumped, and I have come up with some pretty creative songs for them. The other night they played some shit that I've never even heard.  Everyone here is cool, and the place does infact get pretty busy. Go early and grab a seat by the stage and don't let go of it.

I love Dicks.  Uhhhh  By this point, I've probably had everything on the menu twice over. There are so many dishes that are both varied to please everyone, and still consistent with what they are going for which is the New Mexican Cuisine.   Dick's has it all, a quaint and unique atmosphere. It feels like a small eatery you'd find in a downtown of a big city, it's a really fun, dark, kind of sexy place to take a date too. There aren't many better first date locales.  The Pork Chop Chorizo, Roasted Garlic Plate, Red White and Blue Enchiladas, and of course the Carne Adovada are some of the real standouts for me. They serve Chimay on draft, the servers are friendly, and it's got the fun great atmosphere to boot. You owe it to yourself to try it.  I just hate telling people I had Dicks for dinner.

I've been here several times and have never had a great experience, but never a bad one either. My last trip turned it into a "very poor" rating.   The food is only sub par and the service is average. My last visit had me really put off while I listened to a half dozen or so staff members have conversations about their "stupid ass hole boss" and one bartender actually told a colleague that she wished her boss would die. I don't care what your opinion of your boss is, but I don't want to listen to your drama while I eat. I was really tempted to write the management about this but then I thought I'd just quit going here because really it kind of sucks.

I can't believe I never took the time to go here before. This place is so close to being the perfect relaxation spot.   I was pleasantly surprised that it's so quiet here. You really feel as though you've left the city for the time that you are in the garden. The waterfalls, the koi, and the plants are all very unique to the area and provide perfect relaxation opportuinties.  However, it's quite sad that they have let the grass all go dormant. There is one area where they overseeded rye grass and it looks great, unfortunately, every place else is brown.  :(

After dinner and a drink at the restaurant in the hotel (see my review for Gallo Blanco) we took a stroll around the pool, lobby, and rooftop bar area. I noticed a few things I really liked, and MANY that would keep me from ever recommending someone to stay here.   1. The pool area has obviously had some thought go into decorating, and they pay respect to the city with a giant Phoenix bird sculpture, awesome!  2. They have art all over from different parts of Arizona, as well as Arizona license plates on the rooms and directional signs. I love the sense of pride for where we are from.  That's about all the good qualities we could find. . . the bad....:  1. The windows on the outside of a building are those from a disgusting slum of an apartment building. It's obvious you took a shortcut and couldn't spend the money to finish the remodel.  2. You have disgusting stairs, carpets, and rails on all the outdoor common areas. Again, did you want to finish this remodel?  3. The hallways we walked through at the end of the building smelled like puke, and had worn out carpet along with thick coats of paint that appeared to be centimeters thick. Did you strip the walls before you started the remodel? The smell of vomit went away as soon as the smell of marijuana from someones room took over.  4. Your elevator buttons don't light up, and the elevator is scary with stained carpet. I felt like I was picking up an STD just standing in it.  This place feels like a Daytona Beach spring break hotel from the 90's or perhaps one of the trendier hotels in Rocky Point. It feels like a third world attempt to be upscale, and it's obvious that someone wanted to half-ass their way through a remodel. Not to mention the fact that I've watched the owner go on various chat boards and forums across the internet only to talk shit about every property in town that is worlds nicer than his. I hope that anyone who stays here is used to Motel 6, enjoys watching people making out in halls, and likes thumping techno, because that is the only way they will be impressed.   This place is like third world spring break 24/7, and I'm pretty sure the "bar" on their rooftop is actually a folding Costco card table.

Phoenix PD is the shit.  I've had the rare opportunity to watch someone get tackled, fight a cop, and then get the shit tazed out of him. I'll never forget watching a 6 foot something 300+ pound black guy dropping to the ground like a sack of bricks. and then shaking and convulsing.   Rule #1 don't rob circle K and then try to get away from cops with helicopters and dogs. They will get you.

Matt Poole, you failed miserably... if you were trying to make a crappy bar. The Roosevelt is a historic preservationist's dream, as the home it is in has been beautifully remodeled, even if it does feel like a frat party the way it is set up. I love the keg room with the glass wall making everything visible, it's very cool. I like the beer list, but the wine list and food menu leave a little to be desired. I'm a little confused why slim jim's (sun devil stix) are on the menu, as well as a grilled cheese and tomato soup... ok I like grilled cheese and soup, but not really at a bar. That doesn't exactly say upscale bar food, that says more like I'm naked on the couch watching Fast Times at Ridgemont High and I've got the munchies whats in the kitchen? In all, I gotta give it a 4 because the place is so well remodeled and they did such a good job of keeping the original parts of the home well preserved... along with the stellar beer list, just the food menu makes me scratch my head.

It's like Subway for pizza! I loved all the choices, even as overwhelming as they were and making your own pizza is a cool idea. The place was extremely crowded on a Friday at lunchtime and we had to wait for a table, but only for a couple of minutes. Perhaps a hostess would be nice to make sure that one jackass by himself doesn't occupy a table for 4 and screw everything up. The price was pretty fair, with a pizza and drink being under $10. The dough though, was garbage and tasted like a 2 year old digiorno (ask me how I know that taste) but with the right ingredients and spices you can cover it up pretty easily. I want to go back, and when I do I will make sure it is not peak lunch hour, as it was just way too packed.

Everytime I drive by Loco Patron, it looks packed.  Not when I went! Damn!  We were literally the only ones in the bar, at 1330 on a Wednesday that wasn't too surprising though. The music is rather not good (they played madonna) and the place is just kind of .... there. I had an indifferent 3 star experience until I had a little run in with the bartender. I took a sip of my bottled beer and it was room temp. I called him over and asked if I could have the bill for our warm beers. He offered to "get something else that might be colder" and I declined. He then said if you don't want something else then why bitch about it dude? Whatever, I was trying to show my girl a good time for her 21st and didn't want to get in a big argument so I let it go.   Mark my words, I'll never go back. That was some serious attitude that was unnessecary.

16th Street Sports Bar is a funny place. It's kind of like high school all over again in the sense that I went to Washington, had a lot of friends at Sunnyslope, and a lot of them come here. With do reason too, as it is more of an entertainment spot than a sports bar. The TVs are somewhat limited in comparison to other places nearby, but they have shuffleboard, darts, pool, video games, etc.  The servers are all friendly, they have a great burger and beer of the month special that changes each month, and the food is better than average. Their prices are very fair as well.

1. They offer Rogue on draft. 2. They have umpteen billion different pasties. 3. It's not in North Phoenix or Glendale (read my reviews of places in those locations) so you are almost guaranteed to not dine next to redneck, lifted truck, white trash. 4. Service is really friendly. 5. Great soundtrack.  I wholeheartedly recommend it. I can't say anything that hasn't been said already so I'll leave it to that.

Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didn't like. I've had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didn't like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence.   Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume.   There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didn't have any customers at lunch time, I'm assuming the place is going to lose money today. Don't know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail.

I used to frequent the Lost Leaf almost daily starting the day they opened, unfortunately I cannot say the same anymore. I used to love the refrigerator full of beers, the music, and the cool little home, not to mention the biggest thing, the promise of a full bar. Now, everytime I go there it's full of douchebags, they are out of the beer I want, and the music has somehow become sucky. Perhaps the biggest kicker... there is still no full bar! The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality. And I swear if I see one more dude with girls jeans trying to look cool with a bomber of the worst beer imaginable I'm gonna snap.  Thanks for ruining what could have been an awesome hang out spot guys.

In a city with so many steakhouses to choose from, Kincaid's only makes itself look like another of the same both on the outside and inside. The menu is strikingly similar to the offerings you find at Morton's, Capital Grille, and other chain steakhouses in the Valley.  I used to love this restaurant while growing up, but I think it was the infatuation with the city and all its big building, one way streets, activity everywhere, etc. Now that I live in the city, and that luster has worn off, Kincaid's joins the ranks as "just another place to eat red meat." My last visit, I noticed the staff is about a half generation younger than its competitors, which is not really a problem, but may say something about employee turnover, quality of employment, etc. They are all nice, conversive, and helpful, albeit a little less knowledgable and professional.   The food quality has been all over the board for me, along with preperations. On one visit, I swore up and down I had one of the most tender and well cooked filets I had ever ordered. Another visit I ordered 3 ahi tuna tostadas, which were beautifully displayed, but had a mushy goo of a tuna on top of them. It was hardly a satisfying dish.  As for downtown options, I would say this is the best for those who are going an event, but it would definitely be worth a 10 minute drive/train ride to go to Durant's in Midtown. You'll have a more consistent, and less corporate experience for sure.

I've always loved the Ho. It's the epitome of hip.   Their rooms are scattered around a rather large sized parcel and are all extremely comfortable and designed in very urban chic furniture. The bathrooms are super cool with blue mood lighting and sliding frosted glass doors. They have a restaurant in the lobby which I've never tried, but it looks like pretty standard American fare. The beds are very comfortable, and they feature all new LCD tvs with iPod plug ins.

Holy crap this food is bad.   I'll not give it one star because the people are friendly, the menu is inexpensive, and they serve combonation plates during dinner times. Most of the time it is hard for me to get Chinese because everything is a la carte after lunchtime, and when you are dining alone, that sucks.   They close at 8PM nightly, and don't have much foot traffic after about 4pm. The food sucks and it seems like everyone knows it.

So I was on the first train, at 10 AM on Saturday, Dec. 27th. I have ridden the train every day since, mostly to Tempe and back, but a couple times westbound. I've ridden it to do grocery shopping, go to dinner, go drinking, celebrate my birthday, hell just about everything. My truck has been driven once since the first day of service, and I've ridden my motorcycle maybe 4 times.... its been 9 days folks.   This thing changed my daily routine for the better. I understand I could have done the same thing with a bus, but the bus only ran every 30 minutes and took forever and was uncomfortable and was so small if there was a smelly bum you couldn't get away from him. The train has changed it all for me.   What's keeping it from 5 stars? The same thing that everyone else is complaining about, the running hours. I'd love to not have to leave the bars at 10:40 to get a ride home. It's also very inefficient running through the city. I can get from the 12th street station to Mill Avenue in 16 minutes which is about 11 miles. In the meantime, it takes about 23 minutes to get to Camelback, which is half the distance. Also, I do feel very insecure at the Eastlake platforms at night time. I wish they could do something to at least give you the illusion that you are safe.

Wanted to like this place.... really really wanted to.   Horrible service, I mean absolutely horrible.   I arrived and was starting to say what a friend recommended to me but I couldn't remember the name of it and the guy behind the counter snapped and cut me off and said "I hear that ten times a day." Well buddy since you've heard it before, I can understand that working in the service industry, you'd not expect to hear it again (sarcasm.) Whatever, I made my order and was told to go relax at a table. Well, I relaxed for 18 minutes with no food (turkey BLT I ordered) and watched everyone else get their food. I got up and asked if I was forgotten and there was absolutely no apology offered, but said they would bring it to me.   When the guy brought over my sandwich, he kind of slammed it down on the table and walked away. No apology still, no offer to refund my meal, no come back later and try us again. They were just extremely rude about it. I understand, it happens... It's part of life, but they acted as if me not getting my food was a bother to them.  Horrible customer service. I'll tell everyone I know about this story. Nobody should be able to treat their customers like that. A simple "I'm sorry, come back and see us again for a free coffee" or something to that effect would have gone a loooooong way.   Too stupid to get it probably. Or maybe because I didn't have a rat-tail with a mohawk, a basketball jersey, converse shoes, and an obvious roid rage attitude, they just didn't care.

This was a great experience, and it's funny how it happened.   A friend of mine bought some things there like a seat bag with a repair kit, multi tool, etc. and then returned it the next day after deciding not to purchase a road bike as he had intended to. He reported some attitude from them, and then later that week I'd heard some other stories. So, I wanted to go in and look at their bikes as I was in the market for a new road cycle, and judge for myself what the service was like. I found Mark to be very helpful on my first visit even after telling him I wasn't purchasing a bike any time soon.  When I did decide I wanted to buy a bike, I went in and rode just about every Ultegra bike in the shop. Before and after each test ride, they cleaned off the whole bike, put my pedals on, provided feedback and dialed in the seat and everything for me. Other shops, even "high end" shops, will just guesstimate the setup of the bike, and often are reluctant to put on your own pedals and instead just want to use test ride platforms. I left a deposit on the BMC I chose, that was equal to about 7% just because it was all I had at the time. They were cool with that, and then excercised patience while I was rounding up the money to pay it off.   When I finally came in to pick up the bike, they had everything set up for me and even fitted the bike for me and gave me some free swag. The biggest thing is the owner, Kale, said "thank you for giving us your business." I know it seems trivial, but most places will just say thanks, and it is kind of empty. He made it seem sincere, like I was really important, and they really appreciated me spending my hard earned cash there. I also exchanged a couple of emails and asked a couple of questions to Brock and Russ, who both were prompt, informative, and friendly. If you have a question about your body mechanics on a bike or how it should be set up, Craig is a guru. He even forgot he took out my insole and forgot to put it back in, and then called me and acted as though he was ready to bring it to me. I must say, the stories I heard about the poor service are bunk. My friends must all be doing the same drug, or they get nervous when they walk into a shop with this much worth of inventory.  This shop is clean as a whistle, well stocked, organized, and the staff is extremely knowlegable and friendly. I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing a Huffy in here for service, but for anyone who is a semi-serious to a racing cyclist, this is a dream shop.

I don't believe this restaurant has a buffet for dinner any longer. Tucked into the most Asian intersection in Phoenix, Phoenix Palace is a gigantic open space of a dining room and looks like a very authentic place. There are always tables of Chinese men drinking coffee and catching up on weekend nights. On Friday and Saturday nights, you'll be able to catch Chinese karaoke night from about 10PM on.   They serve fantastic food. Nothing here (at least on the menu they give us whiteys) is really out of the norm from your normal Chinese place. They have a couple of dishes I'm not accustom to, but mostly is the familiar Kung Pao, Beef & Broccoli, Hot and Sour Soup, etc.  The food here was delicious, service was perfect, and the atmosphere was truly one of a kind for Phoenix. If you'd have asked me a month ago where you could go for Chinese karaoke, I'd have said San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York City. Well, now I know, and my life is complete.   I wouldn't hesitate to go back here for more meals. The food is incredbly tasty and fresh.

Great place to purchase kitchen gadgets. They have EVERYTHING here. Things I can't find at Ikea, Cost Plus, Target, etc. can always turn up at Sur La Table. There is a myth that things here are overpriced, and that is bunk. If you compare the same item at SLT and say Target, they will be about the same, thing is SLT really only carries high end products, whereas at other places you can pay a lower price by purchasing off-brand crap.  Great selection of Shun knives (they have other brands too but I'm partial to Shun.)

I love the goofy chicago shit on the walls, and the haphazard menus that dont make any sense all over the walls. It is the first place where I actually felt like it could belong in Chicago. The guy that owned it was obviously from a big city back east, just by looking at him and talking.   The food though? Not so good al.

This is one of my favorite bars in Tempe, or rather, it's my favorite bar near Mill Avenue. The food here is tasty, the service has always been friendly, even the bouncers that garner so many complaints. The only people complaining about the bouncers are drunken frat boy types who can't hold their liquor and become beligerent.   I've never been here on peak times, always on weekday nights or early on the weekends. Everyone I've taken there has had a great time, and they constantly do great food and drink specials. I perticularly love their Taco Tuesday, where you can select any taco for $2 and get $2 mexican beers. Much tastier and larger portions than Cien Agaves.

Yes, Performance Bike is a chain, and generally I'll go to any length to support my local bike shop, but sometimes you have to do what your wallet tells you to do. I don't think anyone in town can beat PB's pricing. I was surprised when I first went in here how big this place is and how much inventory they keep. It's staggering really. I actually had to make two visits before I made a purchase, and two different salesmen helped me. Both were great, and it's nice they aren't on commission because they seem like they really want to get you into the right bike for you. Cool!  So I'm a very experienced mountain biker, but I wanted to get a road bike and I didn't want some cheap ass big box bike with awful components. My mountain bike is built as a Cross Country race bike so it's probably faster on pavement than a cheap road bike anyway. I didn't know crap about road bikes when I went in here, and these guys were very patient and explained everything to me from the beginning up. I ended up purchasing a leftover '09 Fuji Roubaix from a sales guy named Matt. He was so cool... helped me stuff the bike into a BMW 3 series coupe (hard btw) and helped me do a lot of extra stuff.   The service here is great. They don't do a lot of really really high end stuff, but they do sell Fuji, GT, and their house brand Scattante. Those manufacturers do make high end bikes, but they aren't the most amazing fantastic top of the line machines.   I love their service, their low prices, and the fact that I got a $1,500 bike for $899... woo.

This restaurant is far and away the best steakhouse in Arizona. I frequent Morton's, City Hall, Ruth's Chris, and Capital Grille, and Donovan's beats them all hands down. They actually include the vegetable and starch with the meat, rather than charging $15 each. They even have a complimentary service that picks you up and takes you to the restaurant, which is very useful if you want to enjoy the wine list. The service can be over-bearing at times, but always helpful, and they have 3 servers per table. I like the rib chop, which is basically a ribeye... extremely flavorful. Last time I was in, the 3 of us ran up a $950 ticket, so it can be very expensive, but if you can afford it I highly recommend it.

great selection of farm raised game along with their cow, chicken, pig, etc. Prices are decent here and the service is great. I'm not sure how much I can say about a butcher. Good service, fair prices, and vast selection says it all.

Barry Schoenman is perhaps the friendliest (and the most talkative) shopkeeper in this city. These places are few and far between in Phoenix and the more we can support them the better.   I've been shopping at this store for years ever since I started wearing a suit to work back in 2003. Infact, I am wearing a suit right now that I purchased from Barry in 2007 that still wears like new. It was $200!  He is a nice guy, has great prices, and can special order anything. It's no wonder he has such a loyal customer base.

This is more of a rant than a review, so bear with me.  Scenario: I'm standing in front of Circle K on 9th Street and Van Buren, which is not making me happy to begin with and my new car won't start. MINI roadside service says all they can do is tow me home, which isn't gonna help, so I call AAA. They told me an hour to get someone out there. Ok, my cars alarm is going off, the door locks and key fob wont operate, and I'm basically pissing everyone at Circle K off. Some nice hispanic guy helps me to try to jump it, and it wouldn't work. 6 bums, 1 sunburn, and 3 grape powerades later I decide to push it home which is only 4 blocks.   After pushing the car home, on my own, and parking it outside of my building, I go inside and call AAA. It is now 4:50 and they tell me someone will be here between now and 7:20.... ok 7:20 is a long way away, and my car alarm is still going off, then stops, then goes off again... intermittently I'm sure making my neighbors pissy. My home AC is on the fritz so I'm basically in a home 83 degrees with a fan blowing on me, a storm approaching, and no more grape powerade. I'm PISSED at this point.   6:30 rolls around and I decide to start drinking vodka to pass the time...  7PM I'm drunk...  7:30 I'm drunk outside by my car cursing the fact that nobody has come yet.  7:45 go back for another drink inside... Finally get a phone call from the driver saying he is parked next to a cute blue MINI. 8:15 I'm paying $145 for a new battery to some dude who keeps talking about himself.   8:30 Car is parked safely at home but I am 1. Drunk 2. Pissed that I had to wait so long 3. Pissed that it cost so much 4. Pissed that the guy wouldn't shut up about himself. 5. pissed that my AC isn't working. 6. PISSED that he called my car "cute"  To sum it up, I hate dead batteries, and the company that fixes them. If I hadn't at least pushed a 2100 lb car down the street, I'd have been waiting in front of Circle K for 3 hours. FUCK THAT.

This restaurant exemplifies how to make a customer for life. I was working late on Valentine's Day and my girlfriend was at Montelucia babysitting for a tourist, so I figured I'd take the opportunity to saddle up at a bar somewhere and get a quick bite to eat.   Houston's had a set menu and was full, Oregano's was packed to the gills and offered a small menu as well, then on to SunUp, who had a limited menu as well. By this point, I was ready to pop... I just wanted a bite to eat, but I didn't want to settle for Subway again. From the moment I arrived at St. Francis, I felt 100% welcome. I asked the valet where I could self park, he said right up front I could take any place I wanted. The hostess, when asked if I could eat at the bar, said I could make myself right at home. They were all so nice.   I saddled up to the bar and was immediately given a "couple's" menu featuring a rather steeply priced dinner for two. I got out of my seat and before I left I asked the bartender if she happened to know of a place in the area which wouldn't be on a set menu (who knows, she might have a friend in the industry that told her where they work wasn't doing anything special.) She snarked back that they were offering the couple's menu and that was it. Perhaps she was upset she was working V-day, but she was the only unhappy person I encountered. Her bar-back was on the ball and went to get the manager, who immediately offered to get me a burger and fries! Awesome!  The French Onion Burger was fantastic. It was a very high quality and inventive way to serve a hamburger, and was sided by some great french fries and a spicy ketchup that I found to be delicious. $20 for a burger and a beer was a little more than I would expect to pay normally, but this is a VERY nice restaurant so I quickly got over it.  Overall, this is a neat spot anyway, but the overly accommodating attitude of the staff made it an easy five-star review in my book. I can only hope they are like this all the time, and if they are, they will succeed for a long time to come.

Love me some Boba Tea House. The girls working here are always nice and full of energy and the selection of teas is incredible. I always get the Almond Milk Tea with Boba and it's a great rush of sugar if you don't feel like downing a stomach sized cup of Starbucks to get your rush.   It's not that expensive compared to a lot of Boba places around town, and the taste is great.

I'm almost ashamed to say that I order pizza here, but I do. It's either this, Domino's (hate) or Papa John's (almost too good if you're hammered drunk.) The pizza always takes forever, and sometimes arrives cold. Last night I ordered wings from their Wing Street and they were actually edible, but the little dumbass delivery guy named Pedro didn't say a word the entire time he was standing at my door. I have to assume you know how to speak, as I'm sure even Pizza Hut has that requirement. Maybe he got lost in the bird poo forest on the way to my house and was scared off by the hazardous waste sign at my front door, or the fact that I answered the door with a gun on my hip. Either way dude, speak damnit!!!!  But Pizza Hut, you'll be hearing from me next time I overdo the vodka and Grape Powerade drinks, and I'll still complain the next day.

Ok we had a run in with this place today. My buddy loves it and swears it is the best pizza around. I'd had it once and thought it was ok at best, definitely not the best in town like new times says.   Tried to order today for football... they do not deliver until 3 on sundays?! WTF! They HAVE to be Mormons, with the limited Sunday hours. We ended up getting Domino's yuck.

Used to love this place, and still think very highly of the food, but the recent emergence of awful attitudes from the owners and staff has put them in the back seat. Make no mistake, it is the best sushi in town, and Koji-San is the best chef, but everything else about it stinks. The wait staff is surly, and nobody could care less if you were actually in the restaurant. It is a BYOB, which I kind of like, but only if I can stop by AJ's and get a nice bottle of Sake or Shochu before hand. I recommend the ahi as it is always super fresh, and the mackerel is served in an extremely unique fashion. Nothing like looking something in the eye while you eat it.

Bar Smith has great sandwiches for lunch, and a nice rooftop bar open most evenings. Be warned, the place smells like a raw sewer burst open. Hang out for about 15 minutes, and your nose will get used to it and stop noticing. There really isn't anything special about the place, but everything is good. I always have had my eyes on the enormous bottles of grey goose above the bar.  UPDATE - 6-20-08:  Went in last friday to meet up with a friend. He had been there since 4:30 in the afternoon, and now it was 10pm so as you can imagine he was too drunk to really know his surroundings. I walked up and they were frisking everyone who went through the door, and took one look at me and said go ahead... lol. The girl tried to charge me a cover, which I denied and went ahead and went in anyway, as I was not planning on staying longer than what it took to get my buddy out of there. I went in and it was a friggin thug fest. Every Cholo, Ese, and Heina in Phoenix was there. I was the only white guy in the place. It felt very unsafe, even for a guy who grew up in the hood. I will never go back there as long as they are advertising to and accepting this type of clientele. It's unsafe, unsophisticated, and downright embarrasing.   ONE STAR!

This was, food wise, the best restaurant in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I say food wise because it is no longer in operation and is now a restaurant called Bistro Italiano. Totally different ownership/management.

I'm not too ashamed to admit that I actually *like* Pei Wei. Of course, this is also my favorite location due to the building they are in.   It's a historic adaptave reuse that they really did a great job with. The menu is great because they really offer crowd pleasing food (uninteresting) at pretty fair prices. I spend less on take out here than if I go to China Chili, and the portions are about the same. They also give me the option of having brown rice which is great.   Their mongolian beef I'm quite sure is filled with meth or crack or something. It's a very addicting flavor, and helps to make sure you get your years worth of sodium that day.

I have to agree with the reviewers here. This place is just not good.   We went there before a Suns game because every other place was packed. Steve's was empty and now I know why. I ordered their signature Green House Pasta, which was one of the blandest things I'd ever eaten. Our server was so scatterebrained and running all over the restaurant that he forgot part of my order and I still can't figure out why. He didn't appear to have any other tables.....???? He kept saying "be right with you guys" every time he left. Uhm, are you trying to tell us that You'll be back? or that you'll see us when you see us? I'm so confused... did you forget that you already helped us?  This restaurant solely survives on business from Hyatt and Wyndham guests that stumble outside and see the first place they can eat. I told our server that I thought my food was awful, and I ate it anyway because I didn't have time to wait for another item nor did I want to risk my food.   One thing I noticed is the menu says "we use fresh fish as often as possible." What the fuck? So what if you can't get fresh fish? you're going to serve me something less than that? How about "we only use the freshest fish." Or truly, do you sometimes serve unfresh fish?

Update: The gayest restaurant in Midtown just became my favorite restaurant in Midtown. I would say by now I've had maybe 10 meals here and every single visit has been exceptional from the quality and flavors of their food to the service, to the drinks.   Brunch is tremendous, and you can't be the $5 recession buster plate that I half expected to be a tiny meal, and then could barely finish it.   This is an awesome place.

I will never give this restaurant another dime as long as i live.   I have spent countless hours and dollars here as well as refered many family members and friends here. The food is great, but the recent visits have been inexcusable. Friday night the place was semi busy but had 3-5 empty tables and about 8 open seats at the bar. We asked for a table and were told it was a 45 minute wait so we opted to sit at the bar, but were told there was a wait there as well. I told the hostess there were empty seats all over and asked if we should go somewhere else. She told me very annoyed that we could sit at the bar. Through out whole meal nobody else sat at the bar. I wonder who was waiting.   Today i just returned for sunday brunch and was told there is a wait for a table, again plenty of seats open. So i said can i sit at the bar? She replied she was trying to keep those seats open "incase a large party comes in." i asked ok where can i sit prior to being told "just wait for a table." again i askes should i just go spend my money somewhere else? She then fumbled and said let me see what i can do. What can she do im thinking? What the hell there are open seats everywhere and nobody waiting and one of your best regulars wants ONE seat. Needless to say I walked right out.  In an economy where places are shutting down and losing their lease, id think you would hire nice and intelligent people. There are lots of over qualified people who need any job they can get. I dont know why i would spend my money somewhere where people are rude to me and incompetent.   You lose, switch.

Being a huge fan of Chicago, and the cuisine it creates, I'm always on the prowl for a good Chicago style pizza or hot dog. I stumbled into Johnny's one day on accident after being disgusted by Z Pizza and I'm glad I did. They do the single best reproduction of the true Chicago hot dog I've had in Phoenix. Perfect bun, dog, relish, onions, sport peppers, celery salt, tomato, and pickles. There is no ketchup to be seen, which scored some big points in my book, until I looked around the corner and saw it was served but with french fries... I guess I can let it slide. Johnny is a nice guy and serves great dogs. Can't beleive nobody has reviewed this place yet...

Great place to mingle with more sophisticated people than who you'd usually find in the area.   Jade bar does a great job with interesting cocktails and I've tried some things here that are definitely outside the box and really liked. They make a drink called the Fiery Mandarin that is vodka, lemon juice, cranberry juice, jalapeno, and orange zest. I've been making it at home it's so good. Their bartender wins just about every award in the book for cocktails.  Great view on the patio, awesome happy hour, and an awesome vibe. I could go for some Shishito Peppers and a Fiery Mandarin right now. MMMM

oh glorious drunk alcoholic career making dive bar how I love you. I've never actually had a drink of alcohol at Yucca Tap Room... I'm too scared to. I've heard too many stories about people passing out, getting into fights, and having wacky adventures on the way home. I used to be all for these types of adventures but now I just like to hang out here and enjoy the atmosphere and drink soda until I explode.   The crowd can be pretty diverse I hear, but everytime I go there there are mostly "rockabilly" and "rude boys" filling the bar. I don't mind these types, but it gets a little weird when everyone is alike so much. This is a dive for twenty somethings which I love, because most bars like this attract career alcoholics, whereas this one attracts new alcoholics and alcholics in training. Thats way more fun.

New Years Eve, 930PM you'd think this place would be either closed or charging a premium. Nope, neither.   We enjoyed $1 Coors and a $20 all you can eat BBQ buffet for about an hour before heading on to the bars. What a deal! The food was excellent, and the place was a very fun atmosphere to hang out in. The larger lady that runs it was even cool enough to rag on my friend who was eating a polish sausage asking him if he eats a lot of wiener. LOL! She also brought out a game that gives each of the four players a trigger, and the last one to hit the trigger when the light turns green gets electricuted. That was pretty fun.  The place feels like a tailgate party from front to back. The TV's were playing south park, all the menus are on chalk boards, and its mostly a middle aged crowd there to drink beer and get rowdy. It's a fun place.

Stopped by here for lunch today, just kind of on a whim. I'd never been in the old Marvin's Garden diner, but it didnt seem like much could have changed. Hell, the booths even have signs saying you can't sit there as a single between 11-2, lol.  When I walked in the side door, a woman looked at me and held up one finger, so I nodded yes I'm alone. She put a menu down at the counter and had a bowl of celery soup and an egg roll before I got there. Pretty good start. I took a glance at the menu and ordered the cashew nut chicken and it came within 5 minutes. The place definitely seemed to have perfected the "quick lunch" concept. The service was flawless from start to finish, as well. Everything I had, including the usually bland celery soup was delicious. The cashew nut chicken being probably my favorite asian dish I've had in quite some time. It all seemed very light and on the healthy side as well.  I ended up with a bill of $7.33 which for the amount of food, and the quality of food, and the quality of service, I was very pleased with. They are doing a lot of things right here, and I think this will be a very successful restaurant in the Midtown dining scene. I only hope the best for them as it really is great.

Perfect example of a great restaurant that lives in a crappy place. From the outside one might be scared to go in... it's in Sunnyslope for cripes sake! The tortas, and aguas frescas are both incredible. They blow a lot of other "torta" restaurants I've been to out of the water. The atmosphere is pretty bare bones, but they have done a nice job of making it feel welcoming and festive. There are always lots of kids there and lots going on, so be ready for a non-relaxing meal, but a very delicious one at that. The portions are enormous, and most people would be able to split one sandwich. Just watch your back around the area.

Edit: You can't beat a good restaurant within walking distance of your home. You also can't beat the fact that this location doesn't have nearly the waits (if any) of it's southside counterpart. The food is excellent, the service is friendly, and it is spiffy clean. I love the green jalapeno/tomatillo salsa and the red chili burro enchilada style, but that is one spicy meal!  +1 for being close -1 for the firebomb it leaves in your stomach

Stelagtites.  I could make this review just that one word, but I'll explain my night a little more indepth to please the yelp gods. It started at exactly 11:01pm on Friday night, three of the whitest dudes around looking for trouble. After being told there was no cover until 11 (a couple minutes earlier and perhaps 9:58?) and one dollar drafts by the staff, and then waiting in line to get in until 11:01, they tried to charge us a cover. Wait a second, we were just told there wasn't one, and we were in line before 11PM but bouncer mcbouncy over there was doing 35 second ID checks presumably to take longer?  We ended up paying $12 for the three of us, such a negotiable price that I felt like I was in rocky point at the donkey show. Still though, $1 draft beers, thats all I was looking for. Finally getting into the place, it was dead, with maybe 15 people in there, but at least the bar was empty so we pulled up and ordered our beers. They came in the little dixie cups that the hospital gives you to take your meds with when you dont really want fluids. Ok so it was a little bigger than that, but it was an 8oz disposable plastic cup. I had 5 of them which is 40oz and cost me $5. That was approximately 3 regular beers and would have cost me $6 as bottles were $2 each so it was still kind of a deal.   We hung out in the back area mostly as they had some nice cushy chairs and the music was a little quieter. I also noticed the abundance obscenely overweight women didn't go back there much, maybe it took too much effort. It was our sanctuary.   Out of nowhere I looked up and saw stelagtites, what the fuck is that all about? They were cut into the ceiling, in lieu of 3 ceiling tiles. Mystified as I was, I was also drunk so I shrugged it off. But looking back, it really was a cheap ass place full of crappy attitudes and tackiness. Yet another bar for kids to shoot each other in.

Yay! Tiggo's, you capped off a night of watching the Suns game by actually running me out before it ended. I don't remember the last time I've not watched a game in its entirety. You make me want to watch at home because it is becoming apparent that downtown Phoenix sports bars are awful.  Please hire a bartender that knows what she is doing. You can put any cute, slightly over face painted girl behind the bar and have her get drinks and push buttons. It's just that some take a lot longer to do things. The bar was full to capacity and she was moving at the same speed I would move if mom asked me to take out the trash when I was 12. She had trouble opening bottles of coors light with a bottle opener, couldn't find the buttons she wanted on the POS screen, and generally wasn't good at her job.   Their saving grace from getting one star is they have $2.50 coors lights. Yeah yeah, I drink shitty beer. Eat one if you have a problem with that, lol. I finally had to leave because after two beers I had to pee so bad and their restroom was under standing liquid, not sure what kind, but I wasn't about to walk in it.

Driving up to San Tan Brewing, one might think they are in disneyland. A small, contrived downtown that feels more like an outdoor mall than anything else. I guess this is what "downtown" Chandler is all about.   San Tan Brewing Company has been hyped to me by a couple of people, but their Tuesday night Tasting really caught my eye after it was featured in the Phoenix New Times. My friends and I decided to go and luckily we were one of the first ones to reserve so we got right in. The event was a 6 course tasting menu, with 6 beers, for $25 and I kept thinking WOW! what a value. As the night progressed, I figured out how they were able to serve this menu for $25 and still muster a profit.   Our first course was actually their Sun Devil Cask Ale, which was a delicious beer for those who like a hoppy and bitter ale. I am a huge fan of Stone's Double Bastard, and Dogfish Head's 120 and 90 minute IPA so this was right up my alley. Our first food course was a spinach salad with chocolate chips, raspberries, and some sort of syrup, yuck! Second course that came out was a date stuffed with chorizo, wrapped in bacon, and it was absolutely delicious. I figured the evening was going to be saved...  When our third course came out, I started getting worried again as it was a buffalo chili with what was supposed to be cornbread in it. I was pretty sure it was a biscuit that came out of a tube... yeah, it was that pathetic. The beer they paired it with, however, I fell in love with. The smoked porter was amazing, to me as I love very peaty scotches.   So the guy came on the microphone and started explaining that the short rib main course was taking a while because they had been cooking for 14 hours and were falling apart when they were plated. Oh man, I'm really in for a treat now! He gave the story about how they had purchased these the night before from a great meat provider (I didn't know Lee Lee Market was known for high quality meats) and they had been slow cooking ever since. I got even more excited. What was put in front of me though, had to be the most insulting, pathetic excuse for a piece of meat I have seen in my life. I love short ribs like a fat kid loves cake, but I could only muster two bites of mine before finally giving up. Most of those around me were in agreement that it was a bad piece of meat, cooked poorly, and consisted of 75% gristle. I had the "pleasure" of sitting across the table from one of their employees who had the "pleasure" of annoying me all night. I told him exactly what I thought of the dish, and how he should be embarrassed to work at any place that would serve it to a human being. It was the WORST dish I've had in a long long time. Absolutely vile.   I have to say the servers were friendly, and the place had a cool vibe and a sweet patio, but the food is just unfathomably awful. I think they are getting by on the culinary ignorance of everyone in Chandler. Put this place downtown or in Scottsdale and they would really have to ramp things up. They did announce that their chef is leaving the restaurant, and maybe I should have kept my mouth shut, but I told them on my way out that they should be excited for the chance to get someone with talent.  end rant.

What a terrific experience from start to finish, minus like two things.  The atmosphere is very cool. A couple of things I really liked was the way they get ice at the bar. No cubes, just a block of ice and the bartender makes the cubes himself. Also, the "wine cellar" is beautiful, not unique but beautiful. Restrooms are awesome, and their private dining rooms are great with a huge 600 year old tree as a table. It is basically an entire tree, as explained by William, the manager. One thing that bothered me almost the whole meal was the lighting, which was very bright. Finally they turned it down at about 8:30 but it felt like a dining hall for a bit there.  Monday night apparently is not a busy night for them, as we were one of three tables, and nobody was at the bar or grill. The server we had was definitely very very good, and perfectly attentive, though as he explained the restaurant and specials he was extremely quiet. I had to ask him to repeat himself and he turned it up, for a second, then turned it back down. Whatever. William, the restaurant manager was awesome as well, making me feel like he was privileged to have me there. We decided to just put them in charge and see what we got with both food and sake.   The first course, Butterfish, was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies. Second course of Tempura Rock Shrimp was not my favorite, but good. It had a bit of a Mexican flavor with chile and lime. The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish, just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I did not care for the next which were the chicken skewers. The main course of Rib Eye was average, and I wanted more pork belly. All of the sakes served to us were great, and dessert was wonderful as well. Foodwise, this was a near perfect evening, with only one dish really being blah, and that was the ribeye.  I do hope they get busier soon, as they are going to be in trouble if last night was the norm. It was DEAD. For Phoenix, this is a truly unique dining option. Roka is a great option for dinner before going out to Old Town, or a great spot to get together with friends to celebrate.

This is a very neat place that is a great adaptave reuse of a firehouse. Sure it's in Sunnyslope, the butthole of Arizona, but it's in a perfectly fine part of Sunnyslope, and most of the people at this establishment are from better parts of town. It's the crowd that would typically go to Vig, Postino, etc. but are less concerned with being seen, so they go to Bombero.   They get HUGE points for serving Spanish Chorizo, which if you have never had is the real way to serve and eat chorizo. It's chopped and almost the same consistency as salame or pepperoni. They do a great menu of panini sandwiches and have a neat Southern American based wine menu.  The patio here is trememdous with huge fire pits, a treen canopy, and a great seating arrangement with couches and large chairs. The service here was good and the food was very tasty.

What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.  It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona.   The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it.   The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.

This place replaced Seamus Mcaffery's as my local watering hole. The atmosphere is fun, with darts and pool. They have a great patio to people watch or laugh at the folks waiting for a table at Pizzeria Bianco (or while you are waiting.) The food is very good, from the buffalo wings to the shepard's pie. Even their garden salad at $4 has fresh spinach, cherry tomatoes, and other obviously fresh products. Nothing appeared to be of cheap quality. Their beer selection is very large, and features a lot of local beers, plus hard to find european beers, with a full bar. I've gone here for all occasions, from night of hard drinking, to dinner with the family. It works for all occassions. They are extremely friendly and very accommodating (even allowed us to order Papa John's to their patio, since the kitchen was closed.) Great music, great food, and nice people. I really hope they are able to keep the low prices as well, and still turn a profit and make rent.  Tuesday night is $2 well night!  A+ establishment.

So my last review was quite favorable...  They took away the dart boards. They put TVs everywhere, like a sports bar. The service (minus the two regular girls) has gone to shit. Food has gone downhill. I remember saying how the food was high quality and good. Not so much anymore. Ownership is just not getting it. I've had lots of conversations with Chris because I DO NOT want the local pub to close down. The place has been a ghost town as of late, and there are reasons why.  1. don't take away stuff that people enjoy doing. You may think it isn't profitable, but when people come to the bar and find a game they like, then they stay longer. Thus they drink more beer.  2. don't close earlier than you say you are going to, and don't cut kitchen service off early. People remember that. The next time they are hungry or thirsty they will go elsewhere that they know is open.   3. Train your employees. They used to make regular rounds on the patio and to the tables. Nowadays you are so understaffed that if you don't walk to the bar, you ain't getting a drink.  4. GET SOME FUCKING COORS LIGHT! You have been out of it EVERY time I've been there in the past month (9-10 times) and that is ridiculous. I hope you guys are reading this. I really do. You're going to mess up a good thing.

These are the best bike tracks in the area. There are three tracks, an easy(sport loop,) moderate (long loop,) and difficult (tech loop.)   The sport loop by a good rider can be done in less than 20 minutes. It is FAST, and has a lot of fun turns. There are also some nice places to catch some air, and really build up some speed on downhill sections. This is by far the most entertaining trail I have ridden in the Phoenix area, and only Schultz Pass in Flagstaff is faster.  The long loop has some teriffic climb sections and some nice ledges to climb, as well as a couple of moderate to mild drops. it takes significantly more time, and as I remember is around 12-14 miles. It's a great workout if you do it twice around.   The tech loop is the most difficult with the ledge drop and a couple other obstacles. This is a good track to donate blood or break bones if you are not an experienced rider. I ride a hardtail Kona Kula Supreme and it kicks my butt. This is one of the more demanding trails in the Mcdowell Mountain area, and only National and Trail 1A are tougher in my opinion.  If you want to experience all 3 tracks, but aren't really inclined to do the tough obstacles on the tech loop, try starting out on the Sport, then merge onto the tech (this will bypass the obstacles) and then onto the long loop. Thats about a 16 mile track and is a lot of fun. I will go out in the winter and do that once, then do sport, then long again and its a very good workout.

I've been driving by Lucky Boy for almost a decade and never really found it a convenient place to stop. I'd always either just ate, or had to be somewhere quick, and had no time to stop.  A friend and I stopped in yesterday evening and it was like I'd made it somewhere after years of trying. The young girl behind the counter, and whom I'm assuming was her mother were both extremely welcoming and friendly. They asked if it was our first time, told us how to order, and were generally awesome. Service here is perfect.  The place is as you would expect, un-updated 50's inside. It's been there roughly 60 years. There is no music, and no real entertainment factor, so this might be a better place to hit the drive through, but the inside wasn't dirty, it was just boring.   They feature their 1/4 and 1/2 pound burger specials, both of which include a good helping of fries, and are both under $5. They also have about a dozen flavors of shakes and all the typical deep fried goodies. I had the 1/4 with swiss, bacon, and thousand island dressing. It was a really awesome burger, and for just over $4 after tax, it's tough to beat. REALLY tough. It's not Delux, but it is a damn tasty burger.   A good bet for that semi-queasy "need something to soak up the booze" day after meal.

Enjoying it. I live near the restaurant and have been 3 times since it opened. The Jerk Chicken is very spicy and extremely flavorful, the curry chicken had a great taste, but needs caution while eating as not only are there bones, but there are VERY small bones. The avocado spring rolls are great, and the mango that comes with them is kind of addicting. The staff is friendly though never very attentive, and once mischarged my credit card, took 3 days to get it cleared up. They also list items on the menu that come with the entree, but dont show up. When you ask about that item, they tell you there is an extra cost for it... odd!  +1 for being a unique option to Phoenix, and +1 for being clean as a whistle.

Geisha is part Scottsdale, part Los Angeles, and part Osaka. What I mean by that is they have the cheap ass patio that is so common in scottsdale bars, with the goofy oversized pictures of rockstars that you would find in an LA rockbar, and the private karaoke rooms and "Japanese" food.   I tried a multitude of dishes, starting with the steak and chicken skewers, both average. The tempura rock shrimp, while a familiar dish at any japanese restaurant, was exceptionally delicious. Octopus salad was fairly weak, but it was followed by a trememdous steak stir fry. But by far the best dish, was the ribs. OH SHIT DAMN! I had ribs all over the country, and these were the best I have ever had. Hold the bone, and pull the meat cleanly off with your chopstick. It was the most tender, succulent piece of meat I have ever had. I WILL go back craving those ribs some day.   The place is very dark, and very loud so it is a good place to hang out with a group of friends and dance or drink. Not the best for convo. The private karaoke rooms hold from 4-20 people and are rentable from 40-100 dollars an hour, depending on the time and day. They do have waitresses that go in the rooms if you want them to. This is how most karaoke bars are in Japan.  The best part of the place by far is the bathrooms. The toilet seats are heated, power up and down, air freshened, self flushing, and they shoot water on your butthole and then dry it off. I guess I'm sheltered because I'd never seen those before.   This is a great place to have some rambunctios fun with friends, and the food is better than average. Everything was good for the most part, but the RIBS WERE AMAZING.  "I had ribs for lunch, thats why I'm doing this"

The ponytail guy who runs this place seems totally cool and you get the feeling that this place is totally white friendly. When you order though, you realize it is past white friendly and any self respecting Vietnamese person would be ashamed by this place.   My nem nuong quon was brought by some cold sore yielding individual who overcharged me by about 50 cents for my rolls, and the "nice" guy who seemed like he owned the restaurant acted like a dick when I ordered.

Tried this place on whim the other day. I could smell the BBQ from Indian School Road as I was driving by and it smelled great so I turned around and tried it. I was a little frustrated to see that it was cash only and I only had about 12 bucks on me. I ordered the pork sandwich, sweet fries, and a coke and the total was around 10 bucks. The lunch took forever. I came in at 1, and didnt get my sandwich and fries until 1:25 so understand they are slow cookers. I thought the fries were delicious, and something I'd never had before... I'd had sweet potato fries, but never with cinnamon and it was definitely a welcome change. The sandwich was tasty, and while a bit small, was definitely worth the stop. If you have a big appetite, I'd recommend ordering two of them as one just didn't do the trick. It's a small, clean place with great food.  No alcohol, no credit cards, and only one restroom make it tricky. But what do you expect with the space they are working with?

Pho Ao Sen really took me by surprise while on a trip to the East Valley, I decided I would use Yelp to help me find the best Vietnamese restaurant in an area that is known for having so many. I was skeptical since so many people are uneducated on the cuisine, the restaurant's website did not list many dishes that I enjoy, and there was much english spoken on the menu. Even their Bun Bo Hue required a special order of pig blood, and there was no mention of pate or ham hock. I chalked it up to an American place to get Pho, which is to Vietnamese as Spaghetti is to Italian. I mean, most American's eat it because it is "safe" and their brains are comfortable with it.   Whatever, I tried it anyway. This place blew my mind! I ended up ordering a "safe" dish because that is all they had on the menu and it really wowed me. Bun Bi Cha Gio, which is something that I actually eat quite frequently was so high in quality and so different from what I am used to. The pork tasted so well seasoned and was very interesting, bean sprouts were amazingly fresh and plentiful, cucumbers and lettuce were crisp and delightful. Overall, the bowl was as if someone had hand picked the veggies and taken them directly from the garden to the bowl. The nuoc mam was a little disappointing after seeing the amazing quality of everything else, it was still very nice but not as flavorful as I prefer. When I make my own I use a Thai Chili in each batch, so I'm just used to a little spicier.   Something here that is not so typical of a Vietnamese restaurant is the relative fanciness of it. They have done a nice job of making this a warm and inviting enviroment without it resulting in crazy high prices, such as you'll find at Cyclo. I was thrilled with the service, as it was the first time in ANY Vietnamese restaurant that I received a refill on my water without asking for it, and I've eaten Vietnamese for a LONG time.   Overall, I can't give Pho Ao Sen five stars because the menu does not have all the great dishes that is indicative of the cuisine and favors to the safe bets for Americans. I understand their target audience and who lives in the neighborhood, but I wish they would not sell themselves short and stay true to their roots. I will absolutely return whenever I am in the East Valley, as I loved the experience.

Really enjoyed my meal here. When you walk into the small home, you're greeted by a cooler with all of their different foods on display and you order at the counter. There is no signage explaining how this works, so when you do the normal process of ordering then walking to the register, you'll be told to pay when you're finished.   I had a tremendous panini which was part of their lunch special and included a freshly brewed iced tea. The quality was seemingly very good and I was really enjoying myself. I then asked the owner how he pumped out the food so quickly and why I could see them putting premade food in the microwave. He was both arrogant and defensive, understandably so on the defensive part. He insisted he is using a turbo chef and that the food is only 60% made so whatever. It was tasty, QUICK, and quality.  I'll go back again for take out on the way home. I'd say lunch and take-out are what it;s good for.

This is an awesome hookah and hippy shop.  I was going to go to trails one night to get some tabacco but decided to stop here. I'll never go to trails again unless it's for pie making supplies. The guy who owns the place is really friendly, and their prices are fair, if not better than trails.

I still confuse people when I use the term "Chinatown" in Phoenix. Maybe I'm being premature, but I feel like the Chinese Cultural Center is our version of Chinatown, outside of Chandler anyway which is like Asia v.2.  Besides the great restaurants here that everyone knows about, the Ranch Market is a great place to find anything that you can't find at Safeway, or what you can find at Safeway but don't want to pay an obnoxious price for. Example being soy sauce. I've begun to think that $4 for a bottle of house brand soy was normal, but Ranch Market offers it for $1.87... hey thats at least a fair price. They carry an amazing array of sauces, spices, vegetables, and fruits. The tea and noodle selection is fantastic as well. This is also where I go to pick up any cooking wine, vinegar, or sake that I may need. It's a cooks paradise if you do anything Asian.   The service here has been, to me, very nice. They are always able to answer my remidal questions like "is this the right fish sauce" or "what the hell is a galupity gackin."   If you're here on a Sunday, there is a kid who makes Chinese Pancakes for 50 cents. They are little two layer pancakes with custard in the middle and I honestly can't say how I made it 26 years without knowing about them. AMAZING!

I need more of this pizza, you hear me, MORE!  I have to admit after reading these reviews here, I had higher expectations for this restaurant than probably anywhere else I've been. For the most part, Pizza A Metro lived up to the expectations.  In some ways, it even exceeded.  We ordered the gnocchi and whatever pizza had the artichokes on it, and split everything. It was all delicious. The dough has the perfect flavor, and with what other reviews said, it was definitely cooked with tap water. Spend any time in NYC and you will realize that all great pizza is cooked with shitty tap water, and that makes or breaks the pizza. The gnocchi was amazingly light, fluffy, and had a great sauce. I don't care how small a portion it was, it was fucking delicious. Even the bread before the meal was better than I expected, with a delicious mix of eggplant, olives, onions, and good.   I counted exactly 20 seats, so this is a b a d place for groups, and it was all but deserted on a monday night. Good for us, we got our food quickly, and had a good time. I ordered a canoli before we left and wolfed that son of a bitch in about 3 seconds. Perfect flavors of amaretto and chocolate. The night went great, and I will definitely go back here plenty of times. One bite of the pizza and I knew it was my new favorite in town. I now go in this order 1. Metro 2. Bianco 3. Cibo 4. NYPD 5. Grazie

I'm going to have to downgrade Pizza A Metro after my last visit. It's still one of the best pizzas in town, and the service is still good, but they took away the amazing bread and tapenade they used to give out before the meal. They also raised their prices substantially. The Capriccosa pizza is now $17.95 instead of $14.95 so I still like the place, but five stars is not for a place thats just really good.

I grew up on these pasteries. Every Mothers day, Easter, Christmas, you name it, dad would get up at 4:30 to wait in line with every hispanic family in Phoenix to get a big pink box full of pasteries. I still get them some 20 years later every chance I get, they just do an incredible job. The Pina Empanadas with the extra flaky crust are quite possibly the best baked good I have ever eaten in my life. Yes, better than Tammie Coe, better than Sprinkles, etc. If you come in on the weekend past say 7:30 you're going to have slim pickins as all the good stuff gets gobbled up early.

How many curse words can I say in one sentence to describe how good this place is?  Holy f*****g hell, this is the best g*****n thing I've ever f*****g eaten that only cost $4 and s**t, b***h, it is good!  oh, seriously though, anyone who is a friend of mine knows I don't mind eating in a market in a neighborhood bordered by the projects. This place definitely fits that criteria. It's about 3 blocks north of Van Buren, on 20th street, across from the county hospital, and one of the most drug ridden project housing developments in the city. I don't care. The food here is absolutely delicious, and it is cheap cheap cheap.  I just got home from another visit, and for the first time, I found something negative to say. The cute little hispanic girl that was running the cash register, said to me at 8pm, "we are closed dude" as I was finishing up my last bite and starting to get up and leave. Maybe next time I'll try to get there about 17 seconds earlier so I won't inconvenience you.   Shwarma, hummus, kebab, kafta, etc. it doesn't matter, everything is all made from scratch, and when you order it, is amazingly delicious.

This review is on the store side, not the restaurant side, of chakra four.   I love coming here for their loose leaf teas because they have so many, probably over 100 and you can smell all the jars and open them all up to your hearts content. Every one of them which I have smelled and then purchsed, tasted exactly as it smelled when I got home and brewed it. They are not cheap, but what you get is a high quality product and the people who work here are very nice.   They also offer many medicinal herbs and suppliments with creative and sometimes humorus names.

Pretty fancy place they have here, nestled in a strip mall near a Boba shop, Lee Lee Market, and a Chinese restaurant. Pho Van has a large and well decorated dining room with a fish tank, plenty if gigantic televisions, and nice tile. If nothing else, they went a bit overboard with the decorating.   The service here is very friendly, prompt, and helpful. I observed a table nearby asking what just about everything on the menu was like, and the lady serving that table was very patient and explained everything in detail, described how it was prepared, and what it tasted like. I knew what I wanted coming in, so I didn't get a chance to "test" the server, but I'm sure he was just as good.   I really enjoyed my Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, as the pork had a delicious lime like marinade to it, and the egg rolls were crisp and fresh tasting. They are very generous with the portion sizes, and they should be for what they are charging. They definitely tacked on a dollar to their prices probably to pay for those fancy televisions and the new tile floors. My one bowl with no sides, drinks, or appetizers, was $11 after tip. Outrageous. I wanted Goi Cuon, but an order of two was $5.75! I also wanted a beer, just to say I had a beer with my Vietnamese, as most places don't serve it. Well, the beer would have been $4, making lunch here for one with a beer, an appetizer, and a main about $22 after tax and tip.   Would it be worth it? Probably not considering all of the place which cost slightly more than half of what Pho Van charges. Want to introduce someone to Vietnamese? Take a casual client out to lunch somewhere relatively nice? Maybe really want a beer with lunch? Pho Van is great. Want to have an inexpensive lunch and don't care about atmosphere, but rather just good quality food? Probably not a good bet. Your wallet will hate you here.

I love Yogi's Grill. I go there at least once a week. The place is spotless clean, and the food is much higher quality than Yoshi's, Tokyo Express, Kyoto, etc. They have a great selection of Ramune, a Japanese soda that I am addicted to. You also order at the counter and they bring it to you. The menu is varied from the usual, offering fresh sushi, yakatori, tempura and other items in addition to the usual bowls of teryaki. Their signature is the Arizona bowl which has crab and avacado... I'm yet to try this one. It's a quick lunch in Biltmore and has great food in a nice clean ambiance, they so far are doing MUCH better than the restaurant which was here before it.   My only issue is they do not offer a spicy teriyaki sauce, you have to make your own using siracha, which is some spicy shit! By far my favorite rice bowl restaurant though.

This store is kick ass. Picked up a pair of Jordan Spi'zikes today with no mark up they had plenty to choose from. I loved the sale they recently had on all the retro AJ1's too... picked up the red do the right thing pack for 30% off, came out to like $75 total.... for a pair of AJ1's! I dropped almost twice that on some pairs.   They have all the awesome shoes and can make special orders since they are a Nike top dealer. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeble. Weird that Adrian Wilson owns the place.

Foodwise, this is one of the best restaurants in the city of Phoenix (yes, I include Scottsdale, as well as all of the other surburbs, in "Phoenix") and has terrific service to boot.  Carefully created fun cuisine, with high quality ingredients. I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone here. Even those with a less than experienced palate can find something on the menu they will enjoy.

So it may be a hotel restaurant, in a convention hotel, downtown... but this place is for real. The atmosphere is decidedly W, or painfully Scottsdale. It's got the color scheme of Sushi Roku, the vibe of a big city restaurant, and food for gods.   It is connected through the lobby of the hotel, but also has it's own entrance, something the other hotel restaurants in the area cannot say. District is also privately owned, so you won't fall victim to any Sheraton miscues in the restaurant here, just thier own which I have to say there aren't many so far. The restaurant is dark and mysterious in the lounge area, and completely open in the dining room, which makes for a great social atmosphere all around. They also feature local artists with the wall art changing monthly, and it's for sale too! I'm glad someone had the foresight to do that, rather than buy some mass produced crap from Malaisa. There is a private boardroom style dining room in the back, with two large semi private dining rooms, and another large dining table overlooking the restaurant, so large parties would be great in this space. I'm thinking the large table in the dining room is the best as you are almost on a king's throne above everyone.  The food follows the same cues as the atmosphere. It's familiar, but fun and exciting... they call it "American Comfort" and thats exactly what it is. The menu features Shrimp Po' Boy Sliders, Mussels which come in a ginormous bowl with an incredible sauce, Short Rib w/chipotle grits, salmon, steak, and other familiar dishes with a little local taste. Our table enjoyed everything including the Organic Berkshire Pork with Memphis BBQ sauce, Mac & Cheese, and Applesauce. Also on the table were the Mussels, and the Caesar Salad which might have been the only dissapointment. I ordered the Short Rib, and we all agreed it was one of the best we had ever tasted. They even made Grits delicous. It's obvious that quality has been taken into account as all of the vegetables and meats are locally produced and purchased from small farms. Queen Creek, The Farm at South Mountain, and Schreiner's are just some names that come to mind. The chef was kind enough to come out and introduce himself about mid-meal and I asked him where he came from, the answer pretty much explained the entire evening to me. He is the former Executive Chef of the late Mary Elaine's, Mr. Belosic, and he explained he was just having fun doing something people would be familiar with. There was a dish on the menu that literally everyone would be familiar with, from Fried Chicken or Cod, to a Ribeye.   The drink list is pretty standard on the wine side, but the beer list is much more unique, featuring almost solely microbrews from New Belgium, Oak Creek, and Widmer. There is even an organic beer on the list. Though I wasn't drinking last night, I thought $3.75 was enticing enough for a microbrew that I'd go back another day to enjoy.  Perhaps the highlight of the night for me was when the bill came, not because I wanted to pay, but because like other restaurants they bring a little something with the tab. Most places do the apropos mints, chocolates, etc. Not District, nope, this place brings you a big cotton candy on a stick, a la the state fair from when I was a kid. How cool is that? The bill came out to about $60 w/o drinks for 3 people, which honestly we felt was very fair, almost as though it were an underpriced Mary Elaine's meal. My only, and I mean ONLY gripe with the restaurant is more with the narrow visioned architects who designed the space. The patio has about a 3.5' cement wall, which is just high enough to make the diner feel disconnected from the street. It would have been really nice to do something glass, or steel, to engage the street and encourage people watching... plus it would feel much less confined, but oh well. I'll go back again, and probably again after that, especially now that I've learned they feature live music Thursday through Saturday.   Keep on Keepin' on District, and heres to hoping you open the floodgates of trendy, chic, urban hotspots in Downtown Phoenix.

I've been handing out a lot of poor reviews lately, and I hate to be so negative, but this one really deserves it. Sure, there are plusses and minuses, but some of the important aspects were all minuses.  I went in for dinner at about 6:30 and there wasn't a lot going on so I went in and ordered a red, green, and carne asada taco with a "lemonade." The girl behind the counter was boasting about their fresh squeezed "lemonade" and I like when it isn't canned mix so I ordered it. I went outside and got a seat on the counter looking into the building and after about 10 minutes they brought out my food. I was actually kind of amazed it took that long to make 3 tacos, but whatever, that was fine.   The first taco, the red, was ok. Perhaps it was the fact that it was overloaded with beans, cabbage, and other mixtures of everything that usually is on your plate at a mexican restaurant, but I thought it didn't really have a flavor. The green was much of the same, no real flavor, but not a bad experience. They were both just "meh." Maybe now would be a good time to comment on that "lemonade." IT TASTED LIKE A FUCKING SLURPEE FROM 7-11. You have got to be kidding me if you are going to tell me this is a fresh squeezed lemonade. For ***** sake you even told put slurpee ice in it. I'm not buying it whatsoever, that this has ANY real lemon content. Ok, so now that final taco, the carne asada. I had high hopes since the other two were so bland I thought maybe it'd be harder to mess up carne asada, but I was wrong. It had absolutely no flavor, and had a horrid texture I don't know if the meat was overcooked or what but it tasted like a taco with beans and cardboard. I had to douse it in lime and hot sauce to make it edible, and still bearly was so, partly because the hot sauce they provide is not so tasty either.   I didn't look for a restroom, but I imagine they have one, as they would never be allowed to build the restaurant without at least one public restroom. The entire concept of the restaurant is very cool, and I can see it being a good lunch spot during the winter months, if, and this is a big if.... they can get their food to taste like something delicious. And actually make lemonade. Guys, who are you trying to kid?

My relationship with Sushi Roku is a love hate thing, from beginning to end. I went with a group of 7 friends on opening day and we were able to get a reservation simply based on our positions at various hotels around the valley, and saw a 30 minute wait after our 8:30PM reservation, which was ok seeing as they squoze us in. When I pulled up, I was amazed at all the vehicles in the valet lot, so I kept driving and parked around the corner. The place made me feel small from the beginning!  The entire space is beautiful and very well done. It's hip, yet upscale, and a very fun atmosphere. The servers are very friendly even though some of them are not fully trained in the restaurant. The food I had was delicous. Tuna on fried brown rice cake was delicious, as was the salmon and toro sushi. The yakatori sticks were very bland and almost seemed as though they were done with a greek seasoning, rather than a sweet Japanese. The food did come out quickly, even on a day when the place was packed way over capacity. Drinks, however, were not so quick. I had 2 greyhounds @ 14 each and I swear neither of them had any alcohol in them and have heard similar grumblings from others as well. I have to assume their bartenders have previous experience from other places, but it didn't seem as such. I heard a LOT of smashed glasses as well. The whole night seemed like a mess for them.  The restrooms were very cool, if not a bit confusing. They told me to go in through the door to the restrooms and I saw a lot of women standing around and figured I was headed for the womens room. But infact the men and women share the communal sinks and waiting areas, but have their own bathroom area, which was different. I feel the atmosphere was definitely typical Scottsdale but a little different in some areas where it was obvoius they put some neat touches in it.   I had one major gripe with the place, a little out of the restaurants control, was the overzealous attitude of their loss prevention department. These guys thought they were professional bouncers at Las Vegas night clubs.  We had been going back and forth between the restaurant and the lobby all night with no problems. At one point a big black guy said I cant come in, and this was after my whole party just went in front of me. I said "look count chocula, I've been in here all night, and all of my friends just walked by you. Don't stand there and tell me your hands are tied or you are over capicaty or something like that, because I know it is bs. I'm going past you." His co-worker came over and told him to let me in. The guy would have beat  me into the ground if he had wanted to but it worked out.   They need to get their security department going in a proper fashion, and work on the bar quite a bit, and the place will be a real winner. I'm sure that it will come with time, so I'm giving it 4 stars under the assumption that it is going to improve in time.

I'm going to start being tougher on my reviews, starting now.   This place WOULD NOT give me a water cup larger than a 6 oz Styrofoam cup. We waited 20+ minutes for our lunch orders of orange chicken to come to our table at Taiwan Food EXPRESS. The orange chicken then tasted like liking orange peels.   I was unhappy when my bill came.

Krispy Kreme is the best donut, by far. The donuts here at this location are not truly the Krispy Kreme experience, but at least adequete. I've been once, since I struggle with losing weight and things like donuts dont help. They were reluctant to serve me at the drive through because I was on my bike. I thought the general rule was do not serve non-motorized vehicles... and never pertained to motorcycles. Whatever, they served me anyway so no biggie. When I got the donut home (5 blocks) it was kinda hard and cool. I don't remember it being warm when I got it. I was pretty dissapointed.   If you want the KK where you watch the donuts come out of the production line and then get a free one, you have to go to Mesa, otherwise they are being trucked in.

Went back to America's Taco Shop last night for my fourth time. I used to think it is over-rated and too expensive, and after last night, I'll just say that it truly isn't very good. $20 for dinner for two is reasonable enough, but the food is absolutely the blandest, most americanized, excuse for Mexican I've ever eaten. I grew up in Phoenix, in a hispanic neighborhood, eating Mexican for almost every meal every day. This place is not the least bit Authentic... it's just a gringo excuse for mexican food.  The patio out front looks like some amateur do-it-yourself'er made a trip to Home Depot and built a budget enclosure. Seriously? you put plywood up in your parking lot... that's not really a way to make a proper patio. I can't believe the city allowed this debacle.   The kid who took our order on our last trip didn't know what was on the menu and repeatedly asked the woman there what was included in our meal. Learn the menu before you go up front and start working... this is not his fault, it's poor training and management.   Please boycot this restaurant so it can go away and the building can be used for something useful. There are a lot of great places up and down seventh street, but this piece of crap brings them all down to a lower level.

I went last night to their opening/sake tasting, and had a bite to eat. One thing I know I can say confidently is the neighborhood is immediately different. It was no longer the quiet, vagrant ridden neighborhood that it was even last week. It gave it a certain vibe, and the impact was immediate.  It's too bad Johnny couldn't have got a bigger space. Much like Fate, the confusion starts when you come in the door with a small space for the hostess, and a DJ booth which you have to squeeze on by. The restaurant cant have more than 10 tables, along with a bar, open kitchen, and a somewhat odd seating space for the bar that is totally hidden from the restaurant.   A lot is the same as fate, from the music, to the size and space, and the colors. The difference is the food, which will probably appeal to a broader range of people at this restaurant compared to Fate. The small plates are not really generous in size, but are great if you want to snack or nosh while you drink. Sure, you can have dinner here, but be prepared to really shell out.   As I said in my District review, I think the floodgates are opening to hip and happening restaurants, thanks in part to Sens, the newest addition.

Crazy night I had trying to figure out how to spend my Fox Restaurant $25 gift card. I wanted to go to Blanco, but it was packed and I didn't want to wait. Olive and Ivy was the same story, so I decided to head back into the city almost forgetting True Food.   I was the only one at the bar, and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful. Didn't hurt that she was gorgeous as well, but that is besides the point completely. The whole restaurant is distinctively Sam Fox with the raw woods, bright colors, and really unique lighting. I hit the bathroom right away and that was the coolest part of the restaurant (I'm a sucker for neat-o bathrooms since I'm working on a remodel of mine) with the water-free urinal and Dyson Airblade hand dryers. I'd never seen those things before, and I must say they are the first air dryer that I have ever found to be worth a crap.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sliders, which were unbelievably delicious, and at $13, not a bank breaker. They came with a Sweet Potato Hash that was great as well. The Hummus was also phenomenal, and probably the best I've had in quite some time. The menu featured plenty of organic, vegan, and and vegetarian offerings as well as some boutique wines. I never knew there was a type of wine that was both organic and sustainable using recycled products. There was a lot of thought that went into the menu here and I think they should be applauded for it.  The restaurant is instantly one of my favorites, from the list of $20 bottles of wine, to the awesome food, to the neat-o restrooms and the spot on service. Everything about the place screamed greatness. $31 for 2 beers, an appetizer, and an entree is very reasonable in my book, especially considering the quality. If you're looking for a big filling greasy meal, skip true food. If what you want is a healthy, delicious meal that won't leave you feeling like a fat grease-ball, eat here and be happy you just found your new favorite Biltmore restaurant.

Riding around Old Town today I couldn't choose which new restaurant to try, Metro, Digistif, or The Mission. Glad I chose The Mission.  This restaurant is beautiful inside, with the beautiful chandeliers everywhere. They have great hardwood floors and travertine throughout, and a beautiful bar. There were no mistakes made in the design of this restaurant.   The food is expeptional, and they call it a modern latin american. A mix of Peruvian, Ecudorian, Brazilian, etc. I ordered the pork shoulder tacos, and while incredibly small for $14 they were the best tasting tacos I have had in a long time, and definitely on the unique side. They serve you three of them and they are about 2 inches across... very small corn tortillas. I want to try something else next time for a bigger meal.  The service was perfect, however I was the only one in the restaurant. This is my new favorite lunch spot in Old Town. They need to either lower the prices or up the portions for it to be a 5 though.

Back to my days as the doorman at the Wyndham across the street, I used to watch construction of this restaurant. Such a great old building, and I was so happy they were finally doing something with it. I've watched progress in person and in pictures, as well as chatted about it with my friends, and three years later it is finally something.  The inside of the building is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. They did a great job with the old department store, and utilized a lot of space very efficiently. There are some neat touches here and there, one being the empty elevator shaft with a plexiglass cover, and some mirrors so you can seemingly see forever. It's not that deep! The restrooms upstairs (shame they are ALL upstairs) are awesome, in a white room surrounded with mirrors. I felt like I was in a padded asylum with mirrors, the asylum because I couldn't figure the place out. There is a DJ booth above the front door that is very easy to miss, and really a cool touch. The colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme, and did I mention there are mirrors everywhere? The building and space get a 5. It's just cool.  We sat at the bar and were followed by a friendly little asian guy, with menus and he seemed genuinely interested in us having a good experience. He was previously across the street asking people to come over and try the restaurant. I wish I could say the bartender was half as friendly or committed to his job. The bald one was extremely unfriendly, seemed very arrogant, and for a person in a loud restaurant should practice his vocal skills. The service was prompt without mishaps throughout, but very cold.  I ordered the Carne Pizza. I have to say, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a loooooong time. I have made better pizzas in my home oven that came from a box. Honestly... it had a paper thin cardboard like crust, no quality toppings, and not exactly a memorable taste. It tasted fine, and that was it's only redeeming quality. My neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better, or higher quality. The deli counter at Safeway can make a better sandwich. I earlier chastised someone for judging food on opening night, but now I see it really is bad, there is really no quality.  No sandwiches come with sides. No fries, no fruit, no salad, nothing. They are about $10, and if I want a great sandwich for $10 I'll go to Switch, and it will come with a great Caesar Salad on the side.  This is not a restaurant, but rather a bar that serves food. If I think of it like that... more like a bigger version of The Roosevelt, I can think a little more positive about this, but not much. Bad service, bad food, bad review. I'll not be coming back, even with the walking distance proximity. It's just not worth it, especially for the price, and to feel like a not busy staff doesn't want to be busy. We are now at the point where there are other options downtown that are better. It's no longer a Downtown where you can be mediocre and survive.

I hate to say it, but this place might be the king when the economy picks up. They spared absolutely no expense and built what I believe to be the most beautiful hotel in Phoenix.   The lobby, entry courtyard, and front areas are all just average and you don't really take into full account what you are about to see. Walk further twoard the spa, and you will be blown away. They feature lounge rooms, locker rooms, treatment rooms, reflection rooms, Hammam rooms, water rooms, and hell all sorts of things.   See the spa, see it see it see it. It is un-fucking-believable.

So I gave the Blanco in Tucson a less than favorable review, yet at the same time I couldn't wait for this one to open. Sure, I miss Taneko Tavern, and all of its sake covered glory. At the same time Fox RC always opens up clean, safe-bet, fun restaurants and Blanco is no exception.  The restaurant is brightly colored, with loud lounge like music, and an overall buzzy feeling atmosphere, even if the uniforms make me feel like I am at a frat house. I wouldn't come here looking for innovative Mexican cuisine, because Blanco serves a very American style of cuisine, but with tortillas. They have an obvious American atmosphere, that makes me immediately think of the spa crowd coming here before or after their treatments or in between shopping stops. You'll also see a lot of older folks that come from Paradise Valley around lunchtime or for mid-day drinks. Hey, if you don't have to work, then why not drink your day away on $12 margaritas, right?  The salsa is a sweet, almost candy like substance that goes very well with their grease puff tortilla chips that are glistening-golden brown. Their menu features 8-10 different tacos, all available on either soft white corn tortillas, or yellow corn fried shells. My favorites are the steak and ahi tuna, both full of flavor ($12) and plentiful for a meal that doesn't make you feel like you overate. They also have several entrees which feature steak, seafood, and chicken between $14 and $22 which I have only sampled a couple, both very satisfying.   I've never gone into Blanco craving Mexican food, expecting Mexican food, or telling my guests they are going to get Mexican food. It's always been well received by those who I have brought here, and always a fun place to be for a couple of drinks on a busy Friday night. Seriously, the name is Blanco, Spanish for white. Shouldn't that be a dead give away this is American food?

The coolest new bar of 2008.  The Lodge is located in Old Town Scottsdale in the location that once housed First Watch, but has been empty for a few years. It is modeled after a ski lodge, obviously, like others have said but it is done in such a cheesy way that it is awesome.   There is pine everywhere, the place smells like winter, and the drinks are not too expensive. The back room has couches, games, and pool. There are plenty of tvs to watch the game, and plenty of booths on the side for larger parties. All of the servers I encountered were friendly and helpful, but our waitress was obviously overwhelmed by our party of 25 last night. She actually brought me another beer after I asked her to close my tab. She was very nice and offered to take it back but I drank it anyway.   They also should have done something for bigger restrooms. 2 urinals, 1 stall, and 1 sink are not nearly enough for this bar. Hell, it's not enough for a bar half this size. I hate to imagine what girls have to go through for waits. This bar seemingly is not scottsdale, but thats only on the surface. The people that come here I honestly believe went out and bought their flannel and fur before coming here, just so they could look like mountain people.   Scottsdale douchebags will always be douchebags.

La Frontera is the surprise find of the decade for me. In a city full of street side taco trucks, you'd never think that one would be so tremendous, but there is a reason La Frontera's truck is in the same place every day of the year. It's un-flipping-believably good.   Upon first inspection, La Frontera is a mangled parking lot full of haphazardly parked cars, a few bums walking by every now and then, and a lot of neighborhood folks. The unassuming "restaurant" is made up of folding tables and chairs, a blue tarp as a sunscreen, and a truck full of awesomeness. The menu has all the Sonoran Mexican favorites like tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and chicharonnes. One will order at the counter using as much broken Spanish as possible, while the employee uses as much broken English as possible. Eventually you will find a medium, and you'll complete your order of amazing. When your number is called in Spanish, you'll get your order along with the typical limes, radishes, cucumbers, and salsas. Upon request, they have grilled jalapenos available at no charge.   The food here is truly fantastic. The tortillas they use are fresh, homemade, gooey flour tortillas. Their meat is grilled to perfection and marinated exquisitely, which is something you very rarely find in a Mexican street food shop. My pick is the Burrito de Carne Asada, a large flour tortilla teeming with hot grilled beef, beans, salsa rojo, onions, and a bit of cilantro. If you're a taco lover, you'll love the barbacoa beef tacos, a Mexican style BBQ meat with an almost briny, indescribible taste. Wash your meal down with one of their many bottled Mexican sodas, and consider yourself lucky that you got to try one of the finest examples of Mexican street food in the state. I'm so spoiled now and hold just about every burrito in town to this standard... which has led to many disappointments.  Be forewarned that La Frontera is cash only, and basic knowledge of Spanish is recommended, though not necessary. Just remember these phrases and you'll be good "Burrito de carne asada, con todo" "para llevar" "es todo" and remember your number. You'll never desire any other burrito from America's again, they just don't hold a candle to La Frontera, especially at twice the price.

Cool place with a good staff! I'd actually walked in a couple of times to browse after getting a haircut next door and somehow managed to spend 10+ minutes in the shop without being spoken to. On my last visit though, I actually had a purpose, grips and a brake bleed before I hit the trails and the owner didn't hesitate to take my job on as a walk in with a time constraint. That was pretty cool of him to do.   They carry a nice selection of bikes both road and mountain, and stock nearly all accessories you'd need. Unlike a lot of shops, they don't hide things in back where the customer can't see them. I've never understood this tactic, wouldn't you want to put your items on display so you could sell more? I never think to ask if someone has something, rather if I don't see it I generally assume they don't have it.  So, kudos to bike cafe for at least displaying their inventory.   My work was done promptly, at a fair price, and was completely 90% correctly. I had to make a few adjustments when I got on the trail, but it was simple and I carry a tool for that sort of stuff anyway.

We have to throw out kkdkat F's review. What the hell is it with people reviewing a business that isn't open yet?  My experience was fortunately when they were open. I went Saturday night, their third day open, and it was a glorious night. I missed the 6:30 reservation but still only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. They were very accommodating with my friends 2 year old and did not charge us for her to sit at the table and eat scraps of his food. If you have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse (as I hadn't) it is a ridiculous idea. You flip the card to green when you want food, and red when you don't want food. Problem is that the food guys come so much that a mere 45 seconds of "green" will have your plate full of more meat than you could possibly consume. To offset this meat bonanza, they do offer a salad bar.   The place kind of reminds me of a Golden Corral, but upscale, where you don't have to get it yourself. The clientele is old, overweight, and un-sophisticated as you would expect at an all you can eat restaurant. The price ($42.50) is high enough only to discourage the dredges of society. I saw quite a few younger people out on dates, probably not ones that would have the palate to appreciate even restaurants at half this cost.   The salad bar alone ($19) was more than well enough equipped. Featuring 8-10 different salads, raw vegetables, and a few cold cuts. Each meal includes three sides that are shared family style, a fried banana, mashed potatoes, and polenta which are all replaced the moment you finish one. The trick if you do not want another, is to leave a bite of it on the platter. They wont replace it if it isn't finished. They also bring the most delicious bread imaginable that has a warm, gooey, cheesy center. The two year old ate 6 of them.  Meat service includes 15 different types of meat here, of which I tried about 8 and they were all on the decent to good range. The only exception to it being the lamb chop which we both agreed was the loser of the bunch, with the favorite being either the bacon wrapped filet, garlic beef, or the parmesan encrusted pork chop. All items are served in small portions, enabling you to try several different ones. I don't think I had two of anything. It is definitely a huge meal and my recommendation is to eat nothing all day, and then be very concerned what your cardiologist might say afterward.   The restaurant is probably going to last through this depression at least, as they serve in high volume and turn a lot of tables. It isn't uppity enough to turn away the low end clientele, and it isn't crappy enough to turn away the affluent folks. The service is spectacular. I don't think I asked for one thing all night, and the food is good. My only gripe is the meats were all very well cooked, which is obviously a testament to most peoples tastes and not wanting to actually taste the meats. It would have been nice to have a "rare" option, but the did decline the request.

Since it's trendy to review this circle K.  This is the only circle k I have seen that lets you use the restrooms, and about the one you'd least WANT to use them. It's pretty gross. The bums hang outside all night, but not the indian ones (feather) as they all hang at 7th street and roosevelt. This one is more for the blacks and disabled. I once went here with a few friends to buy beer, and we actually made it to the westward ho and sat and drank our 18 pack of milwaukee's best out in front. A few bums came and made friends with us. We felt right at home here.  So yes, craziest circle k, but not the creepiest or scariest.... if you're wasted.

It's Taco Bell.... I swear it must be fucking Taco Bell.  They have the same purple hours signs with white font, and their chicken burrito looks identical to Taco Bell's Grilled Stuft Burrito.   I wonder if their fried chicken is a knock off of KFC as well?

Pros:  The best bartender in Phoenix, Jonie, is now at the Turf. It's not nearly as dirty as Seamus. The patio is nice.  Cons:  What's with the feeling that it is a music venue. The most empty space ever.  In no way do I feel like I'm in an irish pub. It would be better fitted in say, DC Ranch where old douches could hang out and feel "Irish" before they go home and bbq in the back yard while listening to Jimmy Buffett. There is no soul, feeling, or unique aspect of this place whatsoever.

ok so here is the skinny on a place I have been anticipating for quite some time. Hurry 4 Curry is small, basic, and completely neat-o.  Ordering is done via touchscreen televisions and and paid for by swiping your credit card. If you want to pay cash, you can do so at the counter. You'll slow things down for sure, think of the visa commercials. They are pending a liquor license right now.  The people working there were nice, and offered to help me with the ordering process. Sorry, if you can't figure this out, you need to go off yourself immediately and stay out of the gene pool.   The food is premade, and in 5 pots in the middle of the kitchen. When you order, they go get a plate, put some rice and some main dish on it and bring it to you. The food I got was tasty, albeit a bit underspiced. They are planning on staying open until 9pm nightly. I thanked them for their ambitious plans and let them know I hope they don't give up like a lot of places do.   If you live in the city, and like this place, I ask you to do the same. It would suck if I got used to this for dinner and they changed to say, 6pm closing.

This is a good ballpark. I noticed quite a few things that I like about it and very little negative marks. The one negative, however really sucks.  They charge for parking, lets get that out in the open. I don't go to many spring training games, but I do know that I've been to games at Maryvale, Surprise, and Muni and have never paid for parking. Hell, to Muni I can ride the train which is great. Getting out of the parking lot is a pain in the ass. The game I went to had attendance of 4,000 and it took us 15 minutes to get out of the lot. We had a few encounters with westside trash on the way driving their lifted trucks trying to cut in line and use the size of the vehicle to intimidate me into letting them have their way. It didn't work. White trash, stop breeding, please. The stupid baseball sculpture outside invokes the emotion "WTF IS THAT?!" I truly hated it.  Everyone we encountered at the park was very nice, especially in contrast to Surprise which employed some of the rudest and most gruff old men I'd ever come across. At least Goodyear had people welcoming and wishing a safe trip home. It shows they really want your business and want you to come back again. I like that. Most of the seats are in the shade, especially on the 3rd base side in the second half of the game. It seems the design has all the right seats in all the right places. They also have a great amount of lawn seating in the outfield. There truly isn't a bad seat in the place.   If they get the parking under control, I'll be able to say this is probably the best place to watch a game in the Cactus League. For now though, I still like Maryvale for it's intimacy a little better. I posted a few pictures as well, hope you like them.

Stay as far away from this place as you can, please.  The staff is a bunch of squids, ill informed about everything and anything, who will do anything to get you on the most expensive bke they have.   On my visit, I was ready to purchase a pre owned R6 and after many minutes going back and forth, was told I could not be approved on that bike, and I needed to buy the NEW model R6S, because my credit was shaky and only Yamaha Financial would finance me and they would only do it on a new bike.  I went and purchased my second Triumph the next day on a 72-month 3.9% loan....   They are either incompetent, or liars... my guess is that they are liars.

Postino is a fantastic restaurant, both in atmosphere, and food. The service has always been on average to above average levels on my visits.   Parking is a major issue here and you may need to valet to get a spot. They don't charge for it, but I always hate feeling obligated to tip someone 5-10 bucks to park my car in a free parking lot. The restaurant is pretty small, and can be crowded as well, so be prepared for a wait from happy hour on through the night.  The food here is absolutely fantastic. Their bruscetta (brew-sket-ta for you illiterate fools) is off the charts. I recommend the ricotta and date. On monday evenings after 8pm you can have bruscetta and any bottle of wine for $20... can't beat that with a stick.  I also really enjoy the Autostrada Panini as it is truly the most flavorful meat sandwich ever invented. Mmmmmm meat sandwich.

Call me a hater, but you all are brainwashed.   Edit: changed my review to two stars to be a little more fair.  I will start off by saying this is by far the best restaurant the Clarendon has had yet, though that isn't saying much considering their track record. The place is very unassuming and actually has a very comfortable feel. We were absolutely confused where to go when we walked into the restaurant. You can't tell where the bar ends and the dining room begins, and they don't have a set up hostess stand (the one they have is in the middle of the room) which you can easily find. Our hostess looked at us oddly for a couple of seconds before I let her know "were here for dinner......"  After being seated, our server came over and we told her it was our first time and needed her help choosing. She described everything to sound absolutely delicious so we ordered away. I started out with the Picolo, a drink made with jalapeno, tequila, lime, and muddled seasonal fruit. Sounds delicious, but this is where the night took a turn for the worst. I took a taste and just about dropped my glass and my head twitched.... it was so tart it was undrinkable. I'm a guy who likes my sour candy and sour anything, but this was almost painful to drink. I told the server and she started laughing and apparently assumed I was kidding???   I ordered three tacos, and a side of rice. I first tried the Cochinita, which I have to say was an absolutely butchered dish. Does this white boy need to go over and give lessons to you people about how to properly cook a Mexican dish? YOU DO NOT PUT GUACAMOLE ON COCHINITA PIBIL. You also don't used tough, chopped pork. You use shredded and slow roasted pork. You don't put chunks of fruit in it either. You ruined one of the greatest Mexican dishes of all time. The Carne Asada had a wonderfully textured and tender quality, but fell flat on it's face when it came to flavor, of which it had none. I tried the Ahi Tuna taco as well, which also was covered in guacamole. You can't just cover all of your food in guacamole and pass it as mexican, unless you are trying to hide a lack of skill in the kitchen. I ate my "guacos" (not tacos) begrudgingly.   My girlfriend ordered the guacamole and proclaimed it to be completely average, but I'd have to say otherwise. I took a bite on a chip only to find a big chunk of orange slice. Really? People order this, and then come back and order it again? This is actually the second Mexican dish you've managed to butcher, after the cochinita pibil. I won't even start on the rice, which was not cooked properly, was covered in cilantro... and I mean COVERED, and was borderline cold.   Service here is good enough, but I had the feeling the whole time that our server was simply going through the motions. When she laughed and told me she was glad I liked the drink I was complaining about, all the way to the end when she asked why we didn't finish the guacamole and couldn't understand why we weren't licking the bowl, she just flat out was off.   The meal was absolutely a bastardization of the Mexican cuisine. You all are trying to damned hard to be "cute" and made yourself look like inexperienced buffoons in the kitchen. I have to tell you that this place is probably only surviving because it caters to a niche and because some yelp superstar decided they like it, and all their sheep friends followed. If this place had to survive on it's own in the real world (outside it's "I'm to hip to go anywhere that cool people wont see me" atmosphere) it would fall flat on it's face, just like every other restaurant this hotel has dreamt up.

Hungry Monk is the newest addition to my "I wish it were in the city" list.   This place features craft beers on draft, and it's not like that range of places that offer whatever keg is going to sell the best because they want the money. This guy stocks beers that are actually interesting, hard to find, and really worth the trip. I had a Lost Abbey Judgement Day and my girlfriend had the Dead Bastard, which is basically just an Arrogant Bastard and a Rogue Dead Guy mix, not a complitation between the two breweries. I found this a bit odd but whatever.   I didn't have any food, but this place definitely gets it when it comes to beers.

I was so surprised to see boba in the city that I flipped a bitch in rush hour traffic to go here. This wasn't particularly special boba, but the almond milk tea with boba was delicious and the prices were better than lollicup or any of the places in chandler.

I order the same thing at every Vietnamese restaurant. Rice Vermicelli Bun with Grilled Pork and Egg Roll, and spring rolls. This order does not change. Ever.  They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I don't know which I prefer as they are very very different.  You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. It's pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive.

Friends, Coworkers, and acquaintances have been hyping up Zipps to me for years. The wings, the burgers, the shuffleboard, the tv's, and well just about everything about the place has been hyped to the point that I was dying to go there when I found out they opened one across the street from my favorite sports bar, Hazelwoods.   The beginning of our visit didn't start out so well, when we asked for sound on the Suns game and heard the response "we only do sound for big games or if people request it." Firstly, it's a big game anytime the home team is playing. Maybe you're new to Phoenix, Mr. Manager of a Sports Bar, but you need to figure out that Phoenix has always been a basketball city. Also, the sound has been requested, we are requesting it, and I was told when I called at 4:30 PM  that sound on the game would be no problem. I told the manager about my previous phone call and he didn't seem to care. 15 minutes later he came by and said "ok, some people requested sound so we are going to turn it on." damn, was it that hard?  Food came, and I ordered the golden medium wings I'd heard so much about. Hmm, these wings were neither meaty, crispy, or quality. They sure were tasty, but the quality was not there. I had the Wednesday special of four chicken tacos, and they were also of low quality. I know this is a sports bar and I don't expect tremendous cuisine, but c'mon, don't insult me with this garbage. I'd have been better suited eating chicken mcnuggets from McDonald's. I was in for $40 having three beers, tacos, and wings. I couldn't have been more unimpressed. I've spent half the money at Hazelwoods and Native New Yorker and been twice as happy.  Now this was a kicker that may not be big to anyone but I thought it was pathetic. Their shuffleboard table has bars on it that prohibit anyone from playing unless you put money in it. I've NEVER seen a bar which doesn't allow you to play complimentary or even just hold your keys like Pomeroy's or 16th Street Sports Bar. Ridiculous. Lame. Awful. Also, their TV setup was not what I expected. I don't think there was anything bigger than about 50" and with how high on the walls they were, they were kind of difficult to see from certain places.  No sir, I don't like it.

Cool place with a good menu and fair prices. Overall I found it very enjoyable for lunch. We sat outside on the patio and had a nice day.   I thought the veggie burrito was very good, healthy portion, and high quality + tasty. They make their own fresh lemonade, which is also tremendous.   I was, however, a little put off that they have someone bring you your food and buss your table. I only say this because it is a counter order and super casual... the kind of place where I go when I don't want to have to tip someone for service, but then I felt obligated when he brought my food.  All in all a very good experience, and it's blatantly obvious that Kathy Hayes designed the interior, and did a great job of it. It's a fun space. Love the take out window too.

In two visits to Hula's, I feel it is a strong two star establishment and there are several reasons why I feel this way.  Food quality seemed good, but menu items I tried were fairly bland and not very interesting, though I do find this holds true at many "hawaiian" restaurants. Drinks here are stiff and during happy hour you can pick up a nice buzz for very little money, and this is a plus. The restaurant is nicely designed and modern feeling, hence the name Modern Tiki.   Televisions here, I'm assuming, are reserved for 50 year old batman movies, cartoons, and Hawaiian videos, since that's the only thing I've seen on the screens. I never understand movies in a bar with no sound, they don't make very good background ambiance as they are designed to be heard and draw you in. If sports were on, it would be great because you can glance up every now and then between conversations and see whats going on. You don't have to watch a whole plot unfold.   My last visit, after a day of mountain biking with a friend on Squaw Peak, we stopped here for happy hour and sat on the patio. They turned on the fire pit for us and even though we were seated next to it, it provided little warmth. The fire pit did however overwhelm us with the odor of propane burning. Oh well. We asked to split the bill, mine card and my friend's cash. We handed the it to the waitress and I said "put the remainder on the card" yet she came back with two separated checks... both charged to MY CREDIT CARD. I asked why I would want the bill split up on my card and where the cash went. She said she thought it was a tip ($13 when the bill was $22) and I said no, you were supposed to take the cash off, then put the rest on the card. Please refund my card the amount of my friend's meal, and apply his cash toward that. She argued thats not right and refunded both meals on my card, took the cash, and said we were good to go. I signed the bill but I wonder if I was ever charged. She was doing her business a disservice with her awful, awful, serving skills.  On another visit, the bartender spent my entire time there acting like he was too cool to be at work, I was bothering him by making him do his job, and I wasn't welcome to sit there.  This could be a nice spot if they cleaned up the service problems and added a little oomph to the food. For now, I say it's a pretty restaurant with good stiff drinks. Service and friendliness is half the battle though. Unhappy/dumb as rocks staff = unhappy customers.

This place is the dopeness.  Awesome pizza (pistachio, onion, and ricotta) and a great Caesar salad. The atmosphere is very welcoming and is actually a pretty nice restaurant. Chef Matt owns it on the pizza oven.

This is a great restaurant for women to go to while they are shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square. It's a great menu for men because of the amount of red meat. See a problem there? I do, and it makes me upset to say, because I really want it to thrive. But when you make a restaurant which so heavily appeals to women, and then build the menu and style of cooking around men, it makes one wonder.  I hope it works, because the dishes we tried were great and the typical hip, fun, happy Sam Fox atmosphere was there. The restaurant is what I would describe as "pretty" so it may not be a place for guys night out, but it would be ideal for a group of girls shopping, a guy picking his wife up after she shopped, or just anything that involves women. The bar was very different however, and gave a much more masculine feel, while in contrast to the restaurant it felt like the most masculine bar ever made.   My short rib was tender and delicious, and my girl's filet was one of the best she had in quite some time. We also enjoyed the cheesy potato side and the mushroom side. The bread they serve prior to the meal is stuffed with bacon (weird but oh so delicious.) BY FAR the highlight of the meal was the peanut butter cup, a dessert so delicious I can't even describe it.  The price point is WAY up there. $30-$75 for an entree which does not include sides, salad, or any extras. Plan on spending at least $60 per person plus cocktails, and at $10-$16 each you can really rack up a bill.    Great food, and service was PERFECT!

I don't care that it's a chain. This place is OFF the chain.  I'm a beer nut, and they have everything I could ever want, just about. They carry all my favorite Stone, Dogfish Head, Rogue, Bear Republic, and every other great beer that I love. They also carry all the beers that people with no tastebuds drink, and all at VERY fair prices. They even carry kegs. I spent a fucking hour here the first time mumbling "holy shit" over and over in my head. It is somewhere between sliced bread and indoor plumbing as to how great their beer selection is.   I've discovered that you don't need to spend a lot on vodka. Total Wine carries one for $8.99 that is one very good bottle, highly regarded all over europe, but unknown to us Americans.   I'm a bit of a wine snob as well, and they have a lot of my favorites at 75% of what Sportsman's charges. I love Sportsmans, and I would always rather support the local guy, but sometimes if the prices are too good, I have to go corporate. They carry Stag's Leap 2005 Cask 23 Cabernet for $149! It's well over $200 at Sportsman's.  Their service is very good as well and most of the employees know the beers well. I asked about Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous and I mumbled Stone S.. and the girl cut me off and said Sublime? Yeah, we don't have anymore and won't get it till next year. She knows every beer in the store well enough that you only have to say half of it. Nice!  My only gripe, and it's not major, is they are REALLY ghestapo-like in terms of watching for shoplifters and carding people. They literally sit and watch the cameras waiting for someone to steal just so they can pounce. They also have to hand record every id they look at which really slows down the check in process.

This is a really enjoyable addition to the neighborhood. I used to spend my friday nights here when it was Nick's 24/7 pizza. There used to be punk rock shows all the time. Babbo did away with the old floorplan completely and turned it into a really nice little modern neighborhood spot.  I sat at the bar alone and had the penne with pink sauce, garlic, and chicken. It was a ginormous bowl of pasta for $10 and I think I may be one of the only ones who could actually finish it. VALUE. It wasn't super low quality crap either. It was decent food. They also include your before dinner bread and olive oil. All and all with an iced tea it was $14 including tip.   It's a solid place and the staff was very friendly. I had conversation with three staff members while I was there and they all seemed happy to work where they do. Happy staff = happy customers.

This used to be a premier rice bowl restaurant and now it has turned into absolute garbage. The staff is seriously rude, they started using a different chicken, and it doesn't taste or feel the same.   I go now to Yogi's on Camelback for a better experience.

This place is not what I expected. I expected a hipster bar with a decent selection of beers (it says ales) in a funky but cool building. What I got was an alcoholic bar with a shit selection of drinks and beers, and a bunch of 60 year olds who had been drinking alone since 'Nam ended.   This place is grimy, dirty, and kind of scary. There were a few charachters who came in through the front door and scared the crap out of everyone. There was a guy smoking in the bar and the bartender didn't ask him to stop. It's just a shit hole.

This was so much fun. We drove out the other day just kind of for the hell of it and were really surprised.  You get pretty much run of the place. You can go in any building, climb on stuff, and explore. It can't be safe.... you'd have to go there to understand, but there are open holes in the ground, nails, and falling wood. We also observed lots of snake skins. I had my snake shot loaded in my pistol so whatever but one might be concerned with little kids.   All of hte old artifacts are great, and everything looks well preserved. Going on the second story of a falling down house was really interesting to me!

Don't come into Tottie's expecting traditional cuisine. What you'll get here is that traditional dish that you wanted, with Tottie's own interpretation on it. She prepares Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Sushi, with the Tottie twist on it.   The atmosphere has a lot left over from when this used to be the French fine dining spot Methode Bistro. It's cozy, warm, casual, and very inviting and Tottie is a very friendly lady who loves to talk bout food, share ideas, and greet all of her customers. In fact, I was not having the best of experiences here until Tottie came over to see me, since her servers had zero knowledge of the Asian dishes they were serving people, but Tottie was a little more knowledable. Scratch that, a lot more knowledgable.  My Bun Thit Nuong Tom Cha Gio was presented in a way that was very different, using traditional ingredients but with a few extra ideas thrown in like field greens, extra carrots, and a little different style of presentation. The server informed me, upon finding out how much Vietnamese I eat, that I would find this dish very different because it came with a unique Tottie Sauce...... it was traditional Nuoc Mam, LOL! Despite the confusion, the food was top, top, top quality. Very fresh and crisp veggies, good cuts of pork, huge shrimp, and crisp egg rolls. I was truly happy with the dish, despite it being different from what I'm used to.   At the price point $10 a bowl of Bun Thit, it's one of the more expensive fixes in town, but given the quality and atmosphere, I'd go here again and not think twice about the extra couple of bucks.

Arizona Falls is a not-very-well known attraction on the Arizona Canal at 58th Street. It is one of my favorite places in Phoenix to go and to take out of towners to. It once was a watering hole for people and was a hydroelectric dam. In 2003 it was rebuilt very well and had gorgeous waterfalls put in overhead that you can walk under. It is open 24/7 and is free to visit. It's hard to explain how amazing this venue is so you'll just have to go visit for yourself.

I've not been making good choices lately about where to dine. I have been dying to go to Sucker Punch since they announced the resturant. I figured the location would be great and the old Ruby Tuesday's would be a clean slate for them to build a really cool restaurant out of.   Boy, was I wrong. Having been in that Ruby Tuesday before, it was obvious they put a coat of paint on it, recovered the booths, and put a minimal amount of their own very repetitive art. Suffice to say, the restaurant looks like shit. It's not cool and divey like a diner should be, and it's not pretty and upscale either, it's just like someone put lipstick on a pig and called it a day. I was actually almost at the point of wanting to walk out. The way they decorated this place and the lack of effort to build out the restaurant screamed that my meal was going to be terrible.  I ordered the Denver Omelette and my girlfriend ordered a cheeseburger. We both commented on the lack of selection on the menu. You can have either traditional breakfasts, omeletts, burgers, or three different entrees. I think I counted 11 selections on the menu.   The food here is TERRIBLE.  My omelette was a big soaking pile of grease, with terrible quality ingredients. I swear this is true.... I've had better omeletts at IHOP and Denny's. The hash browns were average to good, but then again they were hash browns. Biscuits, terrible, and they didn't bring me honey or butter or anything. The burger looked very bad too. The shape of the burger was about 2 inches tall and 3 inches wide. There was so much bun outside of the burger. It just was not made properly. They definitely fucked up something as easy as a hamburger ordered medium that was dry as a bone and a gross dark gray color.  Our server was nice, and that's about the only saving grace, but she was terribly inexperienced and didn't properly bring our meal, condiments, or drinks. I understand this place just opened, but the inside of the restaurant is an absolute joke and the menu is bad. I don't think those are two things that are going to just improve over time. The service and food quality both can improve, but they will have to a lot in order for it to survive, because right now this place is an abortion.

Ok, so I was walking around with nothing to do and hungry at breakfast time when I noticed they opened up two new restaurants. Which to choose, the Mexican, or the American so I just went to the one that looked the least busy and I'm glad I did.  It's a walk up and order at the counter place, nothing fancy, and they call your number when your food is ready. The hours were 7a-3p according to the sign on the door so yet another place that is only for breakfast and lunch... you'd think someone would want to be open for dinner to cater to the people living in the building, but oh well. The Chorizo burrito had to be one of the best chorizo burritos I'd ever had. I grew up in Maryvale for f*'s sake, I know my Mexican food. I didn't expect anything here to really be good, but this burrito was freakin' awesome. For $2.99 you get a shit ton of food, and with an orange juice only cost me $5.25 out the door. Cant beat that price either. I recommend anyone who works or lives in the are to give it a shot. It's probably not worth a drive from the suburbs, but damn, one hell of a breakfast.

I did not eat anything here, so based from a bar patron's perspective, this place is a good bet. Early on a Sunday evening, Mabel's was pretty quiet so we were able to carry on with the staff and it was a much more enjoyable experience than what I expected from a place in Old Town. The bartender, Heeley, was a friendly guy who definitely liked to converse, and when we realzed almost all of the staff was like this, it was very nice. One of the waitresses was lighting candles and kept burning herself by holding the lighter upside down to reach the wick. When I told her she should hold the candle sideways and she wouldn't burn herself, she looked at me like I'd just invented a cure for cancer. Priceless!!!  They have some nice daytime specials, an inventive drink menu, and it is a very neat Victorian atmosphere. Good place.

I quite like Pita Jungle and have been to three of their locations. The downtown location is not only a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but it's also their most beautiful and usable restaurant. The space is very large and features a full bar and a patio. This is something I was aggravated by at the Tempe location is they have no bar, and the Indian School location has no patio. They also did a teriffic job of keeping the integrity of the old Gold Spot Market that they are located inside.   The service here is impeccible just as normal with Pita Jungle. Friendly servers, cute waitresses, prompt delivery from the kitchen, and efficient seating. The food is high quality, tasty, and inexpensive. The black bean burger is probably my favorite dish here. A beautiful balance of spicy, smokey, and salty.   Pita Jungle yum.

I read about this place in New Times and saw two words that always speak to me like they are some alluring foreign language.... COCHINITA PIBIL! I've made this dish at home a couple of times, and it takes me a couple of days, so when I get to eat it it is a real treat.   Went into La Condesa around 7:30 on Thursday night and went straight to the counter and ordered the glorious achiote and orange maranated pig, along with rice and beans and a homemade horchata. Chips were included. While I was waiting for food, the people running the place were over the top nice. The man told me about some tips to making cochinita pibil including using cinnamon, which I'd never done. The girl actually introduced herself, shook my hand, and asked my name. I've never had anyone do that in a restaurant. She proceeded to explain the salsa bar, which had about a dozen different salsas though they plan to have 20 in total eventually.   The chips were fresh, all 5 of the salsas I tasted were delicoius, especially the green cream and the watermelon. My Horchata was amazing, just perfect. They topped it with crushed nuts, and there were strawberry chunks and whatnot in it. Very unique but amazing. My tacos came, and I was quick to pick off the raw onion and replace it with the proper pickled onion slices as it should have come in the first place. No problem, they have the pickled ones at the salsa bar along with all the other veggies. The tacos were full of meat bursting at the seams... large portions were great for me as I'm used to such small tacos. Their refried beans were creamy and well cooked with a nice cheese garnish, and the buttery smooth rice was delicious as well.   For the fact that this place is nice, decorated with dia de los muertos style art, mexican wrestling posters, the niceness of people, and the excellent food, this place gets five stars as easily as any restaurant I've been to in Arizona. It reminded me of Mama Testa, which has grown to be one of the best known taco shops in San Diego. Phoenix has never seen anything like this. They asked if I want to come back, and I assured them, it will be soon. Very soon.

great selection, great customer service, nice people.   I bought a pair of boots here that about halfway through a day of wearing them, I discovered they were not the same... right boot was kind of irregular. Even though they had been worn outside, they took them back no questions asked, and were very nice and helpful selecting another pair to replace them.

I got in a fight with a Diamondbacks player here!  Rusty Ryal was drunk and slammed his car door into my vehicle. I flipped, and he was wasted and started telling me the dent he made was smaller than his cock. He called me all sorts of names, cops came, he got in an argument with a cholo who wanted to kick both of our asses because fighting was bad (???) They sell MD 20/20 "bling bling" Blue and the people who work here are truly weird. They have a redbox which features all the favorite ghetto flicks, and the water machine gives you 5 gallons for a dollar. They just installed the new Circle K gas pumps and they are already covered in graffiti. It's fun watching all the trannies come in here and try to get the emos and preps from Camden Copper Square to take them home.   My favorite time at this circle k is when I pogo sticked my ass all the way there from my house and pogoed drunk in the parking lot. Their rent a cop told me to leave so I pogoed in on the sidewalk and called him names until he called the cops.   Yup, I've been here 8,453,234.73 times and only had the cops called on me twice. That is a 99%+ success rate. It's a great Circle K.

Long Wong's is a staple that anyone who has lived in Phoenix for a decent amount of time should know about. They simply have the tastiest wings in town. Growing up I remember my favorite meals being the nights I could convince my parents to get take out wings from the location in Maryvale. I got a wild hair the other day to ride the train over to tempe for dinner, and select my location on the train ride there. After arguing, drawing straws, flipping coins, and playing short rounds of roshambo, we finally decided on Long Wong's.  This location is in a somewhat weird part of town, you've got your meth trailer parks, student housing, and nice older neighborhoods all together. Inside, it's a dive bar basically, and a very dirty looking one at that. I appreciated the place for what it is, but keeping it from that fifth star is the lack of cleanliness. The food here is essentially bar food, serving pizzas, wings, sandwiches, burgers, fries, etc. It's all on the "decent" or "good enough" level with the exception of the wings which are tremendous. If you order the pizza, prepare yourself for a really greasy mess, which is obvoiusly low quality, but it is tasty.   Service was spotty on our visit, but only because the bar was somewhat busy, and they only had one person working the bar/restaurant. We really enjoyed the "FIRE!!!" special, which is any drink in the bar you want, for just $1 when a fire truck goes by with the sirens on. I enjoyed my Jack Daniel's Single Barrel on rocks for a buck.

This place is to burgers what chipotle is to burritos, a little bit better than their true fast food counterparts. The staff I encountered was very nice and they bring the food out to you, clean up after you, and are very very friendly.   I tried their new Buffalo Smashchicken with Sweet Potato Smashfries. Both were excellent and I would return here before I ran off to Arbys, Five Guys, etc. Pricing was very fair at $8.75 for a sandwich and fries.

A horrific hangover and possibly still drunk on a monday afternoon, one might be turned off at the thought of a burger or a burrito. I know I was. Just thinking about the available fast food options close to home made me want to barf. Sushi sounded enticing.  Stingray offers several lunch bento boxes, each with cucumber salad, miso soup, a main, and a side that changes with each item. I ordered the sushi bento and it was phenomonal. Four very large slices of sashimi, three pieces of nigiri, and cucumber salad was more than enough for me. The quality was excellent and the prices were fair to somewhat high. I think my luch with tax, tip, and iced tea was under $15... not too bad for a sushi lunch at a high rent place like this.   The service was spectacular. I ate at the bar outside and I think the bartender must have been the most outgoing, friendliest girl I've ever had the pleasure of being waited on by. She was spectacular. I really felt like I was someones houseguest by my treatment. It was a very different feel from the old town location, where most staff feels very cold.

two stars in my book is below average, not horrible, but not good, and that's what I feel Hsin Cafe is.   In this location, you'd expect an inexpensive, large portion, take out style restaurant like Panda Express or the many copycat versions of it. Unfortunately for me, and for the students in the area, that's not what Hsin is. Instead, you'll find a very unpretentious but squeaky clean neighborhood restaurant with a somewhat limited menu of Chinese favorites, served with a "healthy" style.   The man who was running the dining room during my visit was very friendly but didn't seem to understand what I wanted, or perhaps just didn't want to budge. I really was in the mood for Orange Chicken with some noodles, but in their meals they serve white rice, veggies, and main dish. It's $6.99 for the meal which isn't outrageous at all, but I just wasn't feeling steamed veggies. I asked if I could swap the veggies and rice for a small portion of noodles, and he tried to sell me veggie chow mein for an additional $2 which would have made my meal $9, now it's sounding very expensive. The recommendation then was to buy a la carte Orange Chicken, at $5.99, and add veggie chow mein to it, at $4... That's $10 as well. Why not add some flexibility to the menu for people who want something different? Most places will give you a choice of this or that, but Hsin seems to have the attitude that this is what we have, eat it or leave. When I got home, I thought the hot and sour soup I ordered was completely average, albeit a very small portion especially for $2. My orange chicken came in a decent sized order, but tasted like someone dumped a bottle of sesame oil in the batch. If I want to suck on a bottle of sesame oil, I'll go home and stick a nipple on the bottle in my pantry.   The saving grace for this place is definitely its cleanliness, but the flexibility on the menu, the relatively high prices compared to the portion sizes, and the taste of the food is really all lackluster. You can be as "nice" as you want, and you can get away with mediocre food if you're really amazing with customer service, but Hsin is doing it wrong.

I've never been to a place so proud of their pizza and it's "accolades." It is a very nice space with a great atmosphere.  Unfortunately, this was a very poor experience for me from the get go. When I walked into the restaurant, the woman at the hostess stand just stared at me, while a guy who was the server stood in the door way. It gave me the feeling of being unwelcome. My Diavola pizza was mispronounced by me when I ordered it, and the server let me know that I was wrong (wtf? you knew what I meant, just let it go) and then rationed me for mispronouncing the owner's name of the restaurant. Thanks guy, you're a really friendly dude.   I've had some of the top pizzas in the country, and pretty much all of them in Arizona. First off, Pomo is in love with their Mozzerella, and this is personal preference, but there is WAY too much cheese on this pizza, it was all I could taste. The meat toppings on the pizza did not taste like they were top quality... they were ok, but definitely did not have the fresh/homemade taste of Chris Bianco's toppings. The crust was also very thick, and while the quality and taste was fine, the it was far too thick and doughy for my taste. Additionally, I've NEVER spent $17 on a pizza which couldn't be shared between 4 or more people.   With all the great pizzas in this city, this one is just an OK. I'd have given it three stars but due to the horrendous attitudes and sheer arrogance of the people working here, It's dropped down to two stars. Price doesn't help either. I can go to to Pizzeria Bianco and get homemade mozzerella, master crafted crust, amazing locally sourced and often home made or home grown toppings, for 3-4 bucks less. I don't care where you got your tomatoes, in fact, the fact you get them from Italy is actually a bad thing in my book. If you got them from the farmer's market, they would only be a day or two old... but getting them from Italy, I'd be surprised if they were less than a week old.   Yup, skip this joint and hit Cibo, LGO, Bianco, Pizza A Metro, Tommy V's, Grimaldi's, Grazie, Parlor, or any of the other fantastic pizza joints in this town. There surely isn't a shortage of them.

I like the uptown Vig better than the Arcadia Vig, for several reasons.   1. Uptown has an awesome enclosable patio, and is a much bigger place, which means if I don't want to touch the popped collar d bag roid rage s class driving bozo at the bar when I walk by, I don't have to.  2. The bocce ball court does not tilt 15 degrees left.  3. The menu is a little better, I think. I love the Turkey Sandwich on pretzel bread with cranberry chutney.  4. More TV sets.  It's Better!!

I must have ordered the wrong thing here. My hand pull noodles stuck together the same way the Safeway brand noodles I undercook at home stick together. The beef and its sauce was pretty darn tasty, but isn't this place supposed to be all about the noodles?  Service was completely rushed and they stared at us while we ate. It was so awkward.

The following is written by me, one of Richardson Browne's biggest supporters and fans.   This is an absolute 100% carbon copy of Richardson's. The window coverings, adobe booths, throw pillows, copper bar top, teal awnings, eclectic mix of soft rock, and even the prickly pear margiratas. The feel and atmosphere are almost the same. They even serve meals on big metal plates, often times with tortillas under them. Anyone who thinks this place is original needs to go see Richardson immediately.  All that aside, the food here is really good. I ordered the Carne Adovada which came a little drier than what I'm used to a Rich's place, which was a welcome change as they really let the pecan wood smoked pork speak for itself. The tortilla accompanying the dish was not tearable, but rather so dried out that it broke when I tried to tear it. This was the only dissappointment of the dish. Beans and rice were identical to Richardson's, smokey and delicious. The girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas, which to her surprise were the Red, White, and Blue Enchiladas from Richardsons. One chicken, one shrimp, and one cheese, wrapped in different colored tortillas smothered in green sauce. They were very much exactly what we were used to.  All in all, I'd say that Barbara, the owner, probably is using the same recipes and has obviously used the same formula here. She is doing a great job, and I will go back if I am ever in this part of town again. Even with the prices on the menu being about 20% less, it's not worth a 35 minute drive for me.

This is the first review I've written where I wish I could give more than five stars.  I was so hesitant to try this place based on all the hipster reviews and and the preconcieved notion that is overpriced stuff that appeals to granolas and hipsters. Well, that may be true, but I think it appleals to everyone as well. I ordered the Noki, a dog with green chiles, pintos, cheese, and an all beef Schreiner's hot dog. They serve the dogs on flatbread which is awesome beyond belief! The taste and quality was definitely there and the portion is enormous.   Where I really want to give this place more stars is the service. I want to say they have worked in high levels of service industry before because name usage was constant. They took my name for the order and used it at least three times in conversation with me. I noticed they had a catch for bottle caps from the sodas they sell, so I asked if my girlfriend could have them for an art project she is doing. Not only did he say she could take them, but gave her a ziplock bag for them, offered to save them from future days, and tried to refuse when I recognized the great service and gave a tip.   in short (get it?) these guys get how to run a business. They are friendly, helpful, serve high quality food, and go above and beyond what the customer wants or needs. They take credit cards as well through a Droid app the guy has on his cell phone, and you sign with your finger on the phone's touch screen. I don't go to the market much, and I try not to eat hot dogs, but if I'm ever out and about when this truck is there, I'll definitely stop by again.  One hundred stars, thanks again guys!

This place is too cool for school.  Nobuo is a nice guy, and an absolute master of his trade. Nobuo comes from Sea Saw in Old Town Scottdale, which was part of Peter Kasperski's empire that seems to be falling apart more and more. When Sea Saw unfortunately closed, we all knew that Nobuo would either run off to California and open up there, or come downtown. Glad he came back to the city, and turned an awfully ran old tea house into a fantastic, spotless, neighborhood hang out.   The building, built in the early 1900's, is a beautiful Japanese tavern style, from the furniture, to the art, and onto the gorgeous solid one piece bar top. He hangs out behind this bar and creates his culinary masterpieces here right in plain view. The waiters and waitresses, meanwhile create your unique cocktails made with fresh fruits and veggies as well as fresh garnishes. I tried the cucumber martini which was fantastic. Look for the specials each night and try whatever they are. Nobuo also does Omakase (chef's choice) where you and three of your closest friends sit at the aforementioned wood counter and try whatever he puts in front of you.   At some point in the night, you'll wonder how much you're spending. Nobuo at Teeter House is not cheap, but good things aren't cheap. When you purchase fresh produce from McClendon, fish from Japan, and rent in Heratige Square, you have to charge a premium for your product. If you don't understand this, then you shouldn't shy away from Taco Bell anymore. They do offer a great happy hour M-F if you want to save money, but I recommend Nobuo for a night when you don't have to worry about how much your spending. It's a very special restaurant, and deserves to be enjoyed in a very special way.

When the announcement was made in early 2010 that Lucky Strike was coming to the neighborhood, I knew it would be special, and I knew it would be something that changed the game in Downtown Phoenix. Opening night at Lucky Strike went swimmingly, and it has been getting better and better ever since.   The atmosphere is reminiscent of Big Lebowski, which coincidentally was the model bowling alley for the first Lucky Strike. It's a small bowling alley with only 12 lanes, a lounge and bar area, and pool tables. Make no mistake, it isn't cramped, just a small place with a lot going on. By day you'll enjoy well lit lanes and a bright casual atmosphere, but by night, that all changes drastically. Lucky Strike is predominately a night club on the weekends, when the music is loud, the lights are low, and the sexy people are aplenty, sometimes three deep standing at the bar with a 2 hour wait for a lane. Some say the Old Town crowd has moved in, but I say it's a diverse and fun mix of people all with the same intention of dancing to old school hip hop, bowling, and having some fun downtown. The bowling lanes are a little nicer than your standard bowling alley. They have newer and better scoring machines, TVs behind the pins, and all state of the art technology. It's really fantastic.  Throughout dozens of visits, once as many as three times in a 24 hour period, I've recieved both exceptional service and awful service, with no real consistency either way. One visit, we sat down at the bar by the window in the back of the club, and were told we could not order drinks there. Another visit, I waited 15 minutes to get my tab after requesting it, though we were the only ones there. Other visits, the service was so perfect that we felt we could may as well be guests in someone's home. The staff here is all friendly, and everyone seems to like their job. I have a theory on the service, and that is the way the managerial staff has the place set up. It doesn't flow well for the servers. Example, there is a bar right by the bowling lanes which is never open. The other bar is around the corner, down the stairs, in another room. Servers must go here to refill a drink or get a beer, which makes it take forever. They should really work on a way to make food and drink service more expeditious.   By this point, I've tried every item on Lucky Strike's $5.50 lunch special (lunch, soda, shoes, and one game) menu and they have all been good. Some of the standouts for me are the Turkey Brie sandwich, a mixture of sliced turkey, melted brie, and apple butter on a Ciabatta, the Bleu Mini Burger, served in a duo (you can mix and match with other types as well) with house made french fries. You really can't go wrong with any of it, though. The happy hour menu features half priced "Lounge Menu," $2 domestic drafts, and I forget what else from 4- and 9-close 7 nights a week. I love the pretzel dippers, served with garlic butter, mustard, and cheese dip, as well as the Beef Skewers with a spicy and sweet glaze. The same mini burgers are available at happy hour as well.   In actuality, if you're a hardcore bowler, you might not care about all the flash and bang at Lucky Strike. You might not care that there are beautiful women serving you food and drinks right at your lane while wearing little black mini skirts. You might not notice the DJ booth in the lounge area, and you surely might ignore the animations on the screen when you get a strike, but for those of us who can't seem to muster more than 125 a game, and really just want to hang out in a cool place with great food and friendly people, Lucky Strike is heaven.

Growing up in Phoenix, Patriots Square Park was one place we never went. Under no circumstances did we feel safe there even as teenagers or early 20 somethings. The day RED and the City of Phoenix decided to redevelop this block with apartments and retail, along with flexible outdoor event space, I was ecstaic. I followed the development from day one, took challenge in trying to figure out where loading docks, support beams, kitchens and bathrooms, and everything else would go. I was obsessed, and had such high hopes. Cityscape failed at a few of the points, but is still a development which has changed the Downtown CBD for the better.... the way better-er-er-er-er.  As of the date of this review, Cityscape isn't fully open yet. I feel like all these one star reviews are very unfair, and I'm instead giving a positive look into what will become. Same example of a newlywed couple walking into a wrecked foreclosed home and instead of seeing a blank canvass to create something great, they see a piece of crap home.   My first positive impression is the way they changed Central and Washington. The intersection now has a beautiful and busy looking feel to it with both Charming Charlie and Urban Outfitters all lit up and night with corner entrances. They did a great job of keeping the non-destination  retailers on the ground floor, and placing the places that one would make a special trip for upstairs. The CVS was a great score for downtown, bringing us our first drug store in decades, and the bowling alley above it is a fantastic place as well. So all in all, they did a nice job of bringing us unique and interesting mixes of retail and restaurants. There are no big huge white trash chains here, and it creates an urban feel that downtown doesn't have in too many places. Those of you who are saying it's not urban, I have to ask you... do you even know what's going on over on Jefferson Street or on First Street? It's going to be a full block of storefronts.   Cityscape, as a downtown resident, and a native Phoenician who has used downtown as his playground forever, I thank you for everything you have done for my city. You've created a playground for not only myself and my friends, but those from out of town who previously had almost zero options for shopping. You brought us another tower, and intregrated great lights on top of it to make it more interesting. You brought us another hotel and more jobs. Most importantly, you made something great out of a park which was underuitilized by everyone other than homeless. With Civic Space Park now open, I don't see what the draw would be to Patriots Park anyway. I mean, Civic Space is a better park location anyway.

Oh, That's a Wrap, how I love you.   2002, my brother lived in Coronado before it was trendy to live there, and it was still somewhat frightening. He is kind of a granola type, and took me to That's a Wrap for lunch one day. It was absolutely fantastic. Healthy, clean, something for everyone, and high quality. Flash forward 8 years and the owner sells it to the manager and they move uptown. It's actually better than it ever was.  Now, TAW has a patio... a really awesome patio. They have the same menu with the same food, and now stock beer and wine. They didn't fuck that up either, as they are carrying Oskar Blues beers. If you don't want to drink, you can have a big cup of China Mist iced tea... unfamilar with China Mist? They are a local company who does phenomenal flavored (and thankfully unsweetened) iced teas. Good job TAW, get a beer and wine license and a patio, and you make me really happy.   Now, as if all of that wasn't enough, the lady who manages it is so frickin nice it's crazy. She has a very cool attitude and is extremely helpful.   If you're visiting for the first time, try the Prince of Thai's, Buffalo 66, or Godfather wraps, they are all great.

A new player in the Downtown Phoenix food scene, Bliss is a creation by the folks behind the Fez, Switch, and Ticoz empire. They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.  Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently "comfort food" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste.   My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food.   Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being.   I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.  I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the "vip opening." c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it.

Five Guys is a burger chain from Arlington, VA with a plethora of awards, a cult following, and a firm endorsement from President Barack Obama.   I must have walked by the Tempe location of Five Guys about Five Times and never felt inclined to go in. I was either not hungry, didn't want a burger, or was turned off by the appearance of the place. White, red, florescent lighting, loud "classic" music, stacked bags of potatoes, and huge crates of peanuts. It's like Fuddrucker's died (actually fuddruckers did die... RIP) and In N Out had relations with it's dead carcass and created Five Guys.  Their prices are definitely not fast food prices. I had a "little burger" with fries and a soda and my total was just shy of $10 which is about $5 less than the same thing from prime burger joints around the valley. The girl behind the register did a nice job of explaining the menu to me, but was texting I think at the same time so her concentration was not there when I had a question, and it still wasn't there when she made my burger (yes, she made it) because she forgot some of my toppings. I found the burger to be about in line with Denny's or Five and Diner. It was better than fast food, but not by a huge margin. The fries were God-awful soft messes. This may be personal preference here, but I want my fries to be crispy and NOT TASTE LIKE POTATO.  I wanted to enjoy my experience as it's a place to walk to from home, but honestly, for the quality to price ratio, I'd rather get in the car and drive ten minutes to Fez, Delux, or Richardson's for that Green Chile Burger, which are all $10. They don't include any fries, but c'mon, with a really good burger you don't need any sides. Overall, it just wasn't good, and I'll be asking Barack for a stimulus refund for the cost of my burger.

This Tempe outpost of Buffalo Wild Wings is their 700th store. Just about 3 blocks from the Rural/University train station, it's a very convienent location to access via transit. They do offer complimentary surface parking which is something that cannot be said for downtown Tempe locations.   The atmosphere is exactly the same as every other BWW. Over the top TV visual stimulation, bright white lights that would blind you if you looked into them, and a ridiculous amount of people in the restaurant at all times. I asked for one of the TVs to be tuned to the Diamondbacks game, and after trying to find it for 15 minutes, they put it on a small TV because the big one was carrying a U of A v. Iowa football game. Look, not only is this game a 4 days old replay, but you're in ASU territory so please put the LIVE broadcast of the HOME team on the big television. They refused. About 5 minutes later, another bar patron asked that same TV showing football to be changed to Cubs v. Giants, and there was no hesitation on their part to get this done. I was a little befuddled.   The food is shy of average. When I go to a place that specializes in buffalo wings, give me some decent buffalo wings. These things are tiny, overcooked, balls of grease. I tried the garlic parmesan, spicy garlic, medium, and asian zing sauces. The garlic parmesan was kind of gross, the asian zing was identical to the bottle of Mae Ploy sweet and spicy glaze I have in my refrigerator. The other two were fine sauces, but the meat portions and quality were crap.   On my visit, they had just opened two days prior so I'll cut them slack on the mishaps, which were plentiful, on the bartender/servers part. I won't however, write a review without mentioning the behavior of the managerial staff. Is this amateur hour? The TWO MANAGERS got out a book of ID cards which supposedly had every ID in the country with pictures and ways to tell if it's fake. Every out of state ID they saw, they referenced the book. What I have to ask is if they are managers of a big time chain restaurant, shouldn't they have seen an ID or two in their day? Don't they have a history of working in bars/restaurants? Shouldn't they have carded people in the past? I then watched them brushing their teeth behind the bar. Lost my damn appetite. The employees aren't being trained quickly because the management team is a bunch of buffoons.  FYI, if you recently turned 21 and have a vertical ID, don't go here because they won't take it. Someone needs to tell them they are by a college campus. I watched at least a dozen people be turned down for drinks because of the vertical ID.

So many poaitive thoughts come to mind while I think of Canteen. The extremely friendly bartenders Sunny and Jessica, the fantastic happy hour from 4-6:30 with half price tequilas, and the amazing tacos.   Canteen is a legitimate player in the local food scene, and it comes to us from MILL AVENUE?????? Yup, it's true, a grown up reataurant on mill. Go here.

I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:  THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed.   Vitamin T will fail, there I said it.

At Citizen Public House, my Ty Largo sightings continue. I see that guy damn near everywhere I go, so it must mean Up Agency is handling PR for this place. This has nothing to do with the review.  Citizen is a really cozy, warm, and inviting space, and is exactly the opposite of every other bar in old town. It is grown up, sophisticated, and has a huge emphasis on quality and interesting food. If you're looking for a greasy burger and fries to go with a Coors Light, you've stepped into the wrong place, compadre. If you'd rather go with a bottle of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch to accompany your Original Chop Salad, then Citizen will please your palate much more. A word on the Original Chop Salad, it's the Stetson Chop that you're all accustomed to from Cowboy Ciao. Bernie Kantak, the owner of Citizen created that salad whilst working at Cowboy Ciao, and it's his to take where he wants. Easily the most famous dish in town, in my opinion.   In my observation, Citizen is a douchebag free environment, a sanctuary for those who have become jaded from the usual Old Town bar scene. This would be a great place to have a drink after a night of dining at Marcellino or FnB, not a place to go before you head to Axis Radius or Myst. The white table cloths, dimly lit and somewhat romantic environs, and overal sexiness make this a great spot for a first or second date, or a perfect place to go before heading to the art walk or an event at the Center for Performing Arts.  A couple of small knocks on a place though; they don't have a great selection of draft beers, in fact , I was rather disappointed to see they had Guiness, Bud Light, a couple of Four Peaks, and Pilsner Urquell on draft. They have some really interesting and high quality beers in bottles, but unfortunately the girl behind the bar wasn't terribly experienced with beer and couldn't tell us much about one or two that I was unfamilar with. I consider this a very minor inconvienence and perhaps if business picks up and enough people request it, they will add some good beers to the tap, otherwise, I'd rather drink a bottle of beer at home than in a bar.  All in all, this is a solid contender and I hope it does well. The Old Town scene seems pretty dead to me lately, as on a Tuesday this is one of three places I went where my group was literally the only ones in the house. I'm quite sure the weekend business is better, but you can't survive if you're operating in the red 2-3 nights a week. Here's to hoping Ty Largo does his job and gets the good word out there about Citizen Public House. He owes it to the public to let them experience it.

I love Jimmy John's as of recently. I'd had it in Nebraska a couple of times and was never really fond of it because they didn't have mayo, mustard, etc.  One day, I realized that if you ask for "everything" on your sub, it means only about half of what they have and you have to ask for everything you want individually.   At this location, I asked for "all freebies except sprouts and cucumbers" which includes lettuce, tomato, onion, and something else. "all sauce" which includes mayo, mustard, and oil and vinegar. I then asked to add hot peppers.  When I got my sandwich, it had sprouts on it, no hot peppers, and no sauce. hmmmm  The second trip in, I just said I want everything they have except cucumbers and sprouts and it still wasn't right.  After taking your sub back to the counter and telling them they made it wrong, it ends up tasting REALLY GOOD, however I ordered delivery one time and it came wrong when it showed up at my house, this was especially annoying. It must just be a Jimmy John thing because Blimpie and Subway I have no trouble getting the sub the way I want it. If you go here, be really clear about what you want on your sandwich, and you will really like it.

Waiting for Arrogant Butcher to open, my patience was low, apprehension was high, and excitement was through the roof. Finally, the day has come when it was mine to try. Fox Concepts are hit and miss with me, as some of the ones I love are super cheesy (Olive and Ivy, Modern Steak, Bloom), and some that I don't love are ones that are extremely popular (Sauce, Blanco, and Zinburger.)  What sets Arrogant Butcher apart from the rest is it is the first downtown Phoenix restaurant that Fox RC has put out there. I'm sure they are nervous, and you can tell that from the design of the restaurant... it's much smaller than normal like they are testing the waters, yet in other ways it excels in the money spent meter. Three beautiful private dining rooms, a chef's counter facing the exhibition kitchen which they spared no expense on, and a great four sided bar in the middle. The atmosphere is a definite throwback to the 40's and 50's, which is nice considering you can't find that in many places downtown. It's truly a feel of an old tavern and restaurant.   Arrogant Butcher went out of their way to support local. Almost all of the beers on the tap as well as on the bottle list are Arizona breweries, there are pictures all over the restaurant of historic Phoenix landmarks and famous people, and they have done a great job of engaging the street with the patio and entrance. Yup, Sam Fox, the guy who is building a national empire of restaurants, brought downtown Phoenix a place that gives a nice sense of community.  As for the food, all apprehensions were set aside when the bowl of mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder, roasted grape tomatoes, and french fries came to the table. The dish was outstanding and had me wishing I could drink the broth. My main course of the crab stuffed chicken, served cordon blue style, with myers lemon and capers was also a very well executed dish. It was served with sauteed spinach underneath which I ate ridiculously quick. Other items on the menu sounded great, and AB offers a list of meats and cheeses, as well as a daily special that rotates weekly, and a nice array of sandwiches and salads for lunch. The desserts are fantastic as well, especially the peanut butter cup dessert, which is not served the way you would think it is, and includes cookies for dipping.   So no, this restaurant is not a locally owned, mom and pop style place, but rather it is a restaurant with a formula that is crowd pleasing, set in a location that could really use something of it's type, with the power to draw people in by the numbers. My biggest impression? on the first dinner service night, there were absolutely no hiccups in service. Our waitress, bussers, and drink people were all absolutely spot on. Keep it coming, Arrogance.

Vietnamese and Thai are some of my favorite cuisines in the world. They are "healthy" and have fresh veggies in most dishes, carry a nice amount of spice, and have enough interesting marinades and flavors to remain interesting over and over again. Cambodia, being between those two countries, has to be the same, I thought to myself. Well, yes, there are many familiar dishes and the use of a lot of the same ingredients. So on to Sekong by Night I go.   Knowing where Sekong by Night is, my initial inclination is that this restaurant isn't going to be around too long. The space has been the scene of many restaurant deaths, the signage is terrible, the parking lot is awkward to get into, and even knowing exactly where the place is located, it's hard to see from the east on Indian School. Try it. Forget all of those negatives, just give it a shot because if you like Southern Asian cuisines, you'll have a good meal here. I tried the grilled beef sandwich that was featured by New Times' Chow Bella Blog and enjoyed it very much. It was a tad bland because they do not use Jalapenos like the Vietnamese do in their Bahn Mi, but still enjoyable. Served on a French baguette, with pickled carrot and daikon root shavings, marinated meat, and cilantro, it was almost identical to the bahn mi. Then came the differences, beef instead of pork (apparently cambodian dishes are almost always beef, vietnamese are almost always pork, and thai are almost always chicken) and a soybean paste. MMM  Service here was very nice. I spoke with both the server and the owner for some time and they were very nice people with good English skills which was a pleasant surprise. My sandwich with a 40% tip was $5 out the door. Not too bad of a price for a lunch in a place that is nicely decorated, very comfortable, and close to the city.

To cap off a night in the east valley (what the hell is wrong with me?) we stopped at Shakespeare's.   The first thing I noticed is the obviously Irish motif. Celtic writing on the walls, mostly Irish feel, and even some Irish specialties on the menu. The restaurant, however, is supposed to be an English pub???? I understand this is the old Molly Brennigan's and they bought it, so I ask why not either keep it an Irish pub, or if you want an English Pub, remodel it?  Anyway, they had one guy working, and the place was full of soda drinking, apparently underage mormon girls singing bad disney songs on karaoke. I wanted to leave but my friend who lived in the area said it was the only choice around. Ok, I'll stick it out, we can make it fun.   When after the first round, we didn't see the bartender for upwards of 20 minutes, we took it upon ourselves to grab our own beers, and got our money out and still planned on paying the $4 per beer AND leaving him a tip just to keep him happy. He must have seen us during his karaoke escapades because he ran over and told us to leave. I reminded him (I was sober) that I told him I'd get my own beer if he didn't come back and he politely said ok. I didn't know it was illegal and I took him seriously when he said it was fine. Oh well, this place is bad service and a confused identity. Teach me to go out in Mesa, right?

This is a good Chipotle. The staff is obviously very happy to be where they are. They are friendly, make jokes, and they don't get mad when I ask for ChipotleAway.  I've never been upset about my food here, and at fast food places, the best result is to not be upset.
