The best Italian food in Phoenix.  The best pizza, pasta, huge ass salads.  Pino is from Potenza and is Italian at it's finest

One of, if not the best Greek restaurant in town, the Greek feta pita is amazing, I love the salads too, I've been coming here for years and the food and the service never disappoint.  I don't usually eat French fries but I make an exception here....fresh cut and delicious, you don't find that everywhere

If your car breaks, this is the only place to bring it.  You will be treated well and will not be talked into repairs beyond necessity.  My fear is that Chucks will become so popular that I will never get in.  This is really the best place in town

The food here is delicious, great portions at great prices, the lunch special chicken shawarma is fantastic.  It has been part of my weekly rotation for several months now and I keep forgetting to rate it.  The Dolmades are amazing and the baklava is only $1.50.....it's a must try

One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Phoenix, I love the red curry with pineapple and the drunken noodle.  The service is always friendly and the food arrives promptly and tasty.  It's a great neighborhood place that will make a regular out of you

I purchased a 2012 Suzuki Boulevard here and the owners manual they promised has never arrived (8 months later) the bike needed to be towed from a parking lot the first week I had it because the gear rod broke in half.  The service department was great but sales as always is a load of bull.   Looking at upgrading to a bigger bike but think I will have to find a different dealer

Just had my wallet and keys stolen from a locked locker in the locker room, it was brought to my attention that thrives target this location so then nothing is safe......go elsewhere, I will be now.

It's my first time here so I will try and be nice.  Skip the Yakitori Bowl.  Why in this country must we be forced to eat syrupy sauces, loaded with sugar?  The sign says healthy.  The ramen in this dish tastes like spaghetti, they are forbidden from frying anything but can add gobs of sugar?  Bring back the grill and loose the sugar canister.  I will try a salad next time....hoping for a better experience in coming weeks
