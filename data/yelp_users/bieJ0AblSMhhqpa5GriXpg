This is a really fun half day adventure for a family. My kids would not stop asking to come back.   Get the three pack and do the train, mine, and mystery shack tour. It is worth the money. My kids had an absolute blast and my wife and I had a great time as well.   You can turn this into a full day adventure and continue up to canyon lake or tortilla flats or up the apache trail.   After goldfield the road gets pretty winding so kids that get car sick either need Dramamine or not go.

We always love coming here for breakfast. The staff are always warm and pleasant and willing to serve. On weekends and holidays it can get pretty busy so arrive early.   Food is good quality and generally served just the right temp. Great coffee and their bakery is fantastic.   Comfortable and clean.

Let's be honest it's a car dealership so my standards are pretty low. That being said this dealership is high pressure and will not negotiate on their already high prices.   I was looking at a used vehicle. The sticker price 20,888. I asked about 18,000 since Kelly bb had the retail listed at 17,678. They said they could make it work in the payment. The payment?  I could care less about the payment it's the total amount you finance that matters.    You're not making anything work in the payment you're just charging me more in finance charges and extending the loan period. Plus I already have financing through my bank.   So I walked away. On my way out all of a sudden they remembered they had an internet price of 18,888. Really?  I was born at night just not last night.   At this point I was frustrated so I just said you're over by 888.00 dollars maybe you can find some other price as I leave.   Later on I found yet another price for the same vehicle on CL at 19,888. What this tell me is that they have various levels of douchebaggery happening at the same time.   Like I said my standards for car dealerships are not high but this was ridiculous. I gave one star because I couldn't give none.   Now the happy ending. I left and went to carmax purchased a vehicle four years newer with 30,000 less miles and more features. Get this for the same internet price they all of a sudden remembered.   I can't speak to the service department which in my experience is the best bunch of guys and gals in any dealership. Just the sales side of the house.    Beware and come in guns blazing. Don't take any crap and walk away at the first game they run on you.

Meh. And they won't accept ApplePay anymore. Just go to Walgreens up the road. Wait forever for scripts.

The best elementary school any of my kids have ever attended. We have lived in a lot of places but this school is amazing. My kids LOVE it their teachers. I don't mean they like them. I mean they love them. They love the principal and his admin staff. They love the janitors. There are great people at this school.   One of the best.

Fantastic restaurant. Service was great. Food was excellent. Their happy hour from 3-7 is great. 3.00 entree's.  Everything from a 1/2 pound burger to margherita flat bread pizza is just 3.00.    Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce.

One of my favorite places to buy tea. I enjoy every associate in this store. They are all knowledgable sweet people. The store can get insanely busy so be patient it will be rewarded.   Addressing some foolishness in other reviews;  They push tins. Umm if you have so little willpower that a sweet little girl selling tea can force sell you to buy a tin you don't want you have much bigger problems than the purchase of a tin.   Can't return sale/clearance items. Umm what part of we're getting rid of this stuff is difficult to understand? It also says that on all the sales labels. Never go full retard.   It's expensive. Learn how to buy the teas. Everyone in the store will help you learn if you don't act like a snobbish douche bag. I get most of my teas at 50% off or better. Being cordial goes a long way and people will go out of their way to teach you. Oh wait these people work retail I'm better than them.   Use your Starbucks card. Spend a buck on each purchase after 12 you get a free drink or 2 free ounces of tea.

I have never had a mechanic work on any of my vehicles. I have always serviced them myself  But, now I am forced to. I am a disabled veteran and just don't have it in me to play grease monkey anymore.  I found these guys through yelp and kudzu. Probably the highest rated mechanics on both sites. Let me tell you, it's not just hype.  They are outstanding.  The work they did on my Explorer was flawless and they used pretty much all OEM parts.  They put ceramic pads on instead of Motorcraft asbestos, which I prefer anyways.  They have earned my business forever. The Ford dealership quoted me $2,000. Family Auto Care did nearly twice the work and some additional preventative maintenance for $800.  I'm very happy with the work they did on my vehicle and will be bringing all my vehicles there from now on.   These guys do everything by the way so don't hesitate to call.

Fantastic PT's and assistants. Proof is in the pudding after six sessions I feel better than I have in a decade.   Equipment is clean and sanitary.  They are busy but not crowded.   Receptionists are extremely pleasant and helpful. Although many times they are too busy to great you. Just sign in and they automatically pull your chart. It's a bit disconcerting when you're a noob, but very efficient.   I love that people remember your name.

My family, three kids and me and my wifey really enjoyed this little pumpkin patch.   Nice little hay ride around the patch and farm. Drops you off at their petting zoo with Donkeys, chickens, mules, goats, cattle, and pigs.   Plenty of port-a-potties scattered throughout the pumpkin patch. Food is the usual pumpkin patch fare and pricing.   People were very friendly. Hay ride driver and cashier were friendly. When my fourteen year old daughter wanted to be to cool for school the cashier was nice enough to treat her as an adult without my even asking.   The little one got two cute little pumpkins that they enjoyed decorating with foam stickers.   Overall?  Great value for $10.00. Seriously where are you going to find anything for 10.00 for the kids to be entertained for a couple of hours and get some fun fall memories.   Tips: Bring quarters for the petting zoo.   Bring cash for the food cart and carrots for the petting zoo.   They do accept credit or debit and will give you cash back if needed.

Great little water park.  It can get pretty busy on the weekends but during the week it is pretty comfortable. Chill lifeguards that's do their job and keep the kids safe. Really great sloped entry into the pool makes it easy for little ones. Lazy river and whirlpool are the kids favorites.

Great food. Friendly people. Fast service. Reasonable prices. What more do you need?  Take my money!!!!  Food is fresh and delicious spans the gamut of heavy comfort dishes like Mac and cheese to light favorites like an Albacore Salad.

So I have to say I was extremely concerned when I saw a three start rating. But let me tell you these guys and gals are fantastic at what they do.  If your worried don't be read this review so you know what you're getting into.   I think that the low reviews are a result of a crappy situation (car accident and all the stress associated) and not knowing how difficult the process is to repair a vehicle especially newer ones with all this tech built in.   My story: some dickhead in Tempe in a white Dodge Magnum rear ended me twice and then zipped off leaking oil and fluids everywhere. I didn't get enough of his or her plate to help Tempe PD so it was a hit and run. Fortunately I have great insurance through USAA.   Said dickhead caused a hell of a lot of damage, about 15,000.  Almost a total but not quite.   Sean and Joanna and everyone there were super helpful even though admittedly I was an ass because I was pissed. I apologized for being "that guy" and they just continued to show how professional they are.   The work they did getting my destroyed rig is nothing short of miraculous. And they finished early.  It looked great and they always updated me and I felt really gave a crap about what a seriously crappy situation I was in   I was scheduled to move to the east coast at the beginning of June and had to delay that because of the dickhead in Tempe hitting me.  When I picked up my vehicle (after they were closed BTW they waited for me!)  The battery was bad from never being driven in the month they had it just turning it over and testing power and repairs moving it around. It was hot so that battery went bad and sulfated in that stupid AZ heat. I called and told them and they bought me a new battery on the spot and saved my ass when I was half way to New England.   This wasn't a pay for it and we'll reimburse you this was a legit have them call us and we'll pay for it over the phone. Sean did this. Amazing.  So I did the gal at Sears was like they already have an account with us I will call and confirm. Fifteen minutes later I had a new battery in done.   Another thing I have learned is that these repairs are complex and take a few trial end errors and experimenting to get it back. So it may mean keeping an eye on things for a few months. It is really hard to find all the damage. Sure the big things are easy to catch. But there are so many small systems and connections that you just have to follow up when you find something that's not up to snuff. But service King is willing to do anything to get it back to just the way it was.
