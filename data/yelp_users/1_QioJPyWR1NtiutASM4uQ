YUM! Great price, and you don't feel disgusting when you walk out of the door. What more can you ask for from a fast food place?! Well...I do wish that they wouldn't serve Lay's potato chips and gave you an option of chips instead...

This food was not as good as I had hoped. Everything I ate seemed like there was something missing. Not to mention, I am almost positive that my Chicken Salad sandwich was made with chicken that was roasted the day before and as far over priced. I was NOT impressed...also, the menu is pretty comfort food-esque, which during the summer in AZ, sucks. I will not return here for dinner.
