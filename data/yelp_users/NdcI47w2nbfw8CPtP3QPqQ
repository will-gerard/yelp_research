I went to the Knock Kneed Lobster for the first time yesterday and I have to say I was very impressed. If I wasn't with someone who knew the place I probably wouldn't have stopped here let alone been in this neighborhood. I had the 2 fish/1shrimp and chips, The fish was flaky and good as was the shrimp. I also tried the fried Zucchini and the fried okra, both were crispy and not greasy at all. I am a fan and will be back.

This local Gilbert establishment has never disappointed me over the past five years I have been going there. My wife and I will stop there on a weekend afternoon for lunch and always walk away happy. I like to try something different whenever I go and always enjoy what I have. The staff are always friendly, the food is always good, and I am supporting a local restaurant; it doesn't get much better than that. I love the French Fries, they are seasoned really well. The lemonade is homemade and very good. Yeah Flancers!  P.S. They opened a Second location in North Mesa...1902 N. Higley Rd.

I work next door to the Orange Table and frequent it for coffee quite regularly, sometimes for lunch. The coffee whether you get an espresso drink or just a cup of coffee is always great. The food is always good, just make sure you have enough time to get it. Sue the owner is quite unapolegtic about the service, she insists that because everything is made fresh it takes time, I think they could still be more efficient and speed some things up. If you go for breakfast, get the any of the corn beef hash items they make, mmmm tasty.

I go here for lunch every few weeks, the food and service are always good. When I walk in I am usually greeted by the owner(I think), and seated right away. They make decent coffee, and keep your cup full. The half sandwich and salad lunch special is a really good deal, the sandwich is huge and you get a lot of salad. I also enjoy the skillets as well as the breakfast sandwich.   The wait staff is attentive and always very friendly.   I am a regular here, and don not see that changing any time soon.

We went here after reading the reviews on Yelp with high expectations, we ended up being pretty disappointed. We got there and were seated promptly and seen by a waitress right away. The chips and salsa were pretty good, although the bean dip could have been a little warmer. When the waitress came to take out orders I asked her what Gecko grill was known for and she advised us that most people come for the seafood dishes. With the advice from the waitress my wife ordered the Crab Relleno Burro and I ordered the Seafood Grande. My wife thought the Burro was OK but nothing she would come back for. My order, the Seafood Grande, was pretty disappointing. My biggest problem with my meal was the the "Pepper Jack" cheese that was melted on top of my meal was actually processed Pepper Jack slices, the taste of the cheese really took away from the meal. The beans and rice served with my meal were also pretty blah.   As a side note to the food, we were seated in viewing distance of the hostess at the door. She could barely be removed from texting on her cell phone to do her job. Apparently the hostess is responsible for making the utensil set with the napkins, which I watched her set the clean utensils on the dirty podium where the rag she used to wipe down menus was also sitting. She texted and wiped her face/hair while making the utensil sets, not once stopping to wash her hands.  This was a pretty big turn off.  I try really hard to support local businesses, I hope my experience was an anomaly, but I will not be back.

Found Butterfield's through a friend of my Mom's who had eaten there at their Illinois locations. When we got there my heart sunk as I saw the huge line outside waiting to be seated, I went to the counter and signed in and was advised it would be about 15 minutes, True to their word, we were seated within 15 minutes. They make a great cup of coffee and the fresh squeezed orange juice is great. I ordered the California scramble, it was phenomenal, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the portion as huge. My wife had the New Orleans style french toast, which is french toast with sauteed bananas on top, she really enjoyed it.   We enjoyed the food so much we returned with friend the following weekend.

Sushi Ave is within a mile of my house and I have probably driven past it a thousand times, I do not know why we have not tried this hidden gem sooner, maybe it was their location in a strip mall with a Checker Auto parts and a veterinary clinic. I'll admit I am not as adventurous when it comes to sushi places as I should be but the cooked stuff tasted really good. We tries their California roils, Spicy Crab rolls, Las Vegas Roll and some sort of "volcano" dish (All I know is they lit it on fire at the table, COOL!). This place is awesome.

We have been taking our dog Abby here for the past four years since they gave us a free wellness check after we got her from the rescue. Every time we go the staff are friendly, helpful and really seem to love animals. One of the techs Sarah always gets down on the floor and plays with our dog. Dr. Duplissis is really good and takes time to answer all of our questions. We have never been kept waiting, they seem to be on schedule most of the time. They are also accommodating, our groomers wouldn't use the shampoo we provided unless it was prescribed by the vet, so one phone call and one prescription later problem solved. The new facility they built a couple of years ago is really nice. I would recommend them to anyone.

We walk our dog here pretty regularly on the weekends, the smoothies are good, the coffee is OK, and Staff is friendly. Bu that is not why we go, it's all about about our dog! They have homemade treats for her, muffins, yappy yogurt, and all kinds of other things. They also have a great selection of natural and organic dog foods and supplies. If they don't have an item they will order it for you within a week.   Their location is nice, it is at the south end of Morrison Ranch with a view of the man-made lake, we will often take our dog for walk around the lake and then stop and sit outside. You cannot bring dogs into the store because of County health code, but there is plenty of outside patio space. Check it out!

I went here last night with a hankering for steak, and let's just say I still have a hankering.

I try not to review "angry", but I had something happen to me at Luke's yesterday that has never happened to me before. Let me begin by saying that the food at Luke's is really good, i am a semi-regular customer. The Combo sandwich is my favorite, definitely something two people can share.  We went for lunch yesterday in a group of four people. The other thing you have to know about Luke's is that it gets busy and there is not a lot of tables. We happened to look at the time as we sat down and noticed the time was 12:01pm. We ate our meals, and just as the last person was finishing the owner came and took our trays. We thought that was nice he is cleaning up for us. The he came back to the table and said "if you guys are going to loiter and talk, there is tables outside. People are waiting for your table" at which point I looked around and noticed that every body was seated at that moment. I haven't been accused of loitering since I was fifteen at the mall food court!  We got up and left, looked at the time, it was 12:19pm. WE WERE THERE FOR 18 MINUTES!!! It's not like we were going to stay much longer as we had to get back to work. I will definitely not be going back to Luke's again just based on the poor attitude the owner displayed yesterday.

Great little coffee shop right off the 101 at Via de Ventura, the staff (i think the owners) are extremely friendly and the coffee is good. I would agree with a previous poster that the coffee is not too bitter. Have tried the breakfast sandwich, the muffins and the oatmeal; all very good. Really easy to pop off the freeway, get your coffee and get right back on.

Tried to get their Prism TV service, what a fiasco. They were supposed to install the Prism and port my phone # from another provider. Install tech showed up and knew nothing of the port request, so we just proceeded with the installation of the TV service. 3 days later my internet (and TV) went down, I suspect because someone did something to the provisioning for the phone number port. I called tech support, they could not find my account, got bounced around to a couple of people till someone could finally find my account in the "AZ system" who then transferred me to tech support. Level 1 had me reboot modem, (like I hadn't already done that) and when that did not work they escalated to Tier2. The Tier 2 guy figured out there was something wrong with my account and said I needed to talk to customer service, he then blind transferred me to customer service and did not explain the problem to the rep. At this point I had been on the phone for almost two hours, I decided that I was going to cancel the service. I asked to be put back to what I had before and (DSL and DirecTV bundle) ther rep instead closed my whole account and transferred me to someone else. In the end I spent OVER 4HOURS on the phone to get my service restored (they had to create a whole new account for me) and I am not sure if my pricing will be right. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH CENTURYLINK, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL!!!!

I work near the "pony" and will go here for a cheap Prime Rib lunch once and a while. It's not bad. My complaint about this place is that nothing is fresh. I had dinner there last night and from the cellophane wrapped crackers on the table to the obviously bagged lettuce to the previously frozen mixed vegetables, nothing was fresh. The Pink Pony draws an obviously older crowd, I am in my 30's and was one of the youngest people there. This place has more of a standing as a Scottsdale landmark than a good steakhouse. The Karaoke singer guys is entertaining though.
