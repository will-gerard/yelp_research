What a great place to go. While it may be boring, I've always enjoyed coming here. Plenty to see, and it always seems to look different each time. I like the variety of exhibits that they have to offer, and some exteremly nice views, espicially during sunset. Worth a stop!

This place has been fantastic! What a perfect find. Being newer to the Valley, finding a vet I can trust that treats me and my pup right is important! From the minute I called to schedule a new patient appointment, I could tell that I was going to receive fantastic service. My wellness visit being a new patient was 1/2 off for first one, and I met with Dr. Graham. He has been a fantastic vet to have so far! I was reluctant to get my dog spayed, unsure if it was the right thing. Haven't found a place I was comfortable with the vet, and the price. Luckily if its needed, Dobson Ranch is more than happy to make payment accomidations. Never throughout my appointments have I felt pressured into things I don't need, or treated rudely if I refused certain vaccinations. Another cool thing, they set up this site called Petly, which is online and allows you to monitor all of your pets vaccinations, next appointment dates etc online. Pretty nifty. Finally made the decision to have my girl spayed. First time I've ever had a pet go through this surgery and had to deal with post-surgical care. Dr. Graham met with me about 4 days after cause I had concerns and they immediately got me in and didn't charge me extra to check up on it. Everything is going great and will be going in for the final follow-up appointment next week! Would highly recommend them for anyone!

Really good pizza. Location is nice and looks like it would be a fun place to dine in. Quick service and friendly staff. Your basic Barro's pizza not much different from all the other ones!

Like others have said here, it's fantasic. I must concur, the man at the counter is hilarious, attentive and truely cares about his customers. When I went you could just tell the true passion he puts into making sure his customers come back again and again. THIS I RESPECT!   I tried the Teriyaki Chicken, every bite the flavors just melted in my mouth. The sauce is excellent and the chicken is cooked just right. Better than ANY teriyaki chicken I have ever previously tried.   Now that I have come here, it is going to become one of my regular hotspots. I'm excited to keep trying the different menu options and  savor the equisite flavors in every mouthwatering bite.   Highly recommend this place!

Extremely friendly service, nice products and really cool things too! Was really happy with the way I was treated here. Little pricey on things but some are worth it! Especially the massage chair. Still plan on spending the $3000 to buy that thing. If anything stop in for a free massage!

For all the hype this place had from fellow Yelpers, I was excited to try out Burrito Shack. Unfortunately, my visit provided me an experience equal to that of what I would expect out of a shack. The guy who took my order was rude, rushed me, and didn't care to try to explain or recommend anything. I was here at a time when nobody else was there, so I wasn't holding up a long line or anything. To just try something, I went with the Carne Asada burrito. This is a burrito that is really hard to mess up, but somehow they managed to.   The menu is full of options, making it hard to direct anyone to what is "specialty." The building itself is pretty cool once inside though! Was cool to try out, but haven't returned since and don't plan to.

I don't know how I haven't managed to post a review of this place, seeing as I've been a member almost a year and go around 4 times a month! Never even checked in... I've gotten bad about check-ins!   Anyhow! Scottsdale Gun Club is hands down the BEST range in the Phoenix metro area. Prices are extremely reasonable, the location is nice, and the facility is top notch. The lanes are great, it is usually very well air conditioned (except when fully packed, and then it tends to get toasty with the extra body heat over the 110degrees outside...)   Only reason I am not giving 5-star, you have a 50/50 shot with the staff. By this I mean, occasionally I go in and the customer service is just HORRIBLE. Other people, are awesome. By the staff, I'm referring to the front desk/sales. Since I have been going a while, I know who to see if they're available and they really are the definition of customer service. The others who are rude, I just send it right back to them. Customer first people! I understand that there are the customers who just want to BS, but many of us, especially members, are serious shooters that expect to be treated as such. Unless you are just asking for something insane, the customer is always right! I've never complained to management, although it has crossed my mind a time or two. Lately has been a little better, so I think they are trying to weed out the bad employees as I've seen lots of new friendly faces.   Being a member really pays for itself. Generally it is 15/hr to rent the lane. One of the membership options is $29/month and you get unlimited range time. So if you went twice a month, paid for. I opted for the extra $10/month to include unlimited, yes UNLIMITED, rentals of handguns and rifles. Sorry, no fully automatics included here. However, once a year on your birthday you do get a free fully auto rental (normally $60 something) and 2 magazines of ammo. If you have never shot a full auto weapon, it is an experience everyone must try. Way too much fun for your own good! As a member you also get discounts on the ammo, and many accessories in the shop. If I buy ammo at the range depending on what they have in, for a while I was paying just under $13/box for 9mm. *This is intended for use on the range*, but nobody will stop you from taking it home if you have leftover (obviously you bought it), you just cannot buy range ammo and not go to a lane...   Attention anyone in Law Enforcement or Military, you can obtain a special "Red, White & Blue" Membership, which knocks off $5/month, plus you get a couple other perks... They also have a nice selection of firearms for LEO,Military and EMS/First Responder such as Glock Blue Label, which gets you really great pricing with your active ID.   Also every membership you get 6 free guest passes a year. Not a bad gig.   I live almost 20 miles away from here, but really close to C2 Tactical or Caswell's. I was nothing but disappointed at both of those establishments, and make the drive to come to Scottsdale.    My favorite part, many of the Range Masters are extremely nice. Obviously you'll find the "all that" ones, but for the most part they have an incredible amount of knowledge to offer you. They are all volunteers, many are NRA Instructors. I personally have been able to improve my skills two-fold from advice from them, for FREE :) This advice could make all the difference if you ever were faced with a situation we all hope never happens.   They also offer a TON of classes for anyone interested such as: self defense, CCW, Youth safety, women's defense, handgun retention/disarming etc. Really you have the opportunity to learn a great bit, and if you are going to own firearms you have the responsibility to properly know as much as you can about them.   Overall, this is a great place to go if you like to shoot guns. I miss living in a rural area where you could go shooting in my backyard, but this is as best as I can get living in a major city where it would take hours to get to any good shooting places, not to mention the heat! I also recommend anyone that is remotely interested in firearms but has never shot them to come here, rent a gun and try it out. Even better, take one of the classes so you can be safe as possible.   Have fun!    P.S.- I'd love to even get to spend an hour in that Titanium Lounge. Unfortunately they have a membership limit, and its thousands of dollars to buy one and quite expensive per month, but looks so nice.

Fun place to go on Thursdays when you can get the unlimited game card from I believe 6-10. Plus it's 18+ after 6pm so it's a really fun place to go, grab some drinks at the upstairs bar and play video arcade games drunk. Amazing what that little bit of alcohol does to your innerchild. Overall a fun place to go if you're looking for something cheap and a good time. Not quite as good as Dave and Busters but fun anyway.

Recently purchased a new Acura from Acura of Tempe. From the minute I spoke with the salesman, to signing my paperwork and driving the car home, the experience was extraordinary. Never felt pressured by the sales staff or manager. The manager Joel is absolutely fantastic and will work with you 100%. Was never pressured for a credit app immediately and was given real numbers on what I can expect to actually pay. Dealership is also very clean and they have quite a selection of snacks and beverages. Grew up with family in car business and have purchased a few myself and without a doubt this was the most pleasant experience I've had.

Typical panda. All the food looks so amazing and then you get it home and its just Eh. Could do worse with a quick meal, but I always leave feeling so dissatisfied with the food. Service was quick and friendly, so no complaints at all with staff. But unfortunately service is only part of the picture, and pushing $10 for lunch I have higher expectations.

Blah. Not the best Walmart around. I only go for Location but I've been to plenty better. Some of the staff at this location aren't exactly the brightest or the friendliest compared to other walmart stores in the valley. Wait times can be absolutely ridiculous even late at night. Store could be kept up much nicer if any effort was put in at all, right now it looks like they hired a bunch of 12 year old boys to clean it. Messy. May be due to understaffing and I get that one person cannot keep up with a 24 hr store of that size. My advice pick a different walmart to go to or another store. I minimize my trips here to simply little things.

Salsa is outstanding. Same with the tortillas. Would've given full 5-stars, but was disappointed in the Huevos Rancheros I got. I hope to go back soon and try more of their delicious looking menu items! This is truely Mexican food, which I appreciate.

The guys at this pool store have been great. Pool recently turned into a nightmare when pool pump broke, then balance threw off, then pool turned into a swamp. Even having a pool guy (needless to say no longer my pool guy, doing work myself) the pool got worse. Stopped into A&M Corsons where Blayr helped me out. Recommended a bunch of different actions we could take, chemicals, parts etc. Pool pump is working better than ever, auto cleaner is working great and he was able to help get my pool back to super clean and clear within a couple of days. Been appreciative of his knowledge and advice. Nice to go to a retail store where the folks behind the desk understand the products they are selling. Highly recommend going here over Leslie's.

Amazing Tacos. Hands down the original fish taco brings a taste of Mexico right to your plate. Who can resist Taco Tuesdays either?? Cheap tacos, high quality. Every reciept offers you a free drink with next purchase as well, so win win right? If you haven't checked out Rubio's, it is worth a stop.

Always really friendly staff, easy to slip in and out with items you need. Location is perfect for me. I can't really say too much about it after all it is just a Sam's Club. Love how you can go on the sample days and pretty much eat lunch during your shopping trip!! I believe thursdays and fridays? Anyhow, store is clean too, clean stores always earn a bonus star. Staff isn't too pushy like some clubs about their stupid premium membership, and this I appreciate. I don't want to be asked 100X even after saying no. This club gets that. Overall a good club.

Just joined this gym the past week and so far it has been great! First walked in and was greated by a very courteous and friendly staff. Inquiring about membership, they quickly called for a membership guide to come over. He gave us an extensive tour of the facilities and what it had to offer. 24 hour a day access is really perfect for people who shift work like I do. The two swimming pools are great. During summer basically works out to one for kids and one for the adults. Very nice locker rooms and the whole club has an upscale feel to it. Resonable prices for the ammenities the club has to offer. Upon joining recieved coupons to the spa and got a half-off massage. Rather tasty healthy restaurant inside as well. Even during peak-hours you can find equipment here. Glad to find this awesome place!!

Came here for the yearly Endless shrimp. Being a sea food fanatic, all you can eat savory shrimp for one low price, how can you go wrong? The staff was very friendly and we were promptly seated. Didn't take them very long to have the waitress over and before you knew it, food and drinks were on our table. Overall this was an enjoyable meal and a nice red lobster!

Overall a pretty decent place for sushi. Not the best sushi I have ever tasted, not the worst either. Nice atmosphere and the staff was pretty friendly. Tried to come here for happy hour once but was disappointed to find out it was only outside. Not worth the extra couple bucks in my pocket especially since it was 115. Came back again though and sat at the sushi bar next to the huge fish tank. Pretty cool place to go, would like to try it again with a different chef many people seemed to be asking for at the bar. Would like to try Reverse HH too.

Absolutely an amazing place to eat. Unfortunately for me its right around the corner and its a bit pricier than your average hot dog! Come here multiple times a week cause the food is amazing. Worth a drive out of your way just to try one of these! My current favorite is the Shane Doan dog, little different in terms of ingredients but man what a combination. This restaurant is hidden inside an antique shop right off of Arizona ave near Warner. They prefer cash if you have it, but also use Square. Hours are limited but go between 11-3 and most days you should be safe! Happy eating!!

Still giving Pittsburgh Willy's the top score. Everytime I go here you get treated like family! I'm always forgetting to check-in at my yelp locations. Especially this one. Even though I get free things it slips my mind!! Randy is really a great owner and is extremely personable. Wish I could brag for days how awesome this place is. Always recommend it here. Always.

Being a coffee-aholic, this place sure satisfies the craving! Had an absolutely delicious drink! Nice comfortable area to lounge in, extremely friendly staff too! It's a bit out of the way for me thought. The only beef is I believe the coffee is just a bit overpriced. Otherwise it's fantastic!

Who can hate a delicious In-N-Out. Anything less than 5 stars would be insane. My favorite meal is a 4x4 with peppers inside, fries well done and a vanilla shake. Extra spread to go with burger and you have perfection!

Went back on the 72 hour rain guarantee, service was much better. The guy washing the car took so much care and detail, even on a free wash. Left my car looking 10X better than the wash I paid for, and I even left a good tip. Takes a lot to get me to leave more than a couple bucks. Will try again with full service when they wash interior as well. Hoping I can get this place to 5-star! Mind you my interior is never that dirty, my car only has 2500 miles so this shouldn't be a difficult task.

Bought groupon for 3 Big Kahuna washes. Really impressed with how quick and excellent a job they did. Thorough vacuuming and wipe down. They left my car looking amazing. Even with 6000 miles of I-17 since my last wash, they got all the bugs off! Only issue is the waiting area and cashier. Its hot, not very comfortable seating and you have no way to watch for when your car is done unless you stand outside. Staff was decently friendly, but don't expect top notch. The quality of the work makes up for the staff in my opinion. I would recommend, especially if you purchase the groupon.

Worst Dunkin donuts in existence. Tried it 3 times now and each time rude staff, drinks not worth me paying a penny for, and the donuts aren't anywhere near the same tasting as the rest of the locations. I'd be scared to know health department score for this establishment, because I've gotten sick everytime. If it weren't for the location, I never would've gone back after try one. I assure you I'll never go back at all ever. Corporate dunkin needs to look into this location because the quality and service ruins the entire business' reputation. DON'T GO HERE!

Decided to try this place after seeing the Groupon the had. Bought two incase I liked it. Turned out it was the best decision ever! Would've been so angry had I just bought one. My massage therapist was named Sarah. Normally when I asked for deep tissue I am extremely disappointed and don't feel like I got my money's worth. For the first time ever, I left a massage feeling relax, healed and tension gone. She know's her stuff!! (very hard to make appointment so that says something). So glad I was able to find her here. Signed up for a membership (never done that before) and am looking forward to getting regular massages. The facility is also clean and the rooms are relaxing and nice. Would recommend trying, especially with all the offers they have right now.

As far as Verizon wireless stores go, I liked this one. wasn't overwhelmingly busy with stupid reasons like some stores i have been too. all the staff was  knowledgeable and friendly. They were able to help me discuss all my options. While Verizon as a whole has issues and policies I hate, the individual store is great. They tried to find everyway to save me any money and didn't show me devices I clearly didn't want, just ones I liked. Great sales staff, that is how it should be done. Not too pushy it was just right.

Every Dutch Bros is amazing! I make at least once daily stop at this location, sometimes twice. Staff is super friendly and they make delicious coffee. On my daring days (Nights when i go to work with almost no sleep) Dutch Bros offers up their E.R 911. 6 shots of espresso to kick start your body. Besides that, daily happy hours in the afternoon offer great deals on drinks. My favorite is $3 Dutch Freezes. When its triple digits this is a nice relaxing treat. They allow you to add in any flavor you'd like. Currently I like their Mocha Mint Dutch Freeze. If I don't go here for the coffee, I'd go just to see the staff. No other business are people this friendly. Even if you've never met someone, they always try to have a conversation and want to make your experience great. Highly recommend!

Normal Dutch bros!! Not quite the same as my trusty McQueen Dutch bros but these guys still rock!! Love the coffee and other drinks. Super friendly staff and they always great you with a smile! I'd be fine with making this my daily stop if it was my neighborhood. Try some of the blended drinks! You can always ask for sugar free, caffeine free and fat free if you want!! Happy Coffee days!

I used Sweettouch last fall after monsoon season. Having two large dogs, a big yard, a pool and then areas of dirt, it is safe to say that my light colored carpet sure took a beating. I called Sweettouch after purchasing a Groupon (some places normally treat you differently when using coupons) and they were extremely professional and treated me very well.   One of the most frustrating things when hiring people to come to your house is the "I'll be there between 10am and 5pm". I was fortunate to not have this experience with Sweettouch! They gave me a time that they would be at my house, and arrived when they said they would. This is one of the most important things in my opinion.   After letting the crew into my home, they were highly professional and respectful. They didn't try to "upsell" me like some companies do, and my carpets turned out amazing. I plan to use them again within the next week here as I've moved out, and I recommend them to anyone who is searching for carpet cleaners as these guys are the best!

Overall I have been rather happy with this place. Have ordered for delivery a couple times and the food was always prompt, hot and as ordered. The pricing is very reasonable, and the food actually quite good for a $6 lunch. Minimum of $15 on all delivery orders FYI. I personally always enjoy  a good chow mein and they make one well.  Glad to have a place so close to my house to deliver that craving of Chinese when I want!

I've ordered online for delivery quite a few times from this location, and like all Jimmy John's I was not at all disappointed. Arrived quickly to my house, smile on the delivery person's face and sandwich was delicious. Best part, there isn't an insane delivery charge for your stuff. The actual building is nice too the one time I went in. Friendly staff. Would recommend this location as well as Jimmy John's in general. Subway has nothing on Jimmy John's!

I personally hate wasting my time. Was recommended this company to use for a major irrigation issue I have right now. After waiting a while to call when I noticed water building under my walkway, I finally decided to make a call last week. I was told by the man who answered the phone, that on Friday he would be out to look at the issue and get me a quote to repair it. I decided to wait the couple days for them to come look, and come friday I never saw them or got a call estimating work. Still haven't heard from them since, and given it is now Tuesday, I'm hoping to get a call but this seems unlikely. I will be looking for another company as a $195 water bill is rediculous and I need this repaired soon. This is no way for a company to do business and I will be taking mine elsewhere that respects my time and urgency.

What a great store! Had a decent selection at excellent prices. This is the way a gun shop should be. I thank Mr. Healy for opening such a fantastic store. Due to him being a former LEO, he understands what people want and need, and still keeps his prices fair to the times. His business model is fantastic and I was treated with respect. Plus, you're allowed to carry your firearm loaded and all.

This was an exceptional good meal. Came here based off fantastic Yelp reviews and Yelpers didn't disappoint! I love the atmosphere and cook it yourself at the table. Ordered a few different things for table and had a blast. Everything was amazing. Cheese wontons and their sweet & sour was out of this world!   Tried the chicken, beef, bacon asparagus. Fantastic. Worth a stop here if you're in the area.

This is by far the worst gun range I have ever been to. If I'm going somewhere to exercise my second ammendment rights, why am I asked to unload my weapons completely? I can understand all the ones I'm bringing in to shoot, but my primary sidearm, holstered in a  retention Holster and only under my control is wrong. Why do the employees of C2 have anymore right to defend their lives than I do? Stopped in to test out my new Glock I had just bought since the location was convenient, brought along a friend and went inside. We were helped by a staff member named Colin. Completely rude. I don't want to be treated like a criminal who is going to shoot them having my every move watched like a Hawk. I had respected the sign on the door and completely unloaded our weapons and we had followed everything to the tee. By the time I was done getting my lane and getting through Mr Scrutiny, I had no desire to shoot anymore nor was it even an enjoyable experience. The range officer was the one personable individual that I had spoken with, and he was there with live rounds and wasn't a controlling ass like Colin and respected our ability to handle our firearms. Moral of the story in my mind is if I was there to hurt anyone, I would've already done it. So give me the right to carry my gun, don't look at your customers like criminals and maybe I'd consider spending more of my money here. Until then I would never recommend this place to ANYONE who actually believes in their right to carry. I'm making it my mission to try to get the information out to all those in the gun community to just let this place die. Why is it that you can take your firearms into Walmart, out to eat, into gas stations etc, but not a gun range? I know some reviews are good on here and I have to admit the facilities are very nice, hence the 1 star since that is all C2 tactical has going for them. I sincerely hope that the management of this location takes a hard look at some of their business practices before this gets on too many people's boycott list. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. (Not like it's cheap here anyway)
