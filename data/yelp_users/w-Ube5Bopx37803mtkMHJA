Horrible place. Very nice girls but the vet needs to be fired. My dogs cut is extremely jagged and is red and puffy and he's been screaming non stop. Never had any issues ever with all my other dogs at the vet. It's not worth saving a few hundred dollars. I feel bad for going the cheap route. Neuter/spay sweat shop :(

Absolutely love this place!!! Great fast food room service. Everyone who works here is super cool. I brought my 2 chihuahuas and everyone is so friendly to them. The pool on Sunday's is amazing perfectly relaxing with great music!! I could live here and not leave ever with the pool, gym, sushi. W hotels are the way to go!!

Tonites show was my first time here and it was amazing!! The staff and owner who did some stand up was so funny kind and cool. The staff was great and good food and drinks. The comediennes were so funny I was laughing crying so hard. This place was hands-down the best comedy club I've been to and I will be back very soon.

Best moving company EVER!!!   Amazing honest fast crew. I used these guys 2 years ago and they moved me so fast so I kept there card for next time. 2 years later I'm moving go Laguna California and got an amazing quote. They quote you on items not per hour. They gave me a time frame of 630-930 4 days b4 my move. Then the night before they said 730am. They arrived at 7am. They loaded up for 90 min making sure everything was wrapped tight and even made sure my expensive painting was sealed correctly. Tim the owner is super cool and comes to every move to make sure all is correct for the delivery of stuff. Theh even offered to bag my mattress so it wouldn't get dirty. They loaded up the truck and met me an hour after me in California so I didn't have to wait next day for my stuff. The guys are cool, hard working and VERY gentle with your stuff. I'll never use another mover again.

I don't even want to post 1 star but no choice. Saturday night was my moving away party I had a table reserved for 2 weeks. I got there at 1030 with 2 girls to start and the door guys were rude questioning me if it was my table I guess it's rare girls book a table then I got walked to a table that wasn't worth the amount of bottles I said I'd pay for then it was an argument back and forth with the manager. He shouldn't have been arguing with me #1 very unprofessional and I was the second table in the place. Then he finally agreed to move me tables and we waited close to 30 minutes for a waitress to come by. When she finally did come by it was few and far between throughout the night me and my party ended up pouring our own drinks majority of the night. After a $1400 tab I should've been well taken care of. Everybody who works there was rude and did not care about the customers. The next day I check my bank account to make sure everything was correct and they even charge my card twice. This place is a joke do not waste your time there is a ton of other bars in the area where you will be treated better. Very unfortunate considering it was my last night in this town. No one has still yet called me about the double charge on my card 2 days later and I have already reached out to two different people that I was friends with that worked at the club. Sayonara Mint Scottsdale. Horrible experience. I'll be posting this review on my website and blog as well wait too much money to be spending not to be satisfied in the slightest.

Paul was absolutely amazing. my seven month old Jeep was in a bad car accident and he fixed it back like nothing ever happened in a quality time schedule and was so honest reliable and I will definitely recommend the shop to all of my family and friends. One of the adjusters tried giving a certain amount to be fixed and Paul had found other problems with the vehicle after parts came off and had the adjuster pay out more money definitely the best shop in the valley with the best service.

WORST PLACE!!!!! First I come into the office and I'm called into a room then the lady starts calling me another name. You come in and say "thats Erica" as the lady isn't even on MY file. Then I get up walk to another room as instructed and another lady does my injection when I specified you for my appt on the phone. She asked me if I wanted numbing cream AFTER she started the injections then no offer of ice or the zinc sitting on counter after the injection. I never bruise and it was so bad for 7 days! I was asked about it at board meetings and out and about and nothing would hide it. I took arnica b4 the lady was new and did not know what she was doing. Ghetto place and people. They need to be closed down.

Absolutely love Amida and her work. She's so precise and dedicated to the perfection of her clients lashes. She's always on time and so fast. I saw 9 lash ladies before her and had so many real lashes break off. She knows what she's doing and I won't go anywhere else. She plays relaxing music and has a nice studio easy to find. Definitely go to her the prices are great and the work is fabulous

Amazing pho and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone says it's a weird atmosphere but I love it because it's different, it's jazz music in a bar atmosphere with amazing food you can't go wrong here.
