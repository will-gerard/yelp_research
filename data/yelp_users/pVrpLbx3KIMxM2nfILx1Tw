It's a casino and it's not in Vegas so you shouldn't have high expectations. It's not as "classy" as Talking Stick but it's less crowded which I enjoy because I hate waiting for a spot on the roulette machine or at a blackjack table. I would give it 5 stars but they do not have a poker room which is my game of choice.

This place is what it is! It looks very sketchy on the outside (and the inside too) but its a great place to play pool and have a cheap beer. I would not recommend bringing any of your ASU bro friends here (if you have any?) but other than that I like the overall feel to this place. Just dont act like a D-bag and everything will be fine.

This location stated that they were too busy for deliveries and suggested a try one of their competitors... Really?

So the place looks super sketch from the outside and the staff could care less about you as a human BUT not gonna lie, the food is pretty, pretty, pretty good. I always get chicken tacos with rice beans and make sure you get the red and green sauce

Who doesn't love old random mid-century crap as far as they eye can see? You will get lost in this place. 98% of it is stuff you will not want to buy BUT odds are there will be some sort of hidden gem that will tickle your fancy. I go here sometimes just to kill time. Going to buy art and other random hoo haa here.

Pretty much either my favorite or 2nd favorite place to get a sandwich in Scottsdale. Not to mention you can get a 12 inch sandwich for less than 10 bucks. Place gets packed so make sure you order ahead

My fav high class restaurant in Scottsdale. By far the best service I have ever had in old town. I never get dessert except when I come here. Great place to take a date if you are trying to show off (wink face). Love the very dim lighting.

Fight broke out but thats to be expected. Played Giant Jenga and Corn Hole (or bags for you posers). Drinks were tasty and really enjoyed the inside. Love the patio as well.

Probably my favorite dentist of all time! Makes you feel comfortable at all times and love the ceiling TVs that you can watch while they go to work. Just understand they are always busy so if you have to cancel you won't be able to get in for a while.

I had never had fro yo before (like this) and I am officially addicted. Great flavors and great topping selection. I literally think they have 1 employee working at a time, who's only job is to tell you how fat you are by weighing how much your fro yo is going to be. I spend at least 6 bucks every time.

I literally hate this place because their donut holes are so delicious and addicting! I moved into an apartment down the street and now I have to drive by it everyday... Haunting my dreams with delicious donuts

You 100% are paying for location if you are living at Colonial Grand Old Town Scottsdale South. One of the staff members is really friendly but the others are not The apartment I lived in looked liked it was straight out of 1995.

Loved it, friendly staff and food was d-lish and adorable. People who rated this place poorly probably are afraid to sit next to people they don't know and are easily offended. You are at a comedy club! Shut up and go watch Netflix at home with your cat.

My new go to spot to bring the pooch. Great atmosphere both inside and out. Really fast service and decent prices. Not a big fan of the valet thing but hey it's at a lot of places these days. Free dog treats and water bowls.

My fav place in Scottsdale. This is where I play all my poker. 47 or more tables so waiting does not take that long, TVs everywhere, fast chip and food service. Amazing dealers. Can't say enough about this place. Splash pots!

Quick and easy. Came in, said my screen was broke, he said give him 10 mins, 10 mins go by, iPhone fixed. Done and Done! This is how it should be! Not going to Verizon and waiting an hour to have someone try and sell you stuff you don't want when you only came in to fix a problem.

Just moved in and love this place. Moved out of my old lame apartment and I feel better as a human! Ashley is amazing to work with. AMAZING customer service. I would recommend this place to anyone moving to the area or looking for a new place to call home!

Best sandwich my parents have ever had in Arizona. Place has a ton of sandwiches and there is no way you walk away hungry from this joint.

Best of the best. Guys have style inside and out. Both are funny as hell and you're guaranteed a good laugh (and haircut). Guys have no problem giving advice and being direct if your haircut game is messed up. If you are looking for something basic where the person giving you a haircut is a minimum wage zombie, head on over to Great Clips or Super Cuts. Make sure to give these guys daps before you leave.

Great alternative from RnR for bottomless mimosas  and bloody Mary's on Sunday's. Food is a bit over priced but what do you expect from Scottsdale. Much more low key and sometimes a dude with high white socks plays Eric Clapton tunes. Mos def would come back!

If Siskle and Ebert were still alive they would give this place two thumbs up. Great atmosphere and beers on tap. Not to mention they have old school games at each table so you can challenge your friends (or date) to a game of Paperboy.

Tacos are good. They have a carousel of random sauces to choose from to enhance your taco/nacho experience. This place is very hip right now.

Over priced for my taste but the pie was pretty, pretty good. You can mos def eat an entire carne pizza to yourself. They have great beer options and don't serve bud light (AMAZING!). Not my fav local pizza joint but better than most main stream chains, just gotta be willing to dish out the cash.

I have no idea why I did not find this place sooner. Great for an alternative. Beats going to your typical Old Town bars who compete against one another. Atmosphere on point. Really wish I could gamble here!

Worst of the worst. The number of problems I have had with these guys literally started on day 1. Here are of the few things that have happened since I moved in:  1. No cable or internet for over a month. Apartment was remodeled but they destroyed all wires so cable installation and construction took over 1 month.  2. Roof rats came into my apartment multiple times.  3. They never call you back and they never do what they say.

Really like the concept of this place. Cheap (or what I would call cheap) personal pizzas for about 8 bucks and unlimited toppings. Staff is always super friendly and pizza tastes great.

Edgar is the man! Literally was heartbroken when I heard he left his last place, but was thrilled to find out he opened up The Manner. I am moving to SF and when I come back to visit Scottsdale, a cut from Edgar will always be on my MUST DO list. I would recommend him to anyone. Make sure you book in advance!
