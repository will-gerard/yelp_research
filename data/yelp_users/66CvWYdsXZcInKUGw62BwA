I grew up on this Macayo's location's food, literally. My grandmother moved to Arizona in 1942 and was excited when this place opened. So my family has been coming here for 50+ years. Is it the best Mexican food ever in Phoenix? No, it's not "foodie" food. Do they serve a great chimi? Yup. Enchilada sampler is good too. Chips and salsa always good and it's dining room is family friendly, if kitchy and dated. Love it or leave it, Macayo's is a landmark to Phoenicians.

Five star for the experience and the amazing organ player who apparently knows every song in the world by memory! Pizza is better than a Peter Piperish place, but that's definitely not why you go. The organ is amazing and the kids love it. The history of it is pretty cool too!

The aroma as I stepped out of the car was enticing. The atmosphere of the shop is exactly what one would hope for in a small town, natural pork shop. Samples on the counter were yummy and a nice way to try something new. Selection was great. I picked up two end pork loins to make homemade pulled pork, a frozen rolled loin for later, maple sausage for breakfast tomorrow and piggy ears for my dog - whose disappearance means they are good and he doesn't want to share. Glad they had the buns I forgot at the grocery store and the green chili burrito is as good as they say. All being said, I walked out for all this at $50, which was a little high - but for natural pork which is IMPOSSIBLE to find, I paid it. I hate the "solution of phosphates", blah blah blah added to grocery pork. I was surprised the burrito was $4.50 when I looked at the receipt at home. Still, good food, great service and supporting a local business is worth it!

It's pricier than supercuts or great clips, but they're kid friendly and we always get a super cut from Kristi. My daughter loves the princess station!

I love this place and don't make it due to location nearly enough. From delicious shawarma with loads of garlic sauce (oh yeah, I smell but I'm happy) to gyros. My favorite is the homemade baklava.

I'm a regular for their meatball subs with sweet potato fries and aioli. So much so I'm beginning to look like a meatball! I wish the kids meal was a little more extensive. They do give the kids dough to play with and they'll bake it for them too. Picky as my husband is, he didn't like the pizza, which I know is sacrilege for some, but he's a pizza snob. He does like the Italian sub and said the Italian sausage was "wonderful" a little sweet and a little spicy, made fresh daily. If it can please that persnickety guy who eats sausage a minimum of once a week, must be good. So, a little something for everyone. Tip: order the junior size, neither of us has ever been able to even finish that! And the salads I've seen could feed four. Enjoy!

This is the Mexican food I crave when I am traveling away from home. Chile relleno is great. Homemade bean dip and Jorge is the best most attentive waiter. On Thursdays they have live music that is fun and family friendly. We go at least once a week. True devotees.

Love this place for local, easy Mexican. We always ask for Jorge, whose fun and attentive. I'm a lover of chile relleno and their enchiladas. Being a zonie my whole life, I eat Mexican - well, a lot. Each place has it's specialty and for Serranos it's the relleno. It's a little hot, so prepare with a Patron margarita. Or three. Ah, the good life!

Queen Creek living is the Life...I have lived in the Valley for most of my 35 years and this is the best place I have been, West side, East Side and South Side...it's got that small town feel, you know your neighbors and the scenery is still somewhat rural...  The worst part = school choices are limited for the discerning parent, but schlep into Chandler for private school and enjoy the quiet life in the "country" the rest of the time.

My last viewing of Cats was 20 years ago at Gammage and while you can't "memory compare" - the cast and crew of this production helped create a nice "memory".  The food was about what one would expect for dinner theatre, i.e. the prime rib was well seasoned and served with flavorful horseradish sauce. The side dishes not so much. They offer additonal add ons to dinner at added prices. These were better than the dinner, including shrimp cocktail and cheesecake for desert, which had a sharp rum glaze. Cocktails are available before seating which was relaxing in a nice sitting area. Ticket and wait staff were friendly and helpful.   A great experience overall. Would be good for a date night or mom's night out.

5 stars for a deli? When it's this good oh yeah! Great Cuban, great roast beef horseradish but the amazing part was the pancetta wrapped homemade mozzarella and carrot cake. Lemon bar was just a lemon bar but the cake was better than my grandma's and she was a cook for 30 years. Farmers market out front and the service, while hit or miss by whoever was walking by, still slipped my kid a cookie on the way out gratis. We'll be back!

A new menu, tried the steak, onion panini with horseradish. Pretty good but a little overcooked. However, they found a zillion ways to mess up my kid's meal. I asked for a salad instead of the yogurt, seemed simple enough of a request. They made a huge salad, enough that I said "Is that what goes with the kids meal to replace the yogurt or fruit?" got to the counter, paid and noticed that they charged me for a regular salad, then for a kid drink which used to be included, then for a kid's meal. Got the manager, explained the failure to communicate and he refunded the salad price. My daughter jokingly said "as long as they didn't forget my cookie". See she wasn't concerned about the vegetable to carb ratio or the dairy problem. Then the lady behind the counter slips me a cookie all clandestine-like. We sit down and I unpack the bag to discover they gave us a whole sandwich instead of the 1/2 for a kids meal, no biggie but a waste and not what the menu said, then they gave us fruit and yogurt. She had slipped us the cookie because apparently she realized they had the WHOLE order wrong. For kids that can't have dairy, a salad or fruit substitute shouldn't be rocket science. Everything else was classic Paradise and the manager made it right, but it was a hassle, a waste of time and food.

The worst hostesses (your going to try and put a six year old in the bar??), compounded with surly and inattentive waiter + food not on par with their other locations. Big disappointment. This won't be a stop for us in the future and that stinks because I was so excited Arriba's opened a location on my side of town. I had the white sands chimi which has always been good, but there was no pork to the chili. Rice was like it was leftover and when my bean burrito loving little one wouldn't eat the "yucky tortilla and spicy beans", we were out.

Fajita were ok but the pizza was terrible. Atmosphere is good and they try, food just isn't spectacular.

Cheap Chinese done right. No MSG. Orders always correct. Best $8 you'll spend for food in Queen Creek. I always have Cashew Chicken, hubs opts for Orange Chicken or Sweet and Sour. Daughter goes for low mein. All this equals a happy family meal for $24 including appetizer and soup. Sweet!

I know, five stars for takeout? But cheap delish Chinese food. We have the cashew chicken, orange chicken, sweet and sour, egg drop and low mein. So, we're not original, but hey, yummy!

My car was clean! That in itself is amazing since they have to get through kid debris and dog fur.

Why rate a drive thru? Because they always get my order right, they are always super nice and efficient. Real chicken nuggets and breast, not the creepy McDonald nugget mystery meat. And try a peach shake. Heaven!

You can't beat the after school $1 kids cones Mon - Thu, the always happy service and classically good, not overpriced ice cream

Peach soda, fresh salt water taffy and real rootbeer...FRESH and authentic, all natural selection of sodas to counteract the very unnatural but very delish selection of candies old and new.

Olive Garden has lost it's luster. The good things on the menu, manicotti and the braised ribs with risotto are gone. The low fat pasta was just noodles and tomatoes, no seasonings to speak of. The only reason to go is salad. Otherwise, just another tired chain. Better to eat local business

Ordered a cake for a special occasion. Owner was pleasant, gave my daughter a free cookie and free samples for me. Can't wait to see how it turns out!
