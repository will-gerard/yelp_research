Had exactly what I needed and even though there was a really long line. The ladies came through the line with waters and fun samples of new products!

Terrible customer service! We were running all around town the week of our wedding and needed to pick up some shoes there for the wedding. Called asked if they could hold them for us over night just until the morning and wouldn't do it for us. We had to make a special trip down there when we were gonna be in the area the next morning! Really disappointed Foot Locker.

Extremely slow service, no sense of urgency even with a line out the door. Seems like they have a lot of new people that don't know what they are doing. Super frustrating experience!! Also bathroom was a huge mess.

Top Golf is super fun! Loved it! Great vibe and good drinks. There is tons of parking. Tons of games to play while you wait for your spot. The food was ok that is really the only thing that they could improve!  I can't wait to go back!
