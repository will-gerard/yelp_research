Larry Lesser is a great property manager! His professional service and expertise in the industry are unsurpassed. I have happily referred several clients to Larry and will continue to do so in the future. Larry is a shining star in the world of property management. Other property management companies could learn from his quality of service and knowledge.

I just don't understand why car salesmen have to be so dishonest. I was working with a salesman at this location for about 2 weeks getting the deal negotiated over the phone to save time when I came in to sign the paperwork. I arrived early for our appointment ready to purchase the vehicle we had spoken about that day. I was very disappointed when the salesman I had been working with the entire time turned out to be just another liar. I had thought that we were working together and it turned out he was just trying to screw me like everyone else. Very disappointed. Don't go to this location to buy a Honda. I got an even better deal on the same vehicle with much less hassle at Superstition Honda in Mesa.
