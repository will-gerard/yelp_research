Its a really nice place. This bad experience is partly our fault for showing up 5 minutes before closing. We were not planning on buying that day. The service was ok but rushed and told us to come back as they were closing. I understood but when you are talking about a high end purchase you would think they wouldnt rush you out the door. Well we went to Jared who was open until 10pm. Again we were not planning on purchasing. However the service was so great and they helped us find the perfect ring that we made the purchase. I wonder if they know we were that ready to buy if they would have rushed us out the door.

We came in to just shop and get an idea of what we were looking for. My father has decided to upgrade my mothers engagement ring this Xmas. We were greeted at the door by Zeke. He introduced us to Nathalie. They both were very helpful and not pushy. They helped us find the perfect ring and diamond. Even though we were not planning, they did such a great job that we just had to buy it. Thanks Zeke and Nathalie! I would highly recommend!

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Techs are not trained. They only fix the quick easy fixes... anything difficult they will have trouble with. Go to a bigger service company. Owner is unprofessional and will not make things right when they make a mistake.

Vicky and her team did a great job! I took my 2005 Cadillac that was backed into in a parking lot. Lovetts was recommended by my state farm agent. They offer rental car service right there! They fixed it quickly and the job was superb! I would highly recommend!

Great food and fast service. Wish the portions were smaller at times but for others that may be a plus.

I had two vehicles repaired here. I had issues with both. We had our service van in and it took over 3 months to fix. After it was ready... the van had damage that wasn't there when we took it ! I had to prove to Midway based on pictures that they caused the damage. They finally agreed to fix it. Secondly my personal car had the bumper replaced and painted. 6 months later I get backed into and the paint cracks and chips off. Obvisouly I knew that damage came from someone backing into me. However I took it for repair at another shop and they told me the paint should not be cracking like that. That they did not prep the bumper correctly. I had to replace the bumper again. With both of these issues the service was awful and I will never go back. I worked with Larry Davis. He was all smiles until I had issues. After that he wouldn't even come out of his office.

Brought a bunch of Samsung tab 3 and 4 for repair options. We use a lot of these at work. They were very knowledgeable and honest. We were able to repair way more tablets at a fair price. Highly recommended!

Luis has done several jobs for us at Del Sol Furniture and we are very happy with his work. He is fast, same day if you need it. He is knowledgeable and honest. We plan on using ASAP for all of our properties. Keep up the good work Luis!

The food is great and all day happy hour on Sunday is great during football season! The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the service is hit or miss. However the food is worth it. Kobe burger and sweet potato fries are the best!

Went to add a phone with the jump on demand lease option. The staff told me that T-Mobile no longer offers jump on demand. I almost believed them but I looked it up and was still on tmobiles website. I told them it was still on tmobiles website. They said they just don't do it on store anymore. Hmmmm   Called customer care from the store and they told me that they should be able to do the jump on demand. Finally after getting the run around and having to call the manager since there was no manager on duty. They magically figured out how to get me jump on demand. Save yourself a headache and go to another T-Mobile store.
