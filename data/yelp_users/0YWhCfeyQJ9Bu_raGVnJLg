Super interesting tour. Do NOT go during Summer - we went in December and it was a perfect weather day for a visit. The tour guide was knowledgable and sweet.

I have seen a lot of Cirque shows..I love them (though there was one - I don't remember which one - that I wasn't as crazy about it- I wanna say it was about clowns (which would likely explain it, I hate clowns)  This is a sexy show - definitely not something you want to see with a parent or your kid, or on a date (if you aren't sure if you like the person yet.)  I really loved it - lots of topless girls and hunky men doing all sorts of suggestive things. This could only work in Las Vegas, so really the perfect show to see if you want a "classy" but only-in-Vegas-type experience.  We got discounted tickets for a Saturday show at one of the  1/2 price ticket vendors, there were plenty of empty seats on a Saturday night, so don't pay full price.

What NY'er (or in my case ex-Ny'er) does not have Rao's on their bucket list?? I had fantasies of trying to figure out a way to get in when I lived there - but never had the balls to go there and be rejected.  Fear not my little kittie-cats, Rao's is now available to the general public via Las Vegas!!!!  It was the only reservation I made prior to my weekend in Vegas, I wasn't sure about whether it would be crowded or not - but I was taking NO chances.  This is OLD school Italian food. I swear when you live in a city like SF these kinds of joints are becoming more and more difficult to find. - Just classic red sauce-y meat-y cheesy Italian food.  I know that the chicken scarpiello is supposed to be great here - but unfortunately I had made that very dish for Easter the weekend before - and we had been eating leftovers all week, so I was not in the mood (sadly).  I went with two food-loving girlfriends and we went family-style.  Night one we ordered: -Mozzarella en carozza - this is rarely found on menus outside of NY, and even then it is rare -Meatballs - a must! -Chicken Milanese - oh the crust was divine! (we asked, they said semolina flour, hmmmm...) -Fettuccini w cream peas and prosciutto -Peanut butter cream cheese pie thing - freaking amazing - get it, even if you might not finish it, but you will find a way...  We found ourselves with no plans on our last night - so went there (again). - Sunday night 2 of us split - and ate at the bar - the service was not so great - we were guessing the guy was new- everytime someone ordered a bottle or a glass of wine around us - he asked them to tell him the vin number -Chicken parmesan - very good - but I preferred the Milanese -(pasta) Begger purses with fried sage and cranberries, really good!  It is pricy - but I think every nice meal in Vegas is pricy. I would definitely go back.

My old friend is a host here at Bally's - If you are a gambler and want VIP service ask for James Brattoli. He is a great and fun guy who definitely will take care of you.  We had booked a room through Expedia, but he made sure we got a nice view and upgraded us to VIP check in. He also helped up make a few restaurant reservations.  Bally's is not one of the higher end hotels on the strip, but it is clean, is centrally located and has nice views and a pretty pool area (James said the pool at the Paris hotel is better with afternoon sun, and as a Bally's customer you are welcome to use that too) I will say that the drinks at the pool are EXPENSIVE, one margarita was $14!  Shower pressure was not the best either, and we did have to call to have a lightbulb replaced in our bathroom. Beds were very comfortable.  Our room was 5628 - so that is the number'ish you need for a nice view of the high roller ride and the strip.  But for the price we paid - it was a fine deal.

How anyone could give this less than 5 stars is beyond me.   We got discounted tickets (discount = $8) at the discount ticket place (but there is an even better deal right now with a check in on Yelp (discount = $10). For a $10 upgrade you get a "bar car" - and well worth it.  We went around 4:30 on a Saturday - which was a perfect time - no line at all. We upgraded (of course) to the "bar car" they added a bar car right at the time we were in line. The 3 of us were in a car with another group of 3. At then of our ride - our car only reloaded with 2 people, so you can get very lucky!!!   We had the absolute best bartender Francis, and you think if it is all you can drink in 35 mins, how good could it be?...strap on your extra liver folks and don't be a pussy. They have top shelf liquor (about 4 flavors of Skye vodka, a Ketel One, Patron tequila.. plus all the usual suspects...it was impressive!)  Francis was a fast and started us off with raspberry vodka cocktails, he then made everyone their drink of choice, at some point he handed out shots, he was going nuts.  Of course he made $60 in tips for his 35 min ride with us, so the better/faster these guys are the more they make...If a car had 12 or more people it would be more difficult to feel you got your money's worth. These were 35 of my favorite minutes in Las Vegas.    The views are stunning. One of my friends was a little trepidations, but in the end - she agreed it was fantastic, the cars move so slowly you can barely tell.  Deja in the gift shop hooked us up too...There is some extra deal too, if you spend a certain amount in the gift shop (it was $20 or $30 I think) then you get some super great deal for another ride - I wanna say it was about $12-14 off the regular price for EACH of up to 4 people)

Fine fine...we were hungry and had made zero plans for brunch after a LATE night out. I blame myself - I didn't do my research and we were too tired to care.  We went here. The place was loud on a Sunday at noon - but only about 20% filled.  I had been craving a club sandwich - which they did have on the menu - but it wasn't really a club sandwich it was a turkey bacon provolone sandwich on ciabatta bread. I spit that with another gal who got the egg and bacon and ham sandwich on a baguette - which was better than mine. The highlight was some pretty decent waffle fries.  We left wishing we had just gone to the gourmet hot dog place across the hall.   Too expensive for mediocrity. Service was unenthusiastic and underwhelming

First of all...high props for being open on Thanksgiving morning (2015). We flew in from San Fran at the butt crack of morning and got to Phoenix at about 10am. after calling abut 4 places that were highly rated on Yelp and getting no answer, I tried calling here - WAHOO --open, open, open. We headed out from the rental car lot. This place is about 1.4 miles from the airport and it was busy but not crowded when we arrived. Parking was super easy, neighborhood is not the greatest, but not scary.   You order at the counter and then sit at a table, they bring your food out. We got the savory crepe which my mad LOVED, lots of sun dried tomatoes of yellow and red variety, with mushrooms and goat cheese. He thought he would prefer my order, but he loved this and kept it.  I ordered a biscuit with brisket, sausage, bacon, cheese and eggs. FREAKING delish!!!.    I want to give a a big shout out to the really tasty green iced tea  They were training a new server, he wasn't the faster but 't he was trying, so no worries....I was so happy to have a yummy meal in my belly before the long drive to Tucson.
