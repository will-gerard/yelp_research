Hey guys, so I loved this place when it existed. I went there today and was totally saddened that they closed BUT I asked the owner of the little snack place next to this place and he said they MOVED somewhere to MESA located on BROADWAY or something. We gotta see if this is true! I mean, it might not be open YET but this is the only lead I have! RIP HUACHINANGO (for now hopefully)   UPDATE:  I scoured the internet and found Huauchinango's facebook. They sent a message to Larry Dudley (of the Suns I think lol) saying "come try our food, 1620 W. University Dr. Mesa, AZ"   So there we go guys, that's the last location, let's go eat there and support them!!!!!

Dr. Liu and his staff are a revelation.  The thorough and efficient work by Dr. Liu along with the fantastic customer upkeep through the staff (as well as the general charm and comfort all around) makes this dentistry practice one for the books. These guys are truly a practice that could render dentophobia extinct.  Moving forward, I look forward to seeing Patrick & company. It doesn't matter if its cleanings, fillings, or root canals because you will have a great time and will be clamoring for more oral hygiene!

Kabuki is fantastic. On the levels of quality and price you're getting an absolute steal. I'm not really an authority on sushi but I have a passion for its aesthetics and preparation as well as Japanese cuisine in general. From what I've had here, I can say that Kabuki is an incredibly decent establishment that far surpasses a two to three star rating. I only give it four because a 5 star rating would indicate something completely without flaws (which I will get into).  First off, you can eat like KINGS during the happy hours. Reverse happy hour is a better because you can basically buy one cheap roll ($4) and get one for $1. 6-8$ appetizers (yummy and hearty proportions) and voila, get one for $1. I highly recommend the calamari appetizer!  The sushi is delicious. Preparation and presentation are top-notch (especially for the price you're getting it at) You have beautiful surroundings, GREAT and FRIENDLY service, and artfully crafted sushi served with all the fixings you could ever want.  The desserts are delicious (I recommend the green tea ice cream) and very reasonably priced. The membership plan is genius. Service is never lacking and even in rush hours I get fantastic, friendly, and knowledgeable service.  The only problems I see with this place would perhaps be that, while (most) sushi is delicious, cheap, and prepared quickly, sometimes certain rolls can be hit or miss. A small flaw, but one that should be mentioned.  Everyone has different tastes but I've had sushi here (and I really love food from all over) that just didn't click with me for reasons ranging from texture to overall taste. Again, you can't love everything from any one place so my advice to really get what you know what you'll love. Being adventurous with sushi in general is risky business.  To add, Japanese cuisine and sushi isn't for everyone. I can see from a lot of these reviews that people are giving Kabuki low ratings because this is their first time eating sushi and are unfamiliar with the motions of Japanese cuisine in all. I say to disregard reviews like that because it really involves a mature and open-minded range of taste and acceptance to truly appreciate sushi. Yes, it's probably not the best sushi out there but it's better than average and definitely not "bad". Kabuki is fantastic in my book and in a one month period of living in Scottsdale, I've eaten there four glorious times.

These reviews are awful. "Holds its own against Gus', etc." Well no shit. and another review mentioned how the pizza reminded him of Straw Hut Pizza in California? What? The dude didn't even know he hadn't ordered a deep dish pizza as opposed to a thin crust.  Please people, don't take these reviews seriously.  Little Chicago Pizza is phenomenal and they offer a wide array of delicious Chicago-style offerings like red hot Vienna dogs, Italian beefs, and of course well done authentic Chicago-style THIN CRUST pizza. There is a common misconception where people think that Chicago is only known for one kind of pizza (the DEEP DISH). This is far from the truth. Chicago pizza places (the good ones anyway) can churn out of some the best thin crust pizzas ever. They are notable for their graham cracker crust and their party-style cut (the square cut).  The pizza can hold up to places back home in Chicago, much less shitty $5 places on the ASU campus. People are ridiculous. Get your taste buds in check and really TRY to understand flavors. Chicago-style pizza embodies its own attributes and a reviewer should review the pizza not in the general sense of pizza but in the sense of "if this a good Chicago-style pizza? Did they make this authentically?"  People grew up with different tastes for things and therefore develop bias, so the best and most fair assessment for a pizza place is to judge it on it's tier, quality, and style. LCP is top tier, great quality, and very well done Chicago-style pizza.

Oh man, I just got punched in the stomach, service-wise.  After placing an order ahead of time, to eat there (which I was told was fine), I arrived, was told by three different people (manager included) that they made this one exception to have the food made ahead of time and that I should never ask for that again. Please don't chastise the people patronizing your establishment; that's not cool.    If that was something you couldn't do and really threw a wrench in your kitchen's production, try telling the Filipino hostess to be a little more assertive on the phone and tell me that-that it couldn't be done. It's better than showing up for lunch, and being treated like a fucking pariah (no drinks were offered, we were told several times we didn't have a server because we called ahead). Sorry that, in the interest of a limited lunch break, we try and be expedient and in the process sacrifice a server who can furnish us with drinks/condiments. Man, you guys fucking suck.

The waiter was terribly rude. Food is good though. He outright swore at me because I spoke to him while he was calculating our check up at the register (when I saw him over-calculate something during the adding up process) and he lost his place. It's remedial fucking math. Still tipped the scrub $2. Avoid eating dine-in. He also refused to take my order over the phone to have it ready ahead of time so I can eat there unless I tipped him $10.

Tea Time is a fantastic and affordable place to buy loose leaf tea and a wide array of tea infusers, tea pots, tea containers, and mugs. Sharon, who helped me out at the time, was extremely friendly and helpful. She is a national treasure. Don't miss out on this place for your tea needs. The prices are also incredibly fair.

Republic is great. The service is fantastic and they truly bust their ass to bring the customer the highest quality ramen in this part of town. The prices are fantastic as you can get a huge bowl of delicious ramen for a mere $7 max. When I went I got the tonkotsu (awesome pork broth) with pork and naruto (I would also recommend, of course, an egg but they took all their eggs out of circulation because of a state?wide or countywide recall).  Really cool honesty and professional call on that as even though, as our waiter explained, that their eggs were organic and locally raised and completely unaffected it was better to be safe than sorry and save face if somebody were to ask questions concerning the eggs, BUT I digress.   The ramen was made FAST and served beautifully. The fixings, condiments, and utensils were all abundant, varied, and self-serve and I found that so convenient and well thought-out. Drinks are cheap and self-served and their boba was great.   I highly recommend the mango-almond snow and the taro-blueberry snow. My only con to the boba would have to be that it's a bit of a wait (between 10 and 20 minutes) but that's only because they have to boil the tapioca to order but at least you know you're getting a good product made fresh. Either way, it's a ramen joint and there aren't too many places around the Tempe ASU campus that sells boba, nonetheless fantastic tasting boba like this place. Best way to do it is to order your boba for dessert about halfway through your ramen so you can have sweet slushy finish to your salty, warm broth dinner. Drink water during your ramen as to not muddle and disrespect the ramen's flavor.  Service was great and really you can't ask for more than a friendly-face and enthusiastic service in a cheap high pace college ramen joint that is beautifully decorated and cranking out delicious soups minute after minute for the hordes of broke college kids and hungry twenty-somethings looking for something else than In-N-Out.   Grab your girl or dude, order some ramen, get some boba, sit back, and enjoy.

This place is an absolute gem. The food is delicious (the buffet is made fresh and changed out often and is extremely affordable considering the amount of care and love put into the food). Joann is also the main cook (if not the only one unless her kids are helping her from time to time) so the food is made with the same consistent, authentic home-style quality. Joann is really talented and really flexible when it comes to making her customers happy. I feel like I'm eating in her living room and it's a real comforting feeling.  There is a wide selection of soups, curries, finger foods, salads, noodles, sauces and toppings at the buffet and if there is something missing that you were perhaps expecting/craving, Joann will do her best to scrounge up something in the back especially for you so you walk away feeling taken care of. Every time I go in, the buffet is a bit different. Perhaps the curries are a bit different or one day there's potstickers and others there is eggrolls. I absolutely love this because I feel the variation keeps the place a unique and interesting Thai staple here in the valley.  Again, I must stress that even though it's a "buffet" Joann isn't limited by this and will make you food to order if you request and will do everything in her power to make your experience a good one.  Seriously, probably the best Thai place in the valley and one of my favorite places to eat in general.

I love this place. Fresh, delicious cupcakes, turnovers, pretzels, soups, salads, sandwiches. Very reasonable prices and a talented and friendly owner. It's located in a nice, cozy corner of a shopping strip and it's a quaint location to have a nice lunch on a sunny day. Great place. I ordered a delicious apricot turnover, two peanut butter cookies, and a red velvet cupcake for $6. By the way, the red velvet cupcakes are delicious (with edible pearls on top) and are only 99 cents!

This place is phenomenal. The food is flavorful and very reasonable priced. It's centrally located on the ASU Tempe campus and offers students a great variety that was lacking in that specific part of campus. My favorite thing there was the Bulgogi or Bul Go Kee (as on the menu) and I got a bento box combo that came with a delicious side salad and creamy macaroni salad. For $8, the amount of food and quality of meat was great.   Also, they offer a great selection of both fountain and freezer drinks and snacks and the service is great. The owner is a sweetheart. As another reviewer noted, you can order from an eclectic selection of sides for your meal as well as an inspired and customer-friendly appetizer menu (available in half and full portions for those short on cash or appetite). You can also have your main combo meat normal or "spicy". Options/customization are huge with me. It show's the owner cares to provide a fun and enjoyable experience for their customer. Another cool thing too is that, if you enjoy a certain sauce you can buy bottles of their sauces that they'll make for you (Teriyaki, Ponzu, a crap load of others) for like $3.99. It's a great way to bring a flavor home and support a local restaurant.  The level of detail (in a simplified and user-friendly sense) is astounding for such a small humble place on campus. I hope this place thrives unlike the last two places that were here (Mai and Gyros Hut).  Also, how does it make sense to review an establishment based on a restaurant that used to be in its place? Gyros Hut actually predated Grilled, but you don't see me complaining about they're lack of lamb offering. LOL
