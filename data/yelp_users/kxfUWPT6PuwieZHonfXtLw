Generally, I love Sonic. It is by far my favorite fast food restaurant. This one however, is the worst location I have ever eaten at. The food is extremely inconsistent. Blasts are often not mixed through, so you end up getting plain Vanilla towards the bottom. Order extra items like extra brownie? You MAY get it ... Or you may simply be charged for it but the amount they give you here is so minimal it just isn't worth it. I don't feel like paying for a single tiny brownie thrown in there. Like shakes? Flip a coin ... Because sometimes you will get a shake you can sip with a straw, and other times you get another Blast flavor. When you order cinnasnacks with cream cheese frosting, you shouldn't have to ask for cream cheese frosting separately. I've seriously ordered a few times and didn't get it because I forgot to ask for it.   These are issues I don't have with other locations. I ... just ... don't. Yet, this location is a short walk from my place, so I go for convenience. But I'm not going to expect quality.

When it comes to a haircut, you can either go to a cheap place like Great Clips, or you can spend more money to get a great haircut with a stylist that takes their time. I went to this place for a hair cut assuming that the bigger price tag would mean a great hair cut. Boy was I wrong.   I was greeted kindly by the two ladies at night. Note I stopped short by calling them hair stylists, much the same way I stop short in calling Great Clips employees stylists. For the higher price, I got a quick buzz cut with someone who didn't check to make sure the cut was even. I was in and out of that chair in 5 minutes. For the price, that isn't something I expect.  If you want to pay more for a similar hair cut to the cheap franchises, THIS is the place to go. You will love it here. For me ... someone who expects a GREAT haircut for a higher price, I'm going someplace else. If I want this type of hair cut, I'm saving money and going to Great Clips.  For the owner, you need to get rid of the young brunette girl at night. She is terrible as a hair cutter (not stylist), and makes your business look bad.

First of all, let me state that I have been a long time fan of 5 & Diner. Rarely have I had a bad experience, and never had I had bad food. This has changed however, after visiting this location. Upon entering, it was perfectly clear that the manager was training several of the hostess staff as we wait to be seated. No problem, I understand training is necessary, and the experience with less than seasoned employees will be less than stellar. I get that. What I didn't expect was a bad burger. Normally, the Blue Moon Burger is one of my favorites. At this location however, it was terrible. The burger arrived wrapped in the usual white paper. Although this time, something was different about it. The burger along with everything else was pushed to the back as it was sitting vertically. Eating it was messy because the back end was full of grease and most of the competent of bleu cheese and sauce. Seriously, it was bad. There was taste of some blue cheese toward the front, then was met by a mouthful of mostly bleu cheese at the back. Definitely was not evened out. It was more like eating a bag of melted bleu cheese as desert AFTER a saucy greasy burger. I didn't make a scene by letting the staff know the sandwich was terrible because of the training going on. I'll let them work it out. But for this fan of the franchise, I definitely will NOT be going back to this location. I want to forget about this experience and drive a little further for a different location.

Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.

I have been to this location a number of times,  and each time left with a different opinion of this restaurant. Believe me when I say consistency with regard to service is very inconsistent. The food though,  is generally good for the price. If you have not visited, you owe it to yourself to try it. The restaurant feel is very reminiscent of a Chinese buffet. It is not high end by any means, and servers are there simply to fetch your drinks. Upon sitting (hopefully next to the conveyor belt),  you can immediately enjoy Sushi by picking your desired plate off of the constantly moving conveyor. Choices range anywhere from Chinese soft drinks to fruit juices; from seaweed salad to edamame; from California rolls to jalape√±os stuffed with crab meat and fried in tempura batter; from cheese cake to cream puffs. You get the point. Generally your choices are good for an average to low price sushi joint with plates ranging from $1.50 to $2. Food wise, this place is great. A party of two can have their fill for less than $30, and this is eating to fill you up.   Service is often where this place falls flat. Today, I stood at the booth waiting to be seated with clearly several spots open. We were only seated because I grabbed someone from their duty. He asked a woman,  who was standing there staring at us the entire time,  who suddenly gave the nod like a kingpin leader giving approval to whack a guy. Other experiences were great.  Seated quickly. Another bad experience had us waiting for our bill for close to 30 min.   When service is good, expect a great experience. Just don't expect the same treatment the next you come.   Food and price alone earn this place 4 stars. Inconsistency of service knocks it down two. Today's experience was unacceptable.

Let me start out by saying that I love Famous Dave's. I have a great experience at my usual location. This is my first time trying this one; and it started out terribly. I was quickly seated .... then ignored. The only way I was able to get service after around 15 minutes was to hunt down a waitress and ask for help. This is not what I expect from this restaurant.   I was about to give a one star review, although it was saved by our waitress, who was awesome. So good in fact that I gave a 50% tip. She was the best part of our experience there. The rest of the staff however, leaves little to be desired.

I must say I am impressed by the atmosphere. The outdoor patio is nice, and so is the interior decor. There are lots of TV's to keep the sports enthusiast entertained, and comfortable lounge seating for casual moments. If this was a review of the building and decor, it would be 5 star for a sports bar.  Although, this is NOT a review of the hardware. This is a review of the restaurant; which includes the food, as well as service. Based on the latter two, I will NOT be going back. Our waitress lumbered through the order as confused as any newcomer would be. When asked how many wings come in the order; she had to finger through the menu to read through it with whispered tone. We can overlook this however; assuming our waitress was new. 45 minutes into our wait, our waitress came back with news that they had run out of an ingredient to make one of our dishes. Fair enough, but they could have come sooner for a re-order. Our food arrived 1 hour and 30 minutes after placing our order. And because of this, a member of our party ate cold wings; but did NOT return it for fear of another hour wait. We ordered burgers, some wings, and a personal pizza; absolutely nothing that would warrant that much time.  After being there for over two hours, our waitress gave attitude when asked to split the check.   This is definitely a place to go if you do not mind wasting 2 hours for a meal. And forget about this place for lunch. Where most (all?) places will gladly serve lunch and give enough time to eat within a typical 1 hour; or 1 1/2 hour lunch break ... this one will put you on the bad employees list as you stumble in to work late.  Oh .... and the food? It was great! Minus the cold wings. BUT, the terrible experience put food quality on the back burner.

Chipotle is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. It is usually fast, filling, and all made by friendly employees. Usually. My experience here however, was different and kind of mirrors other reviews. It started with a very impersonal Hispanic lady just repeating what I had said. And if she didn't hear me, repeated the question louder. On down the line I got a sort of friendly Caucasian lady that sort of redeemed the first one. THEN we got to the end. Holy crap. It felt like I was rushed through the entire thing. I turned around to answer a friendly old lady to my left who had a question, then turned around to see two employees with disgusted hurry up fool faces. All of this for a time when there weren't many people? Seriously. It wasn't busy. The location near my home is packed constantly, yet the staff remains extremely friendly. Maybe that is why this location isn't very busy. Please ... get rid of your current staff and replace them with more friendly versions and maybe traffic to your store will improve. Yes, I'm really suggesting you fire them all. They are the front line of your business and are ruining it.

My son and I were debating on what food to get. Of course, we have our holdouts. Unable to come to a conclusion we decided to eat at Gyro House. The food here is amazing and the staff is wonderful. During this visit I had a platter consisting of Lamb gyro and falafel. This honestly was some of the best Falafel I have had in a long time. Come here ... bring your family. You will not be disappointed.

This restaurant has always been one of my favorites. It has been through three transformations by the same owners. As a burrito shop, it was one of the best. I was a little disappointed when they restructured it to be C.A.S.A., but quickly fell in love with their unique sandwiches. Our work time crew frequently suggested this restaurant for lunch. We indulged in sandwiches such as The Fidel, and their amazing OG Burger ... until today. This is their first day of a new menu consisting mostly of burritos. Our lunch party was shocked. Our favorite selections were now gone, and in its place were several burrito choices. My choice was the #11 Chinese Buffet. A burrito with fried rice, spring rolls, and orange fried chicken. Sounds glorious right? The rice did not taste good, and there was too much of it. The orange chicken was good, but I was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you find at the grocery store. The rest of my party of 6 were not impressed by their selections either. The only approval was a co-worker who selected the BBQ chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. This, is possibly the only edible thing on the menu.   Had they taken contents of the old menu, and put them in burrito form, it may have been acceptable. The Fidel in a burrito? OG Burger with fried egg in a burrito? Glorious.  Enough about the food. There were some other issues. This is the first day of their menu, so some of this MAY be somewhat excusable. Our food took a long time, with one of our party waiting over 15 minutes for his meal while the rest of the group was eating. You would think that on their first day of a new menu, they would ask their regulars for input.  C.A.S.A. is now removed from our selection of lunch-time restaurants.

After a weekend of some great off-road adventure I decide to trust a cleaning including a good carpet and seat shampoo to Cobblestone Auto Spa. It was an amazing waste of time. The hand wash was OKAY .... there were many spots missed, so I ended up throwing the doors and top on and going through the express watch, which did a MUCH better job. The carpets were done well and still damp. The seats however ... are a completely different story. The guy told me that he tried shampooing it but the dirt keeps coming out. The first thing I noticed was that the seats look dusty and 100% DRY. There were also mud splatters everywhere that I was able to get out with my finger and some water. If I was able to remove these mud spots with my finger, AND ... everything was completely dry ... THEY DID NOT SHAMPOO MY SEATS. I take it back and was told it would take a couple of hours to do it right. Overall I was there 2 hours the first trip and close to 2 hours for the second one. This was only for a quick hand wash with a carpet/seat shampoo. This experience was terrible. Discount? Refund? Nope. If you are thinking of taking your car here .... go a few miles to another one. You will be MUCH happier.  EDIT: There was a reply by a manager who said I declined an offer. This is crazy because nothing was offered and is PR to make themselves look good. I have no problems modifying my review if they make it right. Although, they did an excellent job on the SECOND pass and offered nothing to keep the customer happy despite what the manager said; which is COMPLETELY false.  EDIT 2: They continue to make excuses as to why it looked like that. When seats are shampooed they are ALWAYS slightly damp. In my case, there were mud spots that could be scraped off with a finger and dirt everywhere. It was also COMPLETELY dry. The second time around however, it was done right and all seats were damp ... as to be expected.

I love ihop. But this one is terrible. I finally decided to try pancakes there and asked if they had real maple syrup. I was told they did and didn't believe them so argued with waiter. He went to the cook to ask and came back saying the hot syrup was real maple. So I trust that advice. Immediately I got a reaction and felt lethargic. Told manager about it and he didn't seem to care that I had an allergic reaction to the false information provided by the staff.  Other times I love the tossed salad with chicken. Description says it is tossed with yellow mustard. Normally, at other places it is tossed like it is described. At this one however, they just give it to you on the side. Small nitpick I know, but if you describe something as tossed in he menu, it should be tossed.  There are several other examples of bad service and food. I will not be coming back to this terrible restaurant. And I suggest everyone else turn away as well.
