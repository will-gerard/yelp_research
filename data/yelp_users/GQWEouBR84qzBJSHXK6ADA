Second time at the Melting Pot last night and it was just as amazing as the first. Our waitress suggested great drinks for me during our meal. The food was incredible, and its really a fun experience to cook it yourself at the table. Great concept for a restaurant. Upscale and classy. Will definitely be back!

Terrible Experience.   My cousin and I went in the other day to request a 7 day pass to try out the gym. First..nobody was overly excited for us to be there. Then...we get told that AFTER we work out we will receive a tour. Does that make any sense? So we were left to our own devices to walk around and see what was what.  So we pick a treadmill, which, are old and shaky and make lots of noises. When we see the sign for "must have towel to wipe down machine." This is when we start looking all over for some sort of cleaning wipe or spray. None. DISGUSTING. Do you expect people to just..wipe off their sweaty machine with their sweaty towel? Gross. Ok..so we moved to the ab room...which stunk to high heaven of B.O. While in there..several extremely old, extremely sweaty men proceeded to us ab balls, machines and mats and not clean any of them off after leaving. We were so grossed out we ended our workout short to leave.  On the way out, we finally noticed one tiny cleaning spray bottle tucked away, obviously not being used.   If gold's gyms are all like this one..i do NOT understand the hype.

LOVE this studio and all the girls who work here. I had been so interested in trying Barre for some time and ever since I did it has been amazing. I have only done it 5 weeks but I can definitely see my body changing already. The girls are so supportive and motivating and always make sure you have correct form!

Just took a giant box of clothes to be sold at platos closet. When I returned to gather my stuff I found out just how lazy the workers are. The girl told me "they were going to have to pass due to wear and tear." This is funny to me because 3/4 of the clothes were only worn once or even new with tags. The 1/4 that was on top of the box was my boyfriends clothes, probably with some wear and tear. Had they bothered to look below that stuff they would've found a lot.
