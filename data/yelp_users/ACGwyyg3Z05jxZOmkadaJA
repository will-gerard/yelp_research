As a restaurant I will give 4 stars but as a buffet I will give 5 stars.  This is the best Chinese buffet I've been so far because 1. The food is very good and way beyond 'buffet' quality. 2. So many dishes. Around 10 cold dishes and around 50 hot dishes plus fruits, salad, desserts, sushi station and Mongolian grill.  They even had frog legs, duck, crab (not legs though) and mussels. I was overwhelmed and ate too much. 3. Clean and the food is fresh. Salmon and cod tasted like they cooked fresh ones, not frozen ones. 4. The people working there are nice and friendly.  My husband and I went there for Sunday lunch and our bill was around $31 including tea and a coke.   Sushi was okay, better than buffet quality, but not as good as ones you get at sushi restaurants as the fish was not so fresh. But I like the made to order idea.  The receipt says we can get $5 discount next time within 30 days. So we will definitely go back to this place in a month.

My favorite dimsum restaurant!  I lived in Hong Kong for 8years and know what real Chinese/dimsum restaurants are.   Although we are not Chinese, we do dimsum on Sundays. So when we moved to Phoenix from Miami, we tried different dimsum places in Phoenix area.  We picked up some local Chinese news papers from a Chinese grocery store and tried the restaurants advertised on it. (written in Chinese, so we assumed they are authentic).   We went to Phoenix Palace, Golden Buddha, Mekong Palace, China King and C-Fu and concluded C-Fu offers the best dimsum.  Our criteria; 1. Variety 2. Taste 3. Freshness 4. Service 5. Price  Phoenix Palace might be the second best. They are as good as C-Fu in variety, taste and freshness, followed by China King whose variety is not high. Golden Buddha is the last. Golden Budda is not Cantonese restaurant anyway.   Staff are all nice at C-Fu and dishes categorized as "A" and "B" are all $2.28 which seem to include most of steamed dishes except expensive ones like shark fin dumplings. We normally spend $25-30 for two including tip.  C-Fu beats all the other places for the super flaky and tasty egg tarts. This is another reason we love C-Fu.

What happened to Shimogamo? I had a good experience there 2 years ago. It was a 4 star sushi restaurant for me that time with good quality of food and service and that's why we went back there for our 3rd wedding anniversary. But our anniversary was totally ruined.  Their service was terrible, just terrible. The only thing they did right was taking order of our drinks and brought them quick. After that things just went wrong in every way. It was  like we were totally not served.   For starter, we ordered beer and they only brought the bottle, no glass although other tables got glasses. That was fine. We tried to get a glass but the waiter never came back to us, even to take orders. We couldn't find the waiter for about 10 mins so we decided to order things we could order directly to the chef at the sushi bar we were seating.  Then they forgot to bring 2 out of 8 dishes we ordered including our appetizer. My husband got his dish around 20 mins after ordering and I had to wait another 15 minutes for mine. My husband finished his drink but had to wait for 20 minutes to get another drink. We again waited for 20 mins for just for the bill, etc.. And every time we needed something, we had to wave them as they never come by us. "Waiting" is the word that explains our experience at Shimogamo this time.   It seemed the chefs at the sushi bar and waiter/waitress were confused about orders all the time. They brought at least 3 dishes to wrong tables. We heard someone dropped dish(es) with a big noise in the kitchen.  Even the quality of sushi was not good this time. The fish was totally not fresh and didn't taste almost at all. It's a fast food restaurant quality.  I think this was our worst experience at a restaurant ever. Sometimes we get not-so-good service or they forget our order but I've never seen my husband so disappointed before. He is a sweet person and gives at least 20% tip even if they forget our order but this time, he only left 15% tip. But I understand that after seeing him waiting miserably for his drink for 20 mins trying to get attention from them without success. Yes, we just felt ignored and miserable. A waitress even got to the sushi bar and asked the chef in front of us whether he's thirsty and needed something to drink but my husband was totally left without any drink for too long.  And for the first time, I heard my husband saying "I will never go back to the restaurant."

This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix and probably the only restaurant I will really miss if I move out of Phoenix.   I'm not familiar with Bosnian food and never been to Bosnia. But when I read some reviews and saw the pictures of tasty looking food on Yelp, My husband and I gave a try and we fell in love with their food. It was the love at first 'taste'.  We do not eat beef and many of the items on the menu have beef. So things we can eat there are very limited. We normally order a soup and chicken sandwiches but still we love this restaurant a lot.   What we love the most about this place is their Bosnian bread. We tried the plain one (with no stuffing) and the one with spinach called Zeljanica. On their menu, it's translated as 'pita' but it's totally different from pita. It's still a kind of flat bread but much more fluffy and not so flat. This bread is very unique and super delicious. They use this bread for sandwiches too. We normally order some extra bread and bring back home to enjoy later. I've been trying to find how to make this bread but so far no luck.  Their desserts are also very delicious. You should try tulumbe which is like big churro in syrup. It's only $1.5 each. Their baklava is also nice and different from baklava you can get from a middle eastern store.  I do not know much about Bosnian food but I assume their food is authentic as they always have lots of guests who are talking in the language I totally do not understand.   This place does not look formal and everything on the menu is reasonably priced but has nice decor and quiet & cozy ambiance. Service is also excellent and people working there are all friendly.   I strongly recommend this restaurant.

I am originally from Japan and this is one of a few Japanese restaurants I love in Phoenix mainly for the following 2 reasons.  1. I can find real authentic Japanese dishes (including sushi) with good quality in a wide variety. 2. All are reasonably priced.  When I say real sushi, I talk about the quality of fish, not about sushi rolls which I don't find in Japan. Well, a few simple sushi rolls like tekka maki (tuna rolls) but definitely not anything like california, spider, rainbow rolls etc. except at fast food style low end restaurants. In Japan I go to both low end ($20-30 per person) and high end ($200-300 or up) sushi restaurants.  Sushi Ken's sushi has quality of a decent sushi restaurant in Japan. It's a really good thing as it seems hard to get fresh fish in Phoenix. First time I had their sashimi lunch set, I was impressed by the quality of the fish. So my guess is they have at least one Japanese real sushi chef who knows fish. In Japan, chefs have licenses and specialized in certain areas (such as sushi, Japanese, ramen, etc.) and are trained for years. (like in the movie "Jiro Dreams of Sushi")  As for the cost performance, I recommend their appetizer & noodle combo($12.5). It's really a good deal considering some of the appetizers are not really appetizer size. I had chirashi sushi (assorted sashimi on sushi rice) for appetizer twice and it's quite filling by itself, then it's followed by a big bowl of ramen. I couldn't finish all of my food. This combo menu was not in the menu but on the wall.  I noticed some people complained about the waitresses there. I so far haven't had any problems with their service. I've been there for 3 times. They were friendly and quick. I don't think it's because I'm Japanese as they were nice to others too. Maybe I just haven't met the notorious waitress yet.   I'm so excited about going back to Sushi Ken soon. And I recommend this place to all who love authentic Japanese food.

I really want to give 6 stars to this place for their very nice service and the food prepared from their heart with passion..   My husband and I just moved to the area and tried out this place for lunch today. They really made me say "WOW". The pita bread is soooo soft. All the dishes on my vegetarian sampler plate were made just perfect with great taste.   Their lemonade is so special. I'm not a big fan of lemonade as it is too sour for me but this lemonade is not sour and has very tender taste. I think they said they add rose water or/and orange blossom water.  The food here is way better than that at Beiz Market. Grocery area is kind of small but they have the right items for middle eastern cooking. And in the freezer you can find the dishes on the menu like grape leaves, pita, spinach pie, etc. so you can bring back home and eat later. They also have fresh bakery of course. We bought feta cheese pita bread.  I can tell from the food they really love food and really know how to cook.  I have a feeling I will go back to this place very soon.

My husband I love sushi (I am originally from Japan) and we love revolving sushi restaurants. We've been to Teharu and Sushi Station before and really enjoyed them. So when we saw the deal on Livingsocial, we bought it ($15 for $30) right away.  Before going there, I checked out the reviews on Yelp and found many  people said sushi there is expensive. So we are sort of prepared. And yes, it was expensive. We went there for Sat lunch. There were few more groups at the conveyor counter. There were differently priced plates from $2.75 to $4.50 like Teharu and Sushi Station. But most of the dishes on the conveyor are on $4.50 plates and only California roll is $2.75. And edamame and gyoza are $3.50. At Teharu, a plate starts at $1 and there are many types of sushi on the $1 plates.  The variety was very low too. There were only 5 types of rolls (which are all  very similar), tuna, salmon and 4 other types of dishes on the conveyor. Nothing like philly rolls, spider rolls, eel, etc we are familiar to. Way less than other revolving sushi restaurants. The conveyor area was very small and there were more seating at tables. So I think they expect us to order mainly than eating from the conveyor.  The quality of fish is better than other revolving sushi restaurants but it's still average.   We stuck to the conveyor as that's the whole reason we drove all the way to Chandler from central Phoenix and we know much better normal (not revolving) sushi restaurants in and near Phoenix.   So we do not think we will ever go back to Sushi Eye in Motion. If we want to go to a revolving sushi restaurant, we will definitely go to Sushi Station and for good sushi and Japanese deserts, we will go to Shimogamo. I like the sushi counter at AJ's on Camelback better as they have a real Japanese sushi chef who chooses fresh fish.

Every time I go to this Benihana, they lose 1 star and this time. I think I had enough and it went beyond the point even if I can get a free meal, I won't go back to this Benihana.  This time we went to celebrate my husband's birthday and we had the $30 certificate.  The quality of the sushi fish became worse. It's very watery, tasteless and not fresh but I won't complain much about it as there are many other sushi restaurants that serve the same quality of sushi in Phoenix. I think it's mainly because it's hard to get good fresh sushi grade fish in Phoenix although there are some Japanese restaurants that serve good fresh sushi.  The thing is their service. We waited about 15mins before the waitress took our order although we decided what we wanted to eat very quickly. She just didn't come back for that long.  Then she made a mistake in our order. My husband said "Sushi and Sashimi combo". She repeated the order as "Sushi combo (without sashimi)". So my husband corrected "No, not Sushi combo, I would like to have Sushi and Sashimi combo" and pointed out the item in the menu. She said "okay".   But.....yes, she brought the small "Sushi combo" instead of "Sushi and Sashimi combo". I told her it's not what my husband ordered. And surprisingly, she said " I thought you ordered Sushi combo"....and seemed she just wanted him to eat that. Hmmmm she "thought"..... So I told her my husband already corrected her mistake once by pointing out it in the menu. Then she said "There must be some misunderstanding but I can change it." I thought " Hmmmm....misunderstanding?" I think it's a obvious mistake, though.  I didn't say anymore as my husband got what he ordered in the end and it was his birthday. In the end, she said "Sorry for the misunderstanding" and I think that is the best we could get from her.  After we finished our entrees, we again had to wait for about 30mins for the waitress to come by.  There's one thing we enjoyed which is the performance of the chef at our table.  So I give them 2 stars instead of 1.

I really loved their almond chocolate croissant which is a heavenly combination of buttery crispy croissant, sweet almond paste and dark chocolate.

My husband and I went to Montreal and we decided to try out an authentic Italian restaurant in Petite Italia (Little Italy) during our trip and we found this restaurant.  We had a great time at this restaurant. Not only the food was nice and authentic but the ambiance was really good. They had a band playing good and pleasant music which we enjoyed.  My husband ordered Linguine pescatore and I ordered risotto with asparagus and sun dried tomato. Both were tasty and the rice in the risotto was cooked in the perfect way (means not too soft).   Tiramisu was one of the best I ever had with generous amount of Marsala wine.  I loved this restaurant and really felt like I was eating in Italy.

I totally don't understand why this place could get more than 3 stars. This place was a total disappointment for me and my husband.  We eat sushi very often. I'm from Japan so I know real good sushi and tend to look for that quality. I also know in Phoenix, it's hard to find 'fresh' fish. But still this place is a total disappointment.  First, it seems like they forgot to season sushi rice. Totally no taste at all which is very odd. For rolls with lots of other stuff and sauce, it could be acceptable but for nigiri with raw fish, it tasted weird. The fish was not fresh at all and we started worrying about getting food poisoning.  Second, we ordered takoyaki (octopus balls) which were deep fried. Takoyaki is a very famous and popular local food in Osaka (where I'm from) so I know what real takoyaki is. I've never seen deep fried takoyaki but can accept it if it's good but they were too oily.  And the service was below average too. The waitress did not repeat our order and she forgot one of the items we ordered.. The appetizer came fast but after that we waited 20-30mins. They were friendly, though.   They seem to have many kinds of rolls so if you like rolls and they don't forget to season the rice or you don't mind plain rice, you still could enjoy this place. But the overall quality of the food is low especially compared with other Japanese restaurants like Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe, Shimogamo, etc.  I don't see any point to go back to this restaurant.

I loved this restaurant. I was very impressed by their menu with a lot of unique dishes. It has a cheese plate with a good selection of cheese in their dessert menu, which is a difinetely a plus for me as a cheese lover.   Alhough we fanced their pizza and pasta menu, we went for Ahi Tuna burger and Magic mashroom burger. They were served with green salad. The ahi was cooked just right and all ingredients in the vegie burger were creating a nice harmony. The dressing on the salad was nice and it was not a typical side salad.  For dessert, we ordered banana churro which had nice banana cream inside with vanilla bean icecream on the side.   I've tried so many restaurants all over the world but Brick is one of the best in terms of the food. As for the service, we had to wait for a while for our waiter to come back a few times but he was very friendly and professional. I think the chef really knows how to cook and combine different ingredients. Their food is cooked in a healthy way too. So I will go back to this restaurant soon.

Wow! Very delicious sandwiches! My husband and I agreed their sandwiches are the best we've had in Phoenix so far, They are not typical subs at all. They are made with very fresh meat, cheese and veggies and really mouthwatering. Especially I liked the delicious cheese. We had a prosciutto sandwich ($8.99) and black forest sandwich($6.99). I also loved the honey mustard sauce in my black forest sandwich.   After eating sandwiches, we decided to have some desserts. I was totally overwhelmed by the selection of nice looking cakes. They had coconut cream mousse, chocolate pistachio mousse, caramel apple mousse, chocolate cup mousse, cream horns, tiramisu, napoleon, cannoli, etc. etc. don't they all sound yummy?  I finally decided to try something new to me. I forgot the name but it's a kind of pudding with fruits and two kinds of creams in rum syrup. The lady working there told me it's popular in Vulcan countries. My husband had cherry chocolate mousse. We were both satisfied with our choices. And they are $2.95 and $3.95, which I think quite reasonable.   It's a small place with 5 tables or so and I think family-owned. People working there are nice and friendly. Thier food is mostly Italian/French style with some East European taste.  Next time I want to try their bread or croissant. I wish this place was located closer to our home but probably worth driving all the way to get there.

I went there yesterday for the first time with my husband and we had bagel sandwiches(ham&cheese, tuna) and donuts(chocolate covered, toasted coconut) which we enjoyed them a lot.   The donuts are very soft and fresh. I found them a bit too sweet but my husband seemed to enjoy the sweetness. I still think this place is one of the best donuts places in Phoenix.   Good variety of donuts and they also have croissant and bagel sandwiches and boba drinks, which is very similar to Rainbow Donuts on McDowell. This place is bigger with more variety.   Customers kept coming while we were there and a few customers were waiting all the time as only one lady was handling all the customers. Not that I complain about that but I felt sorry for her. She was handling all the customers inside and at the drive thru. But she was handling them very well and with a very polite manner saying "thank you for waiting" to every customer. She was pretty quick to prepare our order too.   The price is also quite reasonable. I forgot the exact prices but a donut was around $.75 and  sandwich was $3.49 each if I remember correctly.

I love revolving sushi restaurants. As far as I know, there are 3 revolving sushi restaurants in Phoenix area, of which I think Sushi Station is the best. A lot of variety is the thing I like the most about this restaurant. About 20 rolls, 15 types of sushi, 5 salads, 5 appetizers and 5 desserts including carrot cake, 3 kinds of cheese cake, chocolate moose cake, cream puffs and jello on the conveyor. Just looking at them moving on the conveyor is a lot of fun.  Sushi Station is not the cheapest of the three. Teharu is the lowest but the quality is not so good. But you can get 10% off coupon from Sushi Station's website.   The quality of Sushi Station is much higher than Teharu, although it is still the quality I expect for a revolving sushi restaurant but it's good enough, esp for the price. If I want to eat real good sushi, I will go to Shimogamo or other authentic Japanese sushi restaurants but it is the fun experience and reasonable price that I expected from revolving restaurants. So I'm sure I will go back to Sushi Station soon.

I went to this restaurant with my husband today after we got a 50% off voucher from Livingsocial. We'd been talking about trying out this restaurant anyway since we saw the sign on Camelback St. We both love Mediterranean food and Mediterranean buffets are hard to find.   I think they have good variety. I tried mostly cold dishes such as Greek salad, chickpea salad, grape leaves, etc and they were quite tasty, not the top quality but good enough considering this is buffet food. I found falafel and chicken were bit dry but still tasty. All kinds of hummus were good, esp the one with sun dried tomato. Some dishes were spicy and some were not. Desserts were totally not Mediterranean. I expected something like baklava but they were like the ones I see at Chinese buffets. I liked their custard pudding, though.   I have a question mark on the cleanness. I picked up a plate to get food and there was a lot of sauce at the bottom of the plate. I picked up another plate but it was also not cleaned well with some bits of food still on it. And I did not like a fly trying to eat my food all the time.   Overall, it was okay and value for money. I think we will go back there again sometime as we love Mediterranean food.  -Update on July 22- Yesterday I gave 3 stars but today I had to change it to 1 star.   My husband and I both got food poisoning and I had to spend almost whole night in the bathroom.   I don't know which dish(es) was contaminated but guess many people who ate at this restaurant yesterday got food poisoning.  It's a big disappointment as the food itself was not bad but it was a horrible experience for us and we won't go back to this restaurant.
