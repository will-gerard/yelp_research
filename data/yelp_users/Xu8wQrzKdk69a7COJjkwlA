The office is new & clean. Front staff was funny and somewhat attentive, one in particular was, the other ones kind of ignored us patients.   I explained it was a routine visit, but I had some concerns and also I was sick.  I did get my one concern covered, but barely got examined. And my illness was completely ignored.  2 days later I was at urgent care and on a trifecta of meds for a bronchitis I've developed. I definitely feel this could have been prevented or diagnosed correctly if I had gotten more than a look over with minimal examination.   I have seen Dr.Holland as a kid and if I recall correctly he is awesome, but the NP, I would not want to see again. I'll probably just switch doctors all together. I prefer DO's anyways. They seem more attentive and empathetic to their patients. In fact the doc I saw at the urgent care today was a DO.

This is my first night of two staying here so if I remember to update if there are any changes I will.  I am here for a friends wedding and so far so good.   I called the night of my check in just to let them know I would be late for check-in and they were A-okay with that! :)   There is a $50 deposit, but I read that on another review so I was prepared. As long as I get it back I am totally okay with that, I understand why they do it.   This is a downtown location and I don't recommend this place for families, but as a person who lived among druggies and people as such - if you don't mess with them, they don't mess with you 9/10 times. If you are here to enjoy Fremont, Vegas or whatever and want a cheap place to stay then you are just fine, my friends!   My husband and I got an updated room (my husband wasn't happy I booked a lower star hotel). We had a modern grey carpet, newly painted room, updated bed/sheets and gray tile. I know there are pics floating around with old gold bedding and we didn't have that.  The cable is good, the heat/ac is good. I haven't showered yet, but my husband says the temperature goes from hot to cold, he analogied it to a roller coaster lol.   Just cause I read a review of bed bugs I did bring my own blankets and pillows. I asked the front desk about it and they admitted they did have a room with the problem, but that it was being treated and it still wasn't available for use till the problem was rectified. I really appreciated their honesty.   My husband was solicited for drugs when he went outside to get some waters for us, but said no and wasn't bothered again. Also, this is Vegas. Every time I come here whether I am in a super nice place or not I am ALWAYS solicited for dugs. It's just the name of the game here. This is a party town lol! That is also NOT the hotels fault.  Okay, so 2nd night -  I was a drunk, hot mess and we had zero issues this time. No drug solicitors, it was quiet. The room stayed nice and warm.   As long as I get my deposit back today I will be very happy with this stay.  I am going to give this place 5 stars - it is a basic motel, you get what you pay for, but I would definitely stay here again if I was hitting up fremont.   Also, no bed bugs here in my room :)   Oh and I forgot - the overnight person is super amazing. I didn't catch her name, but she was super chipper and friendly for 1am when we originally arrived! Lol. :)

I had made a reservation specifically for a strip view room. When I got here I was offered a smoking room. I said that's not possible due to health issues. Then they offered me 1 bed despite there being a total of 3 people.   Now I'm in a craptasric room "premiere"? Premiere what? Premiere Vegas a$$hole view?   The least they could have done was upgraded my room. I would have accepted whatever view I had to take with a better room.   Will never ever stay here again based off the crap customer service alone. The only reason I am staying is cause I had my credit card already on file and paid for some of my stay when I booked.  ND - August 12 2014

The care was fine. The 1 star is for their billing department. They refuse to take the payments I can afford (they want $140, I can do $70 until April then $200 after that). They threaten collections and say if I don't apply for their financial assistance program like some welfare case then there is nothing I can do.  They want my pay stubs, income tax info etc... I can do that. I am more than willing to prove my income. But they still threaten me.   I am completely at my wits end with this hospital. I don't want this in collections. I am cleaning up my credit, not adding more bullshit on there.   Banner needs to get their act together. Any other hospital would be willing to take whatever, I am offering a decent amount.

2 stars. I'd give 0, but my sandwich wasn't terrible. So 2 stars for my food being good. 3 for below average service.  Unfortunately, it's close and one of my boyfriend's favorite fast food places so I may end up eating here again, but not by my choice.   Anyways, all the sandwich makers had scowls on their faces, shit attitudes.   I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and my sandwich maker forgot the avocado (the reason I even got the sandwich), so I told her to just add that on and we'd be good. She scooped it up and put it on the edge of the sandwich and put the bread on... didn't spread it or anything.   Since she was already in a shit mood I just decided to take it home and I'd spread it myself.  When I got home the avocado was all over the place, but not in my sandwich and the damn thing wasn't even cut all the way through...  Messing up my food is a sure fire way to piss me off. I had half a mind to just throw my sandwich at them and make them redo it and do it correctly.   It's not difficult to make a damn sandwich. Next time I'll suggest just letting me go back there and making my own (if I am ever forced to go back).   I'd suggest Jimmy Johns or Silver Mine in Tempe. Much better service and food.
