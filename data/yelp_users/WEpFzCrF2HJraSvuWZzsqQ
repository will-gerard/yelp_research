Dr Nagul is excellent. He picked up on some issues that my former docs never even thought to look for; as a result, my health is improving daily. But the practice has some quirks that a new patient needs to be aware of:  Dr N doesn't accept marketplace insurance. Copays must be paid by cash or check ONLY, no credit/debit cards (and the receptionist may or may not tell you when you make your first appointment). Everything is on paper, there are no electronic records or prescriptions. Secure, yes. Inconvenient, YES.

Stopped in here for lunch today shortly after 11. Nobody else in the place (customers, I mean), so of course I was greeted and seated immediately.  The garlic chicken was tender and perfectly garlicky, the egg drop soup delicious, the sides more or less standard-issue (but still tasty). The servers kept my cup filled with soda and otherwise stayed out of the way.  Shortly after I started on lunch, a few other people came in and were greeted like family  - guess they were regulars.   I don't get up this end of town much, but next time I'm there I'm definitely going to come back. to Bamboo China.

As has been noted by the other reviewers, China Restaurant (kudos for the creative name!) is CHEAP. If you've only got $5 for lunch, this is where you want to be.  The food is not very authentic (it's Americanized Chinese, what do you expect?), but it is very tasty. I make a point of trying something different every time, and I'm there 2-3x weekly. It's close to my work, and did I mention that's it's cheap? Most lunch combos are around $3.50, with dinners around $5. Dinner combos pile on the sides: wings, wontons, eggroll, and rice as well as a large entree. The quality of the food is surprisingly good, considering the price. Dine-in meals include a bowl of decent egg drop soup.  China Restaurant does accept credit cards. I work with the guy who convinced them to start taking plastic, and Cindy, the very friendly and efficient manager, agrees that this was a great move. So, all you non-cash-carrying people, you've got no more excuses to avoid the place.

I had a total thyroidectomy at Banner Desert, and my experience was about as flawless as possible. Everybody I dealt with, on both the admin and medical sides, was 100% professional and competent. My private room was spartan, but functional and clean. Hell, even the food was good. My procedure and recovery went so well that now, only 28 hours later, I'm nearly pain-free. I have no problem recommending Banner Desert to anybody.

Food: excellent. Everything I've tried has been great. Service: excellent. Ambience: yes, it's dark. I always get takeout so I don't care either way. The only problem I have with Golden Gate is a lingering cloud of sewer funk out front; it's there every time I go.

Not the cheapest, but definitely the most thorough. Where others would have thrown their hands up in horror at the condition of my poor neglected and abused (not by me!) Crown Vic, Chris and his techs pushed through and got her back into good running condition. Once my poor abused (yes, by me) credit card cools off, we'll be coming back to finish restoring her.

I went to Freeway by recommendation of USAA, looking for a new Cruze. Rolled in at 1330 today with a severely upside-down trade, not much cash down, and iffy credit. Rolled out at 1700 with a 2012 Cruze LS with 32 miles on the clock and completely reasonable payments.  Thanks to David Daniels (sales) and Tracy Soli (finance) for the most painless car-buying experience I've ever had. The whole process was pressure-free and comfortable.

Sorry, guys, I have to knock you down 1 star for your service department. I brought my new car in for some odd stereo issues (randomly un-pairing my phone and resetting itself when I try to browse my iPod) and a vibration in the transmission in 4th gear, which other Cruze owners have noted. The SA flatly dismissed the stereo problems and said the trans problem was me lugging the engine. Yeah, no. But thanks for treating me like an idiot.

Aaaand now I'm knocking you guys down again. You keep pestering me via email and snail mail and phone to bring my Cruze back - I TRADED IT BACK TO YOU FOOLS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. Update your damn records and stop spamming me like I've asked you so many times before!

Aaand we're done. Logan, the "Customer Satisfaction Manager" or some such, called me yesterday. When my phone lit up with your number, I assumed it was due to the outstanding (and completely pointless) recall. Nope, he very clumsily tried to convince me to come back yet again and buy yet another car.  I have told you multiple times to cease contact. You keep telling me you'll cease contact. AND THEN YOU KEEP CALLING ME. You know the civil penalties for ignoring a do-not-call order? $500 per incident, with triple damages if you do it intentionally. Call me again, I dare you, I double DOG dare you, and I will file suit for harassment. You got that, Freeway?

I wouldn't have believed it had I not experienced it firsthand, but I've found a place that makes better lasagna and pasta sauce than me. I figured the pasta dishes were single-serving, and technically speaking, what I got last night *was* a single serving (as in, I ate the whole thing - lasagna, salad, and garlic bread) while sitting at the outdoor table, but 20 hours later, I'm still full. Eventually, I'll waddle back to try the pizza and other dishes (BBQ ribs, in an Italian take-out joint? ooookay...).  I was a bit put out by the absence of calzone on the menu, but the order-taker-guy said they were considering adding them. The salad had a slightly odd taste, most likely caused by being rinsed in the Valley's notoriously horrible water. Otherwise, I'm definitely hooked.

Fancy Pets got my Persian in on short (two days) notice to give her the full spa treatment and lion cut. The facility is sparkling clean and quiet, with grooming operations in full view of the lobby. Everyone I spoke to was courteous and professional, and the groomer did a fantastic job. Kitteh's happy, I'm happy, everyone wins!

I've been coming here for a couple of years. I've bought three pistols, a metric crapload of AR mags, and other gear and goodies. I'm on the range once per week (wish it could be more often, but LOL $AMMO$). I sprung (springed? sprang?) for the annual membership and very glad I did - free range time and discounts on everything more than makes up for the cost, plus there's the annual member's day.  The service is always excellent, whether people are stacked up three deep waiting to shoot on Friday night or the place is deserted. The range guys know their stuff and will happily discuss the innermost secrets of pretty much any gun.  The target holders are pretty badly beat up (FFS, people, watch where you're shooting, and if you don't know how to aim, ASK SOMEONE) and in need of overhaul. The ventilation system is usually very good but very occasionally stops running; when it does, management is on it immediately.  The classes are top-notch, with some of the best instructors I've ever dealt with. If you're serious about wanting to be a better shooter, this is where you want to go.  ETA: I see a lot of people complaining that they weren't allowed to rent guns solo. There's a good reason for this policy, and it's not exclusive to Shooter's World. Feel free to PM me if you want the explanation (note, I don't represent SW or any other shop; I've simply been a shooter for a very long time and have seen a LOT).

First, the good:  +RSSC is a lot more travel-friendly for us east-siders than BASF up in the far north. +The RSOs are very strict (as they should be) but not confrontational. If you're stupid enough to argue with an RSO, then I don't know what to tell you except to find an uncontrolled shooting spot. And if you feel an RSO is being unprofessional, tell the rangemaster. +The range fee is entirely reasonable. The cost of a single annual membership is equal to a monthly visit for a year, so if you go more than once per month, it's a good deal. +The sandbag rests are most helpful for those of us who don't want to invest in a Lead Sled or similar, nor deal with the hassle of hauling the thing to the range and back. +Decent selection of targets at very cheap (and on the honor system) prices.  Now, the not so good:  -The parking lot's proximity to the main range means you'd better damn well put your ears on before you get out of your car, and make sure the windows are rolled up before you leave the paved road. -Ditto the check-in office, which makes conversing with the guy in the office a huge PITA. -The shooting stands are pretty closely spaced. If you happen to end up next to someone shooting a heavy caliber (or even an AR) with a muzzle brake (which brings up a point, who the hell needs a recoil reduction device on a freakin' AR in the first place?), you *will* feel it.  All told, RSSC is a damn good range and highly recommended.

Good: the eye candy is delicious, and the udon is decent.  Neutral/Bad: pretty much everything else. I couldn't hear but maybe 20% of what my dinner companions were saying over the blaring music, even when they were sitting right next to me. Overabundance of loud, obnoxious Guidos and douchebags with the obligatory popped collars and fauxhawks. I'm a sushi n00b, but even I could tell the bland, limp things my companions ordered were not right - if it's supposed to be tuna, shouldn't it be at least marginally tuna-flavored? The green tea tastes like coarsely-ground tree bark and looks like antifreeze. Finally, being in Old Town, parking is non-existent unless you're willing to walk from one of the public lots.  I'm not going back, not even on a bet. There's plenty of better sushi places in the Valley.

I love Pop. They've got stuff I've never heard of and wouldn't try on a dare, but just the fact they *do* have it is awesome. They're the only place in the western 75% of the US to stock Captain Eli soda (pro-tip: try the blueberry, it's AMAZING), and the cute cashier chick agrees that Eli is some of the best soda to be found. The staff knows their products and can answer the most obscure questions imaginable. They can also order anything they don't currently have in stock.  It's probably good that Pop is so far out in the East Valley, because I'd be in there every day if it was closer to me.

Friendly, competent counter help, fabulously delicious (if rather mildly flavoured) food, and you can hang out, blissfully inhaling, in the spice aisle while you're waiting. The chicken shawerma plate is huge and the hummus is wonderfully smooth. My sole complaint is that the takeout "line" is kind of haphazard and random instead of our polite and orderly Western queues; put it down to cultural differences.

I'm a former employee of another gentlemen's (sic) club chain and was fairly traumatized by the experience - nobody does drama like strippers. Regardless, sometimes you just gotta have a hot, (semi)naked woman on your lap and the only way to get one is to bribe her. So, after nearly five years since my last visit to any strip joint, I checked out Christie's this evening.  First impression: very nice and mellow. Dark, yes. Loud music, meh, goes with the territory. Absolutely professional staff and attentive waitresses.  The talent: yow. I don't know what some of y'all have been looking at, but I saw something to appeal to pretty much every taste, from waifish schoolgirl types to an Amazon who looked like she could break me in half, and all the colors of the melanin spectrum. All of the girls who approached me were friendly (even when I passed on getting a dance), and they all smelled good. Two of the girls who asked if I'd like some company happily plunked themselves down on my lap and made small talk before (and after) getting down to business.  Basically, Christie's doesn't have that "here's-my-boobs-now-pay-me" vibe. To go by the number of obvious regulars I saw, this isn't a fluke. It's how they normally are, and I call that a good thing.

Been coming here for a few years, 2-3x weekly. I've tried pretty much everything and it's all good, although I generally go with my favourite combo lo mein. The front of the house is clean, but the restroom is... well, it kind of calls Silent Hill to mind. Prices are reasonable and the staff are all friendly and competent.

If you don't live in Tolleson, Pete's is pretty much the only reason to come here. But, it's a damn good reason. The fish is tender and tasty, the shrimp strip things are addictive, the chips have that perfect combination of crisp and soggy, the sauce has a delightful tang. The only place I've had better fish and chips is Ireland.

What can I say about Chino that hasn't been said already? I was introduced by a couple of IT geek friends - yes, it really is a geek hotspot, with good proximity to some of the biggest IT employers in the Valley. I was initially intimidated by the ordering system, but it's really not that difficult after a couple-three repetitions (and believe me, after one visit you WILL be back). The samples were invaluable in helping me understand the different flavors and textures.  And oh my %DEITY%, what flavors and textures. Whether you like it mouth-scorchingly hot or mild and sweet or both at the same time, Chino has something for you.   The ambience? Frankly, who cares? It's a low-class dive and that's how the regulars like it. Bring on the grub and let the peeling walls and stained floors look after themselves.  I live 49.6 miles from Chino North and even further from the Chandler location, and I still make a point of taking my daughter there monthly. I usually get Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, pork fried rice and black beans (with Sobe Lean from the fountain because, you know, I'm just that health-conscious), but I've tried everything on the menu and it's all great.  Seriously, if you've never been, you need to at least give Chino a try. Just be warned, it's addictive. About the only thing that could make it better is if they delivered.  PS: VOLCANO COOKIES FTW.

Oggie, oh Oggie, how do I love thee. Savory, warm and filling, perfectly good with or without the wine gravy. And the chips, just plain, no garlic or cheese, my gods... simple, potato-y perfection. I suppose I'll one day be adventurous and sample the other styles, but for now, Oggie is all I need. That, and a lack of hipsters and overly loud music.

After multiple visits and having tried their other offerings, I'm upgrading my rating of Cornish Pasty Co to five stars. Last night it turned out my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I couldn't even touch dessert (the very appropriately named strawberry pavlova) until this morning; a Porky and mushy peas was all I needed for 12 hours straight.  My new life goal is to eat one of everything Cornish Pasty makes. I might die in the process, but I'll die happy.

I've been a Cox internet-only customer since November 2011. Service is mostly stable, speeds are mostly reasonable. But two unannounced rate increases (December 2013 and January 2015), not so much. This is a seriously lame trick to pull on your customers, arbitrarily altering the deal (pray they don't alter it further).

Over the past three years, North Buckeye Animal Hospital has taken care of nine cats for me - four of my own, and a stray mamakitty and her four babies who turned up on my patio last spring. Drs Medlin, Spiker, and Jepsen, as well as their entire staff, have always been remarkably helpful, friendly, and efficient, whether they're just giving a basic checkup and vaccinations, or more serious issues. For example, when it came time to put my ancient cat down, they helped him on his way with pure kindness and compassion.  Whenever I call, no matter who answers, they immediately ask how my girls are. They take the time to get to know their patients (and their patients' people). The techs go into fits of OMGSQUEE when I bring in my Ragdoll and Persian, so, you know, I'm inclined to think kindly of them.   I also have to give a shout-out to Kim, the groomer. She gives my Persian a perfect, show-quality lion cut twice yearly.  Simply, I have nothing but good to say about NBAH.

I hadn't been to Fibber's before the takeover/COM, so I don't know any different. From my three visits in the past month:  -The staff (tables and bar) are attentive and professional. -The food is excellent, albeit somewhat spendy ($20 for a Guinness and fish and chips? Sheeeesh...). -The aforementioned Guinness was, as advertised, Perfectly Poured(tm). -The ambience is as genuine as it gets.  It's not quite on my "I have to check in here at least once a week" list, but it's a good occasional outing.

I'm not normally a fan of Memphis-style BBQ, but Memphis Best is changing my mind. Their menu is surprisingly varied for such a small place (turkey dinner? yup, and how about some pie for dessert?), and the quality of the food is outstanding.  The sauce is sweet and smoky, and never overwhelms the flavor of the incredibly tender meat.  Low points: service isn't exactly fast - not slow, but don't plan on coming here for lunch if you only have 30 minutes or so. The coleslaw is uninspired. Parking is rather tricky, with some perpendicular spaces immediately behind the straight-in spots; considering the number of huge duallie pickup trucks in Buckeye, you may find yourself doing several 3-pointers to get out between them. They close rather early, 8 p.m. most nights.  Those minor complaints aside, Memphis Best is some d*mn good BBQ. If you're in Buckeye, check 'em out.

So, a carnivore goes into veggie restaurant...  No, seriously, this is great stuff. I have a friend who's a veggie and loves Indian food, so when I noticed this place sandwiched between a hair salon and a pizza chain, I had to tell her. We checked it out tonight, and DAMN. The Gobi Manchurian is amazing, especially with the mint chutney. The spinach dosai is very good, but a bit dry (not that that stopped us from fork-fighting over the last bits). This unrepentant flesh-eater went away completely happy and didn't miss the meat at all. Think I'll be coming back at least once a week.

Had an amazing experience with these guys today. I rolled in with my impossibly weird head, explained the fitting issues I had with my current Arai Signet Q, they asked some relevant questions that other shops never asked (what and how do I ride, what's the best fitting helmet I've owned to date, etc). They gave me a medium Defiant to try on; it fit perfectly, but wasn't a solid colour, which I prefer. They pulled out a large silver model, swapped out the pads, push-pull tested it on my melon, and five minutes later I had a gorgeous, comfortable, perfectly fitting (and expensive, but Arai is like that and well worth the cost) lid.  Everyone here is friendly, competent, and very very good at their job. They don't work on commission so they're not going to push you toward high-end gear if that's not what you want. If you take your riding at all seriously, this is where you want to source your gear.  I chose 'moderate' for pricing because you can spend as much or as little as you want. I tend toward spendy gear, but if all you need is a skid lid, go for it. There's no dedicated bike parking, but you're not going to see a lot of cages here so feel free to double up in the full-size spaces.

Josh Lutz, the owner of Southwest Premier, conducted a prepurchase inspection for me yesterday. The entire process was amazingly smooth, from initial scheduling to going over the final report.  Josh arrived before I did, and I was 10 minutes early. He explained to me exactly what he was doing and what he was looking for every step of the way. The concern and attention to detail that he brings to his customers is truly amazing.  Next time I'm in the real estate market, Southwest Premier is getting my business again. I'm also going to recommend Josh & Co to my friends who are in the market.

The place: amazingly clean. Friendly, competent (and, it must be said, seriously cute) order girls. Lobby is a great guy to chat with.  The fare: the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers is fantastically juicy and well seasoned without being overwhelming. The chili burger is topped with just the perfect amount of chili, not a little dab like some places and not completely burying the burger like others. The fries, well, they could be better, maybe a little more crisp. Need to try a dawg next time I go (which will probably be very very soon). Yeah, Lobby's costs more than McD's or similar, and it's well worth it.

I've been to Argento's twice - nothing personal against them, I just don't go much for pizza. Their calzones are huge and the pie is very tasty and, AFAIK, authentic (absolutely nothing compares to a slice hot off the cart in Manhattan). Their two-slices-and-a-Coke lunch deal looks like a winner. Prices are reasonable and service is fast and accurate.

Altered Tails has done three spays (one adult cat, two kittens) and two neuters (both kittens) for me, and all of the cats were very well cared for. The staff are professional and no-nonsense. The waiting room and parking lot are clean, although occasionally noisy. I've seen plenty of small dogs (and medium, and big) here, and they had no problem with anesthetizing small female kittens, so I don't know what the previous reviewer is talking about.  I'm adopting a stray tom who needs vax and snippening. I'm bringing him to AT. 'nuff said?

Came here this morning for a painful procedure that needed done quickly (so my primary couldn't do it) but wasn't urgent enough to warrant an ED visit. Waiting area was very clean and quiet, although all the posters for QUICK WEIGHT LOSS PRESCRIPTIONS were rather... yeah. Admitting staff are prompt and professional, paperwork is kept to a minimum, and the nurse practitioner who got to deal with my disgusting self was top-notch, especially when she calmly talked me through the lidocaine injection. The experience wasn't pleasant, exactly (anything involving scalpels and needles is pretty much unpleasant by definition), but everyone here made it much less unpleasant than it could have been.

Yay I'm reviewing a grocery store (oh g-d when did my life become so pedestrian). :-/  I've been coming to this Fry's almost exclusively since I moved to Tempe in 2011. The location is good, especially with the neighboring shops. The store is usually very clean and well lit. The deli and produce are very well stocked, the meat is always good and fresh, and the butchers are happy to accommodate pretty much any request. I've never encountered a grumpy employee, even after the usual six pm rush. Tired, sure, but not snappish.  Things to watch out for: the store layout is a bit strange, kind of haphazard toward the center. The parking lot is very large but tends to confuse people, so there's a lot of wrong-way drivers - keep your head on a swivel, especially at the west end near Starbucks, with all those caffeine-deprived people awaiting their fix (and there's a Starbucks in the store as well, no longer Tully's - market oversaturation, guys, LEARN YOU IT).

I've recently been forced to go gluten-free and was happy to hear that Tryst has extensive GF options. The GF bread is very good, so much so that I didn't miss regular wheat bread at all. The roast beast is tender and flavorful, and the kalua pork is amazing. The sweet potato fries were perfectly done. My servers were attentive and friendly and kept me well supplied with iced tea.  Seating is a bit awkward and crowded, and the storefront is a little set back and hard to identify in a VERY frantic parking lot. Other than that, and the location being almost 30 miles from my home, Tryst is awesome.

Apparently I'm one of the few.  Bought a new RIA 1911 here the day after Christmas. I didn't dink around wanting to see and touch everything in the shop; I knew what I wanted and didn't waste time. Did the paperwork, paid cash, out the door in less than an hour.  Except that the gun was assembled with incorrect parts, making it impossible to take down for cleaning. I took it back it the next day and asked them to confirm that I'm not an idiot. They said they'd send it back to Armscor for repair. They didn't say that they were going to sit on the gun for two weeks before sending it back. "We had to wait for authorization from Armscor." Funny, when I called Armscor for a status check that same day, they didn't say a word about that to me.  OK, so after two weeks, AZ Firearms finally gets around to sending my gun in for repair. I hear nothing for another two weeks, and I post a rant to one of my forums. A moderator sends my complaint to Ivan and Gene at Armscor, who immediately jump on the problem and fix my gun, admitting that their QA had screwed the pooch. They shipped it back last Wednesday (side rant: according to UPS, Wednesday + 2nd Day Air = Monday). It arrived this morning. Having worked for an FFL, I know exactly what's involved in processing incoming and outgoing firearms, so I gave AZ Firearms three hours before I pinged them.  "We have a shop full of people. We're working on the incomings and we'll call you when it's ready!"  It's now 1715 and they close in 45 minutes.  Every gun shop in the entire US has had a shop full of people every day since November 2008, so don't give me that excuse. Logging the incomings, unless you're talking about shipping levels on par with SHOT, doesn't take all damn day. If it does, you need to hire more help and/or streamline your process. What you don't do is tell your customers that you're too busy to deal with their piddly-ass warranty work.

PJ's response prompted me to write this update.  Since the RIA debacle, I've been back to AZ Firearms a few times, mostly for ammunition, once for a C&R transfer. They've been very helpful and much more efficient than my first experience. Whatever the underlying issue was, I'm happy to see it's apparently been resolved.

First, the talent (the most important factor in any club): Hot dancers who can hold a conversation as well as they do their, uh other skills. They tend to be long and lean (although there are plenty of curves as well), middling-to-heavily inked, very little plastic in evidence. They're not pushy at all and actually help one another out - I tipped one, she missed it and left it on stage when the next girl came up, the second girl warned her instead of sniping it, and the first girl came by to thank me and apologize for missing it. That's class right there.   Staff: Friendly, personable and competent. Unobtrusive DJ who plays a good mix, leaning toward heavier music. Volume is high enough to provide a good background without making you shout to be heard.  Prices: Entirely reasonable. Nobody's going to try to rip you off or try to hard-sell VIP.  Premises: Yeah, the place is small, especially the stage. I like it, personally.  I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5 only because when I arrived at 1930 on a Saturday, it was dead: two dancers, and one other customer who was nursing a drink at the bar. It picked up around 2230, so that's OK.  Highly recommended.

I've been to this VZW store multiple times for different reasons - upgrades, accessories, most recently replacement of a phone that I managed to drop on its face, yey. I've never experienced anything but great service, never any pressure to bump my data plan (I have 1GB, and I and my kid together barely use 300MB) or buy the shiniest new toys.

Great sound. Great location. Great bands. GREAT eye candy. Can't speak for the beer or the food, but if it's as good as the rest of the place, I surely won't be disappointed.

I took my beloved Penny in for an estimate to repair her t-bone damage on 6 September. Steve Grothaus worked up a very detailed estimate and shot it over to USAA within an hour. The next day, we ordered two new doors and all the other parts that got crunched.  10 September, baby's in the shop with a projected work time of 13 days.  13 September, Steve calls me to advise me of the work's status and says I should have her back late next [this] week, ahead of schedule.  17 September, Steve calls me to say she's almost done, just a bit of tweaking and blending left to do and I should have her back Wednesday or Thursday.  19 September, Steve calls and says she's done, I can pick her up after 1500. I show up at 1530, baby looks absolutely flawless. There's zero evidence that she'd been pranged and she's spotless inside and out.  Work completed to perfection and four days ahead of schedule, with the customer kept in the loop the entire time? Yep. As good as it gets.

Been here a few times, got the Magic Plus ($8) wash each time. It's a good, basic touchup that doesn't beat the hell out of your paint like a rotating brush washer, although I kind of wish there was a tire shine option. The complimentary vacuums are quiet but reasonably strong. Recycling the wash water is a nice enviro touch. Haven't been into the cafe so I can't comment on the quality of the coffee or eye candy.

I'm really not much of a coffee drinker (stomach issues and hypertension don't play well with it), but my boss gifted the crew with $20 cards to Dutch Bros. Figured it was worth going one time just to check out.  Oh yeah. "First hit's free, kid."  On my first visit, the cashier went nuts with the loyalty card, stamp stamp stampity stamp. I've been to this store four times in the past two weeks and haven't paid for one drink yet, but that'll be changing right quick. I suppose if you're a coffee purist, you'll be disappointed or revolted. I've done the Caramelizer (twice), Double Torture, and White Mocha and Oh. Em. Gee. I can't imagine anyone comparing this place to (starts with S and rhymes with, uh, carsucks) and going with the latter. The java is smooth and doesn't taste like freakin' charcoal, and the employees all seem genuinely happy to be there. My new goal in life is to sample the entire menu, except for the Cocomo, because I hate coconut.

Nom. Nomnomnom. Also, NOM.  Moist brisket. Prime rib. Ribs, my gods, the RIBS. The sides - tater salad, banana pudding, peach cobbler - tasty little scoops of bliss.  Rudy's sause [sic] is amazing, but I find a little goes a long way. The other night I had the moist and babies; one cup of sause was enough. The dry rub is wonderfully savory.  Service has always been excellent, even when it's an obvious noob on the till. Being greeted by cute girls in tight jeans is a nice added bonus.  So much better than the place next door. So. Much.

I referred myself to Endo Associates, specifically, Dr Harari, based on their reviews on a site specifically for rating health care providers. And I'm damn glad I did.  Dr Harari is fantastic. On my first visit, he contradicted everything my previous endo said and did a much more thorough exam, which confirmed that my thyroid needed to come out immediately (multinodular goiter, 0.00 TSH). His manner is attentive and compassionate; he didn't blow off my symptoms, and he treats his assistants with respect. The ultrasound tech confided in me that everybody, patients and staff, loves him. It's easy to see why - he knows what he's doing and is very easy to deal with. Thanks to him, I got fast-tracked to have my cancerous thyroid removed, where my previous endo told me it was nothing to worry about (14cm across and 77g, nope, that's JUST FINE!). Following the surgery, he listened to my remaining concerns and laid out an action plan on the spot.  The rest of the practice is, AFAICT, just as competent. I have no problems scheduling appointments or getting immediate callbacks, and everybody I've talked to at the Chandler and Scottsdale offices is top-notch.   I absolutely and unreservedly recommend Endocrinology Associates, full stop.

Good eats. I got the Polish sampler with couscous and green salad. The pierogi were nicely crisp and perfectly seasoned, the cabbage roll delicious, and the sausage thick and chewy. Plenty of couscous for leftovers and the salad was crisp and lightly dressed. The takeout service was decently quick and there's plenty of parking. Definitely a winner.

I used to drop in here occasionally before it was China Jade. Nothing special, but not something to avoid either; just meh. Last week, I decided to check out the new place, and it's unrecognizable. The atmosphere is *way* nicer, the employees are friendly and polite (and totally willing to explain unusual menu items), and the food is amazing. I had the chow fun and was completely blown away. Definitely worth a return visit or three.

Nice shop, very clean and well organized. The staff appear to have their heads on straight, friendly and efficient. The military/LEO discount is very welcome for us broke-ass vets.  I dislike indoor ranges in general because I tend to own fairly blasty, hair-raising guns, but C2 is about as good as it gets on that score. The programmable target holders are neat and there's a good variety of targets. Ammo stock is sloooowly recovering from the hoarding shenanigans. Gun prices are on the high side, but accessories (holsters and that) are still reasonable.  Note to the whiners: Most shops ask you to unload or case your sidearm for a very good reason. That is, a fair number of gun owners are irresponsible jackasses who completely ignore the Four Rules, when they've heard of them at all. Someone blows a hole in his femoral artery while trying on AIWB holsters, he (or his next of kin) is gonna sue the crap out the shop. Sure, YOU aren't one of those idiots, but the shop owner and employees don't know that. Quit your bitching and play nice, and do your part to educate the ones who make the rest of us look bad.

Very nice, competent folks. I brought in a sweat-wicking skullcap to be resized. They completed it perfectly and on time; I paid as much for the tailoring as for the original cap, but it was worth it. Highly recommended.

When my Meetup group announced a Sunday brunch here, my first reaction was eye-rolling at the incredibly twee name*. I thought, well, maybe the food and atmosphere will make up for it.  Nope.  The food isn't *bad* as such. The menu is, uh, let's go with eclectic (because it sounds much more hip than "random"). The servers appeared to be genuinely enthusiastic about their job. However, it was LOUD as HELL. That plus the just meh food makes it unlikely I'll go back. Also, the silly-ass name.  *:"Didja know your restaurant name's an adverb?" -Lil Sheridan

MAs who can't take accurate blood pressure readings (if I'm really 160/100 on two different BP meds, I should probably be in cardiac ICU). Nurse practitioner who doesn't answer her phone or return VMs. Doctor who interrupts when I start to describe my symptoms. Redundant paperwork; really, is it that friggin' hard to use mail merge to copy patient info to multiple forms?  In fact, I don't know why I'm giving Chandler Endo two stars. Guess I'm feeling generous today.

I had RAIU done at Dobson Imaging earlier this week (Tuesday morning). The tech there said Chandler Endo would have my results by the end of the day. Today, *Friday*, Christine called at 1115 and left a message for me to call back before noon as the phones were being turned off for the weekend. I called at 1125 (which is, last I heard, before noon) and left a VM. And 1150. And 1155. 1156. 1157. 1158. Guess who never called me back.  If the practice is too busy to efficiently handle their patients, then they need to stop taking referrals and unf*ck their system. I'll be giving my GP an earful and demanding a referral to a different endocrinologist on Monday.  EDIT, 10 July: Dr Belitsky somehow missed that my thyroid is 3x larger than normal, crammed full of nodules, and producing no, as in  less than 0.01mg/dL, TSH. This is beyond malpractice and into butt-monkey incompetence. I've since transferred to Endocrinology Associates, who (whom?) I'll be reviewing later.

15 minutes to do a motorcycle T&R, friendly and competent. Well worth the convenience fee.
