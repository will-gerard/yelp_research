Lee Lee's is awesome! I didn't know I could find Goya products in the same place where I could buy everything I need to make my own sushi (not that I make my own sushi, but if I WANTED to...you catch my drift).   This huge supermarket is stocked with everything you can imagine. Exotic spices, meats, fish, noodles, veggies you can't find anyplace else, etc. I found bacalao here, something I was missing so much from the East Coast. As far as fish, there is yellowtail, seabass, catfish- you name it, they have it.   I advise to not go on a weekend as it gets really crowded. An early mid-week afternoon is perfect if you want to calmly browse each magical aisle. Their fruits and vegetables are massive in size. Their frozen section is packed with international goodies. It's basically a culinary dream. For those that love to cook, you need to shop at Lee Lee's.   Ask for the Lee Lee's 10% discount at the register.

This used to by my favorite spot to frequent when I moved to AZ. The music used to be great; the drinks used to be strong; the crowd used to be....well, a crowd.   Keywords here are USED TO BE.  I recently went back to Devil's to help my boyfriend on his event photography assignment, and I could not believe how pathetic it had become. It was empty, with only unfashionable, mid-50's patrons coming in for a cheap appetizer. The music is played out and repeats sometimes. The drinks are WEAK. It had a totally different feel to it..What is it called...BORING.  I'm more of a homebody now anyway, but in those rare occasions that I actually do want to pay for overpriced drinks and dance, I will avoid Devil's North like the plague.

I took my first class at Sweet Basil last night to learn how to make Thai food. I had such a great time; I didn't expect to have that much fun. The instructor was extremely knowledgeable and discussed each of the recipes before we were broken into groups of two people per recipe.   Cooking is one of my passions, and I am just so glad that I can feed that passion with more classes at this establishment. Some people have told me that I can get recipes online, and "why pay for the classes"? Well, it was worth every penny to be instructed by the chef, learn about the ingredients, see hands-on demonstrations of techniques, use their huge kitchen and utensils (without having to wash the dishes), meet new people who share a love of cooking, and then to finally sit down and taste everything for dinner with a glass of wine.   It was superb; an experience that has made me decide that I will be taking classes regularly at Sweet Basil.

Being Hispanic and having grown up eating authentic dishes, I can usually tell what's good Latin food and what's not. Havana Cafe doesn't even come close. I can make better food at home. Their pasteles were bland, as was their rice and their beans. The mojito was pretty good, but not worth being disappointed over the food. Wouldn't go back.

Last night my boyfriend brought home a pie from Barro's with mushrooms and onions...oh my!  I couldn't believe how good the pizza was. It was deep dish with a thick, soft crust and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. I was in carb lover's heaven. The onions were fresh and aromatic. I couldn't stop eating it. I even ate a slice after my body told me that I had had enough. As I sat there with a belly ache, I still smiled from having had what was the best pizza I've eaten in a long time.

I went to Carefree Station for the first time and had brunch. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, especially the outside tables which were very romantic. It was way too hot out to sit outside though so we sat inside, which was pleasant as well.   The wait staff is extremely attentive. We were seated with menus, and asked what we would like to drink within 1 minute of arriving. The menu is very eclectic, with fancy brunch options such as Crab Benedict, and Stuffed French Toast with strawberry cream cheese. I went for the crepes filled with mascarpone and ricotta cheese, covered in the cobbler for the day (peach). Dee-licious. Not to mention the complimentary champagne that gets re-filled when you're done. (Nice touch!)  My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito, which came with refried beans and potatoes. Of course, I had to sample his meal, and let me tell you...those potatoes were perfect. Just the right temperature so that I didn't scar the roof of my mouth; seasoned perfectly, and not too hard, not too soft. His burrito was good, but I wasn't in the mood for something so heavy so it didn't wow me.   I am definitely going back to try the Crab Benedict, and enjoy some more champagne. This place has managed to jump on my list of regular joints in one try.

Sapporo is one of my favorite sushi spots in town. Coming from NYC, I had my fair share of disappointing attempts at finding good sushi, but Sapporo actually has remained on the top of my list for AZ for the 4 years that I have been here.   As everyone knows, the crowd is pretentious and the music is too loud. Fine. You can avoid this by going from Sunday-Wednesday. The food is great. Their happy hour is pretty good, although they recently raised their pricing ($5 for a California roll during Happy Hour?Really?).  My favorite rolls include the shrimp tempura roll, Alaskan roll, and sautee roll (pricey but worth it- to me, at least). I used to adore their mango passion frozen martini until they started to serve them with less alcohol, thereby sacrificing the flavor and worth. The nigiri is great: fresh, big portions. The calamari is awesome with an addicting dipping sauce.   My advice is to check Sapporo out on their "off-days" so you can avoid the hustle and bustle of a crowd looking more TO fish than for fish. If you can handle not being able to hear the person with whom you're dining in exchange for really fresh sushi and good drink deals (50% off, plus 75 cents) then try it out. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

After being dragged here numerous times by a friend who, for some reason, loves PCL, I never changed my opinion about it:   Stink.Stank.Stunk.  Let's start with the whole "I've got claustrophobia" problem. I am not comfortable in small spaces. So, naturally, this ridiculousy tiny one-room "club" that lacks the normal required amount of space and oxygen was automatically uncomfortable for me. Add the fact that there is absolutely nowhere to sit unless you're "VIP" which, after people-watching for a few hours, obviously stands for Very Idiotic Patrons- and you have a horrid experience which is made worse by the snobby bartenders who ignore your pleading stares while they flirt with the other bartenders behind the bar that's brimming with increasingly hostile (and thirsty) customers.  The women are young, dumb, slutty and drunk. This, in turn, attracts the men who are painfully obvious about their mission to get laid; from their relentless staring down of every chick who passes by, to their over-gelled hair that looks like it will catch fire if too close to an open flame, or their look-at-me loudness at the VIP tables while they pour drinks and frequently scan the crowd to see if their desire to be watched is being fulfilled- it is just a train wreck.   The swing is available for drunken attention-whores to try to look sexy (but end up looking clumsy)  as they giggle maniacally with their fellow inebriated friends standing by. The lines to the bathrooms are long, and the floors of the bathroom are usually slippery from all the spilled drinks. Fun!  PCL is a mess. Period.  Harsh? Yes. True? Hell Yes. Ever Going Back? Hell to the Mother F'n No.

The first time I was taken to Maggiano's it was for the family-style dinner. It was REALLY good. And I couldn't believe that the dishes keep coming. It's a glutton's dream come true. I had the house salad, which was pretty good. The calamari is excellent, as are the pasta dishes. I didn't particularly care for the red clam sauce though.   This is THE place to go to if you want to take your family out for dinner, or even a group date night. The family-style dinner is very worth it, in my opinion. You get to take home what you dont finish, and it's usually a lot.   Ending on a sweet note: the cheesecake was the perfect ending to the meal.

I actually have grown to love this little place. Their coffee is good; their breakfast burritos are absolute heaven. Made with provolone cheese, these burritos have a more mellow and sophisticated taste than the average breakfast burrito you'll find drowned in yellow cheese.  You can get a Big Ass Burrito, or a Half Ass Burrito. Personally, I don't like to do anything "half-assed", so I opt for the Big Ass Burrito that, although adds circumference to MY big ass, is soooo worth it in the morning when you want a laid back spot to enjoy your meal and coffee (go for the iced).  They also have an art exhibit /sale right now for the month of September with awesome aviation pictures printed on canvas. Amazing art to enjoy as you sip your coffee.

This salon is clean and in a nice location, but after today's visit, I'm on the search for another place that doesn't argue with their customers when they're in the wrong. Their menu of services that is printed on their pamphlet has kid's pricing for children "Under 5 Feet". I brought my 14-year old (still considered a child, by the way) who is definitely under 5 feet, and they fought it. It wasn't that big of a deal to me (the difference between a regular pedicure and a kid's pedicure is literally $3-5. It's not gonna break the bank). The money isn't the point. The thing that irked me was that after I pointed it out on their menu, they continued talking about me in front of me and then asked my daughter how old she was, and then chose 13 years old as the cut off. That's fine. I got the regular pedicure for her. Only, some advice to this business: If you advertise something in print, maybe it's not a bad idea to honor it, or at least change it to avoid any confusion and awkward exchanges with your customers.

Hands down the strongest margarita I ever had in my life. Good when you're only having one and chatting it up with friends. Bad when you don't know when to stop and you find yourself stumbling to the bathroom, not knowing whether you want to throw up or order more guacamole (made in front of you at the table-delish with extra jalapenos- dirty look to those wusses I have gone with who have opted for less spice).   The ambiance is just right: dimly lit, comfortable booths (happy hour is only at the bar or at the tables surrounding the bar though), and friendly staff. The happy hour is great for the drinks. The HH appetizers, however, can be a little on the skimpy side, so go for an entree if you're famished. I made the mistake of getting the appetizer ceviche, which came with a few lonely anorexic shrimp that I wanted to feed instead of eat.   My favorite dish so far :The cilantro chicken salad (I subsitute steak for chicken, and ask for an extra little side of their amazing dressing).  Great for a date or just to meet with friends to gossip about dates. One of my regular spots that is worth trying out.

I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with Nee House. They treat me like shit but I keep coming back for more because their authentic dishes make me love them long time (inappropriate? Eh). I mean, it's never a shock when I come in and the staff makes me feel as if I just dropped into their home without calling first, but today they really turned me off with their rudeness.  I go in at about 2:45pm with my daughter for lunch. There is only one table being used. The woman points to the table right next to the only people eating at the restaurant. So, I smile but went one table over and sat down. The woman comes out of the kitchen and says "no, can you sit at that table over there?" I looked at her as if questioning why I couldn't sit at the table I had chosen, and she pointed to one of the large, family-style tables right next to the table I had chosen, and said "they're going to have dinner". I moved, but was very perplexed as to what the issue was. Aren't all the tables there for a reason? And who eats dinner at 3 in the afternoon? Anyway, I shook it off and ordered the shrimp and eggplant in Szechuan sauce; it was amazing, as usual. My daughter enjoyed her chicken lo mein. What I didn't love is how the waitress brought out one dish way before the other, and never acknowledged our numerous friendly "thank you's". She just had this energy that yelled "this is the last thing I want to be doing right now. Why are you here?!"  Then....the staff starts coming out of the kitchen to that table that I wasn't allowed to sit near. THAT'S why I couldn't sit there?! I guess I am a second-class citizen that cannot sit at my preferred table if it is too close to the staff as they eat their food. Totally turned me off. Ridiculous. And for those who claim "it's about the food, not the service", that is ridiculous too. When you eat out, the way you are treated as well as how delicious the food is contributes to your experience as a whole. Is the food good? Absolutely. Does this mean that it's a good experience? Probably not.   I vowed to never go back....at least until I get another craving for that shrimp dish-- with a side of jerk sauce.

My boyfriend took me here yesterday for lunch. Oh. My. God.  Two words: Pasta Giovani.  This dish was soooo freakin good. Pasta with chicken and sausage and mushrooms in this sauce that must be made from crack, because I could not stop eating it. It was absolutely delicious.  We shared the fried mozzarella appetizer. I expected a small square to be presented to us. Way off. For $5.95, we got a huge triangular serving of fried mozzarella with homemade sauce on top and parmesan cheese. It seriously was as big as a slice of pizza. And we loved it.   We also ordered the Mediterranean Salad, which was pretty good. Personally, I wanted to share the shrimp and calamari salad, but the boyfriend disagreed. I look forward to getting it at our next trip to Times Square.   Which will hopefully be soon. It quickly became a favorite after one bite. No lie.

This place holds a good memory for me only because it was where I had my first date with my boyfriend. That night was my first time eating at Sushi Brokers. It wasn't bad; wasn't great either.  Fast forward a year later (which should be an indication in itself as to how mediocre the food is)....We went again  for a quick snack. We decided to share an Alaskan roll, which, in my experience, is made with raw salmon, crab and avocado. Well, we got the roll and didn't eat more than 3 pieces. The salmon was actually cooked, and tasted too fishy.  Although they did redeem themselves by giving us another roll on the house for our dissatisfaction with the Alaskan roll, it completely ruined my view of this restaurant.  Moral of the story: Sapporo is way better and has better prices and is just around the corner. Go there instead.

Too expensive and not worth it. I was waiting for a pie when a man came in to pick up his order of two pies and some side dish. $50?? For some dough, sauce and cheese...really?   When I went home and ate the pizza, I was disappointed. It wasn't anything special.   Go to Barro's across the street. Much better.

When I discovered Red House, I just knew they had to be from the East Coast. I asked them and, sure enough, they said they are from Flushing, Queens. I grew up in Queens and have sorely missed the REAL New York Chinese take-out spots that actually have different sizes to choose from when it comes to certain dishes, as well as the distinct flavor of these dishes.  The eggrolls are just like home! The staff is quick, just like in New York. And the brown sauce is excellent. I have had their shrimp with broccoli in garlic sauce and was very happy with it. I have had their wonton soup, which was excellent. I have had their chicken chow fun which was exactly like I remembered from back East.   Red House is a little slice of New York in Scottsdale. Very rare and very good.

I went here unexpectedly one night with my boyfriend and his family. I ordered the chopped salad, which was delicious. You wouldn't think there could be anything special about a chopped salad but the ingredients were just really fresh, and there was the perfect amount of dressing. I got to taste a bit of someone's calamari. OUTSTANDING. Lightly breaded, fresh and seasoned to perfection. I could not get over how good it was, and kept saying it was the best calamari I've ever had. The fried green tomatoes were okay, as the bacon sauce that was on top of it was a bit too sweet for my tastes. My boyfriend loved it though. We were pretty impressed.  So...we went back for our cheat meal the next week (just me and the boyfriend). We went all out, sampling several appetizers first. The mac and cheese was very good but I wouldn't get it again- too rich. The calamari was still great. The pork and beans were amazing in their cream sauce and cilantro. My entree was the filet mignon, which was sooooo good. Very tender and well-seasoned. I regretted eating so much of the appetizers because i was starting to get full. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips, which I think he regretted. It was okay but too greasy, and we were wondering what the big deal was about the fries. Anyway, dessert made up for it. The donuts served with a few different sauces. We saved some for the next morning, and they were great with our coffee. We will definitely be back to try more dishes. The services is always great, and the atmosphere is romantic with a great view.

Love love love Thai House.  My 8-year old daughter begs to eat here often, which speaks volumes since she is THE pickiest eater I know. Her favorite is the Pad See Ew (chicken with wide flat noodles and veggies). Very flavorful. I like spice, so when I order mine I get a "5", which is supposed to be the spiciest on their scale from 1-5, but it usually not spicy enough. That's fine though, I just tell them to make it extra spicy and then I am happy while I am coughing and tearing and gasping for air and water.   The service is extremely fast and friendly. This place is always packed during lunch hours, especially during the work week. They are closed on Sundays (boo hoo). Their pricing is decent, especially the lunch specials, which come with your choice of white or fried rice, and a soup or salad. Everytime I have come to the Thai House I have loved it, and have gotten my meal within 5 minutes.

Bryan's BBQ is tucked away in the cute little town of Cave Creek, luckily up the block from my daughter's new school. It is so hard NOT to stop in for dinner everytime I pick her up. Lately it has been a frequent go-to spot for the family when we are too tired to make dinner, or when we want to indulge in the best BBQ we've ever had. The week wouldn't be complete without eating at Bryan's at least once. AT LEAST.  I always get the pulled pork sandwich which has just the right amount of spice and flavor. I always add a little spicy BBQ sauce for that extra kick. The bun is slightly toasted and the edges have that little crunch, while the middle of the bun is soft from the moisture of the pulled pork.  Their fries are addicting, and served as a side in generous heaps with the perfect amount of salt. Their cole slaw has sliced olives- both black and green- which give it a very pleasant and interesting twist. I have yet to try their ribs, because when I find something I like, I stick to it. But after reading some reviews on here I see that it's a must.   Oh, and you get a free soft drink if you wear a funny hat on Fridays. Not that the place needs to offer this for me to keep coming back. The BBQ is treat enough.

So I go into Basha's to grab a couple of coffees before my daughter's soccer game one Saturday morning. First of all, I think it is extremely tacky to be handed a cup and told to "walk over to the ice machine and fill the cup up with ice". Excuse me?? I didn't think ordering coffee was a team-building effort. So, after a brief pause of disbelief, I took the cup and walked over to the soda machine (which was filthy, by the way) and got ice. The woman put so much cream into the iced coffee that it was literally white.   On to my cafe mocha. Not hot enough and it tasted like it was regurgitated. The credit card swiper that I used was also filthy. It had crumbs on the the sticky and stained screen. I left feeling pissed, unsatisfied & longing for Starbucks. Never again.

I went to Big Earl's yesterday because, unfortunately, Bryan's BBQ across the street was closed. My daughter ordered the kid's meal chicken fingers with fries and a drink. I ordered the kid's meal grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and a drink.  The girl behind the counter is very friendly, yes. But that doesn't change the fact that they use styrofoam cups (step it up for the environment!), or that the sweet potato fries were dry and stale, or that the grilled cheese had maybe one slice of cheese for the whole sandwich and was a bit burned.   My daughter could not eat because she was so appalled at all the different types of flies crawling on the windows (inside). She is 8 years old, and said "Mom, this place is disgusting. They don't even clean the floors, and there are crumbs inbetween the seats here". I think that says it all when a child can see how filthy a place is. One fly landed on her little cup of ketchup...ON the ketchup. (Shuddering at the memory).  For me to like a place, it has to be free of insects crawling inches from my food, or even ON my food. I have had better fries at fast food joints, which is sad. And, furthermore, my daughter refuses to go back.  Not good.

My boss took me out to lunch here once, and I was very pleasantly surprised at the flavor and price of the lunch specials. Mostly everything I have tried at Tandoori Times has been good. The naan is so fresh and warm, and when you request spicy, that's what you get. Enter the mango lassi, which is really good. It helps cool your mouth when you're eating something fiery.  The only thing I have a complaint about are the tandoori appetizer wings, as there was less meat on them than I have seen on any chicken wing, plus it was WAY too spicy. I also felt like $10 was way too much to ask when you have to basically get your nutrition from the dish by sucking on bones. But, hey...who am I to judge, right? Had they toned the flavor just a bit on that dish, I might have given it another try. However, bleeding from my esophagus is not how I'd like to spend my lunch hour.   Aside from the wings from hell, I love Tandoori Times. It is authentic, affordable and right around the corner from my job. 4 stars.

On the way to this restaurant, my 8-year daughter had asked what "notorious" means. I explained that it means something along the lines of being famous for being bad. Little did I know, Notorious P.I.G. would definitely live up to its name. Never again.  My boyfriend, daughter and I were excited to discover a BBQ joint near our house. My daughter got the sliders and mashed potatoes with gravy. The sliders (from the kid's menu) were inedible. I almost got annoyed at my daughter for being too picky...until I took a taste for myself. The brisket slider tasted horrible; it was like chewing on burnt rubber. The pork slider was way too spicy for a child. The mashed potatoes were watery.  I ordered the pulled pork with a side of mashed and Texas Toast. Okay, so first of all, if I'm going to a restaurant, I expect the Texas Toast to taste better than those from the frozen food section in the supermarket. Uh, yeah...no. The "Texas Toast" from this restaurant is just regular toasted white bread with no taste. I had to put butter on it just so it would taste like something. The pulled pork was the most bland bbq pork I have ever had in my life. I left half of it on the plate, even in my hungry state. Very disappointing,  One thing that was good was the cookie sundae. They made the cookie fresh. We all shared it and thought it was great. But maybe that was because we were starving from having left behind half of our dinners.   Do NOT waste your time or money on this place. It is Notoriously B.A.D.

I was excited to try this place out, and probably would have kept going back IF it weren't for my recent call to the owner regarding my expired Groupon. My Groupon, for which I paid $15, expired just THREE days ago. I called the owner, Michy, and kindly asked if she would still honor the Groupon.  My experience went like this:  Michy: Desert Dragon Pottery... Me: Hi, I'm calling because I had purchased a Groupon, and--{she cuts me off mid-sentence} Michy: Ok can you hold on? Me: Sure.  (4 minutes on hold)  I hung up and called back: Michy: I'm sorry. I was on hold with someone else, and then I forgot about you. Can I call you back? Me: Sure.  She calls me back and finally I get to ask about the expired Groupon. She proceeded to tell me that I couldn't use it, but that I could get 10% off a class. Uh, no thank you. She, as the owner, had no reason to deny this request. It was 3 days ago that this expired. This shows a lack of flexibility and understanding, and a lot of greed in my opinion. For all she knows, I could have loved the class (which I paid for), and kept returning, or told all my friends about it, giving her more business.  So instead, I'm yelping about it. Some people may think I am wrong to be put off by this but I think it was ridiculous for her not to honor my purchase, as well as suggesting I pay more money to this establishment for a class. 10% off. Whatever. The way I see it, I paid $15 to discover another business not worth another glance.

You know if I'm driving 45 minutes for a sandwich, the food has got to be amazing. This place has become my regular go-to spot for authentic Puerto Rican food. My favorites are the Cuban sandwich, tostones (fried plantains), pasteles and rice and beans. You can't go wrong with anything; it all has such great flavor. Very reasonably priced as well.   Bring cash as they don't accept cards--- and you're welcome.

I just recently tried Tryst Café and was very pleasantly surprised! I got the Hawaiian breakfast (pork, cabbage, two eggs, and I subbed sweet potato tots for the jasmine rice). SO delicious. The restaurant is clean, the wait staff is friendly and the service is great.  I went in today for the second time and ordered the same dish which did not disappoint. When I tried paying, their credit card system was glitching so I waited a little while for them to figure it out. They provided a $10 gift card for the inconvenience, which was totally unnecessary but extremely thoughtful. I will be back to try something on their dinner menu.

I went back to iPic after I was contacted about my last review (I apologize for taking so long to write this). Even though I had no issue with the theater (it was the service at Salt that really rubbed us the wrong way), iPic offered an apology, two movie tickets and a $100 credit to use food and drink. We went back and didn't eat at the lounge but, instead, went straight to the theater and ordered dinner, drinks and dessert to enjoy throughout the movie. It more than made up for our bad experience. We had a great dinner with exceptional service and loved the reclining seats with popcorn and a blanket. I will definitely be coming back to treat my sister when she visits from New York in a few weeks.   Thanks for making up for everything and we will be back!    __________________________________________________________________  Finally went to the IPic Theater last weekend! We bought our tickets and had 40 minutes before the movie started so we sat down at the bar in the Salt Lounge to grab dinner. We ordered from the prefixe menu, which looked like a great deal: appetizer, entree and dessert for $22. After 30 minutes, we asked if we could have the food delivered to the theater since the movie was about to start. Well, at that point, one entree arrived (yes, before the appetizers). My boyfriend started eating it at the bar since that is where the waiter placed it. He thought it tasted great (BBQ Chicken Flatbread). My sliders came out shortly after. Before I had a chance to dig in, we were told not to sign the credit card receipt as the food was on the house since we waited 30 minutes for it. This was great and VERY much appreciated. We only paid for our two drinks. Then I started eating...the sliders were cold. The mozzarella sticks were cold and not even melted. We were famished so we ate it anyway, hurrying so we could catch the movie.   Finally we realized we would have to move whatever food was left to the theater, and we asked for assistance in doing so. After 7 minutes, a waiter finally came over but didn't have a big enough tray so he left to get one. 4 minutes later, he arrived with the tray and an apology. I put the silverware on the tray which must have been taken off at some point because when we finally sat down in our seats at the theater, we had to eat our cheesecake slices with our fingers- no utensils. Yes, we could have gotten up, left and missed more of the movie while annoying the other moviegoers, but after the whole experience we decided to just stay put.   Again, credit to the manager who removed the food from the bill but it still caused us to miss the beginning of the movie, eat cold food and leave wondering what the big deal was about IPic and Salt.

This is our go to place for Thai and/or cheat night. They are always very friendly and have the best lunch specials. Their chicken noodle dish is amazing, as is their Thai iced tea, which isn't overly sweet as I've experienced in other places. My daughter asked to try their chicken wings, which I was hesitant to order but they were REALLY good. They were pretty large with just the right amount of seasoning- and not spicy at all...good for kids. Their panang curry is rich and delicious. They always sub extra vegetables for rice when I wish to steer clear of starchy carbs. I have yet to venture to other entrees on the menu but I will get to it. As should you!

Faith does an amazing job, and is a perfectionist when it comes to her work. I got my lashes done with her recently, and walked out feeling like every other person who did my lashes had no idea what they were doing. Faith managed to make my short lashes look amazing without the feel of glue or crunchiness. They felt light and natural. Can't wait to go back to indulge in her other services!
