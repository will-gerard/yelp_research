I have been with Southwest since 2004, when it was just Southwest Women's Care. I was new to AZ and in the ER with complications when one of the staff referred me to the group. Being a high risk patient, they were amazing to us. When I was admitted to Banner Desert, Dr. Balk and Dr. Grayson took the time to talk to me and make me feel as comfortable as they could. Dr. Grayson delivered my daughter prematurely but he and the staff were very supportive and my C-section scar was minimal. Dr. Grayson's surgical technique and the practices attitude is what brought me back when I needed a hysterectomy. Again, the group went above and beyond my expectations during this difficult phase, especially since the OBYGN I had seen closer to my house was completely unprofessional and did not explain my diagnosis, even passing it off as nothing to worry about. Dr Grayson's surgical skill, plus his demeanor, excelled at not only giving me minimal scarring (again) but was patient and even a little joking with me when I pulled an "Exorcist" moment coming out from anesthesia.  The care I received at Southwest was head and shoulders above other care I had experienced, both during my pregnancy and hysterectomy. I am still a patient and recommend others to Southwest as well.

Unfortunately, there was nothing especially outstanding or extraordinary about this place. The egg batter for the chile relleno was literally egg covering the relleno. The machaca was shredded beef, a bit on the salty side, and the serving too small for the corn tortilla it was delivered in as a taco.  My companion and I started to notice this metallic, penny taste in our mouths after eating what we could find palatable. We don't know if it's from the iced tea, tap water or something else. But I will say it is a persistent aftertaste that only brushing, twice, seems to have remedied.   There were some older Canadian folks who seemed to enjoy it and the food is almost geared toward that crowd. I grew up with Tex-Mex and the food is a weird play on this type of style. It wasn't for my taste but others may find it agreeable. Like those who have never had Mexican food.

I have been to my share of Phó places in the Valley but this is one of the best outside of California.  You can always judge a restaurant by it's clientele and this one had a range of ages and ethnicities. When you see an older executive sitting next to a large family of Vietnamese who are sitting next to college kids and business professionals, you know it has to be good.  The shrimp spring roll was good, the Phó was excellent and the Thai tea was okay. I think out of our meal the tea was the only part lacking. I will definitely come back for lunch again!

We ordered the salmon bomber and the crazy roller coaster roll on our first visit. If you love the taste of super strong seaweed wrap with the taste of cold crab mix inside of a baked roll, these are the rolls for you! The only difference between the two rolls is the crazy roller coaster has tempura shrimp in the middle of it and is missing a sauce that is on the salmon bomber. Otherwise, this is the same roll.   Word to the wise: Be careful when you order the cucumber roll. If you don't say Cucumber Fiesta Rolla they will bring out a roll filled with cucumber. Of course it may have just been our punishment for sending back the two baked rolls I mentioned earlier. Go team.

Baci's  is a great Italian restaurant with a friendly atmosphere,  relaxed eating and the best marinara in the valley. Our favorite appetizer is the pizza bread, standard go to is eggplant parmigiano and lasagna and we always have food for the next day.

Today, I walk into the dealership with my own financing and a smile on my face because it's my birthday, I found a great deal online for a Pathfinder and I have my Costco Auto benefits. Killer combo right?? Plus I have found a great car. I tell the salesman I want the numbers worked first to know that a deal can be done before we do anything. I'm asked where do I want the numbers to be, I'm a realist (mid-30's), and off they go. I also tell them I'm on a timetable bc I have to pick my daughter up from school. I'm asked when the numbers are done, when can I be back and I say "tonight between 5-7". After we left, we hadn't heard anything for a few hours and we called back; I'm told my deal has to be done at $37,000 for it to work and that I have to come in for it to completed since i am not in the dealership. So the family gets back in the car and off we go on a 40 min drive to Nissan to finish up the deal on the Pathfinder so I can have a great rest of my birthday. I walk in, they get the official payoff and then he sits down. "I'm sorry; I thought if I got you in here they would give me more attention but the manager that was working your deal left for the day and the new manager says the deal isn't even possible. We'll give you $16K for your car but your loan will need to be $47K". ARE YOU KIDDING ME??   On my birthday, you lied to me, brought my to the dealership on the pretense the deal was closing at $37K, told me the car which was sold me less than a year before is only worth $16K when I signed the damn loan at $30K and you're sorry because the finance manager who was working the deal decided that because we left to pick up my daughter we weren't worth his time? Never have I ever felt so used, cheated and hurt. I'm a grown adult almost running out of a dealership because I don't want anyone to see me cry. But you want to give me $30 for my time like I'm a circus attraction on my birthday. Thanks LHM.

This is one of my favorite places to have reflexology performed. The place is always clean, the owner is personable and the staff competent. I like having my feet washed and pampered before the service is started.   The only downside is not having my feet and legs focused on more. I'm glad they want to do my back but sometimes I really am there for reflexology only. But I think that is more a communication issue from me to them.   Other than my personal preference for my feet to have more attention, this place is really awesome! They are great at handling kids (my 10 yo would go too) and we are all placed in the same room, right next to each other. I would definitely recommend this shop!!

This shop is a mixed bag of broken machines and not having the ingredients in stock. I'm at the store right now and the open sign is off even though they don't close for another 1.5 hours. I've been here multiple times when I've had the hit or miss luck or getting what I want or having to order only what they have available. If there was another juice shop close, I would be there instead. No dice there though.

Want some of the best street tacos outside of Mexico and SoCal? You definitely have to try this place. This is a lunchtime regular for my coworkers and I and we always leave happy and full. The only downside is the size of the interior dining but even that is worth the trip to eat here! Favs: red chili beef and carve asada with the hot salsa.

The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the fried okra and the baked potato casserole. The meat was a no go from the minute I saw the guy scraping the bark and the fat off my request for wet (or moist) brisket. The pulled pork was a weird mix of dry and mushy meat. The ribs were super salty and not very good.  But before all that was the service that was SO SLOW!! I think I got two new gray hairs just waiting for him to pull out the meat we wanted. Needless to say we won't be going back. If I want good bbq, I apparently need a plane ticket home to the South.

I was a little skeptical but this place is always hopping. The portions are huge so be prepared to eat. The smoked Cajun wings are the best in house, IMO. The smoked wings almost melt in your mouth they are so good. I haven't tried much outside of the wings but Smoke Wings + Mermaid Red from Coronado, CA equal deliciousness!!

I normally come here when I can't get in to see the doctor or I'm really ill. Every time I came  previously I had a good experience. This time, not so much. I'm the only one sitting in the lobby and the guy who came in after me has come and gone. The receptionist was a complete bitch and didn't like that I would not sign a paper stating I have High Deductible HSA insurance. Since my insurance isn't an HSA or High Deductible, I refused; then was told if I want to be seen I had to sign it or leave. So I'm sitting here and waiting for a nurse or doctor when there are no other patients waiting, forced to have signed a paper I didn't or should have had to sign.

This place is to die for! The Duck Cuban is amazing, the  Banana Foster is heavenly and the atmosphere is totally chill. I've tried about 3 different savory crepes and there doesn't seem to a subpar dish in this place. This is another fantastic diner with a small inside dining area so get there early! You won't regret it!

The lunch buffet is phenomenal here. I'm very picky about Indian food and this place was great. The fritters were a great alternative to the rice (which fills me up really quick ), the Naan was fresh and the curries were so good. The goat curry is actually one of the most flavorful I have found so far. I am looking forward to eating here again.

This is the best spot for sashimi and rolls. You cannot go wrong with the Lovers roll and the Lollipop roll. The cucumber wrap on the lollipop is refreshing on a hot day and the environment is completely laid back. We love coming here for for these two rolls and the small sashimi platter. Yum!

First time here and this place could do no wrong. We had the Tide and Gumbo steam pots along with the oysters and it was all delicious. The homemade hot sauce was so good and was great on the oysters. I put it in my Bloody Mary, which was the best decision I made today. My only complaint: I couldn't finish and I really wanted too! Try this out and you won't regret it.

Update: Came here for Fathers Day and tried the new Summer Happy Hour menu.   Fantastic: The food was good and (warning) the Lobster Mac and Cheese is enough to share with 3 people. The calamari comes out in sticks, not rings, and the chicken wings were good as well. I'm a super fan of their homemade hot sauces and the honey hot was just as great as the house hot sauce. The Eastern oysters are meaty (!!) so be prepared to chew!   Downside: I grew up in the South and when I see anything Cajun, it has to be tasted. It was a good broth but not a Cajun shrimp boil as advertised.   Still good and still my fav!    First time here and this place could do no wrong.

I took my husband here for a pre-Fathers Day dinner and we walked in to find we were the only non-Indian family in the restaurant.  Bonus!! This is a true vegetarian Indian restaurant with so many great items. The vegetable vindaloo was amazing and the garlic Naan was to die for. The different curries, soups and sauces were equally as fabulous. The staff was incredibly helpful and so personable. Our family walked out talking about how full they were and we had boxes to take home. Definite go to in the future.

I never thought I would say this about a "fast food" place but this is one of the better places I've been. The chicken panang,  medium hot,  was awesome. Lots of flavor, enough liquid for all of my rice and perfect heat. The kids loved the Thai fried rice with tofu and beef and the man dug the spicy eggplant. I will say the Tom Yum gai was lacking in both flavor and heat.   This is a definite go to spot for Thai in QC. :)

Gluten free crust, white sauce, awesome and unique veggies, fresh herbs and seasonings and a wood fired stove makes this the best pizza place I have ever been! I loved the fact I could put mushrooms, roasted garlic and jalapeños on top of my artichoke hearts and brussel sprouts. The caramelized pear tea tastes just like Teavana's honeybush tea and was a definite plus to the meal.   The fact you can pay one price for your pizza (I got a mini and was full 3/4 of the way through) and put as many toppings on there as you want is an awesome business model and works great when you have a growing athlete. We can't wait to come back!

I am updating my review because I had a complaint about discovering the gluten-free crust I thought I was getting with the mini ONLY comes in a mod size and there was nothing listed  in the store.   The company reached out and we were able to have a great dialogue about the gluten free option. It is still a great place to eat My family still eats there but now I get to take pizza home to eat! Bonus!
