This place has the weirdest fish tacos I've ever had... they were good.  The grilled cod was ground up and mixed with cilantro and green onions (kind of like taco meat). It was well spiced and pretty good.  Other than that, the most remarkable thing about this place is how long it has survived downtown. It's fine in a pinch, but definitely not a destination.

Sea of Cortez style Mexican food. Doesn't get much better than this.  The Shrimp Cuilici (sp) is the signature dish and the item I order the most. It consists of shrimp baked in a creamy pepper sauce with a layer of cheese. It all blends together in a gooey goodness that you can spoon over tortillas.  All the seafood is awesome there, cooked in several styles. I love Mexican food and I love seafood. San Carlos Bay is the best of both worlds.

The design is great, the drinks strong and the best hummus in town, bar none.  I've been there for brunch, lunch and diner. The food is always good and the atmosphere really works  Here's my favorites: Brunch-definitely the eggs benedict and a bloody Stella (tomato juice and Stella Artois); Lunch-the Tangier burger is the best, with hummus, pesto spread and sun-dried tomatoes; Dinner-the tomato Taza salad with a side of grilled salmon.  Also check out the kisras with shrimp or lamb and, oh yeah... did I mention the best hummus in town?

I've lived downtown for 5 years now and never heard of this place until I saw it on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'...  Just kidding. I'm a semi-regular. I say "semi" because I go in series. I'll go four or five times in a two week period and then have to lay off and hit the gym to work off the 20 pounds I gained. But I keep going back.  Matt uses a lot of butter when he cooks, which makes everything taste better. The fresh made pancakes and waffles are awesome with real maple syrup. The pork chop and eggs is a delightfully dangerous breakfast, marinated in a homemade pesto sauce (the porkchop, that is - who marinates eggs?). The thick cut bacon strips are great for breakfast and even better in the BLT (which I sometimes order with a fried egg on it for breakfast, a BELT).  It looks as though most people are saying this is a '$' place but I would give it '$$'. I have yet to leave there with a bill under $10.  Some complain about the wait but I have and answer for that - don't go if you're in a hurry. If you go on a weekend, bring an iPod or something to read while you're waiting.

This place is definitely my favorite coffee shop in town.  I don't subscribe to belief that cool coffee shops have to be dark, moody places. Copper Star is bright, open and airy. The renovation of the old gas station was pulled off masterfully by updating the building while still keeping the old service station feel.  They serve pastries, sandwiches, smoothies, sodas and... oh yeah, coffee drinks.  The owner, Bill, is one of the friendliest guys you'll ever meet.   The free WiFi makes it a great place to work and hang out.

With the sushi wave cresting I was beginning to wonder if anyone in this town knew that there was more to Japanese cuisine than sushi. With restaurants like Ippei and Taneko Tavern failing, the choices for Japanese dining beyond sushi were scarce. Enter Roka Akor.  So much to talk about, I'll just hit the highlights. First, the design of the restaurant is amazing. Very contemporary with just the right touch of modern Japanese influence. The Shochu Lounge rocks. The sake selection is extensive and the shochu drinks are inventive thanks to master mixologist Carson Quinn.  A friendly staff serves the exceptionally prepared food with as much attention to presentation as mouth-watering flavors. Some of the menu's highlights include the Butterfish Tataki, Black Cod and the spectacularly large Madagascar Prawn. In addition to the grilled delights, the selection of sushi and sashimi is unique with inventive combinations like the Age Watari Gani roll featuring soft-shell crab, cucumber, kimchi and chili mayonnaise.

Normally, I would give this place 3 or 4 stars but there were some issues last time I was there.  I was with a group watching the election results (at a British Pub, of course). Service was incredibly slow. Not the server's fault, I think he was the only one. He was nice but I never actually got to order food. The first three beers I wanted were not available. What kind of British Pub runs out of Boddington? I guess we were lucky they had Guinness.  It could be a very cool neighborhood bar, but with places like The Lost Leaf, The Roosevelt, etc., they need to step it up if they want to make it.

Oh yeah. This place rocks! Definitely authentic. I felt very pressured to order in that New York nice kind of way.  As a frequent NY traveler (just read my other reviews) it felt every bit like I was in a New York deli, except there was room to move around and not a lot of people talking very loudly.  The subs are huge, fresh and tasty. I am definitely planning on sampling as much from the menu as I can. So far, I would say this is the best sandwich shop in town.

I've been meaning to go to Sushi Roku for a while now and finally got the chance.  For starters, I'm less about the sushi and more about the fish. Don't get me wrong, I love a good rainbow roll but sashimi is the main event.  I had the chef's sashimi sampler and I have never had fresher fish in Phoenix. The blue fin had a perfectly delicate flavor while melting in my mouth. I'm usually not a huge fan of uni, but it was so fresh, I had to finish every last bite. The blue fin special with truffles (definitely not to be confused with a blue light special, mostly because of the truffles) was the perfect starter.  I was planning on going for a drink and a couple of small appetizers and ended up eating a full meal (I am powerless against the rainbow roll, especially after a few drinks of saki).  The place looks great. It is clean and well designed. The staff was also excellent with just the right amount of attention without being bothersome.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.
