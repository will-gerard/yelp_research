This was our first visit to this resort and upon arrival, we were greeted by super friendly guys at valet (which is complimentary for the entire stay). We got a deal on travel zoo for a one night stay in a casita, two cocktails, a $25 food credit and and $50 spa credit.  The resort grounds are truly beautiful. You almost forget you're in Phoenix; all the plants and flowers are so lush and green. The room was cozy with a large 4 poster bed. The room had a Kuerig machine which was nice to have, even though we didn't get a chance to use it. The shower was large and the room was really clean.  The resort is a destination earth property and very Eco conscious which I liked. The resort also includes a daily resort fee so that way you don't feel obligated to tip at every turn.  All the staff were extremely polite.  The only issues I had was with the spa and room service. The $50 spa credit could only be used on a 50 minute service. I really wanted a pedicure and we were gonna pay out of pocket for a second pedicure so we could do it like a couples treatment but it wasn't an option. Also, it was 40+ for breakfast for the equivalent of a Denny's grand slam breakfast and it didn't come with any juice or anything just water.  The resort fee does allow you access to the fitness center, pool, hot tub and into the spa to use the showers and eucalyptus steam room which was so refreshing and relaxing.

I normally really enjoy eating here but this last experience bothered me. I went for lunch with my sister and son. My sister and I got an app to share and were going to split a lunch entree. My son only wanted a cheese crisp and the kids combo (which isn't much of a combo only one side and no drink included) was 4.75 and when I asked the price for just a Kids cheese crisp the waiter said it was going to 5.95. He said that there is no option to have the kids crisp by itself, they give you the adult size app crisp instead and charge full price. It's only a dollar difference but still, less food for more money.

I have been to Treasures several times for he cleaning and repair of my wedding set. They are friendly and fast and honest. I never feel like I'm being upsold or charged for anything I don't need. After the jeweler I bought my wedding band went out of business I found Treasures on Yelp and am really glad I did.

This is our second time here and although our two boys were excited, there were aspects I was less than thrilled with.  First of all they charge the parents full price for an unlimited band and there are very few rides a parent even needs to go on. Secondly, all the employees looked miserable and had snappy tones in their voices. I understand that doing this job may be frustrating at times because it's redundant and you're dealing with other people kids but hey, that's the job. Thirdly the bumper boats were a huge let down. All they did was go around in a circle...they were so much so the opposite of boats that the attendant was knee deep in the water dragging the boats around so the kids could experience some sort of aquatic experience.   On a positive note the weather was nice and the kids don't fully comprehend how less than stellar the quality of the rides are.

This was our first visit to Donovan's after hearing good things for quite awhile about it . We had a 530 dinner reservation, complimentary valet parking was nice. The atmosphere inside is very versatile; it's relaxed enough for a business dinner or casual meal but can also be romantic seated in one of the cozy booths. The service really was wonderful. They were friendly, attentive, informative without being pushy. What I really liked was that they included sides in the price of the entree and a lot of higher end steakhouses do not. Food was delicious and it was an overall good experience.

It's like a whole new place in here. I didn't realize it'd been that long since we were here last but the restaurant went through a remodel...it's really nice. It's almost a little too nice where I feel like it might not be casual enough to bring my kids too.   There was a 30 min wait when we came at 630 on a Saturday, so not completely unexpected. What was unexpected was how long it took to get our appetizer..again 30 mins..it got a little worrisome with two hungry boys. Our server Dynelle was apologetic about the wait and even though we put the kids order in right away, it still took quite awhile.  As for the food, I had the royal red robin and it was a royal mess! The taste of the burger was good but it completely fell apart after two bites and I ate it in pieces. We also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and there was hardly any chicken in it.  I can handle long waits, taking a long time to fill our order, and the quality of the food but the one thing that really bothered me about our visit tonight was that the arrangement of the dining room made it so difficult for the servers to get through the aisle that twice they almost knocked into our daughter in the highchair on the end. The new big chairs for the long tables took up so much space in the aisle that the servers had a  such a hard time navigating around them when they carrying the big trays.   I'm kinda remembering now why we haven't been in recently... You just don't get the same service or quality of food you used to a few years back

I'm really bummed that Carl's jr is starting to skimp on the food. The chicken sandwich has shrunk and the sandwich was 90% lettuce and the large fry was hardly a medium when dumped out. Also Carl's jr has a new rewards app and you get rewards for checking in and the location was selected but said it didn't recognize any Location nearby. I asked the person at the register to help me and she said "I didn't know we had an app" and the other person said "it's having problems". They did even offer to honor the initial register/check in offer

I love coming to Pink. The atmosphere is so comfortable and all of the instructors are down to earth, strong, confident women and they make everyone feel welcome. I've done several of the classes but the pole aerobics is my favorite. It's a killer workout and it's so fun. The studio just recently moved and they are still getting settled but it doesn't take away from the point of the visit; getting your booty kicked (and popped )

I found true hot yoga on groupon (great deal!) and was excited to try it. My sister and I went to the Saturday morning class and Kay was teaching. The class was very full. The 80 min long class was incredible. There was all fitness levels there practicing, the music was appropriate, and the sweat was just pouring out of everyone! There is not a lot of tolerance for talking in class so if you go with a friend you'll have to be super quiet or save it for afterwards. The studio was nice and I can't wait to use the rest of my classes.

I had never been to this school before but had a coupon from savvy shopper for $16 color so I figured I'd give it a try. The haircut was only $8. My stylist was Francesca and she was really nice and chatty which I like in a stylist. She was attentive, asked what I wanted with my color and cut and made sure before I left that I was totally happy with it. I like going to the schools not only because its cheaper but because I'm OCD and like having more than one person checking to make sure it's supposed go the way I want for the end result. Good location, easy to find. The appointment process was easy and they had some really good check out deals for the next time I book.

I went on a Monday, mid morning, to clean some heavy duty items (like couch pillows). I had seen a previous review talking about the large capacity machines so I thought is try them out.  A lot of the regular machines were out of order.   There were only 2 of the washers there and once I out my money in and my soap, the machine wouldn't start, so the lady there had to help me switch machines. The attendant was very helpful the entire time I was there. I'm not a big fan of the money card to work the machines, plus the card machine charges you 50 cents for a new card purchase.  There were benches and chairs and the place has free wifi. The bathroom wasn't working and there no TVs or music, so come with your phone charged or a book or something.  Also, the carts don't go outside so you gotta be organized bringing your stuff and out.  Large machine is 7.15 a load, the medium machine was 5.99 and the dryers were 70 cents for a 20 min dry cycle.

This is the first time I've eaten here. We had a gift card and thought we'd try it out.  It's really nice inside, clean, and the atmosphere is good. It can be for a date, business meeting, family dinner or celebration.  We got the pretzel sticks with the beer cheese for an app and it was super tasty! Our waiter Todd was really nice and really attentive. He exemplified great service! We ordered our steak medium and it came more like well done so we sent it back and they made us a new one really quickly and it was flavorful and delicious (they also comp'ed it from the tab which was incredibly surprising, unexpected). The portions are a good size, enough for us to share.  We ordered dessert but were too full to eat it and took it to go.  Overall positive experience. Definitely will return.

We came here one morning on our spring break. The people were so friendly and the place quiet and clean.  We came on the morning where they were doing a 2 donut and milk special. We got 6 donuts for us and kids.  We got a few of the specialty donuts, including the maple bacon, the carmel delight and the sweet and salty. They were really warm and yummy. We got a raspberry inside out filled and it was good but messy.

First time here. The line was almost out the door when we got here but it moved pretty quickly. The menu has a good variety and it pretty reasonably priced. It was nice to see how many salad topping options there were. You get Italian soda mix ins with your fountain drinks and that was fun to play around with. There were some really delicious looking desserts but we didn't get any (this time, but next time...). You get a chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal too. The food was pretty good, fresh and light.  They have rolling booted seats/car seat holders and long tables for families. We sat in a booth and had our car seat in one of the holders and felt really in the way from the people squeezing to get by.

I found sumits on groupon (really good deal) and I was really impressed. The studio has a great atmosphere and the instructor was fantastic. The music during class was energetic but not too loud so you could hear her the entire time. The class size was comfortable; not too packed but enough bodies in the room to make it fun. The studio was clean and the instructor made sure everyone was equipped and comfortable. She encouraged people Togo at their own pace and take breaks as needed. The only downside is that the studio is right next to planter fitness and a beauty school so parking was crazy (7pm class) but there is more parking in the back parking lot.

I would give dr Erickson himself a full five star rating. he delivered all three of my kids and helped me with multiple ob/gym surgeries as well. I followed him from the various offices he's been at over the last 8 years. he is incredibly caring and really listens; he's an advocate for his patients.   The office is a whole nother story. if you call the wait is always super long, even if you have an appointment you sit in the waiting room forever and if you are having medical issues (pregnancy related or not) you have to go through the staff and doctor assistants. If you need an appointment non pregnant related you need to schedule out months in advance.   Case in point today: I scheduled an annual exam and an appointment to discuss some concerns over two months ago. I took the day off, showed up on time and they didn't. have me in the system. They told me I could wait and been seen by the PA but it would 2-3 hours wait. I said I had an appointment and the office staff "well I guess it didn't get saved. he's booked solid and there is no getting you in at all with him today. the next appointment with dr Erickson is end of April beginning of May". this is not the first instance of having rude, unsympathetic, muck up interactions with the office staff either.   I've put up with the subpar office practices for the better part of decade because of the amazing doctor but this might be the straw that broke the camels back.

Thank goodness there was a place open today, 3pm on a Sunday!  My 8 year old ran straight into a foosball table and had a bleeding gash in his mouth. The urgent care said he my have broken the tooth's socket or damaged the adult teeth yet to come in. The urgent care gave us the flier for OnCall Dentist.   The office was quiet, had football on the tv (which was nice because that was what we missing out on at the moment), was clean and the staff were all very nice. There were tvs in each treatment room which helps drown out those usual awful dentist equipment sounds.The panoramic X-ray wasn't working, or maybe because of his injury they couldn't get it to work, but other than that all the equipment seemed well maintained.    We saw Dr Nack and he did a really good job of making my son comfortable. He explained every step as they went through the exam and X-ray and answered all the questions we had. He gave us some useful information to discuss with our primary dentist for when we followed up.   Next time (and I know there will end up being one with these kids of ours) we have a dental emergency we will come here.
