At Kai, dinner is an event and an adventure. We had a divine meal. Kai is our hands down favorite at the culinary festival Devoured. Now we know why. Attention to detail and the exquisite talent of the chef and staff shine through each course. Beau had the largest piece of foie gras I had ever seen served. I felt fortunate to finally get there to enjoy the ride!

The food here is consistently good. We tend to come here annually at Christmastime while shopping at the mall. Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots.  My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner. Yet another chain with multiple locations in the valley.

We always go non chain and love this local joint. The fish tacos, Shrimp quesadillas and burros are our favorites.  Lulu's caters also. It isn 't cheap but it is really good.

I can't believe I haven't  reviewed this place. It is number 1 on my breakfast" "go to" places. I like everything about Liberty Market. From the historical  Market door used as a white board posting specials as you walk in, to the hanging Edison bulb lighting, to the  exposed brick, it just screams cool. It is not a chain and the food is delicious. Be warned the portions are huge so we usually split a meal. The scrambles are delish. Just had the Sicilian today, three eggs, onion, mozzarella, tomato and Italian sausage. Yum.  Special shout out to the creatively decorated mixed gender bathrooms and free wifi!!!

This is a very nice venue. I think there are no bad seats in the house and the acoustics are really good. I have seen a number of productions here and it is always a great night out. My only complaint is that it is brand spanking new. I am old school and love venues with a history and some fabulous old architectural interests. Think Palau de Musica in Barcelona...

This is one of the 5 top reasons to live in the valley and put up with the heat. Tubing naysayers talk about litter/pollution but hey that was 25 years ago. Been lately? We go several times a looong summer and each trip is a journey. In May, everything is so green! As the summer wanes, various blossoms come out and the river takes on a different personality. When the cottonwoods blossom, the trees drop  "snowflakes" as you float by.  Yesterday there were huge fluffy clouds that cast shadows on the mountains and looked spectacular.  The black birds with the orange shoulders are my favorite. But the cranes are eye candy too. Fish jump, the wild horses drink and it's a lovely float. The scorching heat coupled with cold water is amazing.   Tips for tubers over 50: Go midweek and midday to avoid the boom box drinking party groups.  Sunscreen: apply before, during, during and during. Wear a hat Wear water shoes!!! Bring a sheet and don't tie it onto the tube so you can sink into the tube and get the back support. Bring drinking water too! The shuttles are convenient and even civilized now. Get out of river sooner than later when you see the sign. It is difficult to get out of a tube that  you've been in for hours, in a fast current on slippery rocks.

I'm not a bagel expert but I am from New York and know bagels. I used to love this place when Hector owned it. Then, another owner had it, and now I am unsure who owns it but the bagels have gotten very sad.  Formerly chewy and remarkable, they have deteriorated to grocery store quality that doesn't satisfy. They are so swollen and breadlike, often there are no holes. I had the last dozen presliced and each one has a 1/4 inch bottom and large top that now won't fit in my wide slot toaster.  Goodbye Bagelnosh. Whimper.

I just dinged a star off after finding out there are three additional locations in Texas. The food is MEAT. Huge portions, pricey and delicious. They offered a two for one entree deal for super bowl Sunday so we checked it out.    The restaurant is really cozy and feels like a "grown up", date restaurant. We were seated in the Arizona room which has less ambience. Next time we will opt for the bar or the little tables by the kitchen. It is wood fired cooking so the place smells great walking in.    It always annoys me when the $42.00 rib eye comes ala carte. Yes, know it is organic and quite large but throwing in a small side of mashers or a steamed carrot or two would be a nice gesture. That being said, we ordered the green chili mac as other yelpers recommended and oh my... Outstanding! The Yukon horseradish mashers were a bit overpowering but it did encourage me to try to make them at home. I had a lamb shank which was melt in your mouth divinity. The au jus was perfect to soak up the homemade brioche.    The wine list was fine, nothing special but had a good range of reds and whites and prices. The service was good. We went really early, with the elderly set and loved the 2:1 deal. Yes we will go back, it was a special meal.

The "Insights" tour was on my bucket list for a long time. We both found it very engaging and interesting and informative. I am now looking at buildings in a different way. I went just to go- and walked away changed. My husband went because I dragged him and now wants to go see Frank Lloyd Wright buildings  in each city we travel to.

Got in at the tail end of happy hour and loved the original drink menu and appetizers. I will be back for that Mexican Mule. It is a perfect summer drink and I want more. We were the only patrons so it was quiet.. It'sa really nice watering hole when it's over 100 degrees. Monti's has great parking, it  is dark, it is cool and it has Mules!

We discovered House of Tricks at the gourmet food festival "Devoured". They served a zesty prawn on a bed of grits with kimchee. Sounds bizarre but it was fabulous. This inspired us to swing by Saturday night  on a hungry impulse. We could have wept when we saw the aforementioned prawn dish on the appetizer menu. It was better than we remembered. Next we had the Korean BBQ ribs. The portion was quite large and the flavors suprisingly bold and bright. We finished our meal with a house salad and duck.  I love good food. I love House of Tricks. This is a special date night, or freinds coming to town kind of place. The patio dining is romantic and I was impressed that our fellow diners were a multinational bunch. This shows the broad appeal of the delicious food. Our service was very good. This place is a winner and we will definitely return!

I abhor this place and find myself there every few years. Help, I need help. Just yesterday, the kid points me to the section of the store to purchase a blue tooth mouse. I didn't need a "casual over there", I need help selecting a mouse. The lines to check out are crazy like Christmas and I find the store completely overwhelming.  Try putting twice the sales people on the floor to help those in need. The guy at the cell phone area had a line three people deep to ask simple questions. I feel like a criminal leaving with the person checking my receipt although it doesn't bother me at Costco. Probably because I am already  irritated and  that is the final rock in my shoe and thorn in my side. RIP Radio Shack

The first time we ate here; we waited over four hours. One might think that is nuts but we had a few bottles of wine and bonded with the other waitees. The food was fabulous. Fresh, Fresh, fresh! Love the pizza with the arugula.  Everything about it is right on.  Our second time through we went late afternoon and enjoyed it all over again. I am so proud this place is in our city. It inspired us to try the other Bianco eateries, stay tuned for those reviews.

Flay Slayed it. We loved our lunch and will definitely return. I don't normally eat fries but...these are amazing. Lamb cobb salad is an unusual dish to see on the menu so I had to give it a whirl. It was exceptional. We ordered the ahi nachos. I found the chips distracting from the main star of the dish. Dining mates burger was crazy good. Even the wine menu was reasonable and not marked up 300%.   I'm glad Bobby's place is a winner!

We had a nice evening here. It feels like a "cozy date" restaurant and all was delish. Came via a Yelp search and was pleased at the results. First of all the Margaritas are really really good. They make their own sweet and sour mix and it shows. Not too sweet, not too sour... just right.      We started off with chips and salsa and guac. Should have skipped this course as most of the items were repeated with the taco platters we ordered. Thought the chips were a bit dry and not salty enough. The salsa was different and interesting but certainly not memorable.       So why four stars? Loved the seared ahi tacos.  The ahi melts in your mouth and the homemade tortillas and guacamole coupled with this fabulous margarita? WoW. Partner ordered the short rib tacos and they were really good too but the ahi won out.  We will try the swordfish next time and start the meal with that fabulous quinoa kale salad that made us sing.     The service was exceptional. We will return and plan on giving a dinner out at Chelsea's Kitchen as a Christmas gift to make sure that happens!

I really like the Compass Grill. It is a great way to see the Valley and enjoy a good meal. I am never completely wowed by the food but it is solid and a we leave satisfied and happy. We all enjoyed the appetizers; a flatbread, charcuterie board and the fondue. My pork loin was slightly dry, but the S/O short rib was to die for. Auntie loved her salmon and thought it may have been the best she ever had. We thought the service was particularly excellent.  The Compass Grill is a great place to take visitors, it is romantic and definitely on our A tour. We like to go at sunset to take advantage of all the various lighting and views while we dine.

We really like this venue. It is small so there is no bad seat in the house. We had a general admission for a concert and are so glad we didn't get seats. They were crammed together in front. The lawn is tiered to you have great views of the stage. Sit on the grass and the embankment behind you serves as back support. The bathrooms are clean and the beers somewhat reasonable. Glad we ate before we went.  Dinging a star because the acoustics are not as they should be. Who doesn't love and outdoor venue on balmy spring evenings?

We need to come here more often. I say that each time I go but somehow end up at Gilbert Pizza when the mood strikes. The thing that sets Nincantonis's apart is the fabulous super thin but crispy crust. A pizza is only as good as the gravy (sauce) and that too excels. I appreciate the sausage is the real deal and not frozen bullets like some pizza joints.  Yeah, we need to come here more often.

This sets the standard for all Gyros for me. Everywhere else has to try to at least be close to George's. All fail. I can't speak to the entire menu because I can't get past the gyro and side salad. The fries look great and they do have pasta on the menu.   The gyro's are the perfect blend of everything and delicious. I highly recommend them. It is a local joint and although they have tried to "up" the ambiance, it really doesn't matter. It is what it is. They are closed on Sundays.

Pros:  We like this bar. The proximity to Lifetime Fitness is great.  We try to go for happy hour at least once a month- a good value. Love the wings, haven't tried any of the other food.  Cons: Tap beer selection could be better. It is a chain.

This little shop is pure magic. We sauntered in post dinner and had a fabulous finish to our meal. The chocolate lava cake made me whimper and mewl. The cake itself was a little piece of perfection and  the chocolate erupting from it truly amazing. It was served with vanilla ice cream surrounded by a fine bed of chocolate crumbs. We paired this with two bold red wines that really brought us to the apex of dessert heaven.  We met Julia and are excited about her efforts to give the Ghana(ese) people a hand up. It's a great mission to be able to change lives through chocolate! We'll be watching her website due to be relaunched to see the progress of Julia Baker Confections.

I am trying to like Tina's Ethiopian. Love the concept; small business, great food..... I will give it one more try at least. Tina seems like a character!   First impression: Walk in the door and get greeted with "Do you have a Groupon"? Well, no, I don't, but now I  feel badly about it. We had a delicious lunch for cheap and were delighted. Met Tina, who told me next time, to bang on the back door if it looks like she is closed, she will feed me".   Time two, had a meal that was half the food for a third more the price. Lots of bread. The sign on the door says closed at 1:30. But we walked in anyway (rather than bang on the back door) The website says open until 3pm for lunch. This is quintessential Tina. I'm trying.......  This restaurant is closed. The location is now a Thai place....

I have only been here with a large group. Each time (3), I thought the service was excellent and the food very tasty. I love the ambiance and am so glad we have this little jewel in the Valley.  From the Monte Cristo to the homemade granola and omelets, the food is solid and I think the portions appropriate.   My only complaint about Morning Glory is the self serve drinks. The price should be posted. I am not cheap but would like to know the ice tea will be included for $2.75. After paying my bill, I made sure to stop by and get a refill.

This is a great, traditional New York Style pizza place. Be sure to pay attention to the entire menu because the eggplant  and veal parm is absolutely delicious. We braved the baked ziti pizza and it is now a family favorite. Everything is fresh and and reasonably priced.

We love this place and go often for a wide variety of Indian foods offered on their buffet. Generally I avoid buffets like the plague but this is an exception. From the chicken tikka masala to the saag paneer,  tandoori chicken, curried mutton,  and creative vegetarian options...it is Love at first bite. The naan is fresh and delicious. I like the sauces they have available and the lassi always tastes just right- not too sweet.   I am dinging a star because it is very very dark in there during the day. This concerns me, what is being hidden?  It doesn't create much of an ambiance. It is literally difficult to see your food. Secondly I think the service is subpar. People pile their used plates up and they don't seem to get bussed away. A water refill would be nice without having to ask as the food is spicy. For a place where most diners have the buffet during the day, it doens't seem there is that much that the servers need to do. Let a little light in the restaurant  and add a bus person, and the fifth star is yours!  Done deal!

Discovered this place at the culinary event Devoured. I have been craving that fabulous grilled calamari but alas, it is not on the current menu. The calamari is theoretically going on the Spring menu next week.... Arrive at 4:50 and am told that the restaurant opens at 5. At 5ish we return and discover that the happy hour pricing is only in the bar but they will make an exception for one drink each and an appetizer. So we sit on the deck and enjoy that unbelievable rum punch and a plantain thing. We spent a few weeks in Jamaica last summer and never encountered punch that wonderful,  and trust me we tried many.  Our dishes were equally great. The guava glazed pork belly on a bed of bean mash was divine. The Jerk pork and polenta was spicy and bold and interesting and so very good.  I am dinging a star for the dingy server. She is in another dimension, perhaps the Jamaican Spliff effect?   This is Jamaicain/ American, not true hard core. Where is the calaloo? We cant wait to go back. We will sit in the lounge and drink rum punches until we are sated and then proceed to the deck for exceptional dining--- and hopefully the grilled calamari.

This is our new Thai place. I am a huge fan of the panang curry. It is so rich and flavorful that it is hard to try anything else. The stuffed chicken wings are the best we have tried and the papaya salad  a refreshing surprise.  I love the environment and urban feel in downtown Chandler.

Had an hour for a beer, some grub and a chat with my guy. The server said "that's a good question" when I asked what kind of San Tan Brewery beer they had on tap. When I pointed out on the menu that it said to ask the server what San Tan was on tap, she restated "that's a good question"! I suggested perhaps she inquire to find the answer to my good question.The beer was good.  Ordered appetizers that never came. Although several servers wandered around aimlessly, trying to deliver us wings we didn't order. (3x). It was so loud that we couldn't talk. There is nothing Irish about the place but a few Guiness signs. Sit by the door and you too can smoke the cigars from the patio people, whether you want to or not.   It is new so maybe we will try again in a few months but probably not.

We came for a drink before dinner and ended up staying for dinner,  after seeing the delicious restaurant week menu. The Happy Hour is a good deal. I would like to return for that. It was fun sitting at the Kitchen bar and watching the chefs and cooks do their thing. It was also a bit loud as it got busier. We had a cheese plate that was delicious.   Dinner: They were kind to accommodate us and seat us in a quieter more secluded area of the restaurant. It is decorated very simply but trendy and upscale. I particularly liked how they dropped the cavernous ceilings by making floating ceilings. This warmed the place up and looks very cool.  Restaurant week 2013: For $40 each plus $15 for wine pairings, it was  a three course lovely meal. I liked that they didn't include dessert and you got three other courses.  1) Ravioles de Royans vs. Torchon of Foie Gras- winner the F/G 2) Frogs legs vs. Alsation Onion Tart- winner= Frogs Legs.  3) Pork Knuckle with Sherry Sauce vs. Bistrot Tenders with Carmelized onions and  Au Poivre Sauce. Winner- Tied.  The entrees were the best part of the meal. We were surprised at the portions. I always think of French dining  as being rather miniscule. We thought the wine pairing was spot on and a delightful aspect of the experience. I'm tempted to go back and try the salad with goat cheese and the Coq Au Vin...... This is a bit far afield for us to go but we may find reasons to slip in now and then.    Thanks for a memorable meal. We will definitely return next restaurant week!

This chain restaurant has a good happy hour. That is until you look around and realize every view is a parking lot. (Gilbert).  Of course the deals are so good, why not bring the whole family? I am not happy drinking sake bombers with lots of children looking at a parking lot, 'twas rather depressing.

Disclaimer: Didn't stay/ didn't gamble but..... loved this place. I love the decor and fresh flowers and open non smokey spaciousness of it. The staff was very friendly and I will definitely return here to hang out and perhaps spend a  night or two. The location is only perfect and the variety of restaurants and lounges fit every taste. I think this place is well done and I feel hip being there.

I really like the team here. A great doctor can be torn down by an inefficient office staff. Here, everyone works like a well oiled machine. In the front office, Jaunita is  pleasant and patient. She gets to deal with the constant need for my flex spending card requirements,  I can get into see a NP quickly when the need arises.   Dr. Barry is efficient and thorough and smart as a whip.  My only complaint is they need to get an online system so patients can view their lab results and communicate directly with the doctor about medication adjustments. Currently they have a medical technician call you. As a nurse, I am not comfortable with that. It feels so 1980's.

This is the only fast food place we ever go to. It happens to be on my flight pattern from work so.... a few times a year a double double with grilled onions gets to be dinner.  I have never had a bad burger or experience here. In and Out does it right! I am also happy to support a place that pays their "associates" more than minimum wage. Not because they have to, but because it is the right thing to do.

I always enjoy this festival. It's in October so it can be pretty hot. They have lots of shade areas set up.  We do the "inside" food because we think it tastes better. The lamb shank is delicious and just falls off the bone. Other favorites include the potatoes and mousaka. The stuffed grape leaves..... not so much.  They run out of Baklava on midday Sunday so be sure to purchase on arrival. The nice ladies will hold it for you so you don't have to tote it around the grounds. We inevitably try on the Greek Fisherman's hats or a T shirt, or jewelry, and always find something to buy. It's a fun afternoon listening to live tunes, eating great chow and getting in touch with my inner Greek.

This place is quirky and perfect and 5 stars deliciousness. The lamb manti was divine. The combo of cilantro and mint gave it a fresh kick. We also enjoyed the pickled shrimp with fennel dish. My only complaint but it wont affect "stardom" is that the wines were way overpriced. Be sure to make a reservation and enjoy the culinary ride.

I love this little place. It's touristy and who doesn't love a little kitsch? We enjoy sitting at the bar on the saddles and having a sarsaparilla. We don't usually eat here but have had the burgers and think they are good. It's all about the location!  I have gone on a Sunday when they had live music and are grilling outdoors. Don't know the "When's"  of this event? It is a fun stop while at the lake. You can buy a Tonto day pass at the store. The store also has a nice selection of Arizona books and wildflower guides, hiking books and all things regional.

We stopped by for an appetizer and wine and love the place. The bright colors and design elements are reminiscent of Spain. The Chiliwich placemats are a nice touch. We had the tuna cones and each bite was delicious. The avo-cilantro on the bottom of the cone was a fun surprise.  Our bartender was amiable and  solicitous. We will certainly return to explore the mulitple offerings on the menu. This is how tapas should be, little plates of adventure.

Museum:  This place is amazing. I love how the museum lives up to its theme that "music is the language of the soul".  This beautiful building is new. It is a testament to how music  plays such a vital role in all cultures throughout the ages.   The museum is divided into regions. As you approach each display with your headphones, you get to hear what the instrument sounds like while viewing a clip of it being played. The displays are expertly assembled so you see, hear and experience the music and get a glimpse of its place in the culture of that region. this is a must see for all!  Music venue: . We saw Playing For Change in the auditorium a while back. What a great band to see here!  It is  small venue (our preference) with great acoustics.   The Cafe:  The food was surprisingly good. Loved the inventive gourmet menu from all over the world. My Ethiopian soup was delicious. and that pear pastry thingy divine. It is a nice break mid museum tour.  This place does everything right and is a class act. I'm proud it is in Arizona!

Delicious pastrami sandwiches. Split one because they are huge. Had a nice large multiple ingredient salad that was rather tasteless but somehow very satisfying... Go figure.

We yelped this place looking for solid Thai food and were impressed. The mango curry was poetry. Run, go now, while mangoes are in season.  Beau had a lovely beef brisket curry concoction. We'll try the lunch specials next time and will be sure to order the salads as other yelpers suggest.  Also want to try the Thai soups this winter, our real bellweather of Thai cuisine. Who knew this place was so close to our beloved "Happy Feet"?

I really like this place. Great vibe and I am smitten with the hibiscus margaritas. We went around 7pm on a Saturday. Nice crowd but it was amping up a few hours later. Server was knowledgeable about tequilas and was friendly and fun. Loved the tacos and will return for happy hour pricing.

4.5 stars We wandered in post appetizers at FnB so that was going to be a hard act  to follow. Well, it was surprising, inventive and yummy and really really tasty. I am holding out on the 5th star because I have been flinging them about lately and want to reevaluate when I come back. I need a reason to come back.  The duck was delightful on creamy risotto, the grilled scallops were perfection on a thin smear of grits. Could have used more of the latter. The place was cavernous and rather empty on a Sunday night; a good feature in my book. We enjoyed the ambiance and felt hip being there. I'm thinking we might have to add Old Town to our dining rotation.

A wonderful oasis in the desert so to speak. Our dogs were barking after prowling the strip by night and day. This little jewel was the perfect find. Any massage place is only as good as the person giving you the massage. Fortune shined upon us and we both had relaxing, wonderful  massages. I am still purring!  Found it a little offputting that they called us a "cab" who was clearly a friend or relative driving a normal car that wanted to charge us 10$ more than the real cab that brought us there. After that massage, I couldn't even work up any angst.

I really like my library. It is spacious and cool and organized and has lovely views of the bird sanctuary. Seems like the shelves are rather barren lately. Is it all going the way of e-books?  I love libraries in general. This one is modern but lacks the excitement of the downtown Phoenix library or the amazing Seattle library; thus the 4 star review.  It never ceases to surprise me that 4 out of 5 times I go, it is closed. Go figure....

Dad spent almost a month here and we were really happy with his care. From the physical therapists, to the case manager, nurses, aides, food attendants and housekeeping; everyone was kind and went out of their way to make it a pleasant experience for Dad.  Interestingly, the nursing aids dictate their notes and wear headsets. This keeps them at the patients bedside instead of some remote location charting.  La Estancia was clean and efficient and I  recommend this place to others.

We really enjoyed this venue. What a fun concept to make a regular movie more like a night out or date.  We bought our tickets online and then went late Sunday afternoon. It was a manageable crowd and a pleasant movie going experience. We also happened to pick a winner movie which made it so much fun.  The chips for the nachos were paper thin so although tasty, they didn't hold up to the delicious ingredients on them.  Nice wine selection and the popcorn was good. We sat in desk like chairs at a counter and had lots of space and comfort.  I think the management must  improve on the cleanliness of the venue. The women's room needs an attendant because it was a mess. The bar in the lobby was sticky and to behind the bar had a number of dirty areas. This place is 25 miles away from us. We will definitely return but not for a quick flick.

Yelped this place for a great Happy Hour. Well, surprise, HH is not daily, just three days a week. We felt better about it with the free tater tot deal when checking in with Yelp. But sure enough they were included on our tab. Perhaps we didn't do it right? Or maybe the bartender was more interested in HIS cocktail? We thought the service was lacking and slow. We had an event to attend so this was problematic. We didn't have time to pursue the tater tot debacle.   So why 4 stars? The Old Fashions were really special. I am not a whiskey fan and it was remarkable. Tried a West Coast Green Flash IPA that was a winner. The aforementioned NOT free tater tots were crazy good.  We never would have ordered them but were so glad we did!  Beau and I shared the prawn/ grits/chard dish and that too was a moaner. The food and drinks here were delicious. The service, not so much. I'm not fond of imbibing bartenders that call me darling'.

We thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place. I'll start with the eye catching planters on the patio- tres' cool. Next, the ice cold brew was outstanding. I had an ahi sandwich that was cooked to perfection. It was remarkably delicious and memorable with that slaw and perfect bun. I oogled the salads of all of the ladies who do lunch and will definitely try one next time. Who doesn't love fresh, fresh ingredients and culinary prowess?

We were impressed and will return. The service was impeccable. They managed a large crowd with ease. It was nice to hang out with my beau and people watch in downtown Gilbert. We would like to try a Monday/Tuesday night special next.  Our first bottle of wine was a Spanish white. It was a great pairing with the bruschetta. The  white bean and traditional were my favorites. We tried the dips because we were ravenous and the 2.5 hour wait to get inside where they served the full menu wasn't going to work. The  artichoke and hummus dips were good, not great,  so I wouldn't order them again,  but the bruschetta...ahhh!  The second bottle of white  recommended by the manager was undrinkable. I wouldn't use it in cooking or for vinegar either. It is the first time we ever sent wine back, anywhere. The price and screw cap should have been a clue. But hey, screw caps are in vogue these days;, but I digress. I will be far more careful next time since I assumed they would not include gut rot in their selections. It's name was Domaine something... the manager did omit the swill from our bill.  Nice to have a place like this in our neck of the woods. FYI, don't park in the adjacent "the ride and share" lot and plan on keeping your car there over a Friday night. The next day is the Farmers Market, it will be held hostage until the market is over and/or have produce displayed on the hood since it'll be right smack in the way. Welcome to Gilbert Postino's. It's a  really great date night spot and a walk away from home.

The food was delicious. We tried many items. Favorites were the lamb kabobs, eggplant, lamb shank on rice and chicken khori.  What a find!

We come to this lake often because it is the closest body of water to home. It's a mellow place especially during the week. There are plenty of grills so bring dinner and enjoy a lovely sunset. The S/O fishes off the dock but I cant say he has been successful. You can look down and see the fish so that is a tad frustrating.  There is something for everyone here. The boat rentals are fun but it is a smallish lake so a half day is plenty to explore the whole thing. The saguaros jutting into the blue,blue sky is quintessential Arizona.  A few hours at the Lake releases all that urban angst and reminds you why you live here.

Liked the food very much. It was tasty, good portions and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean but somehow seemed seedy from the stale cigarette smell in the restroom to the dated bar. Definitely in our rotation of "go to" places.

Thought it was fun and really pretty and I am glad we went.  So what do we do the next hour? Would have been nice if it was larger or less crowded or something. You should be required to have kids to enter, maybe then it will it would create a sense of wonder.....?

Really like this new place. Holding back on the fifth star until I try more menu items. Tucked away in yet another of our suburban strip malls, it is a delicious surprise and much needed. We hope it is a success and will be back soon to promote that!

So we tried the new spring menu and had a "bar fight". This was a fun concept; two appetizers paired with beer- you grade the beer and the winner gets to go on tap at the end of the competition. Loved, the Blackened Shrimp Lumpia paired with Mr. Pineapple (San Tan Brewery). The second beer was an Odell IPA paired with a  Monkfish taco. We were disappointed the monkfish was fried. Next time we will try the Monkfish off the regular menu. Try the spring salad- an oral orchestra! So glad this place is in our neck of the woods!

It was ok. Enjoyed the freshly squeezed oj. My omelet was fair, nothing special. Spent 20$ (including tax and tip) for the above items and tea. I think $3.25 for a hot cup of water and limited tea selection was a bit much.  Not impressed. The decor is cheerful.

There wasn't much to like about this place except the location is  RIGHT AT the light rail. The music was annoying (live "bad" band), the drinks expensive and sour. I like a margarita served in glass, not plastic. I felt like I should have been poolside or at a sporting event. Didn't try the food and won't be back to see what that's about.

This is always a fun day. It's nice to be outdoors, follow your favorite golf pro's AND the people watching is stellar. Try to score VIP tickets if you can. "Free"  trumps the $7.00 beer anyday!   The Open is well organized, civil, and ahem, lots of bathrooms available. The parking/ shuttle system works seamlessly. We prefer Sunday when it is less crowded. Haven't attended the parties or music events but they look fun.  It is an annual event we look forward to.

We came here based on good Yelp reviews. Delicious fresh and great. I am not a big breakfast fan so for me to be psyched is unusual. The restaurant is darling with exposed brick and utilitarian pendants. They moved down a block last year to accommodate the crowds.   We sat at the breakfast bar and enjoyed a fabulous breakfast. I had a cheddar omelet with mushrooms and sourdough bread. The former was cheesy and exceptional The toast was served with marvelous fresh apricot preserves. My dining mate raved about his home fries (with fresh rosemary) and the special which was a ham scramble with fresh jalapenos. Both were winner choices.     Our server was really efficient and rather mesmerizing to see her take care of dozens of people with apparent ease. Watching her whisk around, felt like I was watching a lava lamp while waiting for breakfast, I am dinging a star because the place is really loud. Also my bottom kept sliding off the half dollar size bar stools. Noticed the ASU kids didn't seem to have that problem.     We will definitely return.  Thanks Yelpers

I was suprised this was in a nonedescript strip mall but had such panache! The food was delicious. I thought the guac was outstanding. The carne asada taco with a flour tortilla (yay) was very tasty and the Inca Salad was divinity. The salad had such a combination of textures;  quinioa, nuts, avo- with a citrussy vinegrette that was so so good.  We will definitely return. The Happy Hour pricing was a treat on the weekend!

Highly recommend this place and will be a town crier to elicit business. Finally great fare in our east valley neck of the woods! Run, go now for crazy good food. Farm to table salad was amazing and I will order this forevermore. I am eager to see what lands in this dish in autumn. The carribean jerked sea bass was a gastronomic symphony.   I may upgrade a star after our next visit. I was so excited about this place beforehand, I want to be objective!

Went to this place on a very busy pre Jimmy Buffet party there at Phx Cityscape. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks and food and watched the Parrotheads parading about. Great location. They have Happy Hour Pricing on multiple drinks and food items.   We tried the spicy yellowtail roll and were pleasantly surprised how good it was. The next item was a pan seared butterfish that was amazing. It was moist and delicious and served on a bed of roasted asparagus with a light sauce.  We were impressed with how they handled a large raucuous crowd with aplomb and kept it festive. We will definitely return. Love the late night hours too!

We really liked this place a lot. We were introduced to it via the culinary food event  Devoured.  Short Leash Dogs stood out amongst incredible contenders. So, that inspired the 22+ mile trip for a hot dog.  We started with the fried pickles. They were good and unique but I was satisfied after two or three and there was a big basket for 6$. I ordered the Oliver with a spicy beer hot dog. When I picked it up, water literally ran out of it for lets say 20 seconds. Too late, my naan was now soggy. Clearly no one even attempted to drain the sauerkraut. The taste was there  and the salad was exceptional. Partner had the Moki. That was divinity wrapped up in a naan. What a crazy good combo of deliciousness on a spicy dog. We would definitely order this puppy again....with a salad. The chips were boring. So we drove 22+ miles, spent $42 on hot dogs (with two delicious tap beers and tip) and will do it again. The restaurant is darling and funky!

Loud, noisy, busy, took over an hour to get "fair" food.  I just don't get why people like this place. I really wanted to since I am a Gilbert resident. Uh, no.

I want to love this Thai place so close to home. Spouse  brought home takeout and forgot to ask them to omit the bell peppers. After carefully removing all the bell pepper from two entrees, I had a dinner size plate full of peppers and the entrees could now fit in a small coffee cup. The flavors were very good. We will try again.

Chicken and Waffles? Well it's their third or more location so we were game to try it out. The Place:   As you approach the restaurant  your head is filled with a sickenly sweet aroma that fills the palate and reminds me of being on a pier with cotton candy and a ferris wheel. The restaurant is deafeningly loud  on a busy Saturday night. The food: The chicken was moist and crisp on the outside and just beautifully prepared. There was no seasoning at all which would have really showcased this dish. Salt is a flavor enhancer, try some. it was bland and boring. ho hum The waffle was oversweet and I wouldn't even like it for dessert. I prefer to put my sweet (syrup or fruit) on top of the waffle, not have the waffle over sweet to begin with.  We tried it; won't go back though.   Except maybe for a piece of chicken, I"lll bring my own salt and peppa

T'was a lovely way to while away the afternoon... sipping Tea and champagne and nibbling on delicate sandwiches, scones and desserts whilst gabbing with the girls and enjoying the piano music. Very nice and elegant and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised about the amount of food because I arrived hungry. The grandeur of the Phoenician adds to the experience and this is a special day out.
