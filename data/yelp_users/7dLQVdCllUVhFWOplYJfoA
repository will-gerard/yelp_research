I love El Molinos!! Their breakfast burritos are my favorite! My definitely my go to place for mexican food and THEY DELIVER! Thats right Mexican food that delivers. The food is pretty authentic, which is rare to find in these neck of the woods.   I wish I could of taken a pic of how the food is packaged for delivery. I mean everything is sealed, taped and packaged very nicely and professionally! No messes, no forgotten items, LEGIT PACKAGING! Which to me is a big deal means they really care how your food is delivered!   Again highly recommend this place for eat in or delivery! You guys rock!

I hate hate writing a bad review, but after my second bad interaction with Pep boys, I feel like its necessary.   So I went in to get my headlight lamp replaced. I told them the lights I wanted, they said ok, $62 includes parts and labor. Cool I said do it. A couple mins later the kid, comes by and said oh I am sorry I quoted you incorrectly its going to be $89, and then gave a long explanation of why and I said ok. Then some sort of manager guy comes out and he wants me to go to the service desk. I go over and he says because the make of you car, and how difficult the headlight repair is for these, its going to be $92 per headlight. We have to disassemble your entire headlight assembly and replace the bulbs. He laid out this really convincing story that it would be a really long job. Well I happen to know how to replace the headlights because I had replaced my turn signal bulbs after they messed it up in the first place. I asked why take apart the headlights? When there a cover in the wheel well, that you pop out and take the bulb in/out. He goes oh there is? And we go out to look and the guy had already popped it out and starting taking it out that way.   So imagine if I hadnt had that knowledge of what the job encompassed then I would of been like ok $92 each is cool. And way over spent of this repair. Very very sad to have encountered this experience here. As women we already are scared of getting ripped off by mechanics!  In the shop they have a sales number goals, total goals for each department.. Well word of advice, worry more about your customer experience, and you wont have to worry about your sales. Providing a great customer experience, will bring repeat customers, and referrals.   I will never ever step foot in the shop again.

I've been living in Scottsdale for almost 2 years, and finally found a hairdresser and a salon that I absolutely love. I got my haircut today with Ashton, and it was exactly what I wanted, she didn't get scissor happy, and even fixed my uneven haircut! The salon is clean, adorable, and everyone there looks happy, and just gives off a good vibe. I highly recommend Ashton, and this salon.

My old hair stylists moved, and was in a pinch and needed a hair cut. In talking with one of my clients, she recommended Arizona Hair Co. I was a walk in and they were awesome about getting me in right away. I saw Danny who asked ALOT of questions, which is awesome. To me it felt like he was trying to dial in exactly what I wanted. I was ill prepared no pics or anything just cut my hair. haha Oh boy and did he nail it! I love my hair cut, everyone else thinks my hair cut was awesome.. best part about it was that it was only $16! Left a big tip, cause dang I was happy! I highly recommend Danny and the Salon.. CHECK THEM OUT! You won't regret it.

#newyear #newme... Yes at this time of year, thats everybody's goal. I have heard lots of great things from clients of mine, so I wanted to check it out. Now being a bigger girl you are always scared of looking dumb, being left behind, or it just being way too hard. But my coworker convinced and said lets try it! So first off, I love the ease of use to book online, super easy! Love it! They even have classes that are free like stretching and running stairs. What? Thats pretty awesome, but not doing stairs... YET! ha!   So our first class with Madi, she was super awesome from greeting us, explaining what, who where, and what. The best part was when she'd give an exercise, shed give different levels, cant do a burpee, do this or that instead. So its works for every level! You adjust it to what you are comfortable with and build it up to the "real exercise" (Thats what I call the hard level) So you go through all these different workouts and stations, and every time you do its different. Which keeps things interesting, and has you wondering all day, I wonder what exercise is going to kill me today. :) Its a good kill tho!   BUT my most favorite part of this studio, is the instructors, classmates, and overall attitude. It is super like team work, encouraging, and everyone is so nice! And if a veteran sees you doing something wrong or struggling, they help you and encourage you. The encouragement from the staff and fellow classmates, is what has kept me coming back, and will continue to long after my special runs out. I cannot wait till I can do this like 2-3 a week instead of once a week.   I highly recommend this fitness studio anyone looking for a fun great way to get in shape, or get back in shape. I cannot say enough good things about them.

Where can I start... Well as a female going to an auto repair shop is something we always dread! We're always afraid to get ripped off or taken advantage of! I recently bought myself a new car and was told by a friend to have Parts Score check it out that they are awesome, reliable, and priced well. I made my appointment and told Jason and Leah my concerns. Jason did a full inspect of my vehicle, oil change, and made recommendations for repairs. He fully explained his findings and did not make me feel dumb, and in a way so I would fully understand. There was no pressure, there were options, and priced extremely well.  You can tell that they are passionate about what they do. I almost wish I had a nicer car so they can do all those fancy tricks and modifications. HA!   I am lucky to have found such an amazing shop that will take care of me and anyone I refer to them. And more importantly, as a woman I will highly recommend Parts Score to all my friends and clients for hassle free-worry free-awesome service. I can't thank them enough for that piece of mind!

So I bought a Groupon for this place cause I'm trying to find a nail place that I love. Groupons make it easy and cheap to try. Booking the initial appt was easy and fast, and very accommodating. ITs a cute little salon in Old Town, with great parking and not alot of traffic. The girls there are super friendly, like you just want to stay in there all day and just gab with them. haha I love the job they did and will definitely be back. The prices outside of the groupon are super affordable, so it looks like i found my new nail shop! Great place! I am so lucky to have tried them.

OHHHHH LAAWD! I wish I could add a sound clip to emphasize my oh lawd. I am a huge taco snob, and love trying new spots. The chips and salsa were awesome, I loved the hot fresh chips. Then they brought my drinks out and included a big carafe of cold water. Seal the deal, I am already sold on this place. No having to wait for refills. Then I ordered three tacos from the recommendations of the waiter, steak, shrimp, and pulled pork, also a side order of black beans and creamy rice. The tacos are huge! They should be called mini burros! They were also super delicious, and that rice! Can I have the recipe?? I think I have been back every week since I went, I am obsessed! Highly recommend!!
