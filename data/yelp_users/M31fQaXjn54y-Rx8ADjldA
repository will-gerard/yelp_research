Everyone seems to have different views of the VA Medical system but I for one have always received quality care and this VA is no exception.   I like they they are at the tail end of a solar project that is putting panels over every parking spot in the lot, this (I am told) will power the entire VA building and save millions in power bills, plus the added benefit to having covered parking in the middle of July.   Speaking of parking... there isn't enough, so sometimes I have to park north of the VA in the veterans home/ park parking lot, they do have a guy in a golf cart shuttling people, but show up early, I have driven around for 15 minutes waiting for someone to pull out.

while I didn't purchase anything here the service was super fantastic!   I was looking for a specific item that they did not have, the lady that helped me out spent about 10 minutes looking online to help me find someone locally that might have it.    Thank you and well done folks!

I have lived here for 4 months now and have seen enough to do a review.   I don't really have a down side here, although I think one of the big selling points for me was the covered corner balcony that is about 10 x 10 and somehow they are almost all (if not all)  arranged so that you can't see into another apartment or balcony.   EVERYONE on the staff is friendly and helpful.   The apartment floor plan is two bedroom two bath unit with the bedrooms being on opposite sides of the apartment and good sized.  The guest room has enough room for my queen sized bed dressers and a love seat, the master has a large walk in closet.   It is a quite two story complex, neither myself or my roommates have heard our neighbors ...ever.    The pool closes down at 10 and even then it isn't too loud on the second floor, it was a concern of mine but isn't a problem at all.    Parking is reasonable for an apartment complex, between my roommates and myself we have three cars and only a couple of times have we had to park down the complex a ways, but a spot opened up after a bit and we moved them closer.   The Apartment is behind Fry's grocery store, which would be great if their prices weren't so out of line.  I often say that Fry's "forcibly violates my soul."   There is the Grocery Outlet across the street, Chase Bank near by, Indian food, circle K, Hardware Store, Vietnamese Restaurant (me no rikey), a late stage alcoholics bar called the Hoot Owl, Baskin- Robins,  Padre' Murphy's, 2 Auto Parts stores, a poker club, Papa Johns and more all withing the 4 corners of the intersection and an easy walk (October -May).    Oh... I almost forgot!  A church about 500' up the road with AA meetings so you can walk there from either bar.    Which will come in handy if my heavy drinking ever turns into alcoholism.     I am glad I didn't fall for the dog and pony show of the apartments which shall not be named on the SE corner of the 101 and 17 hwy.

Update:   DO NOT MOVE HERE.... DO NOT MOVE HERE....     11/9/20211   The apartment management team sometime in the middle of the night put notices on every door telling us put our fire extinguishers outside our doors by 8 AM or we would  be charged $45 for them to enter the apartment on a later date.   What a complete jackass move!!!   SCAM ALERT....SCAM ALERT    They only seem to care about money and trying to scam those who are not going to stand up for themselves against their bullshit tricks and lies.    CHECK BEFOE YOU MOVE SOMEWHERE AND BE SURE NOT TO RENT FROM ANY PROPERTY RUN BY "GREYSTAR" PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, IF YOU VALUE INTEGRITY AND CUSOTMER SERVICE.                 The property management company and staff have all changed.   I get the distinct impression that the current management company had no respect for their customers, the residences.     An example would be the recent notices posted of their legal right to enter your apartment and that they would be entering in the next few days.  They didn't offer any reason why they would be coming into my apartment and on top of that had marked the box indicating that the legal notice had been hand delivered to a resident vs. the box that said it was left on the door and a certified letter had been mailed.  I happened to be awake and the notice was dropped off at 11pm.   Shady people....very shady.   The lack of respect for customers is similar to the experience I had with this property management company at another property.   We also suspect that the new Management company has sold our information as we have been recently getting more junk mail from strange sources.   We noticed a lot of the same junk in the garbage can so we are thinking they may have sold everyone out.       I love the apartments, the balconies and layouts but really dislike the staff.     I have nothing but disdain for the management company Greystar.   Update:   I have down graded to one stare.   WARNING, DO NOT MOVE HERE....DO NOT MOVE HERE....

lets start with your parking choices. Valet up by the front door with the disabled parking or climb up the mountain from the bottom lot. Sounds bad but I was thankful for my Mom's disabled parking tag.   I do have to give it props for atmosphere (do people give props anymore?) the view is great, the drinks were tasty (long island iced tea) and the staff mostly attractive.   I ordered the prime rib, it has some fancy name for the size like "ranch hand" it was the 16 ouncer done medium well. It was done to perfection with the exception of the fact it was cold, visualize 16 oz slices of medium well prime rib sitting in a 90% oven waiting to be ordered.   The veggies were piping hot and the baked beans were tasty. My mom later claimed that her chicken wasn't very good and my Dad liked his steak OK, but nothing to go back for. Since it was my Aunts B-Day we all just went with the flow (she thought she was paying). BBQ? There wasn't a smokey flavor to anything other than the beans, my Dad's steak didn't have any "BBQ" flavor.   There was a "good" (is there good country music?) by good I mean talented, live country band that allowed a few very good guests to sing, while people scooted their boots, young and old. This was fun to watch.   For the price, I would expect much better food. But if you go, go to have a good time, around folks also having a good time and don't expect the best food ever. P.S. don't be a wuss, and take the slide down to the dining area.

Think consignment in Scottsdale and you might be tempted to think everything is going to be expensive. Not here!   What do they have? Pretty much everything you need to furnish and decorate a house.   I was talking to one customer about how great the price was on a giant framed mirror (7' x 5' ish) and she mentioned that she was buying this original framed art because the frame was cheaper and better than what she could buy at Michael's. About a month ago I bough a frame print for $10 and I am sure the frame its self is worth more than $10.   Just a heads up this store does not have cloths, at least not that I saw.    So... all that and friendly staff that have fun and seem to like their jobs makes this one of my favorite places to bargain shop for more stuff, after all who doesn't need more stuff?

Hungry, I ventured out to find Big City Bagels. I plugged the address into my new phone and headed out. 15 minutes later and I was pissed off and wondering if I had a retard sandwich for breakfast. I could NOT find this place, and kept being told "you have arrived" when passing an empty field. I looked online for better directions and still couldn't find this place, I finally decided to give up and head somewhere else when I exclaimed "holy shit!" I found it.   The moral of the story? Their address of N Pima doesn't work well with GPS thanks to the city of Scottsdale changing the road but NOT any of the business addresses so here...    Corner of Hayden and Frank Loyd Wright next to BedMart and Staples and 4 Peaks Brewery.   Okay now I am over it....   I very much enjoyed the veggie sandwich on the onion bagel, everything was very fresh and very tasty, with drink and cookie it came to about $5.50 for lunch. Well worth it. I will go back for sure and have lunch.

I, being a notorious cheap skate, purchased a used bike on CL however my first ride was down to this place to have them look it over and do a tune up.   With in a few minutes they were able to identify a number of things that I needed to get fixed.   They did a great job and it wasn't to expensive, or at least it didn't seem unreasonable, I really don't have anything to compare it to.    While out of my price range (I only paid $1K for my car) there are some amazing bikes here.   Don't let the little sign by the road with an arrow that says "Bikes"  fool you this is a top notch shop.

What the hell is wrong with Glendale??? For the love of God raise your standards people, this place is absolute crap Teriyaki. It's the worst buffet quality food without the inconvenience of having to get up and get more.   The food is not cooked to order which is the first problem, there is no way you can serve my giant bowl or rice and dried out chicken in less than 2 minutes unless this craptastic turd of a lunch is sitting in warming trays in the back.   Lazy ass piss poor food. I, like Chuck S. hail from Seattle and this place would have been closed down inside of two months if they tried serving this festering fecal poopsicle excuse for food. Okay, it isn't THAT bad, but close.    DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD FOOD TASTES LIKE.    Driving back to the house I notice another Yelp 4 star crap food joint in Glendale is closed down. Pie Zano's bit the dust and deservedly so. But again.... somehow Glendale gave these people a 4 star ??? I am loosing trust for Yelpers in Glendale.

I like this place, I don't shoot pool as a social exercise, I shoot pool because it has some sort of Zen effect for me and frustrates me at the same time (thanks to my parents beating me regularly as a child instilling a perfectionist complex) I was shocked at how busy this place can get on a weekday evening. The pool rates are fantastic I think it was like $2 / hr during the day, shiiiii I can afford that. The 9ft ers that I have played on are in good shape with plenty of space between them. I have no complaints about this place, if it was closer to my house I would go more often.

What a great concept for making money. Buy a Quiznos type toasting machine, some 12" pizza dough rounds, slap some ingredients on top and ship them down he conveyor belt and wham'o! you have a $15 gourmet pizza. I can't even fathom the profit margin on those little puppies. The pizza tastes good but so does a lot of other pizza, it is only exceptional in the fact it is an exceptionally horrible value. $30 (including $5 tip) got us a 12" pizza (Greek @ 15.99) and Anti Pasta salad ($7.74). Even now I am trying to do the math in my head an figure out how it was so much money.    We picked up the pizza and salad to go and immediately drove to Little Caesars to gets something to fill what was going to be a giant hole in our stomachs.

This was hands down the best Indian food I have had to date. I had sort of given up on Indian food with most of the restaurants in the Seattle area going to a lunch buffet which is just luke warm gross food like every other buffet I have tried.   I didn't want to spend a lot of money and most of their food is $10 and above so I got the $7 Tandoori Chicken wrap. Sweet mother of Ganesha this was amazing! Tandoori Chicken, vegetables and spices in a very hot very fresh Naan wrap.   The service was polite and prompt. The place seems to be mostly frequented by the local Indian populations (we were the only non-Indian people in there).   Being a family restaurant, expect to have kids all around you, being kids.     On a side note and I am not sure if this adds or subtracts from the over all authenticity of the experience but the smell coming out of my ass today is like a Mumbai slum! (so I hear) Woooooo Weeeeee........

Great place with great people.   I shop here mostly for my work shirts, I have gotten some amazing dress shirts from $4 - $15 since I have been in AZ.   I think my favorite thing about this place is they way they do their discounting. The longer the item has been in the store the more you save up to 75% off. Be sure to check the wall in the front of the store for the discount available based on the date on the price tag. Right now I am waiting a few more weeks in hopes that this one item I have my eye on hits the 60 day mark.   This consignment store has a decent art section, plenty of household decorations and lots of cloths and none of it junk. I find the full non discounted price to be pretty reasonable most times (the item I want right now is overpriced).   They go out of their way to be helpful and friendly and I appreciate that.

I went here off of my Groupon purchase. I know there are a few top notch Pizza places in the Phoenix area so I had high hopes for this one and they didn't disappoint.   I was a little confused going in on how things worked. The short version? Order your pizza at the register by the oven, fill your own drinks with the exception of coffee which will be brought out to you. Find a seat with your number and wait for deliciousness to be brought to your table.   We all enjoyed our pizza's and the Gelato was amazing. Pumpkin pie was sooooo good.   I do have to say we were a little apprehensive going in, it isn't what you would think of when you think of good pizza, it looks like a brightly lit ice cream parlor more than a sit down pizza place, but really it is both.   Next time I am in that part of town, I will for sure stop for a Gelato, there are so many choices and so little time.

This review is close to a one star but I like to reserve my "one" ratings for BOTH bad business and bad service. I have been in this Albertsons about 4 times now and other than Redbox don't see any reason to go back.   The last time I went there I looked at the ads taped to the window as I walked in thinking that if there was something amazing I might think about buying something but mostly I was just returning a movie. I saw celery for $.99 and figured that I couldn't go wrong with that. After 1 day in my fridge the celery hit that trash because it had assumed a wet noodle like quality to it and really wasn't edible, other than putting a bit in my chicken salad because I was desperate.   I don't like to consider myself a snob but if I go into a store like this I expect Grocery Outlet sort of prices not top dollar with some lame few cents off sales.    Now I know to not bother to even look at the ads, just hit the ol Redbox and go to Safeway or Walmart.

I am a fan of only a few coffee peddlers in the valley and somehow none of them rhyme with Char Ducks.    One of the things I am a big fan of in my iced coffee drinks is the crushed ice, so much colder and therefore tastier.    I don't hang out here, but I would.   The painting of Frank Sinatra mesmerizes me, if only it was for sale.

Run don't walk AWAY from these apartments. The dog and pony show they put on to get your business is indeed impressive. Hummer golf carts, staff all dressed up in shirt and tie or skirts, maintenance folks all clean and in polo shirts. Big screen TVs everywhere, by the pool, in sitting area's, work out room....everywhere. Staff is nice and friendly blah blah blah. I was sold on this place before I even looked at an apartment.   Lets back up a bit. I do NOT live here, this is a review of the my experience including the run around from the property management company.    Besides losing my application and not telling me about it until the next week when I went in to get a bigger apartment than I had already looked at.   Countless promises of returned calls, messages left without a return phone call. Basically I felt that once they felt that they had me locked in that they didn't have to provide any service any more. I have had a similar experience with the management company that has promised me a refund for the last month with out delivering on their promise. Also left message that I was told were never received.   I know from experience when someone makes it hard to get a hold of them there is going to be problems. There are no contact information for the management company's corporate offices, and the local "west coast headquarters" office lists numbers only, no emails or other ways to contact. You can call and get an admin person who will send you to voice mail, but will never directly talk to the person you are trying to reach.   I only got a response when I threatened to send letters to the home office to the 5 corporate offices listed on the website.   So here we sit business day 9 since the promise of "we are processing it today" and no refund.   On a weird note, I had a customer in my store who just rented from them and had much of the same experiences I did, but she needed a 4 BR place and felt like this was her only option. She too worked with Mary, who lost her paperwork too....what the hell is going on here???

Hello my name is Larry and I am an eggs Benedict snob....hi Larry... No disrespect to the 12 step crowd.   One of the worst Benedicts I have ever had.   I ordered the California something arouther Benedict with avocado, bacon and tomato. EVERY single component of this meal was the same or very close to the same texture. Soggy English muffin, soft avocado, soft bacon, grilled(???) and therefore mushy tomato with an over poached egg. Hollandaise was nothing to yelp home about. They do have a list of "mantras" or something on their menu and #4 encourages ordering the food specifically to your taste so if I do go back in (not going to happen) I would ask the English muffin to be toasted and crispy, the bacon to be crispy and the tomato to NOT be grilled. This would offset the avocado, egg and hollandaise sauce and likely make a fantastic breakfast, well aside from the giant loogie under the poached egg I would undoubtedly get for being so picky.   Seriously! Does every breakfast place in AZ peak out at average? I have yet to be impressed, even by the ones with relatively good reviews. If I win the lottery I am starting a quality breakfast joint in the valley.   My server Paula was nice, the seats were classic beat down unconfortable seats.

Having moved recently from Seattle the full service wash thing is new to me. I used to pay the same price to run my car though a building with brushes and a big blower thing at the end.   Imagine my excitement when I found out I could get my mini van washed, vacuumed, and windows cleaned for only $12.99.   I think what I like about this place is watching how hard and well the folks work on my van after it has gone through the machine. They seem to enjoy their jobs, like each other and they do a fantastic job.   I also like that I feel like I get the same service and attention to detail in my $1000 hooptie (which from what I can tell is the ugliest vehicle in Scottsdale) as the 100K + cars next to me.   It is soooo worth it to go here, I could pay a few bucks less at Costco but then I have to vacuum myself and wash the windows and dash myself...where is the value in that?

UPDATE:  Within 2 hours of posting the review below,  Dickey's contacted me in order to make things right.   Well Done!    I declined their offer for a gift card, but will try their Shea location at some point.     ______________________________________________________ In a world of liars Dickey's would be king.   Having put an ad in the AZ Republic listing a January long special of $1 BBQ pork sandwiches on Mondays I had been driving up to this location after work on Mondays to take advantage of this deal.   The Monday before last they were "out" of the pork but were good enough to substitute for another meat. This Monday they decided to NOT honor their advertised special stating "that isn't for Arizona." Your pants sir are on fire.   A. You advertised it in an Arizona specific Newspaper   B. The Shea location honored the advertised special

I wanted to get a good cross section of Oscar's offerings so I chose the Ultimate Combo.   I have to say the batter on all of the fish, crustacean and bivalve items was one of the best I have had in recent memory.    I like their Monday and Tuesday specials and the fact that they close later so I can hit them on the way home from work.    I am already looking forward to trying their $3.50 jumbo fish taco on Tuesday.    Being my first time I was a little confused when I couldn't find tartar sauce at the help yourself condiment counter, then relieved when it was delivered with the food.   I have to say, I have never used less tartar sauce before, I enjoyed the batter and the fish without covering up the flavor with the tartar sauce however, the cocktail sauce was great with the jumbo shrimp.     I will definitely be back.

This is the best coffee in the valley, oh so smoooooth.    Friendly people working here who I suspect are required to ask about your day but they do a good job acting interested =).      I stop by here every time I hit the St Vincent DePaul in the same parking lot.      Support the local guy, down with "big bean"

Lets get the positives out of the way first. Okay now that we have covered that, lets move on to what is wrong with this place.   Oh Yelpers you did me wrong on this one. Of course they might have been having an off day but I will never know.   I want to be very clear that in no way did the black hair in my tzatziki sauce effect my rating of this restaurant, as a matter of fact it was the attitude of the employees about the hair that didn't do them any favors. I realize that humans (most) have hair and from time to time one wanders into food, and that is a part of life. Not worth getting hot and bothered about in my mind. But when I show it to you and you show it to the cook, then proceed to dish up another dish of it (all the while talking in your native tongue so I have no idea what you are saying) and simply hand it to me with a "there you go." ??? Really? No "sorry about that" even? No good kids.   Okay there were some good things, the prepubescent version of the tzatziki sauce was one of the best I have ever had, and the rice was cooked to perfection. However comma what I was served was not what I had envisioned from past experience, what I was served was chicken soy sauce stir-fry with onions, A Greek salad that was reasonably fresh but soaked in vinegar dressing.   And the final nail in the coffin were the mini wedges of dried out stale pita bread. What I am I supposed to do with this? How about a freshly warmed whole pita or flat bread so I can put the ingredients inside like a wrap? It was like trying to pile meat, rice, sauce and lettuce onto a really thick corn  chip.   I recommend taking a pass on this place, or if you feel if you do, don't get the "shawarma" plate.   BTW, this is how Shawarma meat should be cooked. http://www.sanobar.com.sg/images/shawarma-org.jpg   Notice no goopy reduced soy sauce mess? Blechk!

Everyone knows you don't want to eat food at a place where nobody from that culture eats, so it is a good sign when you see a lot of Mexican folks eating at a place during lunch. On an odd side not I was just debating between saying "Mexican" or "Hispanic" I went with Mexican since I am reviewing a Mexican restaurant not a Hispanic one, (in case someone P.C douche wanted to crawl up my arse)   I have only eaten one thing here and I have eaten it repeatedly. The Breakfast burrito hits all the right marks, huge, cheap and delicious. For $4.25 after tax you get what I am thinking is about a pound of breakfast food, freshly made (sometimes you have to wait a bit) wrapped in a tortilla. I get this in the morning a few times a week and don't feel like eating again until about 4 pm. If you are looking for a good cheap breakfast I would try this place out for sure. I haven't tried anything else yet but I did get an up close look at my coworkers lunch and it too was huge and looked amazing. I sent a customer to them the other day who was looking for a place to eat and when he came back he raved about his burrito. .

I was thinking about how I have been here in AZ for over a year now and looking back to some of my favorite places and events.   I had been to this park a number of times (I didn't have a job when I got here) but the highlight was the St. Patrick's day visit.  The fountain goes off (I think at noon) and it is green.   Now for those of you from Seattle or Oregon I am sure it is food grade, biodegradable, organic, wild, free range fish food and not a harmful chemical.  Either way it is kind of fascinating as are the people walking around.   I think FH really misses and opportunity here to have a food vendor or 2 to make this into more of an event, or maybe combine it with some Irish heritage festival.   The patio's of the local business are packed, so get there early if you want to sit down and eat lunch.

uh.... no. If I want to blaze up with the hookah this might be the joint (pardon the expression). If I want to shoot pool? No way in hell I will be back to this place. I use to work at a failing pool hall in Seattle and I see much of the same here... 1. No booze. Cool, but that always means over priced table time. 2. No A/C uh.... really, you think i will be back and invite my friends to sweat it out at 108 degs in your boring over priced  smokey pool hall?....your are smokin the hope-iam my friends. Times are tough, i get it, but the winners are not who offers less, but who offers more.... you, I am sad to say lose in an epic way.

My Aunt and Uncle were in town and I was tasked by my Mom to find a great place to eat. My Uncle always picks up the check so the price had to be modest but the service and food had to be excellent and at the last minute Mom threw in "oh, and we want to eat outside." I looked for quite a while at reviews of places, I narrowed my search to the $$ places and Tommy V's stood out as one of the top ones in Scottsdale, I searched for outdoor seating and again of that list Tommy V's stood out. I didn't see any pictures of outdoor seating on Yelp (hint hint Mr. cool owner guy who I know is reading this) so I called to make sure they did have the outdoor seating and made a reservations for the 6 of us.   My first impression was a great one, I would describe the decor as clean and classy. No clutter, just a perfectly lit, perfectly decorated modern spot with the music to go with it.   I don't remember what everyone got but two of us got that Lobster Bisque which was super fantastic, and two of us got the "Manila Clams Linguine" which is by far the best seafood pasta dish that I have ever had, loaded with clams. A few of us got the "Grilled Shrimp Risotto," and they made my mom something that wasn't on the menu at her request  The service was excellent and our server did a great job suggesting the right wine for each person on the group. Well other than me because I am more of whiskey kind of guy.   We all had a fantastic time, everything we ordered was excellent and the added touch of the owner coming out to see how everything was makes this place an easy 5 stars and a place I would without reservation recommend to anyone.   Oh,.. the other thing I noticed when I was doing my research was the consistency of positive customer experiences. A lot of top reviewed places in Scottsdale seem to be hot or cold depending on your server or the night you go. Tommy V's seems to have a formula for getting it right all the time.

Who knows how long my turd of a van is going to last so I found myself in the used tire market.  After looking online and calling these guys I decided to give them a shot.  Friendliness, knowledge and service were great at first.  I had to wait for a few people ahead of me but soon I was driving out with two front used tires in what looked to be in decent shape.  Unfortunately the tires had a pretty significant wobble to them so I called back and scheduled a time to come back and have them rebalanced, which long story short did not solve my problems, they asked me to call back every few days to see if tires my size had come in for them to swap out with my bad tires.   I am a very patient guy (and I realist, after all I purchased used tires, things can go wrong)  so I politely called back for the next few weeks to only be told that they had not received any tires that would fit my van.   I am not familiar with this industry but found it difficult that between all 3 location there wasn't two tires that would both fit my ride and NOT shake like a Polaroid picture.   Finally out of the need to make a road trip and my lack of desire to have a blow out at 80 mph in the middle of nowhere I asked them to get me some new tires in to replace the old/new tires they had sold me.   They did credit me for the tires I had previously purchased but didn't give me any deals to help soften the sting of all the time I had wasted driving back and forth to their business and waiting for them to NOT fix the problem.    I ended up spending $195 on two tires (which is cheap, but they are off, off brand tires and if my van makes it 30K miles it will be a Christmas Miracle) vs. the $75 I had originally spend and I was comfortable with.     Like I say... nice, polite, knowledgeable, and hard working but if something goes wrong don't plan on any hoops being jumped through to make it right.

Instead of a traditional review here is the email I sent them:   In a world of people who like to bitch to get free stuff, I would like to offer an alternative.  I, for the first time, went to this theater this evening to see Drive (meh).  I have not previously gone to this theater because I visualized sticky floor's shitty seats and knife fights in the lobby.  Imagine my surprise when I was able to leave at the end of Drive (meh) with both my shoes and no cuts.   I will tell you what I really enjoyed about the whole experience... the GM guy (Mark?) got up and did a few announcements before the movie, my neighbor a few seats over after it was over said "i thought there was something wrong" I agree.   But GM Mark (if that is his name) acted like a skilled public speaker/ comedian with is ability to think on his feet with is fun run down of what is coming up and how to find out (Facebook).   I truly loved this personal touch as well the the chance to leave alive.    If one was so compelled to run some advertisements for this fantastic theater (I mean seriously the mirrored caves and retro doors are PIMP) I would run it as "no sticky floors."   I will also ad with all due respect to the other theaters it was nice to have a ticket taker with a personality who's entire being didn't scream "when I am done with this shift I am so offing myself."        Well done... now for Pete's sake run some independent films so I don't have to drive to Scottsdale.              That is all,         Larry B
