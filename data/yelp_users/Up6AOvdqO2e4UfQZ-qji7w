Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax.   They have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do.   The only downside, is the food. I have only tried one thing and that is the mozzarela sticks so do not try them.

Great people. They really understand pets and work with you and your pet. They won't try to upwell you at all. I would recommend this vet to anyone. Too bad I do not live in AZ anymore.

Awesome Meatball sandwich! I really like the pizza too! I have had the mozz sticks as well and their were decent, really big actually. They deliver which is also very convenient and the price is not too bad also. A good all around go to pizza joint. Next time I will have to try the other things on the menu.

Simply amazing. Old school feel, almost feels like I am back in philly. Staff is so friendly and it is a family run place. I have had the pastrami which is delicious and also had a turkey sandwich. Bread is what makes this sandwich. I want to try more of what they have. Will go back. You should go try, if have not already

Best Chinese Restaurant in the valley. If you look meat and rice, this is your place. The Schezwan Pork is amazing as well is the sesame chicken. I used to live far away from this place but still drove there to eat their food. Now I live close and I do not hesitate to stop by. It may not look too pleasing from the outside but what does nowadays. Price Cheap to Moderate

Wife and I went here one night to try it out. It is down the road from our house. We went in and we were the youngest people in there by about 30 years. This place caters to an older crowd. We sat at the bar and the service was good. The bartenders were very attentive and helpful. The food was meh. I probably will not go back, just not my thing.

Awesome little coffee/tea joint. They have free wifi with tables and couches and is fun to chill out in. Parking is the only downside side for this place so you will have to park on the street which really is not all that bad. I have not tried the baked goods yet and will have too soon. Other reviews say the baked goods are really good.

Cant get any better. Love this place. Great quick service. I am not a big fan of talking while getting my hair cut. I don't know why. I just want to get out as soon as possible. There are about 5 barbers working on a thursday morning. Plus there were tons of customers. Busy place. Will be back

I like this barber shop. I got a good cut and they were friendly. I waited for awhile  they had a huge TV so it was not that bad.  I would go back and price was pretty reasonable.

This is my favorite resturaunt. I have been here for awhile but I have always enjoyed it. I first started going to this place when it first opened before it became super popular and I would go about 4 to 5 times a week. Amazing breakfast and lunch. Hangover sandwich is amazing when you wake up from a night of fun. The Gladiator burger is still one my favorite burgers, pretzel bun applewood smoked bacon just delicious. I also enjoy the Turkey wrap, my go to meal.  Parking can be a pain but worth it. The service has always been up and down. The turnover rate for servers was high in the beginning.

At first, I read all the reviews and I was like why not? I was looking for a good barber where I lived since I recently have moved.   I had to wait an hour in order to get my haircut when I was the only person in line. The place did not have a barber shop feel and the guy was ridiculous. I took 45 min to cut my hair and I all I get is a fade. I am in the military so my haircut is really really easy. I took forever. I was like when is this going to end but if it looked good, Id accept it and find another place but it was not good at all. The guy was really bad. The place was hot too.

I got the sloppy joe on a bun and it had the perfect kick. One the best sloppy joes Ive ever had. Next time im going to try the burger. Nice little joint nestled near the paradise valley hospital. Great staff and very friendly

Called on Christmas Eve and they said they didn't not have a line. Did not have to wait really long. Great service! The PA was amazing and friendly as well as the assistant. Called my prescription and was able to pick it up on way home. Will go back again if I need to, hopefully not.

Food was not that great. It was supposed to be an aioli dressing on sandwich but it was very mustard like. Would get it without the aioli then it would be great will go back
