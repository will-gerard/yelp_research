Without hesitation, I would highly recommend Arizona Fire & Water Restoration.  I have had dealings with them for about 18 months now and have always found them responsive, competitive,  and of the highest integrity.

For the second time, I have called in a carry out order for a salad and been told it will not be ready for 45-50 minutes.  What's the point?  Sounds like Oregano's is trying to run off all their carry out customers.  It's working!  Bye bye.

Robert and the gang at Effusion Creative Solutions are simply the best!  As a commercial printer, I deal with all kinds of people in the graphics world and have found Robert to be one of the most creative and competent of all.  Effusion designed our web site and has updated it a time or two since.  As a result of their design, we continue to rank highly in Google, leading to new printing opportunities on a monthly basis.  I have literally had new customers tell me they chose us as their printer because they liked our web site.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Robert and Effusion Creative Solutions!

THIS PLACE IS SIMPLY DISHONEST!  I would NEVER allow my child or anyone else I cared about to rent here.  My college age daughter was moving out on her own for the first time.  Being a trusting sole, she agreed to a 12 month lease only to find 12 months later, that they had switched her lease term to 14 months.  I suppose it's only a coincidence that these additional 2 months got the complex through their slow summer season.  When I tried on several occasions to schedule an appointment with the manager to discuss this, they would not even return my call.  Then when it came time to move out, we tried to schedule a walk through with the manager to be sure we were on the same page in terms of the apartments condition.  We were told that they don't do this.  They have to many apartments to do this with every resident.  The managers will get together at their convenience and let us know the condition with our final statement.  Well surprise, surprise,  she didn't get any deposit back and in fact they demanded an additional $300 or they would turn her over to collections.

Clean Machine Car Wash is without a doubt, the best, cleanest  and most complete exterior car wash I have ever experienced.  Upon pulling up they have friendly professional people greet you and explain their services.  Then as you pull around to the wash bay, more friendly professionals greet you and give you a damp cloth for your interior and the air freshener of your choice.  The wash bay is very long and has every imaginable soap and wax.  But, prior to entering the wash bay they have two people actually scrubbing down your windshield and other tough spots and applying bug spray, without even having to ask for it.  As you exit the wash bay, there are more drying units than the closest 2-3 competitor car washes have combined. Then to the covered drying area.  They actually have hand held air blowers to blow the remaining water out of the cracks and crevices.  Talk about value, you REALLY get your moneys worth.  I have purchased Fast Passes for all of our vehicles and would highly recommend you do the same.
