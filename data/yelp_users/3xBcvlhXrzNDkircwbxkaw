My hamster was sick and hadn't moved for 3 days so I schedule an euthanasia.  On the phone, I asked the receptionist how much it would be and she told me $35.  I asked there if there were any other fees, such as disposal of the hamster or anything else, and she told me no, it would only be $32.  So I went and in the exam room, the lady told me it would be $70+.  I was surprised, as I told the lady that I was quoted $32.  She told me that it didn't include the consultation fee.    "What consultation?  I never got a consultation.  You just took my hamster and euthanized it."  I told her.  She kept saying that I had to pay the consultation fee, until finally, in an annoyed tone, she told me she will go ask to waive the consultation fee.    In the end, I ended up only paying $32 for them to euthanize my hamster, which in my opinion, is a little high.  They told me they gave the hamster gas, and stabbed it in the heart.  All that for $35?    Well just last week, I called and asked about giving my 9 week old puppy shots, and the lady on the phone told me it would be around $80, but every Tuesday they give free vaccinations from 2:00 - 2:30.  Wary about this "free" shot, I asked her, "do you guys charge a consultation fee for this?"  She assured me no, that it was completely free.  Well, what do you know.  I was about to bring my puppy in so  I called to schedule an appointment today (Tuesday).    This time, a different lady answered, and sounded very impatient and surly.  She told me that there were no such thing as a free vaccination.  They charged around $30 for the vaccination.  I asked her that someone told me they did free vaccinations every Tuesday, which she informed me that this "free vaccination" is not free.  They just waive the consultation fee.    Extremely annoyed, I thanked her for her time and hung up..    I called another Banfield in Gilbert asking about their vaccinations, and the lady who answered the phone there was very cheerful and polite.  Maybe it's just this location with horrendous customer service, clueless assistants, and rude receptionists.  However I will never come here again, and will advise my family and friends the same as well.

My one year old German Shepherd had a limp in his back leg for close to three weeks.  When he stopped eating and just laid in his bed all day, I brought him in.   First visit Met with Carol Lind.  She seemed very friendly, and was very thorough with her exam.  Took X-Rays which she said looked fine, ruling out hip dysplasia (which later turned out to be false because I took him to another two different vets which diagnosed him with minor hip dysplasia.  However, I understand symptoms can arise later on in life, so that might not have been her fault).   She said it was likely that he pulled a muscle, or tweaked something.  But just to be on the safe side, she said it was possible that he had Aspergillus.    In order to test for it, we had to pay $90 for the test, and $70 for overnight shipping.  Given no other choice, and since when I asked her if there were any other possibilities and she said no, I went ahead with the test.$78 for the first X-Ray, $61 for the second X-Ray, $46.50 for the consultation, and $11.50 for the meds, grand total came out to be $357  Most places waive the initial consultation fee, and most places charge X-Rays for as little as $40.  The insane prices should have been a red flag, but I was oblivious.  Well, the test came back negative, and my dog was getting worse so she told me to bring him back in.    Second visit This time, I was told that it had to be valley fever.  Total cost for the titer and shipping came out to be $181.  Once again, I had no choice but to agree since my dog already lost 8 pounds, and I was desperate to get him better.    And again, test came back negative.  I guess they finally felt bad, because they called me and offered a free consultation.  I was busy, so my mom brought him.  I told her that if she was offered another blood test on my dog, tell the person to shove it up their butt.   Third visit Another X-Ray was taken (no charge), and this time Dr. Hudman looked at it and immediately diagnosed it as Panosteitis.  He prescribed some Rimadyl, and my dog got better within a week.    Keep in mind, XRays were taken SEVERAL times, and no one else was able to diagnose it.  Given that Panosteitis is extremely common in larger breed dogs, I am not sure if the other vets were incompetent or just trying to rack up charges on miscellaneous tests.    So, in case you missed it, I was and still am EXTREMELY unsatisfied with the vets that work here, with the possible exception of Dr. Hudman (since on my invoice, it showed that he signed off on shipping of the Aspergillus test.  But then again, he might not have looked at the X-Rays).   I would avoid coming here at all costs.  But if you do, request Dr. Hudman, as the other vets are useless.

This place SUCKS!  First off, we were waiting for FIVE minutes to be seated at 1 AM.  There were 3 other parties there.  The two waitresses/hostesses saw us standing there but they blatantly ignored us.    When finally seated us, it took forever to order.  I don't understand why they were so slow.  Maybe they didn't like fellow Asians?  The food was mediocre.  Not bad, not good.  But as you can guess, it took FOREVER to come out.    The outrageous thing was they had the balls to include 18% gratuity for 2 people.    Do not ever come here.  Ridiculous service.

This is definitely one of the new hotspots to go in Chandler. They just opened a little over a month ago and serve a fusion of Mexican and American food.  The food is good and the prices are very reasonable especially during happy hour and reverse happy hour. The staff is super friendly and very attentive.    On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturday they have DJs spinning on the patio. They mix everything including rock, classic rock, hip hop, house, and usually pretty good about taking requests.  Definitely check it out!

The food here was pretty good.  I had the wings and the Pho.  In my opinion, the prices were average.  They had pretty good happy hour prices for beer, and they had a decent selection on draft.  The waitresses and bartenders were very friendly, and the service was pretty quick.  It is more of a bar vibe than a Vietnamese restaurant, which I think is pretty cool.  They have a large outdoor patio seating area as well.
