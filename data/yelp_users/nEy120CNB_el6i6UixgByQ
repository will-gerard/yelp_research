Owing to the fact that I am deathly allergic to dairy I have long pursued a treat that I could eat without fear or caution. Then I stumbled across Bahama Bucks. My husband's family had been going there for years. I crave their birthday cake, I get it with the dairy free cream they serve. I get it every time we go. In fact it is where I was proposed to by my husband. The young staff they have have always been friendly to us, and it seems that every week a new coupon comes out in the snail mail, so we oft go there. Great for families, and they have shaved ice available for snowball fights, which is fun.

It has some good food. During my pregnancy I ate here too frequently and I lost the desire to come here again. The food is pricier, though it is supposed to be healthier for you. I would visit In N Out burger in lieu of here. Also my sister had applied to work here but they would not give her the time of day to listen or even accept her application, which shows the staff of this location are not considerate to others.

I really like their food! My least favorite was the waffles and ribs! They are really careful when you tell them you have allergies. I'm allergic to dairy so when they made mine they changed gloves. It's also a nice atmosphere. You can eat inside or outside and you get $10 for your birthday!

I love it here!!! They offer coupons through emails! We've been able to get each game for $2.99 each! Though you should go on Tuesdays for $2 games. Some new friends we met offered us some of their fries and they were good and salty. It was different going at night cause they dimmed the lights but it was fun all the same.

The employees here are really nice. I tried looking for a hard to find flax seed supplement, and they helped me scan the whole store till we found what I wanted. I have always enjoyed their gelato here. It's not the cheapest but hey, it's your health!

I went here to try it, thinking it was like Outback or Texas Roadhouse. The food seemed alright, my steak was well done, yet it was the horrible nausea and upset stomach that I got from eating here that put me off from going again. I'm sure that if I went back I might like it but I'm not willing to risk it.

I got my wedding ring from here! It is very simple, yet beautiful and unique at the same time. I've received multiple compliments on it!    We personally know one of the owners and he is kind every time we go. He even remembers our names! He cleans our rings free of charge every time we are in Scottsdale. I recommend this jewelry store to everyone!

My husband is a huge movie buff and loves going to movies. I wasn't much of a movie person myself. and having moved here a few years back I had never been to many theatres. Then we went to Harkins and it was never the same. They offer good prices for us students and having the shirt and loyalty cup makes snacks very affordable. I feel the theatre is clean and family friendly. We love coming here and can't wait for 2016's movies to come out.

We love coming here, my husband is a big believer in local businesses and loves smaller grocery stores, especially since he worked in one for a year. We love being able to see the same people when we go to the pharmacy and have them know us. Their doughnuts are some of the best we have had compared to other grocery stores in the valley. Can't beat their local garden greens either. They even have self checkout, which is convenient.

I never cared for chicken wings until my husband took me here when we were dating. We ove coming for the Tuesday special on wings. That's all we go there for nowadays. So many flavors to try from. What makes them the best is that although they may seem smaller than that of Buffalo Wild Wings they have less fat and inedible parts on them and are just good meat and flavor, usually not to dry or to sloping wet. It is so nice to see the manager come by our table each visit and greet us and check to see if we are doing alright. Keep it up

For a modern day restaurant you would think that they would be more aware of people's dietary needs, such as being allergic to dairy. I understand this isn't usual but they had seemed unapologetic about helping me. The rice plate I ended getting wasn't the best. The price was okay per person.

I like Subway. The food is usually fresh and the staff are polite for the most part. My favorite is the toasted flatbread with chicken breast! The service is a little slower here but it's still good food.

What a fun place to visit. It is a buffet of pizza where you can get as much as you want. The variety of pizzas is terrific. I love the oreo dessert pizza. A great place for the family to visit. Fair prices too. I'm allergic to dairy so they made me my own pizza there. excellent staff.

I participated in a friends event they planned. She had helped them and lent them table cloths and other things to help plan the event. She asked for them back and has never gotten a reply from the owner. Terrible customer service, you would expect them to be willing to do anything to help the customer, but they won't listen. Be weary and do you homework first when choosing your planner.
