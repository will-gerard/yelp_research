I let my experience here simmer for a long time. I kept putting off writing a review because I did not want to offend anyone...but after getting a few good haircuts again I decided to vent and write a review...after all doesn't a good yelper write about the good...and the not so good?  I went to this place based on the great yelp reviews. I made an appointment for a haircut and color.  Lets start with the color...she left it on for (I felt like) a very long time. After the color was washed out I touched my hair and already felt a ton of breakage. I mean pieces of hair were just coming off in my fingers. I don't know what happened...if it was left on for too long or the color was too strong...but my hair had never been that damaged before. Also...the color was just not what I asked for...the highlights were very chunky and unnatural and the brown faded super fast.   As far as the cut went...I had a super cute haircut that I got in LA that just needed to be trimmed up again. Instead it was just made to look like a "soccer mom" cut. Chucks of hair were cut that just did not need to be. When I went back to my hair guy in LA he remarked..."wow....you were really hacked into weren't you".  The salon was nice...but I was just not happy with my haircut or color.

I thought the chocolates were ok. They were all nicely laid out...very pretty...they were ok.  The real story here is the Frozen Yogurt. I lived in Los Angeles for 3 mths and while I was there I got addicted to Pinkberry. You know...that craze going on over there with the "tart" fro-yo. Its is all the magazines people!  It was bad. I mean I was going to Pinkberry like 5 times a week.   So I come to Arizona and there are no "tart" frozen yogurt places to be found. I was going through serious withdrawal. Hands shaking...headaches...that kind of thing (well not really...I may be exaggerating...but I wanted to draw a picture for you)  ANYWAYS....I was reading through the "Phoenix New Times Best of 2007 edition" and they happened to mention the "Best Yogurt in Arizona". I was shocked to read this little candy shop was selling Red Mango Yogurt (basically the originator of the whole tart yogurt thang).  I could not wait to make the trip over there. Lets just say I read the review around 9pm last night and guess who showed up to get fro-yo today..yup you guessed it little ol' me.  You must try this yogurt  if you are a "tart" yogurt virgin. It is fat free and only comes in two flavors (green tea & original)..then you can load it full of various toppings (my favorites are the fresh fruit,...yum).  Just be warned...its kinda pricey. A small is 4.50.

Just went into Brueggers this morning and they told me today was their last day! They are closing :( Oh well...guess no carb loading for me.  *****  Ok....let me preface this by saying I use to work at a Brueggers Bagels in college (in Michigan).   Usually when a person works at a food place of business they do not like to frequent it once they quit/leave.  However....I still love my bruggers. First of all...they make all of their bagels in the store (unlike the other bagel chain that starts with and E and ends with a stein). Their bagels are yummy and crispy and I am in love with their everything bagel.   Yeah...the soups come out of a bag...but I gotta admit they are super tasty!   I am so excited there is a brueggers on my way into work while I am in AZ...and I hope I do not overdue my carb intake while I am here.

Ummm...well....they have parrots in the lobby....I guess thats a good thing.  I would never stay here. A few of my friends are staying here and I went to visit them. Everything about the hotel needs a complete update. The rooms are old and smelly. The paint in the shower was peeling. The tv did not really work good. I think I could feel the springs in the mattress.  It is right across the street from Gammage auditorium .... so if you are visiting ASU I guess it has a pretty good location. But thats about it.  Oh yeah, there is an IHOP attached to the hotel,....so if you get fed up of your crappy hotel room you could always go downstairs and get some mediocre pancakes.   I would give it just 1 star...but they allow dogs so I will give them 2 just because it always sucks trying to find a place to travel when you have your pooch.

BW3 in Arizona????  OMG! I am so pumped. Nothing is better than chilling at a BW's on a saturday getting ready to watch your favorite college football game.  They have huge tv's, huge selection of beers and some of the best wings ever (imo). You think hooters has good wings...make a trip to bw's and you'll never go back!  You must try the spicy garlic sauce it is delish. My mouth salivates just thinking about it.

Another new city....another annoying task of finding a good nail place to do my pink and white nails (and a pedicure too).   Boy...I think I lucked out this time!   Super Pauline's was great. It was really clean and everyone was really nice.  My nails look fabulous and I know they have coupons too. nice!!!  I will be coming back!

I am in tempe for a few weeks with my pup for work. I was searching for a close dog park so I could take Toby the dog for some playtime while on a short break.  I was lucky enough to find this park that was less than a mile from where we are at ASU. Toby was very excited!  The fenced in area is decent size and has several park benches and tables . They also have a nice water fountain with a doggie dish for your thirsty doggy. Plastic poop bags are provided and the park is lighted after dark.  The couple times we have gone it has been full of very nice playful dogs!
