Over-rated! 2 hour wait on a Wednesday. Service sucked.(1 server rolled his eyes on my wife while we ordering) really? After we wait for 2 hours I expext better service and food! Pizza is ok not worth the wait and the hassle.

Food is bland! This is the 2nd time here... The worst among the fox concept restaurants. Never coming back. Go North instead!

Best service and price! Nice family owned and operated business. Not sure about them at first because the price was too good to be true but they did a great job for a whole lot less $$$

The food was not good. Had the corned beef hash and it was bland. I asked for over easy eggs and they were over cooked. The price for the food is over rated. You need to make a change In your kitchen or your doors will close in 6 months tops!?or maybe less...
