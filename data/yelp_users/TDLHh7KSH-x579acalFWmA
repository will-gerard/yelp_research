I'm sitting here waiting for my food. How can I give a 5 star review without even tasting my food? Because I was asking if the dish I ordered had any meat or dairy products in it and she assured there was none, and before giving me my food she mentioned it had eggs and if I was ok with that. She said the noodles had eggs, and I said that the website said it had rice noodles. She had the dish 're made for me without a question so I would leave happy. Thank you so much for the kindness and consideration!     Bonus, free side of egg rolls for my husband!

I have always heard about this place and how great it was. I finally went and I had the veggie vibe sandwich. All of the vegetables had a great marinade, very tasty. Their sweet potato fries are great, in between soggy and crunchy. I will definitely be going back.

I came in today just for jewelry. I needed a little more complex jewelry to accommodate my piercings. I had Sheri (Shirley, Shari...I have horrible hearing). She was super sweet and helped me so much. I really appreciate the fact that she even called one of the jewelry manufacturers and got some awesome information for me for future jewelry ideas. Thank you HTC for always being awesome!

I've been to Tum Nak Thai so many times I lost count. My boyfriend and I usually get the same thing. He gets the number 40, which is some kind of noodles. They are really good, especially when spicy. I usually get their Pad Thai, extremely good. Extra peanut taste, how I like! Their Won Ton soup is great, and it's not mostly broth like some places. Egg drop soup is amazing, too! The portions are on the bigger side, but not huge. Should fill you up no problem!

Ive been coming here for over 3 years now. I have quite a lot of options gathered, all of them have been extremely consistent.   Pros: Doctors are nice and helpful.  Assistants are great at blood draws and pleasant, kind.   Cons: Absolutely horrible communication regarding payments and insurance.  Doesn't charge you correctly and then expects me to pay the difference even though it was their fault.  Front staff is rude and does not know how to explain anything regarding insurance.  Never told me there was a check in time AND an appointment time.  Never calls back when they say they will.  Can't keep track of client history.  Has told me that they haven't gotten my results back even though I got a letter in the mail saying that it was ready.  When I actually apparently have results ready they say up to 2 weeks for them but it's really 6-8 weeks.  Almost always a 20 minute wait or more after your appointment, and usually another 15 sitting in the room waiting for a doctor.  Set up a payment plan (because THEY charged me incorrectly for months) only to fill out paperwork again because they 'forgot' to tell me there was a minimum monthly charge.   And to top it all off, I was prescribed something that was 100mg, only to get a call 14 days later saying I was supposed to be prescribed 25mg for 14 days and then supposed to take the 100mg after that. Is my mental health really that much a priority to them? I doubt it.   Also, thanks for going weeks (multiple times)  without calling my boyfriend back who needed insulin to live.   Obviously I will be finding a new doctors office.

Unfortunately this place is horrible. When Tryst Caf√© opened up 3 years ago or so it was amazing, everything was great. For some reason maybe management changed, new staff, who knows...it's horrible. I found more than 3 hairs in my food, the service was extremely slow despite the fact that there were only 3 tables filled. I took my parents there because it was (I thought it still was...) awesome, and it was quite a disappointment.

As for breakfast, 5 stars. Amazing, huge portions, SO cheap, great service and home-y feel to the place. As for the lunch....more like 3 stars. Portions are fine, but the options just aren't great.

I got the chai. Good, pretty strong, but sadly mostly ice.

I'm not a sports person, and I loved this sports bar. The food is really good, and decently priced. I had a chicken sandwich with swiss and avocado on a gluten free bun. I got veggies on the side. Everything was really, really good. The burgers are huge, and delicious. I will definitely be returning!

I LOVE sprouts. I love everything about sprouts. They have an awesome drink selection, their sandwiches are huge and only $3. Always have great produce, I have never found one fruit fly or smushed piece of fruit. I have nothing bad to say, at all, whatsoever.

I would have given 5 stars if the office front staff (NOT the providers, they are very well informed) was better. They seem extremely unknowledgeable of the procedures, don't seem to know much at all about anything besides booking an appointment. They are nice, but I think they could do better at their job considering it has to do with such a serious part of life.  I DID give 4 stars because I see Amy, who is absolutely wonderful. She made me feel so relaxed and was great with my biopsies and procedures. Where ever she goes, I will go. Dr. Kels preformed my LEEP procedure and he did a great job, extremely knowledgeable (the both of them) and made me feel comfortable.  If you can handle the front desk being a little uninformed, I would definitely recommend iWomens Health Care.

I feel odd writing a review about a grocery store, but here it goes. I love winco, the employees are all really kind and helpful. The prices are just right. Meat is good, even the seafood. I usually get their salmon patties and they are seasoned perfectly. What I don't like is their produce. Their vegetables are perfectly fine, but they almost always have a horrible fruit selection. Other than that, I go here quite often.

This place is pretty good. They have a great variety of mimosas...which I am completely okay with. They portions are normal, service is a little slow (Obviously during breakfast), it is usually packed every time I go here. Priced just right.

I live so close to this place, and I want to love it so bad. Unfortunately, after 3 times being here, I will not go back. Here's why. Pros: Food was edible  Awesome mimosa selections Cons: Slow service Don't know how to poach an egg Coffee is HORRIBLE Hollandaise sauce is pickly  We will not be returning. Go to village inn or black bear diner.

Everything I've had here is great! Mighty bowl, veggie sandwich, French onion soup, blueberry date muffin, and I'm in love with their iced tea!   I really love the atmosphere. Quiet, relaxing music. The art on the walls are beautiful. The owners and staff ate all very nice, informative and kind hearted.  The only suggestion would be to put the bread on the side, not actually IN the soup! I was looking forward to just the bread and it made the taste of the soup not as enjoyable. Soggy bread :(

Not bad, not great. Really nice people work here, service was super quick. Portions were small, the taste of the rolls weren't that out of the world. Normal. Not worth the price, though.

I had the rolled spinach wraps. They were really, really delicious! There were two downsides. The first being they were extremely high in sodium, as I looked up the nutritional information. The second being the portion size was small, the side of veggies were bigger than the whole wrap itself. I would recommend going here if you're trying to eat a little better, but keep in mind the sodium was a little ridiculous!

When I first saw that a new kind of Bosa Donuts was opening up down the street from my house I was so excited! Unfortunately they never have donuts... How ridiculous is that? I have gone over 5 times and every single time they have been out of glazed donuts and basically everything else besides donut holes and this one last time that I went they literally had no donuts only beverages. I'm extremely disappointed because I want to support both because of how awesome the donuts are when they have them but I am just going to stop going all together because I am just wasting my time by trying to get donuts at the donut shop that doesn't have any.

I've been a loyal customer of Teharu for years now, my boyfriend would always bring me to the one in Tempe and it was awesome. I live in east mesa, so it was always a question of if we were willing to go the distance. We were SO excited to find out there was one opening up right down the street from us. This one is even better than the Tempe location. Their rolls are fatter and I can taste a freshness difference. Don't let a revolving sushi bar scar you, this place is to die for. Not to mention the awesome prices.
