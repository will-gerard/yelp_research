I like this Subway.  It's newly remodeled and if you go after 12:30 you beat the lunch rush.,  It's always been clean when I go in and the workers seem to stay, not a super high turnover.  They are always super nice too.

I love this place!  The food is ALWAYS fabulous and healthy.  The art on the walls is changed out monthly and the staff always friendly.  A great place to chill with a book or the New Times over lunch, they are not open for dinner.  The Prince of Thai's Wrap, is the best and the pasta salad is the best I have ever had.  No mayo !  Also, you can get a "frequesnt visitor" card and after 9 meals get the 10th one free, which trust me, does not take long!  5 stars, always :)

I went to Guanaquito Saturday afternoon to get some to go pupusas.  We live within walking distance of the place, and honestly, from the front of the building facing McDowell it looks like nothing at all. I would see this place driving by and be like" How the hell does a restaurant survive there?". Thankfully, I ran along the place on Yelp!   Wow. I can't believe I was not more daring before now. I got 4 pupusas to go for my husband and me. While waiting, I noticed that the place is very clean and reminds me a lot of some restaurants in Mexico (although not a Mexican restaurant).   The man who took my order and money was very nice and he explained how to put the sauce and slaw on them if I so wished. I didn't like the sauce or slaw once I tasted them but, who cares, you don't need it.   We got the pork and cheese pupusas and they were out of this world! So fresh and yummy. Two pupusas each was a nice little lunch along with a beer (at home). The place needs to get beer is the only thing lacking!   We will be going back and it will be nice to be able to walk over!

I love this dentist too.  Everyone in the office is very pleasant.  The doctor does not hound you for payments, which is nice, as dental can be expensive as we all know. The office is nice and updated, very clean,  If you are looking for a new dentist, go here.  Request STEVE as your hygenist.  He is the best but is only there on Thursdays.  There is another rmale hygenist there, just take my advise and make sure you ask for STEVE.

We went last night.  If you want to drink Greek beer, ask what they have, it's not all on the menu, which is kind of cool.  We had Marathon and Mythos, preferring the Mythos.  We got to saganaki, which is good, $9 which I thought a little pricey but it was very good.  We also got the Mushroom stuffed with crab appetizer, tasty as well and they give you 6 big schrooms.  The Greek salad is very diverse, the dressing is not my favorite Greek dressing but it still was plenty tasty.  Finally, we shared the Fantasia plate $22, it is a sample of everything and everything was good.  The lamb was very tasty and we really liked the Greek lasagne.  I don't know if they have the band and belly dancer every night but last night they did and that was really fun.  So for dinner and a show the place is worth it even if the dishes are a little higher than most Greek places.   The owner, don't know his name, is very excited that you come to his restaurant, which is a nice touch :)

First Watch is good for a light breakfast as they really don't pile on the food.  The food is good though and the service is good too.

I have been going to Mi Patio for about 8 years. Yes, many boyfriends accompanied me and now my husband ;)   The place is CONSISTENTLY GOOD. Which you cannot say for a lot of places. I almost always, for 8 years, have gotten the spinach chimi with feta cream sauce. Yummy! It comes with rice but I always get rice and beans as I like to mix em!   I have also gotten their chicken guacamole tacos here too, they are good as well, tons of fresh guac!   My husband gets the spinach enchiladas as he dares to be different from me, he loves them as well.   The margaritas are cheap, not a lot of alcohol, but refreshing none the less and two of the big ones do suffice, I think they are $2.75.   The chips are not my favorite but the salsa, albeit mild, is super tasty and always fresh. The service is usually good and sometimes the server will bring you free fruity shots for dessert. The sort of shot is never known, it's free, I don't ask, never has a roofie in it.   Love Mi Patio!

Been a fan since it was May's Best of the West!  The food is consistently good, therefore, I don't mind the higher prices, they are proud and rightfully so.  The Parisian Omelette and the Eggs Maximillan (with or without chorizo) are my favorites.  I love the salsa they make and the biscuits and gravy rock too.  The service is usually pretty good!

I bought my Schwinn Cruiser SS here a little while ago.  The owner is the salesperson who helped me.  Very knowledgeable and very friendly.  Comeptitive pricing.  The service dept is good too as I had extra accessories installed on another cruiser I own there, very friendly and they let you know exactly how much it's going to cost you and not mess around.

Ticoz used to be good.   The mojitos are good but there are better out there for less money.  What ever happened to Mojito Mondays?   They used to have these cinnamon flautas on the menu, they were the only reason I went to Ticoz, everything else, you can get elsewhere which means, nothing special.  So they took the flautas off the menu, then they put them back on but changed them. I decided to give them a try, they were so not the same (they were bland and gross) and included a hair, nice touch!   The salsas are decent but the chips always taste stale.   There is one server there that is extremely full of herself and I always seemed to be in her section, so that was yuck too.  She made the whole experience uncomfortable.  There are better places out there that stay consistent. The only consistency at Ticoz is their stale chips.

I absolutely love this place and it's darkness!!  Favorite pasties:  Vegetarian balsamic mushroom with mozzerella, spinach, and a side of marinara.  Peppered steak, the blue cheese in it makes it!  And for dessert the pb&j with banana!  GREAT BEERS!

We went for thr first time today, no dogs, but it was early and not hot yet, oh well.  People are obviously not cleaning up after their dogs and no grass, only gravel?  We won't be back.

A-1 Key Service was referred to me by a neighor.  Jeff came out 2 hours after my call to them.  He went above and beyond, after hours, to fix my lock problem.  A-1 was also 25% less in cost than what 3 other locksmiths quoted me over the phone.  Finally, good service in this town!

I like the salads here and the soup is pretty good.  Sandwiches are consistenty good EXCEPT for the BLAND Thai Wrap, just don't get it, not tasty.  The location is always clean and the General Manager, female, can't remember her name is beyond accomodating for whatever you need, which is really nice.  She was able to show me nutritional value of what I ordered as i'm counting my calories.  Service here is always very fast too, which is nice, regardless of how long the line is it goes fast!

I tell ya, we have been to Hazelwoods A LOT.  But after last night and the continuous nights of crappy service, it was our last.  The place is half full and you get service as if they were both slammed and understaffed, it makes no sense.  Last night we constantly saw the girl we thought was our server (not sure as she never came back) constantly going towards the bathroom.  Hmmmmmm.  It's not like she was going to a stockroom then coming back with supplies.    We loved Hazelwoods because it's a good place to watch a sporting event, the food is good, the wings are good but not hot enough, (even the suicide are like medium), and the beer selection is good.  These things, however, are overshadowed by the crap service. The waitstaff, consisting of all females, is just the worst.  We have spent too many occassions either never having a server approach our table or once they do, they never come back.  When they drop off your food, then never ask if you want anything else or check back to see how the food is.  When they drop off the check they do not ask if they can get you anything else or if you need something else they will gladly get it.  They do not refill waters, even when you have downed 4 steins of beer, they simply do not care to get or refill anything that is not making the check grow.  I'm a former server of many years, am I too criitical?  No.  I simply knew how to get better tips out of my customers.  Too many times my husband and I have been irritated in Hazelwoods rather than having a good time, that tells me no more visits there.  Bye bye Hazelwoods.

I pretty much love this place.  AND the retro lighting!  The fresh spring rolls are really REALLY good and the lemon grass and shrimp soup, Tom something!  The pad thai is good, I've had better but it's not bad here.  The service is good and so is the 2 for 1 beers before 6 pm.  I can walk from my house which is another plus! Glad to have good Thai close to home. Prices fair.

We went again last night.  I like the if you go between 3 and 6 pm 2 for 1 beers, hell yes!  Finally had the Pad Thai, it was good, not the best I have ever had (in Thailand) but a good Pad Thai.  Honestly, they put TOO MUCH chicken in it!  But how can anybody complain on something like that?  I can't, I just took it home for the pups, they like spicy food :)  The fried bananas and ice cream dessert is good, I am going to request they put honey on the bananas next time, and I'll BYO just in case they don't have it ;)

The place has nothing to boast, other than being in a cute old house, that's it.  The beers are very expensive and the food sucks BOTH times we have gone there.  I will go back one more time as I have a 25% off coupon that includes beer, so we'll just have beer even though they have IPA only in the bottles and its about $1.50 more than most places.  I'd rather go to the George and Dragon honestly.

I like the Tempe location better but this one is good too!  The church pews do kick ass.  Favorite pasties:  Vegetarian balsamic mushroom with mozzerella, spinach, and a side of marinara.  Peppered steak, the blue cheese in it makes it!  And for dessert the pb&j with banana!  GREAT BEERS!
