This is hands down my favorite place to go for tacos! Anybody I have ever taken with me enjoys it just as much as I do. Every time I go I leave completely satisfied- I'd recommend it to any one!

I went here last week for the first time for a mid week brunch and the food was great! The menu was huge, filled with endless choices. My bagel was a little on the toasty side but other than that everything was absolutely delicious!  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. However, one of the hostesses was very rude- couldn't catch her name but she was a very thin brunette. We were originally seated outside on the patio but realized soon enough that it was covered in little ants. When we asked to be reseated inside she rolled her eyes, let out a big sigh and mumbled "ya" and pointed to a table (didn't even walk us over to it!) As we ate I continued to watch her mannerisms and attitude with other customers only to find that she was very rude with them as well. She would walk much farther ahead of the guests, turning around with an annoyed glare and stance if they were not right behind her. She never once smiled. Perhaps she was having a bad day but I was still dumbfounded by her attitude and lack of customer service skills. Hopefully management takes notice because there's a lot of restaurants with great food but great customer service is what makes a place stand out from the rest.

I loved this place! Went for the first time last night- 50 cent drafts everyday from 3 pm to 11! Best deal around ASU. I haven't tried the food..yet, but I hear great things! On Thursdays they have $1 sides and everything on the menu over all seems to be reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and laid back- I will definitely spread the good word as well as return!

Poor poor service. Sassy server..got better as the night went on but not the best first impression. Food wasn't bad flavor wise. Very small tacos, Tortas had barely any meat.. Much better food in the area with attentive servers and fair food for price
