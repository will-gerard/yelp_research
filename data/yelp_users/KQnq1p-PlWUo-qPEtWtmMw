Have you ever gotten to a restaurant and then wanted to stab yourself in the hand with a fork? Me neither.  This was my reaction to chilis. I don't ever remember this local neighborhood joint being tasty, but the boyfriend and I edge starving and decided to give it a whirl.   Our whirl was consistent of waiting in the lobby for over 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledgments us. Not sure where she was but we waited patiently. As a side note, it was 9 pm, and we were the only folks on the lobby.  When we finally got our table, the table was still wet from being cleaned. This does not feel good when one is wearing shorts. The menus were disgusting. They were sticky, ripped, faded, food stuck on gross.  Needless to say we actually walked out of the restaurant.  One star only because I cant put zero and the waitress didn't ask us to pay for our iced tea.

I've been coming to this library for over 10 years. I really like it. The location is great, I can charge my car at the blink station while I'm looking at books and its open late.

I always have the hardest time at car wash facilities because I feel like the cleaning is always sub par, no matter what *package* I purchase.  I have dogs, and my dogs have lots of hair. They don't call them German shedders for nothing. So when I pay $25 plus for a car wash, I'm really wanting them to vacuum the car really well. That's never the case. Apparently, the only way I can get my interior dog hair under control is if I get another interior detail package.   Also, how hard is it to wipe a dashboard? I always have to remind them to wipe the dashboard and console. At this point, I could have saved myself a grip of money and done it myself.  Also, watch out for the coupon specials. Not all the employees know how to honor them and will try to charge you for something else entirely

I used to like coming to this car wash because it was the only one near me. Now, their car wash prices are a lot higher for lousy cleaning. Also, when you first pull up to select your car wash, I feel as if I'm at a used car sales lot. The employees are incredibly pushy to upsell you on a simple car wash. I can't say I will be returning anytime soon.

I've been coming to Paradise Nails since it has opened. I get my eyebrows done here regularly and what a fantastic job. I've never had an issue. Sometimes the wait is a little long, and their prices have gone up a bit for other services, but I will continue to come here for my eyebrows.

Oh donut, how I love thee.  Rainbow donuts has the best donuts (I've had thus far). I really like how they offer the classic donuts, but they also have new flavors all the time.  My favorite is the cherry fritter, and they are very generous on the size!   Their prices are good also, not too pricey, but more expensive than the grocery store. However, quality counts here!  I would recommend this place to anyone who loves donuts or whoever wants to try a new place.

To say the pizza & wings here is amazing would be an understatement! This place is great. It's small, not fancy, but it's a great atmosphere. They have live music on the weekends, and it can get loud.  The only downside is that the wait staff is a little slow. Since they are so busy, i'm not sure if it's due to lack of staff or just . . well, being busy. The wait staff is wonderful however. Always happy and willing to help you.  Another sad thing is, even though Fatso's delivers, they miss my street (Union Hills) by ONE LIGHT!!! So I will forever have to pick up my delicous food, which is also ok to see their happy faces!

If your lookin for a good price, and not so much quality, then yea. This is definitely the place for you. Unless you are drunk, then I'm sure it tastes awesome.  I've never had a good pizza from here, the toppings fall off before you can even pick to your slice.  We usually pick up our own pizza since its on the way, but the pizza seems like its been sitting out longer than the allotted 25 min.  Also, the chicken *poppers* are more like chicken nuggets, and not tasty at all.

Working in a medical office, its sometimes difficult to find that perfect outfit to wear everyday. Just kidding.   This store is great! Scrubs, shoes, stethescopes, you name it, they got it.  I love how the staff is super friendly and I can be in and out in 15 min or less!  The 10% off is awesome too, just don't forget your student badge or hospital badge.

I mean, it's Taco Bell. Not much to say. This building is very outdated, definitely needs an update. The food is alright, I haven't had any issues with the ordering. They aren't very busy though, so I think the workers could be nicer.

This parking lot sucks. Whoever thought of having the drive thru come through the actual parking spaces needs to go back to architecture school.   My *chicken* sandwhich was extremely over cooked and wht can I never get something that looks like the advertised photo? My order always looks thrown together.

Meh. I feel like the pizza at streets of new york is pretty plain jane.  I came here for lunch with my boyfriend, the restaurant was clean and not too busy. Actually,  it wasn't busy at all.  Our server was nice, but we didn't see much of her so when we needed something,  she was nowhere to be found.   We were pretty hungry so we started off with the garlic bread sticks. When they came out, it looked like melted cheese on hot dog buns. The bread was frozen previously,  you could tell by the way the bread reheated and tasted. The marinara dipping sauce was also very watery and tasteless.   When our pizza came out, there was so much grease on it, I was surprised.  The pizza was also pretty plain. Nothing special.   Overall,  I'd say that streets of new york is an over priced pizza place fir those who also enjoy pizza hut & dominoes.

The prices for AMC are really getting high. It's not this locations fault really, but it will cost about $30-40 for a night out at the movies. They no longer do student discounts, and there is no "loyalty" pricing discount. The STUBS program is alright, but you don't get a discount on anything. It's $13 for a year . . . and you pay full price on all services. After you spend $100 you get a $10 credit? mmmm no thanks.

I needed to get my fingerprinting done for my clearance card for the nursing program. Matt was really quick to get it done and really friendly. They also have a great price for the nursing students! I would say my experience was good, 4 stars because there isn't anyone after 3 pm to do the fingerprinting.

this is the neighborhood theater, super easy convenient location! the prices are a little high, but i guess that's the way things go. one positive thing is the loyalty cup where its only $1.50 for a refill. awesome. the seats are pretty comfortable in the theater, and always clean. no funky smells.

Are there any good stores here anymore? I remember in high school this was the hangout place, but now it seems run down and very vacant. All the good stores are gone, i.e hobby bench and they've put in a lot of cheap clothing stores. Not a fan anymore, other than the Costco I guess.

Came here for happy hour tonight with some friends thinking it was going to be a fun time. Well, not so much.  For happy hour prices, the sushi was terrific. I'm very satisfied with what we received.  What we didn't receive, was good service. I don't know what our waitresses name was and she didn't come very often to the table! We had to ask where she was a few times for service. Not good.  Also, the smoke from the tebanyaki grill was very over powering and smoked up the restrooms, which were also not cleaned up recently.

*Location has moved to the other side of the parking lot.  So I'm a little sad that after Adam sold the business it's no longer a tattoo shop.  My boyfriend loves the hair product from this place. The voo doo brew pomade gives his hair the flawless style he likes, and I love the way it smells.   There is a wait list for a cut (like a week) but again, great prices and the stylist are awesome.

I love Target, but I do not love this Target.  The employees are rude and unhelpful. I believe the older ones are even worse. The lady at the register today actually almost pushed my purse off the counter because she was top busy pushing my shopping bag into me.   I will continue to not buy from this store unless I'm in the area and desperate.

This is by far the grocery store I try to never go to. However, since its down the street, its an easy place to get a missing ingredient in a pinch.  The store itself is very worn down and just has a feeling of dirty. It's in desperate need of a remodel.  I've seen bugs, yes bugs, in the onion barrel a few times, which made me vow to never by produce here. Huge gross factor.  Also, huge creep factor, don't go here after sundown! This is when all the tweaked out folks come out from their hidey holes and bum money from people. It's really quite scary.  The only reason I have two stars is because of the convenience when absolutely needed and the Starbucks. Yea, thats about it.

Definitely not a shining star store. I always grab an iced coffee when I get my car washed, but that may be changing.   This store is located inside of cobblestone auto wash. It makes sense to have it since I'm sure lots of people are in and out, and want coffee!  The employees have no idea what they're doing. The guy actually asked me how he was supposed to make my iced latte. Are you kidding me?   Also, I came when they were pretty busy but I was definitely forgotten while waiting for my order. They took my order, but gorgonzola to make it? Very professional.   Also, don't expect to have utensils, you know, like a straw for that iced latte because they are out of it and I ended up getting one from the soda machine station.

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. They offer such great services to the valley, I cannot begin to thank them enough.   Spaying/neutering your dog/cat is so so important, and altered tails makes it more affordable so hopefully responsible pet owners will come here.   They also offer low cost vaccines which is another bonus for your beloved pet.

When I say no tomatoes, that means NO tomatoes on ANYTHING!  I come here with el boyfriendo when neither of us wants to cook, but he wants to indulge his taco heritage.   I love the super nachos, especially when they don't put tomatoes in it. Insert EXTREME food allergy.   I don't think I've ever left the drive thru in under 15 min, or drove away with my food order correct. Sadness.  So because the special guy in my life has never had an ordering problem, and because once I pick all traces out of my meal, I award two stars.

Took mom here for a late birthday lunch, but was a little skeptical since a few people have told me the food was not very good. When we got to the restaurant, we entered across from the hostess booth, so we walked across the inside of the restaurant. Very nice layout, bright colors, and you could see everything that was going on in the kitchen. Very impressive. The only thing that was a little off was the hostess station. There was no real order, and a lot of people were just standing around. I flagged down the hostess, who didn't know if she was supposed to be seating people or if someone else was. We opted for the patio since we could be seated right away.  Our server was amazing, and he reminded me a lot of our friend in Portland. He knew the menu in and out, and also new the portion size of the street tacos probably wouldn't fill up my boyfriend. Just an over all great server.  The food was amazing also. We started off with the hummus, worth it. Very flavorful and the texture was not watery or smooth. Loved it. We also got the specialty drinks, a little pricey, but also very good. When our food came out, it was again, all very delicious.   All in all, we most likely would come again. The prices are a little high, ($90 for 4 people, no alcohol) but since the food is made healthy and also packs a flavor punch, I guess it's worth it.

great for happy hour, not so sure about the dinner menu though.  the sushi is so tasty and you can get a lot of it for an even better price! plus the premium drinks are also half priced which means you can also get loaded without paying too much. hmm. can you tell why i came here?

I come here once a month for the eyebrow waxing. The staff is professional and quick. It's actually not as painful as regular waxing in a nail salon, and I think the results last a lot longer. Plus, the employees understand exactly what I'm saying. The price is kind of high though, and they are pushy on the "packages" which kind of stinks. But all in all I will keep coming here for sure.

Meh. Not a fan. Sister and I came here after a day of shopping at Norterra. We were famished and super excited for some pita delicious-ness. The restaurant was packed, people were waiting in random spaces so it was hard to tell who had already put their name down or now. We ended up going to the bar.  Our server was super nice and knew a lot about the menu, which was good. The one thing I noticed right away, was that the servers, or employees seemed to all be half dressed. I don't have kids, but there were kids there, and it seems like this is a family enough style restaurant so that was unprofessional to me.   When our food came, I had been so excited to try the falafel pita but when I saw it, I wanted to cry and my stomach started to riot. The falafel was burned and bone dry. Made me thirsty just looking at it. and holy onions. There were so many onions, no sauce. just ick.   We didn't stay long after that. Most likely won't go back.

I was a little skeptical at first to try this place out considering tg e first time we went there the power was out so they were closed.  The next time I came was during the lunch rush, and they had it pretty under control. The only thing I didn't like, was the way the tables were set up. Not very much room for a party greater than two. And also, the table was sticky.  The food was tasty. I ordered the gyro special, and it was very fresh & tasteful. It was very hot though (not complaining!!) so I had to wait about 10 min to eat it.   Definitely would recommend and go again.

I really wanted to like this place, I had bookmarked it a while back and when the dinner opportunity came up I was super stoked. It's not too far from my house, and the prices didn't look to bad. Plus, they had a happy hour. Score!  When we got there, it wasn't too busy, which is good. There must've been a memo I didn't get about screaming children though. I'm all for family restaurants, but this restaurant is actually pretty tiny, and the tables are smooshed together. We had the lucky opportunity to sit next to the loudest of the kids, so the first half of our visit was not great.   Our waitress, that's another review all on its own. I don't know why, but I have an issue with restaurant dress codes. I don't need to see a girl wearing shorts so short that the bottom of her bum is sticking out. This was pretty much all of the female staff. She greeted us right away, which was good, but then it took about 10 minutes for ice water . . . then she only took one alcohol order. I had said I wasn't sure what I wanted, but she didn't come back for another fifteen or so minutes. That was annoying. She was pretty absent from then on. refills were sporadic, so we had to hold on to what we had. Not sure when the next refill would come.  When we finally got to ordering (I'll admit it took us awhile because we are pretty chatty) I was famished. I ordered mac n cheese (duh) and everyone else ordered a burger. The mac n cheese I ordered had broccoli and chicken in it, my favorite combination. However, when the mean came out, for some reason there was no chicken in it . . . and the cheese had hardened on the top, which makes me think it had been sitting for a while before being brought out. The waitress noticed I had no chicken, so she brought me out a piece on grilled chicken on a side plate. This was the tiniest, thinnest, piece of 'chicken' i've ever seen.  The food was tasty however, so no complaints (minus no chicken and cold mac n cheese).  All in all, probably would come again, but not for beer, it was very expensive, (between 4 of us, we had bout 12 beers and it was $90 during happy hour?). I also would probably not recommend it unless you are prepared for the unwatched screaming children and over priced beer.

I know it was only $7 for the wash but it left worlds to be desired. Might as well have sprayed the car with the hose & called it good. Sure it got the dirt off but that's it. Bird poop/bug nasty still stays.

I'm pretty sure this pei wei was built for the good employees of Vanguard.  Went here for a quick lunch with sister, the place was busy which was nice. The only thing that wasn't nice was how incredibly loud it was inside. I could barely hear my sister talking from across the table, but I could definitely hear all the financial complaints from fellow financial service employees.  The food left a bit to be desired. O ordered my usual orange peel chicken, but what I ended up with was something along the lines of orange peel and vegetables. Maybe 4 pieces of chicken. Really?  The service was quick, but not friendly. The drink station was a mess. Probably won't be re visiting.

This particular sprouts market used to be the local sunflower market. I'm very happy it was converted into a sprouts, since now I don't have to drive down to the paradise valley location!  I also enjoy this location because its never overly busy. I don't have to wait forever in line. The store is very clean and easily layed out. The prices are good and shopping here helps support local farmers

I was a little skeptical at first because its a little hole in the wall restaurant. I think it's family owned & operated. The inside was small and had three tables, but there was damage done to the tables. There isn't a waiter or anything, you order at the window and you're pretty much on your own after that. After my experience, I have to say, it was very delicious.  The golden wings were boneless, not over cooked and the sauce was so tasty! Not sure if this was a home made sauce, but it sure was good. The cheese steaks were good, definitely greasy and filling. I could agree to their award winning.  The only down side, was that this place was pricey. For what the food was, it shouldn't have been so pricey.

A new pizza place by work, yay!  I was very excited to try out this place for lunch, and I thought the food was very yummy.  Even though its called giant rustic PIZZA, they offer salads and sandwhiches as well.  Their specialties pizzas are a bit higher pricing than I was expecting, but the lunch specials are a good price.

Im with the rest of the folks on here, in the fact that I really can't say enough good things about this place.   It has a modern but rustic atmosphere, that just flows. I guess if I had to complain about anything it would be that the hostess dress was so short I thought it would just roll up at any second and give the restaurant a show. Very unclassy and not appropriate attire.   But, now to the good stuff!   Get the bacon board. Its literally a wooden block with different flavors of bacon. Don't even think about it.Just order it.  The moonshine will also give your body an unpleasant kick in the face, but its good! The martinis were also fantastic. Great happy hour pricing and a really neat place overall.   Would definitely stop by again next time we're in Phoenix.

I wish I could give this a zero star, but a 1 star will have to do. We booked our car rental online about a week before our trip. Firefly was the least expensive for the mid size car, so we went with that. After our journey from Portland, OR to Phoenix, AZ, we went to check in for our car rental. Except, that part didn't happen. The girl who was supposed to be checking us in was not there. Nor did she show up after twenty minutes of us standing there waiting for her to show up. So, no show from the attendant led us to renting from Thrifty car, which cost us more money than we had originally been quoted from Firefly. Really frustrating. Won't even try to rent again in the future.  Anyways, I guess if you want to see my true car rental experience, see what I ended up writing for Thrifty car rental.
