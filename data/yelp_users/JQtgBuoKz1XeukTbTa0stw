It's worth the wait just for the orange juice - but the food is good too.  The boys went camping, so my daughter and I woke up early and headed downtown for the farmer's market and some breakfast. We stopped at Matt's long enough to put our name on the list and then ventured across the street to meander through all the local wares. We took our time and when we came back, we met and visited a couple of moms who had brought their daughters all the way from Calgary to try this place. (wow)  Here's what we figured out about the wait: it's about 30-40 minutes per page of names ahead of you... (ish) Two pages of names ahead of us when we signed in = 1 hour 10 minutes total wait on the day we went.  Once inside, I loved the quaintness of the place ( and our service was superb. It's also obvious that they recognize people who have been in before and sometimes even know their names.  Being somewhat indecisive, we ordered the cheese omelet and the belgian waffle and shared. The omelet had just the right amount of cheese, making it a perfect accompaniment to the oh-my-gosh! fabulous wheat toast with locally made strawberry preserves. The hashbrowns were nothing to get excited about, but in the nirvana of the previously mentioned last bite, who cares?!?  But wait. Then I tried the waffle.  One of my best friends and I make waffles all the time - and have been making them for years. She's know for hers. I'm really sorry, dear friend, but Matt's has you beat. Their belgian is the ultimate experience of amazingness with just the right combination of being fluffy without being soggy. Add the 100% maple syrup and I'm good... so very very good. There's no need for the sweet cream butter - but it's there if you want it.  If they could pick the perfect orange at the moment of ultimate ripeness and squeeze it into a glass, you might be able to imagine the essence of every sip of the juice we drank. Just for kicks, we ordered the honey lemonade. Not really a breakfast beverage, but a must have for when we go back for lunch.  Go knowing that you will wait and that it will be worth every minute. Definitely looking forward to going back.

When in doubt, take a recommendation from some of the regulars.  The chicken salad sandwich is to die for. Well, maybe not actually, really, die for... but I'd drive there and pay full price for it.  Other reviewers are right -- this place is a bit pricey if you are on a budget -- but the way to get around that is to go for the daily special. For right around $6 you are out the door with your huge sandwich; a choice of chips, potato salad or coleslaw; and a drink. $1.50 buys you a giant chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  The other secret is that they sell their bread (if they have any left) after 2 pm. I'm still waiting to get a loaf of their sourdough to make into french toast on the weekend.

Do you ever tell yourself you are going to try something new...and then you order the same thing you always get AGAIN?  At Sacks, my art of sandwicherie is the Symphony. Turkey, avocado, bacon, sprouts, on 12-grain bread that is nothing short of deliciousness.  YUM.  Forget about the cookies and the chips or the fact that I absolutely love their lemonade... and focus here, people.   The sandwich is divine.  There is a great place in Salt Lake City called Skool Lunch...I used to eat there all the time when I worked downtown...and with all of the fabulous delis in the Phoenix-metro area, I haven't found anything that got it just right.  Until now.  Recommended by a friend who did her undergrad at ASU, I stopped in to give it a try. Nothing fancy and the service is average...but the sandwich was nothing short of incredible.  They have lots of great choices, but I know myself. Know myself well. I'll pretend like I'm going to get something else, but when it comes down to it, um uh yeah...we know what I'm going to do.  I'll be in Tempe again next week. See you then.

Have you taken a minute to watch the sunset lately?  I had the best view from the patio at the Yelp mixer tonight. Very cool.  I only had a ginger ale tonight (call me a cab already), but my drinking friends raved about the Strawberry Smash. And from the looks of things, it was pretty popular.   But did I mention the patio?  Loved it. Comfortable. Warm (especially by the fire pit). Inviting. Great for having a conversation with new friends.  And the sunset? Fabulous.  I can't wait to go back and try dinner.

Sometimes the third try isn't the charm.   I dropped by Corner Bakery around 10:30 this morning to pick up something to take with me to work. As usual, the space was charming and clean and they had someone ready and waiting to take my order.  I decided to order something I hadn't tried before and went with the Chopped Salad. I sat down to wait. And I waited. And waited. And watched a bunch of employees standing around doing nothing. And waited. And listened to the manager whine to another employee like a sad sorority girl -- right in front of me. And waited.  If it were possible to grow lettuce in 20 minutes, I would think that's what happened because I was the only one waiting for an order (there were a couple of other people there, but they already had their food).  Ugh. Seriously disappointing. And my salad was nothing to get excited about. I enjoyed my other two visits...but there is nothing I hate worse than not knowing what kind of service I'll get on my next trip. You have to be consistent to get 5-stars in my book and with so many other choices in the area, it'll be awhile before I give them another try.

Grilled cheese with bacon? Yes. Absolutely yes.  Co-workers raved about Bacon...said they went all the time...so I went with them to try it out.   Loved the space. Open, comfy, and just a little bit kitch in an Old Town kind of way.   The menu was okay. Our server was nice. The cooks in the kitchen were creative. Very creative...and I don't mean this as a good thing.   Apparently, they didn't have enough veggies to grill for my co-worker's veggie wrap, so they um made it up. Put in what they had...which included some interesting choices. And they didn't tell anyone. It was a first-bite surprise.  Our server comped her meal...but a little head's up from the kitchen staff could have let her pick one of the other tasty creations that ended up at our table...like the breakfast burrito or the BLT.

My favorite guilty pleasure.   Order me the #9 and I've died and gone to heaven. Twice. (Once for each taco...)   Seriously yummy. Quick. Affordable. Clean. They do take credit cards...  And I haven't even mentioned their guacamole. Or their tortillas that some people drive from Paradise Valley and Scottsdale to get (people like this like to talk to you during their brief wait to get their order...).  The only downside to Carolina's is they are so CRAZY BUSY that getting a parking place or a table is sometimes a challenge (even though they offer plenty of both). Don't let this discourage you, though. Go a little early for the lunch/dinner rushes or take a bit of patience with you...you won't need much...they'll get you in and out with plenty of time to spare.

Love the butcher at this Safeway!!!  Reminds me of the butcher at the grocer we went to when I was growing up. He knows everything about every cut of meat, including the best ways to cook them...and will take the time to talk to you about it. I told him about something that hadn't turned out quite right the last time I made it -- he gave me a tip and it turned out melt-in-your-mouth perfectly.   So besides the fact that this Safeway has the same women's health mix that I used to have to drive to Scottsdale to get from Whole Foods or the fact that they have other specialty items that are cheaper than going to AJ's, it's worth the drive to Vistancia just to visit the butcher.

Looking for a tooth whisperer? We've found one.  Rick Ostler is a family dentist...but his specialty (at least in our book) is dealing with the squeemish dentist hater.   Not only do they have TVs on the ceiling, you can bring in your favorite movie to watch during your procedure. They have a treasure chest with treats for the kids and snacks for everyone in the waiting room. Instead of smelling like a dentist's office, you will be greeted with the enticing aroma of fresh-baked cookies. Yum! And if you are lucky, you might just run into Mr. Molar or the tooth fairy.  Oh. And did I mention that Dr. Ostler is a 'no guilt' dentist? Yup. No guilt. Ever. Just helps you fix what needs fixing in a very calm and gentle way. We call him the tooth whisperer. Not kidding.

I have been meaning to make the trek over to Scottsdale JUST to give these guys a try, but as luck would have it, they were parked right outside my building downtown this past Tuesday, so I had to take advantage.   CON:  Standing in a super long line in at lunchtime on the surface of the sun *cough* I mean, in downtown Phoenix during the summer *cough*  That, in and of itself, could be enough to make me grumpy and perhaps a little critical of their supposed deliciousness (I've read the reviews, folks. I had high expectations).   However, there was no grumpiness. The guys were hustling. The line moved at a reasonable rate. Somehow, I made up my mind (too many delicious things to choose from).   And then, the moment of truth...  At the end of the day, it's a burger and fries. But, HOLE-EEE COW, that is the juiciest and most flavorful burger I think I have ever had. SOOOOO GOOOOODD!!!   The fries were crisp and warm -- just like I like 'em. My only regrets -- not trying more than one aioli to dip them in (totally delish!) AND passing on the mango lemonade. (Don't make my mistake, folks. Just order the lemonade. Trust me. Your friends don't want you drinking theirs. Order your own.)  I will definitely be back. And will bring friends. And tell everyone along the way that they need to come too.
