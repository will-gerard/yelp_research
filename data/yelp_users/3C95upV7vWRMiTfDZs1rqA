I booked a three night stay with this hotel using a third party website.  That website gave an option to make the reservation without payment.  In order to make a reservation without payment I agreed to pay a higher per night rate.  Two days later I received a message from (317) 829-8646 (an Indiana number not Arizona) demanding a deposit from "Meghan".  I called the company back at 1 (800) 456-0009 and cancelled my reservation.  If Cibola Vista Resort and Spa wants to charge me 20% for a "pay at the hotel option" then they should not be seeking payment ahead of time.  If they need that payment ahead of time then they should not be using the third party website to sell their hotel.  Buyer Beware.  I would avoid making plans to stay at this hotel.

Completed a poster online.  The website says it will be ready in 4 hours.  I go to the store site 27 hours later and the store has not started on the poater.  I am giving the store a two only because of the treatment by the store clerk.  I do not plan to use this location for my future printing needs and I would suggest to others looking for a print job to look at a different location.

I have eaten hear a dozen or so times.  I enjoy the food.  Some times the service is a bit inconsistent, but never had a noticeable problem.  For the prices, the quality is hard to match.  Defiantly worth a try for anyone in the area.

Ate here for lunch today.  The service was responsive and fast.  The food was good.  All I look for in a lunch spot.

Great experience.  Wonderful ambiance.   Would recommend to anyone looking for a good salon.  Good set up for bridal parties.

Representatives give false information on a regular basis.  Avoid this store at all cost.  There is another Verizon store down the street just off of Dysart, if you have to do business with Verizon I would advise visiting there instead.  Visiting there cost me $300 due to miss information that they give.

The resolution, as Theresa has requested, is Verizon refuses to provide visual evidence (this is a copy to the broken link that they sent me http://app115.cces.vzwcorp.com/clnr/990004956592533_10202015.jpg ) of the problem and I owe an extra $300.  The store representatives say they "cannot discuss 'billing issues' (which it was not a billing issue until I received inaccurate information from the store representatives) over the phone.  Which means I have to come and wait in their show room before I can have a conversation about this.

Store is clean.  Attendents are helpful.  Convent to the freeway.   A good west valley store for plus sized ladies.

Outstanding customer service   Locally owed and a great asset to Goodyear.  The store will order any type of pet food as long as you give them enough time.  Drive through pet food is genius.

Had a great time for the moment we sat down to the time we left.  We completed a "pop your pet" class.  I sent in my photos as asked in the online description. When we arrived we were set.  Others had not sent in their photos and the instructor was able to do his scetch and get the class started.  Loved the class and would recommend it to any one looking for a relaxed painting experience.
