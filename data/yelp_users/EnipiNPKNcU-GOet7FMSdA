No Stars  No reward with this company  When you have No communication with the mechanic on the parts you agree to deliver and then deliver the wrong parts, or not the whole order you're doing bad business! And when your driver says "I don't know" what you need sir call the shop..... you don't stand by your business or to better your business. Just shrug it off and don't care about how you put others out!!!!!  If you're going to be in the customer service industry do your dang job. It's pretty simple!!!!! Communicate, execute and don't push the blame from one sales rep/ manger (uneducated personal at that) onto one another.

Honestly, best place in the valley for the traditional greek food and fare.  The owner makes the joint that much more authentic... If you fancy some greek food and are thinking about headin over the MBFG (my big fat greek) STOP!!!!!!! it is not what you really want.  Food - Spirits/beer/wine should come from people who know the language, live the life and love the culture of greece.  Greektown is this place... Best greek salad and the gyro meat is killer.  And, as Rnady G stated... it is the diamond.. The diamond in the center of town that you need to experience and you will come back.

So, after I read some of the reviews I was a little shocked but then again.  I wasn't!  I wasn't shocked because I too have been to a few places where I did not like the first meal, but saw that I like the place, liked the staff and environment.  So, I re-read the reviews again.  And, the only one that stands out (because I like wine) was Marks review... not because it was negative... it was not accurate.   "Two of us shared a small bottle of merlot wine ($14).   It poured two glasses of medium quality wine.  It was just OK.  For $7 a glass I was thought it should have been better."  First they do not have a Merlot 1/2 bottle.  Second if they did and you were drinking merlot, half the time its barley assisting the food in the pairing.  & third the wine selection they have is super (go for the primus-it killer)!  The Half bottles concept is great.  You can share the bottle with a friend, sip it by yourself while enjoying the "create your own salad" (which is the best way to "shock your taste buds with great, quality add on's that you would never try at home) or while enjoying a slice with a friend or 2.  Now back to the wine.  And, if you are sipping BYS and you like the wine, you can take it home, while only paying 12.00 not $24.00 + for a full bottle.... all the wines are under $12.. That is awesome....  Will I return to Market Bistro? For sure I did last night.  I had the Arizona Tri-tip, side of Mac-n-cheese, and One bottle of the Primus- 2005 Red blend from Chile.  A great balanced wine, with bold, ripe fruits and lively red tannins that went perfectly with the sired Arizona tri-tip!  I had two small glasses and went home for the night.... Around 930 I polished the Primus off and today here I sit - thinking.... I might go back on Thursday.  This time with a friend!

Immediately walking in you are greeted and whisked away to your seats (I sat at the bar actually bypassing the Hostess- they are super friendly though)! I have enjoyed many many items off the list. Free range chicken, medallions, over (10) wine dinner pairings and just a glass of wine. And that is where I am right now. No food. Just some wine. Enjoying a great glass of Cuvaison Chardonnay from Carneros... 2013 winery of the year... Try a glass won't you!!!

I'm a fan of...... Obviously the coffee! Fresh and toasted "In House!" Then there would be the wine, beer and liquor (I have a vested interest in this department)!!! Oh and I'm a huge huge fan of the breakfast sandwiches and the Maple Bacon Muffin

Well where do you start? First please ignore the grammar | spelling - I'm speeding through this on my phone....  I've been frequenting this Whiskey influencediiilliiiili Restaurant for the past two years and always feel content and joyful after my experience. The New chef has just released his first menu and he l picked up the "Rock" show casing his talents during Arizona Restaurant Week w a 3 course fixed menu. Two choices in each setting!   C1-The Beef Tartar was plentiful and delighting starter plate. Balanced, with acidity, salt and (vinegar or Horseradish) and I selected the Jeffersons Ocean Aged Whiskey - this is a "Must Have" if you enjoy unique and amazing American whiskey's C2- I went w/ the obvious choice a 5 spice crepe filled with Pork Belly and truffle oil- such a typical heavy course but the crepe and sauces dressed the dish amazingly well. I heard that C2 option #1 the Ravioli is extremely on point as well. C3- I didn't go with the I obvious first choice the "Charred Hanger Steak." Instead I did the Double Fried Chicken and Crumpet with Bourbon (yes, bourbon) maple syrup!!!! This is total play on Chicken and Waffles- yet refined and delighting, hearty and filling, sweet and a hint of tang!! I paired this with the Berheim Wheated Whiskey / 90 proof / with hints of butterscotch- Toffee- cinnamon and white pepper  Can't wait to see the new menu release this up coming week  Oh and the cocktail selection?  It's amazing! Flanked left to right, ceiling to the floor with over 100 whiskeys and an array amount of the others to play the beat of anyone's palate! Oh, when I said whiskey, John "The Whiskey Man" Christie will lead you to promised land when exploring any whisky (ey) from the main land across the Atlantic to Scotland & Ireland. Don't forget that to get your Orient Whiskey fix too!!  My favorites in no order just a biased opinion below   From across the pond - Jameson "Caskmates" Irish Whiskey  Aberlour (any) Powers Gold Green Spot  Japanese  Nikki Coffee Pot (just try it - yummmm) Hibiki   American Jefferson (any) Knob Creek Rye (my dram of choice) Elijah Craig 23 Old GRANDAD OGD!!!  ***Don't judge it's the best value bar none
