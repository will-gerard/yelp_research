I own a property managed by Osselaer for the past 8 years now and the HOA managed areas appearance are in a state of decline while HOA fees increase every year.    Most recently I have gotten a stern weed warning even though my property has very little to no weeds and has more appeal than 80% of the other properties in the neighborhood.    I am not sure if its the lack of leadership in the HOA board or Osselaer to blame for poor pool contracting and weed fines but either way they are doing a poor job.    I would give them 1 star but have been happy that Karen typically returns my call within 24 hours.

A decent airport that features free wifi, limited shopping, and average TSA employees.  The lines are seldom long and their retired people in Purple that go out of their way to help you out.  They are building a sky train which will make transportation between terminals easier.  I would give this airport a 3 but free wifi makes me have to give it a 4 :)   *insider tip: terminal 4 has showers in the bathrooms by the baggage claim

Great place to go on a nice sunny Phoenix day.  Be sure to bring a Frisbee or football to throw around and have one of the delicious soups and sandwiches.  Most locals don't know about this place and I am OK with that since it already gets crowded to the point that I have never been able to walk in and get a seat at the Cafe.  You can easily spend an hour walking around the farm and discovering a bit of Phoenix history.

A bit of a tourist trap but hey this place is fun and has a great view.  At the entrance you are greeted by a Steer and then walk down a hallway that feels like a mine shaft.  Inside there is a slide for the kids, a large bar area for us adults, a stage for a band down below, and excellent views of Phoenix from the balcony.    The food here is average but its always fun coming with an out of town-er and ordering rattlesnake for an appetizer.  If I'm with locals, we come here strictly for for a drink out on the balcony or the free happy food that they have from time to time.

The food and atmosphere in this place is amazing!  I like it that a family owned coffee shop is able to hold its own and be orignal.  I read a bunch of other reviews here on Yelp and can agree with most of them.  Parking sucks, location is fun, food is great, coffee is average.  Park by Montes for free and walk the 2 minutes over Rio Salado if you want to save a couple of bucks.  The food items taste as good as they look.  Muffins and egg dishes are a must have.  The owners are friendly, gotta warn you though, homeboy is a bit touchy feely.

I grew up close to this place and their American style Pizza and wings have always been great.  Large groups can be easily accommodated and the atmosphere is fairly laid back at Nello's.   It''s too bad the trolley doesn't go by here anymore :(

This place has great hot dogs and a strong New York feel to it. Its the best place in Phoenix for hot dogs (yes there are better hot dog places in Tucson and throughout the US). The line can get long but its worth the wait. A must try if you live in Phoenix.

This place use to be great 12 months ago when it was under a different name and management group. Now it is just plain bad food. I ordered a polle asado burrito that was just plain old nasty. I feel bad giving this place 1 star so I'll give it 2 stars since a buddy of mine frequents this place. There are half a dozen better fast food Mex places with a 1 mile radius so don't even bother with this place.

The only sushi place I go to during non happy hour times.  The sushi here is really good and affordable.  I highly recommend trying this place out.  I would give it 5 stars however the wait on a Saturday night was over an hour and staff at the time look like they could be working at a Texas BBQ place (not an insult, as they were friendly but just unexpected for a Japanese restaurant.)

This place is really as good as it gets!  All their food is good and their beer makes it the best brewery in metro Phoenix.  Try their seasonal beer selections or their beer sampler if its your 1st time visiting.    My favorite part about this place is that you can get a 24 pack of bottled beers to go for only $24.  Now if only they allowed me to bring my dog...

fun concept that tastes great.  Funny how much better subs taste when their properly toasted.  You can't help but grin at the names of the subs.    Even if you don't dig the hippie theme there is no denying that this makes a mean sandwich.

One of the best places for hippie food in the Phoenix area.  Its not 100% authentic Mediterranean but its still good.  The prices are less than fine dining but the experience and food feels like a fine dining place.  However they give generous portions and I could have easily given them 5 stars if Haji Baba's Chicken Swarma wasn't twice as good as Pita Jungle's :)  This place seems to be constantly improving their menu and is a must go to for a date or just to try it out with some friends.

The food is good and they give generous portions.  The interior is nicely furnished and has several pictures and items from Ethiopia.  Their wine selecton looks good but I have only been here for lunch.  You can't go wrong with any of their combo dishes.  One warning though, this place might make you a bit gassy...

Delicious sandwiches and soups.  I'm surprised that this place is priced about the same as Subway and Silvermines yet their food is way better.  Interior is a bit boring but hey who cares about that when you have good food!    *If you join lunch club from my ticket, you get 20% off your lunch bill here

A great hidden gem off Mill Ave!  This place has good veg/non veg healthy lunch options in a small court yard setting.  For ~$7 you will be full.  There popular chicken salad is delicious and you can't go wrong with any of their items.  I dig the free chips/salsa as well and the out door seating is good 9 out 12 months a year.  The owners and employees make this a warm friendly environment.  Styrofoam cups at a "green" restaurant is what drops them from 5 to 4 stars.

hands down best grilled chicken place in the phoenix area.  Only takes cash so be sure to bring some.  Their Carne is awesome as well.  If its your first time there try both meats.  Menu options are limited but hey who needs more?  I'm glad not that many people know about this hole in the wall place or there very much could be a line out the door for their yummy chicken!

Try their Chicken Swarma plate! Try their chicken Swarma plate!   OK now that you know that I have to say this place is good. I might be overrating it a little bit since their beef Kafka is dry but their Chicken Swarma is great! The best I've had outside of the middle east. The prices are low, the service is adequate, and the food is great. Be sure to pick up some baklava or other dessert on your way out.

There $6 lunch specials are fantastic.  Service is always good, waitresses are cute, and the place has a good positive vibe.  I might give them 5 stars after I check out their happy hour or actually go there for dinner.

From the outside this place looks like all fun and games.  $2 beer, a party atmosphere and free food during happy hour.  Whats not to like right?  Unfortunately the music is way 2 loud when you get in.  Its really difficult to have a conversation.  The free food has made me sick on more than 1 occasion.  The service is slow to the point that I usually go to the bar to order a beer.  I would give this place at least 3 stars if they turned down the music a couple of notches.

The food is best described as boring.  I've tried 3 different dishes and they all were below average at best.  One member of my party even walked out after taking a sip of his soup and a bite of his food.    Funny thing was that i went in on 4/20 once and the owner said "remember!  4/20 today, don't party 2 much!"    The interior is dated, but that isn't as big of a problem as the boring food.  I'm surprised they have been in business for soo long..  I wish I could give them 3 stars but I just can't :(

Some of the best pizza you will find in Phoenix. This place gives pizzeria Bianca and La Grande Orange an able challenger. The restaurant is small and intimate and fills up quickly during dinner and lunch. Luckily they have a take out option and you can go down the street to sleepy dog brewery to eat your pizza.   All the pizza Ive had here has been great. I particularly like the Super Six, Nicole's Favorite and the spinach pizza. I would give it 5 if they had more seating and served alcohol.

$5 cover on mill is never fun.  This place isn't all that great and I'm surprised they are still around.  Staff isn't always that friendly and drinks aren't usually that great.  For some reason I do have a tendency to meet "interesting" people here so I guess it deserves at least 2 stars.

Cool neighborhood bar set in an old Victorian style house. Supposedly this place is haunted... go up the stairs next to the bathrooms and check it out yourself. They have a good beer selection and their wings and oysters are among the best I've had in the phoenix area. Pissing on the blarney stone makes for good fun as well.   The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the emo crowd can get annoying at times and service can be a bit spotty.   I recommend this place to anyone looking to have a beer and some food in a laid back atmosphere.

Great food for a decent price that should easily get 5 stars if it wasn't for the insane amount of wait time.  My group showed up 15 minutes early for a group reservation and still had to wait 60 minutes, ridiculous!    Everything I had was delicious and I think the spinach pizza was my favorite.

Best chaat and veg. Indian food in Phoenix for really low prices!  The ordering system is a little weird (you fill out a form and bring it into the kitchen) but you can order over the phone and the food will be ready for you.    I would give them 5 stars but its a messy store and they don't have any meat options for carnivores like me.  Be sure to try their desserts as well!  I recommend bringing an Indian friend along to help with ordering.

Everything I have ever ordered from here is delicious.  The staff is friendly and the beer looks great (I don't drink during lunch :()   The restaurant is a bit small making it challenging if your in a big group.  The good food takes a bit of time and can be a little heavy for the middle of summer.  I recommend checking this place out and enjoying the unique food they have to offer.

I went with a party of 5 and we split the bill among credit cards/cash.  The waiter (Michael P) overcharged the credit cards and said it was due to the original receipt not reflecting our drink prices.  I insisted that he print out the original receipt since I needed it for company expense tracking and sure enough, homeboy pocketed the cash and overcharged us in order to get a bigger tip!  The food is ok but not really worth the price plus I refuse to go back due to Michael P pulling a fast one on us.

Friendly owner that serves good Thai food in a clean restaurant.  I ordered the Tom Yum, papaya salad, and the 304, and topped it all off with some coconut ice cream (yes I shared my food).  The hotness was dead on, I ordered hot (not thai hot) and my dish was just right.  The food had good flavor and didn't let me down.    Prices are similar to other nice sit down Thai restaurants so I don't understand all the complaints.

I received a free oil change coupon as a birthday mailer promo.  My initial thought was great, I'm sure they are going to come up with some BS charges and I will stay pay $20 for the oil change.  Thankfully I was wrong.    My appointment started on time and I was treated very well by Witness who has been working there for 15 years.  The waiting area is nice and Witness made me a fresh pot of coffee and we talked for a little while.   About 45 minutes my oil change and tire rotation was done.  He mentioned to me that  my wiper blade was worn and my K&N filter was dirty but he knew that I am the type of customer who would take care of it myself.  What really  surprised me is that my bill actually came to $0!  No tax, no shop fee, no disposal, nothing.  I asked for a belt repair quote on my gf's car and Witness called me back with a very fair quote within an hour just like he said he would.  A couple of days later a thank you card came in the mail.  Unbelievable!    It is difficult to find a honest repair shop and if you are able to find one I recommend sticking with them.  Community Tire Pros has earned my respect and I am happy to recommend them.

The best dive bar in Tempe that features Live Music with no cover charge.  All the employees here are nice and treat you with respect.  The beer is cheap and the service is good.  There is shuffle board and darts to keep you entertained between music sets.    Even though the location is a little bit dumpy it adds to the dive bar factor and keeps the douschbags away.  If your not a douschbag and want to try something different, check out this place.

Best fast food Mexican place I have been to in the Phoenix area.  Menu has great variety and their Salsa is damn good.  Go here instead of Fili B's!  So far I haven't ordered anything that I don't like.  The restaurant is fairly clean for a fast food establishment that is busy during all hours of the day/night.  Food takes a little while to cook but is well worth the wait.

This hole in the wall joint serves up some serious Mexican Seafood.  If you are missing your last Rocky Point vacation come here and you will be reminded about how great Mexican seafood tastes.    The shrimp cocktail and fish dishes all taste good.  This is the best place for Mex Seafood in the Phoenix area, which isn't saying much but hey beggars can't be choosers.  I'm just happy that I live close this gem :)

Will fill you up and not let you down. The lunch special with 3 different meats and 4 sides for $7.49? is a steal. The owners are friendly and consist ant and I like the fact that you can kick back and have a drink or 2 while your here. I would give them 5 stars, however an amazing Hawaiian place used to be located down the street and tasted even better than Paradise.. its a shame they are gone but Paradise isn't that bad of a substitute.

This place is the best American buffet in the phoenix area.  The quality of food you get here is comparable to good wedding food, fathers/mothers day buffet, or other banquet type events.  All this for only $15 which includes a drink and a wide selection of desserts.    I go here once a month and the staff is always friendly and very  professional  *insider tip: mention you are a culinary club member and they will give you an additional 20% off.

I must say I'm not a big fan of Yogurt shops to begin with however Mojo is alright.  They have 1000 different options to keep me entertained and the fresh fruit toppings are good.  The furniture and atmosphere is inviting and you could easily spend an hour just relaxing here... OK I'm changing this rating from 3 to 4 stars as I'm typing right now.  Be sure to join there online club and you will get frequent BOGO and 50% off deals.    Now if only we could get rid of 90% of the other Yogurt shops.  The yogurt bubble is bound to burst one of these days.

Cool little dive bar located at an old fire station.  The decor is interesting and the $1 shot special whenever a firetruck with sirens passes by gives this place character.  They usually have live bands during the night and their food (hotdogs, pizza, & wings) is decent and inexpensive.

Went here today for 1st time. The food was decent and the service was great for a buffet. The cool thing is that the owner Joann will make various things and the server will come out to your table and give you extras such as steak skewers. Some of the food items like the bean curry chicken dish and chicken soup are extraordinary while others such as the egg roll and rice are ok. The restaurant is best described as a whole in the wall however it is clean inside.   Joann almost didn't honor my living social coupon because her son signed her up for it and she didn't quite understand how it worked. I saw a number of people walk in and walk back out when they saw the slim offerings at the buffet. This place really needs a business manager so Joann can focus on cooking & chatting with customers.   Hopefully Joann can make the changes necessary to stay open and be successful in the competitive restaurant marketplace.

There really isn't anything special about this place.  Your run of the mill fillabertos is tastier than this place.  I have been here twice now and am willing to drive the extra 2 miles to the burrito place over on bell rd.  If you have had real mexican food you will be a bit disappointed in the  bland menu and yellow cheese they use.

Went with a group of 6 friends to the Saturday evening show.  Overall the venue and staff were decent.  The reason I have to give this place two stars is the Howard Hughes stand up routine.  I found it awful and even though the rest of the comedians were alright, HH's unfunny performance left a bad taste in my mouth.  I was unaware of this place being on bar rescue until after I went and have since watched the episode and now understand the dynamics a bit more.  I could have easily given this place 4 stars however I am giving it 2 stars because I have never seen a stand up routine sooo bad!  Its even worse when its the owner doing it and you can't boo the guy because he runs the place.  Please focus on the business and the customers during weekend shows and I promise you will have repeat business!

I ate here last night.  Overall I had a good experience.  Despite it being in the middle of summer the outdoor seating was comfortable.  Dogs are allowed outside and the waiter (possible owner) is as french as can get it.  He was very attentive to us and even the 2 dogs we brought along.  We ordered a variety of things including the flammkueche (big & tasty), veggie quiesce (I've had better), and crepes (delicious).  Overall the price was OK and our experience was good despite me feeling like they put the gas in gastronome.

I went here on a Saturday night for the first time and had a blast.  The bar was moderately crowded and there was a live band playing.  There was an interesting mix of people and our server was very friendly.  The building is one a kind in Tempe and the menus have the story behind it.  The interior is new inside and the outdoor seating is nice as well.  I will be back as this place is fun, clean, reasonably priced, and in a great location.

I went for the happy hour and was very happy with the $2 Margaritas.  I tried the flautas and mini chimi's both were decent but not authentic Mexican.  The chips and salsa were good and the interior is nicely furnished.  I talked to the waitress and she informed me that it is the owner's first sit down restaurant and she is still refining the place and is open to suggestions.  She recommended the weekend music nights, since the musician is a professional.  I am happy there is a good drinking place within walking distance of my home :)

Finally an able competitor to IN & OUT burger! The burgers are a good size and come with all the toppings you would ever want. Their sweet Potato fries are delicious and the portion is soo big that I can usually convince a friend to order them and then steal 1/2 of theirs :)   Despite this place being busy during lunch, they usually have my order ready within 5-10 minutes.   I still like IN & OUT burgers better but this place gives it a run for the money.

This review is for the service department.  I brought my car in for an oil change ($49.95 after coupon!) and asked the tech run my check engine light code.  The service manager refused to run the error code because he said that it would not solve the problem and he recommended I do a full diagnoses at around $85 per hour.  I declined and asked him to humor me and run the error code which he again refused.  The next day I went to Auto Zone and they ran my error code and pointed out that it was caused by my gas cap not being fully tightened.    It is remarkable that the dealership charges $50 for an oil change that you can get elsewhere for $20-30, refuses to do a simple service check, and tries to charge for something that is completely unneeded.  I will never go back to Tempe Scion for service!
