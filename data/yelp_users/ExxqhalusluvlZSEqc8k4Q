Their services are overpriced but reasonably consistent, but I still wouldn't recommend them.  They called us almost every day for months, so finally I picked up the phone to their recorded message saying there was a problem with the bill (which there never was).  So, since I wanted to get this pain in the butt settled, I followed instructions to talk to a customer service rep.  Their idea of customer service is a joke.  This woman claimed that the phone number might still be attached to an old account (we've lived here 2 years!), verified the address, phone number, name on the bill, last 4 of the social and then asked my partner to verify since it's in his name.  I put him on the phone, he verified his name and that he wanted the calls to stop, and it should have been done right then and there.  No such luck,  She kept rambling about how he had to get back on the phone to repeat all of the same info I just gave her.  What a lazy bunch of jackasses.  They have all of the info to go look up the record themselves to verify who the number belongs to, but instead choose to keep harassing us for no reason.  As soon as we move, we are done with them.

Great service, really good choice of lunches and very accommodating for small business groups.  The staff is personable and the location is very convenient.  Overall, a pleasure.  I would recommend this place.

Have had lunch here on several occasions, including business lunches.  The service  is consistently great, the food is organic and reasonably priced, and they even offer gluten free or vegetarian for many of their dishes.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a well prepared, healthy lunch.

Worst company to do business with.  One person tells you one thing and then another tells you something else.  Rude, uncooperative, lack of customer service, a real waste of time.  And don't ever get caught up in a bundle with them.  I gave one star because Yelp wouldn't let me give zero.

We have visited Two Brothers three times so far, and the quality of their food, variety of choices and great service is consistently excellent at very fair prices.  I would strongly recommend this place if you are looking for a great place in the Anthem area for breakfast or lunch.
