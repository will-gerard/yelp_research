I tried this place for the first time today and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and it was fresh and full of wonderful flavors.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the choice of ingredients was unexpected yet delicious!  Kudos to the chef and owners for great quality food at a good price.    HOWEVER....  I take off a star because of the outrageously rude service.  I was dining alone and was not only ignored by my server, but when I asked to pay he did not answer and only glared at me.  He brought the check a moment later with no smile or "How was the food?".  The only contact made by any staff member once my order was taken was by a buser that took my plate away.  Shame on the server for having a severe attitude problem, but double shame on the restaurant for staffing their restaurant with disrespectful employees.

I tried Summit's Yoga with a friend as a way to stretch out after running. I am often tight in the joints from running and massage or yoga really help.  My initial experience was a surprise. Summit was teaching the class that started out by relaxing your body and stilling your mind.  He gave lots of information - explaining that this was everyday yoga, done to help you feel good.  He directed our focus on our own mats and created a feeling of privacy even in that crowded room.  The heat wasn't threatening or uncomfortable, but rather refreshing.  There was a scent of cederwood and mint in the room that I believe comes from spray bottles on hand.  Toward the end of class, I was thrilled by a faster paced flow that felt like a mix of dance with the energy and music of a spin class - that's when I knew I'd be back.  The class is the same every time, allowing you to work at improving in the different poses.   The staff at Summit's Yoga are so friendly and nice.  I decided to cancel my membership at the Village Health Club and make this part of my everyday routine.  I was never that interested in yoga but the mix of the upbeat music, dance feel, friendly staff and refreshing feel of the heat has made a yogi out of me!

Market Bistro gets a four stars from me because the food is delicious and is something unique, that I couldn't easily make at home. The sandwiches are made with fresh meats rather than processed lunch meat and the meats are grilled to order.  The sauces are delicious and the produce and breads are all fresh. The soups are savory and the restaurant is clean. My sons and I can't wait to go back to try the chicken ceaser salad, which looks great!

Breakfast at Autostrada today was disappointing.  I ordered the mushroom omelette, and it was thin and served solo.  Who eats omelettes with NO side dish?  The mushrooms were delicate and delicious and the omelette overall did taste good.  However, this $7 dish was pretty blan with no fruit or toast to have with it.  I did order toast for an additional $1, and was SHOCKED when the bill came and the substitution for egg whites was $3.   This place has NO atmosphere, NO Splenda or Equal for coffee or tea, and little personality.  I'm not sure what the concept behind the place is, and with overpriced food served with no sides - I'll pass.

I love yogurtology!  This is the kind of place North Scottsdale has needed.  I like that it is kept clean; tables are quickly cleaned after each use and the yogurt and topping areas are clean.  Every time I've been there it is sufficiently staffed, and trash cans are emptied when full.  The atmosphere is great with upbeat music.  It is constantly abuzz with customers and is a fun place to spend time.  The product quality is good and the fruit is always fresh, but the attention to maintanence and fun social setting is what keeps our family coming back.
