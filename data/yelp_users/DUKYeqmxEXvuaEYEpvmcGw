I had a turkey sandwich and a fudge sundae.  Mmm mm.  Jerry's is like a good version of Denny's or any of those late night diners.  It was difficult for me to wrap my head around the concept of a 'good' denny's, but their food is actually tastey, their booths are comfortable, it feels like a diner the way it's set up, and they didn't fuck up a sundae.    Oh and I didn't feel sick or gross after eating there AND I saved half my sandwich for later.  Now that's a level of diner food that is deserving of 5 stars!

Everyone knows this place rocks.  It has the best bar food you're likely to come across and some great beers that are so good you can even get them at the local liquor store.  Something others have probably not mentioned -- They have the best tasting water.  My boyfriend was talking about tap water and how gross it is when he turned and said "do you know who has the best water?" I got pretty excited because I did in fact know the answer: Four Peaks.  So did he.  Then we high fived.  I also appreciate the listed % alcohol content.  Sure I used it to order things like the IPA and get fucked up, but now I genuinely like IPA. Thanks Four Peaks!

Nothing I've eaten here has ever been good.  Sure, it only means two meals to review but I'm not a masochist so that's the best you yelpers will get out of me.  I had some lemon grass soup, it tasted as if someone had poured lysol into it.  In fact I stopped after the first spoonful out of concern for my health.  The fact that this place is still open pisses me off.  I blame the trendy vegetarians who don't know how food is supposed to taste because they've accepted it as a casuality of their dietary choice.  Unacceptable!  Cook at home and wise up so that these places can follow their natural progression to extinction.

Thinking back on this place, I was swarmed with how many times and fairly significant experiences I have had here.  Instead of stories I'll just throw some facts at you:  Tut's has the best hummus in all of AZ.  Try it and tell me it's not true.  They give you more pitas than most places and it is pretty darn cheap.  The Phoenician is the only other passable hummus competitor.  The people here are much more friendly and varied than at Oasis.  It reminds me a bit of a drama club room mixed with a Psych 101 class at ASU.  They started playing hip-hop at some point and I don't know if it has stopped yet.  Perhaps only on weekends.  It's off-putting.  I have been told many times that Tut's hookah is not as good as others, but then I've also been told that Red Sea has the best and no one wants to go there.  I don't notice any difference and I doubt most people do.  Get some hummus to go and your day will be brighter.  Particularly if you live in that area because it is kind've a downer.  Maybe sneak it into Plaid so you won't have to eat their god-awful food and can still have a beer.

Their greek salad made me feel bad about every other greek salad I had eaten elsewhere.  It was brilliant.  I'm especially impressed by the fat feta cheese cubes.  It's like buying a huge salad and getting a block of cheese and side of olives for free.

Trader Joe's flowers.  That's enough for 5 stars right there.  The wine is cheap as you could hope for, certain soups in funny shaped cans are worth the drive, and gmo fearing folks can shop in peace...yes, yes, all well and good.  The flowers people, get with it! Their flowers are: 1) cheaper  2) last for practically a week+ 3) prettier  4) varied ...you can get orchids, roses, daisies, lilies, flowers I've never seen before.  Seriously, it is pissing me off that people spend $50 on a bouquet that dies in literally a day when for $5 you can get any number of small bouquets that are infinitely better.  Buy 10 of them and overwhelm your guy/gal with flowers! Buy a potted orchid for $10, chances are they love orchids, because who doesn't?    Buying those over-priced pieces of crap flowers from Fry's or Basha's...come on now, you may as well give a glass rose from Circle K and some meth.

I absolutely love this place.  The bar is actually comfortable to sit at and wait for late arrivals.  I've never had anything but a perfect bartender each time.  All the positive things that others have said about this place are true, the thing that puts it on high in my mind is the exceptional service even when it doesn't go to plan.  My friend's 21st birthday we went to have a late dinner and hopefully sneak in a drink or two for her before midnight.  The staff nixed the early drink idea but gave us a round of shots at midnight.  *It was a small group.  One time we weren't served right away, it was odd because the waitress seemed to be humming all around us...maybe she was new.  The guy I was with got prematurely upset and went to the bar to talk to someone about getting service.  I don't know if it was the infamous Thomas, but whoever the bartender was took our table as his own and we had unbelievable service from then on.  He even comped our first drinks, which I would never expect having been so slightly inconvenienced.  The food is delightful and all that, but oh my god how I love the 2-4-1 drink special.  It makes for the strongest, tastiest, cheapest drinks in town from 4-6:30.  It includes all of their margaritas (the pomegranate is my favorite) any well drink (their g&t is strong and tasty) and most if not all of their beers.  All of the aforementioned usually falls in the category of 2 amazing drinks for $7 which is all it takes for you to be lucidly giddy (an odd feeling that FEZ drinks bring on).   Definitely go here for dinner and the happy hour before a downtown event!

I have nearly been hit by these buses, probably about a half dozen times.  They are assholes.  I've also seen them run red lights at least twice and not the whole "yellow...yellow...red!?! aw crap" kinda running.  The last time I rode the bus someone must have shit their pants.  I blame the old guy across from me.  It was amusing to watch everyone get off at the next stop, but extremely inconvenient to walk the extra distance to class.  I haven't been on since.    *ASU has free bus passes for all students, which is the only thing that makes it worth riding.  Go to the bottom floor of the towers where you buy parking passes and get yourself a semester pass.

The light rail has become a big part of my life.  I moved into a place specifically for it's proximity to the Thomas/Central station.  I go to ASU and have ridden it every day this week, here's why:  1. It's free, because I'm an ASU student 2. It makes the walk at 6:30am in the dark seem kinda cool 3. I enjoy sitting and not driving 4. I finished a book with just my metro reading time 5. I get some much needed "me" time 6. I never have to deal with ASU's parking EVER AGAIN  Thanks light rail for keeping me sane and helping save me money until my goddamn FAFSA check comes in the mail.  I'm taking off a star because you don't run late enough to take back from work.  I know you're thinking "jesus, it sounds like this girl's life sucks hard core".  Yeah, it really does.
