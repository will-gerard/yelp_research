A group of friends and I visited Coup Des Tartes for the first time on Friday night, and we had a fantastic time -- echoing many of the reviews before me.  The BYOB ($8 corking fee but they were sweetly not paying attention to how many bottles we opened) situation just makes me happy and always ensures a happy table.  The menu is small but it was all right up my alley and I had a hard time deciding which app/salad/entree/dessert -- strong options in all categories.  Our table got the brie brulee appetizer, which wasn't anything complicated but yummy nonetheless.  We shared some salads (a split brie and pear salad for me...sense a trend?) and then I ordered the sea bass for an entree.  It was absolutely delicious!  Toss in the chocolate lover's dessert and I was in love.  Our service was impeccable and the energy from the staff was perfect for our Friday night.  The place is very small and I loved that; felt more like a restaurant in NYC vs. Phoenix.  Reservations are a requirement from what I understand, which makes sense with the small # of tables.  Entrees are in the $25-$35 range, but are very well-prepared and have good portions.  Food is pricey but at the end of the day my group was out of there at $55/person with tip included -- not bad at all (especially with one of the dishes being the lobster)!

Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance.   The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry.

This place is pretty good.  I mean, getting my car washed isn't exactly a chore I look forward to completing... I usually view it as a "time suck" in the middle of an errand-filled Saturday.    What I like about this Cobblestone location is that you can really multi-task!  The inside is loaded with extras, including a Dunkin Donuts outlet (the rest of my errands are more productive after I get a coffee boost).  There's also ample indoor seating with CNN and sports, and a huge kids' play area a la McDonalds -- which I imagine is very convenient if you have family in-tow.    The quality of the car washes is average, but this is my car wash of choice when it comes to spending time waiting.  TIP:  do not use cash for the exterior-only fast pass lane unless you have exact bills!  If you insert a $20, the machine will give you a receipt and force you to go inside the store to get your change -- which completely defeats the purpose of "fast pass."

I am definitely not an expert in Vietnamese food, just to put that out there.  That said, I really enjoy Tea Lite Cafe.  My co-workers and I go here regularly, and it is a staple in the portfolio.    I get the #1 and honestly don't remember its name, only the deliciousness of the rice noodles and beef.  The beef has amazing flavor and I wish there was about twice as much included in the dish (not just because it tastes good, but also because I could use a little bit more protein to get me through the afternoon).  We often get an order of the shrimp spring rolls to help supplement the lunches here.  The service is very fast.  Important tip for weekday lunches:  get there early!  This place fills up quickly and does not have many tables.

The most intense experience of my life:  serving as Coach #1b for my best friend as she went through labor this week.  The three of us (1st-time mom, husband and me) bonded like NO OTHER experience could ever bond us as we got through all sorts of crazy and war-like things that happened through 30 hours of labor ending in a C section.  That said:  this hospital is incredible.  Those labor and delivery nurses must be born with a special kind of saint/angel/superhero genetic makeup.  Without their help, hubby and I would not have been able to get her through that process.  The knowledge, care and humanity of each individual working there was unbelievable.  They saw us at our worst:  scared, overwhelmed, completely clueless, and in an out-of-control situation.  Their ability to manage that kind of chaos and intensity simply blows my mind.   I tried to thank the staff with tears and hugs at the end of the process, but there's truly no way I can ever express my gratitude.

Where has Ristorante Giuseppe been all my life??  Family-owned atmosphere, great food, and BYOB with no corking fee?  Sold!  I checked out this place for a date night last Friday, and was really quite tickled with the entire experience.  I had been to Arrivederci, an Italian restaurant in the same complex, for lunch several times before and never even noticed this small place just a few doors down.    While the atmosphere isn't cool, trendy or romantic, it feels warm, inviting and down-to-earth.  There was definitely an energy in the place that let you know you were among friends-of-Giuseppe's, and I liked that; it felt like we were discovering a well-loved secret.  We split the Giuseppe Salad to start, which was a pretty standard (eh) Italian-style salad that served two.  After some bread/garlic butter, we also split a pasta dish (rigatoni + tomato cream sauce + spinach and chicken) and the homemade tiramisu for dessert (was the best tiramisu I have ever had, and though it was smaller than most portions I have seen, it hit the spot).  I think our entire bill was ~$32, and I thought it was a great value.  Also, heads up -- CASH ONLY, no cards!  I liked the huge variety on the menu, but didn't realize all the mix-and-match possibilities until our server talked us through it -- so if it's your first time going, I would definitely let them know and ask them to take you through the menu.    I will definitely be going back to this spot to try to worm my way into Giuseppe's extended family  :-)

Four Peaks has my heart.  I frequented the Tempe location regularly on Thursday nights when I was at ASU, and I literally got tears in my eyes when I moved north after graduation and discovered the North Scottsdale location.  When I walk in the door, I feel like I'm in Billings, Montana...and I love it!  Down to earth, authentic and quality.  For detailed info, check out the 35+ Tempe location reviews.  I will say that Four Peaks' Peach Ale made me fall in love with beer, and that their food is just phenomenal, far superior than what you would expect from a typical brewery.  The specials consistently impress me, but when in doubt, my default choice is the chicken beer bread (like a hot flatbread wrap with artichokes, green pepper, onion mozzarella) with either the beer bread fries (so freaking yummy) or side salad (honestly can't go wrong, I just crave their salads sometimes).  I think I've tried almost every appetizer and they are all delicious and huge, you can easily order several for a group and call it dinner.  The spinach artichoke dip is a big crowd pleaser.

Is it bad that I have an active membership to this gym and I am only giving it 2 stars?  I guess it's fine, but compared to where I was working out before (oh Mountainside at Bell and the 101, I miss you so...) it is night and day.  The location is so convenient though that it doesn't make sense to join anywhere else.  The ellipticals work.  Other than that, pretty blah -- fuzzy TVs that are always turned to Fox News, the feel of a big cement converted warehouse, staffers that seem zoned out all the time.    I enjoy the people watching and the other gym-goers seem to be "normal" people and friendly, so that's worth some points...almost enough for that third star.  Almost.

I had SUCH a great experience using Galloping Groomer for my cat! I highly recommend them to anyone.   My cat is indoors-only, and I have never bathed him myself. I called Galloping Groomer because he hates the car and I liked the idea of minimizing his stress time by taking the car ride out of the equation by having someone pull up to my place. I took advantage of their convenient 7am appointment so that I could handle the grooming before work.   Making the appointment was easy, and my groomer, Kristi, was right on time. She came in and built rapport with my cat and was very patient as he clawed her shoulder, drawing blood, as she carried him out to the van! She was also patient with me: she allowed me to stay with my cat throughout the process, and helped calm me down by explaining everything step by step and assuring me that even though my cat was basically screaming, that he was okay (apparently she stops immediately if they start heavy panting or have an accident).   I was very impressed with the office's follow-up call several days later to ask me how my experience was -- very good customer service.   Overall I am glad that my cat and I got through it. Kristi was great with him and I can see why people call her the cat whisperer. My cat was still pretty traumatized by the entire experience so I won't be doing it super regularly, but he felt "so fresh and so clean clean" afterwards so I know it is worth doing at least every 1-2 years. Maybe with my learnings from Kristi's technique, I'll even be brave enough to try on my own sometime?

I have been going to Michael for at least a year now, and am a pretty satisfied customer.    1) great location at the corner of Indian School and Scottsdale Rd. 2) totally chill vibe for the primo location!  Michael owns the salon and keeps the feel very grounded -- not pretentious or snooty at ALL. 3) great value:  very reasonable prices for cut and color 4) flexible scheduling.  The one heads up I must give is that Michael will DEFINITELY want to talk with you while you're there, so don't plan on any spaced out zen time.  If you're reading a magazine, he'll be right over your shoulder asking what you are reading about.  On the plus side, he is super intelligent and outspoken so it's fun to talk about politics or local issues with him -- he's very well rounded and has had a super interesting life.

Sunday Brunch.  11:00.  Arrived, "walked the [plywood] plank" through the construction outside of the parking lost.  There was a 20-minute wait for a table but we lucked out and took the last 2 seats at the bar.    I smiled when I ordered a bloody mary and the bartender informed me that my bloody mary came with a free 3oz shooter of the beer of my choice (had to go with my girl, Stella).  $6.50 for a cocktail and an "appetizer" drink?  Quite the steal.   The food was fantastic--I followed the Yelp advice and got the green chile enchiladas + eggs (next time I will get both enchiladas with the shrimp, and order the eggs over easy instead of scrambled).  The friend I was with ordered the breakfast burrito.  Both of our dishes were VERY tasty and HUGE -- I ate about half and made another meal out of it later in the day.  I think all the brunch dishes were $9-$14, but with the huge portions and cheap drinks, it was a steal.  By the time we left there was a long wait just to get a seat at the bar, much less a table so we definitely beat the rush.  I will make a point to get back here for dinner ASAP!

I love AZ88  There, I said it.  While I will admit that I was first introduced to AZ88 by my "Will," it is a very mixed crowd and depending on when you go, is certainly no more of a scene than anywhere else in Scottsdale.  Weekday lunches are quiet with business associates or old money who lunch.  Early evenings often attract senior citizen couples on their way to the theater.  And then, of course, there's late-night on the weekend...in which case bring your sunglasses at night.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is consistently cool and stunning--walking in just brings a smile to my face.  The rotating decor always makes me look forward to seeing what facelift will have emerged the next time I go.    My all-time favorite drink is served here--I don't think it's on the menu, so be sure to remember SUMMER SOLSTICE MARTINI.  This is one freaking stiff drink, but the alcohol will sneak-attack you like a ninja so don't be suprised at how goofy you find yourself after just 2.  Toss in the AZ88 Club (I like mine with chicken/avocado, on wheat with no middle bread) or China Lil Chicken sandwich and I'm a happy camper.  AZ88 is a fun spot with a lot of energy--I have organized large groups there for multiple birthdays and celebrations.  They don't take reservations so if you're trying to get a large table on a weekend night, be prepared to get a drink at the bar or slump onto a couch on the patio for awhile.    Maybe it's just all my great memories there, but for me, AZ88 = love.

*Please note, I'm writing in review of the happy hour only.  I recently discovered this happy hour gem with some girl friends, and it has quickly become a favorite in the portfolio (instead of ladies who lunch, I guess we're ladies who drink).  The patio is fantastic and while I often get in ruts with beer and wine, Bloom's martini menu is enough to get anyone back onto the hard stuff!  My favorite is the Elderflower Drop, a vodka-based drink with St. Germain that I can't seem to re-create on my own, no matter how hard I try.  Their drinks do have that hand-crafted-mixologist vibe, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  For $4-5/drink, these premium cocktails are a great deal!  Additionally, the HH food menu would make any foodie happy and has a really nice variety of small plates.  I'd confidently recommend the tuna, smoked salmon or artichoke hearts -- though I've tried most of the apps on the menu and have never been disappointed.  If you like truffle oil, you're in luck at this place as it seems to be laced into dishes at every other turn!  The only things preventing me from giving this 5 stars are the HH time (HH ends at six, which is hard to make if you have a job like mine) and the service, which has been okay-to-mediocre during most of my visits.  I'd like to think it's because they just happen to be really busy, and not that they are actually forgetting to check on our table  ;-)  Overall, an unexpectedly great happy hour spot.

*Please note, I am writing to review the Deseo Lounge only, not the adjoining restauraunt.  This is my favorite happy hour hideaway, and I'm reviewing it to pay it forward even though I am terrified that word will leak out to the local crowd about this fantastic resort secret.  Deseo is hidden in the basement of the Kierland Westin.  The cozy, dark and cool atmosphere with subtle candles and leather-padded walls makes me feel like I'm on a mysterious rendezvous every time I walk into the lounge.    Their "unwind hour" is featured from 5:30-7:30 (please note that the bar doesn't open until 5:30) and features great prices on the best mojitos I have ever tasted (you can't go wrong with the classic Grande, but the berry-based version is pretty tasty as well).  Just a warning, the mojitos are STRONG and pack a punch for their very reasonable $5-$7 HH prices!    Deseo is famous for their ceviche, and I highly recommend the Ecuadorian and Rainbow ceviches.  The other must-order items are the kobe meatballs (we all felt a little embarrassed at first over our love for the meatballs, but once you've had them, you'll order with pride) and the rolls, which are served hot and infused with trace amounts of some sort of cheese... I'm not sure what the magic ingredient is, but they just melt in your mouth.  The service is usually solid, with a very knowledgeable and experienced staff, but if they get a rush then expect to be patient while they make due with the hands they have.  The lounge is very small and intimate so it's not uncommon to grab a table just outside of the lounge walls if they are having a busy night.

Rumbi is probably the most-frequented place in our workday lunch rotation.  I describe it to people as a poor-gal's Tommy Bahama.  The decor is island-ish (squint your eyes really hard and pretend you're on vacation) and the staff is friendly enough to make-believe that you're a guest at a tropical resort.  Okay, maybe that last part is a bit of an overpromise, but a girl can dream...  The hulu salad is really tasty and almost a little too large(I highly recommend asking them to do a spinach/romaine combo), but lately I have been jonesing for the luau pork plate with rumbi rice (pulled pork, coconut rice with red beans, some mac salad and a bit of coleslaw--so yummy, I crave it).  The food is pretty reasonably-priced for what you get, and it's the "fast casual" style where you walk up and order and then they bring it out to you.    When you get sick of wraps or sandwiches in the Promenade-area, give Rumbi a try to mix it up.  I think it would be hard to be disappointed.  Aloha!

I stopped by Wicked on a Saturday afternoon to pick up an assortment of goodies for a brunch get-together.  Slade, the owner, immediately greeted me at the door and started taking me through my options.  (helpful tip from Slade, the options get more and more limited during the day, so if you want the most variety, stop by early)  I was hesitant about Slade's pecan bread pudding recommendation, so he promptly heated up a slice for me--the first bite convinced me on the spot, and it was a HUGE hit at my brunch!  I am going to make that bread pudding my signature hostess gift!  The cupcakes, scones and turnovers that I brought were all really big hits with my brunch crowd.   I spent at least 20 minutes in the bakery and could have stayed longer just talking with Slade about his passion for baking and watching him and his team interact with their customers.  Wicked is another one of those stripmall gems and a secret that I am happy to say that I'm in on.

I am torn between 1.5 and 2 stars.  The 2 stars are mostly in credit of the potential--fantastic menu, decent wine selection, could be good atmosphere.  My experience, however, left a lot to be desired.    It was my first time there and I was impressed with the large selection on the menu and the discovery of one of my favorite wines (Red Guitar) available by the glass.  The Monday evening was downhill from that first glance at the menu.  I sat for at least 10 minutes before I caught the eye of the manager, who then sent my server over to give me water and take my drink order.  The service continued to be very lackluster throughout the night.  The restaurant was very slow on this weeknight, yet we could never find our server.  She seemed to be absent even when she was standing at our table.  Several requests (an item that came out wrong and needed to be corrected, asking for extra pitas) took a shockingly long time to fulfill.  The sundried tomato hummus appetizer just didn't taste right, and the stuffed pepper dish that we got was not at all what I anticipated -- too rich and sweet for my taste.    I was very disappointed with the evening, and won't be able to justify going there again.

I freaking love Trader's.  I do the majority of my grocery shopping here and I think it says something that I usually leave feeling accomplished and excited to get home and dig into my bags!    This location did some remodeling last year to try to make more room, but it can still be pretty crowded at times.  To be honest, I don't mind (just ditch the cart and stick with the basket strategy) as I enjoy being a total stalker and secretly checking out what other people are putting into their carts -- Trader's has tons of cool and interesting stuff so it's always fun to try something new (I highly recommend checking out their sample/demo booth to get new ideas).    Favorite Traders-only staples (all Trader Joe private label brand) that keep me coming back: * Habenero-Lime Salsa (super spicy, but cut it with sour cream--YUM) * Soy-Flax Seed Tortilla Chips * Olive Tapenade * Verde Enchiladas (frozen) * Organic Ketchup (I bet you thought all ketchup was equal, but this stuff is amazing!!) * Roasted Tomato & Red Pepper Soup (this has been out of stock lately, but if you see it, grab 3!)

Please note that I am writing specifically to review my experiences with Boyd, one of the nail technicians at Carolyne's.  I think the salon itself is adequate -- stylish but not overly-pretentious decor, a super convenient location, and a very indulgent and current selection of guilty pleasure US Weekly, OK and Vanity Fair magazines.  It's obviously very girlie-oriented and I always feel like I am treating myself when I'm there.  Boyd, however, is way more than adequate!  He is one of the only people who I will trust with my fingernails -- best manicures I have ever had!  I have natural nails and I am so protective of letting "just anyone" have their way with my delicate nail beds.  Boyd is a pro and is just as OCD about nails and polish as I am.  The polish selection at Carolyne's has got to be best-in-class:  all the technicians share, and I swear you can name an OPI seasonal shade from 4 years ago and someone will know exactly what you're talking about and locate it for you!  To boot, I genuinely enjoy spending time with Boyd -- just fun and a pleasure.  Sometimes I will also pop in for a pampering pedicure, and I highly suggest the new chocolate-scented scrub/mask/lotion products.  Mmmmm....  The next time you feel like you deserve an upgrade from one of those walk-in places, consider paying a bit more and making an appointment with my boy Boyd!

I have to confess that I have not been able to make it to Sol y Sombra for dinner, but I am here to rave about their Sunday brunch service--of which I have become an addict.  Brunch starts at 10:30, which is just about right for my girl friends and me.  I highly recommend patio seating if the weather allows.  Mimosas are tasty and the coffee is also a nice way to welcome the day.  The brunch is served tapas style, per the rest of the meals served at the restaurant.  A good rule of thumb seems to be one small plate per person plus 1-2 extra to share.  The food comes out quickly so you can always order more.  After many visits, we have determined our favorites to be 1) patatas bravas (like socially-acceptable chunky french fries with a great flavor kick), 2) almond french toast (they serve it with syrup AND chocolate sauce, come on), 3) tortilla espinaca (this really interesting quiche-type dish with a bacon-infused sauce...really nice), 4) skirt steak with romesco sauce (gotta fit the protein in there somewhere).  This is a great place to waste away a Sunday morning--aside from the mouth-watering food, you'll find a lovely atmosphere, great music, and calm goodness.

I discovered this magazine at Borders this year and become an instant-fan.  This is the most relevant, clever and interesting local publication that I have ever stumbled across (I wonder if I could ever convince them to take over the 10:00 news...).  Reading this magazine makes me feel like I live in a real city.    Right now most of their distribution seems to be through Borders book stores, but I just signed up for a subscription (a new offering from them) and will definitely be including this magazine in my holiday gift shopping.  http://www.phxmetropolitan.com

Sushi Brokers is a staple in my portfolio.  They have a great happy hour with discounts on select sushi and beverages, and it can accommodate many different sizes of groups.  This fallback place is great for unwinding with co-workers, meeting up with friends or even getting a bite to eat on a Friday night date.  The "oh I love this song!" music alone can help to perk me up and start out a night the right way!  The sushi is very good -- may not be the best I have ever had but it definitely hits the spot and the fun, lowkey-but-energetic atmosphere is what keeps me coming back over and over.  One caution, the martinis tend to be a bit heavy on the juice and light on the vodka, so go with beer/wine if you're like me and can't handle the fruity drinks.

This might be the best-kept secret on Yelp.  I found out about this fruit and veggie co-op through a couple of friends, and was thrilled to see such a variety of pickup locations across the valley -- including one at a park less than 2 miles from my house!  I took a silly amount of pleasure in gathering my reusable grocery bags and getting up at 7am this morning to pickup my produce.  I echo the other reviewers that the quality is fantastic and the pickup process is quick and very painless.  Their web site is a little difficult to navigate, but sure enough -- I entered my credit card info and pickup location on Wednesday, and Saturday morning they had my name and confirmation number on the list  so their system certainly works!  The surprising variety is simply FUN!  I made impromptu grilled veggie kabobs and fruit salad for lunch today to start digging into my supply, and the inclusion of a spaghetti squash in my basket led me to discover a 5-star recipe on allrecipes.com that I can't wait to try out this week.    I definitely plan to recommend this fun and super valuable co-op to friends.

Wow, there are many in-depth reviews on here so I won't go into detail -- just wanted to give a shout out after my awesome experience here last night.  I think I may have a new favorite restaurant!  We came for the Yelp Restaurant Week menu, but ended up spending quite a bit of time in the bar area before our reservation.  Two rounds of Shochu (HIGHLY recommend the nectarine, so light and clean) and 3 apps later (the butterfish tataki changed my life), we made our way to dinner.  I have to admit that the apps shined above our entrees (salmon terriyaki), but because we had a limited entree menu with the scorching Yelp deal I am not going to fault Roka Akor for that.  All-in-all, just a great experience.  I loved the cool and contemporary atmosphere with all the energy and light -- the vibe is just fantastic.  I will definitely be returning and will put this in the portfolio as a great place for either business dinners or drink/app dates.  Instant fan.

After a VERY scary tire blowouton the 51 North, I had a friend do some mapquesting and determine that this Discount Tire location was within the 5 miles that my AAA would pay to be towed.  While I chose them based on an emergency situation + convenient location, I am now a lifetime customer!  Jim greeted me upon my arrival and walked with me out to examine my car.  He patiently explained what had happened with my tire to cause it to explode (stupid nail and rubber rubbing against itself situation).  When he learned that I had purchased my previous tires from Costco, he became determined to convert me into a customer.  To win me over, he pro-rated the warranty on my tire as if I had bought it from Discount with the warranty coverage!  Therefore it only cost me $50 to replace the tire -- which I know for a fact is better than the coverage that Costco would have given me!  I was so moved that I promptly agreed to purchase the Discount warranty (which covers simply everything except for wearout) for my other 3 tires.  Bonus:  I walked next door to Arribas and enjoyed a relaxing cocktail at the bar during the 45 minutes it took them to replace my tire.  Not a bad way to kill some time.

When my brother's friend found out where I lived recently, his first reaction was "oh, so you've been to Kampai then?"  My blank look horrified him, and he quickly explained that apparently I have a hidden gem sushi place in my North Phoenix neighborhood -- a "gem" that he referred to as one of the best in the city!  This was a pleasant surprise to me (I guess I should have paid more attention when I drove by that bowling lane strip mall...).  Two words:  GREAT SUSHI!  Seriously up-to-par with my most recent bar-setter, Hana sushi -- except less expensive and much larger portions.  In fact, I had the opposite experience of many of the reviewers here:  our portions were shockingly large, from oversized/fat rolls to a sashimi order that was almost double what I would have expected.  The albacore tataki and Kampai roll were our favorites, but everything we had was fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere leaves something to be desired, depending on your mood.  I was a little caught off-guard by the harsh...errr...bright lighting as well as the lack of noise/energy there on a Friday night.  Of course this can be refreshing compared to the "scene" at a Stingray or Ra.  Our service at our table was fantastic, very attentive and friendly.    I will definitely be making Kampai a staple in the portfolio, and given that I favored the food over the dining experience, I will certainly consider takeout as well in the future.

I [HEART] SUPERTARGET!    Seriously, this Target is wonderful.  It just opened in December 2007 and is enough incentive for me to actually drive west of my townhouse (very rare).    It is huge and gorgeous, everything is clean and very new.  The produce and packaged goods selection is awesome--I actually find that going here can give me my Trader Joe's fix, because they have so many niche items and unique ready-to-prepare meals.  From clothes to frozen foods to blenders to sushi, this place has it all.  They make the entire experience so enjoyable that I can get lost here for ridiculous amounts of time.  I even had a first date last spring that involved doing a SuperTarget tour (he knew the way to my heart ,obviously--a Friday night in red patent heels and a Target basket in-tow...sigh).  For casual errands or major weekend nesting stock-ups, I highly recommend this Tar-get.

Total Wine is just FUN!  If you enjoy your wine...or beer...or liquor, it's like being a kid in a candy store (a kid over the age of 21 of course).    They have the widest selection of wine of ANY store I have ever visited, and easily more than BevMo.  It's like the Willy Wonka Factory of wine stores.  To boot, their prices are awesome!  For example, a Cline Cashmere blend that I previously could only find locally at Cost Plus World Market was a full $4.00 cheaper at Total Wine vs. at Cost Plus.    I can spend some serious time walking the aisles of Total Wine.  They feature write-ups and the points of many wines, and also note "employee favorites" in each section.  I am thrilled that I can now get great prices locally on bottles that I have previously only been able to buy in-person during visits to wine country.  Also, their hard alcohol selection and pricing is simply fantastic -- and I love their large selection of "airplane size" bottles!  So fun and cute, in every alcohol variety you can imagine.    Oh and did I mention that they have free daily tastings?  One time there was even a tequila tasting in addition to the wines they were sampling.  The only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars is that I had to do a return there today because my purchase from last night rang up incorrectly.  When I informed them today that the only tag on the self was a different (less expensive) variety of the champagne that was adjacent to it, they became very defensive and argued with me about the possibility of that happening!  I easily let it go (although I know I was right!) and chalked it up to these people just really taking wine and their store seriously.  And there's nothing wrong with that!

My 4 stars for Hanny's are driven almost completely by the atmosphere of this converted department store. A friend and I met up for drinks there last Friday, and lingered for around 5 hours (another friend was flying in from NYC and his flight was delayed several times, so the rounds kept coming).   Several people have commented negatively on the service, lighting or music, but they must be working out the kinks with all of the above because they were spot-on during our visit. The DJ was spinning a combination of subtle vibe-enducing music mixed with "oh, I LOVE this song" uncovered and unexpected old favorites. The lighting gradually shifting during the evening, so that by midnight it was a cozy and romantic mood.   Speaking of, let me just say it: something about this place just felt...sexy. I don't know if it was the music, the lighting, the "baby it's cold outside" week before Christmas, or my malbec-shiraz. The things-could-happen-here feel especially hit me when I went upstairs and saw the unisex restrooms all lined up; white unmarked doors all in a row to their own little rooms -- it was straight out of a Madonna video circa 1995!   Biggest watchout: the martini glasses were offensively and ridiculously tiny. I mean, really?!? I had read about this in reviews before going, but I was so shocked at the size that I refused to order one and stuck with wine (which I wouldn't say was a "healthy" pour, but at least took me more than 4 sips to finish). The menu is also relatively limited. We shared the bar plate and a prosciutto pizza (added mushrooms) and enjoyed both, but neither were outstanding or very filling.   All-in-all, I will definitely recommend this place to friends for drinks or drinks/apps. It's a unique space with a great vibe and I am sure it will do well once word gets out.

I won't be going back to Posh.    Based on some of the recent reviews here (August-September 2011), I'm almost wondering if the restaurant has switched management or something?  I went there tonight with a friend for dinner, and had a mediocre-at-best experience -- and that's not taking into consideration the injury at the end of the meal!    While some people seem to have amazing foodie experiences here, we definitely did not have the same luck.  We ordered the 5-course menu and said we were up for anything.  Everything was....eh.  Throughout the night we had some interesting dishes:  kangaroo, sweetbreads (organ meat), snail, mussels, sashimi, duck, etc.  However the flavors were just okay:  most were relatively bland, and a couple of the sauces/dressings were even borderline unpleasant for me.  In general the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great and ditto for the service.  For what Posh charges, both should be exceptional.  The presentation is absolutely beautiful, and the ingredients are unique, but my conclusion is that this restaurant is more razzle dazzle than substance.  Because the quality of the dishes didn't live up to the hype or price, I felt like this was simply a novelty restaurant, hiding behind a gimmick rather than great food.  Note:  my review above is a fair conclusion based on the meal before dessert, and was not influenced by the story I'm about to share...  TIP/DANGER WATCHOUT:  we literally had an injury (seriously, involving bleeding from the mouth!) at our table at the end of the night!  Our server brought out the final cleanser, a popsicle-type sweet dessert.  It was frozen pretty hard, and as my friend went to taste it, it stuck to a large piece of her lip!!  It was horrific to watch as she tried to pull away but was stuck, just like the kid in the Christmas Story movie!  She finally got it off but was bleeding from where the popsicle stuck.  We immediately dropped the weapons/desserts and alerted our server, who laughed, briefly apologized and said they'd probably been "sitting out too long" and offered to make fresh ones but didn't offer anything else.  We talked with the manager (we also wanted to make sure, for safety reasons, that they properly disposed of my friend's bloody napkin) and he was horrified that the server didn't take care of us and he appropriately adjusted our bill and apologized about the incident as well as for our server not properly handling the situation.  We felt the manager made it right at the end of the meal, but it was a pretty sour way to conclude the evening.  Tip from me to you:  be careful with anything frozen here, and consider letting it thaw a bit before you taste.

I have quickly become a huge fan of this place!!  I joined this training-only gym to complement my 24-Hour Fitness membership.  When I'm in the gym on my own, I can zone out with the elliptical for extended lengths of time but am pretty clueless when it comes to weight training.  Fuzion has worked very nicely into my fitness routine.  You can try it for FREE (which is what hooked me initially), and I even did 2 free sessions so that I could try different trainers and make sure I found a fit.  I knew I had a match as soon as I worked out with Andrew, who has great energy, challenges and motivates me, and is actually enjoyable to talk with (a little different vs. some past experiences I have had working with trainers).  If you decide to do a free introductory session and are interested in signing up, make sure that your trainer's schedule fits with your own -- some of the trainers that the owner and I discussed were unavailable most nights/weekends, which is the only time I am free.  Fuzion offers a "use it or lose it" plan that is pretty unique, signing up for X amount of sessions a month at a discount rate vs. just buying a [pricier] pre-paid package.  Brian, the owner, is very commited to ensuring a great experience so I highly recommend reaching out (he's ridiculously responsive on e-mail) and seeing if Fuzion is a fit for your needs!

Met up here with a large group for HH earlier tonight.  It was my first visit to this new location, and it was pretty busy for a Thursday.  While I might try it again just due to the location, the service was so horrible that it will be a long time before I consider organizing another large group function there.    I arrived after my group's first round had been served, and I think it was almost 30 minutes before I could get a drink!  Furthermore, one of the guys in our group finally went up to the bar to get a round of drinks since so many of us had been waiting so long, and he was turned around and told to go sit and wait for the server.  Not cool after a long day at the office!  That combined with turning off the misters a bit too early on a hot evening = a one drink and bad first impression HH for me.

I went to 25 Degrees on Friday (not to be confused with 18 Degrees, which I tried on Sunday) for a business lunch.  None of us had gone there but there's some good buzz going around our office about this new City North restaurant, so we decided to give it a try.  The atmosphere is cool, definitely unique and I could see it feeling a bit sexy/swank at night.  Their burger selection was fantastic, similar to Blu Burget (RIP) or other specialty burger joints with a ton of toppings that you can use to play and customize.  I tried their pre-built recommendation with burrata and prosciutto -- it was really yummy!  My boss and I both ordered medium rare, but they came out definitively RARE (if not raw), but we were so hungry that we dove in anyway.  The onion rings we got beforehand were superb, and I highly recommend the thousand island dipping sauce (not your mom's thousand island).  Overall I will definitely stop by this place again, but next time I will plan on splitting a burger with someone and then walking down to Mojo Yogurt for dessert afterward  :-)

Sometimes you are lucky enough to have one of those dining experiences that is simply charmed -- where everything is in zone.  The food, the atmosphere, the drinks and company just comes together in sync.  I was lucky enough to find myself enjoying one of those charmed events earlier today at Beuregard Food Company.    This restaurant just opened in late January 2010, and I could not be more excited for this new find.  My group stopped in when we heard that Beauregard was doing a special crawfish & shrimp boil (all you can eat for $15).  Two in our party went with the crawfish, while I ordered the short rib special and another friend went the salad and hummus appetizer route.  Abita beer and wine flowed...  If you've spent any time in New Orleans, you will understand what I say when I explain that Beauregard embodies the NOLA spirit.  Of course part of that spirit does involve indulging in food and drink -- and our group partnered with Beauregard on that one!    Of note:      1) My new obsession has now officially become the fried pickles appetizer, which quite simply rocked my world.  Where have fried pickles been all my life??  I can tell you right now that this is going to be an issue...I am going to be craving these things on a too-regular basis!      2) The crawfish/shrimp boil was not only tasty but also a magazine-photo-shoot-worthy presentation, complete with potatoes, andouille sausage, corn on the cob and onions.  I couldn't believe the quality and quantity of food -- truly a feast!  It sounds like they're going to try to do these boils on a ~monthly basis ongoing, so here's hoping!      3) The rest of our apps and entrees were solid, with nice flavors, large portions and a great value for what you get.      4) Dessert.  Now I am not really a sweet-tooth person, but get this:  Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding.  Dan, the owner of Beauregard, also essentially owns Krispy Kreme in AZ (including the store next door).  This dessert was devoured by our table in about 90 seconds -- after the first bite, all manners went out the window!  Genius, pure genius..  Again, the best and most intangible part of our experience may have been the true NOLA vibe here -- relaxed with good people enjoying life.  We got to spend some time getting to know Dan, and I truly felt like I was a guest in his home.  His passion for food and true southern hospitality is so apparent, and so reflected in Beauregard, that I think it would be impossible to not fall in love.

YAY!!!!!!!!!!!  After months of anticipation, the new Vig location (closer to me vs. what is now affectionately referred to as "The Vintage Vig") is open and did not disappoint!  Whew!  The parking seems to still have some kinks to work out, as any signs of a valet stand or staff were MIA when I initially pulled up (7pm on a Sunday).  We figured it out though and no big deal.    The atmosphere here is just awesome, I absolutely love it.  It seems more spacious than the original space, but it was also slow while I was in there so I am hesitant to make a firm judgement until after it passes the Friday-happy-hour-test.  Same great vibe though, perhaps even warmer/sexier atmosphere.  The biggest surprise to me was the faux patio, with large open windows but actually an enclosed space.  For me, one of the fatal flaws of the original Vig patio the limited outdoor seats that also weren't smoking tables, so perhaps this is a good solve?  Overall, will absolutely put this spot in heavy rotation.  Keep the new locations coming, please!!

Megan and Gabi, the first two reviewers, really said it all.  I will just add another layer of approval to enhance the credibility of everything they said--Herb Box is AMAZING.  In fact, I consciously make efforts at work to not expose too many people to it, because I don't want the entire company discovering my secret lunch place!  Also, it's important to note that this restaurant's title in Yelp is confusing -- they started as a catering company and the food was so amazing that they opened a little takeout marketplace.  The marketplace got so popular that they bought the space next door and opened a little bistro as well--with which I have lot's of experience!  Yes, the sweet potato chips are to die for (and are often the tipping point decision between ordering a wrap or a salad).  My favorite menu item is the turkey/apple/swiss wrap (has cashews and lot's of mixed greens in it, really yum) but highly encourage trying their specials, which are always fantastic.    They offer iced green tea that is really tasty, and have a small beer/wine/drink menu as well.  The DC Ranch location is confirmed, which is awesome--I could definitely see this place expanding throughout the valley:  the fresh, healthy food they offer combined with the charming atmosphere often makes a visit to this bistro the highlight of my day.

I was very excited to discover this new coffee shop last Saturday!  A friend had suggested meeting there, and I mistakenly assumed it would be nested into the strip mall (in typical Phoenix fashion).  Instead, I was surprised to find this stand-alone structure in the parking lot of the NW corner of 32nd St. and Shea.    You can tell just by pulling up that this place is cool:  contemporary and fun signage, an intimate little patio, and bowls of water set out for dogs to enjoy.  Further indoor signals of this place's cool factor and unique character:  coffee drinks with Nutella (file that under "why didn't I think of that??"), a fantastic music playlist that reminded me of the Garden State soundtrack, day-old scones discounted to 50-cents each (love how unpretentious that felt), and boxes of matzoh displayed on top of the espresso machine (when I inquired about what they use the matzoh with, she explained that it was Passover so she thought her Jewish customers might enjoy the matzoh options for sandwiches -- so fun and sweet!).  My iced coffee was fantastic, and I definitely intend to come back and explore their "Wichcraft," AKA, Sandwich, menu.  The description of the OMG sandwich will be enough to get me to come back -- fig, marscapone and prosciutto!  Overall, this independent little shop has potential written all over it, and I can't wait to increase my cool factor by adding it into my portfolio.  Watch out, Luci's Marketplace -- you have some new competition!

In one word:  fun.  This place is definitely worth checking out if you are into your nails like me.  The concept reminds me a LOT of DryBar (girlie focus, fun feel/atmosphere, fast service), but instead of blowouts they do polish.    I was so excited about my completed manicure that I texted photos to friends and also posted it on my Facebook!  My technician was able to re-create a nail style with glitter that I had pinned on Pinterest 7 months ago, and after lusting after the look this entire time, I finally was able to wear it.  The "claim to fame" of Teres is that they can pretty much do any style/trend that you see on Pinterest, and as I texted my friend, "this place is glitter HQ!"  If you like glitter, welcome to your heaven.  They have a fun Look Book on their iPad if you need some creative inspiration.  I have to admit that the actual manicure/pedicure (the prep work process:  cuticles, filing, etc.) wasn't discernably better than one of those strip mall walk-in places, so it is a little more razzle dazzle than quality.  However, the final resulting look was definitely superior due to the variety of polish colors available and add-ons/style that they provide on top of the polish.  The experience was one of the best I have had because of the fun atmosphere and the joy from my inner 12-year-old who gets giddy around glitter!

***This review based on happy hour only.  I'm excited about this place.  While I was slightly disappointed in the complete lack of happy hour drink or food specials (how can you refuse to acknowledge happy hour??), by the time I left, I was still a fan.  My optimistic potential viewpoint is based on these 2 unique factors:  1) amazing rooftop bar.  Seriously.  We were up there at about 8:30pm on a 102-degree day, and it was honestly comfortable!  I had been skeptical that we'd be able to make it, but between the misters and canvas "retractable ceiling tiles," it was a pleasant way to view an amazing sunset over Camelback and Squaw Peak.  This view is fantastic and I am glad that Del Frisco's is taking full advantage of it.  This rooftop is simply cool, and made me feel like I was in a real, proper city! 2) complimentary valet.  But even better than just the complimentary valet right in front of the restaurant, the valet also has an option where you can text them 10 minutes before you're ready to go, and your car will be pulled up when you walk out.  This makes this place a very convenient place to meet up without having to deal with parking!  The cocktails and wine list were pretty standard, and we had a flatbread pizza that was really yummy.  But it was the rooftop bar and valet that will make me come back -- and next time, stay for dinner.
