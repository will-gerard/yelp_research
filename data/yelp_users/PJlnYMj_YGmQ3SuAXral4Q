I've been here twice with my girlfriends and every time I've ordered the same thing...b/c it's delicious!  The crab dip is cheesy and delicious on top of their citrus tortilla chips and the Farm Salad is worth every penny (especially with the chicken).    I am excited to bring the rest of my family to this cute little place...my favorite little place...on the corner!

The review by Jessica S. is correct -- the dressing for the salads is delicious and they put it on the side...so that is two positive things for the two stars I gave them.  However - if I pay over $10.00 for a salad...I want something OTHER than iceburg lettuce (even if it's just a little romaine and/or spinach) and pitted olives.  I asked for no grilled onions and light on the pepper -- when I received my plate, their were onions and peppers all over the place.  If you're going to offer "salads" as a main course...they should be worth it.  That was the worst $11.00 salad I've ever had.

Two of us went on a Friday night, so no surprise - there was a 45 minute wait...  But MAN - it was WELL worth it!!!  We started out with the Bruschetta, which was good (I especially loved the tomato bruschetta).  Then we split a pizza - also delish - I'm looking forward to returning and trying a different pizza every time...because all of them sounded SO GOOD.  But the real game winner was the CREPE at the end - with Nutella and Mascarpone - O.M.G. SO GOOD.  The atmosphere is fantastic, the wait staff is busy - but good, and the food is WELL worth any wait on a Friday night.  I will definitely be a "frequent" at this cute little pizzeria!!! :)

We purchased a "large room" for three hours for my birthday - and it was a terrible experience.  I thought it would be perfect because my friends love to karaoke (and drink) -- but the service was terrible and the microphones/karaoke machine continually stopped working.  At one point - it took the guy a half hour to "fix" the machine... when you consider it's $150.00 an hour - that was $75.00 we spent to just sit in a room and watch a guy attempt to get the machine to work.  Not to mention we were told that we would receive large sushi platters -- and the waitress just "thought we didn't want them".  After we finally got the platters - other people wanted to order food and the "kitchen was closed".  Would have been nice to get service/sushi right at 10:30 when we showed up.  Not to mention the $600+ bill that we had to figure out how to split ourselves (even though we were willing to pay as we go...).  The service was terrible.  This place ruined my birthday.  I wish we would have stayed at the dive bar down the street (for free) instead of paying $450.00 for all the hassle.

I'm always looking for cute places to go to brunch... and this one made the list - and passed all expectations.  The spicy bloody mary was a risk for me (not my favorite) - but it was excellent...and the food was even better.  The service, although good, was a little out of sync with the conversation at the table so it seemed like he was always interrupting us... however, girls at brunch don't really stop talking - so who can blame the guy?   Over all, great experience!

Where to start?  There were approximately 20 of us in our group, and we had called earlier in the week to make a reservation - since we knew it was a special occasion, a friends birthday, and we knew when, where, and approximately how many people would be there.    When we got there, they had given our tablyone sat down.  One of my friends was separated from the peoplee to an earlier birthday party who "still hadn't left yet"... and, by the looks of it, weren't planning on leaving any time soon.  Good for them, I wouldn't want them to rush, but the establishment should have planned a little better or figured that birthday parties/large groups would take longer.  That was frustrating, but they eventually sat us...  However, when we get to the table... the "table" is 4 spots too short... and the waiters are obviously irritated we are there.  Those of us that could, plopped down in a seat to get out of the way of the waiters... well, little did we know that was our "seat" for the rest of the night and we weren't to move.  They brought us another table or two to add on and ever in the group she knew - so everyone moved down so she could sit by people she knew.  This was while everyone was getting situated, drink orders were just being started, and WAY before we ordered food... however, one of the waiters decided to be a total prick about it and cause a scene about us "moving".  Well... if you would have counted how many guests there were and set up the table in the first place, we wouldn't be moving... you rushed us to get seated so we were out of your way - now you should just DEAL with one person moving.  Not to mention, making a scene made all of us uncomfortable.  I looked over the menu nothing looked particularly appealing (in fact, the menu is SOOOO unoriginal) - so I asked the waiter two questions - 1st, what the most popular dishes are, and 2nd, what he would order.  I took his suggestion and ordered the Combination Fajitas = Big mistake.  My steak was charred to the point where the "char taste" is all I could taste.  The shrimp was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The skillet that the meat came on was hot, but there was so much liquid on it that it didn't sizzle and the meat was luke warm (at best).  It came with white rice (yuck)...and black beans.  The black beans were the best part of this whole dish...and the sad part, is that they were just regular old black beans with a little cheese on top.  After I had tried to choke down 1 fajita, I decided I was done with the dish.  After everyone was done eating, the waiter came and asked me if I wanted a box.  He never asked me how my food was, how everything was tasting, if he could get me anything during my meal... just could he get me a box?!?!  Why would I want a box for burnt steak and cold shrimp??????  Not to mention, after I finished my greyhound, I ordered an ice tea - and after finishing my first (and only) ice tea - he never asked me if I wanted more or came around with another Tea - in fact, I couldn't get his attention to even ask for another ice tea!!!    I spent over 45.00 on a meal and a couple of drinks and I received about 1.00 worth of service and mediocre (at best) food.  With all the good options and unique restaurants in the valley - it's safe to say this place is crossed off of my "list" as far as places I will eat again.
