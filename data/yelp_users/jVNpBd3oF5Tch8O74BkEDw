Relaxed, friendly, very tasty pizza and fresh made spinach-artichoke dip. All wrapped in a cornucopia of craft beers. A great place to spend time with friends. They also have power strips in case you want to beer up with your laptop. Kinda cool.

Camelback Moving did our move a few days ago and were excellent - they were on time, personable throughout a worked very hard during very long and hot day of moving. They were exceedingly careful about my stuff and had the gear on hand to wrap and keep scuffs to as near zero as possible. The only thing broken during the move were some glasses that I did a sub-novice job packing.

My family and I have been going to Dr. Hanley (and Fran) for decades. The work and care they give our teeth is excellent and proactive. Because of it, our check ups are easy and non-scary. My wife has a condition that causes her jaw to ache after dental work is done and the amount of advance thought and planning that they do to help make exams and treatments comfortable is the best/most I have ever seen. What I love about Dr. Hanley and Fran is how they give the kind of small town care that I didn't think existed. Every visit we share stories about our families and they always remember what is going on in our lives. I cannot recommend anyone higher when I talk about dental care.

Great low key, authentic sushi hang out. Not a 'concept' sushi place. Think fish, beer, wood everywhere, retro music and chef's who cheer at you as you come in and head home.

Urban Bean lives at the top for as a coffee ( and afternoon craft ) stop. The espresso pulls are always on, the staff chat you up and the space is that perfect level of comforting white noise to hang/work/read in

Moxie is so much more than a cleaning service. They get my dry cleaning, make grocery runs and run errands that I need. Amanda is wonderful and always a fast email away to answer questions, coordinate errands and leave me feeling very comfortable that they are helping around our house.  Moxie is definitely the best.

I have been to thousands of movies and without a doubt, FilmBar is the best independent theatre I have been to. Good movie mix. The bar is worth hanging in even if you don't see a movie. Local beers on tap. They love it when you bring your slices of Humble Pie in to chomp while movie watching.

G&S is not ready for consumption. The menu is meager and the decor empty feeling (tables and chairs are of the church wedding reception kind ). Try again in a few months to see if they pull it together.

Festive with a deep beer list. Great set up if you like live bands delivering music from up on high while drinking micro brews. Lots of tv's and pretty good selection of Az brews.

Easily one of the top 5 brewing companies in Az. The space is hidden, the variety of beers created on site is surprising and the crowd very, very friendly. My fav memory is the time when a monsoon was brewing and as I had my growler reloaded with That'll Do IPA, a group coerced me in the best way possible to be the 4th hand in their trivia game.

Very tasty beer and a staff that loves the craft brew scene. Inside is a bit noisy and the patio a bit small. But if you are looking to hang out with like minded people on a sunny Saturday afternoon, the vibe here is excellent.

Stopping off for smoked olives, bacon popcorn, gourgeres, rinds and some oatmeal chocolate nitro stout. Totally yummy and a great historic space. Go immediately!

A shadow of what they were last month. Look at the reviews. Their sourdough pizza is was you see loved up over and over. As of earlier this week, pizza has been completely dropped from the menu. It seems that there has been an ownership / name change and the venue is aiming to be a live music and burger space. But oddly, lobster has been added.   Not good.

Everything fresh and well made with local ingredients matters - and it all comes together here

Check this place out on a warm night. Plenty of tables under lit trees with live music. On a quieter street, Boss is a place with very good pizza and beverages. The craft beer list had some nice options that you don't often see. The pizza is thin, crisp , tasty. The toppings are fun - I loved the spicy muffelata. Definitely worth a try.
