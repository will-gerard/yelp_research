I went here with a friend for lunch the other day with our two toddlers. We went around 11am so it wasn't busy at all. We went specifically for the Cheese Curds as our other favorite restaurant that provided them no longer has them and we had a craving!   The atmosphere was truly great. Our server was an absolute doll and super sweet. In the morning it's a self serve burger bar, so they bring you a burger and you get all the condiments and toppings yourself. I actually enjoyed that because I hate being brought out a plate with all the toppings on the side and a nasty pickle.   Anyway, the burgers we ordered were great, I loved the fries, and those cheese curds... WOW!   My in laws will be in town in a few weeks and we will be taking them for dinner to San Tan Flat because they'll love it (and I want more cheese curds)!

I've gone here tons of times and I'll touch on each of those experiences. The first time was seriously great! I went with a friend and our two toddlers for lunch and the service was great. We went for an early lunch so we were basically the only ones there, the food was good, and they brought out toys for the girls afterwards. She specifically took me there to introduce me to the cheese curds.   The next several times we went, servers were nowhere to be found most of the meal. I ordered alcoholic beverages on quite a few occasions all of which were poorly mixed, and when I notified the server that I wouldn't be drinking it because of that she just replied "oh". No refund, no remix, nothing!   We won't be going there anymore because we go primarily for the cheese curds and they haven't had them in stock for a month last we checked, so we started going to San Tan Flat instead where at least the servers can be found!   The wings are good but not good enough to sit through crummy service and horrible drinks.

Cleanest truck stop bathroom I've ever been to! I love the cleanliness but I also really like how the staff is always friendly! This is the only place we will ever stop in Gila Bend, I've had way too many bad experiences elsewhere. Great snack selection as well!

We don't eat at McDonald's on a daily basis by any means, but every now and then in a pinch, we stop here because it's less than a minute from our house.   We have yet to ever leave with our entire order 100% correct. They constantly give us the wrong food and usually leave out one or MORE things we ordered.   Staff is unpleasant and the managers don't care if you say anything. They're equally unpleasant. Would not recommend this place! I ONLY gave them two stars because the inside is clean and that's important to me.

Lavelle's is extremely fairly priced and delicious! I loved the food and the owner was very pleasant. He was able to make suggestions based on preferences I expressed and I really appreciated that.   They also have I've cream and it's delicious! They serve Boar's Head meat which is incredible, and the place is VERY clean - which I find to be highly important.   10/10 would recommend and will definitely go back!

Not at all impressed. A friend and I were recommended this place because it has fast wifi. We went there to do homework and write, and let the server know we would be there for a while, hoping they could put us in the back and out of the way.   They put us right in the front. No problem, it wasn't very busy, right? Wrong. Even though there were PLENTY of areas to sit for incoming guests (not sure why there were any incoming guests, this place is awful), we could hear all of the front of house staff standing around the host stand blatantly bad mouthing us and complaining that we were there too long.   The thing that most upsets me is WHY offer free wifi if you are going to bash people who use it! Furthermore, once confronted, the server then came back and lied when we had CLEARLY heard her.   Don't bother going here. The food is decent (I really loved the mozzarella sticks) but the service is horrible and unacceptable. I'm sad that I'll never go back because those mozzarella sticks were amazing! Get it together Native New Yorker!

Clean, friendly, and cute! The buffalo chicken wrap is TO DIE FOR! I absolutely love the way everything is setup, and the location is great. Staff is amazing, and super helpful. I went in and had an issue with my card and the staff member waited for me to get it resolved without making me feel uncomfortable. Love love love! 10/10 would eat there again, and will!
