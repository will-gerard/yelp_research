Great for Sushi on a Friday night, since it's next to everything.  Seated very quickly, which is pretty awesome for a college area on a Friday night.  Even though i was a big pain in the a$$ that night, my waitress was really nice.  I was disappointed in their lack of soft shelled crab on the sushi menu.  My favorite is the spider roll and the one choice they had was NOTHING like it, and really pricey.

Shrimp grilled tacos were awesome! And the skinny margaritas with wild berry was yummy.  I would have given it 5 stars but our waitress was pretty much useless. How do you come to a table, after being waved down, and not ask everyone if they need another drink. Specially when the glass is empty. Then we had to stop her again before she took off because two others needed a drink. Then she brings the drink back, sets it at the edge of the table and doesn't even take the empty. Had to ask for more chips, than our check, didn't see if it was separate checks even tho the second half of our party came later. We pretty much stumped her with "put 50 on the blue card and the rest on the other". Maybe she should go home, since we seemed to be bothering her.

I LOVE this place.  My favorite is the chicken Mediteranian sandwich and the thai ice tea.....could eat it every day.  It has the feel of Starbucks, with a less expensive cost....and a much bigger selection.  Quiet table in the back make it a great place to work.  Patio tables for those nice days you want to eat outside.

I've come here a few times, but this last time was probably the last time.  A small group of us went, paid cover, walked in, squeezed through the crowd to the bar, ordered drinks, as i'm waiting for my drink i keep getting smacked with some sweaty chicks hair like she's the only bitch in the place.  She's lucky i didn't have scissors in my purse.  We found a place to "stand" which was probably available because it was next to a trash.  It took about 10 minutes of watching the worst train wreck of my life for us all to decide to chug our drinks and GTFO.

Sushi was good, and it was a fun experience for my kids.  It was nice for them to try things without spending $10-$12 to find out they didn't like something.

AWESOME!!  Came right to my house.  After meeting me at a meeting to look at my windshield and letting me know I didn't have a little fill.    Showed up on time and moved around like a Nascar pit crew.  Replaced my windshield and even went further into the dash to try and find the ring I lost.  And was still done exactly when he said he would be, so I was on time to pick up kids from school.  He then checked back the next day to make sure everything sealed correctly.     Did I mention AWESOME!!!

I signed up for the text specials and was in the area and thought I would finally stop in here with my 8yr old for lunch.  First frustration came when the kids meal had 3 sandwich options, one being salami.  Maybe it's just me, but that seems like a strange choice for kids. Well my son didn't like any of the 3 choices and since you can't substitute I ended up getting him a 6 in meatball sub. because if course this sandwich didn't have a "mini" option.  I picked the roast beef and provolone or #6.  With the choice of mini, 6 in or giant I knew I was hungrier than a 6 in but there's no 12 inch option so I went with the 15 in giant.  I thought when I said #6 I was ordering a combo, but as I saw later on my receipt that was NOT the case.    And frankly I wouldn't have even posted a 1 star review if it wasn't for what I found on my receipt.    So as we are sitting there and i'm no longer starving and can focus again I take a look at my receipt.  HOLY CANOLIS!!!  a lunch for 2, well 1 and 1/2 (he's a small 8 yr old) at a sub shop came to $31.55!!!!    Yeah I know....I should have paid more attention but I WAS SOOOO HUNGRY.  So the break down is giant #6 12.45 regular meatball                        7.50 reg COMBO                              2.19 reg combo                                 2.19 YEAH.....12.45 & 7.50 was just the sandwiches!!!! Boy I'm feeling really stupid about now...but it gets better..... after my 24.33 and 1.96 tx it says ADDED TIPS!!!!!  5.26   THIS IS WHY I EVEN BOTHERED TO POST THIS.  When I brought it to the cashiers attention she said "oh you must have push the button."    UMMMM NO WAY IN HALIBUT did I accidentally tip 5.26!!  Than when the other employee came up and asked what was wrong she replied "it's adding tips again."    I NEVER look at my reciept....guess I'm too trusting.  But I'm glad I did that day.  And I can't help but wonder how many people they do this to and it never gets noticed.
