Can anything be better than the Hash House San Diego? The answer is yes... Hash House Las Vegas!   Grabbed a late lunch (can it really be lunch at 4:30pm?) and saw HH right by my clients on Sahara... I have dreams of the waffles and chicken, so I ordered up with one exception: swap a pancake for the waffles! The result: instant classic! The pancake was the size of a manhole cover and the chicken perfectly fried... Is this heaven?  Staff was fun/friendly and the location is open until 9:00pm, so I could have grabbed lunch even later if I wanted.  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes Return? Yes (uh, I'm free tomorrow!) Advocate? Yes

Doing some business in LV this week, and couldn't wait to come to this place. If the food is half as good as the reviews, this could be my favorite Greek restaurant.  The place is small... 4x4 tops and 4x2 tops, so make certain you arrive, eat, and then leave so someone else can have your table.  Good news... The Great Greek delivers! Ordered the Greek Salad (Large) with a beef skewer and it was fantastic. Quick, fresh, awesome!  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes Return? Yes Advocate? YES!

Doing some work in PHX this week, and thought I'd give Grimaldi's a shot (I've seen their billboard ads a few times). I looked at the reviews and figured "the diet is over" so let's grab a pizza.  They have a lunch special including a 6" pizza, Caesar salad and dunk for $9.49. I asked for my pizza with 1/2 pepperoni, but they can't do that (apparently the pizza are pre-made?)   Salad comes out in the smallest bread plate ever... It's good, but really small?!?  Pizza comes out and it's great! I just wish I could have had 1/2 pepperoni.  Waitress disappears upon delivery, so manager has to help me get the check?   All in all, a pretty "ok" experience... Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Sure Return? Probably not Advocate? Nope
