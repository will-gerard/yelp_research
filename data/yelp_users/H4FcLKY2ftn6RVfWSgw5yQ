This is a great place for the true enthusiast to get their tropical fish and pond needs taken care of.  Nothing quite like this local gem.  Hdden away, but worth the hunt to find.

Maybe this place grew too large, or maybe Mike &Ronda are in Flagstaff instead of here, but this is NOT the same place as it used to be. Half hour wait to get in is now the standard, but shouldn't we be able to expect hot meals and cold beverages?  * O.J. was room temperature...?!? * hash browns were just a heap of uncooked potatoes * toast was cold and soggy * had to beg other servers to keep our coffee filled * horrible service - after we got beverages, our waitress came along and started placing out more silverware & napkins on the table, as if we were invisible...?!? * when we paid, they gave us a discount, which, after the O.J., turned out to be $2 off of a $25 bill.  All that said, the potato wedges were yummy, and the biscuits are still the best anywhere.  But, truth be told, if you're looking for what the Place used to have, google Ollie's...  Their gravy is better anyway.
