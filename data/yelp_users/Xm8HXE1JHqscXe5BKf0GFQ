This is definetly a goth club. Beautiful, above-average decor, expensive drinks, please-dont-wear-that Corset Girls with their unwashed dates who secretly want, but will never get, more. I really like this place. What sold me completely? The DJ played a reeeally good mix of music. I'm old, and even I recognized both old and new stuff over the sound system. And like Sara Y mentioned, there was once a "back-in-the-day" for me but those days are gone: These days, I am in jeans.

Art Gallery house in a space that is, well, a house. There is a huge backyard that is excellent for art openings because they can set up a stage for entertainment, a small bar area, a small appetizer area (veggies with dip and some desserts), and still have room for chairs and tables, seating around a fire pit, and there is a koi pond as well.  I have found that the art varies, even by artist. I've now come to two different exhibits and I enjoyed both very much. There is a good turnout at events and exhibits will run for several weeks following an opening.  The vibe is friendly, eccentric, and casual. Street parking in the neighborhood.

Cheap prices with fast shipping and friendly phone service. I happen to go through a LOT of toys due to my dog's need to rip out their entrails in 2 minutes or less. Also, I get his glucosamine supplements here for about 50% off what I was paying retail. Awesome!

Service is excellent but I tried the corn cakes that everyone is raving about and I just don't get it. They are like pancakes, but with some veggies between them, kind of like an omelette... and then there's some pico de gallo thrown in (that was good) and served with syrup. Just my personal preference, I guess, all of those flavors didn't blend well for my taste. However, the bloody Mary was tasty and at $4 is a steal on a Sunday morning! My companions had the crab cake benedict and the bread pudding french toast (more like a dessert than a breakfast), both were excellent.

This store is gorgeous. Clean, nicely laid out, you can see everything, and the people they hire in the departments know their stuff. All employees are friendly and attentive and they treat you like gold. Products are of the highest quality and all the name brands are top-of-the-line. Of course, you get what you pay for.

I sat at the outdoor bar under a straw rooftop and the March breeze cooled down the Phoenix 90-degree March heat and I truly felt like I was in Hawaii. The margaritas were S-T-R-O-N-G and the crowd was lively and fun!

Decently priced selection of dresses. The store is clean and the employees are friendly and helpful and I didn't get the big upsell on accessories (which incidentally seemed a bit pricey, I mean, a headband for $99? Come ON).  You call ahead and make an appointment and then you spend about an hour with a consultant who brings you a few dresses based on your preferences. I had one preference only and while I kept an open mind and tried the few additional dresses she brought me, my ultimate choice was my first choice. But she was nice and helped me in and out of the gowns and explained the alterations that can be done on the dresses.  I had to choose a chain store by default for my wedding dress as my bridal party and other family members are spread throughout four different cities in two separate states, so David's Bridal was convenient and easy for me.

-1   Couldn't find my size in the drawers. +1  A nice rep found it for me. +0  Was the wrong fit.  +1 She came in and measured me and let me know my size had changed. -1  She also told me that my size will change when "you gain 10 lbs." Fellow Yelpers, you know there are photos on this site. That's all I'll say about that comment, which could really hurt someone's feelings if they really do have a weight issue. +1  The item was on sale! -1  No one working the register. -1  Same rep decides to avoid eye contact with me instead of pointing me to the lotion side of the store to open registers - I had no idea I was STANDING IN LINE at a set of registers that no one was even keyed in at.  -1  When I do realize there are other registers open, I am nearly knocked down by another customer who had to "beat" me to them so she could put $13 on her VS card account. Nice work, hon.

I disagree, this Taco Bell is NOT the best. They FOOL you into THINKING it's the best because they repeat your order back to you in the drive-thru, in the order that  you ordered the items, and then you feel confident that they got it right, then you pull up to the window and they repeat it to you AGAIN, giving you MORE false confidence, and then you check the bag and everything LOOKS right, then you drive all the way home and discover you've got the wrong items, things you didn't order, wrapped to label what you asked for.  Granted, at the end of the day, it's all the Bell and pretty much the same. So you eat it anyway. But you still harbor resentment for the trickery.

Average, clean, pseudo-pub-style restaurant with a good menu. Pricing is average or slightly less ($8-$12 for lunch) and they have a variety of tap beers as well as a full bar.  I didn't hear anyone in our party of six say anything negative about the food nor the service. The menu seems pretty straight-up to me, with no weird surprises. One person in our party ordered sweet potato fries with her food which came out crispy, the consistency of regular fries. I know how hard it is to crisp up sweet potato fries so this deserves a plus-one!  Also, my cobb salad included chunks of smoked gouda in addition to the bleu cheese. Bonus!

Came for the Happy Hour menu (5-7pm) and although the place was packed, we were seated immediately at the sushi bar. Calamari app was perfect - light, crispy, and dry - not dripping with oil like at the Scottsdale location! Three rolls, two sushi and a couple of beer/sakes later and we were stuffed and only $36 in! All the food was super-fresh. Yellowtail was a little too cold, actually, had to let it sit for a few minutes. Had to wait a little longer than I'd like to pay the check, but that's because our server clearly had too many tables to handle - when the place is packed like that, they should schedule more servers to come in.

Wow. Just... wow. Wow!   I came here for a wedding rehearsal dinner and the experience was incredible. I was in a large party and we ordered damn near one of everything on the menu and every single thing I tasted I wanted more of.  Tandoori chicken - served on a sizzling platter with seared vegetables and fall-off-the-bone tender. Had a delicious, yet mild, flavor, perfect for those venturing into Indian food for the first time. Vegetable korma is my absolute favorite. It's like a thick sauce you can eat over rice or by itself with chunks of potato in it. Very flavorful. Chicken Vindaloo is a little spicier but doesn't kill your tastebuds with heat. The spice definetly enhances the flavors in the dish. Sop it all up with rice, or garlic naan and special naan. Sooo good!

Really excellent, attentive service in a dim, romantic atmosphere. I had a fettucine dish with a mushroom cream sauce and there was a TON of mushrooms. Flourless chocolate cake has a delicious, nutty texture.   On a side note, and this is just my personal thing... I dislike being offered powdered parmesan for the entree and caesar salad had pre-shredded parmesan on top. I much prefer, in an Italian restaurant, having a block of real parmesan for the shavings.

Service is a little bit slow and the "specials" weren't explained properly. We were told by our server that $5.99 specials are on the "box" on the table - the box being a small cardboard cube display ad. A $5.99 salad was advertised and so was a $5.99 burger (which, incidentally, had mushrooms, provolone, and onion straws and was freakin' amazing). Sticking out of the cube was an ad for fish n' chips which a few people ordered. Much to all of our surprise, when the bill came with $11.99 charges for the fish n' chips, we asked the server about the lunch specials she herself pointed out to us. Her response was that she "never told (us) that."   All the food was good-to-excellent, but the flippant attitude that this young lady showed us when she herself had misled us left a bad taste in all of our mouths.

If you do get served (15 minutes after you seat yourself, hello?) your pizza choices are thin "New York style" or extra thin and crispy. I wanted "New York-Style" and what I got was thicker than Hungry Howie's with entirely too much cheese and the red sauce was strangely hotter than the crust and cheese - I burned my mouth, even after waiting a few minutes for it to cool down. There is no way in hell you're going to be able to hold a slice and fold it lengthwise with one hand - the crust is entirely too thick. This is NOT a New York style pizza.

Had some incredible seafood enchiladas here. Salmon and shrimp with veggies in tortillas with some kind of awesome rich sauce. I swapped the rice for grilled veggies. Probably loaded with oil in the marinade but it was mighty tasty! Cornbread was pretty good too. And it's not too expensive to go on a weeknight... I think I spent around $20 with a glass or two of wine.

Potato pancakes, pastrami reuben, and chicken and waffles: Extreme carbohydrate overload.   The mini potato pancake appetizer (5) is seasoned appropriately and cooked up nice and crispy around the edges, soft and warm on the inside. Applesauce and sour cream, of course.   Pastrami reuben is piled high, warm and delish, sauerkraut/dressing/swiss. Came with coleslaw (a little bland) and we upgraded to sweet potato fries (again, a little bland, and looked slightly battered...?)   Chicken and waffles - a belgian waffle made with jalapenos and corn in the batter, then they put chicken strips on top of it, and dump a load of cheddar cheese on top of the whole pile. If you like crunchy, and I do like crunchy, the chicken strips have it - almost to the point of TOO much crunch. Wear-down-your-enamel crunch. The combination of the chicken in its seasoned batter plus cheese plus corn plus spicy jalapenos plus waffle plus syrup on top of it all makes a flavor explosion (and later, a slight headache). It was HUGE too - between two people, half of it was still left on the plate.   There is also a large, beautiful display case full of every kind of pastry you can think of. We didn't make it there. I think next time I'll start with dessert so I can cram it all in...

Five Stars! I personally hate wearing jewelry. I also hate shopping. So the idea for me to pick out a wedding band sounded like absolute torture. Not so at Shane Co.!   This location has an excellent selection of wedding-related jewelry.  Employees are friendly, available, helpful, and open to your budget and taste. You can pick EVERYTHING - the band, setting, rock or rocks... they will put the whole thing together for you, or if you're like me and kind of close your eyes and point and say "okay that one" the rep will stop you in your tracks and help you narrow down to the perfect selection. I think at one point she had 9 examples laying on the felt for me to choose from. The best part of all of this? It ended up costing a lot less than I expected. Like, $1k less. Nice!

Not too thick, not too thin, good ingredients and the pizza sauce is tangy and flavorful. The hot wings are good too - not totally drenched so you can still taste both the chicken and the sauce. Delivery was on time and prices are reasonably cheap. I will definetly order from them again!

I'm a customer, and a consumer. And a booga dancer, rock n' roll ass-kicker and carboholic, by trade. The reason I say this is to reinforce to you, the semi-entertained reader, that I don't work for a glass company. I know nothing about glass. So I find it interesting that not one, but two people who work the phones here expect me to know why a chip in my shower glass is not possible (and for your information, it is possible because it exists. I don't make up fairy tales about expensive chipped glass for kicks). Okay, so let's get over the "it's not possible because it's tempered glass" statement (? I don't know what that means because like I said before, I know jack shit about glass!) I decide to move on to asking what I was originally going to ask when I first made the call: Can you fix it or send someone to check it out? "We don't repair that."  "Uh... Okay." ~silence~ Me, again: "So... what does this mean?" Her: "Well, we DON'T REPAIR that." "So this means I have to replace the whole thing?" "Yes." Here's the part where we SHOULD discuss making an appointment for someone to come out to inspect my problem or for me to come in with measurements. I mean, I thought that AMERCIAN GLASS COMPANY was a COMPANY THAT DEALS IN GLASS. But alas, I am mistaken, because instead of helpful suggestions or even a "try calling this other company instead," I end up listening to more silence. I mean, I don't really know what to ask, how abruptly "NO" she was kind of threw me off. So I say: "... okay." And the old crank hung up on me. I'm guessing she doesn't own the company because I really don't think this is how you make money.

I buy my dog food here in bulk but I would never kennel him here. I toured the kennel and the animals are kept in cages. Small ones. They also look miserable. This isn't even the cheapest place in town so I just don't get it. And they need to do clean-up once in a while because the whole kennel area reeks.

A very dear friend of mine recently had her wedding ceremony and reception here. The building looks like a house and it sits on the corner of a residential neighborhood. There is ample parking and the location is easy to find.  Inside, there is a full kitchen, separate male/female bathrooms, and two huge rooms both large enough for dancing. Valley Garden Center will provide tables of assorted sizes and chairs as well for your event, which you can set up inside or outside in the backyard.  The backyard is brick-paved with gardens, a pond, full trees providing shade and green grass. There are two large outdoor patio areas in addition to the garden area where we set up the tables for the reception dinner.  We arrived early to help set up the tables and chairs and the facility did not provide food, so her wedding was catered, and the chefs had plenty of room in both the kitchen (with island), indoor area, and outdoor tables to get the guests taken care of.  This is a very pretty place to host any type of party. I believe she had around ninety guests and we could have easily put three times that many in there.

This place is ALWAYS dirty. I just don't get it. Isn't there some kind of clean-up crew for places like this? I had a bout once and while I was in the team area (I would hardly call it a locker. Maybe a "backstage" area. Maybe) there was Gatorade sticking up the floor and getting on our wheels. When we asked for someone to come and mop the floor, the mop water smelled like puke. We also had an injury once at a bout and there were no plastic bags nor ice anywhere in the building.

This facility is really amazing. It's clean, gives each animal ample space to move about, symphony music is piped in over the speakers (soothing to animals), and adoption fees are reasonable. They keep excellent medical records on each animal that comes through their system.  I'm big on adoption. It is so, so important to me that families who want to consider having a pet should give the Humane Society a try before going anywhere else. Sure, puppies are cute for a few months, but they need training. Adult dogs have already been housebroken, many know tricks and words, and they appreciate and love you that much more, remembering where they came from and knowing your home will be their best ever.

Three words: Too Many Colors.   I was taken aback by the fifties-diner-esque magenta, sky blue and black tiles and neon lights all over the walls. My eyes were entirely too dazzled to comprehend that this is supposed to be a Mexi joint.  We ordered a taco/enchilada combo plate and the chicken fajitas with a couple of margaritas. The food was nothing to write home about. American-style mexican food, slightly less flavorful than El Torito. The margaritas (well tequila of course, with extra ice), were not too watered down and had decent flavor and gave me enough of a buzz to run across the street on the way home into oncoming traffic to get "something sweeeet!!" at CVS.

In all fairness, this is not a review for the food, but rather, a review for service in the bar. I see that not a lot of people are happy with the quality of the food and I totally get that, but since I've never ordered food at this particular Outback, I'm compelled to give five stars for the booze experiences I've had here. We've never had bad service sitting at the bar. Big draft beers are $5 or $6, normally-priced. Football or baseball is on the flat screens and it's never too crowded to find a seat. In my experience, staff has always been friendly and attentive. Occasionally I will order a side salad but only because I love the blue cheese dressing. I like coming here for a mellow night, drink or two when I just want to get out of the house without any bells nor whistles.

I ordered a mixed drink. Bartender grabs a glass, fills it 3/4 of the way with ice, pours in alcohol and soda just until the ice starts to float, and then grabs the ice scooper and adds MORE ICE TO MY GLASS.  This place blows.

We went on Saturday, the 19th. Thank god we were close enough to walk there because parking looked like a total nightmare. That only saved one b.s. hassle for us as we waited in line to get into the place.  Then we waited in line to get a wristband to drink. Then we waited in line to get into the beer garden, only to be told we need to go buy tickets outside of the beer garden to be let into it.  Waited in line for tickets.  Back to the beer garden, waited in line to be let in.  Then waited in line every time we needed a refill of our shotglass-sized beer sample.  Waiting in line is a part of life. I GET THAT. I expected a lot of people to be there and there were, but being that it was our first time there we were unaware as to the organization of the event and there are no clearly-marked signs explaining how to do things.  In addition to that, we quickly discovered that this little shin-dig was costing a little more than we expected.  $10 to get in.  Then a separate (additional) $10 to get into the beer garden.  And then once we're in there, we're still paying for the tasters on top of that. Now while I understand how a beer garden works, in my past experience with these kinds of events, your beer garden admission fee will include a certain number of tickets to use for your samples. Not so much in Scottsdale. Between two people, we were $60 in the hole before we could get to our first drink (Admission 2/$20 + Beer Garden 2/$20 + drink tickets $20).  After all of this, though, things picked up a bit. Drink lines moved fairly quickly and not every vendor was collecting all of their drink tickets. After we each had about 13 or 14 drinks, I got munchy. We left the beer garden and went looking for food, where I had the nastiest pseudo-spinach dip from, I believe it was called Arizona Bread or something like that. A miniature bread bowl filled with mayonnaise. Um, no. It seemed to me that the food booths that were set up were mostly chain restaurants like Chipotle and that hot-wing place. Not so much. I skipped eating and we went back to the beer.  Most of the people at the event (and this includes both the customers and the vendors) were in good spirits. It was a beautiful day out and everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun. Sure, all the guys had the same hair, sunglasses, and v-necked white tee shirt, and all the girls in their twenties had 40-ish haircut-and-color combinations accompanied with their GIANT fake designer purses that whapped me a few times (what the HELL do people carry around in those things?? Unless you're supplying the blow for you and ten of your friends, leave the bag at home, High-Maintenance Hon), everyone was there for the same reason - to enjoy the day and have a good time with friends.

Atmosphere is everything: you feel like you're in a wine cellar or one of those underground caves where wine is stored in Napa.  The choices are endless and the staff knows what they're talking about. It's a little pricey, but it's a cool, mellow spot that leans toward the high-end for those first impressions.

I was craving pasta with something ... something I can't make at home. Some kind of... I don't know. Comfort food with flair, if you will.  We were seated at a table in the bar area right away. Good service. Those rolls that everyone is loving were not warm, and didn't have much flavor. Neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin, too.  Entree: My escort asked the server if they carry lasagna, which they do, but don't include on the menu "along with a few other things because there's no room for it on the menu." ? I thought this was weird, as it's half a menu: one board with a wine list on one side and food on the other. It doesn't fold like a food menu, it's just the one piece, like a wine list. Maybe I wouldn't have ordered the rigatoni bolognese from the specials board had I had more choices and I wasn't about to make the server stand there and recite all the things they could make for me. Then again, had I done that, I might have found something to eat with a little more ... kick, if you will. I mean, my food was not bad. It was fine. But that's just it - it didn't blow me away. I could have made that and saved (my hot date) a few bucks. I had a glass of pinot from CA that was good. And the entertainment (drunk middle-aged women with an unhealthy obsession with Matt Lauer) was okay.  It wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but I won't be returning because it was really no big deal.  Oh, my date had that lasagna and I didn't try it, but was told "Fine." when asked how it was, and he was actually talking about the food (and not some I'm-mad-at-you-but-not-telling-you boyspeak). It looked like it had cheese on top. No shit, it's lasagna. Not a good descriptor, I know.

Terrible.  Two people, two lunches, one appetizer. The app, crab wontons, was delivered first and had a good flavorful sweet and sour sauce that I used to flavor the rest of my food. One star for the appetizer. I see that even though you may order your food on the same ticket as your date, the food comes out one at a time. Which meant that my food was delivered and since my date and I didn't care to share dishes we both sat there awkwardly waiting for his while my food got cold.  "Spicy Korean" was neither spicy nor korean, nor did it have any flavor at all. But it had a shitload of carrots for all you rabbits out there. I find it amusing that garbage restaurants think a sprinkle of sesame seeds suddenly makes food "Korean." It doesn't and your marketing sucks.  The crowning jewel of this fiasco came down to a competition between the Dan Dan Noodles and the birds. While I was attempting to choke down my too-soft spaghetti drowned in too much sugary-sweet brown sauce, little grisly bits of chicken and a handful of bean sprouts that I tried valiantly to save with some hot sauce (and failed miserably), the birds were stalking us. One bird attempted to make his domination attempt known to the other birds by yipping at them and following them around like a nagging old wife chasing her husband with a rolling pin. This continued as they waited for us to finish our food so that we could leave so that they could attack the leftovers. I eventually gave up on my food and just stopped eating; it was that bad. By the time we were finished and standing up to leave, no less than fifteen birds were advancing toward our table. We took the dirty, food-filled plates inside to turn them in but that didn't stop the birds from descending on the table in search of any bits of missed rice that may have fallen onto the ground.

I come here for the food and the angry ladies.   When I first moved to Arizona, I shopped here and observed one middle-aged woman drive over a second middle-aged woman's foot with her shopping cart in the meat section. The two began to scream at each other and it actually picked up later again on the other side of the store when one caught the other continuing to mutter toward her in the wine section... it was pretty entertaining.   The second time I came here, I was called a "slut" by a woman in her twenties in the parking lot who apparently thought I took her parking space. Unfortunately for her, there were three other empties on the other side of my car, which I joyfully pointed out to her, but that didn't seem to stop the steam coming from her ears. All that energy and hatred toward me for absolutely nothing... poor girl.

The food here is absolutely delicious! The lounge has a live piano player and homemade potato chips in small silver bowls along the bar. The wine list is short but I found a very good French red on the list and the bartender even allowed me to taste a couple of other wines when I was undecided.  I had a tomato and mozzarella salad to start, good soft thick slabs of cheese and the tomatoes came in both red and yellow slices.  Filet mignon and scallops were all cooked perfectly and the particular dish I had was served scampi-style and was absolutely smothered in garlic, which I love, breath be damned! The garlic mashed potatoes were a little flat, though. Weird.

I read other Yelp reviews before coming here and ordered accordingly: Shrimp San Remo and Stuffed Lobster. Both are very good. Shrimp San Remo is in a buttery, garlicky herb-filled broth with a slightly spicy aftertaste. The shrimp are average-sized - not too big, definetly not too small, and surround large chunks of portabella mushroom.  Filet mignon came out cooked to perfection and King crab legs are enormous and cracked tableside by your server, as are lobster claws.  The lobster is stuffed with a bread mix that contains king crab and scallops. The scallops are whole and a little over an inch in diameter. I counted two. I felt that the stuffing was a little over-the-top as it detracted from the lobster itself, which IMO should be the star of the plate. But that doesn't mean it wasn't good and I would recommend it to anyone going to The Salt Cellar for the first time, I just might not order it next time.  Some other Yelp reviews mentioned a "musty" smell - I didn't notice this at all. As in, there was no smell.  We had a five-star experience with excellent food paired with top-notch service with genuine smiles and friendliness all around. However, I have to dock a star for veggies and bread. They'll charge you a couple of bucks extra for bread to go with the shrimp, which I found odd as clearly, you need something to sop up all that tasty flavor. And the steamed veggies on the plate (zucchini, cauliflower, carrots) were obviously from a pre-cut frozen bag. The dinner salad was bagged, too - the iceberg blend that Dole carries, right down to the skinny carrot slivers. I mean, this is kind of a high-end place, so I wasn't digging that at all.

I've been to way too many sex shops. Strangely, since I've been living in Arizona, this is the only one I've been to. But then again, I came to Arizona to sort of mellow out and get away from it all.  The clothes in the windows are always what brings me in. I love the teeny skirts and cute tops they sell, and all those different types of fishnets are great for derby, what else?? There is a small selection of shoes but they're more for your average girl to wear occasionally. Not really dancer-quality. And by that I mean more in the construction way, less in the style way. Strippers can wear any shoes as long as they will last through weeks of 8-10 hour shifts. These shoes will not.  Like Sunny B. mentions in her review, there are no creeps lurking the store watching you browse with their hands in their pockets. That makes it easier to come here. I mean, the store is clean, brightly lit, and tastefully decorated. i.e., no nasty booths in the back like you get at some of these other jerk-joints.

I see a lot of mixed and not-so-hot reviews on this board but I gotta say I haven't had a questionable experience here yet, and I've been here at least five times. I personally have always had quick seating, fresh fish, fast service, and attentive servers. It's never smelled funny whenever I have eaten here and I would recommend this place for both bar and table seating (you know how you get screwed when you order sushi at the table at almost any other Japanese restaurant). Has never happened to me! Just luckie, I guess.

Stoner-themed sandwich shop? Hmmm... So you park at the seediest strip mall in Tempe and there are drunk-for-three-days-straight creeps lurking outside next to a pay phone and muttering "Cheba Hut!" at you.  There is a large wall menu inside that lists all of the different sandwiches with different weed names ("Chronic (duh)," "Griefo," "Panama Red"). I wanted an Italian salami type sandwich with jalapenos. I belly up to the register and order the "La Canna" and the cashier tells me that I can ask one of the sandwich makers down the counter to put my jalapenos on. Okay? Dunno what that's about but hey, I'm new here. Then we sit at a table and wait like 15 minutes to be called... which is kind of a long time for a sandwich. My name is called and when I go to pick up my sandwich I discover that the 15 minutes is needed to run the sandwich with meat and cheese through the toasting machine. Now they want to know what I want on it. "Jalapenos, and everything else."  "Mayo mustard?" "Yes." "Both?" "Yes, everything." "Lettuce Tomato?" "Yes, everything." "Onion pepper pickle?" We are both speaking the same language to each other so maybe the word "everything" disappears with THC-induced temporary amnesia, who knows.  The sandwich itself is on some really thick bread that is toasted so the crunchy corners really did a number tearing up my mouth. Also, as my sandwich fell apart I noticed that my prosciutto looked and tasted more like cheap bologna. Yicch.  I reeeeally wanted to like this place but since I was sober I didn't get that sense of "ohh, everything tastes so goooooood..... dude...."

Dude. Baja Fresh is GOOD. I had a shrimp diablo burrito. Now while the burrito tasted nowhere near as diablish as i would have hoped it would, it was still good. I thought it would be spicy. Not so much. But the shrimp were large, they tasted grilled, and the burrito was stuffed to the gills with them.  I noticed that at the salsa bar they now have a monthly rotation of a new flavor? Is this new or have I not been to a Baja Fresh in quite a while? Anyway, they had this awesome pineapple-onion-cilantro mixture. Sounds weird - tastes FREAKING AWESOME. I could lap up a gallon of that stuff on its own.  Another plus - customer service at this particular location is off-the-hook awesome. I left a personal belonging in the store and they held it for me to pick up the next day. Sounds typical, right? The personal belonging was cash. So yeah, they're awesome at this store.

Seriously, it's not that bad. The stage is easily seen from any angle. The bathrooms were clean and fully stocked every time I went in there. Bar prices are average. In fact, they're much cheaper than other show venues and of course, sporting events. Sure, all of those ticket "fees" are annoying, but where else can you go where that doesn't happen? Too many couch-complainers on Yelp over a $6 beer - WAAAAH!!!

I love it. I mean, I LOVE doro wat. Always have. I have been looking for good Ethiopian food ever since I left Los Angeles and I almost feel like a jerk for saying Lalibela is not the best I've ever had, but it is a close second. Besides, Ethiopian food happens to be my favorite so you really can't give me anything in any Ethiopian restaurant that I'm not going to inhale.  The best part about this place is that you can order a single-serve plate. Meaning, if you are a party of two (which we were), you are not forced to order one huge plate meant for three or four and share it by reaching across the table at each other. My date, Uncle S.P., ordered the same dish as I (chicken, beef, lentils, salad) and I added a glass of what I think is a pretty good Pinot Noir for $5! The two of us left there stuffed to the gills for around $40. I could have used more spice (as in heat); maybe I'll ask for that next time. The injera is really good, too - good, fluffy texture that just melts in your mouth.

Hidden charges, flavorless sauce, crust wasn't cooked long enough, and they delivered the wrong toppings.

Presentation was good, with a cute little mini bread bowl and the sandwiches looked stuffed. And I stress the word "looked." The bread had a nice soft consistency but the crust on the bread was HUGE. But the soup was a bit salty, one sandwich had cheese only down one side (so each half only had cheese under my left hand when I held it) and the other sandwich they forgot to put cheese on altogether. The Humdinger is supposed to be topped with "chipotle" coleslaw but all I could taste in that slaw was the pepper from the pastrami. It was kind of pricey, too. I'm not so much into paying $18 for heartburn and some farts. Next time, I'll go to Bison Witch.

You have got to be fucking kidding me.  There was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint. There are stacks of sodas with a stained apron tossed onto the top of them - better wipe those bitches down good before you slurp, people!! The license on the wall reads 2008. HOLY GOD THIS IS 2010! There is a BED that's not even hidden from view. Toothbrush and toothpaste and a shoerack! Damn, put that in the BACK ROOM not the FRONT if you so desperately need to do it. And give me a break - how busy can this place possibly get, that you need to sleep there overnight??? I shudder to think what the back kitchen looks like if they can't even pretend to make the dining area presentable.  Even my dog wouldnt eat there... but since he's missing a leg, he might need to steer clear of this place before they try to stew him up. BTW I AM ASIAN so keep the racist accusations to yourselves, white weirdos.  Okay, all joking aside: the place is GODDAMN DIRTY. PERIOD.

Holy shit, we just gave this place another chance and man, what a disappointment.   When we arrived 80% of the restaurant was full. We were seated quickly by an efficient hostess.  After 10 minutes we received water.  10 minutes after THAT our server took both drink and food orders.  Then it was another 15 before we received the drinks! Then another 10 goes by and the food comes out, fairly quickly. But they only brought out half the food. So we're all still sitting there, awkwardly, until the final two plates come out.  One of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held. So the entire plate had to be re-made.  A shrimp plate had visible veins left in the shrimp. A chicken taco plate consisted of chicken in a stale flour tortilla - with a side of rice and cabbage. No pico de gallo, no guacamole... basically, nothing to dress the tacos.  Another beer was ordered and didn't show up until we were finished eating.  So what it comes down to is this: Servers need training and the food items need to be re-evaluated.

dude. I just like it. It's hot, fast and cheap. (Kind of like someone i know... that's what she said... but I digress.) The only thing is that sometimes at night there is no manager on duty so the employees are totally fucking off and slow and will charge you the wrong total... but it's so inexpensive anyway you likely won't really notice or care. But I'm a cheapass so i noticed.

Dang this stuff is gooooood! Red curry w/chicken, spicy noodles w/beef, cashew dish (with tofu which I dont care for but the rest of it was good) and spring rolls - small, crunchy, even after take-out!  The red curry is damn near perfect and I can taste every ingredient that goes in it. The noodles, too - the food isn't overcooked nor is it overly spiced. And I like spicy. but I also like to taste my food, so yeah, I dont need to see through time while the heat radiates from my forehead while I eat! The ingredients are fresh and the food is light. I don't like rice too much but I had it to soak up some of that outstanding curry and I still don't have that "heavy" feeling from overeating... and man, did I overeat. HooWHEE I stuffed myself.

I love how I can bike here (plenty of bike racks!) and enjoy the patio outside (gorgeous days) or the crazy-dark inside (need alone time)! Drinks are good and service is excellent, especially if you are ordering food. Of course the oysters are fantastic. Fresh quality, average-to-better sized and quite inexpensive for what you're getting. We also had an order of the fried mushrooms (skip 'em - too much breading) and we enjoyed the hot wings so much we ordered a second round of those. Man, the hot wing sauce is good... and the wings are of good quality. I didn't find a fatty one in the bunch. I can't wait until it gets warmer outside, because that's where you'll find me - full and hammered!

Blows. BLOWS!!!!  The shuttle shit is so weird. As are the roped-off snaking security lines that have never been clearly labeled as long as I have been flying in and out of this airport, which is now approaching the 10-year mark.  Bud Light is $8.00.  A Wendy's value meal is $9.95. Okay, how about just the sandwich? $7.50. WHAT? Okay how about something off the dollar menu? $2.99. DUMB.  Flights - across the board, not airline-specific - are routinely cancelled with no explanation and many employees are slack-jawed, dead-eyed and disillusioned.  During my THREE HOUR reassignment to another flight I sipped a $9.50 Jack/Coke and watched a man migrate from slot machine to slot machine, not once getting so much as a cherry payout.

Uncle Joe's Pizza is a local staple and located in the non-tourist area of Fremont Street. It is legit New York. Big floppy slices and real ingredients. They have a one-topping carryout special for $10 (cheaper for a small group than the 2 slices for $4 special for individuals). I get a plain cheese... and fold those puppies up.  HOLD THE PHONE... they DELIVER TOO??? My fat-girl quest to wash myself with a rag on a stick might hit sooner knowing this tidbit of information.... Mmmmm! Lazy + delicious + cheap = extra chins

All you 2- and 3-star reviewers out there are crazy! This one is a diamond in the rough, as far as the casino goes.  Four Queens is my one and only, all-time favorite place to gamble. I go to Four Queens every time I am in Vegas. EVERY time. Every time I win any money, it happens at Four Queens. I have played blackjack, blackjack "switch," craps, keno, and even the damn SLOTS and have won money here! Uh... except at the bar. Don't bother with the video poker at the bars.  Gambling is cheap, cocktail waitresses are attentive, and staff has fun with you as well.   The only real downside is the hotel. I've been in two rooms here and the walls are pretty thin. You can hear everything - talking, flushing, even humping all the way down the hallway. And they still use those yucky multi-colored covers on the beds.   At King's Bar, you can get a huge beer in a football-shaped cup with a straw, if you're so inclined to do so.

Besides the steak special that everyone raves about which I absolutely agree with and love, this place serves an amazing breakfast menu. Ham and eggs? the ham is so big it hangs over the edge of the plate. Pancakes are fluffy and fantastic. Root beer on tap is seriously so good. I swapped my beer for a root beer. But the beer is awesome too! They brew their own and have one for every palate. Sometimes there's a wait to get a table but generally you don't have to wait too long. It's worth coming here.

Couldn't get a taxi in the middle of the day outside of Peppermill so we walked through the Riviera to get to their taxi line. I've never seen so many gaunt-cheeked, skinny, trembling addicts in one spot in my life. Locals with tracks in their arms mixed in with tourists who didn't know any better when they booked their stay here. It was beyond creepy. I mean I actually felt like I was going to get cornered and rolled if I went to the bathroom alone.

I'm somewhat new to Arizona, so when relatives from out of town said they had heard of this place on the Food Network and knew what they needed to do to get in, I figured why not?  We get off work and head over to meet them at 5:00, when the place opens. There is a small valet lot (full) and a public parking garage ($12.00) which the restaurant will validate (only $9.00, though, you still have to cough up $3.00). Our dinner companions already had a table inside which was great because there was a huge crowd outside. Inside, the restaurant is teeny-tiny, with maybe six tables that seat four or more, a few tables that seat two, and a bar area where people can eat. The bathrooms are one-at-a-time only and the ladies' toilet did not flush properly.   I scanned the menu and quickly realized that they serve pizza and some salads - that's it. So if you have any dietary restrictions you're pretty much f*cked. While we are waiting for our food to arrive my dining companions inform me that they showed up at 3:00 to secure a table. THREE?!??! and they WEREN'T the first in line either! WHAT?   Bread comes and it is homemade and delicious, with a crispy-outside, spongy-inside thing going on, and the inside was the best - soft and delicious with huge swiss-cheese-like bubbles (don't know how else to so eloquently put it). Then drink refills come. No one else is being served (so they fire up these orders TO order, not bad, okay). I didn't have salad but they looked pretty good - buffalo mozarella and fresh basil, huge slices of tomato for the caprese. Kalamatas on the baby greens salad.   Pizza comes out, finally! $12 each for personal-sized pizzas with thin crust. The four-cheese was great; you can really taste the separate flavors of the cheeses. Arugula on top. A couple of the pizzas had salami or sausage on them. Too salty (and I LOVE salt so yeah, that's saying a lot if even I am critical on that point). One pizza's crust was not burned but charred black on half of it. But it's food so it can't be perfect every time now can it.   A table of two finished/paid/left. They were the first people to finish from the first wave of customers and it was after 6:00 pm when this happened, and there was still a shitload of people outside. Meaning that if you don't line up at 3:00 to get in at 5:00, the soonest you can be seated is after 6:00 (and that's likely if you showed up between 3:30 and 4:00 for a table).   Here's where it gets tricky - we paid, but were finishing our drinks. We were NOT the only ones there taking up a first-wave table who hadn't left yet. And after paying $150 for PIZZA (give me a break, please) the hostess came over and asked us to clear out because "people waiting outside are getting upset." Hey, I can see how that sucks for them but we're customers too and so is everyone else around us who have been lounging around for this long. When we exited the restaurant the people waiting outside were giving us (and everyone else who was leaving) DIRTY looks. Bitch please - it was YOUR decision to come here and wait in this ridiculous line, for one. For two - the food isn't that great anyway. Would I ever come here again? Hell no would I ever wait in a line that long for ANYTHING, not even if they sprinkled diamonds on the overly-salty meats. Oh, and I woke up twice in the middle of the night feeling like my face was caving in on itself and had to get up to go drink water.

Delicious food, excellent service, strong cocktails, and appropriate wine choices. I had the 8 oz filet with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach salad, with a side of asparagus. All dishes at our table were cooked perfectly, including the scallops (which can be so hit-or-miss sometimes). Our server was excellent as was her busser. Timing, knowledge of the food, personality, and wine recommendations were all spot-on. You get more than what you pay for at Durant's.

Yum! My future in-laws treated me to dinner here tonight. I had shrimp and scallops with rice in a coconutty sauce and it was awesome! Correction: Jumbo-sized scallops and large shrimp. I inhaled my food and enjoyed mine so much I didn't notice what anyone else had! Great-tasting food and excellent service... i docked one star because the dishes, while delicious, were a little pricey.

This is a 4-star hotel with a lot of 5-star ameneties about it.   1. Location is fantastic. You're in a centralized location on the strip and  you can walk or shuttle it (what is that light-rail lookin' thing?) easily.  2. Check-in is a bitch. There isn't one single line - you line up at each individual employee. This is confusing and dumb and frustrating.  3. Our room was awesome. It was a suite that overlooked the pools. Came with internet, flat-screen TV, couch, fridge, two bathrooms. However, the shower water was low-pressure, lukewarm, and the sinks didn't drain properly.  4. Eating is easy. There is a fast-food court and a handful of restaurants that cover steaks, mexican, asian, brewpub. Whatever you're looking for. And room service is fucking the best EVER. Yeah, you pay a lot: It's ROOM SERVICE. But it comes fast, they don't forget anything, the portions are pretty big, and the ingredients are top-notch. You can really taste where that extra cash is going.  5. The casino bar (was there only one? that's all I saw) is overpriced at $6 for a bottled domestic, but hey - you are on the strip and the room was cheap, so suck it up.  6 & 7: The chapel and catering departments.  Top-notch since day one. Every call answered. Every voicemail returned. Every email responded to. Many choices in regards to food and even decor. They do your flowers and photos. Both are not as expensive as you would think, either. I hate flowers - my flowers were freakin BEAUTIFUL. For the ceremony, the chapel shuttles you in and out QUICK after meticulously explaining what you're supposed to be doing ("walk when I say GO!") Open bar? Not that expensive! We went with a buffet-style dinner and it was freakin delish. Long list of choices... I mean LONG... and it didn't taste like a buffet at all. Came with salads, crudites, and a dessert table in addition to the wedding cake! Open bar included red bull - now how nifty is that??  Absolutely the best, no, much much more than the best value for the price you pay.  However... they will nickel-and-dime the shit out of you. No free rooms or hefty discounts (just little tiny ones) even when you're dumping a shitload of money into one four-hour party. But at the end of the day, tally up all you spent and look at what you got and that is what makes all the difference.

No cover, strong drinks, fun atmosphere. Open 24/7. Mainly good bands. Awesome jukebox. Video poker... no cover charge! the place is small and it gets pretty packed. I've been in there with and without a band playing and without one the place is cozy enough... with a show on, standing-room-only becomes close-knit, shoulder-to-shoulder contact.   Shenanigans: I slipped my fiancee that bacon martini. He didn't eat bacon for a year after that.

"Meh. I've experienced better." As in, I've experienced LUXOR better a few years ago! There are too many elevators in weird not-obvious places to get to your room. Rooms need a fresh coat of paint and an update on the decor and the TVs are from 1995. Rusty bathroom fixtures and water-stained curtains. And the iron was a piece of shit that leaked smelly water all over the place. When we finally got it working, it took two hands: one to hold down the steam button and one to iron. So naturally, one shirt took close to 30 minutes to complete. Also, room service is not nice enough (most places, but apparently not Luxor, justify the extra $ you pay for the service by providing really good ingredients in their meals).   On the plus side, the water pressure in the shower is STRONG. I could stay in there all day.

The best BEST best BEST sweet potato fries. Good consistency with awesome seasoning! Sweet potato fries never really crisp up the way regular fries do, but there is so much flavor to these that you hardly notice they're a little limp! And served in mini silver shopping carts, which is surprisingly more cool than trying-too-hard. Burger patty is seasoned really well and is HUGE. Be careful when you order it medium-rare... it might come out a little more rare than you're expecting (soggy in the middle... but still oh so good).

Moderately-priced food with a beautiful outdoor brick-and-garden patio and simple dishes made with good quality, fresh ingredients. I had a proscuitto and mozzarella sandwich on some incredible homemade bread, similar to a ciabatta, of sorts. not really. Whatever - the point is, it's fresh and tastes amazing! One downside - the lunch menu is pretty limited with just sandwiches and salads.

Pro: open 24 hours a day Con: $2 surcharge to get it "to go" Pro: open-minded staff deals with drunks in a gentle manner "Sir, settle down please. Sir...? Please."  Con: Crabcake sandwich turned out to be two sliders... hardly what I was expecting for $14 ($12 + surcharge) plus a tip on top of that

This place is fantastic. Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor... I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits. My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata.  The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum.  After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again.

This place smells sour... grimy. Yiiccch. Service was friendly and quick and happy hour appetizers are half off. However, "no tap beers during the summer." Say what?! We tried some mini chimichangas and meatball sliders. The chimis were deep-fried and the chicken center was pasty mush. The sliders had no flavor, not enough marinara, and came with a side of fries that tasted like they had been cooked in last Tuesday's oil. One of the jucier of the roided bartenders was called "mangina" by a drunk old man and took it really personally - that was quite amusing.  Bottom line, though: It's a dirty bar, and it's just not the type of place you're supposed to see in the daytime.

This has always been one of my favorite lazy places to eat in Las Vegas. By "lazy" I mean that I don't have to do any thinking to get there or eat there - they're always open, always casual, service is always good, and food is always tasty and large. This is a diner-type restaurant that gives you a good spectrum of choices, from pancakes and omelettes to huge salads to dinner items. I have noticed recently that the menu seems to have shrunk a bit and the prices have increased by a couple o' bucks, and for that, I'm docking a star. But Studio Cafe is still a safe place to eat, especially late at night or during hung over afternoons with a group of friends - there's something on the menu for everyone and service always comes with a smile.

A friend and I split a beef shawarma, a chicken shawarma, and a couple of different types of baklavas. And a meat pie.  So we had a total of 7 items and it cost $16. Nice! My favorite was the chicken shawarma, marinated chicken and some veggies with a garlic spread wrapped in a pita which is baked on-premises. The baklava-type desserts consisted of flaky pastry with a custard-type of filling. Forgive me for not knowing the exact names of the ingredients as I know very little about the ins and outs of Middle Eastern food other than putting it IN my mouth! Some of the crusts could be a little oily around the edges. Only enough of a deterrent to remind me not to eat these every day!   Service is fast and friendly; I will definetly return!

Copper Star Coffee is super-adorable with a nice, mellow atmosphere and quiet ambience. I don't normally drink coffee so they served me up an enormous glass of iced green tea and a huge cupcake from the case. The cupcake tasted a little boxy but the iced tea was light and refreshing, and their small advertising section with flyers for local bands and other extracurricular activities just might point you in the direction of an excellent show or an interesting new hobby... it did for me. :)

Missed happy hour so we sat in the "lounge" at 6:15 for some appetizers. Crab rangoon was tasty, as were the ribs. The sauces to dip them in were bad - hot mustard was too nasaly and the cocktail sauce was just that. Service was nothing to write home about until we tried to use our Groupon and were told we needed to be in the dining room to use it. Since we spent over $50 sitting 5 feet away from the dining room this left a sour taste in my mouth. I thought the idea of using the Groupon program was to get new customers into the restaurant? Unfortunately for them, I'll flush the $ I spent on the groupon itself because I can't make it back there before it expires (next week) and no one at the restaurant/bar/lounge/non-dining-room thought it was important to fill me in on this. Funny... I couldnt tell the difference between the dining room or the "lounge" because for one, there were tables in both sections. For two, both sections were empty, so what the hell does it matter where I sit? Good job Trader Vic's - your Future Sales Prevention Program was a great success today! *** IN RESPONSE TO MANAGEMENT'S COMMENTS BELOW - I did not GO to the BAR during the HAPPY HOUR I went during OFF HOURS and paid FULL PRICE for a plate of fried vittles. GAH.

I dunno... I thought it was good.   I stuck to what I came for: a plate stacked high with lobster tails and crab legs. I shelled all of my food first, including picking the breading off of some fried scallops and tossed a few shrimp on the pile, doused the whole thing in butter and went to town. Three times. The fourth plate I did crab legs and threw some cheesy pasta shells in there because dang, sometimes I like to eat that too!  I know they have other food there, like some mexican section and an asian section. There is a teeny produce section if you want a salad. And the mini-desserts were good too!   Too bad the most recent reviews of this place are not so stellar because I did have a good experience. I may not make it back but only due to a personal preference - I had enough lobster on the same plate as the crab to have formed the opinion that I actually prefer crab to lobster, at least these small lobster tails, and I don't have to have both on the same plate again. I have done it once.   Really, with the small lobster tails though, I don't agree with the board complaints on that. I mean, it's a buffet. Do you honestly believe a restaurant is going to set out 1-lb size tails and chance the uneaten waste on THOSE?

Came here for Happy Hour and it was excellent. I had flavored $5 martinis, 75-cent oysters (which were amazingly fresh), 1/2 off their meaty, lumpy crabcakes and 1/2 off a gigantic plate of calamari. They don't open until 4:00 pm and that is my only drawback - that I can't sit there all day gorging myself and getting hammered...

What are the rules in barbecue joints that state you are required to confuse the f*ck out of paying customers every chance you get? Besides the fact that you seat yourself (sometimes), the menu (on the wall) has a long line that snakes up to it not for ordering off the wall but for picking and choosing your food like you're in a junior high cafeteria. And how dry is my meat required to be, really? There is a condiment bar but I didn't see too many condiments on it, and this is along the entrance line (full of people who are in your way). The whole thing is just awkward lugging your unevenly-weighted tray around the restaurant full of screaming mormon children.

Try not to be fooled into thinking this is a hotel. Because it's not. And if you ask for hotel services, such as clean towels not between the hours of noon and three p.m., the staff will rudely remind you that as this is technically a condominium building, there is not a housekeeping service on-site, and they will not connect you to the offsite company, here's the number, call them yourself and remember to dial 9 to get an outside line.  I didn't like this and was not aware that hotel rules don't apply here when I made my reservation, but I didn't feel like arguing so I went along with it anyway. And then I couldn't get the phone to connect to an outside line. So again, I dialed the button on the phone that says "housekeeping" even though, well, you know... there is none.  I was connected to a different person at the front desk who was not as rude as the first but did remember to tell me bluntly to "dial 9." "Yeah, I did that." He placed me on hold to call the cleaning service company himself (after I asked him to, of course). He got back on the line and told me he "can't get through to them either, how about you try using your cellphone? You do have one, don't you?"  "Yes, I have one... but this is ridiculous. I can't get a couple of clean towels?" "You better call them soon, too, because they close at 6:00 and it's now 5:45 pm." "Let me get this straight... I'm now supposed to use my personal cellphone to call an off-site company to send someone to the hotel, excuse me, CONDO, even though you advertise as a hotel on hotel websites, at 5:45 pm on a Saturday." "That's right." "Right." I hang up and use my cellphone and not only does no one answer the phone (duh, look what time it is!) but it rings to someone else's personal cellphone, too - not a cleaning company! I don't bother to leave a message or call the useless front desk again. I dont actually expect them to send someone out on a special trip but for pete's sake, they only gave us two towels to begin with and they were both sopping wet at this point.  On a side note, about two hours before this happened, I used the "concierge" button on the hotel phone to make a dinner reservation. I was placed on hold to "confirm" the reservation with the restaurant and no one ever came back. But I routinely use the hold button at my own job so I chill and wait. I wait like a pathetic doofus for probably 6-7 minutes before I realize how much time has passed and hang up. When I call back I realize that there is no concierge, it's actually the front desk answering and a different person tells me that the reservation has been made. Well then, why the f*ck didn't the first guy get back on the phone to tell me this like he said he would? Lame.

Thick cuts of handmade pasta in rich-yet-light sauces.  Garlic bread on the table.  Wines by-the-glass in the single-digit range.

Aww, a converted house just like the ones when I used to live in Venice!! I love this bar. It's hard to find and super-cozy and comfortable. Excellent beer and wine selection and the prices aren't too shabby, either. There are all kinds of nooks and crannies to hang out in and they serve small plates of comfort food. It's a bit dark inside which would drive my parents crazy, but maybe that's why I like it - keeps the cranky OLDS out.

Stale.   Stale chips, stale beer (clean the hoses!), the salsa had a weird taste to it, grilled chicken strips were rubbery...   The ranch was good. It was that thousand-calorie Restaurant Ranch that you can't buy in stores. I liked that.

I pretty much love everything there is about Greek food. I would be happy with absolutely anything off a Greek menu. That being said, you'd think I would be a little more picky considering this is a chain restaurant and not a traditional mom-and-pop shop. However, I've eaten here a few times and I've enjoyed it every time. Since it's a chain I doubt they start from scratch on every dish; however, the food has been nothing but fantastic each time I've come!  Our server pointed me toward a mid-range Greek red wine which I didn't get the name of but was mildly tart with little aftertaste. The gyro sandwich is enormous and not greasy at all, and the meat is soft and chewy. Didn't come with enough tzatziki but that's because I like to drown my french fries in it as well as putting it on my sandwich! French fries were thin-cut and crispy on the outside, chewy inside.  Happy hour specials are pretty good and they do "reverse" happy hour as well, which is later at night. The happy hour menu includes "Greek" sliders and mini pizzas which I don't think are on the regular menu.  Spanakopita is flaky and the filling is lighter than expected! There is a hummus trio that comes with yet more pita bread, but I found that I prefer the original, plain hummus. The other two flavors I don't remember that well as I didn't care for them much.  Mousaka is hearty and warm and a big dish. Awesome comfort food.  For dessert, the baklava, while awesome with complex flavors and textures, was a little heavy (and a little oily on the bottom) and served with whipped cream, which I could have done without. Overall, I like to come here because I always end up liking what I order.

The space is cozy, the drinks are cheap, and the food is homemade.   Short Version: Hot Pockets!  Long Version: Hand-crafted dinners of seasoned, good-quality meats and veggies (or vegetarian options) wrapped in a flaky, buttery, baked, melt-in-your-mouth carbo-load of a crust. The menu runs the full spectrum and includes the standard list of limey choices plus salmon, mexican choices, indian, vegetarian, and even a cheeseburger complete with french fries - IN the crust! Food is hot and fast, service is outstanding (anyone can and will help you), and the soups are to DIE for - chunky yet smooth, appropriate levels of salt, and fresh ingredients with flavor that really pops.  They also have $3 Irish Car Bombs. Boo-YEAH!

I don't know what all the complaining about the service is about, but we had excellent service at the bar. Margarita coupon on their website and it was a good even blend. I had the enchiladas, which came three on a plate and chose one of each: chicken, pork, cheese. Talk about perfect portions - they were not too big, not too small, perfect amount of zesty red sauce, thick and chewy tortillas, and came with delicious beans and a scoop of rice. There are other dinners on the menu that I am very interested in trying (garlic shrimp, anyone?). It's a nice, cozy spot, good for small groups of friends or a date.

This is a comfortable dive. I come here for the strong drinks. There is this tea-flavored vodka that they mix with a squirt of lemonade... you tend to forget that there's booze in it. And then you try to stand up and walk and you fail. Dude.

I am scared of this place. Too many loud noises and bright lights. I feel like I'm on mushrooms when I'm in here. A bad batch of mushrooms. This is an all-slots casino with no hotel attached. This means that you cannot enter, under any circumstances, if you are under 21. Not even to order food from the filthy deep-fried counter that serves up fried oreos (hell yes), fried twinkies, and a billion different kinds of hot dogs.  The oreos are cheap and dipped/fried fresh, so it's worth it to stand in a line 20-deep with a sticky floor to get to them. But actually hanging out here and gambling? No way.

I've been here twice so far and have had excellent service both times...  The food here is divine. I'm normally not a fan of lamb, but Efe's really knows what they're doing with it - fall-off-the-bone tender with no hint of gaminess whatsoever. Falafel and hummus are excellent, but standard. Lemony chicken soup was flavorful and creamy but not heavy. Apple tea was a little sweet for me, but I would recommend it - iced or hot. Even the rice is amazing, as are the beef dishes, and I love the slaw with mint. Portions are huge.  I'm docking a star as the music, while live, is louder than fcuk.

I see that the general consensus on the board is that the food is fast, fresh and simple. It sure is. I mean, not a French fry in sight. Strangely, for a place called "Zoe's" that wants to peddle kabobs and pita there isn't a tub of hummus or tzatziki in the building, and the plate was a bit dry without them. Ever hear of Maddox? His piece on Crappy Children's Artwork was likely inspired by the decor. Yiiiiich!!!

Walk-up is faster and more efficient than drive-thru. I sat for 8 - yes, EIGHT minutes today with two cars ahead of me at 3:00 pm - hardly peak hours. When I got to the window it was another THREE minutes before I was acknowledged... drove away with the wrong drink. BAH.

So for around $5 you get a sandwich which consists of meat on bread and a teeny squirt of BBQ sauce. I added a side of slaw for $1.50 and it came in a cup the size of a side of ranch.  You order your food and then they call out your number and you go get your food on a tray from the front counter. Like in a fast-food restaurant. No one is serving you. Why is there a line for "tip" on the receipt?  Make your way down the counter and the soda fountain has RC and Big Red... now there's something you don't see everyday!  My sandwich (pork) was dry as hell and featured more than a few rough edges in there, but not to worry, there is a giant vat of community BBQ (eek!) sitting next to the RC fountain. Oh, and the bun for the sandwich is pretty soft. The sauce is a bit sweet, no heat to it at all, no depth... no thanks. Dirty tables, dirty bathroom with no paper towels left in the dispenser so I had to use a paper toilet seat cover to dry my hands.  The cole slaw was tasty, tho. So... yeah.

Pretty good. Not greasy at all, the carne asada meat didn't have any strange gristle, the dining room was clean with good upkeep, and the to-go red sauce is spicy and flavorful without burning off your tastebuds.

Happy! The people who work here are super-friendly, attentive, and cook your food to order and it comes out FAST. Meals are inexpensive and I had NO issue with grease, and I ordered my hashbrowns with "the works" which included sauteed veggies and chili. The chili had a lot of meat in it, too, pretty awesome! I also had an order of biscuits and gravy and I was super-happy with that, as the biscuits were soft and chewy with just a few crunchy edges. The gravy may be a little salty for some but for me it was perfect! Even had some mystery chunks in there (sausage?) that gave the dish depth. I enjoyed it and I will be back!

Fellow Yelpers, you have hit the nail on the head with this one.   I'm originally from the East Coast and I do have opinions about seafood. Stuck-up, know-it-all opinions... and I was blown away by this restaurant.   I went to this restaurant strictly based on the reviews I read here and I had an incredible experience! We ordered a garden salad, half-dozen oysters on the half-shell, crab cakes, and the bouillabaisse.   The salad was your standard restaurant starter. Fresh vegetables and nothing fancy. But that's not what I came for. The oysters - the OYSTERS!! YES!! - were so, so good. I was sorry we had only ordered a half dozen! They were cold, fresh, shucked in front of us, and eaten in about two minutes. The "Maryland-Style" crab cakes were very meaty, with very little, if no bread at all. The seasoning was very light and I was impressed, and I am very, VERY opinionated when anyone claims "Maryland" when describing their crab dishes. The bouillabaisse had LARGE shrimp and HUGE scallops as well as mussels, clams, lobster and fish. The broth was a little too rich for my taste but I can appreciate how enjoyable the dish is. I noticed that the people seated next to us had ordered the jambalaya and a fried shrimp appetizer. Both of those dishes had the very large shrimp. On the other side of us, I overheard a man telling his server that he comes to this restaurant every time he visits Las Vegas, and was bringing his companion for the first time, who remarked about how much they enjoyed the food.   Our server was excellent. He was very friendly, offered helpful suggestions and even hinted to us that while there was a charge for an official split-plate request, there was no charge for him to bring me an extra plate... (if I wanted to split the food myself).   A great meal and I will definetly be back!

This spa is fantastic. Upscale, wood-fronted lockers. Carpet in the changing room. I felt like Goldilocks with the different temperatures of the jacuzzi/plunge pools. Juice, tea, and light snacks are included with the price of admission. Eucalyptus steam and dry sauna. And the treatments have never been anything less than five-star. I could spend all day here. I HAVE spent all day here. You can lay on a chaise longue and read a trashy magazine and listen to the water run to your heart's content. The bathrooms come with all the amenities: mouthwash? No problem! Sterilized brushes and mousse? They've got it! Curling irons, even - after a long, hot shower (and the showers have different-smelling shampoos in a few of them) I blew my hair dry and used their giant curling iron and did myself a Farrah-feather-do. Most importantly, though, the treatments are really good. They hire the best staff and everyone is always friendly and professional.

I liked it.  The restaurant is small and many of the tables were reserved, so we sat at the bar. From the moment we walked in we had nothing but good service, from being greeted, to our bartender/server, to the bussers, and even another server who had his own tables but was friendly and thanked us for coming in.  Bread is fresh and warm, mixed drinks are strong, and the caprese salad is awesome - several slices of tomato and soft mozzarella garnished with basil, kalamata olives, and roasted red peppers.  There were entirely too many fantastic-sounding dishes to choose from. I went with penne pasta with a light gorgonzola cream sauce and sausage, my hot date went with lasagna. Although I could have used a little more gorgonzola kick on my pasta, it was still cooked perfectly and the sauce was clearly homemade, not heavy, and went well with the sausage. I had a few bites of the lasagna as well and the red sauce was pretty good - not too acidic, not too sweet.  This restaurant also provides a perfect amount of food - not too much that you're going to have a ton of leftovers, but you will be pleasantly full and pricing is appropriate to that - reasonable to inexpensive. While we ate, we noticed several pizza orders were picked up. More than several. Maybe one every three minutes. I am definetly going to try the pizza next time I come in!

I like it here. They deliver pretty quickly and always have some good specials going on. Wings are spicy and the sauce gets all over... they don't skimp on the toppings, and the flavored crust is pretty awesome, too. Chicken strips are just that, nothing to write home about but they're pretty big. Salads aren't bad, either. I had a sandwich once, or was it a calzone? anyway, that was kinda weird, philly cheesesteak on the inside supposedly... won't be ordering that again. But yeah, this is my go-to place for pizza delivery.

Wow. Okay. Let me start by saying I didn't have a bad time here. I came with good friends and did enjoy the race and all the creatures that come out to see it! But this review is for the venue itself and not the entertainment.   First... there is free parking, and that is nice. Parking for such a large event is surprisingly not a problem! What is an issue is entering the venue. There are different types of tickets: the kind that are mailed to you, or picked up at the race, "will-call," if you will, and the kind that you print at home. There is a different type of scanning system for each of these tickets and there are no clearly-marked lanes for entrance into the event other than for those who are or are not carrying a backpack or other bag. We waited in a long line and then were shuffled from lane to lane to different employees holding different ticket-scanning guns when it was discovered that our group, along with a few other people, had the print-at-home tickets. This can be quite frustrating at a hillbilly bottleneck! Seating is easy to maneuver your way around at the event, but you're just so close to the racetrack itself! It's loud and the fumes can be a bit overwhelming. If you need a break, there's nowhere to go. The venue has an area for getting snacks and smoking which is a pretty tight ring around the perimeter of the stands. So tight that it's hard to have a conversation with your friends even in that area away from the racetrack.   Very few things shock me anymore... but bringing your children who range from age three to NEWBORN to any Nascar event always blows my mind.

Big huge Pro: Good selection of raw ground-up goop for my doggie! Yum yum! But for the Con: Prices aren't different than the grocery store and most of the (human food) display case was more brown-tinted than red. On top of that, I went to pay with a Groupon and got an attitude. If you don't like the discount you signed up to give away then don't participate in the program, Jack Benny.

The lunch specials are divine and hummus is fresh and delicious. I like to get the $5.99 lunch special, the gyro with a side of salad and I usually ditch the pita bread. It's a good amount of food, with or without the pita to fill you up. They don't skimp on the sauce nor the meat. Service for me has always been fast.

My furry friend has reason enough to be distrustful of those in the medical profession given a long history of unsuccessful past treatments that ended in an amputation! And he is completely at ease when he comes here. We've been here on three separate occasions so far - one was our Humane Society initial checkup, one was a heartworm follow-up, and one was an emergency sick visit. While we saw a different vet and different staff members each time we came, Mr. Dog never had any apprehension to any of the people he came into contact with here. They are all really, really great with him and his response to them definetly shows. He doesn't get nervous or scared and they have not only gotten me in "immediately" when we needed it but they have also called to follow up on the emergency visit to make sure the treatment they prescribed is working positively (it was). Pricing is not outrageous and the facility is clean and sanitary. Highly recommended.

Delish! Excellent service, ambience, and food! This is a family-owned and -run business and is totally legit. I love how authentic everything is. We had calamari, grilled eggplant, homemade pasta, and fantastic warm bread served with pesto for dipping. Everything was very, very good. Spaghetti carbonara was incredible. (But I don't understand how everything is so awesome yet they use that powdered parmesan? PLEASE switch to fresh grates off the giant block of cheese, PLEEEASE!!!) Fantastic desserts, too - probably the best tiramisu I've ever eaten, and coconut sorbet was served in a coconut shell (which I wanted to steal and make a bra out of... but I kept it under control).

Do not go here.  I received five, that's right, FIVE upsells.  1. "replace your windshield!" There are no cracks nor chips in my windshield, even since the last time I wrote one of these reviews.  2. "I need an oil change." "Let's FLUSH your ENGINE." "No." 3. "What's the package with the car wash?" "Here's one for an additional $50." Some package!  4. "Your bulbs are out; we can replace them." No... actually they aren't. 5. "Transmission fluid leaking." I happen to park in a brand-new garage and there are no drips on my floor. If I start seeing drip stains today I'm filing a lawsuit, I'm not kidding.  The car had a weird chemical smell on the inside when I drove away which I found mildly amusing as dog-drool and coffee-drip stains still decorate my dashboard and center console. They clearly didn't wipe down the inside of the car so what's with the smell? Also... I find it strange that I didn't get the air filter upsell. I happen to KNOW for a FACT that my air filter is filthy as hell, as I looked at it four days ago. Yet my receipt says "Checked-OK" next to both that one and the Cabin Air Filter. Now I'm wondering if they even changed the oil??  Oh AAAND... there are signs everywhere that read "100% HAND WASH." I sat in the lobby and watched each car go through a machine to wash it. Interesting.

I'm freakin' DONE with this place.  Every time I come here I get above-average food (good!) with poor service (bad!)  Last time I was here our server never came back to pick up our check and it took so long that i had to get up and go looking for someone else to get us some change.  This time I ordered the soup-and-half-sandwich plate. I was offered chicken noodle or French onion. I went with the onion. When the check came, I was charged extra for the soup. When my server came back to pick up my card (and she took a LONG time to come back around and wasn't even the same server as the time before... is this protocol at this restaurant?) she said "oh, yeah, that soup costs extra." Interesting, as the surcharge isn't noted on the menu and as a former server myself, I know I should have been told about this when given the choices.  I won't lie: the food is pretty hearty. But is it worth the flippant service?

Yes.  Kitchen with full-sized Frigidaire (or was it Sub-Zero?) appliances.  Dining area with breakfast table.  Full living room with sectional couch and flat TV, and a small bathroom that includes a shower.  Bedroom has a flat TV and two almost-walk-in closets. Bedroom also has a ginormous bathroom with a separate bathtub, shower, separate turlet, and that flat TV embedded in the mirror that everyone keeps raving about.   We got this enormous room for $80 a night on a WEEKEND. I doubt it's always this inexpensive.   Minus one star for the teeny swimming pool and substandard fitness facilities.

Okay... so I think the food is really, really good here, what with the use of all of that extra sweet, salty, delicious creamery butter that they add to everything to cook it in front of you... so very, very tasty... and heart-stopping! But tasty, oh, yessss...   Here's the thing, though - the food is not consistent. We had a party of 6 and shared the table with another party of 4 and everyone had a different protein. So on our side, there was one who ordered chicken, two with scallops, one with shrimp, and two with filet. The chef comes out and gets to work on rice: some had fried and some had steamed. Steamed was served first and the bowl of rice just sat in front of the customer as there was nothing to go with it yet. Then the fried rice was cooked and served, but again, that food sat untouched. Scallops were cooked first and distributed to the two people who ordered them, but veggies were not cooked yet and no one else's food was either, so the scallops sat on the plates, untouched. Next was shrimp, then filet, then finally chicken, and THEN veggies. when the Veggies were finally served the chef scooped from a large pile of sauteed vegetables and started serving the table from the inside out, so the first three people on either side of the table got the large chunks of vegetables, and the people in the outer three chairs were served what was left, which was little slivers of overcooked, mostly onions. By then my scallops, which were seared to perfection, were cold, as was my rice. The food was very tasty and seasoned correctly but most of my food was cold when I was able to finally start eating.   For $25 a plate there's gotta be a better way than this, doesn't there?

Good location and a party atmosphere on the casino floor, but  I see that casinos are now charging $20 "early check-in" fee and they also add 12% tax to the $20/night "resort fee" ... this is definetly a great deal as I got extra hair with my reservation. Hair on the pillows, hair all over the bathroom floor, and stuck to the shower door, the shower walls, and even a few bonus short and crinkly ones in the shower swirling around in the slow-draining water.

The food is slow to come out but salad and fries are decent while the quality of the beef is outstanding. Good flavors and textures on the burgers and the bun doesn't fall apart too easily, even with a rare patty. Good for hangovers.

This bar is in a good location if you're in the downtown stadium district but ... I ordered two car bombs and rather than bring them to me, the server came back and informed me how much they would be. Okay, so go get them. Then he comes back with a can of Guinness and one shot. He sets down two glasses and looks at me and says "oh, did you want a shot too?" Then he brings me my check and the car bombs are not on it. I had to remind him to go back and add them to my tab because I was leaving... immediately.

This place is pretty cool. When I first walked in I thought it was going to be lame because it's in a stripmall and frankly, a concert venue that wasn't originally built to be one won't always have the best sound quality no matter how much eggcrate  you glue to the walls. I'm also a huge snot about this kind of thing because I grew up in Los Angeles and have been to pretty much every small venue in the entire city (Roxy, el Rey, those kinds of places) and I think I know it all. (By the way, as soon as I hit thirty I woke up that morning, the day of my birthday, and instantly knew that I do not know it all. But I digress...) I saw Peaches and MEN last night and it was awesome. It's easy to get in, it's easy to move around once you're in there, it's an all-ages venue, drinks are average-priced and pretty strong, and the sound was fantastic. Plus, the bartenders are nice and serve you in the order that you approach the bar (meaning they didn't let giant tattooed tits dictate how long you must wait for your drink). In fact, everyone I encounted who works there is pretty nice too, from the bouncers to the ticket guy. I didn't see any fights last night and while I thought some of the random sections roped-off with yellow "caution" tape was kind of ... weird, I still think this is a decent enough place to see a show that not every MTV doof in town is going to show up at.

The line is lonnnnnnnng on Sunday! But I can definetly see why. A friend and I split Don's Grilled Classic sandwich, which is sliced oven baked meatloaf, bacon, grilled red onion, tomato, and jack cheese on grilled parmesan sourdough. We also split an appetizer order of the Jewish Sliders, which was three mini challah rolls filled with moist lean brisket, mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese. The sliders were absolute perfection. The bread is fresh and soft, the brisket is delicious and the potato pancakes had a nice crisp edge. This is served with a small side of brown gravy which I used sparingly, as I didn't want to drown out the flavors in the sandwich too much. That meatloaf sandwich, though, while it sounds like an absolutely indulgent and delicious idea, was a little on the salty side. Bacon was crisped up very nicely but set my salt-o-meter over the edge. Too much of a good thing? But the meatloaf slices are thick and hearty.   And today being the third time I've eaten here and I still haven't hit that pastry case yet... next time. Next time I will start with dessert...

Potato Knish - a scoop of mashed potatoes wrapped in pastry dough. I get a little side of gravy and this hangover remedy is heaven on earth.  Skip the meat-filled knish... the meat is a mixture of leftover pastrami and corned beef and it's made as one huge pie, then sliced and served to you, which means that the pastry dough doesn't cover the two biggest sides of the filling (and we all know that the dough is where it's at).  The bloody mary is a little weak, too. But this isn't a bar so why should I even complain? Also, I've never had a "rainbow cookie" and was contemplating trying one today... and there were samples on the counter. I had one sample and it blew my freaking mind. But after all that knish PLUS pierogies, I was a little potatoed up to my ears this morning so I'm gonna go back later today to get a box of those dee-freakin-licious chocolate-covered spongy pieces of heaven.

Food is exquisitely seasoned and they use good quality, fresh ingredients. I like it very spicy but too much spice can kill the real flavor. We ordered two entrees and an appetizer. The food seemed a bit small at first, but in reality, it was the perfect portion size for two people. Any more and I would have overeaten and felt as such. And don't we Americans have a distorted sense of portion, anyway?  Lots of Chinese people in this restaurant dining with their families means this place MUST be good!

Lots of attentive employees offering advice and being helpful! The nicest lady helped load our stuff into the vehicle and even laid down plastic to protect the floor of the vehicle. Each employee also offered help on how to take care of the plants.   Good selection of outdoor plants. I say this because I heard a snarky ole leddie snidely remarking to an employee about how the store doesn't have anything she likes and not enough selection. B!tch, there's 200 plants out there and they're all making me sneeze like a hyena.

Not a fan. I scraped a cornea and came in with a towel over my eyes to block the light. The receptionist made not one, not two, but THREE inappropriate jokes to my fiancee about beating me up. Then my prescriptions were wrong - one for hydrocodone, which I specifically asked them NOT to give me because it makes me nauseaous, and one for some kind of antibiotic that my regular doctor disposed of immediately and re-prescribed me something that might actually work.

The outdoor patio is the best. It's on a fantastic spot overlooking the strip and when the weather is nice in the evenings it's a perfect location to get yo' drink on. There are live bands that play outside. I had one empanada the entire night. It was awesome - light and fluffy with crispy on the outside and warm seasoned goo-beef on the inside. Will definetly order that next time I make it here. There is a ton of seating, both barstools at tables and padded patio furniture at low tables. Service is good - friendly and attentive. The bathrooms are far from the patio, though - down the dark stairs, into the dark restaurant, and down the dark hallway. So if you're drinking too much, expect to eat shit at least one time during your many trips to the can.

I am not normally a pain-in-the-ass orderer, only at Rubio's. Because they have lots of things that I like but not all in the same burrito. So I order one burrito and make about 22 changes to it.  This Rubio's got it right. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And didn't give me an attitude when they did it, either!  I love them.

I researched several different day spas before settling on this one. I made a very wise choice.   I self-parked in the parking lot and walked into the hotel. The lobby has a section that overlooks a bar and restaurant and is open-air. Outside past the seating areas is a large pool area, and beyond that, a man-made lake and the golf course. Beyond all of this is a breathtaking view of the mountains and the gorgeous Phoenix desert sky.  I found out from a friendly staff member that I was actually in the wrong area, and that the day spa is back out the front door by the front of the hotel, in its own separate building.   When you enter the spa, you go down a flight of stairs to enter the locker room. The locker area itself is small with digital locks - I liked this a lot as I don't wear jewelry, so having that coiled bracelet with a key hanging off of it always drives me batty when I'm at a spa. There were three indoor showers that I could see, and one was handicapped. Taking a shower was worth the price of admission alone! There were six showerheads coming out of the walls to hit you on all sides and one "rain" showerhead directly above me. Decent-sized steam and sauna rooms are also accessible indoors. There is a small women's outdoor area with a warm jacuzzi, a cold plunge, and three outdoor showers. There is also a main outdoor pool area with a large sitting area with outdoor fireplaces where you can order lunch. The heated pool is clean and gorgeous and has a large pond attached to it complete with lilypads and hovering dragonflies. There is a rock-wall waterfall. Oh, and the pool also has a few jets on the sides... very relaxing. They have a bunch of treatment rooms and I got a stone massage, which must have been good because my own snort/snore woke me up during the massage (NICE).  I loved the experience from beginning to end, inside and out, and plan to return very soon.

This is a $250 review, so bear with me, Brent. ;)  Three stars.. but I like the "Meh" description that two stars invokes.  Our server was not around as much as we would have liked him to be. After we were seated at our table it was quite a few minutes before he came around to take our drink orders. Then another few minutes (normal wait time plus a few extra minutes) before he came back with the drinks. The menu merely lists each dish with a price. There are no descriptions. Our server didn't suggest any of the more popular cuts of meat, didn't show us the raw tray. Didn't tell us if the beef is corn- or grass-fed. Didn't suggest any particular salads or sides. He just showed up ready to take the order. In his defense, however, I did have a few questions about the cut of beef I chose and how I might like to have it cooked, and he did seem knowledgable about that, but in my experience with a restaurant with this kind of reputation, he should be offering us recommendations and telling us a little bit about the aging process (dry or wet?) and the cooking methods. We started with salads. The chopped salad was just that: chopped lettuce, chopped cabbage, shredded cheese, tossed in a bland dressing with light consistency. I had four bites and was done. I would have had more but it was so dark in there I couldn't see well enough to pick out the cheese. The Caesar salad didn't have any actual anchovies on it but had a very strong fishy flavor. Almost too strong. The bread basket was freaking awesome. Pretzel bread, crisp parmesan crouton bread, and olive bread with huge pieces of olives baked in. I had a hard time putting that down. The bone-in filet was the best part of my date's meal and my bone-in veal (I know, I know, save me a seat in hell) was amazing. This is a steakhouse, they really know how to cook up a cut of cow. The meat was rich, tender, juicy, and had light crisp carmelization around the edges. It was perfection. However... everyone on this board has a hard-on over these lobster mashers. The lobster mashed potatoes: I do not know what the big deal is. Here we've got about three cups' worth of mashed potatoes which were heavy on the cream and butter. But on top of that rests a pile of lobster chunks. Maybe 3/4 of a cup worth. Yes, they were good 1 1/2-inch chunks, but even if I mixed up the bowl myself (which I would have to do, as the dish is obviously served this way so you can SEE the quality of the meat you're getting), there is no way I would EVER describe this as "chunks of lobster THROUGHOUT." It could have used some salt or other seasoning. And no, this is not on the menu; I expected it to be about $30, and I was about right. The lobster mashed potatoes, like the rest of the experience in the restaurant, wasn't bad. I would not describe it as bad. But the constant raving and drooling that many of the reviewers are going on and on about created an expectation for me that this restaurant did not live up to. At these prices (and in some cases LOWER than these prices), you can get more personalized service and better flavor in all of your plates in actual famous restaurants in Los Angeles and New York. I'm not trying to sound all bitched-out and bougie about it, I just feel that I was misled into thinking that things were going to be of a certain caliber in this particular restaurant, and it wasn't. I mean, the bathroom was dirty! There were wads of dirty toilet tissue thrown in the corners of the stall like in the bathroom at a Mexican beach. And the attendant in the bathroom sat in the chair with her friend who was hanging out in there with her and I could hear her proclaim very loudly that she wasn't going to hand out any more towels tonight. What the hell...? You know who did do an awesome job - the bussers and the servers. Not our table server, who merely takes the order and occasionally brings you a drink... but the actual men who are serving the food itself. There is a grip of people who work at the restaurant who actually bring out the plates of food you ordered and clean them up when you are finished and I doubt they are getting an equal split of the tips from the "main" servers. Those guys were very attentive and working hard. We did not order dessert. Our disappearing server came by and dropped the dessert menu on the table and walked off, with no mention of even coffee. The dessert menu, by the way, is a small section on a page inside the drink menu. And there are no descriptions of any of the desserts, just names and prices. If I had a question about what one or two of the desserts were, it was irrelevant because our server was nowhere to be found. And being that the salads and side were nothing to write home about, we decided against ordering dessert. So... overall, I won't be suggesting this spot nor will I be bringing guests of my own here.

I stopped by the drive-thru and picked up two burgers and an order of zucchini. The zucchini is sliced into french fry-sized sticks, which is a preference of mine. Noticing this, I was all smiles as I drove home. When I got home, I discovered two charbroiled (not fried) beef patties with shredded (not leafed) lettuce and crinkle-cut pickle slices as well as tomato, chopped onion, and ranch dressing served up on a sesame-seed bun and wrapped tightly in white food paper. The burger patties were the exact size of the bun and the burger does not fall apart when you eat it. The lettuce doesn't even fall all over you when you unwrap it - this is the most perfectly positioned stack of ingredients I have ever encountered! French fries come with your burger and they were of very good quality, a nice solid thickness (not dick-limp like McDonald's but not too thick like steak fries, either) and not greasy at all.

I came here for dinner, I came here for breakfast. I've been here for drinks. I had drinks with dinner and also with breakfast. Drinks and appetizers one afternoon, too. Not all over the same weekend but I'm not opposed to the Hat Trick so hey... maybe someday... but not at Saddle Ranch. I actually don't like the food here. It comes out on a humongous plate that's like a metal saucer on top of a wooden thing so you don't burn your hands. Presentation is everything but flavor, not so much.  Appetizer: shared a plate of nachos. Huge, no doubt about that. Not so much on the flavor end. Chips were kind of soggy and didn't hold up too well, or they sat in the kitchen too long before they came out to us.  Breakfast: I ordered an omelette described as "spicy" and I found myself asking my server for tabasco sauce and pepper. Meh. Dinner: they keep the lights on pretty low in there so it was hard to see what I was eating. I had a thick piece of cow that wasn't seasoned that well. Nothing to write home about. A huge pile of mashed potatoes. Not worth the $20-ish for the plate.   I've given it three separate chances which is more than I have given most restaurants. The reason I keep ending up in here is that it's within walking distance to me and they have those $1 (or is it $2?) drink specials on Sunday mornings. There's a lot of crazy crap on the walls and they play the Cherry Pie video every time I'm in there.  As for the nighttime scene, I've been in and out a few times... can't remember much of that, so I must have had a good time. Can't complain. I dont' mind drinking here, it's just the eating part that disappoints.   Does this one compare to the one on Sunset? Not a chance! But I'm biased in my loyalty to Los Angeles so who knows? Some who have a better time here might not have quite as much fun there, and vice versa.

I cannot believe this national chain gets away with the deplorable conditions that are found in this store. Customers clearly don't care about how they treat the merchandise (and themselves) and employees couldn't give less than a shit, either. I came here last night and the number of people in there with unhappy, tired toddlers (it was 9:30 pm) astounded me. There was an unusually high number of the under-twenty-five-years-old-with-two-or-three-small-children types, too. Checking out was a joke, as we were in the shortest line but behind a family of three that each rang up their purchases as two separate transactions... PER PERSON. But the worst part was in the men's packaged undershirt section. There was an odor in that aisle that was just indescribable. D thought it was a hidden dirty diaper. I disagree, because as a human being, I happen to know what a turd smells like and this was not a turd. It was like a half-rotted corpse extracted from the Scottsdale "Waterfront" River.  On a side note, I noticed that some other bad reviews include mentions of minorities. Let me just say that there were a lot of unwashed people in this store and they WEREN'T the minorities.

It really is the best experience - service is spot-on, food is really impressive.  I had a Manhattan which was perfectly sweet up front with a manly kickback.  Table bread is a rosemary ciabatta served with seasoned lard which I have never had before and I almost sucked down the entire little pot of it.  Bison carpaccio was goddamn astounding, albeit a bit too small for two to share, but could be fine for just one.  Of course the filet side of the porterhouse is a lot softer than the strip side, it's good to eat the strip side first and finish with the filet.  They leave the bone at the table for you if you're so inclined to scrape down that really soft, red goodness...  OH, and the potatoes? With ricotta and the poached egg? I could have drank it like a milkshake.  We skipped dessert. We didnt want to wash out the flavoring of the aftertaste of 8 months of dry age. I just kicked back and enjoyed the assy taste of the back of my own teeth for a while.   I absolutely will be returning.

Not bad. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but they have some creative options on the rolls and some kind of taco appetizer, like little mini taco shells with raw tuna and mango chunks in there. Tastes better than expected! They have now updated their nightly menu to reflect the happy hour prices they have changed on some of their menu items. Happy hour prices apply to all hours, every day, so that's kinda cool. It's not overly expensive to eat here and they have some tasty girly flavored martinis, too. The outdoor patio is nicely shaded with misters and the staff is all very friendly and attentive.

I am by NO means a fancy-club kind of drinker. I prefer comfy, dark dives... but this place is so freakin' dirty even the roaches don't hang out here. Hot and sweaty (in Arizona did A/C ever occur to you?), an indoor-smoky atmosphere, shitty music that is cranked up so loud the speakers give feedback, sketched-out patrons who stand around by themselves and stare at girls (the ones who have dates, even)... not to mention there is no tap beer and only plastic cups for mixed drinks.  ~NARF!~

I was referred to Cary by you, my Yelpers!   My car flunked smog in Az (but passes in Ca... ?) and i'm trying desperately to get my car registered here but the CA DMV and some bs on my dashboard are conspiring to smack me with a $500 fine for driving an illegal car... Actually, this is the best thing that could have happened to me. Reason being, Cary is awesome. He's just the nicest guy, very informative, had my part overnighted and finished the job faster than I could connect Yelp to Facebook! My car has turned into an official POS and I am determined to squeeze the life blood out of it because there isn't a single d!ck magnet car on the market for me to purchase right now. I told Cary to expect to see me again the next time I need service (anticipating at least 2x/year at this point... poor car!)

this place charges $5.75 for two flat-as-uck cookies surrounding no-name ice cream. They're chewy and all but that's because there's a pound of butter in each one, and you can taste it. Diddy Reise charges $1.00 for two FAT cookes with name-brand filling. In the smack-dab high-real-estate center of Westwood.  Never again.

Good ambience and excellent service and delicious food! We had four types of bruschetta on one order and two different pizzas to share. The drink selection includes Framboise Lambic (raspberry) and I had a Peroni. We were seated right away. And just to let y'all know... the food is very similar in style (size, ingredients) to that bullshit hype of a joint Pizzeria Bianco, but with a lot less salt. The menu also includes sandwiches and salads.

Good tattoo shop. Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide who's style most mirrors what you're looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. He's a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while he's working on you, and he doesn't dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). He's very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft.

Good thing I consulted Yelp... this company is great. They were on time (actually, they were early and this worked out perfectly for us), took special care in handling our items, reasonable cost, friendly, efficient, and professional. I highly recommend Camelback Moving.

Ever since I left Los Angeles I've kept an eye out for a unique, (I hate to use the word) "alternative" store where I can drop a paycheck. I couldn't even find a place that I felt comfortable shopping in when I lived in San Diego. Didn't expect to stumble upon Fetish Falls in a place like Tempe, Arizona. More importantly, I didn't expect for the prices to be as low as they are! Lots of cute purses, good tights and skirts, punk pins and belts... they have a pretty good selection in their inventory and a pole dancing class next door. I'm sold!

After filling out a lengthy application online, I was called by a rep who wanted to go over some things regarding dog ownership. The dog we chose to meet based on the photos on the website was not a good match for us, in her opinion, because he wouldn't be able to run long distances with me. I'm not a long-distance runner by any means but I do occasionally like to go for a run and bringing a dog is always fun for them, but I could see where she was coming from so I backed off.  However, she then began to tell me (or teach me?) how dogs need a routine, make sure you take them for walks, and feed them at the same time every day, and explained to me about their bowel movements and how they need to be walked after digesting... I guess she missed the part on my application where I stated that I've had two dogs already. Then she tells me about a different dog she thinks is a good match for me and a volunteer will bring the pup over to meet us (and check out our living conditions, presumably). But when I ran this by my fiancee he pointed out a different dog and wanted me to inquire on that one. When I called the rep back to discuss it, she shot me down IMMEDIATELY. "No, that dog won't be good for you." Didn't even want to discuss it. So I found that kind of unusual.  I think it's interesting that a former dog owner such as myself would have difficulty adopting an animal from a rescue organization such as this one. After all, this isn't a shelter - this is one step past a shelter, where the animals may have been on the "kill" list at another facility but this wonderful group steps in and saves them, and continues the search to find homes for them. I felt like the rep was almost judgemental in the way that she asked me questions and a few times didn't let me speak and talked over me.  So I went to the Humane Society. And guess what - we adopted from them instead, and I can bet you a million dollars the RESCUE rep would have NEVER paired me up with the one we chose, who stands, jumps, runs and plays on three perfect legs.  I believe that RESCUE does wonderful work and their intentions are commendable, but geez... lighten up a bit, will ya? Because your overzealousness definetly scared off a family who provides an excellent home.

Unpalatable.   I am a spicy food connoisseur. I like it extra hot  to eye-watering. However:  My throat and stomach are extremely sore right now from the "spicy" dishes at this place. Dear Thai Elephant Sadists: When you are running a restaurant, you need to know that when a customer requests a dish made "spicy," which is on your menu and not a special request, this is not an invitation to a staff joke where you dump two tablespoons of crushed red pepper directly into a single order. I would like to think that the dish is cooked with the heat in it to enhance flavor, not just to show off to the non-Asian folk who DARE to have the NERVE to ask for it spicy. "I'll show YOU what spicy means, DUBYA." Because I happen to be Asian, grew up on kimchee, and I can take it. Until today - this is just plain ridiculous. Who the FUCK would EVER eat it like this?? PLEASE see the photo I uploaded of this piece of broccoli with nothing but PURE CRUSHED CHILIS STUCK IN ITS BRANCHES.  If it's going to be super, ass-flaming spicy when you order it, they should tell you it's over-the-top and not intended for you to actually taste your food. I have been guzzling water and rinsing my mouth and it's going to be a few hours before I can even find something else to eat while my tastebuds and lips recover.

I got home an hour ago and I'm so thrilled with the service here -  This is actually three five-star reviews:  1. Body Scrub with Robbie  2. Massage with Robbie 3. Facial with Claudia.   Today I discovered that I have finally found one person I want working on me in terms of massage and what a good day it was! Robbie is officially my favorite masseuse. I have had massages in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, and San Diego and while I've enjoyed them all I have never written the person's name down in my day planner to remember to ask for that person next time. I did that today - with both Robbie AND Claudia. Robbie did my scrub and massage and he has a really nice touch - firm, but not too overbearing, with smooth transitions. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with him and I will be back to request him again.  I also had a facial with Claudia. Let me tell you, Claudia KNOWS her business. She took one look at me and knew exactly what kind of skin I have (and therefore what products to use on me). As she went through each stage of the facial, she explained to me exactly what each step was that she was about to slather on me and what I should expect (i.e., "Now I'm applying a pineapple and papaya [something or another], it should tingle a little bit.")   I left the hotel completely rejuvenated and impressed with my services.

Dude. BARF TIME.  FIRST of all, I ordered for delivery. The delivery driver got lost and I ended up having to walk down to the corner to meet up with her. (I still tipped her because I'm not a total dick, by the way).  I ordered two pies, one with pepperoni/pineapple and one sausage and green pepper. At first glance, I thought they messed up my order and put pepperoni on both, and forgot the green peppers. When I looked closer I discovered that their sausage is small and sliced thin, like pepperoni. I also discovered teeny tiny slivers of green peppers, about an inch long. Each topping, and we're talking by the piece of topping here, had about  a 3/4 inch of cheese between it and the next topping piece. So the place goes stinge-o on you in regards to dressing a pizza. Also, the crust was soft and flavorless. Tasted like a cross between a wheat tortilla and the cardboard box it was sitting in. (Please note, this was NOT a whole-wheat crust.) And the next day? The leftovers were so bad they went into the trash. Not a fan.

Sons of fucking bitches.   Three orders of food and when we pulled up to the drive-thru window and asked to add a taco to the order, we were told by the young man working the drive-thru window that NO, there are no "extra" tacos, they are made to order. "Yeah, we want to order one." He then responded by saying we cannot add any food to our already existing order, and that if we wanted to add any food to the order that we would have to exit the drive-thru and drive back around and get back in line again. No joke, he said "no seriously, you can't order a taco. It's business, you understand." No, I don't understand. Your business is to sell me artery-clogging food, and you are refusing to do so? To top it off, when I called later to talk to the manager, a co-worker answered the phone giggling and then finally said "uhhh. EHH ... HELLO?"  "Hi. Is this Jack in the Box?" "Uhhh. YEAH."  Looks like JITB needs to step it up on the employee training manual.

We've had really good experiences with this place. The owners and staff are mindful of our dog's anxiety and make sure he has his own blanket and toy in his "room" and also have reported back to me on his eating habits and tried different foods with him (he tends to not eat when he's worked up about being separated from us).  They give him a bath and will brush his teeth (optional/extra) and pricing is more than reasonable. The facility smells and looks clean every time I go in there.

"OMFG." That's what I kept muttering to myself as I was working through the routine. "OMFGawwwwwwddddd...."  I'm not going to bore you with my personal exercise routine and how it's different from this so it's not what i'm used to and blah blah. No one cares about that. Because if you did, then you and I would have talked about that by now. But for real... this is different than what I am used to.   The routine isn't difficult per se, so all of you non-exercisers shouldn't stop reading at this point (go check it out!). But it activates areas that you don't normally use just walking back and forth throughout your day. The movements are small with virtually no jarring impacts yet there are no long-held poses like in boring yoga. It's like Pilates, with a twist. I mean, I've done Pilates before... and I never left a Pilates class in my life feeling like I really had a real workout. And certainly not yoga, fer chrissakes, not even Bikram ever impressed me the way this low-impact routine did. I mean, the movements are fluid and I don't care how stiff you say you are, you can do them. The holding movements and repetitive motions will give you something to think about, that's for sure. It's interesting and different and the hour flies by quickly.

I gotta agree, customer service is the pits here. Two separate times I couldnt get anyone to help me because their MTV-generation hormones kept the employees busy playing grab-ass.

Dunno what it is about the food here The mango-habanero sauce was quite tasty and featuring heat with depth and not just searing heat... until after a few bites. I felt like my entire face was on fire! But that's not the problem - I dont know what they put in there but the wings will bloat you out, big time! I talked to a few people who all agreed they loosened belt buckles and farted the whole way home. So yeah, don't bring dates here! Also... they were showing the fight last night for a $5 cover charge. Our group was in the restaurant three hours before the event, yet our server felt it was necessary to inform us that if we were still in there past the time the fight started, we would be charged cover. Hold on a second: people who were in the establishment to order FOOD ... BEFORE the event starts?? No, bitch. No.

I like it a LOT. The rolls are soft and fresh, the meat is sliced thin (the way I like it), and toppings are fresh and flavorful. I had a slightly-more-than decently-sized portion in a medium Dodge City sub for $6. Knowledgable staff with good suggestions when I couldn't decide what to order. High school employees (and friendly ones, at that!) reminded me of days gone by...

This place is fucking annoying.   First of all, it's not on Priest. It's on Ray. So after I drove back and forth across the intersection three times, on a hunch I turned on Ray and shazaam, there it was.   Second: There is a sleazy jerk who came at me with the "excuse me, MISS, excuse me, MA'AM" line that sent my bullshit detector into the red zone. He proceeded to tell me that the chip in my glass isn't "that bad right NOW" but they can go ahead and contact my insurance company on my behalf to get it taken care of. Newsflash, fuckstick, there are no chips in my glass. Six pieces of glass on the car plus mirrors - no chips! Imagine that!   Third: I got the air filter upsell. The air filter is 4 months old.   One star goes to good vacuuming up the dog hair.

First thought: Hmm... smells like slop bucket....  Second thought: oh MYY...   WOAH.  WOAH... fucking WOAH!!!   I'm not going to start off with "Not to be a bitch BUT..." because let's face it, i'm going to be a raging snot bitch right now...  "So THIS is where the Comp Sci girl majors hang out..."  yeah. It was dogville, all the way.  So i'm a total twat for saying it... you should have seen the selection. Guys, you would have paid extra to go home alone. Enough said.   AAANNNDDDddd... dirty bathrooms with wide-open curtained windows that face the street and everyone walking can see right in??? GROSS me OUT to the MAX!!!

No cover and outdoor misters. Decent crowd, overpriced drinks, teeny dance floor, good selection of d'bags to giggle at. It's A.) a club, B.) in a chain hotel, C.) in Scottsdale, fer chrissakes. What more could you ask for? My only hangup was how dark they keep it in there. People in Scottsdale are generally good looking, so a little more lighting in there isn't going to hurt business one bit.  Overall... this place doesn't feature anything that really stands out.

I really don't know what's been going on with my countenance lately. Clearly, the expression on my face as I meander through these janked-out businesses in Phoenix is one that seems to scream out that I'm some kind of dumbass with a big, Santa-sized sack of cash that I just can't wait to get rid of. It's not just this place either, I somehow have had the same annoyance at a few different stores lately.   I don't really understand when the word "No" ceased to mean, well NO, and started instead to mean "Keep talking because I am just as moronic as you and might buy into your bullshit."  THREE times I had to say NO to this buffoon who tried to sell me a warranty for a pair of shoes so that they would last me a year in the Arizona sun. He was quite authoritative on his weather report and science project explaining me how the glue on the sole would separate. Really? Because I actually use my RUNNING shoes for - guess what - RUNNING, and as such, I replace them every six months - at the most. Furthermore, if the blast of heat when it really starts to get going out there was enough to melt a pair of shoes as I wear them, then wouldn't the world be coming to a nuclear end?  Three times I said no. THREE.

Inexpensive and the acrylics are TOUGH. I like the expression "hard as nails..." corny, but they lasted a long time. Service was fast and they gave me the paint job I wanted which seems simple enough but is not an easy conversation to have at most nail places (a variation of a french manicure). I only get my nails done about once every two years but I'll keep this shop in my mental rolodex.

Yummy! This is a place that serves "tapas" (read: mini appetizers) and they are tasty, nicely presented, and appropriately priced. They have some fancy flavored martinis and a few main-course dishes as well, all served to you overlooking the colorful lights and fat tourists of Fremont Street. I had a caramel apple martini which gave me a nice buzz and we had bacon-wrapped dates which were AWESOME, a small bowl of thick, creamy tomato-basil soup that is served with a mini grilled brie-cheese sandwich on a sweet-tasting bread, and a big bowl of paella complete with clams, mussels, and shrimp. The atmosphere is a cross between romantic and trendy and this place is definetly affordable.

Four stalls in the ladies' room and two had out-of-order signs on them, one had a shower curtain in place of a door, and the one remaining in working order with a door had no t.p. at 8:00 pm.

I received two calls from the driver telling me he is on his way (AFTER the time he was supposed to arrive) so I continued to wait for him as the clock ticked on... then the driver calls to tell me "I'm here" but when I looked out the window, no one was there. Turns out he went to the "west" street rather than where I was located, which was the "north" street. Didn't matter because he called to tell me this 21 minutes past the time he was supposed to arrive, so I would have missed my plane anyway. Which is exactly what ended up happening.  Very, very frustrating.

This brand-new casino opened last night and I must say, it's pretty cool. There is a huge parking structure as well as paved parking lots and plenty of good lighting for safety outside. There is a large circular bar in the center of the gaming floor, which holds a ton of slot machines and plenty of table games including blackjack and pai gow. There is a poker room and a miniscule "non-smoking" room with slots which needs some A/C, seriously. There is a hotel attached and a Shula's Steakhouse and I saw a Fatburger (hello!) and even a Boar's Head deli (yum!) No buffet and a nightclub of sorts will be opening sometime next month. The only weird thing was that we were charged $5.50 for a Bud Light at the bar but at the tables it cost $5.00. It's supposed to be a "Vegas-style resort" but the only thing that makes it so is the fact that a hotel is attached. The inside decor is similar to Casino Arizona and the slots are seriously jammed in there - in Vegas, the casinos definetly give you more breathing room. Even the small ones.

I dunno. I thought the bread was a little too thick and there was a little too much wet dripping out of the back end as I held the sandwich. I got the italian sub... thought it was going to be a cold sandwich, but the cheese was melted on top of the meat. Salami was a bit thin and the ham had just a little too much of that fake smoke flavor.   But Yelp is for my opinion, right?

I came here twice. The first time there was a long line which moved fairly quickly. The girl at the register provided neither a greeting nor a smile, and at the end of my experience I discovered the wrong drink topped with whipped cream, which I had requested none of. After she ASKED me and I said no.  The second time I came was at 3:00 in the afternoon. No line. I stood at the register for a few minutes while the one girl behind the counter looked at me, then looked back at whatever she was doing (cleaning espresso machine or something) and continued to do it. Then she stopped that and walked toward me... but ha ha, she got me, it wasn't to take my order, it was to walk directly past me to the pastry case and rearrange items. Then after that, did she come to take my order? No, she went to the sink, turning her back to me, and began washing a blender. I turned around and walked out.

I'm reviewing yet another fast food restaurant and it's not because I'm totally into grease, but because I'm admittedly overly critical of attention to detail in these drive-thru places because hello, you're driving through, usually driving AWAY, and you're too far from the restaurant to remedy the situation when you notice they foul up. I worked at a restaurant with a drive-thru when I was in high school that was run by a tough, whip-wielding family who taught us that you DON'T make mistakes. You just don't. You take steps to ensure that you are not missing anything because no one wants to drive back to bitch when mistakes are made.   With that said... not only was a special order acknowledged but not followed through, we received no ketchup (for not one but two orders of french fries), no STRAW for a soda, and they charged me an extra 27 cents for a side of sweet and sour. Which they didn't put in the bag. Now while I realize that these are minor items and to some I may be perceived as a petty crank with too much time on my hands, if this is the way you need to drink your soda while you drive, with a straw, it complicates things. If you like ketchup with your fries and at 99% of every other drive-thru in the country you don't have to ask for it, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. And paying extra for something you don't receive is really dumb.   Onto the food...  I remember back when I was a young whipper-snapper, that McRib was awesome (as long as you don't lift the bun and look at it, you're golden). While it hasn't shrank like everything else it seems, they now skimp on the sauce in a big way, and let's face it, it's the sauce that makes the sandwich. This sucks: The poor old smooshed-together McRib just isn't that great anymore. Or maybe my cranky, wrinkled-up ornery taste buds have changed. Or maybe I've finally woken up and realized that no one should ever be eating this kind of food, for any reason whatsoever.  I'm sure it's a combination of the three.

I came to Trapeze U having never had the desire to do any aerial... anything. A group of us went together and learned from the ground up (literally) some basic moves and by the end of the lesson a few hours later, we were all climbing, jumping, flipping, and flying like pros. Instructors are professional and patient and not only tell you how to perform moves one step at a time, but they explain to you they whys and hows of each move. I enjoyed it so much we are planning to return soon! This is great for parties, groups of friends hanging out, athletes who are looking for something a little bit out of the ordinary, and anyone who wants to try something new and fun!

YES YES YES.  YES.  Acai martini: delicious. Four-choice appetizer platter featuring hummus (yum!), ahi (meat??), mac and cheese (with lots of veggies and a super-homey casserole vibe) and those non-fried sweet potato fries (which were actually brown around the edges?? Hallelujah!!)  Eggplant parmesan - so perfect. I guarantee you can't tell the difference between this one and the deep-fried nightmare that normally is what eggplant parm is.   Here's the thing - I'm a total carnivore, and I'm also someone who starts thinking about my next meal as early as while I'm still eating my current meal. Not this time! This was an almost completely meat-free night and I stayed full for the remainder of the evening!   Excellent, friendly service as well!

So this place sits facing the Pussycat Dolls blackjack tables, hence, it is loud as all hell. The loud comes from the tables, as this small restaurant is completely open with no walls to separate you from passersby on the walkway. We were seated immediately but not acknowledged for a good 15 minutes or so. Drink orders were taken as well as food orders, as we were all starving by then. Food didn't come for another 40 (forty?!?!) minutes and here's how it went: One plain cheeseburger was cut in half as requested to split between two children. One cheeseburger didn't show up. "Oh, I thought you wanted to split that between the THREE of you." Um, one adult splitting one burger between herself and two kids? Never heard of it. One burger was raw in the middle. As in, red-mush raw. And one order was perfect in every way: a breakfast burrito which came with eggs, french fries, and sausage gravy wrapped in a warm tortilla with a side of more french fries. So yeah, service leaves much to be desired and I dont know how clean the kitchen is but the cooks certainly aren't that attentive to their raw-meat-handling either. This is a fairly new spot (I hear it opened in March 2010) so maybe they still need to work out the kinks. Salmonella kinks.

I haven't been back to Maryland in several years and I'm always wary of any crabcake recommendations outside of Baltimore as they have been wrong a complete and utterly disappointing 100% of the time. However, Yelp's users have not let me down in the past and I stumbled upon the reviews for Ernie's purely by accident. The descriptions of the seafood had a pretty authentic-sounding familiarity to them, so I gave in and decided to give this place a try, and woah, this was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I ordered a plate that included both a crabcake and some shrimp, just in case the crabcake was inedible, that way I would have something to fall back on. The plate came with a choice of starch with soup or salad to start. As much as I love-love-love crab soup, I hadn't had a fresh vegetable in two or three days so I opted for the salad. When the salad came to the table I knew I was in the right place. It was lettuce (of course) topped with croutons, tomato, and cucumber. The one thing that convinced me that this place is authentic? A sprinkling of black olives over the salad. NO ONE outside of Baltimore does this! At that moment I knew I was going to be able to eat my dinner. When my actual food came the crab cake had thick lumps of crab held together with just the perfect amount of seasoned bread/egg mixture. I loved every bite of it. My personal taste dictates a much heavier dose of Old Bay, however, my steamed shrimp came with more than a liberal distribution of my favorite seasoning. Easy fix: I mixed a little of the extra that was on the shrimp, which were meaty and abundant, with every bite of the best crabcake outside of Baltimore.  After dinner, I signed up for the email list for steamed crabs. I even called my parents in California and told them where I was taking them for dinner the next time they come visit.

No windows, so it's kind of dreary inside. Fancy lighting on the walls that changes color. I had a breakfast skillet that was mostly potatoes, the sausage was cheap skinny link sausage that had been sliced into discs, and flavor was lacking somewhere. I needed to add salt and ketchup, and I don't even like ketchup on my breakfast foods. Too many potatoes. And the price for a dish was about a dollar or two more than it should be.

I have been here three times and each time I obtained my services with a different employee, thinking that my disappointment in the quality of the job was specific to my individual and possibly inexperienced waxer. Well... I guess it took me three visits to realize that you absolutely get what you pay for in life, and when you pay cheap for a wax, you get missed spots. Big, obvious missed spots. Being Asian, I'm no Sasquatch but I sure do feel like one after the next-day inspection following a job done at European Wax Center. Yuck.

Maryland Crab Cake.   Oh, and the fried zucchini is pretty good, although I prefer sticks, it's cut in disks and the breading is quite tasty. French fries are nice and crispy, too. Ambience isn't quite like the other location - this one has more trendy decor. But who cares because the food is the same and they have the same fantastic MARYLAND. CRAB. CAKES.  ~drool~

A cute, cozy spot, with perfectly attentive service and fabulous and inexpensive food. A Sunday morning mimosa pitcher was a delicious accompaniment to breakfast sandwiches and the most amazing sandwich I've had in a long time: a BLT with tempura shrimp and avocado aioli. First of all, the shrimp were jumbo-sized. And the whole thing put together was really interesting and good! The bacon was both thick and crispy. Can't wait to come back and try more things from the menu!

Really enjoyed this place. We had an EXCELLENT server and goddamn if I didn't forget his name already (Aaron? Eric? Sorry, dude...) LOTS of different types of tequila and our server really knew his stuff. I'm not much of a tequila drinker (too many shots of Patron followed by an 18-hour bout of hugging porcelain many, many moons ago) but he pointed me toward a few types that either had a slightly sweet or non-existent aftertaste that went down smoothly, with no lime needed. Nice! Food was good too - mini tacos are tasty and come three to an order. You do have to pay for chips and salsa but the chips are to freaking DIE for, thin, warm, crispy, fresh, salty, PERFECT.

Is it the GREATEST SANDWICH ON EARTH? Hell no! But it's fast and inexpensive with crisp-tasting ingredients, and served on really fresh, good-quality bread. It is very good. Service is quick and efficient and the restaurant is clean. The menu is easy to maneuver and I hear they deliver, too.

This was the best facial I have ever had.   The products are all-natural and extremely gentle on your skin. My face has been completely smooth and blemish-free since my treatment (one week). I actually wanted to wait a few days longer to write the review to see how my skin would fare but I don't see any signs of this letting up - it really looks and feels fantastic.   There are a LOT of options on their "menu" that are designed to help save you some money on your treatments - check the website under "membership." I am extremely pleased with the treatment I received.

This place is like an outdoor garden at someone's great-aunt's home in the Hamptons. We were seated immediately at a wrought-iron table outside under some misters and handed menus. It was a good 10 minutes before our server came out to take our beverage order and the only reason I stayed that long was because my escort excused himself to take a phone call. However, when our server did come by, she was super-nice. My Bee Eff had two eggs with bacon and I ordered some Frenchie-sounding crepe dish with ham and gruyere cheese, "with a creamy bechamel sauce." Another 10 minutes goes by before she drops off our iced tea and orange juice, which are served in those wine-looking water glasses with the stems, and they're both sucked down pretty fast. And then we've got two empty glasses on the table, and no one ever comes back to see if we need a refill. At this point I am periodically checking the time because hey, it's hot outside and we have nothing to drink, and our server is seemingly nowhere in sight! Several minutes pass before she drops off a carafe of iced tea and some waters. Another TWENTY minutes and our food comes out, his is missing toast and mine looks revolting. But I'm really into crepes and I'm pretty open-minded about food so I dive in. Another five minutes goes by before he gets his toast and is told that there is no tabasco sauce anywhere in the building, nor in the building across the street that servers have had to run to in order to get things that are obviously missing from the restaurant (it seems that the company owns both properties but you'd think they would keep all of their restaurant stuff in one convenient location...).  My date's food was "eh, no big deal. Eggs and bacon... you really can't screw that up."  My crepes were the best part of the dish. They were the perfect consistency, thin, no lumps, no weird fried edges. I liked the CREPES. However... I was under the impression that the filling was to be ham and gruyere and it was ham lunchmeat only, not what I was expecting. The crepes were swimming in a watery, milky sauce that needed salt or some other seasoning (not quite the creamy bechamel I was expecting) and the gruyere was sprinkled across the top. So visually, if you can picture this: White cat vomit. But I was starving at that point and I liked the crepes part so I ate it.  And then I wanted to pay and leave. And we couldn't even do that because like the entire experience thus far: no server to be found. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike her. I mean, when she did come around, she was one of the nicest servers I've ever had. She was just inattentive to her tables on the front patio. Getting the check took another fifteen and then I was ready to pay and it took so much longer waiting for no one to come back that it got to the point where I had to get up, go inside and stand in the kitchen while someone else rang me up.   Bottom line: Mediocre, overpriced food ($40 for two small breakfasts and no booze), shit service. Not going back.

A very extensive tap beer selection and the menu features several delicious small-plate apps. I had cheese puffs and the shrimp appetizer and both were prepared beautifully and with good, interesting flavors. Service is not intrusive and the use of space and seating is comfortable and upscale. I was not fortunate enough to see live music, but the stage is positioned well for good viewing. I will make it back here when I am in the downtown area.

I have to be honest, I didn't want to write a review on my favorite business because I have to keep a few hidden gems of Tempe all to my uber-selfish self. But dude... this is the best workout in Phoenix, and definetly the best I have ever done for myself.  The workout is different every day. Your trainer will create exercises for you to complete that will target groups of muscles to work together rather than just one repetitive gym machine motion. You will use different kinds of props to keep you distracted from the task at hand, such as dumbbells, kettlebells, ropes, tires, sledgehammers, pull up bars, and your own pathetic, grunting ass.  Is it difficult? Absolutely! It will kick your ass from start to finish! But it's over faster than you think, and the combination of strength training + cardio keeps your metabolism humming for hours.  And if you want to see what this workout has done for me, I uploaded my own photos for your viewing pleasure.

Expensive breakfast, but heavenly. I had the salmon eggs benedict, my friend the crab and arugula omelet, and we shared an order of the creme brulee french toast. The salmon eggs benedict was three small muffin halves piled high with good-quality fish, thick sauce and perfectly-poached eggs. My friend's egg-white omelet was large and came with a side of tomatoes, but the crab was a little strong. Might have been the last of the batch? But the french toast was to die for. Two of the thickest slices of bread with a not-too-sweet egg custard layer sandwiched between, with the crispy sugar layer on the top slice of toast. Served with real whipped cream, and berries on the side. The kitchen was a little slow but the food - and service - amazing.

Oh thank god we stumbled upon this place in the midst of $40-per-plate restaurants. I had an excellent burger cooked perfectly plus you can get a steak there or other random things like spring rolls or lobster corn dogs. My friend had the fish tacos and there were three of them and on full-sized corn tortillas - not the smaller ones like you would expect. Good casual kick-back food at $15-$30, much less than most of the restaurants in this area of the casino.

Okay. I just came from the best skin treatment. The office is clean and spacious, prices are totally reasonable and the gal who worked on me explained what she was doing, why she was doing it, told me a thing or two about my skin type and how it would react to treatment, and the lasering was completely painless and quick! I highly recommend that you call and make an appointment with Angel Brant - she was fantastic! I have had skin treatments before but never without that stinging, rubber-band pinch with the burning smell. I am very surprised and satisfied with the service.
