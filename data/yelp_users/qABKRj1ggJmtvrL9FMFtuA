I came here years ago to see Henry Rollins Spoken word. (Totally awesome by the way: five stars.) The seats here though were absolutely HORRENDOUS! Now I'm 5'11" so I'm used to not having a lot of leg room so I'm used to sitting sideways so my knees aren't banging into the seat in from of me. Here, legs to the side and I'm still rammed up against the next row. It was like being in a three hour yoga pose.   I have never before and never since seen rows of seats so close to eat other. Only my sister in law could sit comfortably and she's 5'1". Come on Celebrity Theatre, just a couple more inches. Size really does matter. If anyone told you otherwise, they were lying.

I tagged along last minute on Tuesday night with some friends to see They Promised Us Jetpacks. It reminded me a lot of Hollywood Alley but I like the Rhythm Room better somehow. Loud but not too loud, crowded but not too crowded and enough character without leaving the floor as sticky as a porn shop. In other words, Goldilocks would feel right at home.

I ate here with Abu J a while back and had a tasty lunch of a sirloin sandwich and mashed potatoes.  While hardly dietetic, it was tasty and even left me some lunch for the next day.  The steak was nice and rare, grilled onions and potatoes mashed more in the french style, a little gluey, but in a good way.  Tasty.  Abu J had his usual cheeseburger (though no anymore).  I'm sure I'll be here again sometime as he has his "paper route" and doesn't care much to deviate from it.

This is the best one yet (out of all of the My Sister's Closets). I've found so many yummy things here. Cashmere sweaters, designer jeans (Sevens, AG and People's Republic), Coach sandals, a Prada moon bag and some Juicy Couture dresses - and those are just the highlights. They're very picky what they accept when you consign, but that's what makes them a good consignment shop and their prices are really pretty good. I always stop here after Last Chance. It completes my shopping day and a good deal makes me happy. Forget Prozac, what we need are Prada bags for $200 (it was a super sale day - and I'm not on Prozac, just being facetious).

This place never fails to please me.  If you have out of town guests it's a great place to bring them.  My favorite breakfast is their commuter sandwich with smoked salmon and avocado and I've been here for dinner too and dare I say it?  Their pizza is even better than Bianco's!

Long story short, the quote to do the maintenance and a few repairs on my RX at Bell Lexus was $800 less than at Scottsdale Lexus and they could guarantee me an RX loaner (I needed the rear air and room for the stroller). Now I'm frugal so I would have driven all the way up there from Ahwatukee to save $100 but $800! That's crazy! Not only that, but they found things that Scottsdale Lexus didn't find and they were real, honest-to-god problems because my car quit making the exhaust leak sound after they fixed it (when it never had an exhaust leak). I'll definitely keep driving up there. It's farther away but it's by far worth it for the quality of service and the savings.

I've been through better but this one aint bad.  I love the smell of airports too.  It reminds me of going somewhere fun.  At least it does since I don't travel for work anymore.  Sky Harbor has the average food choices, has been decently upgraded, parking is OK.  I really don't have much to complain about.

Very friendly teachers and staff, but definitely not the place for us.  I didn't realize until our tour that the Waldorf method advocates no books, but all copying off the chalkboard, no black crayons or colored pencils, no reading until age seven or eight because "the children's souls aren't developed enough", the same teacher from first to eighth grade to act as the children's spiritual guide and a slew of other peculiar rules.  I realize this may appeal to many, but it certainly didn't fit our needs or beliefs.

Consistently good, but consistently slow. The rolls are great though and they will make substitutions. Ada G. and I love the Baked Scallop roll and their Ahi Tetaki Salad is a favorite too. We've smartened up and gotten the toddler his own ahi roll on occasion so he wouldn't eat all of ours and peace was maintained. (How do they do this in the UN? It's exhausting!) When you order a large Sapporo you get a 50 cent seaweed salad too! Don't you love a bargain?   When I came here when I was gainfully employed, lunch would always take an hour and a half so don't expect something quick, but it's always good. My husband doesn't care for it as much because he considers himself to be a true connoisseur but I like the rolls so I'm right at home here.

While I absolutely hate going here, it's dirty, noisy and full of kids, my sweet pea loves it so we had his last two birthday parties here.  They took good care of us and were in charge so I didn't have to heard kids around.  I just wish the place weren't so dirty.

I've been here before and normally I think they're really overpriced.  I mean really.  Cheese and chocolate doesn't cost THAT much but they just started a happy hour I went to with Ada G. and another friend and for that their prices are great.  $4 fondue and $6 cocktails.  All of their cocktails are overly sweet and their house wines are on the cheap side, but you get what you pay for.  Nothing's bad, just not great.  The fondue on the other hand is great.  We coerced Ada G. into the dark chocolate and ordered it with extra strawberries.  Heavenly.  We joked we'd be back every Tuesday after we picked up our CSA veggies.  Maybe we weren't joking?

I stopped by quickly on my way to meet Sarah M. for lunch at Ra.  I came to a good stopping point working and  thought I might be able to pick out some workout clothes (I will soon be voted out of Pilates, if possible, for wearing the same stinky clothes day after day).  What can I say.  I scored a pair of leggings and a jacket but a security guard is permanently posted by the door and the floor of the dressing room floor is adorned with dirty bandages.  I waited in line my requisite ten minutes and bately made it to lunch on time.  I'll be here again for my annual requisite visit.  What choice do I have.  I need something to completely skeeve me out now and then.

Everything is edible but compared to filibertos it pales in comparison. Their breakfast burritos always need a little salt and plenty of salsa to liven them up.

I can't get enough of their vegetarian gyro.  It's filled with lettuce, tomatoes, tons of feta and tzatziki.  There isn't much ambiance but the food is great, cheap and fast.  Their fries are tasty too, and I'm generally not much of a french fry person, and come in the cutest little brown paper bags.

well, first off they lied to us about their special and told us we could only get one topping per pizza when clearly advertised on the window was two topping.  While I'm sure this wasn't out of malice, just negligence, it was annoying.  My black olives prefer to be accompanied by mushrooms.  Secondly, their crust is the wonder bread equivalent of pizza dough.  Soft, airy and no chewiness at all.  I think we will stick with Little Caesars from now on when we want cheap pizzas.

Old Navy isn't usually a place where I buy clothes for myself but it's great to pick up shorts and swim trunks for the toddler and the Ahwatukee store is by far the best because not only did they give me a price adjustment when everything went 30% off, they still honored the $10 off coupon I had used when I made my original purchase which had expired by the time I had gotten the price adjustment. To top it off, it took a little while for them to figure out how to get the computer to take an expired coupon so to make up for me waiting (and they were doing me a favor, I didn't mind waiting at all), they gave me a $5 gift card! They're so accommodating, what's not to love?

Well, if it were just the food I was reviewing it would be a two and the ambiance is cowboy-ish which really isn't my thing but my eight year old adores this place.  Before cub scouts if we don't have the baby we will come for happy hour and he will spend the entire time going down the slide.  The very best part, in the eyes of an eight year old boy, they have free cotton candy for dessert!  He's found his mecca.

My hard drive was going out on my PC so under Abu J's advice, I took it in to Data Doctor's.  They're repairing it as we speak and I found them to be professional, efficient and knowledgeable.  Their prices are just OK, but with a PC I need to get back up and running, that wasn't a deal breaker.

We lived in Ahwatukee for probably a good 4 1/2 years before we ever tried Star of India and I have no idea what was stopping us. (To think of all that wasted time we could have had together...) We met some friends for dinner here because she worked with a bunch of Indian guys and they said it was the place place they found in Phoenix. I've probably only been to maybe five different Indian restaurants in Phoenix, but so far, I'd have to agree.   Some particular delicacies you'll find are in the Chef's Selection area of the menu. My husband can't get enough of the Lamb Frazee (I think that's what it is). I can't go for a visit without the Aloo Gobi (in the vegetarian section).   The lamb frazee on the chef's specials my husband LOVES! It think it's the first one on the list. I can't go without ordering aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower) and a side of raita. My favorite time is actually lunch when the have a nice buffet with at least three different main courses and probably three different vegetable courses (almost always aloo gobi is there too). At lunch they bring around naan to everyone but if you request garlic naan, they will oblige. You also will get a plate of tandoori chicken - so good! The toddler loves coming here with us. He eats off both our plates and waits (most often impatiently) for desert. Our favorite (and they're always on the buffet) are those little cold, wet donut balls. God, I love those things. (Though my personal description does them no justice.)   I ate here throughout my entire pregnancy so maybe that's why the toddler has a taste for spicy ethnic food. (That could also explain his love for ahi...) Either way he's always happy to come, as am I.   It's priced well and everyone is so friendly and sweet. They're always bringing out extra treats for Beckham (the toddler) like rice pudding and if you haven't been in for a while, they still remember you and greet you like an old friend. Maybe I can talk the husband into going here for dinner tonight? Nothing says Easter Sunday like a little curry, am I right? Jesus didn't sound like a picky guy. And with party tricks like water into wine, surely he would have been up for some curry...

This has been my dentist now for the last 12 years or so and I have even referred some friends and they liked it too.  It's easy to beta appointment, I've had together couple of fillings and I'm a complete wimp for dental stuff and they were always patient and sweet.   I won't let anyone but Dr Mattern work on my teeth.

I just got a cute little Hyundai here on Friday after getting into a pileup on 101 with my sweet pea the night before.  My insurance arranged the rental and Enterprise was calling me the next morning right when they opened to arrange pickup.  They were friendly and efficient, what more could I ask for?

There's not too much to say because it is a dentist's office but it really is set up for kids. The toddler never seems to mind going (he also doesn't talk so who knows) and when the exam is over the patient gets a token to get a prize from one of the machines. Clearly the highlight of the visit. My only gripe is sometimes we're stuck in the albeit very cool waiting room for a while before we're called in. At least there are things to entertain the toddler.

So NOT a gourmet place but their cheesy hash-brown casserole is worth a trip itself. It's not the kind of place for brunch where you can expect fancy omelets but everything is pretty tasty.

I love, love, love Chevy's.  Their chips and salsa and the best.  The chips are warm and thin and the salsa is fire roasted.  The entrees are tasty as well but I could easily make a full meal out of the chips and salsa.

This is supposed to be a gourmet grocery store and from what I can ascertain, only maybe 25% of what they stock is gourmet and "exotic". I don't expect everything to be but Wheat Thins and Cocoa Puffs? Really?   Whenever I go on a business trip with my husband and I have the day to myself, one of the things I like to do when I'm exploring is to find gourmet markets (I also can't pass a grocery store in Europe without going in). Most recently we were in Santa Clara and I went into one of my favorites, Draeger's in Los Altos, to pick up some lunch. What a difference! They were baking their own croissants and baguettes (compared to selling cakes from the Cheesecake Factory). They even had a chocolate bar - I wouldn't have been surprised to find a bar of Bernachon. Upstairs is a beautiful cooking school. I see places like these and compare it to AJ's and it doesn't even come close. For the most part I feel I can find more "exotic" produce and grocery items and better quality meats at Whole Foods and I really don't want it to be that way. I would love for AJ's to have less of the pedestrian fare and truly stick to being a being a purveyor of fine foods as they purport themselves to be.

There's been more than once I've spotted some adorable toes and asked where they got them done and it was always here, so I thought I had to try to.  This isn't the nicest salon, many of the massage chairs are broken and everything is pretty worn out, they don't do a great job with the pumice or massaging, but the nail art is phenomenal!  The first time I got hot pink toes with argyle and the second time zebra stripes with silver accents.  I've never received so many compliments and they lasted nearly a month.  This is my new go to place for fancy toes.

I finally drank the Apple kool aid and got my first Apple product just the other day.  Seriously.  My first. I don't even have an iPod or a Mac and I'm a graphic designer. It all started when my six year old couldn't keep his hands off my phone. He just couldn't ignore the siren call of Angry Birds and I was constantly missing calls, emails, etc. So my boyfriend, aka baby daddy, suggested I get the sweet pea something he could use other than my phone.  I thought about it and decided on a small tablet for him (best mommy ever).  While setting it up I got such tablet envy and my boyfriend got sick of hearing about it so he suggested I go get an iPad of my own.  You don't have to tell me twice!  In minutes we were in the car and on our way to the Apple store.  I walked into a packed store, newborn in tow, and thought, "crap, what have I gotten myself into" but it was completely painless!  Someone helped me immediately and helped me decide between the iPad 2 and 4 and how many GB I needed (or is it MB?), they helped me set it up, adding my business email to it and within 20 minutes I was out the door with a fully functioning iPad!  Albeit $600 less, but I had my iPad! Alex C was right that they are very nice and helpful here and I'm sure in time, I'll be back for more Apple products.

Kona gets four stars because of their stellar (haven't heard that word in a while, have you) happy hour and for their Las Vegas roll.  I know it's not "real sushi" and all that other crap but I like it for these two reasons and that's enough.   $3 rolls and cheap margaritas make me happy.  (Well that and we have some stock in Kona - kidding!  That doesn't influence my opinion in them at all.)

Nearly everything you could want plus I exchanged some Riedel Scotch glasses that got a scratch on them that we bought at the Sur La Table in San Francisco in the Ferry Building.  We didn't have our receipt and their system didn't work with San Francisco's system, but they agreed the glasses shouldn't have scratch and gave me a new set.  7:30 on a Tuesday night and I decide I need one of those rings that sit on the pie as it bakes so the edge doesn't burn, they have it.  Crisis averted.  Pie is enjoyed by all.

Great happy hour.  We come here on our Tuesday veggies-and-booze night when we pick up our CSA.  I think their happy hour is five items for $6 each until 7:00.  There are also some cocktails and wine.  One of those five items is their burger which you can order rare plus, it comes out perfect this way.  Nice and creamy (instead of dry and chewy), full of flavor and juicy with nice thick pieces of bacon on it.  This might be our new favorite.

I just spent the last week and a half in OC and hit some fabulous consignment shops so I thought maybe I'm missing something here by only going to My Sister's Closet (best one is on Camelback). My friend and I drove all the way up here on a Thursday morning from Ahwatukee hoping to find some gems (and I did my research for which stores are good and which have crap) but even with doing my research, we left empty handed.   Walking in the store this musty, old shoe, dirty smell washes over you. To help spread the aroma around, they have fans blowing everywhere. (A/C? That's so 2008.) The store is packed to the gills but it has no identity. mixed in with 10 year old BCBG are Chico's tops and I even found a sweatshirt printed with flowers and a puppy. The sales person (maybe owner) showed us the jewelery case and said they had a lot of Chanel and Tiffany's but it doesn't take a trained eye to see that many were fakes. I found a small rack of Juicy Couture, but everything was a size small and that ain't for me.   On the upside, there's a great little restaurant next door, the Herb Box and we had a good lunch there so the day wasn't lost.

Best nail art in town and I even get my eyelashes done here!  Not the top quality when it comes the supplies used in the eyelash extensions, but the prices are phenomenal and I get tons of compliments on my lashes which look a lot like a baby camel if that gives you any idea how long and lush they are.  Sarah H and I will be back next week for some fancy toes before Labor Day.

What a waste of a drive and $39. My son's class had a field trip here and he wanted me to come and I figure so long as he wants his mom around, I'm going to be there.   The zoo feels very DIY. In fact, it reminded me of a zoo in Mexico. Very shabby, run down, workers in trucks driving way too fast through the park. They also didn't have many animals. Honestly, 80% of the exhibits were birds, many of which were ducks. I've seen ducks. I don't need to pay $39 to see more.  The petting zoo was ridiculous. The fair has a by far better petting zoo and many areas smelled horrible. I work for the Tempe PD Mounted Unit and I've mucked plenty of stalls and I know exactly what that smell is: no one is digging out the pee spots. They're just letting it sink into the earth. Also, the animals surroundings were alarming. One of the tigers had a log, weeds and an old tire. It is heartbreaking.   Don't waste your money and head to the Phoenix zoo instead. It's also privately owned but they did a much better job.

I was so impressed with this museum. I've been talking about it nonstop and it seems the only people not favoring it are comparing it to the MOMA, National Gallery and the like. That's like when my ex mother in law didn't like Fazoli's because it wasn't authentic Italian food. We're not New York (or DC or any place like that) but for Phoenix, this museum is impressive. Lot's of big artists and my sweet pea and I are big fans of the firefly room, a hi-lite for any four year old.

This place is good for about an hour of entertainment, on a good day.  The hi light was paper airplane making, something we can easily do at home.  My suggestion, spend the $4 more and head to the Children's Museum downtown.  It is better by leaps and bounds.

I've always liked Dos Gringos and it was on our "pub crawl" a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday I just returned.  Funny fact:  You can bring a baby into most any bar in Scottsdale, but Dos Gringos will put up a stink (it was 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon - not even a night-time-party-time - and they said the baby wasn't allowed.  One of the girls we were with hunted down the manager and told him this was America and it was the baby's god given right to be in a bar (yeah, it was hard to keep a straight face).  Long story short, the baby was allowed in.  Once we were in, other kids were already in there too.  If you're going to let any kids in, I would think babies would be your safest bet.  All they care about is breast milk and naps.  They're not going to be sneaking drinks.    Anyway, I love Dos Gringos' Mexican Moonshine, I love that you can sit outside and relax and I've never actually had anything bad here, so four stars it is.

Let me start with saying I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food.  Now don't get me wrong.  I like it OK, it's just not something I crave.  My friend Bev brought me here for lunch one day because we were craving beer and a good salad and it has quickly become a favorite.    Thier chips and salsa are so, so delicious and I'm really picky about chips and salsa.  The chips are nice and thin and arrive hot and the salsa is fresh and just a little bit spicy.  Their margaritas are top notch (my husband always gets the Cadillac) and many claim that their's are the best in the valley.  I don't know if that's true, but they're damn good.  Now my husband is a huge fan of their Pollo a la Queso Crema.  It's a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken, deep fried (like a chimichanga and topped with seasoned cream cheese & melted cheeses.  You'll be my new BFF if you'll go halfsies with me on their topopo salad and mini beef tacos.  So yummy.  The topopo salad salad is a regular green salad tossed with the yuumiest vinaigrette then topped with mixed veggies and then chicken, slices of avacado, pickled jalapeños, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and topped with cottage cheese stuffed tomato.  And the best part:  It's sitting on a tostada covered in a thin layer of guacamole!  I know it doesn't sound that exciting or even that unusal, but it is so damn good.  Like I said, I'm not a big Mexican food addict, but I crave this place all the time.  Thier food is always really good, very fresh and never fails to please.

I stopped by quickly the other day before my dinner at The Herb Box for a quick drink and enjoyed a delicious cherry cocktail that the waitress promised wouldn't taste like a cherry popsicle and she was right. The last time I had been here was for dinner but that was probably seven years ago. A repeat visit is definitely in order. Their cocktails are delicious and ambiance is lively.

We came for Morhers Day brunch yesterday and while the food was good, everyone seemed to enjoy their food, but we had a couple little problems. First, our waitress was completely overworked and most things had to be asked for many times. Not her fault, I think they just didn't plan well in staffing. The second kind if irks me a little. When I sat down, I was last to arrive since I brought one of my little people with me, the waitress said, "We have complimentary mimosas today for all the moms. Can I get you one?"  Well of course!  When I was only half way through she asked if I would like another. Of course I would!  Same with the third and whole they weren't great mimosas, I figure you get what you pay for. Free mimosa = just ok mimosa. Anyway, we get our bill and the first mimosa was free. Each subsequent mimosa wa $8!  I have no problem paying for my mimosas but these were average at best. I left feeling bamboozled.

I enjoyed a delicious meal here on the Yelp Elite night and what a treat!  We started with some delicious apps including shrimp cocktail and pate.  I started my culinary adventure with the wedge salad (I just can't get enough blue cheese) then the prime rib.  Boy was the horseradish spicy and I loved it!  We finished off the perfect meal with good conversation and a creme brulee.  I will definitely be returning soon!

This was the last stop on the pub crawl.  Time for some sustanence (and margaritas) for most of us.  Time to throw up in the pushes for the birthday boy (and for a commercial pilot don't you think he'd have a higher tolerance - aren't they always drinking and whoring around - kidding).  The baby mama and I split some very nice enchiladas and I still maintain that it was the margaritas here that put me over the edge.  Regardless of that useless gibberish, they have nice drinks (big pitchers), good food, and lots of patio seating.  Useless tidbit:  there was a drunk guy in the bathroom with the door wide open taking his sweet time putting his junk away, proudly announcing (to anyone who would listen) that he was proud of what he had.  Dinner and entertainment.

I've been coming here for a couple of years now when my tight shoulders started demanding weekly massages and though Odette is my favorite, I can't say I've had a bad massage here. I've had massages at the Aji Spa, the Camelback and the Mondrian and though those places are much prettier, the quality of the massage is no better and once your eyes are closed, what's the difference?

Back when I was amongst the working class before the housing market crashed and builders still needed interior designers to do their model homes, we ordered a lot of lunches a lot of times (seriously, a lot) from Haji. Really, when you order that often, you can just call it Haji. You're free to take that artistic (or maybe culinary) liberty.  Everything I've had is good but I always lean towards the vegetarian choices and often would get the vegetarian plate (I think that's what it's called) with hummus, baba ganush, dolmas and tabbouleh. My husband loves their rosewater lemonade and often stops here to pick some up after the zen center on Sundays. If you haven't been in here, they're not just a restaurant. They stock all kinds of middle eastern grocery items. I even found some of my favorite Belgium berry and raisin filled biscuit cookies. I bought them all. I haven't seen them outside of Belgium. Belgium and Haji-Baba's. Go figure.

I just had happy hour here with Ada G. and our friend P before Jesus Christ Superstar and happy hour is great!  The bruschetta is the best thing on the menu!  Rustic bread toasted and covered in goat cheese and heirloom tomatoes.  Yummy!  We also ordered onion dip and homemade potato chips and an artichoke dip-both were also good.  I think there might have even been a fourth dish.  I think wine was $2 off a glass for happy hour.  I was here for dinner a few years ago and unlike Ada G, everything was perfect.  I had the loup de mer that night.  I don't remember what my husband or his coworker had but everything was perfect.  I do remember that for the appetizer we had ahi three way and that was really good too.    The best part about House of Tricks is their beautiful outdoor dining.  There aren't many places around with such a nice garden area.  It's a nice treat to be able to eat outside under the trees with the little white lights overhead.

I almost always find something good here.  Today a yoga type wrap top to wear over leggings to pilates, last time a BCBG maxi dress.  Not nearly as high end as My Sister's Closet but definitely on my paper route.

I've ate at Caffe Boa quite a few times and have always enjoyed it (in fact, yesterday's visit was premeditated) but lunch was an experience like no other. My friend and I stopped there for lunch yesterday while we were strolling down Mill doing a little shopping.   We both started with a cocktail as we always do. She had the Anastasia (which she has enjoyed there before) and I ordered the Dark Mandarina. The drinks took forever to come out. At one point we thought our lunches would come out first and I hate it when that happens. At the bottom of both of our glasses were piles of undissolved sugar and my drink, while it tasted OK, but the most unappetizing color. And to add insult to injury, my drink was supposed to be flaming. The waitress tells me my drink was flamed earlier at the bar, "so don't worry". What? Where are my flames? I want my show! You mean it had already peaked?   For lunch we each ordered their lunch combos. I ordered the buttercup lettuce salad and the butternut squash ravioli and my friend ordered the buttercup lettuce salad and the mixed Italian meats panini. Now, I'm not a very big eater (you wouldn't believe it looking at me, but it's generally true) but even I thought I didn't have enough lunch on my plate. On my plate was a half order of salad and three ravioli. Count 'em folks. Three! And they weren't large ravioli, they were three normal sized ravioli and to top it off, my toddler snatched one off my plate right when they set it down on the table so I was immediately down to two. They tasted good, as did the brown butter and toasted hazelnuts but I couldn't get over that I only got three. Three! My friend said her sandwich was average but even though she had the same salad as I did and mine was on the bland side, hers was overly salty. We've ordered this salad before and the lemon vinaigrette has always been plate-licking good.   What's going on here? Where's the old bartender? Where's the salad dressing maker? Where's the ravioli counter? I miss them all and want them back! Oh, I feel all the old abandonment issues bubbling up to the surface again.

The antenna went out on my Lexus RX and Lexus wanted to charge me close to $700 to fix it.  What can a single mom do but buy an after market part off eBay and pay AZ Auto Doctor $80 to install it.  It was even more complicated to replace than they thought, a piece of the old cable had broke off inside, but it was still only $80.  I'm on my third Lexus now and get the majority of the work done here.  As good as Lexus but far, far less.

I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty.

Delicious and worth trying, but build into your evening the waiting time.  I recommend hanging out next door and having a cocktail.  As for the food, the pizza is good, but there is a lot of other good pizza in Phoenix (like LGO) but their sides and salads are phenomenal!

I can't believe I haven't eaten here until now!  I came last Friday night with Sarah H, her husband Dan H and another friend for dinner.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated.  The restaurant was completely packed so service was a little slow, but that happens everywhere on a Friday night.  I was really looking forward to the table side guac, but that was a big disappointment, fortunately our only one.  We had it with everything in it, but our waitress didn't mash up the avocado so it was more like a diced avocado salad than creamy guac, or even close to anything you could scoop up with a chip.  For dinner I had the Pescado del Mar.  A luscious piece of halibut topped with shrimp and scallops.  I could eat this every day.  For desert we tried the churros with goats milk caramel.  If no one was looking, I would have licked the plate.  I tried a bite of the flan and it wasn't so good - cold and flavorless.  I'm looking forward to a return trip and will order the same meal.

This is clearly a love it or hate it place.  You have to be willing to dig, like another Yelper said, this is not for the faint at heart and if you're smart, you'll come at off hours.  With that said, I love you Last Chance.

This was the next stop on the pub crawl.  I enjoyed a Jameson and Coke here.  It was a little off-putting when we were accosted at the door by the waitress with menus, ready to take our order, but she was clearly smarter than us because by the time we found some seats and settled in, the drinks were flowing.

Bar none, the BEST place in Phoenix to get a burger. I took a friend here for lunch today (Ada G.) and we split the Delux Burger (medium rare) and the sweet potato fries and each had a hard cider. I've been telling her how good it is and she's been wanting to see for her self and she wasn't disappointed.   The fries always come out first in their cute little grocery cart and we each get our own dipping sauces (ketchup and some kind of chipotle aioli?). Once we gorged ourselves on those, our burger came (we split, how else can we be expected to keep our girlish figures?) and it was on to the second course. The patty is always the perfect medium rareness. The juice from the meat melds with the Gruyere and blue cheeses and makes the perfect sauce with the caramelized onions. It's topped with arugula and is served on a baguette. When you get this, don't change a thing. It's perfect as it. It would be a travesty to play god and change these beautiful flavors. I love this burger. I could eat another one now. If I could write poetry I would write it a poem, but I can't so I'll just stop now. And maybe plan my next visit.

This place is so damn awesome. First off it's dirt cheap. Sandwiches are about $2.50 to $3.00 a piece and if you want something really good, go for the more exotic ones. My favorite is their meatball which doesn't sound exotic at all but its a fresh french roll filled with Asian style meatballs, pickled vegetables, cilantro and fresh sliced jalapenos. So, so good! It's spicy though but it's one of the yummiest, cheapest things you'll ever eat (and as for the spicy, my toddler eats it so put on your big girl panties and quit complaining).   The next best thing on the menu is their Lee's iced coffee. It's espresso and sweetened condensed milk served over ice. Sounds a little different, but it's heaven in a cup. The sweetened condensed milk balances out the bitterness of the espresso and the hot concoction melts the ice to the perfect viscosity for your libationary enjoyment. Hmmmm. I could go for one now.   You can get this uncommonly delicious meal for about $5. What more could you ever want?

My husband (Tim H.) and I stopped here on our way home from Valentine's Day dinner at Roka Akor for a little dessert. We sat at the bar and while I enjoyed a cappuccino and ordered the tiramisu (one of my favorites) he ordered a port and asked about the butter cake. The bartender (we were seated at the bar) said it was one of their most popular desserts. That still doesn't say if it's good or not but he took a leaf of faith and ordered it. My tiramisu was very average. Trader Joe's frozen tiramisu is much better but the butter cake was so good!  The outside edge was chewy and they inside was gooey. I could go back again and again for it. (I've looked up recipes for it and they all use yellow cake mix. Strange.) I've had some food there and it's hit or miss but that's another story for another time. They've redeemed themselves with their butter cake. Even if you're not a dessert person, you really have to try it when you go there.

Rather than making this another dissertation on every detail of my restaurant experience, I'll try for once to keep it short and sweet. I came here on a Tuesday morning with my friend and my toddler, after a short wait we were seated. We both ordered the bacon and eggs with hash browns. Mine scrambled, hers sunny side up and I also got a pancake on the side for the toddler and me to share (so he wouldn't steal all of my scrambled eggs). The food came pretty quickly and everything was good. My friend said the hash browns were better seasoned last time she was there (they needed a little salt). They were actually made from honest to god, real potatoes, and when was the last time you saw that? I saw in the reviews that they have the best scrambled eggs but I wouldn't go that far. They were good. They also needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper but they were not the best. You have to go to Essence for that. The bacon was nice and thick and delicious and the raisin bread that came with my breakfast delighted my toddler. My pancake was OK. It tasted like a typical good restaurant buttermilk pancake. It did come with warm syrup though and that always makes me happy. Would I come here again? Sure! Would I wait in line on a Saturday for an hour and half? Are you f-ing kidding me?

Breakfast here is always good, that's why there's a wait on weekends. I've enjoyed a couple of different omelets and Ada G. always gets the pig and cow omelet (or something like that, I never remember the name). It's her favorite. I'm a little ticked off still, and it's been about five hours since we left the restaurant, because I feel like we were nickel and dimed and that's one of the things I hate most. Like when you ask you a little extra sour cream and they charge you $2.50 (and you're eating a $5.00 burrito). They didn't do that, but we ordered milk for our kids, she has a four year old and I have the toddler of course. No, I take it back. The waiter specifically asked if we wanted anything to drink for the kids so we ordered some milk for them. The milk he brought came in styrofoam cups with lids. Pretty common if a restaurant doesn't have kids cups and they usually only have one size of styrofoam cups so they bring your drink in those. The kids of course each drank about a third of their gargantuan cups of milk and had enough. When the bill came (and unfortunately after we paid) I noticed that the waiter charged us for large milks. These aren't two lumber jacks. The toddler even still sits in a high chair. Why would either of them need 24 ounces of milk? Deep breathe. Let it go. It just seemed kind of jerky.  The food is good, all the omelets at least, I haven't got past them. If you go on a Saturday morning, beware of a little wait. It is a popular place. If you're not up for a huge meal, the portions are large enough to split. Ada G. and I probably would have but I wasn't in the mood for her snout and hoof omelet. Maybe next time. By the way, the Spanish omelet is great!

This was another stop on our pub crawl and I only had one drink here so I don't have too much to go by for rating, but they had a nice selection and the cider realler hit the spot.  They had a nice big patio outside that accomodated a ton of us and when the birthday boy was ready to leave, the waitress tallied everything up nice and quick.

I like their kitchen supplies downstairs and the toddler and I come here for meatballs and if we can swing it, we drag my husband here for breakfast on the weekends.  I know.  It sounds really weird to have breakfast at Ikea, and it's far from glamorous, but for $1.99 you get a plate of the fluffiest, creamiest scrambled eggs ever (I wish I knew how they did it - and I know how to make damn good eggs), french toast sticks, bacon and hash browns.  The toddler and I each get one and I eat his eggs and he eats my french toast sticks.  The husband eats all of our bacon.  A match made in heaven.  It's pretty damn near hang over food.  If you see us here one morning, you know what we were doing last night.  Who knew Ikea would be a hangover helper?

Nearly every spice you can imagine and you can purchase them in all different quantities. Small jars, large jars, small bags and large bags to refill your jars. Ada G. stole my thunder because I got her hooked on my three favorites. You have to try the Vietnamese cinnamon, the chipotle chile powder and the French vinaigrette mix. Penzey's is great too because every spice in the store is displayed (for lack of a better word) in glass jars so you can smell them before you buy them. Makes a huge difference when deciding between six different cinnamon's.

Oh my god.  We came for happy hour (also years ago for one of yelps best events ever) before a movie and enjoys platters of oysters.  Combined with a few vodka sodas I was very happy and full.  I definitely recommend everyone come and try this great place.

I don't even know how I found this place, but damn it's good. Their sandwiches are phenomenal, once I had the special of the day which was a mashed potato cake with creme fraiche and smoked salmon and that was great and whenever we come for breakfast I always get the French Scrambled Eggs with Toast. They're so creamy and flavorful you'll want to slowly savor them bite by bite. All of the lunch entrees seem to come with a nice side salad so it was enough food for my husband and I to split so we could leave some room for desert.   I noticed on their website that they're now selling their macaroons on-line. A word to the wise, their macaroons are fabulous and terribly addicting so if you can't control yourself (like I sometimes can't), just stay away. The caramel is by far the best flavor and that little tidbit is coming from a hard core chocolate addict. Skip the chocolate and the pumpkin, but the raspberry is very nice also. My husband had a slice of their vanilla bean cake once and enjoyed it. I'm not much of a cake eater (unless it's deep, dark chocolate with no butter cream in sight) so I didn't try it but from the way they fly out the doors, I'd say they must be good.

I first found Lush in London years ago and used to stock up whenever I was in Europe (mail order didn't make any sense to me - you have to be able to smell it first). They have such a wide range of unique bath products, I haven't found anything like them around. I personally haven't tried their hair products but I bought a thickening shampoo (with sea salt in it I think) for a friend picking me up from the airport (before we had one here) and she loved it.   Lush will always have a soft spot with me too because during a trip visiting family in Berlin, my husband and I took off for a week for some R&R in Venice and I frequented Lush a lot. Being pregnant at the time, and Venice not being much of a party town, we spent most of every day wandering around exploring and in the evening we'd be complete hedonists and have an hours long dinner, walk for a while by the canals (many evenings it would rain a bit) then go back to our room and I'd take a long bath with my Lush bubble bath and listen to the rain outside. Heaven on earth.

I've only been here for happy hour, but it was great.  We ordered the sliders on the recommendation of other yelpers and they were delectable.  The ahi roll (and some other roll) were just OK.  Next time I'm just ordering double sliders.  I clearly should have yelped this a while ago while my memory was clearer.  All drinks were half off which was really nice.  I had something with grapefruit and pomegranate (I think) then a glass of wine.  Very nice happy hour.

Ok, let's get this straight right off the bat.  I don't think Starbucks makes the best coffee around, but it's consistant and I really like that.  That was especially important when I used to travel constantly for work.  I knew what I liked and it would be the same no matter where I went.  Anyway, I drove through this Starbucks yesterday morning after dropping my sweet pea at akido because I had been up since 4:00 am and needed a little caffeine and sugar.  I ordered a iced soy mocha, a big treat for me because I'm trying to stay away from refined sugar and animal proteins, and waited my turn to make it around to the little window.  All in all I'd say I was inline for about five minutes.  Nothing unheard of for a Saturday morning.  When I got to the window the girl handed me my drink and said it was on them for the long wait!  That just made my day!  How considerate of them.  The mocha hit the spot and gave me enough energy to run the rest of my errands.  I'll be back for more.

A little gem in a strip mall in Ahwatukee.  They're seriously lacking in ambiance but they have great specialty rolls and fantastic lunch specials.  I like the california, cucumber and tuna roll for $8.50.  It comes with salad (with yummy sesame dressing) and miso soup.  My husband is a huge sushi snob and he'll even come here (though it's not his favorite, but like I said, he's a sushi snob).  Their menu is extensive and has lots of choices for the non sushi lovers like katsu (panko breaded and fried meat) and ramen. There's a little something for everyone.

We love Trader Joe's. In fact, when my husband and I moved from California and we were deciding where to go, my qualifications were that it had to be a place that had a Trader Joe's and the Food Network. Back then in 2001 Ahwatukee didn't have a Trader Joe's and I had to drive to the one on Guadalupe and McClintock, but that was good enough for me, but Trader Joe's must have felt the love, because they came to me.   The toddler and I probably go to Trader Joe's at least three times a week. Me for the odd fruit, cheese or wine, him for the tiny shopping carts and samples. We all have our vices. We seem to know nearly everyone in there now and the toddler gets a balloon every time (of which the cat eats the string off of every night then regurgitates - but that's another story - the fun never ends).   We love you Trader Joe's. We love your tiny shopping carts, your "na-na's", your samples and your balloons. We love everything about you.

What a nice place, and I didn't even know it existed!  Over Fourth of July I babysat Dan H and Sarah H's baby, Ildi, a gorgeous vizsla. Ildi is full of energy and I live in a townhouse and while I have a lovely grassy area out front, she's not to be trusted so it was off to the dog park we went, as often as three times a day.  I threw her ball until her cantor slowed to a trot then back home we went.

It sure isn't authentic Mexican food, but why fool ourselves.  That's not why we're here.  We're here for our nacho fix and some Mexican Moonshine at noon and it always fits the bill.  The food is as it says it is on the menu, the prices are fair and as a bonus to y'all, I went out on a limb and tried the ceviche.  I would definitely order it again.

I'm surprised that I'm the first first to write a review of Dr. Hunt's office considering she was named Top Doc in OB/GYN in 2009 in Phoenix Magazine. Because of that I have to wait a lot longer to get in with her and sometimes the wait in the office is a little long but it's only because she's so good and now so popular.   I found doctor Hunt when I was nearly eight months pregnant with the toddler and couldn't find a single doctor in town who would perform an elective c-section. Switching at the last minute is a little unnerving but I loved her immediately. She takes the time to talk to you and you you don't feel judged, in effect when working with her. Trust me. I got it a lot when I was looking for a doctor.   Most people don't write gory details on yelp (at least not non-food related ones) but here they are (the edited version). On the day I was filleted open like a salmon, Dr. Hunt performed the entire cesarean in about 20 minutes. How many people pushing can say that? (Not that I have anything against pushing.) Also (probably a Scottsdale bonus) she stitched me up plastic surgeon style with all the stitches inside. Beautiful work. (As beautiful as it could be at least.)    I've continued to see her since and I've referred a lot of friends to her. There's a reason she was named the Top Doc and I was apprehensive to even write a review of her because more of y'all will flock to her and it will be even harder to get it but she's worth it. So go ahead. Make your appointments. I'll wait my turn.

I've brought my six year old here since he was a newborn and now the baby comes here too.  Dr Peterson is our favorite, but everyone is so nice and thorough and if either of my boys ever get sick, it seems like they can always fit us in within hours.  If I could change anything, it would only be that they were back in Ahwatukee again.

As a treat for my sweet pea we stopped here on the way to cub scouts last week.  Well, I won't lie.  I was also craving a garden burger.  We got there and the man taking our order was very nice but while there was only one other customer in the restaurant, it took us 18 minutes to get our food.  That's just ridiculous.

Great used bookstore to pick up magazines (lots of current issues), craft books (I'm always trying something new), books for the toddler and kids DVDs (there's a point where the library demands their Disney DVDs back and you have to buy your own to satiate the toddler's appetite).  My only desire is that they were a little closer but c'est la vie!

Five stars solely on the fact that where else can ones toddler run around stark naked through the splash pads at lunch time on a Friday?  Even better were the looks and comments from the passer-byers we got.  We got a good laugh living vicariously through him and he had a ball.  I need to laugh that hard more often.  What else could you ask for?

I ADORE kid's consignment shops.  My sweet pea outgrows clothes constantly and with a new one on the way, it seems we need something weekly.  A decent selection here, not quite as upscale as Love Child, but it is closer to home.  Definitely a place to keep in my rotation.

Here's a little diddy about a girl trying to get some maintenance done on her husband's car and trying to get the best price at the same time (because when you own your own business in this economy, who doesn't need to save a few bucks?).  I started out with our old standby of Scottsdale Infiniti and what they wanted for the maintenance was extortion.  Not only that, they wanted promise of my first born son (sorry, we've already grown attached to him), a herd of camels and a harem of virgins.  Here's the real cincher (not the virgin part, I had them loaded up and ready to go) I had to bring the car in that day - actually that very minute - but I couldn't get a loaner until the next day.  Looked like I would be sleeping there with the camels.  I looked on their website and there weren't any coupons.  The guy there wouldn't even guarantee me a "good" loaner.  I was leaving him an FX.  It's kind of quick and it looks like a shoe so I wanted something else fun to drive but it was a no-go there.  Checking out the other Infiniti dealers in town, I saw that Superstition Springs Infiniti had some great coupons on-line so I gave them call and asked about their "internet only" prices they mentioned on-line.  About $1,000 less and I could use their coupons on top of that!  And I could drop the car off now and he promised me a good loaner!  Shangrila!  Unload the virgins and save them for a sacrifice or when the AC needs repairing, something always comes up, and I was off to Superstition Springs.  It was probably 20 minutes farther but when it was all said and done I saved a lot of money and got a great loaner (We use Chris there) he gave me a G37 and that is fun!    It's more convenient for us to drive to the Scottsdale dealership but with their higher prices and constantly running our of loaners (not to mention the one we had once that smelled like the cross between a pickle an ashtray and feet) I am more than happy to spend an extra few minutes on the freeway for the ease and customer service I get at Superstition Springs Infiniti.

I can't believe I'm the first person to review this place.  They must have been around now for close to three years now and they have decent pizza, dirt cheap!  (And they always have coupons to top it off.)  It all goes back to relative value and I'll use a Taco Bell taco as an example.  For 59 cents, it's a pretty good taco but if you paid $5.00, it wouldn't be as good.  If you're spending $5.00 on a taco, you want it to be phenomenal, but if it's only 59 cents, your standards are lower.  Now at Papa Murphy's you can walk out with a large pepperoni pizza for $6.99 (and when I say large, I really mean large - much bigger than other pizza places larges) and it's nearly as good (if others are a "5", I give it a "4 1/2") but it's only $6.99!  So for it being a good pizza and only being $6.99 it turns into an excellent pizza.  Relative value!  Get it?  You can go now.  School is out.

Twelve, maybe thirteen years have passed and I decided to go back to school. I fortunately landed on SCC for their web design program without even knowing the perks or the quality I was receiving. SCC is one of five (I think that was the number I was told) schools in the country using a Citrix program that allows all students remote access to the software that they need in their coursework. What that meant for me was I didn't need to buy the Adobe Suite, or sit on campus doing homework all the time. This is huge. Trust me.   Secondly I had to take three classes this summer through Rio Salado on-line and I didn't know how good I had it with SCC! SCC is so much more organized, the professors grade your projects sooner and offer feedback not to mention they use Blackboard for on-line classes which while it's not the best, it's functional which really says something.   To anyone out there debating where to sign up for classes, even on-line classes, I urge you to consider Scottsdale Community College. The quality is superior and it even comes with "perks".

I love, love, love Great Harvest.  We've had a love affair of nearly 15 years now, starting in Chico when I was in college.  Once I started working I would pick up a cinnamon swirl and share it with my cube mates if I was in town.  I was thrilled when Great Harvest opened a location in Chandler, not even very far from me.  Their breads are all fantastic and they give you samples.  They would earn five stars if they weren't so expensive, seems like the bread in the California stores is a little cheaper, strange.  They also have great sandwiches.

I liked them a lot until I had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since I was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so I HAD to) on the phone, I wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.  I take a deep breathe, tell him he's right, I'm wrong, how stupid I am.  I must be thinking of my library card.    Why are things so difficult sometimes?

I stopped by this Filibertos after a massage at SWIHA starved to near death (not really, but it felt like it) to get a burrito to eat on my way to hi-lites. I chose an Arizona burrito filled with chicken, rice, sour cream and something else (not beans though which I forgot to add).   At first it had a nice citrusy flavor but pretty quickly it got old and I was tired of eating a lemon burrito. To make matters worse it was full of what we call "funny chicken". You know. those weird pieces that are so chunky and chewy and grisly they're like bits of plastic. I'm used to the Ahwatukee Filiberto's where's there's no "funny chicken" in sight. Once I got to the salon I threw most of it away. I should have stuck with the vegetarian burrito. What was I thinking?

Always amazing pizza for a great deal.  They even opened early for me to pick up my pizza.  They're so accommodating and friendly.

I've been here twice now for the lunch buffet and the second time I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both times it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the buffet, a few salads and many warm entrees to choose from.   I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you won't be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and you'll have fun guessing the spices in the various dishes.   If you're in the mood for some tasty middle eastern food, I would really recommend it. It's a little short on ambiance, but with flavors like that, who's looking anywhere but their plate?

I came here with a friend and the toddler. We all enjoyed the ahi, the sweet potato fries and something else unmemorable, but not bad. Everything was good and as we sat and ate we looked over the menu and thought about what we'd like to have next time. The toddler had a ball running around the grassy hills afterwards playing. We were hoping the produce stand would be open but we were there the wrong time of year. Isn't that always the case? We'll be back Joe.  We'll be back.

I can only attest to their iced coffee, but it was delicious.  The pastries in the case left me drooling and my eight year old begging for one.

I'd give Bertha's a 4.5 if possible. I came here with the toddler and my friend P (I've got to name them, this is just getting confusing calling them all "my friend" - I sound like a creepy priest) after a stop at Eileen where we worked up an appetite trying on clothes. We love splitting things so we figured out our order and she grabbed us a table (it was a Friday at noon so it was more like hunting season than lunch time when it came to finding a table) and I stood in line with the toddler.   I ordered us both the half sandwich and salad combos. One was the salami, pesto and goat cheese sandwich with the goat cheese roasted pepper salad and the other combo was the roast beef and caramelized onion sandwich with the Thai chicken salad. The toddler was in crisis with his Daddy being in San Francisco all week for work and he had taken to random crying jags so I thought a mini red velvet cupcake would help him with his malady.   Both sandwiches were delicious, though I think the salami sandwich edged the roast beef out by a hair because it came on a ciabatta roll and had goat cheese on it. I love goat cheese so much. It could make crap taste delicious. The goat cheese and roasted pepper salad was good, but the Thai peanut chicken salad was PHENOMENAL! The peanut dressing was so nice and spicy. Usually menu descriptions will say the Thai dressing is spicy and it will have a little zip, but this dressing actually was. The chicken on the salad was thinly sliced and moist and tender and it came with lots of roasted peanuts. We were going to see if next time instead of a half sandwich a small salad, we could just do two small salads. There were so many on the menu that looked good.   As for the cupcake, we had one more missing-daddy breakdown but the sugar kicked in and seemed to do the trick. He's a generous little man and gave a lick of the frosting and it was tasty. Next time I'd like to try a treat for myself from the pastry case. Maybe a lemon bar or something like that.   What a treat to find a place that makes everything from scratch and has so many choices. We'll definitely be back and I'm already making my next choices off the menu.

I was so excited when I saw this place opening. We moved here from California so this was yet another thing we left behind. Fortunately all our favorites are slowly following us here. Eventually California will fall into the ocean and we'll have beach front property and we'll be set. I digress.   This BevMo particularly is really well stocked and large. Larger than a lot of California ones and the people here are all really helpful. If they don't have something in stock, they can order it for you and get it in pretty quick. They used to have a great bar in it with wine and beer tastings but it's gone now. Some problem with licensing - I'm assuming liquor license. I can empathize with the bureaucracy. I just filed our quarterly taxes and its driven me to drink - hence BevMo.  Even if you have nothing in particular to buy, take a walk through. It's like Disneyland for adults. Unless you're a Mormon. Then it may not be for you. But if you're not, it's great. (Special bonus - HUGE selection of tiny liquor bottles to stash for lame dry wedding or to keep on hand for general times that require tiny bottles of booze.)

I used to stop here for breakfast burritos on my way to work all the time (the #12 veggie), but now that I'm laid off, no more burritos for me.  I've had most things on their menu, the fish burritos are really good if you eat them right away while the fish is still crisp and as for everything else, it's all good, but my heart belongs to Filibertos.  I like everything here, but I like it better at Filibertos.  Since there isn't one around and if you're near the Original Burrito Company, stop here, you won't be disappointed.

I really don't understand the fascination with Fairytale Brownies.  They are cloyingly sweet, grainy and if they weren't brown you wouldn't know they were chocolate flavored and the flavored ones leave an artificial aftertaste.  We used to receive these as gifts at the office from vendors and this was always one snack to skip.

So happy to have not only frozen yogurt in Ahwatukee, but relatively healthy frozen yogurt at that.  The toddler and I come here often and he always lets me pick the flavor (such a gentleman).  I've been to other locations in California and those seem to have eight flavors and ours always has twelve so that's a big plus.  My favorite is pumpkin, they should have it year round, but I've never had a bad flavor.  My dream flavor though would be a tart yogurt, kind of like Pink Berry or MoJo's.  Maybe I'll right them a letter.

Though I have eaten here quite a few times and always enjoyed it, my husband and I tried something new on Saturday. We attended their first cooking class. For $60 per person and about three hours of our time, we were provided with cocktails, sake, shochu and tea along with snacks and samples of everything we grilled as it was a robata class. We enjoyed lamb chops, black cod, teriyaki salmon, a fish grilled whole, chicken skewers with young leek and a phenomenal steak. I think we all left with full stomachs and smiles on our faces.   After the class I asked one of the instructors, Bjorn (who is also the head chef there), how best to prepare scallops and he was kind enough to take me back and show me how. I'm ready now to grill my own at home.   The food here is always top notch, everyone working here is helpful and personable and every experience is noteworthy and memorable. Roka says they are considering having more cooking classes in the future so keep your eye out for those if you're interested. It will definitely make for a fun and unique afternoon.

My husband and I came for the Sushi Master class on Saturday afternoon and left not only knowledgeable, but fat and happy. Class started with mojitos and continued with sake and Japanese beer as we snacked on edamame and calamari and we learned about fileting fish, different types of sushi and sashimi and eventually made our own. We prepared our own butterfish tetaki and California rolls and were served various other sushi and sashimi prepared by the chefs throughout the afternoon. When taking this class DO NOT plan on making dinner plans after because you will be to stuffed to move, let alone eat anything else. Not only is the class a great value for the money but it's a lot of fun and you really learn something new and unique. Roka Akor, you've done it again.

I am a total Whole Foods junkie and I need to get my fix at least once a week.  Sometimes I just go in for a spin around the store and some sample, but I always comes out with something new to try.  I'm also horribly addicted to their eggless tofu salad and Beyond Chicken buffalo strips.  You will never find my fridge without either of these items.  This Whole Foods is also a really nice place for a glass of wine and some nibbles.  Years ago when they opened they had a $10 deal on Saturday evenings for three tastings of wine paired with three small dishes.  I wish they would bring that back.

Ada G. and I come here often and she's right on about the salads and the soup. I don't know why we still always order a salad (maybe someday we'll learn), but their margaritas are great, their nachos are awesome and I love their salsa - it's really fresh tasting. So fresh tasting ion fact, I once caught the toddler drinking it straight from the bowl, but hey, it's a vegetable, right?   I have no idea how their "real food" is but their happy hour fare is delicious and cheap and that's all I ask.

I was craving something ethnic so my friend and I tried this place out for lunch.  Lot's of choices on the buffet, more than the typical Indian buffet, plus three kinds of desserts, mango lassi and garlic naan.  All this for only $8.95.  We will be back without a doubt.

P and I came here for dinner a couple of Fridays ago hoping for something along the lines of Le Grande Orange/Postino, but in Tempe (at least their menu looked that way). We started with some wine and she had a an OK cocktail (it had a fancy name but was really just orange juice and vodka) while we perused the menu. We finally decided on some bruschetta, a chopped salad and a pizza.   The bruschetta came out first, two fig and prosciutto, a spinach, blue cheese and onion and a smoked salmon with capers and chef's tartar. They were all just OK. The bread was average, the toppings were skimpy (even the red onions on the spinach bruschetta) and they were poorly seasoned. The salad also needed some salt and pepper, at least that's what we had to offer it table-side. At that point our waitress came by and asked if she could get us anything else or if we just wanted to stick with the apps. I wasn't sure if this was a trick question or not because was she considering our pizza an appetizer? No. She forgot, admitted it, then asked us if we wanted it. Yes. Yes, we want our pizza.   Our sicily pizza came pretty quick and smelled great. It was topped with Schreiner's "sicilian" sausage, sundried tomatoes, parmesan and goat cheese, shallots and herbs. We dug right in but again, someone in the back doesn't believe in seasoning. We ate what we could and left the rest there.   It's a shame because La Bocca has such a nice ambiance and their menu looks so promising. Maybe I'll try them again sometime in the fall when it's cool enough to sit on the patio, for now I'll stick with what tastes good.

Well, their happy hour ends at 6:00 but it is a pretty good happy hour.  Half off some of their cocktails, wine and what not and half of some rolls and other apps.  What gets me is the wasabi is actually blue.  Yes, that's the name and all but do we really need to be so contrived as to actually load up the patrons with Blue No. 1 and 2 (maybe a touch of Green No. 3)?  That just grossed me out to no end.  The intensity of the color still disturbs me.  Their second strike is the name of their rolls.  Really, I want something presented to me as the "Dirty Sanchez" and the "Me Soy Horney"?  They all tasted fine but the names alone did them in.  We won't be back.  I had been to the location in North Scottsdale probably four years ago but it was after wine tasting and we were all wasted so maybe that's the key to a good meal here.  Complete obliteration.

I met a friend here for brunch on Sunday and I'm still telling everyone I know about Cork.  The cashier at the grocery store, check.  The mailman, check.  The toddler's teachers, check.  I swear I must have drank the kool aid because I have to spread the word.    First of all complimentary mimosas and bellinis.  Decent ones too at that.  Combine that with a tasty breakfast sandwich for my friend (she decided on it before we even got there) and I settled on the special of the day, a green chili pork tostada.   While her sandwich looked good, I only had eyes for my own.  Three layers of fresh, fried corn tortillas layered with green chili pork, refried beans, fresh salsa, cheese and topped with creamy scrambled eggs.  I swear I could have started thumping my foot on the ground the way a dog does when you rub their stomach just right.  It was that good.  Really.  We were first to arrive at 10:00 am and left well after 1:00.  We never felt rushed or that we were being pushed out.  In fact, the entire time we sat and talked, our waiter kept coming by and topping off our champagne.  Why can't more restaurants expect people to sit around and talk for a while?  In a sense, it was more like a meal in a European restaurant that we could take as long as we wanted.  No one was constantly opening the bill and asking if we wanted change.  We were just left in peace.  I plan on working Cork into my restaurant repertoire.  The quality, customer service and price aren't often seen together.  It's probably a little out of the way (it is for me) but it is truly worth it.

My sweet pea requests to come here often.  Sushi is average, but kids and adults alike seem to love the conveyer belt.  Also, a huge perk, no matter how much we eat, the bill always seems to come to only $12. Can't beat that.

I absolutely love the Farm.  It's a great place to bring out of town guests and always nice just to walk around on a day you don't have much else going on and enjoy the gardens and a yummy treat. I had plans to meet a friend for lunch here yesterday but she had to cancel and I thought why should I miss out, so I packed up the baby and we went ourselves. I had a delicious roasted vegetable and portobello sandwich which only could have been better if the veggies and mushrooms were warm.  After my sandwich we walked around and looked and the chickens, what was growing in the gardens and enjoyed some of the raspberry bar I bought with lunch. What a perfect lunch.

I've heard a lot about Sweet Republic but living in Ahwatukee, I haven't made it up there so I was so happy to see a Sweet Republic ice cream bus at Phoenix Friday Nights. My husband and I hurried over to get a couple of cones. They had probably five different flavors on the menu and I was flabbergasted to see salted caramel flavor which is my favorite of all time. Normally I just have to make it myself since I haven't had a good one outside of San Diego (Haagen Daaz is pretty good too for not having to make it yourself).   My husband and I both sampled the bacon (bacon bits in a sweet cream base) and I tried the salted caramel (caramel swirls and sea salt in a vanilla base) and my husband also tried the malt ball. I ended up getting the salted caramel and my husband went with the malt ball and we both wished we would have gone with the bacon. Both of our flavors after a few bites tasted very ordinary. My sample had a nice salty taste but my entire scoop tasted only of vanilla. (When I make my caramel ice cream I take all the sugar in the recipe and caramelize it until it's a dark golden color. It gives the ice cream a great flavor and color.) My husband's scoop had nice big chunks of malt balls in it and the vanilla ice cream was fine but with all this anticipation, we really expected something more. The bacon only came in a sweet cream base which I normally don't care for (because for the most part it tastes like nothing - kind of what it's meant to do), but at least that flavor had a personality.   I looked on-line at their website and the next time I'm in north Scottsdale I'll stop by because their sorbets and frozen yogurts (mango lassi! I've already looked up a recipe) look really good. This visit left me disappointed but still curious about their other flavors.

My husband and I came back after a little dinner at Roka and I stuck with the sorbets and yogurts per my plan and I wasn't disappointed this time. I tried a lot of flavors but ultimately decided on the Grapefruit Strawberry Mint Sorbet (maybe it was called Mojito - it definitely had grapefruit in it though) and a scoop of the Desert Honey Nonfat Yogurt.   Both flavors were delicious and Sweet Republic totally redeemed themselves. I tried their Mango Lassi while we were there and they inspired me to make my own this weekend. I added a pinch of cardamom and some rose water to mine. So good. I love it when a restaurant inspires you. I will definitely be back to Sweet Republic. There are more flavors that they rotate in that I have on my wish list to try.

I came here last night with some friends for their Sunday Supper and had an (of course) fantastic meal. Can anyone say something bad about NOCA?   We started with cocktails, I had the JR's Ripper. Citron vodka, Pama liqueur, fresh squeezed grapefruit and jalapeño essence. It was spicy and sweet and I couldn't stop drinking it. My fellow table mates enjoyed Bangkok Hangover and a Cucumber Gin drink I can't remember the name of anymore. I did of course sample them all and would have been more than happy helping anyone finish theirs, but they never asked.   Three out of the four of us ordered the Bacon & Egg, Berkshire pork belly, crispy poached egg, marinated tomatoes, pesto aioli and country bread. Three words: Plate lickin' good. The off man out ordered the gazpacho with roasted Marcona almonds. She was afraid of the Bacon and Egg because of the runny yolk (I can sympathize, I too have egg issues), but I gave her a bite and she loved it and wished she had ordered it too.   For the main we all ordered the Steak Frites. Prime skirt steak, melted leeks, red wine jus, pommes frites and smoked paprika aioli. Not very adventurous I'll admit, but it came out nice and rare (don't you hate it when you order a rare steak and it comes out medium?) and the fries were crispy. Truthfully, I think the last time I had Steak Frites was in Paris and this one was better (not taking the scenery into account).   Desert was a Poppycock Sundae with popcorn gelato (tasted like vanilla), caramel (I can make better), chocolate (there wasn't any in my cup), nuts and caramel corn. It was good, I polished it off but it reminded me of the salted caramel sundae at Postino (with the chocolate covered corn nuts) and that thing makes your toes curl.   All in all it was a fantastic night. The wine pairings were good, food was delicious, the restaurant has a good ambiance and we all left full and happy.

We all came here for restaurant week and not only was everything delicious, the were tolerant of us playing Cards Against Humanity even.  We're classy like that,  I started with the Panna Cotta of Creme Fraiche with Christopher's Smoked Salmon and Duncan Farms Greens.  Phenomenal!  I love smoked salmon and can never turn it down, but the panda cotta made it even better if that's even possible!  Next I had the Mousse of Scallops with Lobster Sauce.  This one tasted great but the texture was a little strange.  I think I would have preferred seared scallops rather than a scallop mousse but that wasn't my choice tonight and I love scallops as much as smoked salmon.  Lastly, I had the Sole Meunière.  Wow!  Not only was it delicious, it was a huge portion.  Sarah H ended up taking some of hers home with her. A few people at the table ordered desert and I think I had at least one bite of everything.  What a sweet way to end the meal.  I understand the Christopher's has a wine dinner once a month and I'm looking forward to trying one of those next time.

We've been participating in Desert Roots CSA for well over a year now and everything good I have to say about them wouldn't be enough.  Like Christy L. said, a 1/2 share (which is HUGE) comes to about $18 a week.  Last week there were heirloom radishes, turnips, spinach, broccoli raab, baby bok choy, a head of green leaf lettuce and some oranges (and I'm probably forgetting something).    Unlike Bountiful Baskets, Desert Roots is 100% local and everything is grown without the use of pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.  It isn't certified organic (this costs thousands of dollars and takes years) but I care more about what is on my food rather than an official seal.  Bountiful Baskets produce comes from all over so it doesn't support local farmers.  Without our support they're often forced to sell their farms and up come more subdivisions.  Additionally by buying local everything is picked within 24 hours of receipt and also, the money then is kept in the community.  These reasons are just the tip of the ice berg.    Desert Roots Farm CSA goes in seasons lasting any where from about 6 to 10 weeks (approximately).  There are drop off locations all over the valley.  Ours in Ahwatukee comes on Tuesdays.  We pick up our bags at a local shop between 4:00 and 7:00 pm then go to happy hour (thus dubbing the night 'veggies and booze').  The variety is nice and you will definitely be eating your veggies every week!

I am completely in love with their herb bread.  It's a tasty sourdough loaf filled with fresh herbs, but not so "herby" it can't handle sweet applications.  It's great toasted and topped with cranberry goat cheese.  At $8 a loaf I don't buy it often, but it is a favorite treat.

We were trying to figure out a place for Sunday brunch, and I drove past Cafe Monarch on my way to Arcadia Farms once (such a disappointment) and thought it would be fun to try sometime after seeing its stellar reviews on yelp. When we were figuring out a place, I suggested we come here and it was nothing short of phenomenal.   Between the six of us we had five bottles of champagne, so we settled on the patio for a leisurely lunch. Once we were set up with a giant bucket of ice Christopher, the chef/owner/server/everything-in-one, came over and went over the menu of the day. Our choices were a cold salmon poached in jasmine tea with a cucumber salad served on a bed on red wheat salad (my choice), a baked french toast with a Merlot sauce or a strata with spinach, cheese and bacon. I had the salmon and there were two orders of french toast and three of the strata.   It took quite a while for our food to arrive, but who cares when you have good conversation, delicious wine and a beautiful patio to enjoy. (Not to mention the intoxicating aromas wafting from the kitchen.) When our food came, not only were we each awarded with our meals, but he brought us a PLATTER OF BACON. Seriously! He said it was for the french toast (we only had two orders) but there must have been close to two pounds there.   On to the food because really, that's why we came. My salmon was the perfect cool temperature (I hate it when it's ice cold) and there were two large pieces. So large that one would have been enough, but I would never complain. The cucumber salad was cut into long, julienned strips and complimented with a touch of dill. The red wheat salad was perfectly chewy and nutty (why don't more places serve grain salads?) and combined with grapes and heirloom baby tomatoes. The french toast casserole was sitting in a sweet Merlot sauce (and also maybe a vanilla sauce of some sort) and was garnished with fresh berries. The top was brown and crispy and the inside was tender, sweet and creamy. It was akin to best bread pudding you've ever had, only lighter and creamier. The strata was filled with fresh spinach and cheese and made from ciabatta. Like the french toast it was tender and creamy inside and it was hard to stop stealing bites off of my friend's plate. I would a been thrilled with any of the three breakfast selections that morning. Each was superb and two of the six of us were professional chefs and neither of them could find fault in anything. We licked our plates clean and couldn't stop talking about the food.   A complimentary dessert was brought out of a platter of fresh strawberries dusted in powdered sugar and citrus zest, served with a bowl of chocolate ganache. I was the perfect light finish to our meal on a warm spring day.   This really is my new favorite restaurant. The only thing I can say is don't come here if you want a quick meal, but why would you ever want to rush something like this. Coming here is an experience, not a quick bite and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Another dinner to leave me slouched back in my chair with my hand on my belly, a stupid grin on my face and a contented sigh on my lips.  I brought Ada G., Elaine B. (formally known as P - I kind of like her "formally known as P) and B here for dinner on Thursday night as I've been talking about it for so long, they wanted to know what all the hubbub was about since I couldn't stop talking about the roll-your-eyes-back-in-your-head brunch I had here last Spring so we finally made reservations and off we went.  When you make reservations at Cafe Monarch, you want to let Christopher know if you have any food aversions or allergies, or maybe even if you're really counting on something in particular that night so he can plan in advance.  He shops for the freshest produce and selections for the night are restricted.  That being said, I wish more places did it this way.  It's tiring to flip through pages and pages of menus of nearly identical items.  I'd just as soon be told the chef bought the freshest items possible that day and this is what inspired him or her and this is what will be served tonight.  Will this suffice?  Why yes, yes it does!  Thank you.  Do you understand my point?  We brought along a couple of bottle of champagne and a white and red.  It's all BYO here and we figured we'd hedge our bets not knowing what we'd be in the mood for.  (By the way, it's also cash or check also - no credit cards) We started with some champagne and Christopher told us for dinner he had in mind a penne pasta with a pumpkin cream sauce, toasted walnuts and sliced Gorgonzola on top.   For the next course we would have a warm salad of fresh artichokes, olives and peppers and for the main course was a beer braised chicken.  All of it sounded fabulous to us, of course none of are picky eaters.  Isn't it just more fun to dine with good eaters?  Pretty much anything he would have made, we would have ate.  No food aversions at our table!  (Innards.  I take that back.  I don't like innards.)  We enjoyed our champagne while he worked on the pasta.  The smells coming from the kitchen were just intoxicating.  The restaurant itself is so cozy too.  We sat inside this time and the best I can describe it is a cross between a French bistro and Buca di Beppo.  OK.  Total disservice to Cafe Monarch but he has the coolest things all over his walls like Buca di Beppo does.  As for the rest, I could swear I was back in a cafe in Paris.  Our pasta came out heaped on a platter family style.  The sauce was a lovely pale pumpkin hue accented with fresh herbs and lovely, pungent slices of Gorgonzola and crunchy walnuts it was pitch perfect.  We all ate as much as we dared while Christopher came and entertained us with his stories.  In most restaurants when the owner or manager comes by to see if everything is OK that's all fine and dandy but you usually don't want them hanging around spouting their propaganda, but with Chris it's the complete opposite.  You don't want him to go!  You wish you could eat with him every night.  He told us about growing up, what he did last summer, he joked around with us girls, commented on Ada G's. cowgirl sheik attire (I'll let her go into that) and even explained to me exactly how he made a couple of the dishes.  The warm salad served next came in a small, cast iron skillet.  Baby sliced artichokes were sautéed with capers, sweet Italian peppers, heirloom tomatoes and thyme.  It was light, flavorful and a welcome departure to the typical green salad I've been eating all summer.  Our final course was fit for a small village.  A platter of chicken pieces all beautifully browned and braised in Full Sail Ale.  The braising sauce was exquisite spooned over the spicy chicken meat.  The cute, little, pregnant one of us who claims she can't eat much anymore even ate two pieces of the chicken.  You've got to love Christopher, he boxed up all of the leftover pasta and chicken for us into individual boxes.  Right when we thought the best was over he brings over a couple of slices of pumpkin cheesecake with walnut brittle.  I like cheesecake but it's usually something I wouldn't order because it's so heavy but not this one!  Light and creamy, like a baked pumpkin cheesecake chiffon.  The perfect sweet ending to a beautiful meal.  Though I want everyone out there to go to Cafe Monarch because I think it's one of the best restaurants around, I don't think it's for everyone.  Of course you can tell him your allergies and aversions when you call to make reservations and allergies can't be helped of course and who doesn't have an aversion to something or other but meals like this are best when you leave it in the chef's hands.  Relinquish the control you think you need and let him decide what to prepare for you and I guarantee that you too will be slouched back in your chair rubbing your full belly and a contented sigh on your lips.

A big group came on my birthday and while I was thinking there was no way it could be as good without Christopher, I was wrong.  I will without a doubt be back for more.

Go! Go Quickly! We went last night for Yelp Easts and EVERYTHING practically is on the Yelps Eats menu.   My husband and I both started out with the onion tart, my friend had the escargot and her husband had the pate. The tart was fabulous and huge (perfect size for a light lunch). The escargot were a bit of a disappointment. Nothing bad but not as good as she hoped. The pate appetizer came as two slices rather than just one, a very generous portion. We all tried it and it was good (and it's made in-house).   For our entree my friend and I each ordered the scallops, my husband ordered the duck and my friend's husband got the steak frites. The scallops were phenomenal. They came on a bed of house made organic creamed corn. Delicious to the last bite. My husband loved his duck. It was pounded thin and panko crusted and served on a bed of horseradish spaetzle. Granted, he loves anything panko crusted, but he did say the duck was good. I had a bite, but the panko crust turned me off (I dislike anything panko crusted). The steak frites was a huge portion and so delicious and bloody.   For dessert we each ordered something different. I had the macaroon, my husband got the blueberry tart, my friend ordered the beignets and her husband ordered the sticky toffee pudding. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their desserts. Mine (the macaroons) came layered with two different kinds of mousses - dark chocolate and maybe caramel. It got a little too sweet towards the end, but it's dessert. Par for the course. The beignets came a huge pile of them with three sauces (one of them nutella!).   I will definitely come back here again and I'd like to try breakfast here too. The food was great and the atmosphere near perfect (they need to ditch the TVs - they really don't belong there). Our next Yelp Eats meal at Digestif has a lot to measure up to now.

I came here with my friend, P, for her birthday lunch. We were both excited to try it and had heard good. I had tried a couple of bites from them at corks and forks and nothing tasted great but cooking for a bunch of people at a festival like that can be difficult so I chalked that up to a fluke, skipped breakfast and came prepared wearing my eating pants.   We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated then got a nice table towards the back where we could watch the beautiful Scottsdale/Arcadia moms lunch behind the glass. Why they were behind glass in their own separate room, I don't know.   What seemed to be the most promising part of the meal was the delicious juice concoctions on the menu THAT YOU CAN ADD VODKA TO!!! That's my dream. Why can't you do this everywhere? P ordered the Ginger Nojito and I got the New Dew. Our beautiful spiked drinks arrived in tall, pretty glasses and while P's was quite good, mine tasted like a tea made from old sweaty gym socks. I was pretty sure at this point it was just me because everything here is supposed to be really good so she tried it to and yup, gym socks. Once we got the waiter back we explained my drink's disgusting nature and while I wanted a little sympathy, he seemed to just think I didn't like it. Surely this wasn't the way it's meant to be served. It tasted nothing like honeydew, mint or limes. I went with what P had at that point because it was safe (I hate having to do that) and we decided to order.   We started with the Caramelized Onion Tart with Figs and Gorgonzola, added on the Edamame Dumplings at the recommendation of our waiter and rounded out our meal with Curry with Rice Noodle, Cauliflower, Cashews and Chicken. Everything came out pretty much at once but we started on the tart. It was near paper thin with the onions and figs a sweet contrast against the salty, skunky Gorgonzola. I could have eaten four of the them. Anybody who goes here, order this tart. It is so delicious, probably the best thing on the menu. The edamame dumplings proved to be bland, mush filled dough balls sitting in a pool of broth. They didn't taste particularly bad, just bland but that filling was so mushy inside. We couldn't get over the texture and textures don't normally bother me. Finally, our entree. It unfortunately was not much better than the dumplings. Cauliflower was described in the title but it only came with a few pieces. The sauce had a little bite but was still on the bland side at the same time. Does that make sense? It was spicy-ish, but without flavor. It tasted like a high quality TV dinner.   My husband went for a business lunch a couple weeks later and I told him to order the onion tart. He had pretty much the same experience. The tart was the best thing they ordered. We truly must be missing something because it seems that most people love this place. I won't be coming back unless it's a business dinner and I have no choice in the matter, but what could I say then.

I went stand up paddle boarding here yesterday with Sarah H, a class through the city of Tempe, and we had a ball.  I was a little worried at first but it turned out to be pretty easy and a lot of fun.  Just being in the marina with the smell of the water and the sail boats everywhere reminded me of San Diego.  I never realized a piece of home was so close!

Sarah A and I came here during restaurant week and enjoyed a fantastic meal.  We both got different dishes for each course which was nice because we could sample each others.  I even got a succulent salad which was crunchy and refreshing.  I'll be back with Alex C.

I'm with Ada G.  This is a fantastic place, mostly to get takeout or delivery from rather than eating at (the ambiance is lacking a little (but you can't have everything), but the food is always great.  Everything we've eaten here has been good and a few times we've been so lazy or (drank a little too much to drive over there), called in our order and they said they would be over in 30 to 40 minutes.  The doorbell rings 10 minutes later and we wonder who it could be.  Surely not our Chinese food.  How could they even make it that fast let alone drive it over?  But low-and-behold, it is.  Fantastic.

I stopped here for yogurt on Thursday afternoon and again yesterday evening for their free yogurt night to celebrate their grand opening. Their flavors are delicious, they have a huge variety of flavors many with cute tongue in cheek names (probably 10 or so) and a gamut of toppings, at least half of which are fresh fruit. When I heard that they'd be giving away free yogurt on Friday, I had to drag my husband back.   My favorite of all flavors is the tart pomegranate. It tastes almost identical to something you'd get at Pinkberry. I was telling my husband how good it was when we were waiting in line and he said it didn't sound like something he would like but when he tried it, he had to admit that it was delicious. Both days I had the pomegranate yogurt with fresh pomegranate seeds, blackberries, kiwi and mochi as toppings. Heavenly! And where else do you find fresh pomegranate seeds?   As for the naysayers that complain there are only one size of cups, well clearly you were there on the free yogurt grand opening night. Normally there are more than one size. As for those that complain that self serve bars lead to a life of gluttony and obesity, for God's sake, control yourself. Stay home and drink your Diet Coke and save the yogurt for us.

Love 'em. Like you wouldn't go to a fine Mexican restaurant and order nachos, you wouldn't come here and expect a gourmet meal. We come here when we want to gorge ourselves on burritos, nachos, rolled tacos with guacamole (a perennial favorite) and beans (a favorite of the toddler and mine). Their breakfast burritos are great (and HUGE) and everything else is equally delicious. My husband loves the pina (a pineapple flavored drink - I think I'd like it with vodka) and the prices here are fair and best yet, they have a drive through window. I'm in love.

Yet again.  Same order (Arizona Burrito and three Rolled Tacos with Guacamole), same deliciousness.  How can you do this to me for $6.31?  It's just not right!  I'm going to get fat.  Delicious food shouldn't be this cheap and come from a drive through window.  I don't even have to pull the toddler out of his car seat.  10 minutes round trip and I'm on the couch, beer in one hand, burrito in the other Real Housewives of New Jersey on TV.  It doesn't get any better than this.

We've had our carpet cleaned by them since we've moved here from California in 2001.  They changed their name and it's Quality Floor Care (I think).  They always do an awesome job and are very meticulous and go over twice on all the traffic areas (really, they do!).  They even throw in a little bonus each time like scotch guarding an extra area for free.  I've recommended them to friends and they've all been pleased also.

It's been a while since we ate here (but we're going back again tomorrow). I think we had the Gazpacho, a Desert Sweet Shrimp Pasta dish and something with butternut squash and gnocchi. The Gazpacho badly needed salt, the shrimp pasta was a little on the bland side (just a little) but the butternut squash dish was phenomenal! We thought it was strange at first that you walk around and look at the food then walk up to the register to order, but it turned out OK because it's kind of nice to see what your food will look like when it comes out.   The interior of the restaurant is beautiful too. Lots of bamboo paneling and everything is supposed to be sustainable. A side note: they don't have high chairs or boosters (a big problem for college students, I know, so if you have a little one, bring your own booster seat if you need one).  Most people won't have this problem but I travel with a two year old.  That's just how I roll.

I came here from brunch yesterday with Sarah H and was delightfully surprised.  I knew it wouldn't be as good as Talking Stick, but it comes close.  (And it's cheaper!)  I enjoyed more than my fair share of shrimp cocktail, an omelet filled with crab, a couple slices of prime rib, chicken with mole, poached salmon and then there were desserts...  Lemon cake, chocolate covered strawberries, pumpkin cheesecake and sugar cookies.  All this for only $20!

My friends and I were happy to see something go in after 56 East closed and we were hoping that it would prove to be another great place for happy hour. Sadly, not so.   Their happy hour is only OK. Just dollars off of drinks and apps, not half price. They didn't have a cocktail list in their menu (and they've been open for a while now), just a blank page. Our waiter said they were working on a list of their own cocktails, eluding they would be original so I asked him to name some. A cosmo, a lemon drop, a traditional martini or something with peach schnapps. Sounded like the same old tired drinks we've seen everywhere so I went with a glass of wine, Ada G. got a sangria (the only "unusual" drink they offered) and our other friend went for the "exotic" cosmo.   Our drinks came and the sangria was OK but the cosmo tasted like watered down cranberry juice. We all had to try it just to make sure and low and behold, watered down cranberry juice. Not even a whisper of alcohol in it. She ended up sending it back and getting a glass of wine also, can't screw that up.   Our food came and best looking award goes to their mini hot dogs that Ada G. ordered for her little girl. They were honest to god tiny hot dogs in tiny buns. Not cut down to size or anything but actually made that way. Adorable. For us hungry girls we ordered the chicken tamale appetizer, hummus and ceviche. The tamale was a kind of deconstructed dish of little triangle polenta cakes with shredded chicken and tomatillo sauce on them. It seemed that we all enjoyed them. They were nothing phenomenal, but if I were forced to come back here, this might be something I would order. The ceviche was great, except that it came with water crackers. I personally prefer it with tortilla chips but at least the traditional saltines would have been better. Now the hummus. It came in three flavors. One was roasted red pepper which tasted kind of weird, there was a spicy one we all liked and another flavor that tasted off which we skipped but the worst part was that the hummus was runny like they thinned it out to make it go farther. It had to be served in bowls so it wouldn't run all over the plate. It was so runny in fact that it could be used for salad dressing (though based on the taste, you probably wouldn't want to). And again with the damn water crackers! We got a few wedges of pita and a dozen water crackers. Did they buy them in bulk?   I think what finally chased us out the door was that they had their roll up window at the bar open to the patio and it was 108 outside and humid. No one was sitting on the patio. In fact the bar wasn't even full but with the window open the A/C couldn't compete with the heat and it was stifling in there. We couldn't understand why they wouldn't wait to open it until someone wanted to sit out there.   Sadly, this will have been my first and last visit to Fired Up Grill. They followed in 56 East's footsteps and with such a great happy hour, it was too tough an act for them to follow.

I saw another frozen yogurt shop opening here in Ahwatukee (why were there so few for a while? California has so many and Arizona has so few - makes no sense) and I was hoping they would have tart yogurt like Pink Berry, or at least like MoJo's and lucky me, they did!   I looked on-line before they opened and saw they had a twitter account and on that it said for their grand opening weekend yogurt was buy-one-get-one half off so we all went in on a Saturday afternoon looking for just that.   They place is very small, but decorated well with green tile and all the yogurt machines are in the walls. Unlike MoJo's, when you come in the door and do it all your self here the yogurt girls want to serve you the samples themselves (for all I know, maybe even the yogurt). We asked about the BOGO and the girl had no idea about so she went to ask her manager. She came out and said the manager would only do it with the coupon so I had to explain that twitter doesn't come with a coupon and their tweet said nothing about a coupon.  So she had to go back to get the manager to intervene.  (Check out their tweet on August 16 at 4:02 pm http://twitter.com/ZwirlYogurt) She argued with me for a while and I understood where she was coming from, she obviously wasn't in charge of the twitter account, but come on. You need to be aware of what's going on with your business. She conceded and said that she could do it for us and to let us know when we were ready and she would personally ring us up.   At that point we had sampled a couple of flavors here and there waiting for answers and we weren't too impressed. The original tart was bland. I know that's what you would expect, but it's not bland at MoJo's or Pink Berry's. Kind of like the difference of fat free ice cream compared to the real thing (only this is all fat free). I also tried the tart pomegranate and that also tasted like it was missing something. My husband tried a couple too and that alone seemed to satisfy him. I just took a lick off my sample cups and gave the rest to the toddler so he was in heaven so after all that we decided the yogurt just wasn't worth it BOGO or not and we left. Sadly we won't be back. We'll stick with Golden Spoon and when I'm lucky to be close enough to MoJo's, I'll get my fix there. That being said, I hope they do well, I don't want to see any businesses fail.

I came here for the first time ever today to pick up a couple of cake pops as a surprise for my sweet pea.  While they had lots of cupcakes to choose from (no flavors really caught my eye), there were only four choices of cake pops.  One was mint, which I don't care for in deserts, and the others were brownie, cotton candy and a coconut which I got for myself.  All the cake pops had very thin coatings which cracked and flaked off before I even got them home.  The coconut had a nice moist center, very sweet (but that's the nature of a cake pop) and a sprinkling of coconut on the outside.  The brownie was gummy and overly dense and the cotton candy flavor was just disgusting.    Though Mind Over Batter is close by, I don't think we'll be trying them again.  Our search for a good cake pop continues.

I came here with a friend after seeing the write-up in the Arizona Republic and boy was she getting a lot of foot traffic!  This is a great little boutique with a lot of cute, casual clothes all on the afordable side and she also has tons of accessories.  We will definitely be putting her shop on our rotation!

Ada G. took me here before we saw Chelsea Handler so we could get appropriately lubed up (thank you Dr. Funks) and the food is awesome. They have the best poke in town and we shared one of their fish (fishes?) too with the lemongrass coating and it was equally delicious. Their patio is beautiful and contemporary but still casual at the same time. Definitely hit their happy hour because that's the happiest time of day anyway and you mind as well spend it here enjoying delicious eats and tasty libations.  (By the way, why is someone complaining that this is not authentic Hawaiian food when at the same time they ordered a New York Steak sandwich?  Does someone have their crabby pants on or is a geography lesson in order?)

I avoided this store for years because of the weird name, but with a newborn, you constantly need more "stuff" so being in the area, I stopped in here and was pleasantly surprised.  It's similar to Babies R Us which is where I normally go but I have to say, I think they have an even better selection here. Not only that, one of the very nice employees gave me a refresher course on my Bugaboo which I hadn't used in years and was like kryptonite to Superman when I tried to use it. So nice and such a big selection, I'll definitely be back.

Well, they don't have a Sunday brunch buffet which is the only time I generally go to a casino, but we saw Kathy Griffin here when she performed and it was a good show. The theater is not banked and the seats aren't very cosy so keep that in mind when you buy tickets.

I can't believe Ada G. beat me to reviewing this place.  They weren't in Yelp before and when I tried to add them it wouldn't work.  User error I'm sure.  Maybe should have tried before that glass of wine.  Anyway, 80% probably of the toddler's grossly packed closet comes from here and because I'm such a clothes whore, it's obviously worn off on him.  (Possibly projected.)  Aside of liking the price of $8 Adidas pants rather than paying $35 (yes, they're really $35 in real life) I really like the aspect of recycling/reusing things.  It's like kittens and puppies.  The world doesn't need more kittens and puppies so you should get yours fixed, likewise why keep those sweatshops working double time?  OK, my analogy really sucks and I clearly shouldn't be Yelping while drinking but if you have children, come here to shop.  I outfit my beautiful long haired boy in Ralph Lauren, Adidas, Puma, Quicksilver, Volcom and most any big label that floats your boat.  (They also have Ed Hardy but please people, that so overdone.  Please don't put your children in it.  They'll look like last years seconds.)  They also have a nice selection of toys, puzzles, books and the like.  Good puzzles too.  The nice, thick wood kind and sometimes you can find the cool retro wood toys here too.  I've even seen a Bugaboo Frog here once.  If you would have snatched it up you could have pushed your little sweet pea around in it on those days you're feeling bourgeois riche.

I came here with P for pedicures, we had the Groupon so we thought we would incorporate it into our happy hour.  The place is shiny and beautiful and unlike some other yelpers, I found the pedicure chair comfortable but the paraffin dip burned both of us and I'm someone who likes things very hot.  When we both complained and jumped when they put the hot wax on our feet, they only rolled their eyes.  Additionally, both of our polish started chipping a day or two later.  I expect a much longer wear than that.  Even with a Groupon, I wouldn't go back.  Burned feet and chipped polish aren't worth any deal.

My friend P and I have been waiting for what seems like forever for this place to open.  Finally, a taste of La Grande Orange/Postino and Pizzeria Bianco in Ahwatukee?  It's about time.  These at least were supposed to be some of the guys behind it so we thought of course the food would be delicious and the menu would be original.  When I finally saw an 'OPEN' sign on the other day, we made plans for lunch.    After a little bit of last minute Christmas shopping we stopped in for lunch and of course all morning I was joking that I hoped it wasn't just salads and cold sandwiches and of course, it was.  We nearly walked out with only two kinds of salads of four sandwiches on the menu (and nothing out of ordinary either - I'm talking Caesar salads and turkey sandwiches) when we spotted the burger and saw the special of the day was a half roast chicken with rosemary roasted potatoes.  We decided to split those but just went with water when nothing in their drink case inspired us.  Just  some Coke, Diet Coke and a couple of specialty sodas.  Just a couple.  Not much of a selection.    We let the toddler pick a table and waited about 15 minutes for our food to come out.  I almost laughed out loud when I saw our rosemary potatoes.  There were only six pieces.  Not six small potatoes.  Six tiny potato wedges.  I think they were rationing them but once we tried them and found they had been in the oven about 20 minutes too long, neither of us wanted them anyway.  The chicken was equally dried out but also bland.  The leg and thigh was better than the breast but I expect the whole bird tho be juicy and moist.  If Safeway can get it right for $4.99, I certainly expect a decent restaurant to be able to.  At least we had the burger, right?  I ordered it rare because it's always overcooked and it came out medium, which I expected.  It was nice and large but other than that, there isn't anything else nice to say about it.  It had a gamey flavor to the meat and the bun, described as 'Artesinal' on the menu, had the taste and consistency of the butt ends of a loaf of Wonder bread.  Additionally, the bun was coated in a thick schmear of yellow ballpark style mustard.  Maybe it was meant to cover up the gamey flavor of the meat, I don't know, but you couldn't taste much else.    A man looking like a manager was walking table to table asking how things were but seemingly only going to table with men - probably unconsciously.  We probably looked like a couple of empty-headed moms who sit around and watch soap operas all day and buy most of our meals through a drive-thru window and couldn't have an opinion of our own, so why would he ask how our meal was?  I was looking forward to telling him what a disappointment it was and how my palate hadn't been that offended since the last time I ate airplane food.  Because this place has such promising owners behind it, I'm going to give it a few months and check out their menu again.  If it's changed, I'll go back but it's been a while I've been this 'wronged' at such a promising restaurant.

Boy have they improved since they opened!  I just met a friend here for brunch this morning and it was great. We both had mimosas which were excellent and I had some egg white omelet loaded with fresh veggies. I'm proud to have this great restaurant right in my hood!

A blah sandwich we had to wait 20 minutes for.  Not worth the $8 price tag.  We should have gone across the street to Subway if we wanted a mediocre sandwich and saved a few bucks and some time while we were at it.

Not as good as the Ahwatukee one, but I picked up some cheap kids toys and books.  Even a glow in the dark dinosaur bones building set!  I was in for some of those Fido clamping jars.  No such luck this time but I'll be back.

I'm here at least every other week for a gel manicure and often for a pedicure too.  Sarah H and I often come together because a pedicure is more fun with a friend.  The salon is clean and well organized and beautifully designed.  The nail techs are always friendly and very accommodating.  I've been coming here almost exclusively for the last two years and I'm happy I discovered it,

So we hobbled over here in our high heels (car hunting wasn't on the days agenda) from Ferrari to find some Cayenne's they had advertised on-line.  At least the salesman got up out of his chair but had no clue where any of the cars were.  I've never heard "aint" "wanna" and "dunno" so many times in one conversation, let alone from a Lotus salesman.  On the upside, they sell Fisker's here too.  Come in for a little eye candy.

They got one star because I do have counter tops, but only after blood, sweat, tears and utter agony.  I got a townhouse in January that needed a complete re-haul and my contractor suggested Elegant Granite for my counter-tops.  To make a long story short, they put a huge seam (like a keloid scar) in my counter-top and first blamed it on not enough granite (there was, they calculated to do it in one piece), then on it breaking on their way over.  They recanted that when I pointed out I had the same granite in my old house with a much larger piece.  Eventually she just gave up and stated that I didn't specify no seams so I got seams.  I got a massive slab of granite so that it required no seams.  No seams is a given.  I would have done granite tiles and saved a lot of money of I wanted seams.  Additionally, they tried to over charge me close to $800 but backed down when I fought them.  End of story, I will definitely use Franco's marble again the next time I do granite.  Never again will I use Elegant Granite and I will tell everyone I know not to use them.  08/24/11  Simona comented on my review and yet she still can't stick with a single reason for the seam.  In the future I will always use Franco's.  Trust me on this, immaculate work and first class service even a year later when you chip the edge of the counter yourself.

Sarah H and I came in for lunch today because we've been both wanting to try it for a while.  The restaurant was bustling when we arrived so we waited line and ordered our lunch.  I settled on the Elephant Curry Bowl, recommended by the cashier and Sarah ordered the Daily Burger which was a sweet potato burger today and a pomegranate lemonade.  We took our table market and found a place to sit and chatted while we waited for our food.    Her lemonade came out first.  It looked like the pomegranate was fresh squeezed.  I forget her exact words but something like it was interesting.  She drank most of it, but not all.  Also, the glass of lemonade was on the small side.  Not what I would expect for $3.  Our meals came out and my Elephant Bowl looked good.  Yellow curry with lots of fresh vegetables and brown rice and tofu.  Everything I like.  Maybe I should have just ended the meal there before the disappointment set in. For a curry it was terribly bland and strangely enough made my tongue numb.  I ended up bringing the majority of it home and spiced it up a bit so I could finish it.  I had a bite of Sarah's burger and it was pretty good.  It tasted predominately of sweet potatoes and lentils, but I enjoy both of those.  She had the root vegetable fry's on the side and those were good as well seasoned with rosemary.    I would like to try this place again.  I noticed that many of the reviews were not good for many's first visit but then improved with their second.  It might be good for Abu J with his vegan/supermodel diet.  I'm curious what he'll think of it.

Poor selection (most are fuddy-duddy mommy clothes), grossly overpriced and the whole store smells like old shoes.  This definitely won't be on my rounds.

Sarah H and I came by here for a massage after lunch on Friday and I agree completely with Dan H.  It's not the typical massage (your clothes stay on) but felt great and you can't beat the price.

I met a friend here for lunch last Sunday.  We ordered several types of rolls, all predominately tuna and salmon, and we enjoyed every single one of them.  I ate way more than I needed to but it was so good, I couldn't stop!

I went ATVing this weekend with Ada G's husband (she was going to come too but chickened out because she thought we'd go too fast - we did).  We met them way out in North Scottsdale and I got an automatic (something bigger and bulkier with 4WD) and Jan got a 400 (I can't drive a "stick shift" motorcycle, only a car).  We got a brief lesson then the guy led us down the path and we took off.  God that's fun!  For two hours straight we went as fast as those things would take us.  It was my first time so I wasn't sure if I could keep up with him (he's done it before and rides a motorcycle) but I managed to.  Finally after two hours we were so worn out we decided to call it a day (they give you three hours).  My hands were so sore from hanging on I had to ride slower on the way back because I didn't think I could hold myself on if I flew up again on the big bumps.  Jan and the owner told me I did great for my first time and I have a natural talent.  Go figure.  Some people have the gift of music.  Some are wonderful with children, some have amazing minds and have the potential to cure disease.  My special talent is riding an ATV.  I must have some redneck in my blood somewhere.  They would have earned five stars had they not tried to repeatedly get out of their promotion.  They advertised on facebook 'rent one get one half off'.  First they tried to tell me that promotion was over so I copied it and emailed it to them then they said since it wasn't clear (it had an expiration date in the future) they would honor it (reluctantly) then when it was decided we wanted an unguided tour rather than a guided tour or to pick up the ATVs and a trailer (all included in the promotion), not only did the price go up, but the promotion didn't apply.   Why would an unguided tour cost more than a guided tour?  This makes no sense to me.  Anyway, despite this I will definitely go again.  I didn't hurt myself (shockingly), only some narrow misses so it was a great success.  Now if you'll excuse me, time for some more Advil.  Muscles I didn't even know I had hurt.

Tart frozen yogurt and fresh fruit.  They even have those crazy little mochi things I like.  It's not as good (flavor wise) as MoJo's, but it is only a few miles away from home so they get points for that.  The toddler LOVES coming here and building a yogurt with crazy candy toppings.  It's a little kid's wet dream.  Tart frozen yogurt with lots of toppings in Ahwatukee.  Yeah!

Wow!  So good.  I came here with Sarah A (aka Dr Sarah) to give it a try before it got too hot out eat soup and I loved it.  I got a simple traditional ramen bowl with tofu and ate up every last drop.  I understand its not authentic ramen but that's fine by me because it still tastes great.  After all, Taco Bell isn't authentic Mexican food and I like them too.    I'm looking forward to fall just so I can come here and enjoy some more ramen.

I came here for Sunday brunch with Sarah H and Dan H and it was glutinous.  It can easily compete with a Vegas buffet.  Three kinds of smoked salmon, crab, shrimp and sushi just to name a few of my favorites.  It is well worth the $30 price.

We had a groupon to get in, so that alone saved the experience a bit.  There are free horse rides for the kids, a petting zoo and a hay maze but all those things took us only about 45 minutes.  Next we took the hay ride out to the pumpkin patch, what we were all looking forward to most.  The hayride was fun but the pumpkin patch was just precut overpriced pumpkins sitting on bales of hay.  I talked my sweet pea into skipping the pumpkin, I figured we could buy one at Trader Joe's for less and I wouldn't have to carry it so far.  We survived, but we definitely won't be there again.

I'm happy we have a second H&M and I'm happy this one isn't so filled with business clothes or clothes of a genre one might dime 'heroine chic' (or maybe that's just me). This new H&M has most of their lines, lots of everyday clothes (cute tops, skirts, sexy dresses) and some more casual things too as well as some business wear (not to mention the cute bikinis and lingerie - lingerie is always my weakness). I'd love it if H&M opened a third location a little farther south. Maybe in the Chandler mall?

The week after I brought my newest sweet pea home from the hospital (aka the bug) my dishwasher and garbage disposal quit working (both were plugged into the same outlet so I figured it was electrical) and my washing machine broke. Of course.  When it rains, it pours.  Mike made it out the next day and after working on it for about a bit, it turned out my breaker wasn't resetting right and something was caught in my garbage disposal (I think it was canibalizing itself) which caused it to seize up and throw the breaker.  Mike even managed to fix my garbage disposal for me.    In passing I mentioned my washer needed a $600 repair and he recommended I get even more quotes.  In doing so a very nice repair man told me that since it was a GE, it was probably still under warranty.  Turns out it was and I only had to pay $250 to get it fixed.  Much better and I can thank Mike for the suggestion which saved me $350.

We regularly stop on here on Fridays after school for a treat.  I get a tiny dab of tart covered in berries and mango's while my sweet pea gets a bit of nearly every flavor and tops it with cereal, candies and whatever else he can find.  Nice and clean and a good variety.

Finally. A sandwichy-type place for lunch that has more that just sandwiches and salads. My friend and fellow partner in shopping-crime (wait, that makes us sound like shopliffters) and I ended up here after a disastrous (and odoriferous) trip to the Hidden Closet next door. We both like most everything so we always split and chose the crab and cilantro dip with plantain chips and the corn, tomato, bacon and goat cheese flat bread pizza.   The dip came out immediately and at first we were a little disappointed because it was cold and we felt it would have been better warm, but after eating it a while, we decided that it was refreshing to have it cold. The serving size was very generous and it got our approval. The toddler liked the plantain chips too (he thought they were bananas) and partook in the dipping with us.   The pizza was the size of a large dinner plate and was covered in goodness. The corn was still crisp, the cherry tomatoes just "popped" and the bacon smokey. It was crowned with a mound of arugula and Parmesan that complemented it beautifully. If I lived closer and came here often, I would definitely get this pizza again.   We left satiated and on to our next stop. What a lucky find to stumble across.

I was a lucky girl the other night. Rico, B's husband has moved from Z Tejas to the Herb Box so I got to tag along to the "practice night", I'm sure there's technical term for if for those in the business but for me it meant free dinner at one of my favorite places.   First, the decor. You can't work in interior design for six years and not notice design. They've done it up in a cozy Cape Cod feel with exposed beams, wide plank floors, lots of blue and sea colors. Not so much you feel like you're in a sea food restaurant, but in a chic way. It has a little bit of a contemporary feel and the bathrooms are very cool. Check out the sinks. Go on. You need to go just for that.   B and I got there first, another friend was meeting us but was running a little late so we started with the cilantro crab dip, one of my favorites. There are nice, big chunks of crab in it and the plantain chips it comes with are thin, crisp and salty. For the main course B decided on the goat cheese chicken and enjoyed it. Our other friend got her old standby the Market Sunflower Salad and added salmon. I debated between the trout and the short ribs and ultimately decided on the short ribs but think next time I'll go with the trout. I have to say the short ribs were the second best I've had, in line right behind Chelsea's Kitchens. For dessert our waiter brought us a slice of the stout cake with espresso frosting, pure heaven, and a piece of the blackberry bread pudding. The bread pudding was more like a steamed dumpling and was lacking in flavor though the creme anglais it came with was creamy and unctuous. The espresso frosting on the cake reminded me of penuche candy.  I wasn't too excited to get a piece of cake but it really was a nice treat.  I just ate the frosting off the back I was so full by this time.   The Herb Box also has a beautiful patio with big windows opening to the bar and comfortable, intimate fireplaces. This is such a convenient location right in old town and steps away from the mall, I know it will become a regular place for me.

Now take this with a grain of salt because I only came in for drinks.  Elaine B and I stopped in for a quick drink before book club one night and were excited to try the finally open Los Dos.  We sat at the bar and waited a good 10 minutes to be served by the bartender who was blatantly ignoring us.  We finally got her attention and ordered our beers.  She brought us some chips and salsa, it was average at best.  We finished our drinks and paid and Elaine B noticed the next day when checking her bank account that she was grossly overcharged.  Never again.

I have been here a couple times now and it's a new favorite. I figured it would be of course being in the Postino family and I wasn't disappointed. I shared a sample platter of appetizers (best smoked salmon ever) and a burger and each was superb. There also is a delicious cocktail with rum and orange marmalade syrup. Not too sweet, just delicious!

My favorite Smashburger location!  I LOVE their black bean burgers and their sweet potato fries with extra chipotle dipping sauce.  So delicious.  Also, be sure to sign up for their email.  I'm always receiving free deals from them.

Finally!  A cute little wine and cheese shop in Ahwatukee.  I haven't had any cheese yet, but I will on Tuesday night when we go for Dan H's art premiere.  I did enjoy a lovely glass of champagne and I must say that a glass of champagne first makes my Trader Joe's shopping all the more pleasurable.

I used Barefoot Organic because they had good reviews and a coupon here on yelp.  I called to make my appointment as was told they could come out the next day which was great.  The man arrived and I asked about cleaning an area rug downstairs too.  He said he could for an additional $20 and it came out great.  As good as new.  Upstairs where I have carpet, I showed him a couple of spots and he said he thought he could get them out, and he did but my traffic areas still looked dingy after so I have to say I was disappointed all in all and they weren't even very dirty to start with.  We never wear our shoes on them and I vacuum them a couple times a week.  I normally use Jasper's and have for years (they have changed their name but if you Google Jasper's you can find them) and I think I will continue too.  It's about the same price but I am left with much cleaner carpets.

We got completely addicted to an ice cream sandwich place in San Diego on Mission Beach (maybe it was north enough to be Pacific Beach) and were sad there wasn't anything like that here.  Well guess what?  There was!  We just never knew about it.  And the best part, ice cream sandwiches here are only $2!  We were paying close to $6 in San Diego.

Today was my first time at Dutch Brothers.  My mom really likes it and I always see a long line out front so I thought I would give it a try.  I pulled up behind a good 10 cars or so and the reviews I read were right, the line moves nice and fast and the employees were exceedingly friendly.  Now to my coffee.  I ordered a caramelizer and once it cooled down I took a sip and was shocked at how bad it was.  It took me a while to put my finger on it, but I tasted either like I took a packet of cheap cocoa mix and dumped it in a cup of gas station coffee or like I got one of those cheap flavored lattes from a machine at a convenience store.  Actually, scratch that.  Those are better.  The coffee was barely flavored and had a powdery consistency to it.    I'm completely surprised at how poor the quality was.  This is a popular place.  I'm willing to bet I got a bad cup somehow but I think I'll come back a second time to see for sure.  That was a complete waste of $4.25. I'd give them only one star, but like I said, the line moved nice and fast and the employees were friendly and helpful.

What an adorable place!  Years ago when I was still in the work force working at an interior design company, we did some of the model homes here.  I adored the area then and I can't believe it took me this long to get back out here.  The whole area is beautiful with the farm and the homes around here are built to look old, they look nothing like the average Arizona home, and the two restaurants here never fail to please me.  I was out this way picking up a plasma car on craigslist with my boys and we stopped at the coffee shop for an iced coffee for mommy and to kill a couple of hours.  The boys rode the plasma car all over the winding paths.  We had a great time.

I went to the yelp event last night with Sarah H and Sarah A and we all had a blast.  Yummy food by Brio and the chance to get crafty!  Because my little sweet pea was heart broken he couldn't come, I made him a candle with sharks and dolphins on it and the biggest hit, soap!  The soap with the hot pink brain and glitter, scented with Birthday Cake, was his favorite and he used it this morning in the shower.  I'm looking forward to bringing him here so we can make something together.

Let me preface all of this with I am not much of a meat eater and I generally don't care much fir barbecue. A friend picked this up when we were watching the Derby and wow!  Totally delicious. He offered and I accepted to take some leftovers home with me and just enjoyed some now.  We had the brisket, the turkey, some ribs and potato salad, cole slaw, three bean salad and bread. If you're not a barbecue fan, try this!  It's amazing.

New ownership = bad news. At least in this case. For starters, they don't have oysters anymore which was always a huge draw for happy hour. I got over that and ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, shishito peppers, grilled artichokes, drunken bread and my friend ordered the steak frite.   My wine was brought out and it was warm. Not even room temperature warm but warmer than that. It wasn't the cool and refreshing glass of white wine I was looking for on a hot sunny day. Our food came out and the disappointments continued. They had changed the delicious lemony herb sauce that came with the artichokes. Now it's basically just mayonnaise. Also disappointing was the drunken bread. It used to be a fondue poured over the bread then cooked. Now it was cheese toast and I can make cheese toast at home, it's nothing fancy. Besides that, that waiter said they cut back and only use fontina now, no Gruyere and you can tell. The shishito peppers were good and my friend enjoyed her steak but if they don't get back to the quality they used to have, I won't be back.

What a beautiful job!  I got a new to me car and it badly needed a waxing and the front windows were tinted a lighter color than the back.  I checked on yelp and they had all five star reviews so I thought I would give them a try.  They came and picked up my car in the morning and delivered it back to me by lunch with fresh tint and a waxing.  She's never looked better.

They do a decent car wash a good oil change and have free popcorn while you wait. The only bad thing I can say is they used to dry your car off and you drove your car through the car wash yourself, but they don't anymore.

Wow.  It's really been a while since I rushed home to write a review.  I met Sarah H and Dan H here tonight for happy hour.  They just opened on Monday and we were excited something new had opened in the Foothills and we wanted to support them.  Well, first off we met here for happy hour but the only happy hour specials they had was on beer and wine.  Not nearly as happy as we were hoping.  We ordered some drinks, I had a nice Sauvignon Blanc, and looked over the menu.  Nothing on the menu is very inspired or unique but I finally settled on a Mexican salad with black beans and chipotle ranch.  Something cool and crunchy and spicy sounded just right.  Dan ordered a Tuscan meat and cheese platter and Sarah wasn't really hungry so she just got the chili cheese dip which I was looking forward to trying anyway.    We chatted while we were waiting for our food but the place is so loud, it wasn't easy and they had the most god awful music on.  Not quite loud enough you could understand it, but loud enough that it made it difficult to chat.  We thought we heard country music but couldn't be sure.  They definitely need to play something more café-ish to set the ambiance of a good meal with friends rather than being at a rodeo.  Sarah's chili cheese dip came out first and we dug in.  It reminded us a lot of that Velveeta dip you make with a can of Rotel, only not as good.  And they didn't give you much either.  We ate it nonetheless because it's cheese, but I don't think we'll be ordering it again.  Dan's meat and cheese plate looked fine but my salad wasn't quite what I expected.  When I ordered it the waitress asked if I wanted Spring Mix for my lettuce or a green lettuce mix.  While I normally go for the darker greens, I thought a green lettuce mix would be best to stand up to a heavy ranch dressing.  What I got was a mix of spinach and arugula, predominately spinach, which couldn't stand up to the creamy dressing and was a soppy mess.  I ate it, but I can't say I would ever order it again.  Any salad here for that matter as the dressing was put on with such a heavy hand, it made what is normally a light meal, heavy and greasy.    We paid and were on our way in under an hour.  It was too noisy and not really conducive to a long leisurely evening of chatting, drinking and eating.  Maybe if they change their menu a bit and I give them some time to work out the kinks, I may try it again, but I'm sure.

Now mind you, all of these consignment shops are completely hit or miss, but they have a good selection of kids clothes, good prices and the quality is always nearly as good as new and frankly, once they've worn it, it's not new anyway so who cares.  They also have great sales now and then.  Once everything under a certain price, I think around $6 or $8 was half off.  I really stocked up then.

I love this place so much that when I was still working (pre layoff) I told everyone about it (and I worked with about 40 girls) so I gladly brought Express Shoe Repair a lot of business. I've been coming here since 2001 and being a big fan of Last Chance, I often have a pair of shoes or a handbag that needs a little TLC. They always do a beautiful job, their prices are more than reasonable and your items come out looking beautiful and shiny new and it often takes as little as one day. This may sound a little strange, but one of the things I like best about this place is if they can't do the job right, they'll tell you they can't do it instead of doing it, jacking it up and charging you for it and leaving you with a mess. I would definitely drive here from anywhere in the east valley.

My sweet pea has been wanting to go for a while now so we met Sarah H and Dan H here last night for some fun. I got my sweet pea the $10 bracelet for attractions and the $20 game card for $10. We had a lot of fun playing laser tag and walking on the Sky Trail. My sweet pea even "won" a watch and two necklaces with the grabby hand game!  My only complaints would be that the happy hour isn't happy at all, just a couple if drinks and no food specials and the bowling filled up with leagues and there was a long wait list so we couldn't bowl and the attractions bracelet included it so I kind of felt like we couldn't do something we paid for. All in all, pretty good though and we will be back.

Average at best. Sarah H and I came after riding with big appetites and decided to split the vegan chorizo burrito, berry pancakes and a side of jalapeño cornbread. The burrito was great but everything else lacked. The sweet potato hash that came with the burrito was raw and crunchy. The pancakes were ok but tasted like they came out of a box at best. It was edible but not somewhere we will be back to.

Now don't get me wrong, the cakes are absolutely gorgeous and they are moist, but they are cloyingly sweet and "single noted". With the rave reviews they had I thought I would splurge and pick one up for a family get together, but I was sorely disappointed. I could have made the same (or better) from a packaged cake mix and saved the $35.

A friend bought a red velvet cake for a party.  Under duress I took a bite to be polite.  It was everything I dreaded and more.  This time it was also gummy and stuck to the roof of my mouth.  The gift that keeps on giving.

Completely delicious. It's nice to have some healthy food options and this place fits the bill. Their produce is super fresh too and they grow their own tomatoes!

I stopped here on the way home from the zoo hoping for some bargains but truth be told, you'll do better price wise on the clearance racks at a regular retail Lululemon store or on line in the "We Made Too Much" section.   For example, they had a white pacesetter running skirt for $49. I bought mine on clearance at the Chandler mall for $39 and it's currently on sale on line for $34. They did have a large quantity of sales items, the whole store is sales items and the store is divided into sizes so that's handy but prices were more than I expected.

One of our new favorite places around.  My boys split a cookie s'mores bowl and it was so delicious it was beyond words.  We also picked up a s'mores pack of marshmallows for a little treat. Whenever we are in Gilbert, we will come here.  Consider us regulars!

They would only get three stars because you have to woo me a bit more to get four stars but the toddler and I have been going to the Summer time kid movie thing every Thursday morning where you pay $7 in advance for 10 rerun kids movies (a friends dad had to tell us about it - I'm not one of those moms that intuitively knows where all these kids things are going on at all times). They manage all those kids pretty well and the theater is pretty clean. That alone impresses me.
