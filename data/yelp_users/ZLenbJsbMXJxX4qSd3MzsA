I have always loved this place and everyone I bring here loves it too. I go at least once a month and never had any problems. Really cool stuff to look and the merchandise is fun too.  The staff is usually friendly and the prices aren't too high. This is the only place I can find really good smoked meat!

I usually stay out of this place for reasons my creditors and husband won't understand. Way too many temptations here for me to deal with. I did talk the hubby into "looking" at a new vacuum and compare models. I wasn't in there 5 minutes and out comes a really nice lady asking me if I want help or if she could get me a vacuum from the back. I  wasn't totally convinced I wanted to buy one yet, but since she was there and bored and very nice I thought I'd humor her. She went to find the model I pointed to and here came 2 older gents to see if I needed more help. I felt like I was Princess Dianna...God rest her soul. (thanks also for my hubby not lookin like hers) yuckies! Anyway I had 3 people helping me and no luck on the model I liked being in stock and they were on back order online. Then I was swamped with what I could do or what I wanna do. They gave me the choice of buying at this location and picking up in Gilbert. I took it and we ran off to customer service. Steve my salesman says he has never done this before and then I got 3 more people trying to figure out how it's supposed to work. Some new thing they do called oms something. They get me all fixed up and send me to Gilbert for my new toy. This bunch was just as nice and friendly as the other ones, so it made my experience much less painful. By the way Hoover Vacuums work really well and much cheaper and longer warranty than that $600.00 Dyson. I'm sure Dyson rocks but I don't have a Princesses budget.

I have been eating here for over 10 years and love it every time I go. From the nuts to the steak, I'm happy! I usually order the same things all the time, I have tried most everything on the menu and haven't found anything I'll spit out! It always crowded so get there between 4-5 p.m. or have a seat after that and chew on some peanuts while you wait for a table. It's a good place for the picky eaters and kids, or if you like your salads they have those too. If you don't like noise and have an issue with stepping on peanut shells STAY HOME!   Feel free to make sure they cook your steak perfectly I have had it happen to me a few times....*new cook*  equals raw steak YUCK! No mooing steaks for me please. Send it back til they get it right or don't pay for it!  Anyways, enjoy have a good time and be relaxed when you go and you'll be fine!

I have tried to eat here off and on for the 8 years I've lived here. NONE OF THEM WERE FULL ACCLOMPISHED TRIPS! I tried to order something just on the 4th of July. They weren't all that busy so I walked in and sat at the bar next to the TO GO register. I was in a hurry to get back to work because I only have 30 minutes for lunch. I was greeted by a hefty young man and was told someone will be with me shortly. Ten minutes come and go and the same large waitress walks past me 4 times without a hello and I can't seem to find the young man, on top of this the very freakie store manager is behind the counter helping prepare orders, which are flying off the counter fast. The manager looks at me often and never does anything but stare at me like a creepy old perv.! 4 very loud women run in to the opposite side of the counter and the large waitress tells them hello and they quickly place an order for fries and onion rings. Shortly after the 4 women pay for their order the large girl walks away like I wasn't sitting there, with a menu and waiting for *someone*.  This place can go to hell! I'm just going to act like this place never existed and warn others to do the same.

OMG! this place is heaven for women and everyone who wants the place they live to be awesome and do it on a poor mans budget. I buy almost everything here and love to take newbies there and watch their mouths hit the floor. Between the size of the store, the low prices to that heavenly smell of cinnamon rolls baking ALL DAY,  you can't lose.

Hands down one of the best bookstores! The trade counter has come in handy from books to dvds. I did buy a cybershot camera storage disk once and had to return it because it wouldn't load in my camera. (huge error message) I returned it and I HATE returning things!  The saleman was extremely nice and gave me back my money without me having to show him what my camera said. He told me it happens and they buy the items at a risk, but he was just as bummed as I was considering neither of us benefited. I tell everyone I know that needs to sell or is looking for something to go here, and they usually have good luck with it.

I stopped here out of shear hunger and had time to kill. They  just had there grand opening the day before I got there. I walked in and the smell of the fresh breads were mind boggling. This place is very tiny and very cheerfully decorated and clean! The ladies behind the counter were still learning the tricks of the trade. Very sweetly greeted me and asked me what I like to order. They have about 10 different sandwiches posted on a very nice menu board and huge options for coffee and all the breads, cakes, pies, tarts, OMG Drool! They will make you any kind of sandwich and hand you more samples than you can shake a stick at. I order the turkey and had it on a fresh baked croisant. Too yummy to explain. The green tea was fresh brewed and out of this world. If you go remember they are as fast as Subway but they will knock your socks off!
