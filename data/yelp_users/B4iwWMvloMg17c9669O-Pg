Have you tried finding a business that provides gift wrapping services this holiday season?  Well, I did and was next to impossible. That is, until I found "The Mail Room".   I had to have a large box of gifts wrapped, packed and shipped in time for Christmas for two 7 year old girls and the ladies at The Mail Room handled everything PERFECTLY.    The packing and gift wrap was just gorgeous.  And when they were done they even texted me a photo of what the gifts looked like inside the gift box as well as the outside of the gift wrapped box.  ABSOLUTELY SUPERB.  I will be using these guys for now on.

I've been a customer of Aj's for over 25 years, and have been coming back to this location every time I'm in the area.  Simply put, there is NOTHING like this place.  The quality and customer service is PERFECTION.  Amazing deli, bakery and butcher shop and easily the best quality fruits and veggies anywhere.  I'd give them 50 STARS if I could.

This place is a total lifesaver.  Always superclean.  The service is fast, polite and professional.  I literally stop in for gas and a cold drink every day.  THE BEST !!

One of my favorite Starbucks.  The service is awesome and there's always a good crowd.  it's great to spend the early morning on the patio which faces the corner of Mill and 5th...

I know this sounds crazy, but yesterday at around 8:30am, a large 6 rotor flying robot drone from the sky came crashing down onto my SUV, while I was parked in the parking lot in front of the Fro Yo shop at the 202 and Scottsdale road in Tempe.  The angry robot was banging and whirring up against the driver's side door, and when I opened the door the thing spun around and sliced my wrist and ankle. I jumped out of the car and saw that my arm was covered in blood. Of course I hit 911 and Tempe Fire Dept. and Tempe PD arrived within minutes, cleaned me up, took photos and impounded the evil robot as evidence. UNBELIEVABLE.  Well. To make a long story short, I ended up over at Next Urgent Care to get treated (8 stitches) and they got me in and out with no hassle and took awesome care of me.  They were professional start to finish. I wish I could give them 6 stars for being so great.

Do you enjoy hanging out with hipster douchebags? Are you a hipster douchebag? If your answer is yes,  then Cartel is for you.  The  place is infested with packs of unwashed,  pretentious ass clowns in skinny jeans.  Sure,  the coffee is fine,  but why suffer the hordes of annoying art-school losers just to get a cup of Joe?

Can I give 0 stars? Without a doubt the absolute worst Starbucks on the planet, and I've been coming here very regularly for about three years. Our office is close by and it's just convenient to go here to get my morning coffee before heading to work and such.  in particular, this week specifically was the last straw when I was pretty disappointed with the horrible service that I received from the Manager, Tiffany, here, who was a REAL bitch and gave me an crappy attitude about having to get my drink right. It's a shame as I've been going to this Starbucks on a regular basis and have had my Gold card for years... I just won't ever be coming back to this location.    My orders are always very simple - Extra Hot Vente Latte, but, they've consistently gotten my orders wrong AT LEAST 20% of the time, and yet, I've always tried to be civil about their utter incompetence.   Go down the street to Dutch Brothers. Better coffee. Much better employees.

Dannys Car Wash is the WORST car wash in Arizona. HORRIBLE customer service. Manager Juan Delgado at the Tempe Marketplace location is a total jackass.   I brought a BRAND NEW car to Dannys for a minor windshield repair and they TOTALLY RUINED the windshield.    To make matters worse, when I went to the General Manager (Juan Delgado) to complain about this issue he was extremely rude, laughed and blew me off.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THESE CAR WASH CLOWNS.

How this store stays open, I have no idea. This store is literally filled with idiots. This store and T-Mobile in general deserves NO STARS!  The reps are completely incompetent and don't know what they are talking about.  I've been given incorrect information left and right. Apparently the management of this store has no clue what customer service is all about. If you're thinking about switching, think again.  They are the worst! I have been to many.. many.. T-Mobile stores and this one is the worst. Employees are slow. Most of them very uneducated and clueless. Just all around poor customer service. This store needs a TON of work.

These guys have the right attitude when it comes to product and service.  They are consistently top notch.  Their people are well trained and always very friendly.  Dutch Bros is easy to give a 5 star rating for their great coffee and even better service.

The WORST WORST WORST place in town.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN !!!  The dryers didn't work leaving my clothes sopping wet and the 2 extremely RUDE women working there, REFUSED to refund my money.    The place was filthy dirty and crowded and there were not enough laundry carts.   Moreover, the women working there had a HORRIBLE ATTITUDE toward the customers.  There's hardly ever any parking spaces available and homeless bums, drug addicts and drunks hang out in front bothering customers for spare change...  DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE PEOPLE.    THE WORST !!!!

I feel the most important factor in finding a good auto mechanic is trust.  Can you trust they are giving you a fair price and can you trust they know what they're doing with your Mercedes?  Unfortunately, that's hard to find, from both the shady looking smaller shops around the city to the dealerships, who may be the shadiest of them all.  I've gone to Charles and Chris at Autohaus for a while now, getting regular service to my S550, and I've always felt my car was in good hands.  The space is clean and organized, and everyone I've dealt with has been very professional.  I never had a problem with any of their work in that time. The real kicker, though, is the level of service from these guys is outstanding.  They'll listen carefully to you, they'll take the time to explain everything thoroughly, they'll be honest about what you really need vs. what can wait a while, they've even thrown in a couple free services just for the hell of it.  I've been much more impressed with the level of service from Autohaus than I'd received from other dealerships in Scottsdale.  Bottom line is, if you want solid work and service that goes the extra mile, for a whole lot less than any of the dealerships, this is the place.

These guys are total creeps. Their service BLOWS and their pizza is AVERAGE at best. Tonight I tried ordering a pizza for delivery and the guy on the phone was a total moron. The delivery driver ending up getting lost, and then called me and told me that I "sucked"... STAY AWAY FROM THE JERKS...

Unfortunately, last week I suddenly began to lose vision in my left eye.  Trust me, you NEVER want to deal with that situation. So, of course, I was desperate to be seen by the eye doctor, and when I arrived at Nationwide I couldn't even read the form they want you to fill out.    Well.  The guys over there at Nationwide Vision were amazing.  They took superb care of me.  They were nothing short of tremendous from start to finish and NOW I CAN SEE again.    Thanks so much for the great care.

Made the mistake of ordering some soup from these clowns using Grub Hub. So, an hour later the delivery guy (some kid) knocks on the door with the soup, but he doesn't have any change for a twenty.  So, I tell the kid that when he's making deliveries he needs to have change for a twenty, and you what the kid tells me? He says; "GO F*CK YOURSELF" and walks aways with the soup.  NIce.....
