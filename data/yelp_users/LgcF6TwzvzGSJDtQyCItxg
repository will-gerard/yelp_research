Stopped by for a quick bite to eat before heading to the airport and was very happy with the experience.  The service was fast and friendly and the sushi options were awesome.  We had a sashimi platter, california hand roll, a cucumber wrapped roll (can't remember the name), and the deep blue sea roll.  The rolls were good but honestly the sashimi was my favorite part along with the hand roll.  The prices for the lunch sashimi was also great with huge portions of fresh sashimi.  They also give you free miso soup which is always a plus.  I will definitely swing by this place again the next time I am in town.

I have been to this location many times while visiting Phoenix and it is one of my favorite coffee shops in the area.  The coffee is delicious and the drinks are all made.  The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because every time I have been I have had a 5-10 minute wait for my drink even if there is no line.  The last time I went they took my order immediately and I paid immediately and then the wait was almost 10 minutes after before I received my drinks.  Other than that it is awesome and I will definitely return.

Interesting environment and awesome food.  I highly recommend giving the az88 buffalo chicken sandwich a try.   I am personally not a fan of blue cheese so I substituted ranch and it was delicious.  The chicken breast is not fried and almost tastes blackened with a perfect buffalo sauce with pieces of celery on top.  I was feeling indulgent and got it with the fries which were cooked perfectly but tried some of the grilled vegetables from another plate at my table and wish I had chosen them.  The grilled vegetables have almost a smokey flavor and are cooked to perfection.  Cant wait to visit scottsdale again to swing by and have another one of these sandwiches.

I really wanted to love this place... they roast coffee beans at the location and it is always packed.  There are a ton of great reviews as well.... but I have been twice and I am not impressed.  The first visit I placed my order nothing crazy just a vanilla latte.  They were a little busy so I was not expecting it to be a quick wait.  Probably 5-10 minutes later I ended up asking the employee nicely if mine would be done soon because I was concerned that it had gotten lost in the business.  They told me oh yeah it will be done soon.  During this time a friend I was meeting showed up and ordered... everyone who had ordered before and after me had received their drinks but I continued to wait patiently.  My friend (who arrived 15 minutes after me) ended up receiving his drink and I finally asked a second time for them to check on my drink.  At this point 30 minutes after initially ordering the drink the employee finally said "oh I guess someone took your drink" which was not the case because I had been standing at the pick up counter the entire time.  I never received an apology or even had them take responsibility for the situation being handled poorly.  Even after this experience I decided to give them another shot today.  The service was much quicker and the drink order was not lost but they were not very friendly and the iced mocha was very bitter and not enjoyable.  After these two experiences I do not plan to return and have to question the reviews they have received previously.

If you are a costco member and nearby I would not go to any other automated car wash.  This car wash is well organized and fairly quick to get through.  The machine itself is one of the stronger automated car washes I have been through.  My car came out looking great and the strength of the water jets did a great job removing the bugs on my car from the recent long drives.  Wish I had a costco with a car wash near where I live.
