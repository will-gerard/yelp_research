Don't expect much...this is a low end hotel. Everything in room was clean albeit very old. Nice to have a full fridge and kitchen esp for a stay of more than a night or two.  Customer service was decent, friendly. Excellent location if you want to be off strip but not too far. Easy walk to Monorail. Overall, not bad...not great.

Just off the strip but well worth the mile or so drive. Upscale furnishings, dishware, and decor make this feel like a treat. Clear labels in the expansive menus made it easy for us to find vegetarian and gluten free options. Mid-range prices, kid-friendly, and laid-back. Everything was so delicious, staff was courteous and helpful. We started with vegetables pakodas (pakora). Then we had Mango Masala, Palak Paneer, and Baingain Bharta; which were all amazing. The Naan was light and fluffy and the rice perfectly cooked. This is a DON'T MISS restaurant if you are visiting the area.

Skip the buffets but be prepared to wait for a table esp on a weekend morning. However every time I've visited, the staff has always been courteous and efficient and seat people very quickly. The food is delicious and plentiful so come hungry. Be sure to order a giant muffin as your bread side....it's practically a meal in itself.  I've eaten late night and breakfast here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. Definitely a must visit when in Vegas for a weekend.

Hands down the best Indian food we've had and that is saying something. Excellent vegetarian options and they made two perfectly executed custom Vegan dishes for my husband. Customer service was beyond expectations; nice relaxed atmosphere; and located off the strip so great prices for lots of amazing food. We will definitely be making a trip back.

Super helpful service found the perfect pair shoes for a night out. They have TONS of lingerie, toys, lube, hose, clubwear, etc. Classy, well lit store. Would def go again.

My first experience with a Vegas nightclub and I was amazed! Beautiful decor, beautiful staff, incredible, immersive sound system. The moving chandelier was so cool and the dancers and acrobats added a definite Vegas flair to the whole evening. Drinks (even water) were incredibly expensive so I did not partake but I had a blast listening to the djs, dancing, and watching people party. The table service seemed like the way to go if you had the bucks to spend. I prebought tickets so there was really not much of a line to get in although it was a bit of a cluster trying to figure out where to go. I would def recommend this if you are attending a big show....there was no way some of those people in that loooong line were getting in.

Normally I love Senor Taco but this weekend I went in and got food for my three kids and two adults. First they refused to sell me an extra kids drink. Ok, fair enough. Then they made a mistake on my order, corrected it and asked for my card to charge me an extra dollar. To me, that's just bad customer service. Will def think twice about taking my family there next time.

Food is decent, customer service is terrible. This time I was overcharged by $3 for a la carte items that should have been a special combo. When I brought it to the cashier's attention her response was essentially "tough". They have officially lost my business.
