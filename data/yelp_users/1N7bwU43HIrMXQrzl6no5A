This office is poorly organized. Music blares in the rooms. I tried to contact my doctor after getting sicker and the MA wouldn't pass on my message to the MD. Attempted to contact the office manager and they weren't working. Will not be continuing my care at this office.

I Love the Midwives and doctors at this practice!!  I specifically chose this practice because I used to work with Tiffany Jackson, CNM and I always looked forward to doing deliveries with her because of her sense of humor and aura of calmness she exuded with mothers and their babies.  I always said that if I every had a baby I was going to deliver with Tiffany so that's who I looked for when I decided to get pregnant.  She can also rock a gynecology exam like no one's business!  Tiffany Jackson, CNM and Dr. Amber Vegh both went above and beyond the normal practitioner call of duty.  So willing to help and were such an important part of my delivery and recovery.  They both spent extra time and effort into my gestation and recovery.  Both came into the hospital on their days off to check on me and were always fighting to make sure I had the best care possible.  Dr. David Kells has been around forever and knows his stuff.  These practitioners saved my life!  Literally.  The office staff were amazing.  They were always quick with any requests for paperwork and super friendly whenever I had an appointment.    The only reason I gave the practice 4 stars is because the office management is sub standard and unprofessional.
