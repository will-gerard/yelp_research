Cute little place with great teriyaki!! Business owner is a very nice older lady, she cheerfully walks around the tables to check if everything is well.    The Service is outstanding, teriyaki was delicious with rice and veggies. Also if you get a large drink, you get unlimited refills! Yay for raspberry tea!!  Great small business with good food and great service.  Its a must visit if  you're around the area!! :)

This place is the place to go for when you plan to throw a BIG MEXICAN/LATIN FIESTA!!! Si, si, si!!!!! :)  :) They are awesome, It reminds me of Mexico and its Open-aired local markets. Great prices, freshly made corn Tortillas and its also the perfect place to request freshly grounded masa. Thats if you know how to make Tameles from scratch.  I have never dined there, but food looks good!!  I LOVE THE AGUAS FRESCAS!!! OH SOO AMAZING Horchata, Fresa, Sandia and Papaya water!!!! :) YUM, YUM!!! Great service, big smiles everywhere and a large variety of products and produce!!

Hillstone, meet the Hillstone...Have a yabba dabba doo time, A dabba doo time, You'll have a gay old time!!!    I loved this place!! The food was awesome, the service was incredible, our server was super funny and the vibe of this place was so relaxing and fine!! My favorite thing here was the Shrimp Coconut Sushi!! MUY DELICIOSO!!!!! Oh and the Ribs are a massive thing to behold, at first I though there was no way I would even finish half but I did, it was that good I guess that eating it was a very smooth journey of pure meaty goodness that I was able to accomplish to about 3/4 of the way that was because I was full to the heart!! We really enjoyed and loved this place!! We cannot wait to go back again and sink our teeth into another dish of pure goodness!! This place is a must for those who haven't decided to go on in!! Thank us later!!! :)  High five and an A+++

I LOVE LA GRANDE!!! It's a love that will last forever and Ever!!      -I know, kind of crazy, but true :)  This place hold many great memories, from high school times, till now. This is the perfect hot spot to meet up and then wait for the pizzeria to open!  For their ever soo deliciously great sangria!!      -However, My love is mostly for their style, service, products, Tammie Coe baked goodies, coffee, chai, sushi rolls, wine, salads!!  EVERYTHING this place has to offer!!  The view, oh the view, while a bit obstructed, but still visible Camelback Mountain beauty and the overall ambiance of this place. So magically jolly yet calm and enjoyful!!  A MUST visit when close to this area!! I sometimes stop in after a hike, and don't get any weird looks or anything if wearing my workout clothes!  Yes, they offer take-out too, but the best part is being there to enjoy it all fully in its full state!

Amazing service and quickly completed! Other places make me wait over an hour for an oil change or request to keep it in for longer times. Must go, this place is in a slightly hidden location, which in a way is perfect in case you need speedy service!

Great employees!!! Constantly offering amazing service with a smile and their perky small talks, it also offers an abundance of products, well stocked for your daily needs and demands. *** I frequent this Safeway so much, that they even recognize me by name!!! :) That's ALWAYS AWESOME, there is also a great lady very worthy of mentioning, by the name of SUSAN working at the Starbucks inside this location and she is ALWAYS SUPER FRIENDLY and bubbly!!! I adore her!!! No hit or miss with her!!! Always greets me by name with a genuine smile!!! *** Also, wonderful cashiers and meat departments employees!! Honestly everyone at this location is super nice, I always leave with a positive experience!!!

I have been coming to this Safeway for years now, and I have noticed the service decline more and more with time. I noticed the change in management, the manager Craig, has never even noticed the fact that I'm always here, and still get carded when buying alcohol, and find it truly sad that the Safeway service and upkeep is not the same. I will slowly find a different store to frequent and suggest the same to my family.

Friendly, friendly!!       I don't get to travel as much as I would like to at this point in time. However, the times that I have, I've been lucky to fly out from this baby! Phoenix Sky Harbor is truly incredible in delivering great customer service, lovely little shops, and clean grounds. I'm always excited when flying, I love it. But honestly, this airport is by far the friendliest and easiest to maneuver around in, truly awesome!! Oh and Don't forget to visit La Grande Orange, It will be a nice treat before your flight!! :) Chao!! Buen Viaje!! Bon Voyage!!

We magically landed at this sushi place about two weeks ago, so happy we did!!  We loved the location ( Corner of Shea Blvd and Scottsdale) and the amazing Blue lighted fish tanks!! Great entertainment while eating!! We came in close to closing time and they still treated us like royalty!! Much appreciated!!  We then decided for the Eel Roll as well as their Cali roll, Teriyaki Bento Box and some Chicken Yakisoba noodles!! It was all delicious, especially the eel roll and chicken yakisoba!!! Yum :)  We honestly had an amazing time and satisfying conquer from this place. The reason for the four stars is their early closing time!! Oh well :)

- I must disclosed that this dining was done about a month and a week ago.     As you walk into this place you feel relaxed by the delightful Cuban music playing loud enough to hear in the background. I also love the dimmed lighting, oh soo relaxing!!    We were then pleasantly surprised by a warm greeting along with a big smile by our charismatic host, after the place was fully packed. We didn't even bother making a reservation, since the previous time I had visited this spot  was with my best friend who was actually the one who introduced me to this nice little spot, Special thanks Mr. B, and at that time, It was just about half way full.     So we weren't expecting to be seated right away, but we were, very nice!!. My boyfriend and I were both hungry, as usual, so we right away ordered the black bean fritters as our starting appetizer. We were surely pleased, they were hot and mushy on the inside served with a side of avocado dip, OH soo YUM, we also ordered ourselves the lime mojitos, talk about refreshingly good!!      We later ordered our main dishes, Tim got the Pollo Cubano and I ordered the Chicharones de Pollo, it was all pretty dang delicious!! Very flavorful, and just down right taste buds satisfying!!      We finally topped it off with my favorite, Arroz con Leche!! This on the contrary was just OK, it lacked cinnamon i think, I have made way better arroz con leche myself, If you like I'll share my recipe, but the appetizer and our chicken Cuban plates were bomb!! :)  Thank you Havana Cafe for the great service and good food!! :)

Amazing service!! I always know to go to Discount Tire for all of my tire needs!!  I came in on a Monday after getting off work, super upset about my tire, and as soon as I steeped in I was helped right away by Gabriel, he was very informative and kind. He was great at telling me what had gone wrong with my tire. I was very happy with his service, urgency and willingness to help!! This is what great service is all about!!  Thank you very much Gabriel! You made my Monday!!

Best wraps ever!!! I was here on Friday the 28th of September, and It was great!!! The place, is modern, well-kept and clean, with lovely images of Greece all over their walls.     *** I decided to go with their Lemon Chicken pita, with the Cesar sauce and the works in veggies, it tasted extremely fresh and healthy to me!!! BEST WRAP so far!!!! Oh so tasty and also well proportioned, I would love to frequent this spot, but its a long drive from my home!!   ** One day we will meet again!!! :) **

This is the MOST AMAZING PLACE EVER!!!! ***** I feel in love with this small restaurant as soon as we walked in!!! THE OWNER Carlos is FANTASTIC and the food was the best Latin food I have had in my short lived life so far!!! It is simply GREAT, AMAZING, AWESOME, a MUST TRY!! **I had the Encocados de Camaron, it is shrimp in a milky coconut curry sauce with white rice, along with little plantain chips on the side, Mmm GOOD!!  ** My best bud Shashi got their Carne Asada plate, which included a spicy, juicy carne asada steak with lentils and white rice!! I also tasted this and it was AMAZING!!! ***Great place you MUST GO TRY, it was far from my home, but well worth the drive and wait on our plates, since it is all freshly made from scratch. ** I also took 2 of the Guayaba cheese filled empanadas to go for my mom and dad!! THE WERE ALSO AMAZING, I had a bite or two!! :)

THIS Little restaurant is my best friends favorite... and I don't blame him, this place is great!!! The food is oh so amazingly fresh and full of taste buds satisfying sensations to your mouth!!!  _ Carlos, the owner is fantastic!! :)  Small place, but great food and great service!! :) Give it a try if you haven't yet!! The service wait time was moderate, considering it's own and operated by the owner and a small kitchen staff, the wait time then is understandable!!   MY MOST FAVORITE THING FROM THIS PLACE IS the must try ENCOCADOS DE CAMARON, AND the also wonderful GUANABANA SHAKE!!! OH SOOO GREAT!!!

***** This is the worst coffee shop I have experienced by far!!! My Best buddy Mr. S who is probably reading this review (Hola Shashi!!) :) suggested this place since one of his buddies was raving about how good this place was, WRONG!!       The service is unfriendly and super slow. I ordered a simple 16oz Iced, Non-fat Caramel Macchiato and they instead made it with whole milk and denied It was whole. I was like SERIOUSLY this undeniably is Whole milk, the color, consistency and flavor was screaming out, "Yes I'm whole milk!!" :(

This place is Amazing!!!  *** I LOVE THEIR SANDWICHES THUS FAR!!!! "The Michelangelo "  was one of the the most incredible sandwiches that I have had in my life!!! I wish I could remember everything that it had, but that doesn't matter because you should try them out yourself!!! This place is great!!! Truly Great!!! YUM, YUM!!! :)

_ Okay let me be super honest, I feel the need to express my most sincere thoughts about this place. If I could give them a ZERO star review I would!    I really liked this place before, the service used to be good, just chill natural treatment, the hidden/sneaky location, and let's not forget the vibe and the out of the ordinary sandwiches they offer, yet tasty.    However my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely.  I do not plan on ever visiting this sandwich location again, maybe a different spot with a better care for customer satisfaction, but definitely not this location.   On my visit here, it was about 10:30 a.m., with no traffic, at least not as busy as normal peak hours for breakfast/lunch.    Yet, they managed to take 15+ minutes to prepare a sandwich. I would like to add that by the looks as when I came into this establishment they had a full kitchen staff, as well as helping staff at the registers. Still they managed to take that long to make my sandwich, and I honestly think that they forgot my order, but they failed to recognize that, I asked the girl at the register, who by the way was insanely rude If she still had my order for, "The Perfect Storm" which was their special hot sandwich for the day, she said yes, but first asked me again for my name, as well as to remind her what I had ordered.     I then figured that she had forgotten my order, and I believe they did because the people behind me and those behind them after my order were getting called for their sandwiches and I was still there waiting.     I don't understand why they feel like they can take all the time they please to make a sandwich and then not even give a simple apology recognizing their mistake.  That apology would have made it much better, word of advice, just show a little more consideration next time please.    I was in no big rush, yet I could be doing better things with my time other than checking back on my sandwich order to make sure they didn't forget it. Then after all that mess the sandwich was not what  I expected it to be, way too much cheese and oil. Sorry not my style nor taste.  The board clearly advertised a Grilled Turkey, Melted Swiss Cheese, Sautéed Mushrooms & Red Bell Pepper, Tomato, Romaine Lettuce, Honey Mustard, and On a Toasted Baguette. Sounds tasty and healthy right, not the case for this baguette. * TOTAL Dissatisfaction *Terrible service by the girl at the register *Not up to par sandwich  -Good reasons why to never ever come back. - Oh and terrible tea!!

Bianco, Oh Bianco I had really high hopes for you.       I can't say I didn't like it, but I will say I don't love it, nor do I plan on ever going back. I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about. Bianco lacks customer service, size and comfort. The menu is limited and additions seem too costly for such small portions.       Needless to say, we ordered one pizza and that came down to exactly two slices each. Which still left us with traces of hunger after consuming the margherita with added sausage and mushrooms. To top it all off we felt like it lacked a certain kick, it was just too simple. A pizza too simple? Yeah, I'm not kidding. The service was sub-par, with a ditsy girl sitting us down and then a server that after taking our order, and bringing it over, was nowhere to be found after, we even had to ask a different server to bring us additional drinks.      Finally, the size, this place is cute but tiny, it gets uncomfortably busy and tight inside. I'm okay with closeness and all, but this was just too much that the table next to us kept dropping into our conversation. All we wanted was to enjoy our food and time there. Overall, It was a rather strange and unexpected experience .       Thankfully, we had The Rose and Crown a few steps away to unwind after such experience!!                                                            -See ya never Bianco.

I had almost forgotten this awesome Library existed!!! :) This library is like a walk down memory lane!! LOVE IT!! I used to come here a lot when I first got my library card. That was back when I was just 8 years old, oh the good times!!! :)  This library is so expansive and in great condition, yes its the building that stands right on top of the 101 tunnel. Oh and yes, you will occasionally bump into a homeless person or more who may be there to enjoy the nice A/C on these hot summer days, but no worries!! Their all mostly friendly and quiet. Plus, you wouldn't want to miss out on the massive selection this fine library has to offer!!   Enjoy!! :)

***** This place has always been AMAZING and close to my heart!!!  Everything from their food, the service and the ambiance!! It is always relaxing to come in to La Grande Orange both the grocery store and or pizzeria.  It has a very nice uniqueness to it as well as a very tasteful satisfaction.       As for our meal my boyfriend and I had their amazingly minty Cesar salad to start, then their exquisite ceviche and to end the MUST, The Rocket Man pizza!! lets not forget their fruity sangria!! VERY YUMMY!!! Oh and yes everything was GREAT!!! :)     Honestly, last night was my best visit so far, we got to sample their complimentary wine tasting and this to us was a perfect touch for our night!!!     La Grande Orange is simply as best as AZ gets, so experience it yourself and thank me later!!! :)

Oh Vig, you simply sucked!!!   Such a waste of time and money. The food and service here was awful, all except for the girl at the door the night we were there, which was on February 16th she was pretty nice. She was they only exception though, the guy at the bar was such a flirt, but in a very uncomfortable way. Then after waiting for our party at the bar we decided to move to a table and enjoy our drinks there. Then we come to realize that our server was a real stuck up and rude girl, that was nowhere to be found when needed and that took forever to come back to our table for assistance or further request! I don't think that's acceptable, we had to get other servers attention to get things for our table. Then after all that hassle, we stumble upon the nastiest nachos ever and okay drinks and wine, this was just plain awful and not worthy of your time nor mine!! Never again, never again!!!!!

Very easy hike, highly recommended for beginners!!!  Trail is paved and loops around the widely shaped mountain. Incredible views at night, the only complaint is the lack of better and closer parking, The parking adjacent to the mountain is limited to about eight spaces, with not so close parking near by!  Other than that small bump, this mountain is great!!! :)

This place was great!! As soon as you step in through the door you get indulged by all the wonderful BBQ smells and you also hear how others' in their table are cooking up their own meats and veggies!! What a great little spot it is!! I highly recommend it to all those BBQ lovers and Panda express fans!! This is much better and healthier too!!  It was a good full that we got after consuming all our food and not a fatty full!!

Most delicious Cupcakes I've had in the state of Arizona!!! An amazing morning bun too!! It's all organic and an ever so fresh delight!! Not only cupcakes, they also offer cookies, morning buns and cakes plus more! On top of that, they were winners on Cupcake Wars, how legit is that??!!  Truly legit,  that's right!!!  Another wonderful insight on this bake shop is that their incredibly community driven by supporting local charities, they support local organizations and are family owned and for the most part family operated too!!      Amazing!! Not too many of those around!! But truly try for yourself, this place is so amazingly great and delicious!! Forget about any sort of diet and indulge yourself on a cupcake or an ever so great morning bun!! YUM!!!!  You will never regret it!! Thank me later :)

If I ever need my bank account, I frequent this branch!! This nicely hidden location is located inside Fry's Marketplace and stays open for an additional hour than the free standing branches. So that comes out helpful after work hours with any of my random bank needs, plus the BEST thing is that I have always been treated with respect and have been given genuine help.    However this is a super busy branch, so come in with time and patience, but then again all other in-store Banks are extremely busy too!   I've noticed lately that they keep their lobby attended with someone who helps out the line and guides those who need help. I found this to be a great way of acknowledging when I come in, and help for other that may be new to this location, plus they informed me that I can now book appointments to see my personal banker, and thats great to book when I'm at they office, or on the go!    Overall, I see happy faces and helpful associates at all times. For a bank this busy that's very much appreciated and acknowledged each and every time! :)  I'm so happy to bank with them and have them cover my banking needs since I was 17!! :)

This was my very first time to a Pei Wei, I was excited to try them out. The wonderful and strong smells that wrap around your nose as soon as you step in to the place, cause some form of excitement in your stomach for the food that awaits. But, in all honesty Pei Wei left me wanting more, more flavors, more spices, and better textures. It was not as good as I had expected it to be, and I had high hopes for it, since my former co-worker had been raving on how good the food was from this place. I will tell you that the lettuce wraps were good, and I think the best thing I had from them that day, I also had some of the spicy orange chicken and that lacked flavor and chicken, It felt like I was eating a ball of dough, covered with sauce and with the minimal amount of chicken on it, and the pork egg roll, was not that tasty neither was the fried rice. I know others may love it, but It was simply not for me!  Thanks anyways, it's not you Pei, It's me!! :)

The Torta de Milanesa was good. Not the best, but decent. I also had a bite of my friends Torta Cubana and that was good, slightly better than my milanesa. My torta de milanesa had beans and no-where else have I ever had beans in a torta, atleast never in Mexico, place where the torta is king. But this might just be a filling replacing the standard avocado added to tortas de milanesa. Since I noticed that my torta lacked that and the avocado always gives it that extra creamy and tasty kick!!          Also, my standards are high for tortas. I've been lucky enough to enjoy tortas de Milanesa and Cubanas in Currnavaca and Mexico City by Tortas Che and others there!! Those are bomb!!! ANYWAYS!!          The tortas here are not bad, their simply good, but nothing that I would frequent nor crave. The service here was fantastic!!!! No complaints there, we were getting attention left and right, nothing overwhelming, just accommodating and super attentive.         The ONE THING I did love from this place was the Fresas con Crema!! Those were AMAZING!!! That is the reason why I came here in the first place. One of my friends had these exact Fresas con Crema at his place and he shared some with me to try and the Fresas con Crema and I fell in love ever since!!  OH YOU SWEET, SWEET, FRESAS CON CREMA with pieces of pecans!! :) You rock my taste buds!! :)       Yours truly,            Lizeth M. :)

Also when I feel like snacking I stop by their Auntie Anne's for some Pretzel Nuggets with hot salsa cheese!! Oh soo good, but bad!! Very bad, like I said only when I feel like snacking!! Overall I love their Macy's!!!

The food was good, the vibe was also good.  ** Except there was a very unfriendly older lady taking my order. She seemed a bit annoyed and was just not pleasant nor warm. *** However, I will give it a second try at their Frank Lloyd Wright Location soon!!!.  Hopefully they'll be a bit more friendly there!!! I've heard wonderful things about this restaurant from co-workers, so I wouldn't want to give up just because I had a not-so delightful first impression.  :)

- I was there March 16th.        This coffee shop is AMAZING, i love the vibe, the artwork, their freshness, and of course their cookies!!      I have already been raving to my friends how good this place is, and how we need to frequent coffee shops like this kind more often, instead of our usual Starbucks.       The service is outstanding, as I walked to the counter I was greeted by the cashier and I bluntly told him that it was my first time there and that I was taking their Chai as well as a pastry, but I didn't know which one. He then started telling me that their pastries are freshly baked each morning at their downtown location, and that he suggested the Chocolate Chip cookie as it was his own Fav!! So I told him, You had me at freshly baked, I'll take your chocolate chip coffee and a Medium non-fat Chai. The only thing was that they didn't have medium sized drinks, they only have small or large, small is just too little for me and large is just too much, medium is just perfect for me, but no medium and I end up not drinking it all. So I took the large and as expected, I wasted about 1/6 of my deliciously large hot  foamy non-fat Chai!!! :)      I will surely be back to frequent this spot, everyone there was oh soo friendly!! :)

Macy's, Oh Macy's!!!    How great you are, I love coming here for the sales and the amazing service. They already know me by name, it's that bad I know.I shop often at this specific location inside PV Mall. I love the amazing service provided at the shoe department by both Michael and also ANDY!!!  When there on the clock they are there to always help and they do it with a great deal of charisma!!!     I love the great sense of humor they both have, they all do, but those two specifically!! Andy always makes me smile with his fabulous attitude!!  This place is the place to come for awesome deals and great service!

Most horrible experience ever! I have been to this Macy's several times and for the first time ever, I have experienced a disrespectful experience and out of the normal Macy's Experience. Chris at the Home and Bath department at this Paradise Valley location, walked away after she asked me to wait for her. She knew I needed to know whether the Macy's at Fashion Square had the item I needed, since it wasn't available at this location, and she told me to call them. Instead of providing the option of giving me their number or checking the stock or calling them for me. This is the first time, and worst time I have had at this Macy's.

All I have to say is, that I cannot wait to have children and bring them to this wonderful place!!! Extremely kid friendly and Adult friendly too!!  Have fun!! :)

We have been here twice now, and both times were great, A++!!!   On our first visit we just ordered two orders of the Spicy California rolls, then on our second visit, we ordered two orders of their avocado rolls, which by the way are only like $3 for 6 pieces, and one order of the spicy California roll, with also an order of their Teriyaki chicken with white rice and four small veggie sides.  *** The food was good, but I think what keeps us wanting to come here is the wonderful customer service, they have been AWESOME to us,  we were greeted with an honest smile and we were well taken care of during our entire dining experience there!!!  There is a really sweet and kind guy and girl that work at the register too, they are both extra awesome!! We will keep coming for more, hopefully to slowly but surely try-out there entire menu, eventually!!!

I prefer this over a cake anytime for my birthday, and everyone who knows me knows this is very true!!!  I have been in love with nothing bundt cakes for over two years now!!!  Best bundt cakes ever, they are super moist and tasty!!!

Great Service, Clean rooms and within walking distance to every main attraction in Vegas!!    The great experience was mainly thanks to the service that Philip provided us. Philip went above and beyond from what we expected!! He was not your typical front desk associate! He guide us as to where to go, when and how!!! :) He was very professional, yet friendly! He provided a sweet and short intro on the grounds and surroundings and even managed to fulfill our request of a high floor!    This is the kind of service you would expect to get from a 5 Start Resort and are looking like money!  If you stay at this place you will experience what I am talking about! I cannot emphasis enough how impressed I was with Philips hospitality, and it wasn't just him our housekeeping was also very efficient and friendly when we requested the sofa bed to be turned down and more extra towels!!  Thank you to everyone that made our stay as pleasant and one of a kind!!  Will definitely come back and recommend  to close others!! :)  - Thank you Philip and all!!!

This Mountain has been a great backup plan since Camelback Mountain is closed until the end of Fall. I know, how lame of CAMELBACK!! :( But honestly, this Mountain does the job. It's tranquil and beautiful. It's a great place to get away from it all and just relax with a walk around and up the Mountain, or even a nice jog. The only thing I do want to warn you about is snakes. BE CAREFUL, we came across a striped orange and black snake, nothing too scary looking, more of a cute, large colorful reptile. But still, watch out and bring water bottles since its slowly starting to heat up out there!!!  Oh and I can't wait to try out the bike trails!! FUN!!!

I've had the pleasure to visit this place about three times now, and It hasn't disappointed me at all.  Firstly, amazing colors through out the place, such lovely and joyful decor. Secondly, what freakingly amazing tacos!! The cochinita pibil is one of my ultimate faves, with the carne asada very close to a tie!! Thirdly, the cocktails!! Oh my! The muy buena Paloma Cocktail!!!  But seriously, this place is great, I cannot emphasize enough how terrific this cafe is. I really adore and admire Gallo's style and taste in food, it's truly amazing, and closer to the actual modern food in Mexico, at least very similar to the South Central style.  You won't see the overplayed cheese and beans plate here, no sir!  That's what makes me love them more, how they steer more into the actual True Mexican dishes, with a bit of a slight twist but still about the same in extraordinary flavors.

- We were there for St. Patty's Day, March 17th       I was introduced to this nicely hidden spot by my best amiga Ly, she suggested their food for our St. Patty's celebration. We had for starters the rolls with the Romaine lettuce and they were pretty tasty after we added some of their hot sauce, and ultra hot as in temperature, both myself and Chris burnt ourselves, but that was our own fault, yes it was funny :) .      The Chicken Pho (Fauh) was great, hot, minty rich flavor and the noodles were well cooked too!!! Such BIG portions though, neither Ly nor myself finished our bowls. But they were OH SOO Delicious.        Thanks for the amazing meal and great time!!

Super nice staff!! I get the Groupon every time and I am always happy with the results!! :) Please tip accordingly, or don't get service done if you don't plan to tip. Wash your own car then!! It always bugs me when people walkout with their nose up in the air and no tip!! Go hide under a rock instead!!

It's Thanksgiving and all I was hoping to get out of my visit at Total Wine was grabbing a Sweet white wine and some Vodka for our Thanksgiving dinner drinks.    However, what I ended up getting was Eric, the most unhappy and disrespectful individual I have ever encountered. I came in asking for a, fruity white wine and he yells out to another "wine expert" where to find "fruity white wine" you would think that with the title of Assistant Manager on his name badge that he would have known where to find such small request and instead asked someone else. I then told him that D'Asti is more than fine, he then says "then you should have said that" and then continues to argue and say, "you should have said moscato" and I told the other wine expert to please take me to the where the D'Asti was. Then ERIC, the ASSISTANT MANAGER goes on saying, GET OUT OF MY STORE. I told him stop being rude it's Thanksgiving. He said get out, get out of my store. I then reacted and said shut up and he yelled at me, know you get out. I asked for the manager and he said I am the Manager. Then I decided to just go, I had a turkey in the oven and I was just there to grab-and-go and instead I was yelled at and walked out. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Even worst was the fact that he had the decency to tell me to go complaint online as he was walking me out. I will write to corporate and find a new place close by for wine, even if it's further away.

Awesome service and amazing Red Velvet flavor!! Yummmy!! :) PLUS!! You get a free bowl when you check in with Yelp, up to five dollars worth, how AMAZING is that???!!!  Very, very Amazing!!  The girl there was super nice and informative, she mentioned that its locally owned and they only Aloha Yogurt in Arizona.  Not only is it amazing on its own for being locally owned, but the flavors,oh how deliciously addicting. I could not stop eating from my bowl, the Ghirardelli Chocolate, Raspberry, Oreo cookie and of course, the amazing RED VELVET were all so satisfying!!! They were all truly perfect and delightful, and even better when paired with the right toppings, like the mango, for the raspberry, and the oreo dust for the chocolate and Oreo cookie flavor!!  So for the next time that I find myself around this area, I will not hesitate to stop by Aloha to again experience the most AMAZING FROZEN YOGURT Tempe has to offer!! :)

First time here, but service is okay so far. :| I  actually had Awful customer service, my dad suggested to take my car elsewhere for new brake pads on my front side. This other shop that I went to instead was much more friendlier and they did a fantastic job too in exchanging my brakes pads!!  # Oh and I just got a text message from Brake Masters today and found that to be annoying since ( A.)  I didn't take their services and (B.) I did not check off the box that agreed to accepting emails!! How rude!!!!!!!!!!! :(

Oh my this is such a great little hidden gem of a place!! We came here today to enjoy their happy hour, we are always looking for good little happy hour spots to renew ourselves after not so joyous days, Woo-hoo!! :) Boy it WAS definitely Feliz (Happy) hour for us!!! :)         The mojitos were oh so Delicious and just $7/each. While the Cali and spicy tuna rolls were just $3.95/each!!!  Talk about YAY and WOW!!! But wait there is more, they also offer scrumptious shrimp tempura rolls for just $5.95, What a steal right??       WHY ask for more!! Well, okay we did too, so we had the Pad Thai, which was great with a load of yummy flavorful noodles and chicken along with a small portion of veggies, we also ordered their Chicken Yellow Curry, that was rich and creamy and ever so satisfying!!       This place is soooo AWESOME that they even have a scale of hotness for their plates 1-5, 5 being the hottest, PLUS for those whom prefer their food super hot and spicy they also have the Thai 7, which is their absolute hottest. I myself settled for a 4, and that surprisingly was hot enough, yet edible and just right for me!!  Even after consuming all of our food that we knew and felt was colossal, we experienced a HAPPY FULL and not a GREASY FATTY FULL. Finally, we had a great time and the service was FANTASTIC as well as the food!! We truly enjoyed ourselves here, the vibe was just right and the people there were ever so nice. You deserve a High-five!!                      - Narai, you will be seeing our hungry faces more often!!                                                  Thank you new friends!!! :)

Oh my Ahi Tacos!!!  They were OH SO Delicious!!  They had the right textures and flavors going on, and at first these tacos seem tiny, but they are such joy and goodness that even that small of a portion is packed of greatness!! It settles so well!! :)  The service was great!! We had two very lovely ladies help us, on what seemed to be a busy Wednesday afternoon/ Happy Hour. Our server was genuinely suggestive and sweet!  The four stars is just due to the surplus of employees that were just wondering around our tables, (mostly guys) that looked over and walked around looking bored kinda distracting when your having a conversation and enjoying food!  Other than that, this place is great!!

This Vig used to be a BofA hiring center!!  What a turn-over wonder!! :) I must mention that I had a bad experience at the Vig Arcadia, and promised not to step foot into that place again.  However this location turned my experience with The Vig around, I came her on a Friday night to a co-workers birthday celebration! Those you can't say no to, so I came here thinking I would just sip water through out the night, but no siree. I really enjoyed the vibe, the music and the staff was ever so nice and friendly. Plus the food was delicious, I had some of the cheesy tater tots, YUM!! As well as one of their Hot Vings, wow were those sticky and spicy, but good!  Also just half of a Hot Chick sandwich and an Arnold Palmer!! Oh so delicious!!!  I was really glad I came and that this place took me by surprise!! The food was great and the staff here was just as good!! Great time with the co-workers and friends!! :)

This place is so fresh and so green green!!! :)    I loved my chicken wrap, to bad their so close to my official work place or else I would eat this over Jimmy John's and Subway any day!! This time I was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy!!   How lucky was I, I had heard of this place from an old classmate from Tempe, he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness, plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections!!  I truly loved the flavors in my wrap, so full and bold, I was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end!!  Way to go ZK Bistro!!!!!! You rock!!! :) I look forward to coming here more often!!

Now that it's starting to get hot outside I get the burning desire to swim, eat and drink!! All an amazing combination when in order!! The Sandbar brings that sensation to life, well... sort of!!  I love the misters they have for their patio and that's the sole reason why I agree to sit outside. I also love the sand layout they have with the illusion of a small body of water that to resemble a pool. So that touch is nice!! I also like the happy, upbeat service they offer!  This place has always been super friendly!!  As for the food, that is simply okay. Nothing to go crazy for, nor brag about. However, I will say that this place is a good spot to relax and enjoy a good time, and that's easy to do since It has a very joyful decor, and party feel to it!!  :)  Hope you enjoy it!!!

Oh my GOODNESS!!!  This place is a hidden treasure, it's so secretly tucked inside this very quiet plaza. So make sure not to miss it!!  I became acquainted with this sweet bakery after getting a fruit tart from a good friends.  So I decided after having such sweet treat, I had to share some of this goodness with others, and who better than my family?!  That is why I decided to order a full size fruit tart and have it decorated in honor of my brother's graduation!! It was great!! My brother really liked it, and so did the rest of my family. This fruit tart looked too good to eat, but we finished it anyways!!  I also wanted to mention that the baker is a real charm, he is passionate about what he does and will gladly educate you on the variety of delicious looking pastries he has. We had the luck of trying the oh so colorful macaroons, éclairs, tiramisu, Pecan tarts and a custard dessert.                             It was all fabulously great!!!!

JoBot is the spot to go for a nice cold Chai or Iced Chamomile Tea at any time, literally their open twenty-four-seven. This place is soo uniquely cool. I like it!! Oh and they even have a cool little piano inside!! Mad nice!!  It's weird how I get a look like, " What's this girl doing here?!" almost every time I come here. It's more FUNNY, than upsetting!! :)  No worries, I guess I'm not their usual clientele. Oh well, they'll get use to it eventually! It might be the bright colors I sometimes frequently wear, who knows?!.

Lovely night!!!  Perfect weather outside now, and you have the option of inside the cafe or outside in their lovely patio!!  We picked the patio area, open aired, and not noisy at all, being that it's close to the street. Great customer service!! A++ _ Delicious food, we ordered the Mango Shrimp!! Oh soo delightful with well proportioned mango squares, avocado, cilantro and lime!!! YUM!!  ** Oh and we also went with the Tuesday special, which was Bruschetta and your pick of Wine, for the Bruschetta, you can pick three and we chose, the Fresh Mozzarella + Basil + Tomato, also the Brie + Apples + Honey and the famous Prosciutto + Mascarpone + Figs + Honey!!! OH SOO YUM!! An explosion of full flavors inside your mouth, everything from sweet to sour!!!  :)  What a Great Combo, as for wine, we went with their ever soo fruity New Age, Torrentes!! Which was indeed a great pick!!!  Fully satisfied!!! :)

Great pizza!! This place was a great last minute pick!!  We decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! The service was great!! We had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. Also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! Everything was amazing!! The Mozzarella appetizers and the Extreme Hot wings!! Oh so good, fatty food!! We look forward to coming back!!

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Amazing food, great and beautiful people all over this place, a server with the same Birthday as mine! What else could I possibly ask for??! Lovely inside or patio seating. Great mix of dishes and drinks! LOVE the Polish fix as a refreshing unwinding drink!!! Try the rock shrimp w/ shishito peppers or the Pretzel bits with fondue for your appetizer! Yum Yum!!! Nom nom!!  Oh and the Cubano, and especially the Turkey Pastrami are a must for lunch!!  Bon appétit!!!!

I am a Teriyaki chicken lover, so this is the spot to go to if your just simply craving some traditional teriyaki with rice bowl or plate. I almost always get the Teriyaki with the steamed Veggies and white rice!! We also truly enjoy their avocado rolls and California rolls, they are both much fuller and cleaner cut, then other places. **** Also the service was nice, overall it is good.

Just okay for my taste, the one thing I do like is that you can go crazy with what you decide you want to have them cook up for ya!!  You simply, pick your choice of meat, choice of seasoning, veggies, sauce and starch and you hand it over to the cook, that then they heat it up for you in their gigantic grill and TA DA, it is all ready for you to enjoy!! The one thing that I honestly don't really like is the price, it could definitely be adjusted, it is a bit over-priced for the portioned you get and that is without a drink, if they included your drink of choice then I would then be content!!

Good Pizza and great service!! The date dinner for two special is great for its value, available on Thursdays after 6:00 pm!!!  It included an entree, two salads and one pizza of your choice!!!  Enough food for two!!! :) The garlic french fries were bomb!!!! Deliciously seasoned. As for our friend, the birthday boy, he had pepperoni pizza and that by itself was great, better than our BBQ Chicken pizza I would say!!  Fun place, great service, AWESOME YOUNG MAN SERVING!!! :) We came here with a group of 12 and were seated urgently and smoothly!! :) Oh and the Pomegranate Martini was Oh soo Great!!! A must try, a bit strong, but that's how I like them!! :)

*****Great breakfast spot on Mill!! :)  I had one of their hot sandwiches the FOCACCIA ROMA-CHICKEN, cut up grilled chicken breast pieces, tomato, gooey melted provolone cheese, light mayo on a cheesy Focaccia bread with added minced jalapenos and lettuce to mine!!  It was delicious!! I also ordered my favorite drink the Caramel Macchiato, but instead they mistakenly made me a caramel latte which was still as good as a Caramel Macchiato. Overall, the service was great and so was my sandwich and drink!!     *I will surely be back!! :)

- We were there Tuesday March 13th.        This bakery was just Okay, not so satisfying. My advise is keep on walking to the next one.       I will not come back that's for sure. I feel like because we had our backpacks on, we were treated less than the business people that were coming in. Like Hello?? Our money is just as worthy, so please show a little more attentiveness and care next time!! To other backpackers that is, because WE won't go back!!         Also the food was just okay it seems like they have more pastas and sandwiches than baked items, besides our turkey sandwiches lacked flavor or something. It could have been better overall, waste of time and money.

I honestly really like this place!!  I get it!!  It's mostly because I get this sweet Groupon deal, movie and drink for just $6, GET OUT OF HERE!!  No, but seriously, this place is small and quaint, but very accommodating with comfy recyclable chairs and a bar for those who like a little drink with entertainment. They also offer other meal options, like burgers and stuff. I also noticed that Groupon has it for $5, for the solo movie pass, but that is still a pretty good deal that is worth the visit!! So instead of complaining about this hot Summer weather, go enjoy a good movie, in this air conditioned and food accommodating theater, that is if you haven't already! :)  Enjoy!!

Zoyo!! I love the name!!!! :)   Such a great open patio from this spot , ignore the traffic from McDowell Rd. and just unload with the yummy sensation of great tasting frozen yogurt! Plus, they include toppings that the Tatum and Shea Bldv. location lack!! (e.g. Lechera and peanut butter!!)  Yum!!  Crazy good, but with moderation it's a no harm delight!! :)

I love the MU!! :)   You'll always find someone or something to do. Favorite spots include, the fireplace right by the Changemaker. It's my favorite spot for studying every morning before class and Its perfect, since its quiet and usually just about half full. My second favorite spot is right by Starbucks and that area gets packed up quickly so grab the first table you see, thirdly the outside patio.  My only suggestion would be to add healthier options. So far my top and truly only choices include, AFC Sushi, Extreme Pita and Subway.  Other options here are, Burger King, Papa Johns, Chick-fil-A, but those are pretty lame and insanely high in energy intake.

*Simply the greatest Pad Thai I've had so far!!!* **** It was FANTASTIC!! Also the Thai BBQ Chicken was delicious with steam brown rice and veggies. The BBQ Chicken breast just need a bit more flavor, they seemed a bit dry and maybe even over cooked, other than that the service was great and the place looks wonderful inside. I loved the colors!! **** See ya again soon!! :)

Great service each and every time!!       This place is great when you need to, make changes to your account, have a cashier's check issued or simply need a large or out of the ordinary withdrawal. The service is great, which makes up for their understaffed team. Everyone and the manager have a great attitude and are very willing to help. Not the bank I frequent, but definitely helpful since its the closest to home!!

Brat Haus, It's been a while but I remember clearly how amazing the staff was!!!  We got to this establishment, very close to closing time and we were still treated very well. I didn't get to eat much here, I just had a drink, a few french fries and about half of a beer brat with the hot peppers ( I gave the other half to my friend, guys will eat just about anything). That was all delicious, and even better with the special treatment as my small group and I enjoyed the fireplace in the back patio along with a fine game of Jenga, we were practically the only one's left by that time.  It was all super swell!! :)  Thanks again Brat Haus, I must come back some chill day to try out that pretzel with queso fundido!! Sounds delish!! :)

I came here by myself on a Thursday during happy hour, since sadly none of my, "friends" had the time or desire to join me!! :(  Well, they missed out!!! This place is perky, colorful and clean. I had the chicken tacos from the HH Menu as well as a Prickly Pear Mojito and that was spectacular, and to top it all off I indulged myself with a Milk Chocolate Tres Leches Cake. and that was just okay!!! I've made and had way better ones'!!!   Overall, great little place. and hopefully next time I will bring someone along!!!  My server was great, She was very attentive and well knowledged on the menu items!!! Great place!! ***   You deserve an A++  :)

No matter what others may say about you Lustre, I will always like you!!! :)  I like this bar, and it's not because of the drinks, food or music all that much, but mostly because of its pool and rooftop view!! Supa Supa AWESOME view!!   I love night lights, so I go ga-ga for views like the one Lustre offers! Oh so breathtaking and almost unobstructed.  The service can be a little slow and at times nowhere to be found, but overall this spot is the spot to go to when in DT Phoenix with a group of crazy good friends!! :)  Have fun!!

Gotta love first Fridays!!  The people watching, options for food, entertainment and art.  Everything is fine and dandy, except for the guy on the photo loaded, his lack of respect. Please don't act like you have a stick up your behind for creating some "art".  Be modest trick! Be modest and show some respect. :)

***** ___ This Vitamin Shop is OUTSTANDING, they offer quality products and of course, GREAT customer service. Trust me, I have been coming to this Vitamin Shop for a little over a year, and I love it!!! They offer a wide selection on Healthy Products, like energy bars, Immune boosting supplements, and overall total body health care items. *** The reason why I am overly attracted to come here is their JUICE BAR!!!  ******************IT'S AMAZING!!***************************** YOU MUST try it out yourself, I love their LAOS Smoothie, it tastes like paradise!! Plus its healthy, and under 200 calories for a 24oz cup. Oh and another plus to the smoothie is it's low, low price!! It's only $3.50 for the greatness in taste and energy!!  **** You must try this place yourself!!!!! MUST :) Trust me, you will not regret it!!!

Simple, yet to the point kind of gym!!  Great front desk, staff is always there and ready for check-in. This place is always clean and well stocked, it also has a good selection of work-out equipment, inexpensive membership and its open twenty-four-seven, for those late night gym junkies!! :) Not much more I can say, only four stars for lack of pool!! :)

Oh my I spotted this bad boy at the Tempe Campus right in between of the Apache Parking Structure and the BAC Business Building!!  After seeing this truck parked there around 5:00pm till about 7:00pm I decided to pay them a visit and see what they had to offer. Boy was I glad I did, since they offered much healthier meal options then the MU does! Makes me and my tummy very happy.  They have delicious and quickly prepared bowls or sides! Top notch ingredients and flavors. For example, I went with their B.Y.O.B. (Build your own bowl) and selected the marinated stir-fry chicken, along with stir-fry veggies, white rice, spicy teriyaki sauce and a bit of their ninja dust, which was recommended for an added spicy kick. Oh my, it was OH SO GOOD and healthy too!! So I was glad I decided to try them out!  The service was super sweet and friendly! Great experience!! High five to that and a well deserved A++  I will be paying them more visits I'm sure!! :)

Amazing light show, great time for those fascinated with Christmas lights and animals!!  I loved the light show they offered in the center of the pond. Lights dancing to the rhythm of the music, amazing!! Highly reccommended to those with kids or young siblings!! Would make a great family time!!

I have visited this Dutch Bros. Spot twice now, and for both times they offered magnificent service and muy delicious drinks!! I don't know but the people working here seem to be high on life/energy/happiness or something good, which is contagious when they greet you and ask you ever so kindly what you'd like to order. Also don't let the drive-through fool you, you may also have the option of parking and enjoying your drink right there and then.  I hope to visit them more often now that I found a drink there I truly enjoy, the caramelizer!!  Which by the way is awesome when hot and with 2% milk, I usually do nonfat but this drink is worth enjoying to the fullest or else It will not taste the same, full body goodness of caramel, coffee and silky sweetness!

OH MY!!!   I LOVE NOTHING BUNDT CAKES AND THEIR AMAZING CARROT, RED VELVET, ALMOND POPPYSEED, PECAN PRALINE CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHIP AND ALL OTHERS!!  This is by far my favorite location for these Baked bundles of Joy too!! After having a few sour encounters at their Scottsdale and Frank Lloyd Wright location. I decided it was time to change locations and this one is not only closer, but much nicer. The service here is great each and every time.  All of the young girls that have helped me here have been super nice!! :)  I love this spot and always order online or by phone to guarantee the cakes and also sometimes just stop by for a tiny Bundlet!! :)

Amazing Happy Hour deals!!!      Great appetizers and drinks, this place is tucked away between a Whataburger and furniture store. Place is small, but very well decorated! They even had a guitar player on the second floor who played nice and calming songs during happy hour!  Nice!! :)  Not very much to say since we only came here to try out their happy hour, and all of the appetizers we ordered were great!! Especially the Queso Fundido, that was delicious!!! Yum and the nice long list of drinks!! The bartender that night mixed up some delicious cocktails too!!  I definitely will come here again to try out the full menu soon!

_ Randy Abdin is one of the best Real Estate Specialist that I had the honor to work with, and I had gone through alot of other agents that were just a waste of time, pushing me to see homes that were nowhere close to the description of what I had described initially!!      Randy Abdin had the patience, professionalism and drive to help and successfully find my new home!!!!!  *Time after time, I would tell him what I wanted and I was super picky, as a First Time Home Buyer, as well as a single home buyer. He was of great help during they entire home buying process/experience, and believe me it was a bit stressful at times, with the gathering of paper work, making time for the home showings, making offers to preferred homes, looking at short-sales, the whole thing. I had this experience a while, while back in about February of 2010 was the start of it and I thankfully had the luck of closing on a home that I really liked, this was in May 21, 2010 and I am proud to say still gladly satisfied with. The process was smooth, easy, as well organized.     * * * Randy always went above and beyond with what I needed, helping me find the perfect Broker and best deal!! I am eternally thankful and so is my family, since he had also helped my family on our previous home purchase years before!!         I had no other way of showing all my gratitude than providing him a basket full of cookies for all his dedicated hard work, he is a truly great person and Real Estate Specialist and I would recommend him in a heart beat.                                                                *** Best of Luck!!!!!!

The Stand is simply delicious!!!! They will hook you up with amazing tacos, impressive burgers and all natural fries. This place is a must visit!! The service is phenomenal, ever so friendly as well as informative!! This places delivers quality and value!! My favorite is the Standard with cheese, it includes two house-ground patties offering crisp hand-leafed lettuce, fresh tomato, sliced onion, crinkle cut dill pickles, american cheese and their special stand sauce with added grilled jalapeño peppers. AMAZINGLY GREAT!! Oh and lets not forget the side of fresh cut fries and an iced cold Horchata.  SIMPLY PERFECT!! :)

This Starbucks is always a magnificent last minute Caramel Macchiato spot!! The lines here get crazy long, but don't let that stop you from getting your caffeine or tea dose!! There is always plenty of friendly and attentive staff at this spot, knowing that most students in line might be cranky and/or inpatient.  You can't say much about Starbucks, other than they pretty much have the queue and processing time management down!! Plus, they offer yummy treats, Ethos water, amazing green, passion and black tea, and a terrific Starbucks Gold Rewards Program!! :)            _   Way to go!!

I had been to this place a few times before!    Usually the service is good, but this time I experienced an awful time with Chelsea our waiter.    The Teriyaki Chicken here is great, but anything else is mediocre!  On my last visit to this place, I ordered the Fried Thai Rice, and that was the most disgusting pile of rice I have seen! The rice, was lumpy and flavorless, after not bearing to force myself to eat this gunk, I flagged our waitress down, Chelsea, and told her that as much as I tried liking that plate it was horrible and not Fried Thai rice!!! That it was steamed not fried, she argued back claiming that it's made that way, and then walked away shaking her head!! Talk about rude! Then the Chef came out to apologies, which was truly nice. He claimed that a trainee prepared my dish, and that it was made incorrectly, then brought over a plate he claimed to have prepared himself, it was just as flavorless, but without the funky balls of steamed rice and without water chestnuts, (they probably thought I didn't notice!).    Very neglecting and rude experience! I will never ever, come back to this place! Non-deserving of bringing in a lunch crowd, as I did before!!!

Awesome grooming, basic wash service included shampooing, blow drying, brushing, hair cutting from nose to toes, ear cleaning and nail trimming. Service was great, Andy used to be located at Barks n' Bows over by 32nd Street and Thunderbird. This is the new spot and name the business is under. My dogs were happily pampered after their visit here, they cheerfully walked out and were no longer shy and quiet as they first were when coming in to this new business spot!! I do also suggest to make a reservation.  I highly recommend this place and it's incredible prices for the service they provide.

Not my typical review!! But I definitely wanted to speak out on this Amazing Lawn Care provider!!  Okay, so I needed some work done to my lawn, The City of Phoenix sent me a complaint about the lack of care to my lawn and my super neglected palm trees. I then decided to look into what it would cost me to set up something nice on the front lawn and clear up the palm trees. I looked up on Angie's List and came across with this business. I called on a Wednesday afternoon during my lunch time and I informed them that I really needed this done by this weekend! They said they could even come over that same day on Wednesday to give me a free estimate and plan on what to do with my lawn. I was amazed at how soon they were able to come over to my place!!  They can over at 4:30 pm, they were super friendly, family owned and with fantastic ideas!! They were able to set up a nice flower bed by my homes entrance and also cleaned up the palms for what I thought was a steal of a price!! So efficient, colorful and clean!! I love to drive in and admire my now beautiful lawn and amazing colors as my photo shows!! I will definitely keep up my lawn through them and refer them to my parents and friends who may be in need of a lawn make-over!!! I love what they did!!!  Psssst ... (I am now thinking about getting some citrus trees planted, we shall see!!!) :)

Super fun trail to bring your little four legged friend on!!!  If you have a small to medium sized dog, I recommend this trail over Echo. I adore Echo, but that's more intense and rugged! But on this trail you'll spot such a diverse crowd, elderly peps, newbies, kids and small-large dogs. Not your typical Echo trail crowd.  Yet, it is fun and slightly challenging, but just a bit. :) OH and Views along this trail are breathtakingly-awesome!!  Happy Trails!!

Hey!! I am a huge coffee lover, and Tea Lover as well!!  For those Starbucks never lets me down with its delicious Caramel Macchiato to its iced Green Tea Lemonade. It all starts with their top notch service, that for the most part is always consistent.  This Starbucks location is one of my favorite ones, I must share! Since not only do I pick my refreshing GreenTea Lemonade on the go, but I also notice that this in-store location carries with it a lot of sales from time to time. I get to purchase most of my cups and tumblers from this location, plus great service from Susan, their barista!! Thanks for the refreshing hydration!! :)

The worst service!! It's either a bad attitude or a lack of urgency!! I mentioned it to the supervisor and no change. Only reason why I was coming here was the convenience and Drive-thru. This is just another example of why you need to avoid chains, they think they can do whatever and you'll still be inclined to purchase their product.

This place is my new Favorite!!! From the all Natural Purple rice, it's freshness and also Great Service!!!! :)    Not only do you get a Miso Soup and Edamame just by checking in, but you also get to enjoy some of the best sushi rolls this town has seen!! For our order we decided to get the Sex in the City roll, the H3 roll and the Arizona roll, all three of these were delicious, especially the H3 roll Yummy and fresh!!   Next, I will try the ramen!! We will see how that goes :)    I just wish they had a location close to home! Other than my lazy wishes, I love this place, the service, the freshness and their efficiency!! :) A must try for sure!!!! :)

Love the fish tacos here!! Also the carne asada as well as the Street corn! Yum!  I'm a super big fan of street tacos, and some good chips and salsa for starters, and this place has it all!! Must try if you haven't already!!  The only thing missing would be for them to have Horchata and Jamaica water!!! That would put them in my all time favorite after Gallo failed!! :) Enjoy!!!
