I have been to this car wash a few times now and am extremely disappointed at how this last experience went.  I talk with the attendant for 10 minutes and finally get talked into the fancy wax job ($130). After waiting an hour n a half I decide to walk over to the car to do a little inspection before they were finished to point out the missed areas.  Unfortunate enough I find a softball sized swirl scratch etched into my paint job right on the front end giving my car a perfect nose job (hard to miss).  I call the seemed to be owner (Asian guy) over and after 30 minutes of "talking" with him I got no more than "that didnt happen here" and "we don't put scratches in. We buff scratches out".  No ownership to this incident was taken and my respect for this establishment is entirely lost. This is a clear indication of how business there is run and if you decide to take your car don't expect it them to treat with care or take any liability for their negligence. NEVER going back

I went to a seminar here and as that didn't thrill me so much I made a move to the bar area to see what that was about.   Crafty drinks, nice conversational atmosphere, and the food was killer.  Highly recommend the guac! Nice and chunky so you could see it was just made in house.  I couldn't make my mind up on what burrito so I went with the tacos.  The plate comes with 3 so I went with the barbacoa and al pastor.. They load each one up with meat and the toppings are prime.  Ill definitely be back

Came here on a week night after seeing a picture of the burger.  I have to say it was as good if not better than what it looked like. Definitely the best burger on mill.  Highly recommend going when it's not so packed just to eat and grab some drinks

I'm a regular at chopshop on Scottsdale road and finally got in to the Tempe location.   Awesome atmosphere and great service. Not to mention the food and drink are always on par and a healthy alternative to pretty much anything else in the area.  Huge fan of there classic club sandwich and hear amazing things about their protein plates.   Perks: giant chess board, cool inside dining, and geographically desirable location   Tempe's #1 lunch spot
