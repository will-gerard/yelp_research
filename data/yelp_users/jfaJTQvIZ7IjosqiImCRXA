Great food, staff was nice, the place was clean. Definitely a nice place to eat out on a Sunday afternoon. I had mac and cheese, and a baked potato with everything on top, chives, sour cream, pulled pork,   cheese, and bbq sauce! I will go back in the future.

Well I just bought this Miata recently and I thought the doors were a different key, that I didn't have so I couldn't lock the doors. Well I went to get a couple of extra keys made because I only had the one key, but it only worked in the ignition and barely worked in the trunk, so i got a copy made. Went home and tried the new key in the doors it didn't work, so I pulled out my door lock cylinder because I know Miata's quite well. Brought the cylinder back an hour later and they made me two more keys based off of my door lock cylinder and gave me the necessary information so I could have more keys made in the future if need be. Now I have two good keys that work in both of the doors and the ignition and the trunk. I'm super happy with the work performed and the extra effort that was extended for beyond what I've seen from any locksmith in the past.   Thanks again definitely an honest business here, will come back!

Was already annoyed with my day. Was explaining it to the other two people in my party, eventually it turned into a rant.  The Restaurant was not very busy but there was a family seated behind us, well they asked to be moved over my loud voice, which is completely understandable. What killed it for me was the "talking to" I was given by some other waitress because the family had asked to be moved. 9pm on a Sunday and I can't speak my mind at the table, no. I couldn't have fathomed being more angry when I left than when I had came in.   How was food?  It was alright at best.  How was the service?  Slow as hell for how slow the restaurant was.  Did I leave a tip? Only because one of my party members is a server.   Will I go back? No  Will i recommend this location to anyone? No  The only lesson to be learned here is don't let another server talk to your table negatively, it could cost you your tip.

Had a great experience here recently. Was looking to have my computer fixed because I thought it had a virus, but it turned out to be some wonky setting in my windows 8. They fixed it for less than it takes to fill my Miata with gas and explained how to fix it next time so I won't need help. Thanks again!
