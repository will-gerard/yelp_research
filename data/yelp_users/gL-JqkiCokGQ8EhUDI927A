I dug the atmosphere and cheap PBR. I met up with a friend here and he was surprised by my suggestion because how the area is becoming so posh as of lately. He liked it and how laid back the bar is.  Its a cool, nice, small dive bar and a bartender was really nice and remembered what you ordered. Very cool

Very good food for what the price is. Nice service, very attentive. Elaine was very nice. First time I had fried pollock. The clam chowder was good but could have been hotter. The fries were good but the seasoning I could do without. But overall I was happy with the food. I would come back to try something different.

Not too impressed. Our server was kind of ignoring us while she paid attention to bigger tables. One server just took my brothers plate and didn't ask if he was finished. Plus, with charging $1 for each basket of chips (1st one free) you'd think it would be a bigger basket with better salsa.  Also our server would rush by and we would have to try to waive her down to order more. Only a few times she asked if we wanted another drink or more water.  Felt very negleted. I understand it's St paddy's day, but on that kind of a holiday, you would stress customer service and over staff  Especially with an all day concert up the road.

I went here on the 3rd day of Phx comicon. It was by accident since the restaurants i wanted to got to were closed on Saturdays.  i got the thai chicken salad, which was delicious and has a slight kick to it which was perfect. i was very pleased. Also we got a discount on our ticket because we had our badges from comicon on, so a discount is always a plus. I would definitely go there again. Prices are good and atmosphere is chill, especially if the one cool waitress plays cool music, not dance club music.
