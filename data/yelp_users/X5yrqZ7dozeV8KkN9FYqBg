I absolutely love this place! Beers are amazing there, the Piranha Pale Ale is definitively my favorite.  Food is also great, I tried several things on the menu and I never was disappointed. Their lunch specials are very good deals. Refill soups and salads.

Oh my god! This place is amazing! First of all you have to know that I am French. I enjoy American food but actually this place could be an upscale French restaurant.  Great place to bring a date if you don't mind to spend so much money, but actually it's worth it...  I had a beer, a great IPA, rotator from widmer brothers. Very nice.  Then we ordered some appetizers, some seafood, shrimps and crab and lobster plate. That was beautiful, fresh and the sauces with it were so good. I was already full after this but we had then one of their suggestion. A huge piece of beef for 2 with a very long bone. I can't remember its name. Sides : the corn and mashed potatoes with garlic. Insane. Great. We also had some onions, so tasty! Amazing! I was so full after this but I couldn't resist to try one of their desserts. I had the creme brûlée, and god it was perfect! I tried several times before but that one is the best I had in USA. Served with fresh berries.  And then, the coffee. You guys don't know what is a real espresso, I'm sorry to tell you this. But actually Flemings espresso is great! Oh and, I forgot the most important... The bread. They give you a big piece with sauces, blue cheese and a whipped butter. Oh my god this is the best bread I had in the area. Even if it's not as good as French baguette, that was pretty good.  I will go back to that place for sure, expensive one but worth it so bad!

Great place to get an amazing frozen yogurt ! You can make all you want, flavours change every week. Place very clean.   Staff is absolutely friendly, it's always a nice time when you go there.

I can't do less than 1 star. Terrible service. Who wants to be served by a guy chewing a gum in front of you? I don't. My boyfriend either.  The food is ok, drinks way too expensive. I could barely feel the tequila in my margarita. I have to say we didn't wait long for the food to arrive, but where was the Brie on my bruschetta? Couldn't feel a taste of it. Too bad.  I used to love this place, I brought some friends and had a blast.  Tonight is just the worst experience I have ever had. Won't come by again. For sure.

Well, I experienced this on a rainy day. Not the best choice, but... This place is amazing! The patio is beautiful, you can hear the birds talking and singing, which is pretty awesome!  I had -I don't remember how many- great beers, selection is absolutely insane.  Staff is very friendly and welcoming. We first sit outside, before the rain goes crazy. Then we moved inside, atmosphere was so nice.  I had the hummus, which is so good and very large for the price...  I absolutely love that place, I'll go again and again with my boyfriend or friends or family! Highly recommended!
