I just had lunch at Eliana's today and thanks to other Yelpers, steered my way to the combo appetizer platter [and ordered an extra papusa so my friend Jim and I could both have one] as well as the chicken and shrimp entree. Before I go any further, of note here is that this is peasant food, served in simple surroundings. Having said that, its simply delicious. Our food was served all at once and was accompanied by tortillas and refried beans. These are NOT your mother's refried beans. They have an unbelievably smooth texture and are full of amazing flavor. We dipped our tortilla's [which in this case are 1/2 inch thick masa harina-esque mixed with shortening - am guessing] in the beans and just revelled in the great mix of flavor and texture. Between that and our other fave, the papusa's, we could have died happy at that moment. The papusa's are everything everyone says they are: warm, delicious, with meat, potato and cheese. Must be El Salvadoran for 'comfort food'. Its simple, flavorful and delightful. Although I was less of a fan of the shrimp/chicken/rice entree, it was still very fine.   The servers were extremely kind and friendly and when we asked about the refried bean prep, we were basically given the 411 on how they prep the beans, what they cook them with and how they get the texture [blender]. It was a delicious and satisfying lunch. Plenty of food for $21 plus tip.

If I could give it a 4.5 I would. Not much not to be unhappy about here.   The Good:  Food was great. Fresh. Delicious. Served hot.   Lovely and I split the Chicken/Steak skewers. Delicious, perfect size served with a touch of sweet heat and ahhmazing peanut sauce. Meat was cooked to perfection. Presentation spot on.  The kitchen was out of salmon but the almond crusted talapia was deeevine. A very generous portion, cooked perfectly with a lovely light berry reduction and beautiful roasted baby carrots and sauteed haricots verts. It was served hot - right off the line hot, which I prefer to resting happily for too long...The Lovely had tenderloin accompanied by what tasted like a chipotle, cheddar mashed potato and a boat load of sauteed mushrooms that was yum and he had no trouble finishing.   We both had side salads - gorge and fresh mixed greens, on a cold plate no less - me with a balsamic vinaigrette served on the side that was perfect.   Since it had been loudly uttered by the Sweet One that it was my birthday, upon removing the entree dishes, the server presented me with warm chocolate torte and vanilla gelato full on with a candle. Decandent and delicious. And it was comped. Total yaydom for me and my birthday!   Wine choices are really fine. Me: Fess Parker Chard, The Boy: a Pinot Noir that I can't recall and therefore shant speak to. Chard was nice, crisp and not overly dry.   The Bad [or to be fair, Not So Very Good]:  We were seated at one of the smaller booths - a two seater. Which is cozy but across from the kitchen and the clang of dishes and next to a loud group of retirees discussing the new HBO series with Dustin Hoffman at full volume. Mmmmm, not so much.   Reservation had the wrong name. Not tragic but its not that difficult.   Seemed odd to be out of two entree selections at a 6PM seating on Sunday. But since one was fish, I forgive them. Sort of. That means they're buying very close to what they serve which = fresh.   The Ugly: Nada. Zero.   We'd go back. Its a nice spot with really good fresh food. Service was attentive and solid. Overall a really very fine experience.   Topped off with a gift of diamond earrings. How bad could it be??

We keep coming back! I love this place. The food is always so good and even when I ask the kitchen for the naked cheeseburger, they make it pretty. And its delish and I love me a cheeseburger. This last time I ordered a vodka tonic and asked the bartender to surprise me - either Belvedere or Ketel. Back came the most frosty delicious Belvedere vodka tonic. Perf. The lovely, as prefers, mans up to the filet. And is always happy, sipping his pinot alongside..   I just wanted to say, yum. And we'll keep coming back. Thanks PCG.

Oh happy day! Find me a service professional who is both professional and wonderful at service. They took in my upright Miele - which is like taking an appendage for a woman with children and animals - and told me it would be about a week. They called with a very reasonable estimate and voila, my treasured vacuum was in my possession exactly a week later, working like new.   Owners are husband-wife and could not have been nicer. Yay for ABC! Do I hear Michael Jackson and a dance coming on??? Sorry but these guys are great.

I'm a foodie. Spoiled rotten by years in NYC. I've been to Sophie's several times. If this review were based on my first visit, it would have been 5 stars. The pate starter is better-than-sex good and we decided that with the wine we chose, we could have just made a meal of it. It was just as good on return visits. The duck breast entree, is also a winner. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, served with a leek fondue that made me want to lick the plate [my mother raised me better]. The cassolet was redolent and rich. In a word: delightful. I dropped a star because during my last lunch there I had a turkey dish and it was clear it was old and leftover. Not a happy camper. I'm hoping it was a fluke because the rest of my experiences have been very positive. I've had great servers, have never been rushed, overall great.

Nothing bad to say about this resort. Service, grounds and accomodations are top notch. Had wedding #3 here [don't ask]  in one of the gardens. Food was fabulous as was the service and the cake!! I asked the kitchen to stock my cooler after the reception with milk shakes and sandwiches and they did just that; along with the leftover cake!  T Cooke's has never disappointed for client meals or romantic ones. Love this place. Love.

This review is for Alvadora - the spa at the Royal Palms. [cue angelic voices...**ahhhhhh**]   The lovely presented me with a spa gift cert for three services. When I arranged the appointment, I asked if I could increase the massage time from 60 to 90 minutes in lieu of the second service and was told 'of course'. So I booked a 90 minute stone massage and a pedicure.   The day of the appointment - my birthday - I was greeted with a 'happy birthday' and shown to the women's shower/changing/steam room. Its not fair to call it a locker room, its simply too lovely for that. There is a second 'relaxation room' where you can sip tea an enjoy small bites while you wait. Delightful.  As for the massage itself, may I just say that it was the most relaxing 90 minutes of my life?? It was one of those times where time goes by much more quickly than you want. I didn't want it to end. The room has a vaulted ceiling with what look to be the original beams. It has two tables and shower heads above each for the citrus scrubs [yikes did that sound sexy...] The woman [you can ask for gender preference if you like] who worked on me - Carol, I think - was great. I was kept warm the whole time either by her hands holding the smooth warm stones or by the perfect weight of the covers over the rest of me. I felt perfectly taken care of. My 5x operated shoulders have never felt so relaxed. I walked out of there and into the ahhhhmaaaazing not-locker room [stocked with everything - and I do mean everything - you might need, right down to qtips, shave cream and disposable razors] where an out of town guest asked me what I had done and she told me I looked stoned. All of that without drugs!! The showers, walk in and large enough for a family of 5, are similarly equipped with all of the spa products to use and enjoy. Lovely.   As an aside, I don't mean to short-change the pedi but I am a girl who has frequent pedi's, so this was less of a treat than the massage which I'm less likely to get for myself. It was pleasant, in a nice atmosphere but nothing seriously out of the ordinary. And sorry my lovely, but not worth 80+ dollars.   There are nooks outdoors - each with lounge chairs and fireplaces - where you can relax and unwind further. Or you can have lunch there with your book - which I did. Menu, lunch, it all comes to you quickly, sweetly, happily. Makes me wish I lived there. Its quiet and lovely and is a great match to the experience itself. The staff is kind and attentive and a dot on the i of the incredible experience.

The good: nice place, nice service. nice experience.  As all have mentioned before, interesting and delicious wine selections and bruschetta to die for [I am a fan of the proscuitto/fig/marscarpone and the smoked salmon]. Knowledgeable and friendly staff.   The bad: okay, the not-so-good...hideous parking [but there's a $3 valet] and really loud. Interesting vibe and a mixed crowd. Would bet its great when the weather cools down and patio seating is more appealing that the current August sauna.   All in all, I'd go back, eat. drink. eat some more.

These guys rock my world! They've done two kitchens of mine, one upscale stainless, the other more downscale white. Major love. Knowledgeable, helpful, reasonable prices. They deliver, they install, they refer reliable repair services. They rock.

Top rated on Angies List, I called both locations to have someone come out and look at our fireplace for a gas insert. Haven't received a call back from anyone more than a week later. Hard to believe that their sales people are so busy they can't call back to schedule an appointment. Boo. Moving on...

These guys are the best. NEVER more than a few minutes wait to be seen and as others have said, both Dr. Salek is patient and kind and will take as much time as you need to answer questions for either parent or child.   We've been going to the Mesa office for years and just recently had to call on a Sunday. The answering service was similarly kind and Dr. Ciminello called back in less than a minute, was thoughtful, generous and patient. Put my mind at ease and was great. Every thing you'd want for your child. Yay for the awesomeness that is Pueblo Peds!!

Um. No.   One star for the the lovely's filet, he said it was one of the best he's had. Second star for service and the chocolate lava cake.   When I made the reservation, I told them it was Jeff's birthday. Upon arrival, they wished him a happy birthday and escorted us from the [handsome but very noisy] main dining room into what looks like a converted private space. No ambiance, no windows but quieter.   And although we appreciate a reprieve from the noise, there was piped in [bad] music. Ugh. So I'm sitting in the back forty, eating a $9 salad that is mostly chopped iceburg lettuce, some cherry tomato and a few candied walnuts, drinking a Smirnoff Cosmo [my fault for not specifying the vodka] that had almost half a lime in it.   Dinner was the lovely's 6 oz filet, baked potato and asparagus, and my Lobster tempura. He was happy, I was not. To their credit, lobster was perfectly cooked and but the tempura coating was so greasy - greasy as in they didn't drain it properly. The soy ginger sauce had so much salt I couldn't enjoy it and the accompanying jicama salad was overdressed.   The chocolate lava cake was yummy, coffee was meh.   Before dessert, manager Tracy brought a gift card and wished Jeff a happy birthday - a nice touch but we wont got back. For almost $200 we can have a stellar meal, more food, and a lovely experience at Capital Grille.

On a not-so-typical Saturday, my husband wakes up and can not move. Well okay, not full out paralysis, after all my hunky monkey is a weight lifting stud who takes pretty good care of himself...but his back was not allowing his lower body to move without pain. So we rush, all ambulance style to the chiropractor before he closes and are told that the big man has a serious back strain for which he must rest. We go out to the fine little cab that is my 07 Accord, hubby walking like a 90 year old and the car will not start. WTF?   Did I mention the hunk was also a grease monkey at one point in time? Oh yeah, he says, its dead. Summoning my charm to the Tempe Muni guys who had just pulled up for lunch at Jason's, they gave us a jump AND refused to let us buy them lunch. Big love to them...Raced down the street to Purcell's where we pulled in and 20 minutes later [hubby still in car, playing solitare on his phone and waiting patiently to be medicated] had a new battery!  The manager is from Beantown - he and the mechanic who installed could not have been nicer. Speedy in, speedy out [on a Saturday, no less] and most importantly, no bullshit. Would go back there in a flash -

I know that even within my own corporate halls there are discussions over New York vs Chicago pizza and who has the best...All I've ever really known is New York style. [We've shipped in Chicago and its a bomber - loaded with cheese and meat and a total heart stopper. ] So now that you know my dirty little secret, this is good pizza. Not woohoo over the top, but its good. Sorry, but no self-respecting NY pizza would have either the deep dish-ish sensibility or the crispy crust thing.   We frequently take the kids [aged 19 -7] and its a hit. I'm not a wings person but all reports are that the one flavor - buffalo - are good. Its clean, service is right on and pleasant. Totally can't complain.

Me and the lovely went here on a Groupon buy and I so wanted to love it. Sorry to say we did not. We were seated by a very friendly host, next to a map of Thailand painted on the wall and the bar opposite. I felt a little like I'd been put in the back 40.   Waiter was nice but a little clueless; I asked for a reco on what the house did best. He totally stammered and stared at his feet and finally said 'a lot of people get the whole fish'. Not wowed. A nice wine list helped but I have had better Thai food elsewhere. No kefir lime leaves in the Panang, no fresh basil...I get it was their version but I didn't think it was great and neither did the lovely. To top it off, stammering waiter man/boy brings the check and says did you want anything for desert? Um. No thanks.   It would have been a pricey meal had we not had the Groupon [$40 food for $20]. $52 plus tip for just okay and not such a nice atmosphere? I say, meh.

Gravy to my train. Bow to my wow. Meow to my mix. This place is awesome! Just ask my dog.   I brought Lucas here as a referral and because he needed some tests, he ended up staying until I was able to pick him up at the end of my work day. The vet techs [and all the staff] who work there are crazy sweet - two brought him up to me when I picked him up and both were telling me what a great dog he is. And my boy Lucas, although always preferring to be at my side, is happy here. He does not turn to run. He smells, he gets love and has gotten treatment from Dr. Newland that has literally brought him back to life.   Dr. Newland explains the treatment options and any potential affects. He follows up and calls when he says he will. On one occasion I asked for a different medication for a rescued cat and he called me to discuss my options. In my previous experience, the vet wouldn't call, they'd give another prescription to the front desk and have them call. No matter. Pick an experience here - they've all been great. I am so grateful to be able to be confident that my animals are receiving the best possible care. As another reviewer points out, its what we'd want for ourselves as well.   Thank you too Kristi and Kimber especially, for always being so so kind no matter what kind of morning frenzy I'm having.

hmmm...fun! sporadic!! energetic!? none of the above.  BUT - lovely quiet property. really good food altho the orgasmatron went off only for the tiramisu. GENIUS. I'm a total tiramisu snot ball so if it stinks I don't want it.  The lovely Lauren, our waitress recommended it and said if I didn't like it it was on her and I could have the blueberry marscarpone cheesecake instead. Either way I was winning...didn't have to trade off. It was the right amount in a delightful not-too-sweet- chocolate cup. Yummmmm.   Oh so you want to know about dinner? I started with the Dungeness crab salad. Nice, light, interesting mix of flavors which I liked very much but left me feeling like something was missing. For dinner I had the seared ahi appetizer - I know, done everywhere but I really just felt like a small portion of nice fish. It was that. Again, good but no wow factor. Perfect for what I wanted but I wished it had more umph.   Service was great - it was a slow Monday. Wine list is a budget killer and a bit more manageable by the glass. We weren't rushed and overall a very nice experience and meal. I'd most certainly go back.   yeah, go.

.. And they only get the second star because of the service department. We had two miserable trips to this dealership before we bought our Volvo at another dealership. Sales person was bordering on rude and acted like he was doing us a favor by showing us a car. When it came to the money factor, riiiiiiiidiculous. Hedged and hummed and did the 'manager' dance to the point of illness. Just not worth it. We don't begrudge them making money but we weren't willing to pay more for the car than our research suggested it was worth. And they were not pleasant to deal with. We have the car serviced there because of the convenience of their location [which makes me grimmace] and its been just the opposite experience. Competent and polite.

I ride. The beauty of a trail ride at this stable is that it's fine if you do, fine if you don't. It's a guided ride [yeah don't think you'll be galloping up through Papago] which means a walk. A lovely walk in the desert. We took the kiddo and Jeff's sister on a gorgeous Arizona spring day. Cactus blooming in the hills, a breeze and a wonderful view.   The folks are kind and considerate and you get your money's worth [cash or check only]. Riding in Arizona generally does not come cheaply and the rates here are very reasonable. The kiddo [11] did great on - as others mention - a docile horse, Vegas. Our guide Kevin made sure we were all secure and patiently encouraged the kiddo when his horse went on an unscheduled side trip for greens.   It's worth the trip, a hidden gem along Tempe Town Lake.

Tricks just keeps getting better and better. I have gone here frequently over the years and our last three visits have been wonderful.  The most recent, on a spectacular Saturday afternoon at about 2:30, the lovely and I sauntered over to Tricks, were placed at a table in front of the bar area and proceeded to have one of the loveliest meals in a long time.   It was the lunch menu and I had a sandwich of grilled chicken, goat cheese, fig jam and greens served on ciabatta. Jeff had Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak and Asadero Cheese Stuffed Tortillas with Roasted Ancho Guajillo Sauce, Avocado Puree and Cilantro Rice [...pulled that off the menu...] Both so amazingly good alongside a Terlato Pinot Gris!   We followed that up with dessert. We shared two different chocolate treats - one a flourless fortress with sugared pistachios and macerated figs, the other a 'smore's brownie'. The first was delightful by any measure but we were both smitten by the brownie. Buttered graham crackery delishushness under a smooth chocolate and toasted marshmallow that was not at all unctuous but a TOTAL delight of chocolate sweet, buttery salty yum. We were so full but we managed to choke it all down!   Top that all off with a charming waiter with wonderful ease and recommendations and some very fine coffee. We loved every minute. We rarely say 'perfect' about our dining experiences and on this afternoon, we did. It was perfect. Thank you Tricks.

I can not believe that I've lived in Tempe for 5 years and I've just visited Caffe Boa recently. I loved it.   It was a chilly night and I decided to sit inside. Our waiter was extremely attentive and gave us an enthusiastic schpiel about the natural ingredients,  scratch cooking etc.; and then he moved onto the wine. There were three different bottles being featured on this particular Tuesday evening and I was completely enamoured with our choice and found it to be a lovely addition to the meal and not overly priced. [Kuddos to the waiter here: we wanted our white chilled more than cellar temp and he was very accommodating: brought a chiller and asked waited until we felt it was chilled enough to pour.]    We split an arugula salad to start - fresh, peppery greens with a light dressing and a shaving of parmesan and some lemon. It was a generous portion for a share and delicious. I had ravioli which was light, flavorful and delicious. My date had osso buco and we both thought the dishes were lick-the-plate delish.   We had been assured by our waiter that the tiramissou had gotten raves and so we decided to share it. We were both completely disappointed. There was too much cocoa on the top, rendering it chalky and dry and not enough real substantial flavor. To management's credit, the manager came out and asked why and what we didn't like, apologized and removed it from the bill. Two points.   I still give it 5 based on the quality of the ingredients, the taste of the food and the service. I'll keep looking for reasons to go back.

SInce my last review, I've been to Boa three other times. All under the previous chef. Tonights visit, brought to you by the now infamous chef Payton from Digestif. Given some of the jabs of late here in yelpdom, I was ready to be disappointed. We went nonetheless.   Waiter Jeff [I think] I recognized from a previous visit and make no mistake, is part of the reason the experience was as good as it was. He was right on the wine reco and offered us a taste of the wine we were asking about. We ate good AND we ate a lot. I ate critically; my lovely, less a foodie still was very pleasantly fed.    The bread starter with the Queen Creek Olive Oil [giggle...] hummus and sun dried tomato aioli was a hit. Loved the hummus but it was all yum. I stepped out on a limb and ordered the mozz app. I loved it. Am a girl whose been married to an Italian [or 2] and it was very fine. Everything about it. Texture, amount of salt, peppers and vinegar. Great. I thought it was about perfect.   We each had a salad course: me the field greens with pear and bleu cheese, lovely with caesar. Okay, blah blah blah caesar...the field salad was a really nice mix of greens and sweet/salty. I did utter that I could have had sex with the bleu cheese. It was creamy delicious perfect balance of creamy and sharp...but that 's just me. We  both ordered pasta. Like others before me, my heart sank when I didn't see the dishes that I had come to love here and seemed perfect.   The dish I had was Voodoo Penne. Chicken tomato, light cream sauce, a little cheese. It, like the Alfredo, just didn't pop. I wanted that delicious yum lick the plate experience. It wasn't there. I didn't think there were strong enough flavor in either dish, or enough salt. Having said that, the pasta was cooked perfectly and arrived hot - albeit before the end of our salad [ in fairness, he offered to take the pasta back to the kitchen ]. Mine was not overly sauced and my date loved his Alfredo. He couldn't stop eating it, even though he was full.  That's an endorsement.  We finished with a shared pot de creme. In a huge cup. It was delish but way too big. Something that rich doesn't need to be in a supersized cup. Cafe au lait was perfection. PERFECTION. Can't say enough about really good French press coffee served hot. Yummmmm.   Neglected to mention the Bishops Peak cab/shiraz/cab franc we both had. We thought it was great and not a budget killer at $7/glass. All tolled we gave it a thumbs up. Very pleasant evening on the patio, wait staff was on it and pleasant. Have to bang it down a star if only for the absence of what I really felt like was amazing food. It was awfully good and we walked away $112 lighter in our wallet....

I'm so totally on board.   Very cool place - so welcoming - and in the 'hood no less!!! I took a shot because I wanted spray tan and an edgier cut. Got both and left happy, bank account intact!!   In a world where once upon a time, I paid Frederic Fekkai an INSANE amount of money to do a mediocre job on my hair. I was so  pleased that Kenton not only listened but delivered a great cut - exactly what I wanted and I love it. And he's a peach - total sweetheart; although I gotta say, everyone I came in contact with here was very kind.   Spray tan was discounted for me as a first timer there and it was done well. Not over the top color but enough to say weekend at the beach.   It was all good. Humble thanks to the Yelpers who have gone before; yet again it landed me in a good spot.

Another bow down to the gods of Yelpdom! In search of GOOD local Chinese, I find the recos for Totts. Hallefreakinlujah!   I called in my takeout order an hour ahead; the woman taking my order repeated it to me twice over the phone [always a good sign]...I show up at the appointed hour and BAM, there's my order[repeated back again, thank you], screaming hot. This was a first visit and as reported by other yelpers, the manager greeted me with a smile and affable chit chat about my 4 different chicken dishes! He made me feel like I was the only one there and he was happy to be of service. What, I ask you, could be bad about THAT??   We tried the Bangkok curry, orange chicken, bourbon chicken, sweet and sour chicken [mainstay for the kids] and the potsticker appy. Large portions all, I gotta say I loved the curry as I am a total curry suck-up; but all of the others were really good. Of the non curry, I'd say the Bourbon was my fave. Potstickers and sauce were deevine. Could have made a meal of just them and probably will on a return trip.   Immaculately clean space with tables in and out, its my new go-to place for Chinese. Top notch service, four entrees, each with an accompanying rice container, potstickers and the harbingers of my future, fortune cookes, I walk away smiling, having spent $36 before tip.

Add mine to the list of 'damn, the food is good here' [as long as you order the right thing] and the guacamole is delish. Add also that the service - yeah, you Dario - was bogus. Guac order came with the entrees, side salad for one of the three of us never delivered or acknowledged as missing, and generally a sense that he was doing us a favor coming to work today. Neat.   On food grounds alone its very fine. I had the langostine quesadilla and it was delish: a nice chunk of lobster on each [and there are four 4" tortillas/quesadillas], in a sweet sauce that was perfectly countered by goat cheese. I tasted the fish tacos - also seemed perfectly matched: the slight heat of the baja sauce, perfectly cooked fish [lightly battered and not at all heavy or greasy]and cabbage...nice. I didn't try the mole but the report was bland. We all loved the guac and the chips. [Two of us had soda, one an iced tea - bill came to $72 before tip for three of us.]  Be warned, this is not a quiet place. Even two-thirds full at lunch, its loud. I could see bringing friends and drinking margaritas, and having the noise just be part of the enjoyment. Now if only Dario would stay home...

Took the opportunity on this past perfect May weekend to use my Fox gift certificate and find a table outside. Bring on the O&I.   With a nod to the other yelpers, I was cautiously optimistic about the Scottsdale vibe [you know, are your boobs/car/jewelry big enough] enough to go with the Lovely. It was early and we had a reservation in which I had requested the patio. We drove up and although a bit put off by the $6 valet - um, really? used it nonetheless.   Seated right as we walked in, on the patio. Lovely night, perfect setting. Except for the choice of music - it seemed weird. I'm sorry, 'Play that Funky Music'?? With your filet and tempranillo? Not so much. Service was spot on, and actually a bit too 'on' I don't think its great to clear my plate when my dinner mate is still eating...just sayin'.   As others have noted, pesto and bread to die for. i tried the prosciutto and fig bruschetta which was yummy [not as good as Postino...] and Jeff had the margherita flatbread. Really fresh and light. He had the tenderloin, I had the tuna. Both scrumptious, lightly sauced and cooked to perfection. Dessert was a shared nutella pudding. Lovely unctuous pudding and whipped cream topped with roasted hazelnuts. Music to my tastebuds. Lovely texture and flavor. Wonderful coffee as well.   Nice wine list, very good cocktails and an atmosphere at least outdoors that was fab. Did i sound whiney? Dont mind me. Go, it'll be well worth it.

Um. YAY!  Picture a girl hanging with her lovely on a Monday afternoon after what could be politely described as a terrible week before, looking to soothe her spirit with some lovely food and atmosphere [the company was already delightful...]. I saw a piece in the local rag about C4 and since we're already in Moon Valley I say 'how 'bout it'. Jeff agrees and we're off -   We arrived just before 4 - closing time and the bartender/waitperson was reeeeally nice. She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off. No worries, we remain unfazed. We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace. The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in. We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich. I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef. The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers, cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo [not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same] on a toasted baguette. Roast beef was similar in scale, lots of meat with melted cheddar, greens also on a toasted baguette. Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle.   It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon, we didn't feel rushed or in the way. It was just a nice, shoulder dropping, ahhhh experience. Not the spa, but just what the doctor ordered.   Serious yay, total digdom. We wanted to plant a place just like it of our own on the beach in Maui...its nice to dream...Totally worth the trip; we will be back

Four stars?? I think not.   The lovely had lunch here previously, said it was good. We went for an early dinner.   The decor is old and walking in it was damp and smelled like someone's basement. The whole feel of the place is dark and damp and sorry, not clean. Yeah, like gum under the table not clean.  Nice waitress takes our drink order and comes back with yummy chips and salsa. This was the highlight of the meal. Not wanting a carbo load, I order a breakfast burro with chorizio [menu says, egg, cheese, chorizo]. I get a very nice tortilla loaded to the gills with chorizo, couldn't find the egg or the cheese. WTF?? It wasn't even delish chorizo but since I was famished, I ate a third and pushed the plate away. Lovely had chicken taco platter. He ate one and said it was bad, it had no taste. He pushed his plate aside with the remainder untouched. Waitress asked what was wrong and he told her and then she asked me. I told her it was just okay. To their credit, they took Jeff's food off the bill. Damage already done. Awful. Will not go back. E v e r.

I've taken my now 7 year old son here for the last 4 years. This location replaced the now closed Elliot location. Its a scene and a wait if you don't have an appointment or get there late on a Saturday but its worthwhile. They have videos and movies to keep the kids entertained and they consistently give my kid a great haircut. Having said that, its not a cheap haircut - $16 without tip. For my money, its worth it, although it meant I had to forfeit star number 5.

Time flies when you're having fun...2 years hence and I still take the sparkly offspring here. Other reviewer is absolutely correct, especially on the weekend, if you don't have an appointment you'll have a serious wait. I tend to go weekdays after work and its relatively quiet. Even then, I call for the appointment first. Its still a very fine hair cut and I know what to expect - the goob seems to enjoy the fact that he can play Sonic while his head is otherwise engaged.   If we went more often I'd probably rethink the expense because it is $17.95 plus tip. For now, its worth it.

Thanks to all the yelpers whose reviews prompted a date night trip to Thai Rama! Woo-freakin-hoo!!!!  We started with the beef satay, which was out of this world. Perfectly seasoned and barbecued meat that was non stop good. I had the Panang Curry with medium heat and was completely wowed.  Hubby's meal - a completely unpronounceable chicken dish with cashews, peanuts, water chestnuts, onion and pepper was similarly amazing. Medium heat that was right on and a non-curry sauce that was to die for.   Neither one of us wanted to stop eating, but we did and were able to bring home leftovers...With tea, appy, meals and tip the whole thing came to 35 bucks!  OH MY G!! We are so totally going back. .. And we'll use the drive through window too! GO. Its totally worth the trip.

Still spot on for my favorite Thai food. The lovely and I are both ardent admirers of the panang curry and last night we wondered out loud why we'd been gone for so long!! Still delicious, unctuous curry with fresh ingredients that has yet to be matched elsewhere. Having said that, we have not been disappointed by anything we have tried; we took my vegetarian older brother on a recent visit and he swooned.   Service is always kind and attentive; the food arrives hot and promptly. Added bonus? A kid's menu that accommodates the less sophisticated, chicken tender-needy kiddo. Complete with delicious waffle fries and a very reasonable price.  This is a very relaxed, clean place, with takeout and a liquor license. We want one closer to home!!

Have to agree with the other yelpers here...food is fresh; bread is amazing. I'm a fan of the Turkey BLT especially [sourdough bread, grilled carved turkey, applewood smoked bacon, romaine, roasted tomato and paprika mayo!]   The pesto pizza is also very fine. I didn't love the Caesar salad I've had but that was mostly because I found the dressing had too much garlic. Its all made to order and they do a fine job when I call ahead for a take out order; its ready when I get there or very shortly thereafter.   The surroundings are nice and its especially nice to be able to sit outside on the nicer evenings. But here too, will share in the 'how about a clean table' complaint. I mean, I'm payin' 7 and a half bucks for a sandwich. A clean table should come with. All in all though still a reco for a really good lunch or dinner.

oh yeah, uh huh, uh huh...visualize peeps: Its the happy dance! You freakin' yelpers made me look like a rock star for picking this place for a lunch meeting. I said, uh, no Stingray, lets go HERE. It was a pleasure.   We ordered sashimi, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, yellow tail and volcano rolls. It was all good and very fresh. We especially enjoyed the volcano and at the end of our meal, our server suggested the dynamite roll for a return visit. We were still hungry and stoked so we ordered it right then. It was amazing and delicious.   For our lunch the service was spot on and really friendly. I totally enjoyed the sushi chef and helper thanking us for coming in. I can't think of anything that would have improved the experience. YAY!

love. i can't give this place 5 stars because that would mean that its as impeccable as say, tcooks. Having said that, the food here is wonderful. Been for lunch and dinner and the kitchen consistently puts out great stuff. i've had the chicken caesar salad, which has a generous portion of grilled chicken breast, lots of fresh romaine which was not overly dressed. yum. The last time i was there [last week] i had the seared ahi and it was pretty damn close to perfection. My lovely eats there at least once a week; alas he is not a yelper but loves the fact its in his neighborhood and it's always a good meal.   The space is attractive, not too noisy and the service during the times I've been has been very attentive and friendly.

Okay so its not tcooks but it has yet to disappoint and its really good. The lovely and I are just about regulars. We went on Valentines Day and it was stellar. They had a fixed menu in addition to the a la carte menu and upon said menu was a bbq pork tenderloin with basis mac & cheese. What better to top off an already a m a z i n g day than some mac and cheese? When asked, the kitchen happily agreed to serve the pork a la carte. Perfectly cooked tenderloin accompanied by the nicest, most comforting mac and cheese, ever. It had the addition of poblano which surprisingly did not offend as it was not overpowering. The lovely Jeff had the maple crusted chicken from the standard menu which was a first for us and it was also wonderful. We languished for an hour and a half - not a bums rush in sight. Even with a full dining room, service was great and the room wasn't deafening.   An added benny - the glorious Lot 205 Chard was out of this world and half price. Oh so yay!! Finished with very fine coffee [which is standard, here] and a warm banana walnut bread pudding in a bourbon anglaise. Oh yes. Oh my. Happy delicious warm delightful comfort food. We will be back for more.

Jeff and I drove to Basis last night, July 5th.  Our most recent attempt was a Sunday night and we were greeted by a notice that said they would not be opening Sundays in the summer. Total bummer. Last night we found the parking lot empty and the space completely bare of any fixtures or signs of restaurant life. Alas, Basis is closed.   Owner Steve Short wrote a thoughtful piece regarding the decision and its available here:  http://www.atlastacatering.com/Basis_New_American.html  We are so sad to see them go; it was for us, a place of welcome and frequently celebration. Delightful food and wine in an atmosphere that was completely down to earth and as Steve says, unpretentious.

These days I dream about two things food wise: A Sprinkles red velvet cupcake [which I swear have some habit forming delishushness] and the Salami, Goat Cheese, Pesto sandwich from Bertha's [cue singing angels]. Ge.Ni. Us. Fresh delicious ciabatta roll, yummy stack of salami with goat cheese and pesto, topped with mixed baby greens. An unusual and AMAZING combination. Crazy good.   Nice menu, freshy fresh ingredients and in my work 'hood. Am devoted.

Because I frequent the consignment store next door, I remembered lovingly the days of the salami/goat cheese sandwich [since this is no longer the work 'hood...]. It still does not disappoint. And because I'm being more proactive about 'healthiER' eats, this time I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich. Seriously just as good with roasted peppers, roast chicken pesto and all warm and fresh. It's a lot of sandwich so for me, its two meals easy. Two days worth of happy food. I'm all in.

Okay so I don't want to bring my 6 year old into a sushi restaurant. Its Saturday and I call for take out, thinking we've done Ra and Sushi 101 so lets try Bombers. We brought home sashimi, tataki and sushi. Its priced between Ra and Sushi 101 but both my husband and I thought it was meh at best, blech at worst. Maybe its a better experience if you're there and drinking, but we were not impressed. Its not impeccable fish, its just okay.

just. kill. me. now.   Heinous parking - even middle of the day! Ridiculous to get around and so crowded it gives me hives. I will travel to the PetSmart on Elliott rather than here just to avoid it. Will bring small child to matinee only - and even then, only during the week.   Completely not fun. On any level.

Terrible. We have 3 dogs, 3 cats. We rarely see the same vet twice and on a recent visit with one of the cats: 1) his weight was read as 22 lbs, when he weighed 12;  2) the doctor said it could be one of three things and gave me medication that 'might work' along with a bill for $200+ ; 3) took the cat for grooming less than a week later only to be told he needed ANOTHER exam for a rabies shot AND he had gum disease and another possible infection - this info from a second doctor there. 450 bucks down, I am not returning. Nurses are much warmer than the doctors, doctors could seem to care less. I'd catagorize this place and overpriced and under managed. Will not go back.

How do I love these guys?? Let me count the ways!!   I was trading in my car and wanted top dollar. Scott was able to 1) change my appointment same day, 2) come to my off-site meeting, 3) make my car, including the engine look rockin' tight!!   He did the entire car, inside and out - including the trunk, where they emptied my worldly goods into bags to clean it properly. I asked him to remove a decal and my favorite dashboard hula girl and he did both - making it appear as they had never been there.The car looked phenominal AND I got the highest end of blue book value. Yay!  Scott himself is a peach and a real pro and he wants you to be a satisfied customer.His guys were also kind and really good. Nice and professional? Oh yeah. It's all good. Really, really good.

Let the love continue! Scott's work still blows me away. With the kind of attention to detail that simply sets him apart, he has consistently provided an amazingly high level of service. Every detailing that he's done on my last two cars has been impeccable.   As we are heading back into New Car-ville, Scott arrived early to work on my car pre-trade-in. I have child and dogs - long haired, shedding dogs. Light upholstery and black car mats. The car looks brand new both inside and out. It is no accident that professional athletes call on him and even so, he treats me and my car as every bit as important.   A wonderful person and business person, I appreciate Scott and his work.  Showcase is the bomb. All that. And the bag of chips.

This is actually a solid 3 1/2 star review. Surprisingly, I can't really decide why I'm not more bowled over.   This was described to me as a menu that was 'Houston's-like' [with all due respect Mr. Alexander...] and I saw some resemblance in some of the dishes but as a fan of said fraternal twin, I didn't see it, really. I digress...  I do love the look of the outdoor space and the roaring fire, especially on this unusually chilly day.  Inside, not so much, a little stifled yawnish...The service, spot on. We were able sit and chatter over our tea and our server kept returning to check on an order but not in a nasty way. I had Salmon Caesar ,which I thought was really good - fresh romaine, perfectly grilled salmon with some croutons and a nice kicky/sporty/garlicky-[insert your own caesarified adjective here meaning good and flavorful] dressing on the side, per my request. I wiped it out and mopped it up with the just okay focaccia.  I totally enjoyed the food and the fact we weren't rushed through any of it. Cost is comparable to Houstons, maybe a little less. So, yes, it was good, it wasn't wow and I'd go back for a lunch but yeah, that ambiance needs some help.

I was looking for a reco for a 'significant' [eh hem] birthday dinner and foodie friend Jim suggested Mission because of Matt Carter.  We had a 7 res and parked right in front...fire blazing out front, nice feeling. Inside, the decor is appealling but because of the lack of soft surfaces, its really loud. [Full disclosure: I did not inform them it was my birthday] We were seated along the banquette wall and were a two top next to a four on each side. Noisy, obnoxious.   Server was very nice although stumbled over the bar order [and it turned out they made a scotch substition that they made no mention of]. Had I not already done my yelp research I would have been at a loss as to what to order. We skipped the apps and had the swordfish and the pork. Swordfish was a fine attempt but I thought over citrified and small bit over cooked. The pork tacos were genius. The combination of the pork, the sauce and the accompanying red onion, queso and cilantro on the home made corn tortilla just sang. The pork arrived as a glistening chunk that falls apart. Well worth the $32 and meant for two. You can also ask for more of the tortillas.   We shared the churros and milkshake for dessert. DEEEVINE. Warm chocolate churros sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and an amazing milk shake that we really enjoyed.   I'd go back and sit outside by the fire and eat the apps and have drinks Plates are small to begin with and I think if you expect a crazy WOW dining experience, you'll be disappointed. I think the service is working out some kinks, the bar seemed okay [although the TV is this space seems well, off putting...] and the kitchen seemed to be cranking.   I do think its very fine food.   .

It's still so good.   Wonderful cocktails supplied by the sweet and capable Brian at the bar. Table side guacamole is just amaze - bright flavors, freshy fresh happy food accompanied by warm, unending supply of chips. Delish.   First time for the Barbacoa tacos. Genius. Beautifully cooked and seasoned, piled on top of the fresh tortillas. Yikes. I wasn't that hungry after the guac but had no problem happily eating these. I like them just as much as the pork tacos and its just the right amount of food.   We had coffee - yum to the french press - alongside of which was a cinnamon shortbread that had some pepper heat. Perfect. The table shared churros. I love you Mission, but the churros were meh. A bit overcooked and it seemed like the oil in the fryer need to change. Its a nit pick, granted. Otherwise, it was a full house, service was humming and dinner was great. Still a fan.

BooYah to Rick in the garden department here. The Lovely and I went in search of frost tolerant trees and were directed to Rick. It was 110' and he was full of energy and knowledge and we left with two large Rosewood trees based on the information he gave us. So pleased to have access to that kind of help just down the street - not to mention the trees!!   They always have my AC filters and are a good paint resource as well. I'm a fan; will always take Lowes over Home Depot and so far anyway, I haven't had issues with not being able to find what I need.

Love.   The building is great, minimal but in a comfy way and not overdone in an austere fussy kinda way. Nice outdoor seating with a yummay fireplace...Like it here, did I mention that??   Service was attentive and friendly. I ordered the duck club and for a side told the waiter to surprise me. He brought me delicious french fries with light parmesan cheese and parsley and were to die for. The sandwich was similarly deiish. Duck breast with a sweet, smoky tomato sauce and some applewood smoked bacon that were sandwiched between a soft, challah type roll that was a perfect foil for what was in the middle; light and lucious and not too much bread.   It's in my work 'hood but not my neighborhood, even so, made an immediate report to the lovely: must go!!

Grooming, boarding, daycare. You name it, this is the place to go. My 3 year old rescue attends daycare and is loved and looked after. All three fur kids have been boarded and groomed here, happily. Wonderful staff [special h/t to Amaris, Marianna and Katelyn] led by Howard and Tammy who always greet us warmly. Affordable, immaculate and caring. It simply does not get better.

A strong 4.5. (Yelp? Where are the halfsies?)   I love this place. Great coffee, good food, great service all wrapped up in wifi and a super cool, large space - with parking!!!  There for a working lunch with my business partner, it was the ideal spot. We both had sandwiches. Partner had tuna, I had chicken pesto. I'd give mine a solid B (I'm pretty opinionated about my pesto...) - bread was fresh, chicken moist, red peppers were raw on a hot sandwich which would have been okay if they were thinly sliced. Pesto was plentiful but not quite spot on for me. I can't speak to the tuna - partner enjoyed it in its entirety. Brewed coffee was delish. Service, awesome. We both said we would come back. And bonus points to echo's owner who thanked us as we left. Ahhh the humanity.

I simply can not account for others less than stellar reviews. I found this spot to be delightful. A true, no-pressure European cafe experience and crazy good salad and crepe. I had a smoked salmon/dill crepe that was accompanied by a delicious handful of fresh greens that were lightly dressed and my extremely well behaved son [yeah for a 9 year old with some self control...] had creme brulee that was superbly delightful. I love the decor, it has a casual sophistication and we listened to some wonderful guitar music while we ate.   I didn't feel rushed; the owner and the waiter were both lovely and conversational. Made me wish I lived closer so I could be a regular and sip my orangina in the sunshine...

I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever.   Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars?   Ugh.

Not a bad thing to say about Seasons 52. We sat in a booth next to the kitchen, noise level was moderate @ 6:30 and we enjoyed the piano player.   We started with a smoked salmon flatbread - gorgeous, light and delicious. [Mirrasou '09 Pinot Noir and '08[I think] Greg Norman Chard on the table]. For dinner, the Lovely had beef tenderloin served with mashed potatoes and asparagus and and a amazing sauce. He was swooning. I had a Wild Caught Copper River Salmon served on a corn risotto with asparagus, roasted red pepper and a dill sauce on the side that was both perfectly cooked and perfectly delish. We both agreed that the portion size was perfect and were both extremely happy with our entrees. Dessert - the mini mocha macchiato [vanilla bean mouse/chocolate cake/coffee mouse topped with caramel] and coffee was cherry on the top. Nice wine list, sweet waiter - thanks Alan - wonderful food portioned perfectly. Really a very fine A+ experience.

The lovely and I have made two trips here - once in the Premium seating, once in the Premium Plus. Everything already reported is true, its clean, low stress, comfortable and pricey. We were totally jazzed about the Premium experience - reserved spots, no screamers...ahhhh.   The Premium Plus? mmm OK. But just OK. And mostly because with food and wine its in the $110-$120 vicinity. Don't get me wrong - service was attentive, seats are relaxing and comfortable, greeting from all of the employees, great. Food was okay, wine was nice and not crazy at $9. Glad we tried it but for us, not worth it - free popcorn notwithstanding.  We will continue to go and enjoy the Premium seats.

Nothing but good experience with this location. I buy a high end, no grain food for the pups and I've found the price very reasonable. Unlike the Gilbert location, Tempe told me about the suppliers' buy 12 bags and get the next one free.   I found the employees here to be kind and enthusiastic. I'm grateful for the competitively priced premium food available in the neighborhood.

Its only 4 stars because I have yet to bring the dogs here...  Dr. Wells has taken very good care of my cats - one in particular, our cancer cat, Ellie who has had two tumors removed. Whats particularly notable about his treatment of her was that he was very measured and clear about the possibility of the return of the cancer and that he didn't recommend chemo because it only extends life expentancy a small amount and gives them crummy quality of life. For that alone he gets 4 stars. And although the mighty Ellie - all 8 punds of her - does not abide the vehicle, she calms down in the presence of the nursing staff and Dr. Wells.   He takes his time explaining treatment options and answering any questions you might have. Wait times are generally very short and the new office is clean, airy and modern. And while cancer surgery isn't cheap, I don't feel like I'm being nickeled and dimed every time I walk through the door. Will be bringing two of the dogs there this summer.

Great, great, great. Fabulous location [in my work 'hood], wonderful building, capable and friendly staff and the usual ahmazing food.   Was so glad to know that this very fine sibling is close to work and just as good as the Arcadia location. I went for lunch and was not disappointed. A wait for tables but we saddled up to the bar and were served there. A busy hum to the place but service was tight and the bar tender attentive. For the record, I had the Mozzarella Chicken on ciabatta. Delish. More bread than I usually eat but totally worth the carbs.   I could continue the rant but like so many others, I was blown away in the best possible way. And will return.

I loved the cheeseburger!! And didn't have any of the lousy experiences the other yelpers had. No smoke, really nice servers, and hot, non-greasy burgers.   We've had our share of lousy over-priced burgers but we all agreed that the burgers here were really good. The lovely's sister was in town and she's a fan of the fries [she has them in Denver...] I wanted a cheeseburger after the fabulous Christmas show extravaganza down the street and was not disappointed. Two patties, cheese and ketchup - juicy n tasty.  De freakin lish. Hot fresh and yum. The lovely had more 'decorations' on his and enjoyed it along with the other half of mine.   And while I'll go out of my way for a cheeseburger, will not for fries. The sis thinks these are the bomb. I was meh. They're freshly cut and hot, not overly salted - fine. And good lawd enough to feed a family of four!!   Pricey but better than In and Out or Smashburger. By. Far. Would not hesitate to return. I will - because of Stephen B's  August rant -  go try Delux :)

With apologies to the grammatically minded, I seem to have lost my vocabulary this afternoon...  Went for lunch with the BP [aka business partner/good friend] today and she reminded me that this was the old Sophie's Bistro spot. I loved Sophie's and am now that I'm working back on this side of town I'm glad to find a Binkley hoe down.    As, always, the good:  Interior and exterior that have been lifted and lightened beautifully. Really comfortable ambiance, wonderful service.   Foodwise: shazam! I had the shrimp roll and it made me soo happy. Shrimp was perf, pickled celery was perf, not too much dressing...all on a buttered,toasted split roll [the right kind of roll yet!] that was also, perfect. Yummy side salad had beautifully fresh greens, pepitas, raisins and had a light, sweet dressing. Partner had the chicken salad sandwich - she was smiling. A light delicious green tea was perfect on this August day. Dessert was [as our waiter informed me] the 'Best of Phoenix donut'  thingy mabob. Sorry, I got stuck on the omgosh, its an award winning donut! It's a bowl full of small, very warm cinnamon sugar donut thingys - smaller than a ping pong ball - served along side some delicious Mexican chocolate mousse-esque mound. Tasty enough for this donut fan but I have to say I didn't like the hard crunchy on the outside, softer on the inside thing. I like gooey, doughy, sweet. It was overall delicious food.  The oh-so-slight boo hiss. And I do mean slight. I don't like the valet. Its a bit pretentious for this space, at least at lunch. Please don't leave me in a line with the back of my car hanging out on Osborn. Apart from the fact its not a good look for me, I don't need that kind of stress going to lunch when I could have just as easily parked my car. Valet was nice and efficient so at least if I have to do this, he parked me out front, facing out so I could leave easily.   I'd go back in a heartbeat.
