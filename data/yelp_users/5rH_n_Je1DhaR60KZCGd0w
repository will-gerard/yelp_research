My wife and I went in and met Ryan. He answered all of our questions, gave a great tour, showed us all of the personal trainer bios and made us feel great about our decision. It's because of him that we committed immediately. Unlimited child care, my wife and I came to $68 a month. You can't beat it! Thanks again Ryan

I only come here out of convenience. They usually don't have something, last week it was a 30 min wait for guac and this week it is 45min wait for rice. I ordered online and I stand here as people pass and get their food. Online ordering is an absolute joke. They have no idea what preparation means and I've seen three people turn around because they have now ran out of chicken and it'll be 10min for chicken. That literally just happened. Oh and someone just came back in because they forgot the cheese. Unreal

Gavin is a rockstar, after three cuts he had it down and all I do is sit and he goes to work. Good guy to small talk with too. 6 stars from me

I am a sales associate for a company called Sleep America.  I have an appreciation for sales techniques and I am a tough critic. I was greeted immediately by a man named Alex Parsons with a smile. He was dressed sharp and was very clean cut. He asked a few qualifying questions which I appreciated. I had brought in an expensive pair of shoes with me in hopes to find a belt to match. He asked for the shoe and immediately found a great belt in my size. He then asked if I would be interested in a pair of slacks to try it on with. (which was a seamless transition into an upsell... much appreciated) but the important thing to note... he asked not told. I said absolutely I would. He pulled around 6 options and continued to explain the different materials as well as styles. I decided on a flat front pair of pants made of whool. (great quality as well) I asked for a shirt to complete my ensemble. Unfortunately I have a difficult body frame and have a difficult time finding the correct fit and size. He even went to the trouble of asking the tailor to take a look. I felt like I was getting royal treatment and Alex spent a great amount of time with me, answering all of my questions, and meanwhile tidying up the store and giving me space. I decided to purchase the slacks, with a permanent crease, and had them hem the slacks as well. I was out the door with a new belt, a pair of great slacks and shoe pollish to boot! Thank you Alex for all of your great work. I have already referred a co-worker and he purchased two pairs of slacks and two shirts. The Tempe Marketplace store is fantastic, but more importantly, Alex was fantastic. I would prep him for a promotion if I was in management because he has all of the qualities of a manager.   If anyone is reading this and thinking of purchasing from this location, call and ask for Alex. He really suprised me because many of the reviews are so-so. He was unlike any other associate at nordstrom or macys (which is where I usually get my clothing) Call and set an appointment with him, you won't regret it!  Thanks again,  Alex Danesi

If it were possible to give negative stars I would. I got a flyer of a 1.00 down offer and decided to take a look over one year ago. They had a tent out front and I started asking questions. I wasn't able to even go inside but I paid the 1.00. I was told we would not be charged until we went for the first time and check in.  THESE GUYS ARE CROOKS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER GYM.  I now have a collection company calling me demanding payment for a balance in which I legally did not run up. We have never been there to this day but we still get calls.   BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY
