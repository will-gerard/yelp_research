So my friend from school and I decided randomly this past week that we wanted to go to the zoo, so we hopped into his Mercedes and made the little trip.  Considering it was Saturday, it was extremely busy and we had to park in the area where the school busses normally park, which isn't a big deal, but it is a tid bit of a walk. We had passes, so we scooted our way past the entire line (which is pretty sweet, because you don't have to wait in line by all of the kids who are screaming and yelling because they're not getting to see the animals yet).  The zoo isn't too huge, but we spent a good hour and a half there looking at all of the animals.  My favorite exhibit is the giraffe one, and it is extremely cool that you can do the "Giraffe Encounter" where you get to get up close and personal with them.  The food and the drinks are overpriced... I mean, seriously? $3.79 for a sno-cone? However, I don't blame you, Phoenix Zoo, all businesses pertaining to amusement tend to jack their prices up 500%.  Zoolights is really awesome. If you get the chance to go during the holidays, make sure you do it. It is absolutely beautiful and it is a lot of fun to go with friends or family!

If I HAD to pick something to complain about when it comes to Oregano's it would be the amount of time I have to wait.... "I'm HUNGRY! I want to eat!" However, if I were asked to complain about something else...I couldn't think of anything (and we all know I complain a lot).  Anyway, every single time I go to Oregano's I am satisfied. The pizzas are great, the pastas are great (the zany ziti specifically), the salads are great...everything is great.   Let's get to the real point here: The pizookie is the most amazing thing on the face of this planet. It get's it's own paragraph just so I can rant about it. I love the pizookie so much that I will force my stomach to make room so I can put that deliciousness in my belly. I would probably eat 10 if I were given the opportunity.  The service is always friendly and most of the time pretty funny too. The atmosphere is wonderful and it is a great place to go out with friends or family.   Eat at Oregano's because you will most certainly enjoy it.

Maybe I am just a sucker for music venues in general, but Rhythm Room gets five stars from me. Buried in the heart of Phoenix, it's the perfect place for a band to draw a nice-sized crowd.   I've been to RR several times to watching my friend's bands play, as well as to see some other not so local bands.  Now, Rhythm Room is quite small, which is why it makes a perfect venue for local bands. Especially when you're there to support a friend play. It's an awesome place to just hang out with friends, enjoy a few brews and listen to some great music. Just like most venues catering to all-ages, they do separate the underage from the of age, which then makes it awkward to try and talk to any one who isn't in your age bracket.   The drinks are moderately priced, but they do have some pretty decent daily specials. I think my only complaint about RR is the bathroom. If you've read any of my other reviews, I complain about bathrooms a lot.   But, alas, RR gets five stars because I have so many fond memories at this venue and I am a fan of the atmosphere.

You are so clean, Sky Harbor.  I don't mind flying out of this airport. The flight attendants are nice.  Security is fast and thorough. I really dislike one lady that works in security, because she was rude to me for no reason. It probably wouldn't have bugged me so much if it weren't for the fact that it was 11:45 PM, I had just worked a double, and I was being forced to fly to Ohio....where it was cold and still had snow on the ground.. Oh not to mention on my Spring Break.   Anyway, the stores are nice and have a good amount of nice items to buy for your flight to keep you occupied.   Flights are on time the majority of the time, and when they aren't they at least warn you.. *cough cough* Cleveland Hopkins International *cough cough*.  I suppose it could use some remodeling.

Desert Ridge is probably one of the ultimate locations for a CPK.  Every time I have been here they are extremely busy, especially during the lunch hours.  The pizza here is pretty decent, but my favorite item on the menu is the Waldorf Chicken salad with the dijon balsamic dressing. MMMMMM. I could eat this salad every day of my life. The apples and the grapes in it are so refreshing. The last time I visited I tried the Cherry Lime Sparkler, which is the adult version of a Cherry Limeade, I guess. It was also really great.   Although they are known for their pizza, I have to say that there are many better things on the menu. It may just be a personal preference, though.   Anywho, I love CPK and I will continue to go out of my way to dine here.

Walked in and was immediately greeted! Staff is super friendly. I got my brake pads and oil changed. They also did a complete inspection of my brake system. All for less than $300. What an amazing deal. Brake pad parts come with a 2 year warranty which is cool too. My car was done in about 2 1/2 hours which isn't bad!  The only thing that needs to be fixed is their online reservation booking. I booked a reservation online last week and when I got there yesterday, the store had never seen it. It worked out anyway, though because they were able to get me in. But I would recommend calling to set up a reservation.

The sushi here is exceptional. My friend, Mason P., and I went here for lunch today because we were in a sushi mood.  We ordered the Vegas Roll, the Hawaiian roll, and the Chicago roll. The last of which was not my favorite thing in the world because it was pretty bland. On the other hand, the Vegas and the Hawaiian rolls were both great.  One major complaint that I have... I want a straw with my beverage next time, please. Another thing, the staff is nice, but not really personable. It was pretty busy, though.

I will never understand how this establishment made it onto any TV show about good diners, dives, and whatever.  I've only had one experience here, which means that my judgement may be a little harsh, but I hated my food. I ordered a pulled turkey sandwich, because I'm not a fan of any form of pork product. The turkey was dry, and was obviously being drowned in bbq sauce in order to try and cover the course texture. I barely got a few bites down before giving up.  The decor is interesting. It is eclectic, but not in a way that matches.   Our waitress was really nice.  It's tough to say if I will ever go here again, it's probably safe to say no, but who knows? I may give it ago another time in the future.

Let me tell you how much I love Texas Roadhouse.. or maybe I shouldn't because I could go on forever.   As far as chain restaurants go, this has to be my favorite. So let's discuss why; first and foremost, THE BREAD IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER HAD. No exaggeration. I could eat that stuff all day. I don't care for the cinnamon butter stuff too much but my boyfriend really enjoys it.  I used to only get their caesar salad, (which by the way is amazing too) but then I finally started to branch out and try other things.  I have not been let down yet.  Another awesome thing about this place is that the employees are all super nice and friendly and you can tell that they don't completely loathe their jobs... which is nice.   So, Texas Roadhouse, I will continue to dine here with you for many years to come.

Chicken and Waffles DO NOT BELONG TOGETHER. Ew.  I understand that the world probably thinks I am the scum of the earth for giving Lo-Lo's such a low rating, however, I cannot bring myself to like greasy, nasty food.  Why is the Kool-aid flavored red? Why is it not called "Cherry"? These are the questions that haunt my dreams.   Not only do I hate the food here, but why is it in the middle of no where? I had so much trouble finding it.  You may be wondering why I even bothered to come here in the first place... good question.   It is safe to assume that I will NEVER step foot in this door again.

I flat out love this place. The Happy Hour here is probably one of the best Happy Hours around this area.  The pizza is delicious. The bruschetta is amazing. Some friends and I went to Pullano's for lunch a few days ago and decided to try the Pepperoni chips (which I guess is a new appetizer they've got going on), anyway, if you're one of those people who will pick off the crispy pepperoni on your pizza and eat those first, this appetizer is definitely for you. They also have these really great buffalo mozzarella sticks. YUM!  Anywho, the staff is friendly and pretty fast.

There are really no words to describe the vastness of the selection in this store.  They have almost everything you could possibly need to create any type of art! The far drive, for me, is worth it because they have pretty good sales on supplies. The staff is all really cool and they are super knowledgeable.

I think I would spend all of my hard earned cash here if I didn't force myself to stay away. I love Zia. I always find really great deals here. I shop for everyone's birthday presents here, so long as they are into music, movies, and such.  I throughly enjoy the fact that they now have an extensive book selection. The fact that Zia sells new and used products really makes me happy.  I absolutely adore the vinyl section.

This place reminds me of my Grandma's house, because she is such an antique fanatic. There are so many cool things here making it really easy to spend hours just looking through these pieces of history.   Some of the items give me the chills because they have an eerie sense about them, which just makes it all the more fun to go and check everything out.  The attendants are really nice and helpful.

My best friend and I came here one day, on one of our "monthly shopping loops", because she heard it was really great. Whoever she heard it from was correct.  They have so many different brands, it's really a skater's dream in there. The prices are pretty steep on certain things, but I don't mind paying them for a local business.  The sales are great and the employees are hilarious and super nice.

I love you, Marquee Theatre.   Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed.  I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee. The bartenders are really friendly, the bouncers do a great job, and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal. Not to mention, the sound guys do an awesome job.   I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there.   The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks.   All in all, I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time.

Look here Buffalo Exchange:  You only accept ugly clothes.   I have had so many friends bring their clothes here and they reject every single piece. Every once in a great while they'll find a "treasure" in all of our clothing that apparently isn't unique enough to become Buffalo material. Why will you not accept cute clothes from Forever 21, yet you will sell Volcom Stone and Billabong?   Another problem that I have... you would THINK that a clothing exchange store would sell their clothing for much cheaper, however, you're robbing the poor hipsters who shop here blind.   Thanks, but if I wanted to pay an arm and a leg for clothing that someone else has already "broken in", It better have been by someone famous that I give two hoots about.  The only reason why I give you even two stars is because I do love your jewelry selection.  Okay, end of my complaint.

I remember first going to Sun Camera when I was a freshman in high school. Eager to start my first photography class ever, I bought a Minolta X-700 SLR....still continuing with my passion for photography, today I shoot mostly digital, but I still (when I feel like shooting film) use that camera.  The employees here are all extremely helpful and really nice. I come here every so often still to get my Ilford B&W 400 speed film. They have a decent selection of films and a pretty vast selection of cameras for those who are looking to buy new or used.   I love this shop.

Drifting away from the corporate "Big Dogs" of the coffee world can sometimes seem challenging. After only three visits to Lux, I have found my anti-drug (or should I say anti-coporate coffee shop).   It's true that I have only tried a few things from this small establishment, but when every single one so far has been a success, why wouldn't I continue to venture 35 minutes out of my way to get a good cup of joe? I love almost everything about this place; the atmosphere is so cozy, artsy, and seems to be an awesome workplace for college students. The coffee drinks that I have tried have all been fantastic, but most of all I LOVE their whipped cream.   My one complaint about this simple, yet wonderful establishment is the parking lot. I almost died trying to get out of their the last time I went, although I guess that could be more of a reflection on my driving rather than the parking lot shape/location.

So Mexican-Asian fusion sounds disgusting.  The first time I ever tried it, in fact, I hated it, yet a week later, I couldn't stop craving it. A fair warning was given by my friend, Sean M. that I wouldn't be able to resist it.  Teriyaki Chicken Quesadilla... YOU SHOULD NOT WORK.. but somehow, you are one of the best tasting creations known to man. Chino Bandido, you are so good.... you are so good that I am WILLING to eat there even though I know 45 minute to an hour later my stomach will be growling as loud as a mountain lion.   The service is speedy, I like that you write your order on an order sheet and hand it to the cashier where you immediately pay for your food and then you take your seat. They come out a few minutes later calling your name so that you can receive your aluminum tray full of deliciousness.   I really dislike your snickerdoodles. Blech.  However, I can definitely see why Guy Fieri loves you so much, Chino Bandido.

My 21st birthday was spent in Vegas, and in the duration of my trip I visited House the House of Blues twice! I couldn't ask for a better place to have gone for my birthday! I love the House of Blues.  This one isn't the first one I've been to, although, I do think that this is probably my favorite one so far. The food is really great here. I love their caesar dressing, and the chocolate cake is to die for.  The drinks are moderately priced, just like the food. HOB is just a great place to come and relax on a lazy Vegas night or to come and jam out with some of music's biggest names to date.  It is usually packed, so it is a good idea to have someone arrive about 30 minutes early to get your name on the list. I love the decor, the giant tree in the middle of the restaurant, especially. The Dia De Los Muertos theme is really great, too.  I shall return to you, House of Blues.

I could eat at Carly's every single day of my life and still never get tired of it.  I am amazed at the wide array of drinks that they offer as well as the extensive food menu that offers vegetarian friendly items. Sandwiches, salads, soups...it doesn't seem like a complicated menu, however it is very unique. Some of the sandwich combinations are things I would have never thought of in a million years, yet they are extremely tasty and fully of flavor.   I am very partial to the Turkey Melt, but the boy I'm crushing on is allergic to poultry, so when I go with him I will stick to the Pear or the Caprese.   The art is always changing in here! Every time you step foot into this place it looks entirely different, because the art is from a new artist they are featuring. You can buy the artists' work, if you please. I love looking at all of the works done by different artists around phoenix, it sort of gives me inspiration when I paint myself.  Anyway, Carly's is in my top 5 places to go... if you can top that Turkey Melt I will be thoroughly shocked.

I have been this Buffalo just a few times. However, I always enjoy my time here. The fact that they stay open late is a definite plus. Recently I made a trip here for my sister's 20th birthday celebration. Her friends, being the sneaky snakes that they are, got the waiters to bring her a peice of cake and sing to her (which is something they don't normally do). She loved it. The entire experience was great. The waiters are friendly and the food was really good. Usually I order the medium boneless wings and the southwestern dippers to start off with. I can't say much for their alcoholic beverages, despite the fact that I am now 21, I've never gotten a drink there. The happy hour menu, is pretty legit.

I give credit where it is deserved, so thanks, Sean M, for introducing me to this place.  I love Cornish Pasty Co. The entrees are almost like hot pockets, which excites me. Normally when I come here I order the Eggplant Parmesan Pasty. It is so delicious! I could probably continuously eat them even though I am stuffed! No, Tabatha, you need to contain yourself.   The service is great and friendly. I really love to come here.

I love Rio Vista. It is a huge park fully equipped with a recreation center, skate park, volleyball nets, baseball fields, etc. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous. Being a amateur photographer, I love to bring "models" here so that I can shoot them.   The park is really nice and kept up.

Why am I reviewing Taco Bell? I like this particular Taco Bell because it also is a combined Pizza Hut.  I like to get pizza on the go when I am in a hurry, so this is pretty convenient for me. What I do not like is that they ALWAYS mess up my order here. I can't even count how many times I've had to walk back into the store and ask for them to fix it.  One time, they asked me to pull in front of the store to wait for my pizza because it was still baking for about five more minutes. If I wanted to wait for my pizza I wouldn't have come to a FAST food joint. If you don't have it ready, tell met that so I don't have to wait and be late getting back to work. Anyway, I ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes before I walked into the store just to find out that they completely forgot about me. I had already paid and everything!  I do love that they have Mountain Dew Baja Blast at this location.

I like this place. Scratch that...love this place. Sushi is definitely in my top five favorite foods and Kabuki does it right.  This little place is tucked into a small plaza, and is never too busy, however, the service is always really great. A lot of the people who work here went to high school with me, so it is kind of refreshing to see some of their faces!  The food is superb. I absolutely love the "Rock 'N Roll" and their "Vegas Roll" is one to brag about. They have a pretty vast selection of saki and a full bar.   The only thing I would not recommend here is their White Russian. Ick. Normally they don't come in such tall glasses, and this one is just overkill. Too much of a good thing is never a good thing.

God save me when I walk into this store.   On top of the hundreds of dollars I already spend at this store on a monthly basis, I would have no problem shelling out hundreds more.   I hate you forever 21 for always having cute items and being so cheap. It seems that you make it impossible for me to resist anything I walk by! Another reason I hate you; you're too big! I can't find anything in specific unless I have a good 4 to 6 hours on my hands to waste.   I do love you, however, for having nice employees. I have only encountered one rude employee, as for the others they are all friendly and very willing to help you out.

My rave starts here:  I love everything about Switch. From the food to the atmosphere, the place is simply wonderful.  I've only been a few times, but I've enjoyed it each time. I usually get the turkey sandwich with cranberries on it (the official name escapes my memory).   I can't say much about their Happy Hour or drinks in general, because I have not been since I turned 21. However, I will have to make a stop in soon so that I can check that out.   I love their servers. Being a waitress myself, it is really easy for me to spot servers that are "fake", and the servers at Switch all seem to be genuinely nice people who enjoy their jobs.

I have a love/hate relationship with The Clubhouse. I LOVE the fact that the majority of my favorite bands play here, however I HATE the fact that it is completely unbearable in there during the summer. I went to see some friends play a show last night and even though it isn't quite summer yet, it was still extremely humid and hot in there. Understandable, though, because the show was completely sold out.   The alcohol selection is pretty good, it's funny to see people drinking the fancier beers there. It's pretty spacious, but I feel like it would be even better if the bar weren't smack-dab in the middle of the floor.

I am all about Yucca Tap Room. (Except your parking lot. It sucks. I feel like I almost always scrape my undercarriage of my car on those speed bumps because I forget they are there). Anyway...fun, live music, awesome service, and the ambiance, while dive bar-ish, is inviting. It's a cozy environment with two rooms to separate the bar/restaurant from the live entertainment. Let me tell you why I LOVE places that do this.  I am a music fanatic. However, there are sometimes those days where you go somewhere, like Yucca, or any other food-serving bar for that matter, and you just want to eat. It's AWESOME that I can still watch the live entertainment on the televisions they have propped on the walls while still being able to hear my friends speak. Sometimes you just have to separate the ones who came for the show and the ones who came for the food.  Speaking of the food. Bar food. I mean...how good is it going to actually get? At Yucca, I have the pleasure of saying, it actually gets pretty good.   But it's still a bar... right? Yes. So the drink specials are quite comparable to other bars as well. I have to say, I do enjoy me some Yucca Tap Room. It is a place that I will continue to frequent providing I am in the area, or if I have a friend's band playing there and whatnot.

I despise this place. Cheese curds are disgusting.  I think this is literally the only place that has ever made me fear that I was going to go into cardiac arrest after leaving.  I haven't tried the custard, which is supposedly what they are best known for, so I can't rate it on that level, but the food is really gross.

My dear Pita Jungle:  You always make me so happy when I eat here! I leave so stuffed, but I can't get enough of your food.  If it weren't for your falafel, I would have given you 5 stars. I really don't like it, because it is too crusty for my tastes.   However, your hummus is some of the best around and I really love your broiled chicken pita/broiled chicken salad. My sister always enjoys your cheesecake after her meal, as well.  It makes me smile to see that the servers can wear virtually anything they want. Besides that, I've never once had bad service.

Can we please just change their name?  The few experiences that I have had at The "Good" Egg have been horrible. The food is never good and I feel like the waitresses really loathe their jobs. The one time I did have an extremely nice waitress, the food was the worst. It seems like it is never a win-win with this place, but rather lose-lose.   I doubt I will ever think about going back here, but in the rare case that I do, I will hopefully have a better experience.

My favorite thing about all of the Two Hippies restaurants is the lemonades. They are so fantastic.   I love the beach house specifically because I love that I can sit outside on the eclectic deck and eat my tasty beach food. I love the chicken quesadillas here, I could probably eat about six of them in one sitting, just because they taste so darn good.   The staff is awesome and funny.   My advice, though: Do not come to this specific location on a school day around 3:00. All of the Xavier students are just getting out of school and SWAMP this place. It's already extremely crammed in the front of the building. Do not put yourself in a crammed building with 25 15-year old school girls... it is extremely hard to move.

My first impressions of things can sometimes prove to be a little off. This, again, has been proven after my first visit to Francesca's Collections. Upon first seeing the store, my thoughts were, "Middle-aged woman boutique". I did not even think about stepping food in this establishment until about  3 weeks ago. My best friend and I were out and about and we wanted some food from the delicious Blu Burger Grille, which just so happens to be VERY close to Francesca's. We thought, "why not?" and when we stepped into this glorious establishment, we fell in love. My impression, was completely and totally off. The women who work here are extremely nice and very helpful. In fact, one of them even helped my bestie decide on a dress that she bought herself for her birthday. On top of the friendly clerks, the clothes in here are so cute and a lot of them are WELL MADE knock-offs of huge designers.  Personally, I hate knock-offs that look so incredibly fake, because it's just like saying, "Yes, I am too lazy to bother to look for a knock-off that looks way more legit, even though I know they are out there".  Anywho, now that I am done ranting, I just want to reiterate, one more time, that Francesca's is amazing.

Seriously?  Oh my gosh. I can't even. Comfort Food.   It's so good. Okay. So my first time ever going to Tuck Shop, I was like.. I don't know about this random little restaurant that literally is tucked away...But then I tasted the first bite of the appetizer and immediately realized the mistake I had made by pre-judging this adorable little restaurant.   Like I said... little. It's pretty small inside, but ALWAYS busy. How can it not be busy with food that tastes so great and amazing wine specials to match. It's like Tuck Shop was invented for the sole purpose of making your mouth happy.   I need to stop. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. The stuffed dates are perfect. If you decide to try Tuck Shop, do yourself a favor and try them. The Beef Cannelloni is fabulous as well. Mac and Cheese. OMG.   And, although I am NOT a chicken and waffle kind of gal, it is so good here. I couldn't help but want to order it again.   Needless to say, Tuck Shop is easily a favorite and one that I will be returning to in the near future.

If you read my review for the other location in Tempe, you know how I feel about this place.   I have a love-love relationship with Cornish; there will never be any hate. Never once have I been disappointed in the food and I can honestly say I've tasted 3/4 of the pasties on the menu.   Do I have an addiction? I think it's safe (and probably best) to say "yes".   Their new appetizers that were just released this summer all sound quite delicious, however, I have only tried the Jalepeno Cheese Dip with Pastry Curls and I was impressed.   Usually have awesome service here. Of course, considering the fact that my boyfriend, my roommates, and I were here at least once every couple of weeks, we were bound to have one bad experience as far as service goes.   I will not hold that against you, my beloved Cornish Pasty Co. All of the wonderful experiences make up for that one not so great one.

Let me just start off by saying that I despise country music. That being said, it is really a good thing that Toby Keith's also allows other bands from other genres to play there. The stage is nice and located right in front of a nice dance floor which people were taking advantage of while I was there.   As I have stated in previous reviews of mine, I am pretty huge on ambiance, and I really love everything about Toby Keith's. The bar is huge and centrally located between the tables and the stage. The selection of alcohol is large and the bartenders are super friendly.   The bathrooms are really really really clean... in case you were wondering.   I love the little Jack Daniel's set up they have.   I have not had the food, but it looks delicious.   Overall, I like this bar. I probably won't go back though unless it is on a night that a country band is not playing.

Although today was my first  "check in" at Blu Burger, I have been there several times. Today, however, was unlike any other.  Normally when I visit BBG I down a turkey burger with a side of fries and I still somehow manage to shove a pizza cookie down my throat. Today I was lured to try the portobello mushroom burger... I will never eat a turkey burger from BBG again. Aside from all of the delicious condiments that you can choose to put on your burger, the portobello is marinated in a great balsamic dressing, which leaves it absolutely juicy and perfect. I did not even bother to ruin the luscious flavor with other condiments.  Every time I visit BBG the staff is warm and welcoming. They are very fast and your food never takes too long to get to your table. It is a great place to hang out with friends or even go on a date. Needless to say, my "check in's" at Blu Burger will continuously grow.

This isn't the worst place I have ever been, but I really don't like the atmosphere. It is dark and dingy in here, and to top it off, it isn't really decorated like anything. I am really big on ambiance and I feel like The O2 Lounge doesn't have any whatsoever. The drinks are okay... but I have definitely seen better bars. It's nice if you're just looking for somewhere close on the westside.

I've officially had the pizza now. I have to say that it is actually some of the BEST pizza I have ever had in my entire life.  I actually woke up this morning craving it. The crust is super fantastic.  I am really boring when it comes to pizza; this meaning that I either only eat plain cheese or I will get a pizza with one item on it.   Someone once told me that getting plain cheese pizza is the best way to judge whether or not a place actually has good pizza. If you load it up with all that junk you can't taste whether the sauce is flavorful or the crust is good. I am here to say that Mellow Mushroom is the real deal. Their pizza is great even without all of the toppings.  I have heard that the specialty pizzas are phenomenal, so despite my normal behavior, I will have to try at least a few of them.  Mellow Mushroom, I will return for your tasty pies.

Yes, I work in an Italian Restaurant.. however, I LOATHE Italian food. So knowing this you may automatically assume my first thought about going to a place like this. Boy was I shocked when I realized I actually liked their food!  My Dad decided this was the place he wanted to try for his birthday dinner. So, it was decided then... we packed ourselves into the car and took about a 15 minute trip... (this is a short trip for me, as anyone who knows me will tell you I am willing to travel REALLY far for good food).  Upon arrival we were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. The server was very tentative... this may get on some people's nerves, but not mine. Our drinks were never empty and our food was delivered to the table very promptly. The server also suggested things that he liked and explained some of the dishes.   Anywho, the food was delicious. I had the marghertia pizza and to start off with, the hummus. The portions are plentiful. My parents had salads and my mom had some eggplant dish and both of them were quite impressed as well.  Overall, this joint was wonderful and I plan to go back sometime soon.

I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks.  They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if that's what you're into. I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel "art" is pretty interesting and unique. This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here.  The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out.

I like Dillion's a lot. I constantly crave the Arizona Turkey Sandwich, but I always substitute the cheese for cheddar. The mashed potatoes are great.   Enough about that, though. I really dislike Lake Pleasant, probably because I have almost been bitten by a rattlesnake there and because I think the water is beyond disgusting. So, really, the only thing that I like to do when I come to Lake Pleasant is visit Dillion's. I actually do like that you sit outside in the fresh air (which kind of smells like fish, but you acclimate to it). The food is just as good here, if not better than all of the other Dillion's locations.   It is really nice to be able to wander the docks when you're finished eating, too, because it is sort of a little work out.

In my top 10 restaurants of all time. Hands down.  I've made several ventures to this establishment starting about 3 years ago with my best friend, Andrea. Since then I have tried a decent amount of items on the menu. I have NEVER been disappointed.   Meatloaf: the thing everyone hates when their parent's tell them it's what's for dinner. Not the case if you've ever ordered Ma? The Meatloaf! at CD. The meatloaf has got to be the thing I order most frequently. It's moist and is served with Mashed potatoes and greens. I am in love.   Aside from my love affair with the meatloaf, I could ramble on all day about all of the other amazing dishes Culinary Dropout has to offer. (Especially those pretzels with fondue).   The aesthetics of the restaurant are incredible as well. I love the big chandeliers with the eclectic furniture all while being mixed with a wooden-topped bar. It's absolutely gorgeous and perfect for a date, hanging out with friends & family, or even a business meeting. The best part is their dress code is casual.   The wait-staff is always pleasant. Always willing to suggest entrees to new guests (like my parents just the other night) and are very attentive. I like the fact that they can pretty much wear whatever they want to wear to work in as well.   I have to say, I am not surprised at the quality and perfection that goes into this restaurant, considering Fox Concepts has always hit home runs with my taste buds.

So perfect.   The Pink Cadillac Cupcake is to die for.  I have made several trips to Sweet Daddy for numerous occasions, including birthdays, anniversaries, and sometimes just simply because I wanted a cupcake. My entire family is a fan.   I have tried quite a few of the different cupcakes that are offered here at Sweet Daddy. As previously stated, though, that Pink Cadillac cupcake is flawless. The owner had actually suggested it to me once when I visited. Overall, though, you can't go wrong with any of their cupcake deliciousness.

I like this bar.   Seriously. Karaoke. The theme. The boxing ring. The games. And the drinks are so cheap.  Honestly, this bar is perfect. If you read my reviews, you know I am not one for hanging out in bars that are overly crowded (Sorry. I like to have my personal space to myself). The Duce gets pretty busy, however, it has the floor space to handle it. It's a pretty large bar with a couple of different areas to hang out in. This is awesome because if you want to dance, you can. If you want to hang out with friends and chat, you can. If you want to go browse the random marketplace that is attached... you can...... random. But whatever. I do have to say that this bar will continue to be one that I will return to.

I just love being 21. I feel like my world is completely unrestricted now... except for, of course, the fact that I still can't rent a car or get into area 51 to see what they are really hiding.... however, gambling and drinking are two of my new favorite hobbies.  Normally when I go to a casino I drink a ton, but I didn't drink much at all at this resort. My friend ordered a Cherry Long Island Iced Tea... UM... BEST INVENTION EVER. The bartender completely pulled this one out of thin air. It was so good, though (because I had a sip). The bars are fully stocked with almost every type of GOOD alcohol imaginable. The casino is really nice and the rooms are even nicer. Talking Stick Resort is absolutely gorgeous. I love the patios outside at night, because they overlook the pool and the warm Arizona air makes it a completely surreal experience.  There are a bunch of tables and a lot of slots (which are totally my favorite). Friends were winning and it was simply a great time!

I attended an event that a friend puts on every wednesday here called, "What Happened Wednesdays" and I had a ton of fun. The bar is intense and I love that there is another one across the room too. It wasn't too packed, which is nice, but at the same time there is a ton of room in this building. I enjoy the atmosphere. The bartender was okay... he made my friend's Long Island Ice Tea way too strong (and she only drinks girly drinks where you can't taste the alcohol). The other staff was really friendly and kept asking us if we needed anything.  I will update this later when I try their food, but as for now, Zendejas you are a solid 4-stars.

I've been here several times and I've always had great service. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is great.  I like that you can go here casually or even on  a date. The pizza is good, but not the best. Their appetizers are really good and they have a pretty extensive list of wines and alcohols.

It's 8 AM and I am on my way to school, there is good old faithful Mickey D's or Dunkin Donuts, which one has better coffee??  No doubt about it. Dunkin Donuts has some of the best coffee around. I love that they've even started selling it in grocery stores. I keep getting sidetracked.    So this Dunkin Donuts opened not too long ago, but still they are continuously busy and I've never had a bad experience with them. Their donuts have always been fresh and the service is very prompt. I will continue to get my early morning coffee here because it is conveniently located between my home and the ASU West Campus.

O.M.G. I am definitely a breakfast food lover. I will choose breakfast food over any other sort of food anytime. My friend suggested this morning that we go get brunch at NCounter. I am always on board to try new things.  We pulled up, walked in and I am immediately impressed by the number of people in there enjoying their brunch. I look up at the menu and I am also really happy to see the wide range of things to try. After this trip I want to go back and try them all. This time, though, I decided on one of the "Almost Fried" sandwiches called House Request. It sounded so interesting with multiple types of veggies and with olive tapenade (WHICH IS MY FAVORITE) and cream cheese with an over easy egg. It was so good. I also got a side of the grilled potatoes. They were delicious. My friend and I decided brunch wasn't brunch without some morning cocktails, she got a bloody mary (and since she'd been here multiple times before, she already knew she loved them) and I got a mimosa and it was so good!   Needless to say, I will be back to NCounter to try all of the wonderful things on the menu. Especially that Pecan Cinnamon Roll. It looked so good!

Been here several times now. I can definitely say I will continue to go back. My favorite is the mint chocolate chip ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies. The service is always fast and the employees are so friendly. You cannot beat the price. Two dollars? Is this real life. Thankfully it is.

I tried Rudy's about a month ago with my boyfriend and my roommates. Now, I am not a huge BBQ fan, it's just never been my favorite, however, Rudy's was pretty delicious.   The menu is simply placed on the wall with quite a few options, but not too many to make your decision impossible. You're able to try a sample before you order it if you would like as well.   The pulled-pork sandwich I ordered was cooked to perfection and paired with some really buttery and delicious mashed potatoes ( btw, I am a mashed potato fiend).   The staff is friendly and upbeat and their service is quite speedy.   Rudy's would be  a five star for me if it weren't for the picnic benches. I am all for theming your restaurant, however picnic benches are, and always will be, my idea of a bad time. They aren't comfortable and it's also weird because they're connected, like in a cafeteria. If I wanted to sit next to random people, I would go to a sushi bar or something of the sort. I just wanted to sit with my friends and enjoy my meal without the person next to me honing in on my conversations.   All together, though, I do think I will return to Rudy's for some fine pulled-pork.

As far as Sushi goes, this is probably one of my favorite places. One of my best friends introduced me to Koi, and at first I was skeptical, because she used to refuse to eat sushi. This was one of the first places she'd ever tried sushi and she ended up loving it, so she showed me!  I am so glad that she did, because it is really good.  The servers are always so friendly and they make sure that your drink is never empty, which is nice.  I love almost every roll on their menu. Their drink selection is nice, and to top it off the place is so quaint and cute.

I am an extremely huge advocate for how amazing culinary dropout is. However, this location needs to take a few pointers from the other two locations. I didn't even get a chance to sit down in this restaurant before being treated like trash by their hostesses. The four airhead hostesses that you had working tonight need to learn their job before being sent out into the world of restaurant hostessing.   I've been a hostess. Your job is just that. To host and to be the first and last impression that your guests  have of your establishment. It's not hard to at least pretend to care about your customers.  Now that I've had my rant, let me tell you about my 2 minute experience that left a sour taste in my mouth about this particular culinary dropout location.   Upon walking into the establishment the hostesses just stared and didn't even greet us with a simple, "hello". My boyfriend had to stand there for several moments before they acknowledged him. He told them how many it would be (it was going to be 4) and the hostesses, upon him asking how long the wait would be, responded "I literally don't even know right now." And we just looked at them. Then they go further on to say, "all of the tables we have for the rest of the night are going to reservations, but you can sit on the patio at an open high top." She also told us that one had just freed up and that we could have it. So, without even offering to show us the way, sends us out to look for the open table that supposedly exists. We go out there, no open high top. We walk back to the hostess stand and say to the girl that there are no open tables. She just replies, "oh, sorry. You can sit at one of the couches on the patio.. But it's not full menu."  Oh. Thank you. I didn't come here to eat dinner. (Sarcasm).  When we tell them that we have no where to sit because we want to eat dinner, they again, blankly stare at us and respond with a less than sincere "sorry."  My boyfriend is not patient and tells them we are leaving because they are refusing to even offer to help us find a table. Again, less than sincere, "sorry" as we walked out.   I understand that it is New Year's Eve and that you have a lot of people to accommodate, but your hostesses, instead of standing there at the host stand, clumped together, should be out doing everything they can to try and accommodate ALL of the guests who want to dine in your restaurant. (That includes bussing tables, walking the floor to find open tables, or find almost finished tables). I've been a hostess and a waitress and these girls did not know anything about customer service in the food industry. And even if you can't seat me tonight, at least try and act sympathetic and show me that you're doing everything in your power to treat your customers well. Otherwise you're going to continue to lose customers to Postino right down the road.  Again, I love culinary dropout as you can probably tell by my previous reviews of the other two locations, but this one needs some work. The other two locations have customer service down to a science.
