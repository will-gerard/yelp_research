The food tastes good but the portions are small and the plates are expensive.  The atmosphere is "cute". If you have kids it is hard to guess if they would like it or hate it. (I've seen some kids get excited and others become frightened.)  I've eaten at the Phoenix and Las Vegas locations.... honestly, I could take it or leave it.

Although I think the Phoenix location is more professional, the staff always seems lost or confused.... honestly, I could take it or leave it.

In a single word this place is... AWESOME!  We were up in Phoenix on Wednesday afternoon and stumble upon this little gem right at the end of happy hour. Their happy hour tacos are delicious, especially the tinga tacos. SO GOOD.  Helping ourselves to the fresh salsa bar was a blast. There are so many unique and yummy flavors up there. I think we tried 12 different salsa and absolutely loved four of them. (Not to say that we didn't like the other flavors.)   We then went on to order the the shark, the mahi mahi, the mole and the pibil pork shoulder tacos. I can't say enough about these. The mole was tasty and rich. The pibil pork shoulder was sooooo good. The meat in that one had so much flavor and was just perfect. The shark taco was more like a shark taco with a LARGE side of more delicious shark. Seriously, too much shark for one taco. (Not that such a thing is a bad thing!) The mahi mahi taco was more like a scrumptious mahi mahi pizza. The portions for these tacos are more than enough to keep get you full by the end of the night!  I really liked every little taste that this place offered up. Why isn't this a five star review? Honestly, the service isn't the greatest. It isn't bad service, it just isn't five star service. Seriously, I would over look this little point time and time again if I lived close to this place. The food is AWESOME. Seriously. Check this place out and you will leave full and happy!

This place is awesome.  they are great for both breakfast and brunch. It seems to get busy in the morning, but worth the wait.  Any time I'm in Vegas I make an excuse to swing by here now.  Nothing but good memories and great food.   The red velvet pancakes are amazing.  Super rich and very delicious. The omelets are good too.  I recommend getting both something sweet and something savory, then sharing!   The service here is spot on.  Very friendly and they seem to actually enjoy being there. All the servers wear pajamas. Maybe it's due to the comfort of the uniform or the people at work, but everyone there seems to really enjoy it.

The food was really good. Ordered the Pad Thai, the Panang Curry, and some veggie rolls. Everything was very tasty. The Panang Curry is some of the best of I've ever had. Really rich, creamy, and very tasty. The spice scale is a little misleading. I would have ordered one number higher if I had known that. None the less, it is still really good food. The service here is good, quick, and friendly as well. The location is really convenient if you are attending any events downtown. I highly recommend this place!
