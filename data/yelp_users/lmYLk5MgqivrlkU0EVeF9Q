I've loved your for years through bad food and good food (food is amazing now, btw). Please please please please bring back the booths. I cannot stand sitting in the high chairs,  I don't care what the TV show did to you. Everyone I know hates the fact that the booths are gone.  That is 30% of the reason I come there.

Been coming here for 10 years,  figured I should write a review about how much I love it here.  It has gotten bigger and louder and always crowded but they have never lost sight of quality ingredients from coffee to food to cocktails.    I buy whole beans from here to grind and French press at home.  The pastries,  I live for their pastries. The breakfast lunch and dinners are always killer delicious.  *pro-tip: don't drive the wrong way into their parking lot,  if you do that and try to act like I'm stealing your spot,  I will laugh at you as I park.

The prices are super cheap, buy your spices here. Also, the restaurant is amazing. The beef shawerma sandwich with a yogurt drink is incredible. If you get fries, get the garlic butter dip.

I come here every few years to see if the espresso has gotten better and I get either burnt or lemony. No thanks.

Ok, I tried the drip instead of the espresso this time. It was drinkable. I'm too scarred from the last time I tried the espresso to give it another chance.

Don't tell anyone! This place is an awesome little spot! I couldn't believe how delicious the sushi was for the prices I was paying. I felt like I robbed someone. The chicken Katsu was awesome too!

Tried everything.  It was all excellent, like being invited to someone's home where food is made with love.

I've given so many chances to their espresso. I just can't do it. Too bad, it's open 24/7. :(

The first time I ordered take out here was during the lunch rush and the service was great, I couldn't have asked for better, they even waited for me to get there before getting my lemonade so the ice wouldn't melt, but I wasn't on Yelp at that time, so I couldn't review it.  This time, we called in at 8pm for take out, were told we were going to be connected to the bar to have them take our order, so we hung up after 5 minutes of being on hold, and went to Delux instead.

Tried the spam and burger sliders, both really good. I also like how the fries were actually yummy on their own and not just an afterthought.

The sandwiches were delicious, but super greasy, I was shocked because it used to be so light at the other location. Have they under new management? I really wanted something healthy, and this was definitely not it.

Got my family addicted to this place. It's the only place they want to brunch.  Happiness is a cold brew.  I love their cardamom flavored one,  they have plain and other flavors too every day.  I've had their whole menu and I love everything.

Always dependable on fresh delicious meals, if you're broke,  order the black beans and fries from the sides menu or split a full meal with a friend.    They serve Cartel coffee so if you're sad Cartel coffee downtown closes way too early,  you can still go here.    Loses one star because they raised the price on their fresh squeezed juices and I'm sad about that.  At least half it and sell it for $4ea.   Awesome pastries, try the poptart, you will need thrilled!

We got:   Chicken burrito Meat style burrito but with no meat in it Shrimp burrito, add black beans and rice  Both the green and red salsas that came with our order were delicious. Perfectly done.  The tortillas were out of this world fresh, fluffy, heavenly. I could eat the tortilla plain and be happy.   All the burritos were delicious, I tasted them all. The shrimp burrito was what I  ate and I couldn't put it down, I inhaled the whole thing.   Mexican coke with real sugar in it was the icing on the cake.   We ordered take out over the phone and they got the order perfect.  I also want to note that although the burritos were very filling, they were not greasy at all, just perfectly cooked like a healthy meal you'd make at home for your family, but they wouldn't know that it's healthy by how amazing they tasted.   When I was craving burritos earlier in the day, I had never been to this place before, but they tasted exactly like my imaginary burrito tasted.   I'll definitely be back. The man working in the kitchen was very kind and seems like an awesome  human being.

Awesome beer on tap selection,  love the food.  Potato tacos are killer good.  Got the torta tonight & the garlic dipping sauce was such a good pairing. Lemonade is awesome too! Chili cheese fries are awesome too! Fried guac is a dream.  Desserts are killer good too! Adorable atmosphere, way better than being at Super quiet grandma's house feel of the cafe that used to be there long ago.

Food is delicious! Just simple delicious food,  like getting invited to a talented friend's BBQ. Hopefully they'll start having parties soon to match that newly acquired liquor license.  It's a beautiful space and although the Hidden House can never be replaced,  something beautiful can be here again.
