Dr. Kozinn is alway pleasant and I enjoy my appointments with him. He always listens to my concerns and answers all of my questions. His staff is friendly and always accommodating. Some doctors are on their own schedules but he seems to value being on time and my schedule. I would recommend him to anyone in need of a knee doctor.

I am currently having my pool built by Bloom design. So far they have done a great job. We worked with Steve the owner and he is very easy to work with. I would definitely recommend him. I will update this when my pool is complete. Hope I will still feel like giving them 5 stars. :)

Was looking forward to authentic Mexican food... The Guacamole was fresh out of a package topped with pre-shredded generic cheese and black olives fresh from a can. Fresh avocados are not hard to come by right now. Veggies on the side were right out of the freezer. Also the bar had a line and only one bartender for the entire restaurant. They might soon be on an episode of Restaurant Impossible if it weren't for the ever changing customer base that comes from the Arizona Grand and other surrounding resorts.

Okay, so I am a little bit of a sandwich Junky. I absolutely love this place. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because my favorite items keep changing. I am the type of person that when they go out likes to go to a familiar restaurant and I order the same thing practically every time, because I know I have less risk of being disappointed. Well as many times as I have been to NOCA I have yet to have a disappointing trip. Yes, on a rare occasion they have run out of things, but I can appreciate that because I know the food is always fresh. They have won me over with their soups and sandwiches, I can't wait to try dinner.

Wow, where do I begin... I had booked a flight with Allegiant Air and this was the first leg:  This morning I was trying to get a on flight to Eugene, Oregon out of Mesa Gateway airport to attend my Grandmother's funeral.  A week ago she passed away, and I had made reservations on your airline to go home. As I have done many times in the past and I also encouraged my brother and his new wife to do so as well. Your website recently started to charge $5 to print boarding passes at the airport. To avoid this you suggest downloading the app, so I downloaded it and loaded my reservations in to the app and assumed I was good to go. When I got to security I was unable to pull up my boarding pass. (Unaware they turn off the "check-in" button 60 minutes before the flight!) This was 45 minutes before my flight left, and I was not checking baggage. The security agent asked me to go get a printed boarding pass. When I went to the ticket counter, the manager Becky said she was unable to print me one because I was within 60 minutes of the flight time. Visibly upset, I begged her to print it. She refused and told me to leave. I tried again to explain the situation, but she said if I didn't leave she would have the police remove me. So now thanks to Allegiant's policy I have missed my flight home to attend my Grandmother's funeral. Please share with your clients that there is a check-in button that will disappear 60 minutes prior to the flight... Oh and my brother and his wife whom I rode to the airport with, went through the line and checked baggage onto the flight managed to get through security without any trouble.   On my return flight...  I get to the airport and everything seemed to be moving smoothly. I had gotten my electronic boarding pass through their crappy app, which I strongly suggest you still screen shot and print one... then I heard over the loud speaker that the flight was delayed. Two hours later we were loading the plane and again I had trouble with their app. Thank god this time I had taken a screen shot! We all took our seats, backed away from the terminal to find out we had a mechanical issue and later the flight was cancelled. They promised vouchers and told us to go to the ticket counter... No one was there. Since we were through security there was no returning to speak with the gate agent. Once we made it to a hotel in the area where we found an available room, we got a text letting us know our flight was delayed... LOL Wow this airline sucks!!! Don't do it... you don't save money because you pay for hotels, other flights and days of missed work. You will be sorry! #allegiantsucks
