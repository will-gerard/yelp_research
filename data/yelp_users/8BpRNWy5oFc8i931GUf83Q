One of my favorite pizza places.  The location is understated as it is in a strip mall but it is not a reflection of the quality of food or atmosphere inside.  Great wood fired pizza and wine list.  Its a great place for a casual dinner with family or friends.

This place was a total surprise.  It is absolutely delicious.  The food is fresh and made right in front of you.  We went with four people and all ordered different things and all of it was absolutely delicious.  It can be pretty spicy but they let you decide the level of spice which is really nice.   I had the seafood corn chowder and it was amazing.  The jumbo is really good and the pan roasted dish.  The oyster shooters are a fun way to stat the night.    They don't take reservations and there can be a line.  I'd recommend going early around 5:30 or so.  Unfortunately it is in a smokey casino so you'll have to deal with that.

Canteen is a great place for food and drink on Mill Avenue.  The place is spacious and the crowd isn't just the college aged crowd.  There is a great mix of people of all ages.  The bar menu is extensive, especially if you like tequila.  The food is also really good and they have a great happy hour.  Canteen always throws great events and parties.

Went here on Sunday evening around 7:30.  It was not busy and we sat on the patio.  The guacamole with crab was great and so were the tacos.  We had the pork and the short rib tacos.  Highly recommend the short rib tacos.  Others on the list looked great as well.  The service was great.  We will return.

Tried to like this place and have given it numerous chances. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have always had a bad experience. Service is poor, food is not good and overall the place is overpriced for what you get. There are small, basic things that could be changed to help this place out. Tempe could use a great wine bar with dog friendly patio.

Love this place when coming to Vegas. Great food, prices and atmosphere. Know they recently had some issues and closed a location but I'm sure they're even better now.

Called and was immediately put in touch with Brian who quickly scheduled a time to come re-key my home.  Brian showed up exactly on time, was very friendly, courteous and performed the job quickly. Cost of service was extremely good.
