The service was efficient & the staff was friendly, attentive, & knowledgeable on the ingredients. The atmosphere was comfortable. The food itself was fresh, tender, & melts in your mouth, but the sauce for the eel was a little stronger than normal.  They have a cool Japanese style way to celebrate birthdays!

The work was a LITTLE slow, but, like ALL "good" places, they are busy, but you REALLY can't beat the prices and the good HONEST feeling that you aren't being taking for a ride, but, rather, they are taking GOOD care of YOUR ride!

Not a good place. WAY over proceed for what it is, just a COMPLETE waste of time. Just go ANYWHERE else

I will say this, the place won me over. When we first arrived, I was put out by the complicated & difficult to understand menu. There were lots of terms I've never heard of before (like pork jowl), so it took me a while to figure out what to order. I ended up going with the smoky. And, while the coffee was quick to be made, the only sweetener they had was this really weird stuff in a green package. But after about 10 minutes, the food arrived and then I could see why the place got such good reviews, the food was excellent! And the staff was very friendly!  Pros: *  excellent food *  very friendly staff *  an amazingly little surprised treat (see picture) *  coffee refills ARE free, even though that's not obvious  Cons *  pricey, this place is at least $$, if not $$$ *  bad sweetener for the coffee *  confusing menu *  you pay for your good & tip BEFORE you can evaluate how the service is, so, here's a tip, pick 0%tip when offering & leave the top in cash at the table  Overall, the most important part of any restaurant is the tastiness of food, followed by the service you get, and in those 2 categories, this place Rocs the Casbah!
