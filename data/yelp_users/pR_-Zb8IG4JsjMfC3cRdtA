I've been practicing yoga for several years now, have tried many studios, and this place, BY FAR, has been my favorite.  Hands down.  I'm getting sad writing this review because I've recently moved out-of-state and miss it so much.  There is SUCH a variety of classes and teachers.  So many different styles and levels of yoga, plus tons of workshops and teacher training opportunities.  My personal favorite teachers are Marie, Josh, and Maredith... they are incredible and inspirational, and always made me feel better both spiritually and physically.  At one point I was driving past 4 closer yoga studios just to take one of their classes... because they're that good!  Convenient class times, fair pricing, informative website, lovely staff, and good locations.  Appropriate and helpful adjustments, plus the occasional massage pre-savasana.  Learned something new or bettered myself every class.  Thanks Inner Vision, I'll miss ya!

Magen nail is my favorite place to get my nails done.  I started coming here from the deal that was offered on yelp, and I have returned for all my nail and pedi needs ever since.  The place is super clean, which is most important to me.  Any time one of the staff is not busy helping a customer, they are busy cleaning, organizing, or practicing nail designs.  They all work very hard and are super friendly and flexible with whatever you want done.  They have the best prices around and the widest selection (BY FAR) for gel colors.... there's probably a hundred colors, and they're happy to show you the newest colors they've just received.  I get acrylic tips with gel polish and they will last up to 3 weeks without breaking or needing a fill.  I'll just do a regular pedi with french polish, and I'm always happy with what I get.  I'd recommend this nail salon over any other place in the area--great prices, great service, and very clean.  And very little wait time, if any.  They also have a punch card that saves you 20% after you fill it up, woo!  Go Magen Nail!!

Someone already said exactly what my first line was going to be... but seriously, this place is a GEM.  I've been coming here for years and love it.  This place is definitely a dive bar, but it's clean and super spacious. I'd say there's about 15 tables, and you can always find one open... free pool for a couple hours every day, 50cents per game, or you can play by the hour.  Cheapest drinks in town, hands down.  The bartender is awesomely friendly (seriously, I LOVE her), and the owner is there every day and he is also awesome.  Tons of parking, clean bathrooms, you can watch whatever you want on TV, pinball, big patio, and you feel safe.  Weirdos every now and then, but where isn't there? Bright lights, but better than the flashing lights and crazy loud music and overcrowdedness down the street on Mill.  Join a pool league, and tip your bartender well, please!

This is the best pizza in the world.  Seriously.  I feel like that's all I have to say.   But I will say more. As far as the pizza goes, I've only tried the Mama Spinato's pizza because it's so good that I can't get myself to try anything else... probably because it's just perfect.  The flavor... the texture... oh God.  Salads, breadsticks, cheesesticks, and calzones are also amazing.  And TRY the pumpkin gelato that's seasonal--it's TO DIE for. Also, great, quick, friendly service.  They box everything up for you, and offer you giant to-go cups for your drinks even.  My mouth is watering right now.

I've been here twice now for car repairs, and I couldn't be happier with the service and the prices.  This is the first and only place that I've been to for any type of car service (car washes and oil changes) where I feel like I'm not treated like an idiot by someone who's just trying to get more money out of me. Tracy is awesome; he's treated me with respect and like a friend.  Customer service like I've never seen.  And when have you EVER gone to get car repairs with an estimated price in mind, and they charge you LESS than what you expected? Mindblowingggg. This place is just amazing.  Thanks again, Tracy! :)

Best mexican food everrrrrr.  Seriously.  Not as greasy and more authentic than Fiibertos.  Fast and friendly service, great prices, and it's always clean.  The decor in the dining room is pretty hilarious, but all the more character it adds I guess.  My favorite part is the vegetarian options.  Try a veggie burrito with added potatoes (they're not actually just potatoes but more like tiny french fries), put a little red AND green sauce in it, and get ready for heaven.

I went here today for some coffee and maybe something to eat.    The door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.  Getting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.  I walked up to the counter and a girl said "hi," I said, "hi," and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... "so is this your first time here?" would have been nice.  Just silence.  I ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though.   I went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading "dirty dishes," that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.  The owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out.

Just as katlyn O. said, the store itself is great for selection and prices, but it's the worst customer service I've ever seen.  The people who work here have no knowledge whatsoever about any of the products they sell and have seem to have never crafter or sewn in their lives.  They always act miserable and I have heard them speaking to each other countless times complaining about their work days there. I'd probably enjoy shopping there more if they had self-check out and a way for you to cut your own fabric.  They don't even pay attention when you ask how much fabric you want cut and have screwed that up at least 3 times for me.  I special-ordered some scissors the other day, only for them to tell me that they lost them after I waited for an hour while they searched and were very rude to me.  If this wasn't the only fabric store in town (besides SAS which is only good for some things), I'd never shop here.

Love this studio (I'm including the Chandler studio in this review as well).  My favorite thing is the variety of classes and the abundance of class times also.  I have a very full and busy schedule and I can also usually find a class that fits into my schedule between work and school and everything else almost every day.   There are I'd say, at least 20 different class types (styles of yoga) that you can choose, but my favorites are the "Inner Vision HOT Flow," the Level 1-2, and the Power classes.   Definitely sign up for a new student special... unlimited classes for two weeks for $29 dollars.  That way you can see what classes you like, see what teachers you like, and see how often you'll be going... that way when you do sign up for class packages, you can see which one would be financially best for you. Both locations are great though.  I love the lakefront view room at the Chandler studio, and the reception area of the Tempe one is really nice, inviting, and relaxing.  I go to both about equally depending on which teachers and classes I want to take.   Also, the website is super helpful.  You can purchase classes that way and see which teachers are teaching at which times... teacher bios and great yoga info and faqs in general.

Such a cute place with awesome food and service.    I went here for lunch with my mom and it was a great experience.  We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted, and the boy working was more than happy to fully explain how the menu worked and any item on the menu.   We played some cards while we waited, and every person working there seemed to be upbeat and happy. Food was great and there was a TON of it.  So yummy.  I'll be ordering takeout soon I think.

Um, is this place a joke?  I really don't understand how this place has so many good reviews.  I came here because it seemed popular, and had a pretty good rating on Yelp.... but I really don't understand how... maybe all the ASU kids are impressed by the modern interior design?  Maybe they're sick of their meal plan food?  Or maybe people are just hungover and any breakfast food tastes good...  Anyways...  -The service was awful.   Not one single person had a personality or even a glimpse of a smile.  There was about 20 people "working"... but doing absolutely nothing.  Workers were just aimlessly wandering around the dining room, standing behind the counter in a daze, or fist bumping their friends talking about how wasted they got the previous night (no joke).  -The place was a mess. There was food and garbage ALL over the ground.  The drink station countertop was a sticky disgusting mess... spills, lemon seeds, used napkins allll over it.  The place was pretty busy, but any empty table was still covered in the previous customer's dishes and food mess.  (Which I didn't understand since there were 3 workers wandering around the dining room at all times).  I had to flag down a dazed employee and ask them to clear a table off for me.  And of course he just wiped even more food onto the already disgusting floor.  Seriously, food ALL over the floor.  Gross.  -The food took forever and was cold. We waited about 25 minutes for a super simple order of food.  I got the Farmer's Market.  The whole entree was cold.  And NOBODY likes cold soggy potatoes.  It was supposed to have avocado on it, but it had one mere sliver.  My boyfriend's food was also cold, and he didn't eat it.  We would have said something to someone... about a refund or getting at least warm-ish food instead, but everyone was too busy wandering around in a zombie daze, and at that point, I just wanted to get the hell out of that disgusting place.  And there was awful music playing... like music that plays really loud in a club.  Like loud Britney Spears and hip-hop.  It was just weird.    I would never come back here, and would advise anyone (unless you like cold food, disgusting places, and awful service) to try another place for breakfast/lunch instead.  Ew.

Meh.  2 stars for the concept and the service. I can really appreciate a restaurant that tries to use local and organic food.  That's really important to me.  And the service is great--the waitresses are super friendly, and the owner is always there, checking up on guests and making polite conversation, seeming genuinely interested on what his customers think of the food.  Well, here is what I think Mr. Owner:  the food is not that great :(  I feel like nothing had ANY flavor whatsoever, and every time I've eaten there, I've waited for about an hour for my food.  And once after waiting for an hour, I was brought out the wrong dish.  And it tasted like it came from a can.  Le sigh.  Like I said, I really really appreciate the concept and the friendly service... buttt the food isn't great, and takes forever.  Sorry : /

My mother has been coming here for three years, but after her most recent experience will never be returning.   She was three minutes late to an appointment but because there was someone waiting in line in front of her, by the time she saw the receptionist she was ten minutes late. The cold and rude receptionist told her she would have to reschedule because she was late. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE WAITING ROOM.   My mother basically BEGGED to see the doctor snd was coldly turned away. She left the office flustered and on the verge of tears, without rescheduling because she was so upset after traveling so far to go there and being turned away.   NO ONE HAS CALLED HER. She's on several medications and suddenly stops seeing her doctor and no one even calls to reschedule of see if she'd okay? Is the doctor not concerned that she might just suddenly go off her medication?   My mother has seen other patients turned away for just being a few minutes late. A young girl with her WHOLE family there for support who must have been going through something difficult to have the support of her whole family with her. They turned her away even after her parents mentioned that they had to request off work for the appointment. So cold, and so wrong.   I am DISGUSTED by the way this office treats people. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
