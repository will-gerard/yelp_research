My favorite dog park in the valley. Lots of great owners and dogs. Let's start with just getting to the park. I've never seen the parking lot full even on the busiest of weekends when softball games are going. So great parking. The park has 3 different areas. 1 area is always closed to regrow grass which is nice. There is an active area and a passive area. Entrances are double gated and also have separate gates for if you are leaving or coming inside. Once you are inside the grounds are maintained pretty well. I've seen a few times that mud puddles have started from over watering but that is very very rare. Each area has its own little play area. One has a small selection of agility training objects. 1 has a series of tubes that your dog can jump up and go through the tubes and the last area has a series of boulders to jump on. Dog owners are attentive and pick up after their pets. Although you will see the occasional poop in the grass. So watch your step! Also on the active side I've been happy to see some knowledgeable dog owners who know the difference between play fighting and an actual dog fight. My dog is the most playful dog I've ever seen and enjoys doggy boxing leading to a game of chase.  The only negative thing about the park is the water fountain. Water pressure is horrible and also there is only 1 fountain in each area. On nights and weekends when it is super busy there is a giant crowd of dogs trying to get some water.

Not sure where to start with this place. There are 2 areas. Large and a small dog fenced in area. That is all this place is to me. A fenced in plot of land. This dog park doesn't seem to be run by phoenix. It is run by dog owners. Let me explain. At this park inside the fenced in area there is no water source and there are no bags for poop. Dog owners have pitched in and brought a giant bucket to fill with water. They also bring and leave grocery bags so we can pick up poop. Go dog owners! Phoenix should be ashamed to have this be one of their main dog parks. If you look around at the entire park it is huge and has nice grass. Inside the fenced in area are little spots of grass with lots of dried up mud in between. Also another problem is there are a lack of seats and shade. You have to take cover under the 2 trees and that is it for shade. The people were good, dogs were good. Park was disappointing on many levels and I won't be going back.

As a daily hiker with my dog I am always amazed at how nice it is to have this gorgeous park within walking distance of my apartment. Concrete jungle surrounds this place on all sides and we have this big oasis to enjoy in the middle. Beautiful sunsets from hole in the rock or just from the top of one of the buttes.  I suggest going on the trails near the Phoenix Zoo. Also head on up to Hunt's Tomb which is the pyramid looking thing on top of a hill. From the top you can look in on the zoo and see giraffes and the big horn sheep.  This park has some ponds where you can feed ducks or go fishing. Also a great place if you want to have a big ol family cookout. There are plenty of places to just chill with the family and cook on a grill.  Only con to Papago Park and the reason I gave it 4 stars is the amount of trash and broken glass that are all over the place. On the Tempe side of the park you can literally just step on glass shards as you try and climb to the top of a butte. No sign of any gravel underneath you. Just shattered glass. Not sure what could be done about it. To many stupid kids climbing to the top of the mountains drinking and thinking it is funny to throw their beer bottles off the cliffs. Place is in need of a serious clean up in some spots. If you stick to the designated trails you will not need to worry about the glass though. Enjoy the area and pick up after yourselves.

This is a decent size dog park for the amount of 4 legged guests that come. Double gated at the entrance which is something I always love to see at a dog park for safety. One negative about this park is the mud. There is one particular section next to a nice tree that is just continually one big mud puddle. Would be nice to see them block this area off for a week and plant some grass. 1 muddy dog could mean trouble for the rest of the dogs. There are various benches and tables scattered around, poop bags are readily available from dispensers and tons of tennis balls laying around for you to toss around. As far as the 2 legged guests I can say I've had positive experiences with every dog owner I've encountered. Some are more social then others. My dog is very high energy and loves to play fight and chase with other dogs. Never had an over protective owner say anything. I'd recommend going to this park if you are in the area. Just keep them away from the mud.
