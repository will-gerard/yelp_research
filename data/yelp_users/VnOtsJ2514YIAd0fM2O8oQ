I'm still looking so this rating may change, but out of the four shops I went to, these guys really impressed me with their friendliness and willingness to find out what I wanted to do with a bike. One bike shop I went into just looked at me and pointed out a cruiser, which is NOT what I want (although I am older). So will either go here or Sun Cycle to make my purchase. So far, Sun has been awesome and it's closer to my house.

I searched for a bike and hit most Phoenix major and some minor bike shops. I was very impressed by one, but ultimately liked the bike and the customer service at Sun. Joe helped me and made sure the bike fit my needs and was accessorized appropriately. I'd definitely recommend Sun to anyone looking for a bike. The location is excellent for those of us in Central Phoenix and he took time to explain to me why I needed extra thorn protection. I always need help being protected from life's thorns, don't you?   Seriously, I'd recommend Sun without hesitation. Also, the other staff were very helpful, harvesting my brother's old bike of things I could use on my new bike.

My friends like this place so I occasionally go to hang out. The food is never great and the service is iffy sometimes. Admittedly, we are a large group, but the service tonight went like this: (Pardon the fact that I am a meat eater.)  I ordered the steak sandwich and my friend ordered a Delmonico. The waitress brought us both Delmonicos and I said, "I ordered the steak sandwich." She said, "You said "Delmonico." I said, "No, I didn't," politely because it's not that big a deal. She refused to acknowledge that MAYBE she was wrong. Just insisted that I had said Delmonico.   Is or is not the customer usually right, even if they are wrong, which I wasn't? I didn't make a big deal, just paid the difference and brought the rest home. But I don't recommend the place.

I took my two a bit difficult German shepherds in for a bath and nails and they did a great job. They also said my dogs behaved well. I'm sure they lied, but it made me feel good.

I wanted to transfer two of my dog's RXs from another store to CVS for the $25 promotion they offered with these transfers. The pharmacy assistant refused to honor it at the pharmacy because I didn't bring the coupon. I asked the manager if they would honor the gift card without the coupon and he said, sure, "Tell the pharmacist I said it was fine." I did, then the pharmacist stalked over and chewed out the manager and came back and said, "He shouldn't have told you that!"   Customer service rule #1 violated: Don't argue in front of customers.  #2: Don't be rude to customers.    My other prescriptions will remain at Walgreens.

Home Depot replaced my less than two year old washer with a new unit after I complained about #Maytag's abysmal customer service and Home Depot's initial  fumble when I complained to them looking for help with Maytag. Woo hoo! I'm a fan.

I wouldn't take my German shepherds any place else. Dr. Y is honest, about 1/2 to 1/3 cheaper than another vet I tried closer to home, and an excellent vet. He is one of the few vets who can do hips/elbow x-rays for OFAs without sedation. Two paws up!

Another home run with Dr Yocham. Had to have my wonderful male neutered. Doc was concerned it was more than prostate issues and guided me through the difficult decision (he is a working dog (Oz, not Dr. Y) and we don't normally neuter working dogs so all you crazy people can please not bother chiming in).   We decided to go ahead and it appears it was the right decision. He charged MUCH less than another quote I got and spent time with me both before and after the procedure to discuss his findings and help me make the decision. Dr. Yocham is "old school" and in my book, he totally rocks.  I trust him. What more do I need to say?  Back again today, 4/26/13, for hips and elbow xrays. They whipped my dog right up on the table, no need to sedate her, got the shots and voila, her hips and elbows look fine. I love Southside Animal Hospital.

For heart attack, drop dead chicken and the best waffles I've eaten in years, Lo-Lo's rocks. LoLo's catered a breakfast for a non-profit I am involved with and they did an awesome job. However, our mission is good health and preventing work disability, so unfortunately, the others in the group have outlawed Lo-Lo's for future events. It appears we have to actually practice what we preach. Bummer.

Remember the emissions debacle of 2/7/11? I just took my truck in to renew the tags and IT PASSED EMISSIONS with flying colors. Back to Basic fixed it TWO YEARS ago and it's still fixed. My truck is a 2000. That tells me B2B does quality work that stands the test of time. Love you guys.

We shopped for engagement rings from both two national stores (that advertise like crazy) and two local jewelers. Ultimately we wanted to support local business. This jeweler gave me an amazing ring at an incredible price. He also included the appraisal (can you believe some stores don't?).   They have been in business since 1946 and I bought a ring from them 25 years ago that was beautiful, but this ring is simply stunning. They are more wholesalers than they are retailers, which may explain the customer service dings they've gotten from two reviews. However, they treated me and my fianc√© very well.  I highly recommend them.

Went to another mechanic and every time we try someone new, we return to Tony. This time I took the car in for an oil change and a "look over" and the estimate for new brakes was $2,100. The whole truck isn't worth $2,100. We took it to Tony, who smiled at us and then fixed our brakes for about $400. We love Tony. We decided as much as we like to patronize other local businesses from time to time, we're sticking with Tony.

Frank at All About Time did an amazing job restoring my grandmother's grandfather clock. It took several months between fixing the cabinet (dinged from a few moves) and restoring the clock, but it arrived today and is chiming away as beautifully as it did twenty years ago. A few little issues came up with the time running slow, and Frank called me right back and walked me through the issues. Very great guy! I highly recommend this shop.

Time and again (yesterday and today for example), AAA responds promptly, courteously and efficiently. I can't say enough good about them. I've been a member for years and can ALWAYS rely on them. Because I travel to Prescott often, I upgraded to the 100 mile version. I had to be towed from Skull Valley to central Phoenix and it only cost $40 with the additional miles. If you don't have a roadside service membership, I'd recommend you look into it. It's worth it's weight to me just in terms of peace of mind. They have battery service, as well, which saves a major hassle (yesterday they were there in like 20 minutes). Whatever they're doing, they're doing it well.

It rocks. Some of the best Med food in the valley. Took two of my friends there last night and they really liked it, too. Except for the part of getting pulled over by the Tempe police for temporarily stopping in the bike lane, an excellent evening was had by all.

I had an old folk art oil painting I dearly loved. Drug it all over the US when I moved, then moved one mile and poked a huge hole in it. I was heartbroken. Arizona Art Restoration to the rescue!  For a mere $60 she made it look fantastic! Fixed the hole, cleaned it up a bit and fixed another area where someone had tried to clean it and pulled off paint.  She is awesome!

I hired a "friend" to redo my sprinkler system and it became like something out of Jurassic Park. I have known the Manning family over the years, but didn't think to call them before I hired the Bozo I did. They came and retrofitted the mess he made and since then, which is about four years ago, they are my "go-to" sprinkler people. They are the only sprinkler people I recommend. Family owned and wonderful people.

I bought several pairs of glasses from them: always stylish, friendly service and high quality. In fact, tomorrow I am going to buy my fourth pair from them. I find their prices competitive and good, European well-made frames.  Really like them for glasses and they'll bargain on cost. Going in the next few days for my first eye exam there. Will let you know what I think.

Sav-On Plumbing recommended George Chartier at Air-Zona air conditioning. I've used him twice and he is awesome. Last night on one of the coldest nights in the Valley in my recollection (and I was raised here), my heater bit it. When I woke up this AM it was about 55 degrees in my house.  I called George at 6:30 and he was here at 8:00 and had it fixed almost immediately. He didn't try to tell me something terrible was wrong and I needed some expensive fix. He merely reset what had tripped and vacuumed out all the dog hair. Sigh. He is awesome. The bill was quite modest, as well.   I can't recommend this company more highly.

After my debacle with a certain glass company, this company stepped up to the plate and ordered me a used window. They also fixed a few other issues I was having, including an exhaust leak and a window that was worn out and would no longer roll up and down. They are really great and also fixed another issue we had with a second vehicle (free!). Roger is awesome.

Between Flo's on 7th and White Dove, I can almost completely outfit myself year round. And as you know, Crusader Rabbit is a fashion icon--NOT.   White Dove has great clothing sales and cool, pretty high-end furniture and clothing. I arrived at the right time one day as they were unloading an almost new awesome chair and ottoman in the perfect shade of maroon. The manager priced it for me at $60. What a steal. It's in my bedroom even as I write this, covered with freshly laundered  thrift sale summer clothing I have nowhere to store. I don't think I've ever sat in it, but I know it's comfortable.  I also kick myself every time I go there because I missed buying an almost new paddle boat for $100. What WAS I thinking?   For Central Phoenix gals, this is a convenient stop and always worth the trip.  P.S. Be sure to go around to the back across the parking lot where most of the clothing is. It's worth the walk.

Wow, the chicken was too burned and they charged me $1.99 for grilling the tomatoes and onions but didn't tell me. When I objected they just said, "Oh well." Not for me. There are too many other good Med places in Tempe.

I, too, love the Slope. I was raised near Northern and Central and now live where my streets dead ends into the Mountain Preserve.  I have a home-based business and can ride my bike or walk almost any time I need a break.  Houses are older but most solidly built. Lots of Boomers live nearby and the neighbors are open-minded and mind their own business. Most keep their houses up and even the recent rash of foreclosures sold quickly to families.   I can ride my bike to major stores and it's convenient for my friends to drop by. The Slope has my vote!

Vlad was referred to me by Tom of Sav-On Plumbing in Glendale. He came within one day of calling, very professional and honest. This was an oven repair of a broken oven light. Instead of ordering the part, which would have increased the cost by $50, he fixed the part I had. I was very pleased.  Vlad is a national treasure and I'll definitely use him again and refer others to him.

The replacement guy came out, removed the rear window knowing the replacement glass probably wouldn't fit, then told me it would be three months until the new glass came in but they would wrap it with plastic. In the meanwhile, I now have a truck I can barely use for three months, and it's a theft risk and my dogs can't ride it in because they'll put their faces through the plastic. When I called the manager to complain, he admitted they knew this might not work but never informed me before they took the glass out it would be three months before they could get a replacement. This is a cluster. Their solution? I should "call around" because I'm "welcome" to find an alternative to the problem they created.

I bought two of the same bras (really expensive) and asked if I tried one for a few days and it wasn't as comfortable as possible, could I return the other unworn. The salesgirl said "Yes." So today I take back the bra and guess what, it's a merchandise exchange only.  I asked why they didn't say that, and the salesgirl said they aren't "required" to inform people of this. I am now stuck with a credit at a store, once I spend the credit, I will never patronize again.  I find the Soma fitters actually much better fitters. The first bra I bought there, also EXPENSIVE, had straps that continually fall down. How fitted is that? This place really bites.

Oh Lord! Can they get worse? It just goes on and one. They can't seem to remember to mail me the checks for my new account nor waive the service charge so it seems I have to call each month to get it waived. I'm disgusted and will start looking for a new bank soon. I'm not that big of a business so I think only a credit union will be responsive.  Update 6/1/13. Oh Lord, it CAN and DOES  get worse. Today I went in and the safety deposit box I took out two weeks ago is suddenly "not in my name." That's right, they've lost the contract. Good thing I was only toting things to put IN and didn't need something today like my PASSPORT. Additionally, they keep charging me the checking service charge although that was supposed to be waived. And they never sent checks for the account I opened six weeks ago despite phone calls and promises.   What is up with this bank? Oh yeah, and NOW the service charge is non-negotiable because the bank was bought, although when I opened the account with the service charge waiver, BMO already owned the bank. Basically, I'm moving my business to my credit union.

It gets worse yet again. Three weeks on a new account, no pin #s for the debit, no checks (they were printed today I find after talking to the branch manager). My stupid self should never have trusted them for a new business venture but now it's one thing after another. Never again. I'm going to see Deanna Jordan at Comerica Bank as soon as we straighten out this mess.

I talked to a regional VP-type of customer service relations a few days ago and she can't help me. I went to Comerica and in five days had the credit I needed and the cards in hand. Unfortunately, I'm severing a long relationship with the BMO Bank. That's four accounts and many years of trust. They just don't have the same expertise and willingness with small business as I'm seeing at Comerica.
