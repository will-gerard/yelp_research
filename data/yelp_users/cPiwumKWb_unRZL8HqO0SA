I stop in about three times a week to this location and I am always satisfied with the speed, price, cleanliness, and friendliness of the staff. I know with a certainty that I can get in and out with my order in under 5 minutes, which other restaurants do not share the consistency.   I am mildly obsessed with the bagel sandwiches...(insert Homer Simpson thinking about donuts) I prefer the ham, egg, and sharp cheddar on a cheddar jalapeno bagel. I know, I know, I really need to stop being so health conscious. HA!

OH man, I really hope the Apple that we all knew didn't die along with Steve Jobs. I have noticed a serious drop in customer service since his passing over a year ago, and this location has been the indentifyer.   I have 7 Apple products that I use regularly, so I am a bit of a fanatic. For the last 3 years I was given AMAZING customer service, as the staff would just replace broken parts for free even though I was outside of the AppleCare timeframes. (This very reason made me fall in love with Apple as a company).   Now within the last year, I have had two problems with my products (broken optic drive, and broken iPhone home button) both of which i was required to pay full price for. Now, I do not mean to imply that I always expect free service and replacement, though it does seem to be correlated with the transition of the company.   Other than this issue, the staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful. It just seems as though the higher-ups might have clamped down on the "homie hook-up".

I've always preferred Basha's over Fry's simply for the reason that it has a small town vibe. Prices might be a little higher than Fry's and the selection is probably a bit more limited, but the customer service has always been great for me and I never leave unsatisfied.

Barro's is the place to go if you want inexpensive high quality pizza in a relaxed atmosphere. They have the best bubbly crust (I always go for the slices with the biggest bubble...not sure why) and the prices are definitely fair.   One complaint that I would have is about the staff. From what I can recall, I've never seen an employee that doesn't look to be in high-school. The high school students can be a bit apathetic and absent minded at times.  The restaurants are always clean and well-kept, and they even have a limited draught beer selection.

I just had the worst experience I have ever had at a retail store. I have little knowledge of electronic components and came here in an attempt to gain a bit of information from the sales staff. I was met by a SUPERVISOR named Michael. He acted as if I was wasting his time from the start, as he was half on the phone and half helping me, and was INCREDIBLY rude. I asked a very innocent question: "I am looking for a small motor, can you help?" to which he responded angrily, "How am I supposed to help you when you don't know what you're looking for?!" I was taken aback. He then proceeded to tell an employee to "Just go away" because he was not offering his assistance. I felt bad for the other guy; his boss is clearly a total oppressive asshole. I then said "Never mind" and walked away, but he then realized the urgency of the issue and demanded that I follow him to take a look at the inventory. I begrudgingly went with him and he proceeded to almost mock my lack of knowledge. It took everything I had to not smack the guy. He had the audacity to say as he walked away, "Let me know if you have any FURTHER questions."  I stormed over to the manager on duty who apologized profusely for the mix up, but based on how easy it was for Michael to be such a jerk, I absolutely cannot imagine this was his first time acting this way. The MOD apology meant nothing to me, as it blows my mind why a person as awful as the supervisor can hold a position of power. I will NEVER step foot in this building again, and I beg you to do the same. Absolutely horrible experience all around.

I know, I know,4 stars for a Taco Bell location is absurd because it is fast food. However, this particular location has the BEST customer service I've ever experienced at a fast food joint. I've come here about 10 times and I leave smiling every single time.   When you pull up to the drive-thru menu, you're met with a very pleasant "Hello! How are you today?" The guy running the drive thru is truly an inspiration to fast food service. My meal is always on point, and never sloppy. Of course it is only a Taco Bell, so it is not gourmet cuisine, but who can afford to have bistro food every meal? When eating fast food, make sure you get the best experience you can and I recommend this location for just that.   I will try to get the name of the specific guy of the drive-thru and I'll post it later!

This review is primarily for the Wine Cellar and corporate offices.   The Cellar-Master is awful, arrogant, and condescending. I've been a long time customer of this and other AJ's throughout the valley, and have spent HUNDREDS, maybe even thousands of dollars on premium liquor at their stores.   I've been on the hunt for a particularly hard-to-find liquor, even ensuring that my name was added to the running "list" for distribution (I was told I was #3 at one store, #2 at another). Long story short, I didn't get the bottle I was waiting for...even though both stores received well over 3 bottles each. Each time I visit the store or call in to check on the shipment, I'm treated like a child, and given an eye-roll and sigh for even asking. This is ridiculous. I'm trying to spend over $300 on booze and I get this kind of customer service?? Terrible.  I was offered no explaination as to why I was passed over on the lists, instead I was given a "tough luck" and "maybe next year" from the CellarMaster. I wrote a long winded complaint letter to corporate a week ago and still have heard nothing back. I've even left voicemails with the Managers but haven't received any call back. I honestly expected a prompt response with at least an apology, but after a week of no response I can't help but bring my frustrations to the public via Yelp.   Please avoid the wine cellar at this AJ's as best you can, and save yourself the frustration of having to deal with an grumpy, self-righteous "cellar master".

I stop in at Taco Bell about once a week, typically going to the one on McClintock & Ray. Today I was in a different part of town so I came to this one instead. The service was typical for a drive-thru, but that surprised me as I was under the impression that ALL of Taco Bell was pushing for better customer service.   The location on McClintock and Ray always has AMAZING customer service, with the drive-thru attendant genuinely asking how your day is going and occasionally throwing out a joke but always offering a smile.

UPDATE:   I received a very friendly message from the owner of Boulders, who apologized for my previous experiences with the food, and offered a free meal with recommendations. Instead of using the free offer from the kind owner, I went back to the restaurant and ordered BOTH of the suggestions that he had: The Asian Bob burger, and the California Carver pizza.  The burger was incredibly juicy and had a nice balance of sweet and savory. Two thumbs up.  The pizza was a crazy amalgamation of all that is yummy: Pepperjack cheese, onion strings, pico de gallo, turkey breast. The serving size was more than adequate for a single person and the taste was great!   Add these two great menu choices with the endless (and ever changing) beer selection, and Boulders on Broadway is a hit!

I have always had a deep fondness for petite coffee shops. Solo Cafe is what I've been searching for in the Tempe area for years now. Upon walking in, you are met with interesting artwork on the walls, comfortable couches surrounded by books and even a record player with headphones for a little personal getaway. The staff is quick to welcome you in, but in a very sincere way. The menu is very all-encompassing, ranging from simple black coffee to some very exotic teas. The prices are about average for local coffee shops, but the payout is in the presentation. My "barista?" took the time to draw an intricate design into the foam of my small hot mocha, which was served in a classic white mug and saucer. I was very satisfied with the temperature of the coffee (not too hot, not tepid) and I enjoyed reading about the Bauhaus art movement. Highly recommend this shop to someone on the go, or even a student who needs to hunker down and study in a calming yet social atmosphere. I don't hand out 5 stars often, but they deserve that rating.

The weather is cooling down, and wearing a long sleeve shirt is about to be the norm. What goes better with cool weather than a hot bowl of soup? A hot bowl of Pho with meatballs and brisket from this place! This was the best Pho that I've had in Arizona; the broth is flavorful, meat cooked to perfection, vegetables fresh and green. The staff was incredibly friendly, offering small cups of soup as a sample, and even offering my girlfriend the opportunity to change her order if it was not to her liking. (She was a bit braver than I and got a more traditional Vietnamese bowl, which she LOVED) The restaurant was clean, bathrooms were nice, and they even had the UofA football game on the tv! I highly recommend this place over any other Pho restaurant in town. Check it out!

Poorly organized, run down buildings, unfriendly staff at every turn. I will try to stay away from this place as much as possible.

I really wish I had the option for a 4.5 rating. The Cornish Pasty, Co. has been a date-spot as well as a casual hangout of mine for years now. The best thing about the Pasty (pronounced "Pass-Tee") is not only the amazingly simple food, but the elegant atmosphere. Where else can you dine under candlelight without feeling like a chump? The lighting is dim and beautiful, the surroundings simple yet quaint. You can get the full story behind what a Pasty is inside every menu, and I recommend reading about it! Interesting stuff! The prices are very consistent throughout the menu, typically being around $9 per dish, which is very acceptable considering the density and beauty of the food.   The staff is typically friendly, with the occasional "I'm having a bad day" server. It can be hard to tell who is a server, as they wear simple street clothes, but I believe this adds to the welcoming feel that the owner, Dean, has established. Apparently renovations are to be coming soon, with the restaurant expanding to almost double the current size. I'm anxious to see how this will affect the overall mood of the place, but also excited for change.   There are no TV's here, so don't expect to go watch a game. You do however have a nice range of beer and wine choices, with a limited liquor selection. I was told that the bar will expand with the addition.   Date? Go! Hangout with friends? Go! Take mom out to dinner? Go! I can't think of any circumstance that this place doesn't cater to. (oh yeah, and they also actually cater to parties as well, which I believe can be requested through their website http://www.cornishpastyco.com/menu/index.html along with a full menu.  Give it a shot, you won't regret it!

This location of Dunkin Donuts is on my way to work, so I stop in quite frequently. The staff is typically pleasant, with the occasional "bad day" employee which is why I have given them a 4 star instead of 5.   The food/product is always consistent and the store is very clean and organized. This location is particularly efficient, with what seems to be an endless client base of corporate-grind people who need their donuts quick and their coffee even faster.  The coffee consistently wins awards and has been voted higher than Starbucks. I believe that their coffee is a bit sweeter than it needs to be, but the pricing is a pleasant relief from the shameless gouging of Sbux.

Awesome little yoga studio with a very friendly staff! The class size was tiny and the instructor was able to give good one-on-one coaching. My downward dog still sucks, so I need all the coaching I can get.  Unfortunately I am not familiar with pricing here, so I am unable to comment on that.

I've been shopping gyms lately and stopped in to Anytime Fitness to check it out. I was greeted by a very friendly staff who were very concerned with my needs. The gym has a relaxed vibe, as opposed to Lifetime Fitness which can seem like a bee hive. The pricing seems fair, machine and free-weight selection is great, and the place is not too crowded. The only reason the gym gets four instead of five stars would be that the locker rooms were very simple, when compared to every other gym out there. I would have preferred a bit more space, as I'm sure it can get very crowded (in the locker/bathroom).

This little place is awesome! Meat Market is a great little shop that carries only vintage clothing for both men and women. Prices are surprisingly great, considering the small but excellent selection that they have. I found a couple sweet Members Only jackets and a rippin' old The Who shirt, and only spent about $50. Staff (one dude) was friendly and helpful, and left you alone while you shopped. They even had some pretty hot old-school womens swimsuits...OW OW!

Cute little Thai shop in Downtown Phoenix. It seems like there are a million Thai joins in the area...apparently middle-aged businessmen/women are craving the curry and pad se ew nowadays.   The decor is nice and modern, menu all-encompassing. The server was a little hurried even though we were the only ones eating at the time. I ordered a simple Chow Mein (my bad for ordering Chinese at a Thai restaurant) which came out lukewarm/cold and not spicy at all even though I asked for Thai hot. The prices seemed fair but given that my meal was cold and serving size was a little lacking, I had a hard time coughing up the $25 for the two of us.  Walk about 100 ft to the West and you'll hit a very good Thai place that I've eaten at several times. (Thai Basil)
