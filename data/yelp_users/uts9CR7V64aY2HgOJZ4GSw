I had a great experience with Ray at Parrott Discount Auto Repair. I needed to have a used car that I recently purchased checked out, and after reviewing all the 5 star reviews on Yelp I thought I would give him a try.   Now, I am not a car person, in fact, I dare say I know nothing about cars, so I rely very much on professionals to tell me what needs to be done. After doing some diagnostics of the car, Ray presented me with all things that were wrong with the car, and other things I could do for preventative maintenance. He let me know what things were highest priority, and what things were important but would not leave me stranded on the side of the road if I didn't do them today. He took time to tell me what was good and not so good about the car, and explained things in terms even I could understand. I really felt he was being straight with me, and not for a moment did I feel he was giving me the run around, or trying to sell me stuff I didn't need. It was personalized, honest service you don't see much these days in the auto repair industry.   In addition to everything else, he acquired some new wheels for me, and since they weren't ready to pick up until the next day, he took the time to personally drop them off at my home.   So overall, I would definitely recommend Ray to anybody, and I will be coming back.

I am a huge fan of YC's. I work right next to this location, so we frequent it for lunch. My favorite thing about YC's is not only the fact that the food is fantastic, but they let you pile the food as high as you can. It's always a competition amongst my co workers to see who can stack their food the highest. You just have to buy a $.50 cent to go box and you have lunch for the next day.   The staff is always super friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the variety of food never disappoints. I have absolutely no complaints for YC's.

This is a review strictly for the SERVICE department. We have been taking our Sienna to this dealership for nearly all maintenance ever since we purchased it in 2008 from a private party. As we have always returned for the scheduled maintenance, the van has run perfectly for 3 years now.   One time I went in there because my breaks were squeaking. I was expecting to pay a ton of money. The person I dealt with, whose name I unfortunately can't remember, came back and told me that that the breaks still had lots of life in them, but the previous owners of the car put in aftermarket break pads, and thus the squeaking. It was nice to have a service writer be honest with me, as I know next to nothing about cars myself.   We did shop there once for a car, it wasn't the greatest experience, but honestly I've never had a great experience shopping at ANY dealership, so I won't hold it against them.

The yogurt selection is good, and the topping selection is average compared other yogurt places, but I am NEVER going back there because of their idiotic coupon policies.   My family and I were frequent guests of Aloha yogurt for a month or two, but my last 2 visits there turned me off forever.   The first time I went in because I had a buy one get one free coupon. After I got to the register he pointed out that it was expired. Assuming since they print these same coupons every week, and we were frequent customer's, he would honor the coupon anyways, since I only came there because of the coupon. But he refused. I was upset, but paid. After all, it WAS expired, so while I didn't appreciate it, it was not the end of the world.  The next time I went in there with myself, my wife, 3 kids, and my parents. We came with 2 filled out stamp cards, and 2 non-expired buy one get one free coupons. When we got the register, the cashier announced that we were only allowed one coupon PER GROUP. The coupons clearly said on per person, but they decided to switch things up on us at the register. He would only let us use one of the stamp cards for our group of 7.  Needless to say that is just TERRIBLE customer service. I have been the general manager of a restaurant before, and I couldn't image doing that to frequent customers. So we have found a new yogurt place, and will never go back again.
