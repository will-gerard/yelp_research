Some friends of mine took me to the Wild Thaiger for my birthday.  I can't think of a better place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate.   The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.  The Food and Drinks: Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.  Appetizers: We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.  Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.  Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!  Wild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.  Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.  Hot Pot: We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.  Main Course: I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!  Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.  Desert: OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!  Will I go back? I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.  Hats off to The Wild Thaiger. The best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.

What a great place to walk, learn about the desert flora and relax.  I can't believe that I have lived in Phoenix for over ten years and this is the first time I made it to the Botanical Gardens.  I've always heard it was a wonderful place that is known as one of the best desert gardens in the world.  It truly is a world-class venue.  I guarantee I will be walking these gardens often.  But first I will have to purchase an annual membership because the $18.00 entry fee will get expensive very quickly even though it sure was worth every cent.  The Desert Botanical Gardens cover about 140 acres located next to Papago Park and the Phoenix Zoo. Established in 1939, the garden now has more than 50,000 plants, about one-third of which are native to the area, including species which are rare, threatened or endangered. Several ecosystems are represented: a mesquite bosque, semi-desert grassland, and upland chaparral.  The entire venue is impeccably maintained and spotlessly clean!  I can tell the people of Phoenix take great pride in the jewel of the desert.   The gardens have five trails; the main trail is called the Desert Discovery Loop. Then branching off from this central trail are the plant and people of the Sonoran Desert loop, the Sonoran Desert nature trail, the center for desert living trail and the desert wildflower loop.    During my time spent at the gardens I encountered desert wildflowers, abundant wild life such as humming birds, butterflies, rabbits, roadrunners, ground rodents and countless  varieties of other birds along with herbs and plants used for food, medicine, shelter and other cultural purposes and cactus so many cactus varieties!  The botanical gardens are so well thought-out that the best way to describe the venue as a whole is simply a work of art!  Oh, did I mention there are wonderful works-of-art scattered through-out the gardens.  Right from the beginning, you know this is someplace special as before you even enter the gardens you come upon a wonderful man made rock formation with three incredible Chihuly glass sculptures titled Desert Towers!  There is a lot of walking to be done here but the designers have obviously made your comfort a priority.  There are drinking fountains everywhere, several restrooms, a café, nice secluded / shaded sitting areas and benches along all the trails.    My recommendation is: make a day of this, take your time, look everywhere, take photographs, have lunch at the patio café, drink lots of water (you are in the desert), put on some comfortable walking shoes and enjoy the show!

If you go here expecting to find a "China Town" you will be disappointed.  However, this place does not market it's self as a Chinatown. It is a cultural center which holds special events and displays as related to the Chinese culture. What a great place to relax in the garden. Also has some wonderful restaurants, shops a business center and a Chinese grocery store there.

I went to FEZ for the first time this past weekend. Love the mid-scale urban feel. Both the restaurant and the bar areas are cozy along with a nice outdoor patio. For starters the drinks were mixed to perfection. I ordered the veggie burger with salad and I must say this is the BEST veggie burger in Phoenix and the salad was simple, fresh and dressed with just the right amount of one of the finest house vinaigrettes I ever had. I'm originally from NYC and you might call me a foodie so, I set the bar fairly high and I'm not easily impressed but FEZ has earned my respect and I will be back.

My dog Gavin loves to go to this dog park.    The off leash areas are large, clean, well maintained and comfortable.  There is plenty of plant life (bushes and trees) for the dogs to enjoy and a large open turf for them to run and play.    The park features play areas with things for the dogs to climb on and play around along with water fountains for the dogs. They provide plastic bags and trash cans all over the park to make cleaning up after your dog easy.   The park is divided into "active" and "passive" areas based on the dog's demeanor and play habits. Some people think this should be divided by big dog and small dog but I find this works perfectly fine.  In fact, my small dog often likes to play with the bigger dogs and some of the bigger dogs brought into the passive area would not do so well in the active area. It's all about knowing your dog.   I have found most of the people here to be very friendly and look after their dogs. I have met many fellow dog lovers and my dog has made several new play pals here.   Problems?  Yes, I have seen a few dog fights but very few and the owners jumped in right away.  It seems any problems are really not with the dogs it is usually a matter of the dog owner not really understanding dog nature.    The truth is when it comes to dogs, people need to be trained and the dog will do just fine.  Gavin and I love this park and will continue to make it a part of our routine.

Well, I'll start with the negatives. I found the place to be too noisy for my liking.   Yes, I was there during a busy lunch service with virtually every table in use.  But still the noise level was a bit much.  I think they could have tweaked the acoustics a bit.  Also for a restaurant based on the use of simple, fresh pure ingredients that are locally and or organically grown to create a healthy and flavorful menu; I would expect to find a few more vegan and vegetarian entrees (please note I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, I just prefer veggie dishes). I would also like to see a selection of pure raw food entrees and by raw I don't mean just salads.  Okay, having said that, neither of these issues is a deal breaker nor will it keep me from returning.  Now for the positives; to start off I was told that I would have a five to ten minute wait for a table or I could elect to take a seat at the counter.  I elected to wait for a table and I'm glad I did.  The wait was only eight minutes, so bonus point #1 for keeping with your estimated wait time.  Bonus points # 2 thru 10 go to my server.  Honestly, I forgot his name but on my receipt it shows the server's name as Makyle so I'll assume that is correct.  Makyle was a breath of fresh air, the first thing he served up was a genuine welcoming smile. I can't stress enough how important that is in the restaurant business.  He seemed very happy to work at this restaurant and seemed to have a genuine passion for the place. He started by asking if I have ever been here before and if I knew anything about this restaurant.  When I told him I had never been here and only knew what little I had read. He asked if I wanted to know more and then told me the history and philosophy behind the place.  I found it very interesting and I was impressed by their affiliation with Dr. Andrew Weil and how the entire menu is centered on the principals of Dr. Weil's Anti-inflammatory food pyramid.  Makyle's service was absolutely first-rate.  Possibly the best service I have found in Phoenix other than at a mega-dollar establishment.  Despite being extremely busy he checked in on all of his tables in a timely fashion, kept the water glasses topped off and offered to get you anything you may have wanted like a second drink.  Décor: Bonus point # 11. The décor is very modern-urban-upscale and very appealing to the visual senses. As I mentioned in my opening, they could have done a better job on the acoustics.  Cleanliness: No bonus points. I found it overall clean but with some room for improvement. It looked like they missed a few spots when they cleaned off my table.  Nothing terrible, no sticky mess just not 100%.  So, what did I order and what did I think about it? I started with one of their natural refreshments.  I'm a big fan of fresh juicing and it was nice to see this offered on the menu.  I ordered the Cucumber Refresher and it was just that, very refreshing. Bonus points # 12 thru 14  For my entrée I ordered the Spaghetti Squash Casserole.  This dish has spaghetti squash with organic tomato, zucchini and fresh mozzarella, and is served piping hot (bonus point # 15) in an individual casserole dish.  What can I say, it was to die for, it was perfect, the ingredients and seasoning achieved a perfect balance where you can taste every ingredient without anything overpowering any other taste (bonus points # 16 & 17).  Now I almost never eat cheese so I could have done with a little less cheese on top but even so it was not overpowering the dish. I was hungry and found the portion size just right. I'm glad it wasn't larger because it was so tasty that I would have consumed the whole thing. First rate and I will highly recommend this dish.  The experience was wonderful and I will return.

Upon first pulling up to and entering Luci's there does not seem to be much to like about this place, let alone to get excited about.  However, I decided to give it a try for lunch one day.  What can I say?  I LOVE THIS PLACE! Granted there is absolutely nothing special about the atmosphere and the patrons were not quite as eclectic as I thought they would be (OK I used to hang out in Greenwich Village a lot when I lived in NY).  But the "something special" is right where it counts... The wonderful food and friendly staff.  If you are looking for unbelievably great tasting, organic, fresh and healthy food; this is the place to go.  My first time there I had the Humm-Dinger Vegan Wrap. This wrap had artichokes, zucchini, red bell peppers (all roasted to perfection), fresh and I mean FRESH spinach along with hummus and balsamic. For my side I had the homemade asiago penne salad and an herbal iced tea to drink.  The wrap was by far the best tasting wrap I have ever had anywhere! The penne salad was very good and it was a nice small portion (just the right size).  The herbal iced tea was absolutely full of flavor and the portion size on the wrap was great. If I were hungrier I could have consumed the whole wrap, but as it were I took half of it home and enjoyed it just as much the next day.  Yes, I really do love this place.  I have now been back for a third time and I have never been disappointed. The other dishes I have tried are: The Portobello "Shroom" Burger (absolutely fantastic!) and the Low Carb Gobbler Wrap (again another fresh and delicious choice).  I now look forward to going here much more often for lunch and I want to try their breakfast too.  Something tells me I won't be disappointed.

Kitchen 56 is a neighborhood restaurant with a full bar located in the Arcadia area of Phoenix.  It came highly recommended to me by some of my neighbors.  My first impression upon walking into the restaurant was very good.  I love the casual, clean décor and the place just has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  I was greeted immediately and was seated without delay. I was there for a late brunch or lunch on a Sunday. The place was not busy at all.  There were a couple of people at the bar and two other tables inside were occupied.  I know they have a patio but I did not venture so I don't know how many people were there but there were not many cars in the parking lot.  My waiter came over and took my drink order within a couple of minutes of me being seated and then took my brunch order when he brought my drink.  He was pleasant, had the expected smile however, he never introduced himself so I have no idea what his name is.  I ordered the ginger spritzer for a drink and the three cheese & basil omelet with fruit and potatoes for my brunch order. The order took a little longer then I would expect for an omelet on a not-so-busy day but I took that as a good sign thinking the chef was just preparing everything fresh and with care.   After the waiter delivered my food, he was never to be seen again!  I was also wrong about the expected quality of the omelet.  This was probably the most poorly prepared omelet I have ever had.  Even one of those breakfast-chain restaurants does a better job.  The omelet was over-cooked, there was no sign of any basil in the omelet and it was extremely salty.  The fruit consisted of a dry orange wedge and one average strawberry.  I did find the basil, it was on the potatoes which were also too salty but otherwise cooked well.  I thought about complaining and probably should have.  But I figured my waiter would stop by soon to ask if everything was okay. No waiter.  After several minutes the owner stopped by and asked, my reply was "Do you really want to know?" I told her it was salty and there was no basil in the omelet.  She went back to the kitchen and then offered a free desert which I declined. She then offered to re-make the omelet but I declined that also as I was short on time.  I have to say, she was very apologetic, sincere and pleasant to talk with.  Based solely on her pleasantness and attitude along with my neighbor's recommendation, I will give this place a second chance but there are some obvious issues that she must resolve with her wait and cook staff.  It's a shame that this happened at a restaurant with SO MUCH potential in an up-scale neighborhood. It is these kinds of things that will make or break an independent, neighborhood restaurant.  My check was presented to me by the owner (again, not the waiter) and she only charged me for my drink.  I was grateful and told her she really didn't need to comp the food, so I paid for the drink and about  1/2 of what the omelet should have been. I will go back sometime although Kitchen 56 is not on my priority list right now.  I will hope for better service and food up to the standards of such a nice place.

This is my favorite spot to hang out and just relax in my neighborhood. I am currently away from Arizona and find myself missing the Black Cat.  I highly recommend giving this coffee house a try.  Very friendly owners and staff, great coffee and lunch / snacks.
