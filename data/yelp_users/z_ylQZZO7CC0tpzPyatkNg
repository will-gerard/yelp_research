I have eaten here several times I have tried many things on the menu and I have never been disappointed. The prices are not bad, the food is really good, and the staff is polite and professional. I live on the east valley and I am always finding excuses to drive out to Phoenix to eat here.

I ate here a few days ago for lunch, I got a carne asada taco and a chili reillno. The meat in the taco was dry and had little flavor but the chili reillno was amazing! It had tons of flavor, I was really impressed with it.

This place has a great happy hour. The  drinks and rolls are very inexpensive and are pretty good.

I have promoted shows out of this venue, checked out some of my favorite local bands here, and spent my last birthday here. The owner has always been very hospitable and professional. The security staff is very professional and the bar tenders are always pouring amazing drinks. Needless to say I love this bar anyone who is a fan of live music at intimate venues should like the bar's facebook page for regular updates on upcoming shows.

I went here recently when some family was in town visiting. Nothing spectacular but impressive enough to warrant a review. I don't remember what I got, an omelet of some kind with toast or something and some coffee. The coffee was good and fresh, enough so that it stood out to me. The food was very edible. Not knock your socks off or anything but if you got picky eaters or people that have bland pallets then you should check this spot out.

So I have only been here once and it was my first time at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. I have eaten at a lot of different sushi restaurants around the valley and I must say I was not very impressed. The prices are great, the staff are super friendly and nice, but the sushi was blah. I went with a few friends and we all really love sushi but this place just did not impress. It was a cool experience and I might try and find another conveyor style place to check out but I wont be going back to Teharu.

So I have a pretty critical review of this place from my experiences last night. I just got off of work and met up with some friends to grab some dinner for my friends birthday. As soon as we walk in we are greeted with a rough looking guy demanding our ID's and being pretty stern. I thought I was walking in a douche bag party bar or club not a restaurant. There were two other groups there trying to get in and people handing ID's over top of each other. It was very disorganized and irritating but what ever. We got our ID's checked and our wrist bands so we could sit down to dinner.....  So we got sat and handed some menu's. Our waitress asked for our ID's again and was confused as to why we had wrist bands on. We told her the guy up front took our ID's already and wrist banded us. She walked away real quickly and came back telling us not to worry about showing her our ID's again. We gave her our drink orders and she came back pretty quickly. We needed a little more time to look over the menu so she came back.   I looked over the menu and was not terribly impressed. The food selection was blah but I figured it is a pizza place and their pizza selection was pretty decent so not a huge deal. I ended up getting a spiked sausage hoagie. It was small and unimpressive. It came with chips that tasted like they dumped them out of a lays bag. It was not a hoagie but more just a few small slices of sausage with huge chunks of green bell peppers with melted cheese between two tiny slices of bread. It tasted ok but for $9 I expected a lot more.   The service was slow, like really slow. the waitress could have easily doubled or tripled her alcohol sales if she would have just hustled a little. Our food orders came out one at a time with a few minutes between each plate. Some of my friends split a moderately sized pizza that looked ok, I didn't try it. Another ordered a calzone that was also moderately sized. And the last friend ordered a personal pizza. Everyone was really surprised at how small my sandwich was, I am really glad I didn't get a half sandwich. One of my friends gave me a slice of his personal pizza a BBQ chicken pizza of some kind that was better than my sandwich.   To kind of summarize this entire review the food is alright, the service was incredibly slow, the bouncer/security guy was annoying, and the prices are ridicules. You can go to any other restaurant on mill, even any of the other pizza places and get more and better food for your money. I don't know why people rave about this place at all, makes me think they have no idea what good pizza is supposed to be.

So I live and work right next to this location. It is hands down, with out a doubt, the worst Filiberto's location in the valley. Your employees can't get the simplest food orders correct and have even over charged for specialties orders on numerous occasions. Tonight was no exception. At this point I will no longer go to any Filiberto's location. You claim to better than all of the other "Berto's" but that simply isn't true.

Family owned but no personal touch to the food. If you have been to one generic Hawaiian BBQ place, you've been here. The food is slightly over priced but the service is pretty quick. I really only come here when I need a break from the usual.

The food is alright my only real gripe about this spot and the ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is the price. For what you get you can find much nicer restaurants around town. This still doesn't deter me from going in here when I am in the area. The food is fresh and the people are nice.

I have given this place a try on more than one occasion. I have tried day drinking there and going at night on the weekend. This place is the quintessential fake country bar. I guess you cant expect anything different from a mill ave/college town bar. The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible. The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar. If you're looking for a country bar, this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for another stereotypical college town party bar, this is your place.

Great service and knowledgeable staff. The price was fair and the service was completed quickly. I sent my parents down to get their computer repaired and these guys did a fantastic job. I was out of town and they needed to retrieve some important emails from a computer that wouldn't boot up. I tried troubleshooting with my parents over the phone but you know how that can go. These guys came as a recommendation. I am always leery of sending my parents anywhere because they are always being taken advantage of. Not from these guys. They didn't try and push a new computer on them. They troubleshot the issue and found out it was able to be repaired. Can't thank them enough for taking care of my parents while I was out of town.

I have been here a few times. I have had pizza, garlic knots, and their peperoni rolls a few times. This is probably the closest non major chain pizza place to my house. The staff are all very nice although their delivery takes a long time for as close as I live (Less than one mile from their store front). The food is always very good. Not the best but WAY better then any major chain pizza.

If you like seafood you owe it to your self to go here. It can get a little pricey but it is well worth it. Everything about this place is winning. Staff, atmosphere, its a little tight to navigate through the restaurant especially if you're a bigger guy like me but the food is so good I would crawl through a mound of fire ants to get to a table just to eat here.   The sauces are great, I usually get the milder sauce in the bag with the seafood and the hotter sauce on the side, trust me, the heat sneaks up on you. I always get some corn, a few potatoes, and a couple pieces of sausage tossed in to one of the bags. If you are a picky eater or don't like getting messy, this is not the place for you.

I go here at least 2-3 times a week. It is across the street from work and half a block from my house. The sandwiches are top notch. I have tried all of their American style sandwiches and most of the Vietnamese styles as well. I just got done eating a #1 as a matter of fact. This place is great. I don't really have any experience with other Vietnamese sandwich shops but comparing it to other sandwich shops they are the best. The prices are great ($4 for a whole sandwich?!!!) and the quality is awesome.
