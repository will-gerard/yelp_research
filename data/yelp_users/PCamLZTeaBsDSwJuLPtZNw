Came once before and thought it was OK. To be fair tried again today with my daughter.  Should have stuck with my first impression Still just OK.

My daughter and I went here for the first time over the weekend.  I did not like the seating. I felt like I was at a work conference. My table/tray thing was dirty and chipped and caught my shirt.  We will stick with iPic and the AMC on 24th street for luxury.
