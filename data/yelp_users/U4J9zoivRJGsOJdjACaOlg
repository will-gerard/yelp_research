I fly - a lot - and I have to say that Sky Harbor is one of the better airports in the country. It's one of the highest volume airports yet it's reasonably well organized. I've heard that about 75% of the air traffic flows through Terminal 4 (that's where US Air and SouthWest fly out of).   If you've going to fly out of Phoenix very often my advice would be to start using US Air or SouthWest because a) it's a hub for both of them and b) you'll have much better flight choices and c) because of the competition, the prices tend to be better. The other terminals, by comparison, are nearly deserted. Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices. Terminal 4 has improved a lot in that regard.   There is a lot of parking available, both on site and off site. The off site parking, naturally, is cheaper but you have to wait for the buses to bring you to the terminal. Compared to other airports of comparable size the on site parking is not that expensive. If it's a business trip and you are getting reimbursed for the parking, just park on site and save yourself the hassle. Honestly, the best way to get in and out of Sky Harbor is not to drive at all but to use a transportation service. I'm not talking about Stupper-Shuttle - don't get me started on them - but a real sedan service that will drop you at the curb and meet you at the security gate when you arrive back home.   If you can, print your boarding pass at home rather than waiting in line at the airport. The airline clubs, in my view, are a waste of money. As another reviewer pointed out, the wi-fi access is now free at Sky Harbor. I used to belong to the US Air club but let it lapse. The snacks are not that good, they were charging for drinks. Unless you are regularly connecting through Phoenix how much time are you really going to spend in the airport? Now if you're connecting and have a long layover then it might be worthwhile but otherwise I'd skip it.   I got a laptop stolen here once so a word about security. If you have a laptop computer, put it through the x-ray machine last and don't take your eye off it for a moment. Particularly if it's very busy.

I'm not a big fan of Home Depot's in general and this one is no different. It's ok if you know what you want and where to find it. Customer service is almost non existent. They seem to cater more to the large volume contractor type customer than the home repair guy looking to buy a screwdriver. It has improved a little but they have a long way to go in my opinion. Their lumber selection is terrible. I could hardly find a single piece of wood that didn't look like a hockey stick.   Having said that, the prices are generally good and the selection is very good. Loews gets most of my business these days but your mileage may vary.

I've been going here pretty much since they opened. They had a promotion (not sure if they still do it) where you get a license plate cover that entitles you to a $2 discount on every car wash. They also have annual passes you can buy if you want to maintain a super clean car. They do a good job and the staff are friendly.   The windshield repair guys are a little aggressive though so beware of that. Overall, they do a fine job and I'd recommend them.

Fry's rules! I love going to this place. So much so that I won't even set foot in a Best Buy. The first thing that hits you is the size of the store. It's like a Costco for electronics - the place is huge. Most of their items are very competitively priced but it depends on what you buy and when.   Their computer and peripherals section is very well stocked. They have a good selection and price range for TV's, appliances, movies and electronic gadgets as well. If you're looking for a good camera you might be disappointed. It's mostly low end box cameras that they carry. Good selection of computer books.   The staff, like at most electronic stores, is pretty spotty. It's mostly young kids that don't know much and get paid less than they know. There are some exceptions though. There is one guy in the Electronics department (big guy, wears glasses...supervisor I think) who is extremely knowledgeable. This guy really knows his stuff. The people on the returns desk are all very nice.  One of the things I like most about Fry's is their very liberal return policies. It's easy and hassle free to return just about anything. Give it a try - it's heaven on earth for geeks :-)

I met a buddy here for dinner last night. Here is the lowdown:  Location: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5  Don't miss the cornbread, it's fantastic. We started out by splitting a bowl of chips and salsa. The salsa is fresh and very good. The chips were crunchy and not too salty. I had the green chili enchilada with black beans. Not normally a big black bean fan I was surprised how good these can taste when they are very fresh and well prepared. The rice was nice and fluffy and delicious. The waiter was cheerful and helpful with suggestions. The service was very prompt without hovering over us - not an easy balance to strike.   A nice bonus is that they will valet your car for free. Just get your ticket validated by your server. The location is right off Mill Ave. so you are right in the heart of the action. The prices are very reasonable as well. Most of the entrees are $10-15. This place is great, give it a try.

I've been to this place many times but I'm finally getting around to write a review. First of all it's in a great location, right on Mill Ave. You go up a flight of stairs and you'll be greeted  and seated usually fairly quickly. If it's not too hot or too cold you might want to try the outdoor patio. The view is nice and it's a bit quieter than the inside. As far as the food goes, it's not 5 star gourmet fair but they make an excellent burger and the garlic fries are out of this world. The beer selection is quite good and the service was prompt and cheerful. I've never had a bad meal or bad service here. Give it a try for yourself and see what you think.

US Airways is like two different airlines. If you're an elite member you get good US Airways, otherwise you get bad US Airways. I travel a lot for work....not exactly a badge of honor but, whatever...and I have to say that when you reach that level a whole new world of service opens up to you. One of the things they do that I like is the policy of automatic upgrades, based on availability. Other airlines want you to fiddle around with coupons and such. These guys just give you a seat. Simple and efficient...works for me :-)  To me airlines are sort of like cell phone providers. They all suck, some just suck a little less than others. With the hub-and-spoke system the airlines have created more or less a monopoly. If you live in Phoenix the only viable options are US Air and Southwest. Sure, there are other airlines but you'll be faced with connections and poor schedules so pick your poison.   ALL airlines experience delays and they ALL lie about the reason for the delay. When they say it's a 15 minute delay it really means an hour. They intentionally oversell flights in the hope that someone will cancel. Unlike the hotel elite programs, your miles WILL expire if you're not careful and don't expect to get a courtesy note either.   Why the rant? It's only to illustrate that all airlines are the same. US Airways is no better or no worse than any of the others.   I will say this for them though, their frequent flyer perks are fairly good and relatively easy to reach. Once you get to Gold or Platinum the upgrades are pretty regular. Just being able to use the first class check-in line at the airport is nice, even if you don't get a first class seat that day.   So yeah, it's not perfect but it's better than some. And that's about as close and I'm going to get to a compliment for any airline :-)

Yeah, Alexander is right...they do leave you alone. That's the good part. The bad part comes when you actually want some advice. For the most part they are clueless. What really gets me is how hard they push the extended warranties. I know that it's a big revenue stream for them but it really boarders on criminal how they take advantage of people. Oh well, buyer beware I suppose :-)

If you are determined to eat healthy this is the place to get your groceries. Their fruits and vegetables are always really good. For such a small store (maybe about 1/4 the size of a Fry's) Sprouts has a tremendous variety of items. There is a very good selection of organic products and supplements. Like most grocery stores, some items are priced very well and others not so well.   The staff seems to be helpful and upbeat. There is a decidedly upscale feel to this store. I can't quite put my finger on why but it just seems to attract a different type of customer.   Getting in and out of the parking lot can be a bit of an adventure, especially on weekends. If there is such a thing as a "fun" place to shop for groceries, this is it.

Yes, the coupons convinced me to give it a try too :-) The brakes were squeaking and I knew I needed new pads so I decided to give them a try. The service was prompt, courteous and they didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. Once they had the car up on the hoist they took me in and showed me the obviously worn pads and got my approval before fixing anything.   I opted for the Ceramic pads and I would highly recommend them. No brake dust, no squeaking, longer wear and not much more than the Asbestos pads that come with most cars.   I take my car there for all my routine maintenance. Good service, honest and a fair price.

This B&N is fairly new - less than 5 years I think. The staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Like most B&N's they allow and encourage browsing of magazines and books alike. If they don't have the book you are looking for just ask someone and they will find it. Great place to hang out while my wife is shopping...lol.

This place has been popular ever since it opened. We were sorely lacking a decent non-fast food restaurant in this part of the city and Macayo's fits the bill. The salsa, as another reviewer mentioned, is really really good. I usually go with the Chimichanga and it never disappoints. The decor is very colorful and lively. I would say it's a good value for the money. If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night you should make reservations. It can be a long wait otherwise.

I have heard Surprise Stadium described as one of the top spring training facilities in the country and I would have to agree with that. The grass field is gorgeous and always in great shape. The seats are great, whether you are behind home place or in the outfield. There are no bad seats in this stadium. The concessions are reasonably priced. The free parking is a nice bonus. You'll see lots of kids and families here.   The drawback is that there are no bars or restaurants right beside the stadium like some of the other spring training facilities have.  But if you exit the stadium and go north to Bell Rd. you'll find a lot of places to eat and drink.  The area around the stadium is slowly getting built up. Across the street is a nice Library and beyond that is a stocked lake and bbq area. There are basketball courts, a sand volleyball pit and even a fenced in dog park. The new tennis facility is outstanding. There are now two hotels - the new Marriott just opened or is about to open. Part of the problem is that the stadium is surrounded by so much land that it still looks a bit empty. Yes, it's a bit of a hike to get here for many people but it's worth the trip.

Lucky's is great. The ingredients are fresh and it's always a good pie. You can't beat their lunch special. It's a nice alternative to the big chain pizza places. Try their lasagna too, it's really good.

5 stars? For a sub shop? Yup, absolutely! Subway feels like an  assembly line compared to this place. Fresh rolls, all the cold cuts are prepared and sliced as you wait. Even the olives were really good, and I'm a bit of an olive snob.   I had the footlong tuna on whole wheat. The tuna was really fresh and it was a generous helping as well. Great pepper jack cheese that had a nice kick to it. I got it to go but I took a quick look around the inside and it looked clean and inviting. They had a TV mounted on the wall that had some sports playing. It had kind of a family diner feel to it.   On Sundays, any footlong cold sub is only $3.95. $3.95!!! I've paid that for a greasy pizza slice. For the same amount here you can get a delicious, fresh and healthy meal.   I can see this place being on the regular Sunday lunch rotation. Besides, it's a local business so why not support them? Give it a shot...highly recommended!

Trent was right on time. Unfortunately the dent was beyond when he was able to fix but I appreciate that he was upfront about it. He took the time to look at and to give me an honest assessment at no charge. I was left with the impression that he was a cool guy and trustworthy. I'd recommend him.
