Good food, horrible service.  Our waiter disappeared on us multiple times, food was brought out randomly (two plates, then 10 minutes later 5 plates, then lastly my 2 year olds food 10 minutes after that - after we had to ask somebody else to check on it).  Our waiter never asked us for drink refills, didn't bring my daughters drink out until we were halfway done with dinner.  When we asked for the check it took almost 30 minutes to bring it out.  We were planning on hosting our grandfather's 80th birthday party here in August, but have since decided to look at other places to do so.

When we first moved to Goodyear over a year ago my SO was worried he wouldn't be able to find a good barber shop - but we hit the jackpot with Kim's.  She's done his hair almost every time, and is amazing.  My SO is a Marine vet and loves his high-and-tights and Kim does it right every time.  We come back monthly and will until we no longer live in the area.

While the office staff is less than to be desired at times, Dr. De Salvo is a great find as is his nurse Debbi.  I was early to my appointment the other day - and was in and out before my actual appointment time, and didn't feel rushed.  Being 35 weeks pregnant and with 2 little ones waiting on me at home with their dad, that was a treat as I dislike the appointments towards the end of pregnancy as it is :)  My favorite part of this office is the in-office ultrasound technicians.  Unlike my previous OB/GYN, I don't have to schedule appointments with a separate ultrasound technician out of office.

Seriously disappointed in this place.  After finally getting a BBQ joint on the West Side, I was excited to try Rudy's... and then we got it today at work for lunch and it was extremely blase.  Nothing to write to mom about, everything was boring.  And the "Texas toast" we were told about by the girl at the front counter - was a loaf of white bread.  Seriously?!    Maybe eating in would yield a better experience, but right now I'm not impressed and highly doubtful.

Stopped by on my way to work to get something to eat for dinner on Cinco de Mayo.  I was extremely disappointed.  My food was cold when I got it - the cheese wasn't even melted in my cheese enchiladas.  I had to microwave it for a minute to get it nice and melty.  The beans were good, but only after reheated and the rice was weird.  It had really large chunks of carrots in it, something I've never experienced in all my Mexican food eating.  Not sure I will be eating here in the future.
