After calling 8 companies for estimates, Harris & Sons was by far the lowest. I didn't want to go with just the least expensive either, so I did my research first. I only called companies with excellent BBB ratings which would also ensure that they were licensed and insured too!   I wanted estimates on the removal and stump grinding of a 60+ ft pine tree, 50 inches in diameter whose roots had cracked the corner of our perimeter wall. It was also leaning over our neighbor's house. You wouldn't believe the difference in pricing!! I actually got an estimate for twice the amount that Harris & Sons offered. What I liked about them was that they didn't start off with a high price and then try to negotiate it down to get my business, they were low from the start!   I spoke to Jerry, who was very pleasant over the phone.  A few months later, (my research took some time)  I called them to schedule the service. I didn't even need to be there. Yeah.. it made me  little nervous, but these guys are professionals. They came out October 18th, 2013 in the morning while I was at work. NOT ONLY did they do an EXCELLENT job removing our tree, but they even cleaned up the area and took branches lying around that my husband had cut off another tree.   I'm so HAPPY with their service. I would definitely recommend them and use them in the future.

We came here on a double date and both parties where blown away by the flavor of their entrees. This visit was on a Friday night, and we all know going out to dinner on a Friday is gonna be a wait. This place is really popular, so if you don't want to wait go before the dinner rush.   The food and service once we got sat were well worth the wait. This is why we've continued to come back. We always seem to get sat in Clarissa's area. She is so upbeat and genuinely happy to see us. Whenever we have questions she provides with more than enough information to help us make our choice. She's even brought us samples of the sauces used in dishes to see if we'll like them. This is AMAZING customer service.   Here's what we've had that I HIGHLY recommend: 902 (yes, I know it's fried rice, but the flavor is unlike any other typical fried rice I've had) 403,400,306,854.    The only I haven't been too crazy about is the golden curry puffs. I felt they were bland. One out of the many we've had isn't bad.   Can't wait to try more dishes!

Kale Caesar salad had great flavor but here's why I give It two stars:  My coworker and I went on our hour lunch. We were greeted by a girl making smoothies at the counter who indicated she'd be right with us. She asked us where we'd like to sit, grabbing a couple menus for us and the girls behind us. My coworker told her the bar area and she said wherever we wanted to sit was fine. She gestured for us to head in that direction when my coworker changed her mind and stopped at a open table wanting to sit there.  I asked the hostess if it was "ok" to sit there. Annoyed, she answered yes so we sat down. She sat the ladies behind us giving them menus but not us. My coworker waited a bit to see if she would bring some to us. Since no one did, she got up, went to the front and got two for us.   Maura C.; our friendly and polite server, greeted us and took our orders. She brought our food, but mine was incorrect. She was taking care of another table so I stopped the manager (a very polite blonde lady) who was walking by to let her know. She apologized and said she'd bring out another. While I waited I ate the chicken off the salad I was given. It was flavorful but VERY DRY. At this time I look at my phone. I'm getting nervous. By the time I get my salad I'm not going to have much time to eat it before we have to go. Our server dropped by apologizing and asked if I'd like the salad to go. Thanking her I said, "Yes". The manager comes out with a plated salad. I let her know that I had asked for it to go, so she boxes it quickly but now we have to leave.   We sit there waiting for the check. After a while I figure we're supposed to pay at the front. We go up to the front and I tell the manager we need to go or were going to be late. She grabs Maura who rings us up. Wow, they didn't even offer to discount my meal. I'm annoyed I'm paying $12 for a salad I had to wait 45 minutes for, but there's no time to argue, we have to go.   Picazzo's: There's no excuse that a item that requires NO cooking should take this long. It was a big inconvenience to have to eat at my desk while working instead of enjoying it on my lunch break like I should've. If I could get my money back, I would.

I'm updating my review to indicate that General Manager; Natalie, Hecht, responded to my feedback. I'm giving Picazzo's 4 stars because of their response. Recognizing customer concerns/complaints are a sign of great customer service. I will be going back. Thank you Natalie!

I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Now that have, I'm good.   It's the kind of place you go to after a night of partying when your standards aren't so high. It wasn't all THAT bad, but not great  either.    I judge Latin-style restaurants on their chips and salsa. If it's not good, I know what to expect from their kitchen. With that said.. the chips were greasy and salsa tasted like Pace picante.   I had the two taco plate of grilled chicken and steak tacos with re-fried beans and rice. The grilled steak taco had good flavor, but the chicken was VERY dry. I added lime and salsa to try and moisten it up. All and all...it was decent, but not any better quality than a late night taco place.   Service was ok.

I'd been going to a salon in Tucson for 20+ years, but after moving to Tempe I had to find a new go-to place for waxing, so I looked to Yelp to find one. I came across excellent reviews for Glow and decided to go with them.   When booking my first appointment, the receptionist had such a friendly voice and was very accommodating.   My appointment was with Rachel. She's super sweet, funny, and did a very thorough job. She took the time to explain what she was doing...even stopping at times to check my comfort level. Afterwards, she sent me home with a sample of cream to calm the waxed area. No one there was pushy about selling product either!  As I was checking out, I was given a welcome gift with sample goodies for being a new client.   I'm so happy with how personable the staff was and the service I received that I left booking my next appointment.

I called and left a message on 7/2/15 at 8:26 AM to get a quote. I have yet to hear from them.   Maybe he's  on an extended holiday vacation. I'd be willing to update my review when he calls back.

While I ended up with pretty toenails, the experience wasn't the greatest. I had a morning appointment yesterday for a classic pedi. I read many Yelp reviews about Mary, so I was excited to get her. Although she was friendly, she was a little aggressive in the cleaning my toe nails. Afterwards, she sprayed something on them; not cuticle oil, and one of my toes stung, which meant she cut me at some point during the cleaning. I was surprised that the callous smoothing portion of it was over so quickly. My heels were still rough right after the appointment. After she finished painting my nails she started to prep for her next client. She never came back. I'm used to them coming back to help put your sandals on, but maybe they don't do that here.   All and all, I might use this as a back-up provided that I see someone else, but I think I'll keep looking for a pedi place.

After posting my review the owner promptly apologized and offered a complimentary pedicure. It took me by surprise. I wasn't expecting to hear from the owner. To me, this is a sign of a great business. The owner truly cares about the customer experience.   Well, I decided to try it out again, this time going with his suggestion of seeing Kai. WOW! What a difference! She was FANTASTIC!! She paid great attention to detail, was incredibly thorough, and VERY gentle. I really liked her.   Thank you. I will definitely be back!

The price is a great, but I was disappointed that it wasn't homemade ice cream. The girl behind the counter said one of the ones they use is Blue Bell.   Still, I got a strawberry milkshake. It was incredibly bland. Other than knowing I picked out strawberry, there was nothing else to indicate it's flavor.   Now, they have a selection of cookies you can choose from to make ice cream sandwiches that they indicate are made from scratch, but they didn't look all that appealing to me.   Sorry, but there's nothing that would bring me back.

Such a cozy and cute coffeehouse! For my first time here some regulars behind me suggested a Dirty Chai, half sweet/half spicy. AMAZING! I've had chai tea lattes at many coffeehouses but never a spicy one. The heat is just the right amount. It comes up unexpectedly too. I think it's cayenne, among other spices.   GREAT SERVICE. Michelle is so friendly and chatty. I'm so happy with my experience. I can't wait to be back. I wish it were closer to me!!

After having finished dinner nearby we headed to Rita's to satisfy a sweet fix. We were expecting to just get custard, but they have a variety of Italian ice making our selection harder.   They offer you samples, so we tasted marshmallow peanut butter, pi√±a colada, mint chocolate chip, and strawberry. Strawberry was by far the BEST!    We went with a gelati. It's Italian ice with custard on The bottom and top. OMG! The vanilla custard was so creamy. It paired well with the texture of the Italian ice. Let the ice melt a little and you have PERFECTION. I will definitely come back.

I was embarrassed to bring my out of town guest here last night for dinner, especially after going on and on about how delicious this place was.   Service was GREAT but something was really off last night; perhaps it was the cook that night.   Me: Chicken panini with Salut fries. Too much oil was used in grilling it, because it came out greasy, leaving an oily residue on my fingers. Fries were good, but I liked the way they used to serve it with the crumbled feta not shaved/dry feta.   Guest: Malbec burger with regular fries. Ground meat used for burger had chewy nerve endings and her fries were too salty to eat.   I'm just disappointed. Our meals certainly weren't worth what we spent on them. After this experience, I don't think I'll be back. Maybe this is a sign of things to come for this restaurant.

We recently moved into our first home a couple months ago and couldn't be happier! I must say it was frustrating at times due to the lack of inventory and aggressive housing market, but with Tanya Shield's persistence, great customer service and wonderful personality, we finally purchased our home in a great Tempe neighborhood.   I cannot say enough good things about this company. I really felt as though we were our agent's only customer. She was extremely flexible with her time and even called me at 10pm to answer questions I had!   I recommend using this company when looking for your dream home!   Thank you Velasco Group!

My first impression was very disappointing. Ok, to give them the benefit of the doubt, their register crashed causing their disorganization. There wasn't a lot of people though and the four of us only ordered juices/smoothies. How hard is that?! I also ordered one of their chocolate balls from their bakery.  They forgot it, so I had to go back up to the register to ask about it. The guy was apologetic and said he's bring it right over, which he did.  Everyone got their smoothies and juices but me. I remained patiently waiting until my friends finished their drinks. I realized they forgot me again. I went back to the register and notified the girl there that I never got my cucumber cooler. She apologized, they made it right then and there and gave it to me.  I was a little annoyed at all this.. So much that my review so far is solely based on customer service.  While waiting I did have a sip of the Good Juju and berry smoothie. They were both delicious. This is the reason I might come back, but if the service is the same I certainly won't.
