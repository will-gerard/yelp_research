I love their pancakes. Phenomenal. Their ice cream sandwiches are also amazing.

Super friendly and knowledgable. We haven't had to do a sick visit, but well checks are great. The doctor takes time to listen and answer questions, which is great since we're first-time parents and have a million questions every visit!

The food is so-so, but the service was awful. The employees were incredibly difficult to hear and it was the most inefficient line service I've ever seen. 11:45 on a Thursday, during lunch rush, only two of six employees were really doing anything. Stood in line for 30 minutes, maybe 10 other customers were in front of me. A line of similar length at Chipotle would have taken 10 minutes, tops.

My favorite pizza in the Valley. Locally owned and great food. Their pizza, wings, and salad are all great. Very reasonable lunch specials, too.

Good food and service. We really enjoy this place and it's right across the street from our house. Haven't found something I didn't like there!

Went twice for lunch because we had a Groupon. Terrible both times. Just not worth it.

I've gone here several times and love it. I also like that it's locally owned. The salsa is great, and they give you chips if you dine-in. I get the three taco combination and have gotten a variety of kinds of tacos, all were great - especially like the shrimp taco!

My one-year old daughter has been going here since she turned 4 months old, when I went back to work. The staff made it easy and painless for me to go back to work, knowing my daughter was in capable hands. She LOVES going to school and adores her teachers. Even at her age, she LEARNS at Little Sunshine's. Every activity in the infant room has a purpose - even footprint or handprint artwork has a skill associated with it (for example, handprint art develops the skill of "holding hand firmly to a hard surface for several seconds").
