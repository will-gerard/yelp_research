After a riding lesson in Rio Verde we went in for a burger.  Had a green chili burger and it was excellent!  Looking forward to a return trip with my wife and friends Ashley and Barak!  Love the "West" atmosphere, open pit fires, warm greeting!

Margaritas are the best anywhere!    Love the staff, love the service!  This is the first place we take out of town guests and they immediately feel right at home.  Always our #1 choice!

Excellent lunch!!!!!! Great value! Great wine! Great atmosphere!  The only negative, I don't care for valet parking.

EXCELLENT food and service.  We had the sampler platter and also tried the stuffed Potato Skins.  The meat was tender and moist (Perfect)!   Service was exceptional!  We'll be back!

My wife and I visited last night and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised!  I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy and just had them make recommendations for our entree.  Both our meals were FANTASTIK!  The appetizers were authentic and excellent as well!  Service here was way above average.  Z and Ed both were throughout the restaurant visiting with guests and exchanging pleasantries.  Overall feeling is very nice.  Well laid out, nice lighting, perfect for an evening for 2 but we plan to go back soon with several friends so they can enjoy the atmosphere as well.  Prices were very fair especially for the portion sizes.  I found their complete menu on Facebook.  Definately on our list of favorite restaurants!

Came home Wednesday afternoon to several thousand uninvited guests that had taken up residence outside my front door.  Called David with ASAP Bee Removal and scheduled an appointment for Thursday morning.  Showed up ON TIME and did a great job!  Courteous, informative at a reasonable price.  I would highly recommend their service.  Milan Eaton Desert Hills, Az.

I've been using the Happy Valley site for YEARS.  It was a Dannys forever and since it's been converted to Jacksons I can't seem to get a decent wash.  I took my F250 in (It's a tough one) and the vacuum job was absolutely pathetic.  While in the drying line they decided that it need to go through the was again and it still came out dirty (It wasn't that dirty to begin with, just big). I decided to give them another shot with my Altima (Simple right?)  it sat in the vacuum line for 10 minutes with the doors open before anyone even touched it.  Vacuum job was OK this time (Still not as expected).  Wash was just OK and the finish was terrible.  I purchased the "VIP" so I expected a decent job.  The car still had dirty spots on it and the rear passenger window (Where my grandson sits) still had fingerprints on the inside of the glass.  Service is VERY slow now and quality of work is very bad.  Sorry to say that I will not be going back.
