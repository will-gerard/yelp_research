Mozaik is easily one of my favorite places to go for my skincare! After each facial I have had with Johnna I noticed an instant difference in my skin, so much healthier and glowing! Very knowledgable about aesthetics and am so glad I found her! She also creates such a soothing environment, very relaxing and peaceful - really important to me.  The staff is super sweet and welcoming. Always able to answer any questions. Definitely worth checking them out!!!

I usually have nothing bad to say about this place since the treatments are always so great, but my last visit set me over the edge with their management.   Very poorly run business.   I called to schedule an appointment for my daughter and I for her Birthday. We came in at our expected time to find that the guy at the front desk wrote us down for another day. I would have understood that mistakes happen, but it was the fact that he made it seem like it was my fault we were written down for another day. All he needed to do was own up to the mistake made and we would be on our way.   What ever happened to "the customer is always right?" Not at this place. I would suggest getting someone new up at the front desk ASAP. I would hate for others to have the same experience.
