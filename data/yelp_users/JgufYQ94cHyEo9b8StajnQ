Dr. Lykins was great...but the office staff was horrible!    He saw my two kids (2 and 4) to have tubes removed.  Not sure why I had to come back for the second appointment, but I think it was a $$ thing...anyway, suppose to have surgery in two days and I canceled both!   The office insisted that I had to pay before the surgery (to the tune of $35)...but they hadn't billed for the kids last appointment.  If they had we would be at our deductible and owe NOTHING!  The lady argued with me about it...I was so upset, I have another appointment for the kids on Monday with another ENT to have their tubes out...what a circus!

Service:  For a lunch hour it was the place to be!  However, we split to items on the menu and it took for EVER!  We ordered a salad to split and a hamburger.  We sat for a good 15 minutes between finishing our salad and the delivery of our hamburger.  And it was a bit frustrating when then table that sat down next to us was brought their meal way before ours came out! Quality of Food: My grandmother and I got the house salad to split and a hamburger.  The salad was brought out on separate plates; a bit smaller than I had thought...and definitely glad that I didn't get it just for lunch.  The hamburger was small!  Not cooked to our liking.  While they did take it back and "re-cook" the burger it seemed dry when it was brought out again.   Service: it was OK.  When we brought our problem to the manager's attention she blamed the kitchen and how their ordering system worked.  I really didn't buy it as I had worked in restaurants before.  To her credit, she did take care of the meal. Cleanliness: The restaurant seemed clean; it was the restrooms that were in need of attention!

I wish this was a half star... I had a gift card for a detail so I HAD to go here.  Told the guy, no shiny stuff on the dash and don't forget to tell them about the third row...well that didn't happen.  I left my car there for 5 hours only to have to wait an additional 45 minutes to have the car finished - I found all that they forgot.    Come on people!  I am paying money to have a car detailed!  Do your job!  Don't make me wait when I am there to pick up my car after having it for that long!    The kicker was that they "gave" me a free wash for my time...no thank you!  WILL NOT GO BACK!

Such a fun place to give your house that "look!"  Your friends will be asking "where did you get that!?!?"  The small import business Daniel and Dominique Boone began in their garage in June of 1992 has grown into one of the country's largest warehouses of polished metalware projects direct to the public. Frames, candlesticks, serving trays, bowls, wine buckets, mirrors, and crosses, are only some of the hundreds of items that fill the warehouse. Named after their daughter, Holland, Holland Boone Home is not just known for metalware anymore. The thirteen thousand square foot show room also houses gorgeous one-of-a-kind furniture, Italian pottery, wall hangings and clocks, Mexican glass, seasonal decorations, and much, much more. Add style and color to any room in your house. With new shipments arriving weekly, there are always interesting new pieces to discover at Holland Boone Home.

Love, Love, Love this place!  I can't think of sending my children anywhere else!  I know my kids are in good hands when I drop them off, and I know they had a good time when they talk about going to "school."  Cher (the head person) has been there forever and loves all the children.  I can't say enough good things about this place!  Please ask if you have something specific.

The Wigwam gave me and my husband exactly what we were looking for in a stay-cation.  We arrived and were greeted by the bellmen; guided to where to check in.  The front office was pleasant.    Off to our room - a bit dated, but there are plans to update within the next year.  The property was breath taking.  Even though we are in a desert, you would never know with all the green everywhere.  We woke and ran around the property...stopping at the Farmer's Market...had no idea that there were so many local farmers :)  After breakfast, off to the spa to relax by the pool and for treatment...just awesome.  We came back relaxed and ready to start our week.

If you're searching for THE best coal-fired brick oven, New York-style thin crust pizza in the world, look no further. Grimaldi's offers over 100 years of pizza-making traditions and the tantalizing aroma of pizza and calzones baked to perfection in the signature coal burning oven. Why coal-fired ovens? It gives our pizza and calzones a unique flavor and a crisp crust that is just not possible from gas, convection or wood burning ovens.

Love, Love Dr. Z!  She is great!  Interested in taking care of the patient and is good in answering questions.  Other Dr's are good, but you have to experience each for yourself to see who will work best for you and your child.  Ask tons of questions, and get answers!  Also, the website is helpful in answering many of the questions I have :)

I needed a bunkie board (like a box spring, but only 2 inches high) for our bed - just doesn't have much support without something between the mattress and the slats.  Anyway, looked online and everything was going to be a wait and pretty expensive.  I called Mattress Firma and Charlie helped me order the item over the phone AND was able to get it delivered TONIGHT!  So excited to have some support under my mattress!

I really don't have complaints about this place!  They do a good job - consistently!  If there is a problem, I ask them to re-do the item and they do.  Great customer service.

Yep, that's right...they are sending me to collections for a bill that I haven't paid! WHY haven't I paid it? Well, that is because the PA did $1,000 worth of blood tests...and spent the ENTIRE visit selling me on the weight loss plan that they sell out of the office! NOT only that, they went as far as to do an ultra sound and I STILL don't have results! Why would you EVER pay for something that you didn't get the product of service for?!?! These people are on something...I quickly found out that they were full of it - thank God - and went to another doctor whose practice is amazing! Please don't waste your time finding out your thyroid problem here...they will only sell you on weight loss product :( Oh, and they won't call me back!

The day just flew by...I had no idea that relaxing was so much fun!  - workout facility...better than your average resort! - hot/cold plung pools - water - I know this sounds weird, but in AZ you need water!  They change the flavors to match the time of day! - music - during your treatments they let you pic the music! - mineral pool - hand picked from Europe, the minerals will soften your skin. - AZ residencial rate - call and ask, its worth it! - food service - this is the ONLY complaint I have...too SLOW...I ordered food twice and never ate a bite; I never had enough time before the appointments.

Normally, I go into detail about a restaurant...but why bother when you know its going to be the same goodness everytime you go!  Great wine list for sure!  Steaks always come out piping hot with the butter jumping off the plate.  Cut into the steak and soak up every last bit of that butter!  It will be a party in your mouth.  Desert...you can't leave without!  Even just to take it home (if you are too full) is worth it.    You won't be disappointed in this place...guaranteed!

My husband and his brother had been to Cork and absolutely loved it, so naturally for my brother-in-law's birthday, we took him there!  Ambience: relaxed, sophisticated, modern  Menu: definitely not traditional...they had a lot of items that you don't see at every restaurant.  We had the "spontaneous chef's menu."  Each person at the table has to order it if you are getting it.  You get 5 courses each...and each person gets something different.  We would all try ours' and pass our plates...we ended up trying 20 different foods that night!  My favorite was a tie between the Elk and the Kobe Beef tenderloin...both were amazing!  Restrooms: Stylish and clean!  Wine:  They had a great wine selection along with a full bar.

There is no other gym I would rather go!  I have belonged to many other places and this is the ONLY place I keep going back to.    It is a bit on the pricy side, but if it gets me there and makes me want to work out, I am for it!    Classes - instructors are great!   Facility - clean and welcoming.

We dined at Meritage and thought it was OK.    We purchased the coupon on Travel Zoo; a predetermined chef's menu was presented with the wine list as we sat down.  Menu - all meats were available with potatoes and asparagus; nothing exciting about the sides: potatoes were too smooth and the asparagus was over cooked.  It was nice that they gave us the option to upgrade our meats; but the prices were a bit high.  Wine was reasonably priced.  Bread was better than described in a previous review...actually we thought it was the best part of the dinner.  Salad and soup: I had the Meritage salad which was ok, nothing too exciting and husband had the french onion soup which was good but had too much bread and cheese on top.  I had the salmon - over cooked and didn't have the same garnish that was in the description of the menu...husband had the prime rib and said it was OK.  Desert: we had the seven layer cake...and it didn't taste fresh...like it had been sitting out for a while.  We split a piece and took the other home.  Overall...we spent too much for dinner that should have been great!  I wouldn't waste your time or money especially if you have a favorite steak house that is better than OK.

Ok...the chair for my pedicure didn't slide back enough ...I have long legs and my knees were in my chest. A typical pedi is about 45 minutes...not here...she was almost done 20 minutes in. Just a disappointment when I look forward to the 45 minutes. The place was clean and plesant...just wanted more!  Great if you don't have a lot of time...but not if you want to relax.

I went in with my friend and was a bit hesitant because I didn't know what to expect...we were greeted and offered water (it was a bit funny though, when my girlfriend made the appointment she spelled out her name, and when we got there they still had it wrong).  So they took her back and I waited a couple of minutes for my stylist.  OK - I had a good experience...but the overall tone of this place is just not good!  All the responses from our reviews have been negative.  However, my friend had the exact opposite expereince.  She wasn't offered wine and her stylist didn't flat iron her hair in small pieces like she had asked.    Of course I felt bad because this was my friend's idea and I went along and had a great time...wish there was a way to make it a great experience for all!  PS - I revised my review and the owner had it removed.  This place is LIMP and FLAT!  Please don't waste your money here...go where you are appreciated!  I gave the a ONE star b/c the owner's attitude toward my friend was RUDE!  I can't believe in the economy that people would even take that approach.

If you are looking to see a movie and have a night out...go to iPic!  My favorite place to see a movie!  Pay for the more expensive ticket at it includes valet parking and popcorn - you add that to the price of the lower ticket, and you have the same price in tickets.  A truly FANTASTIC movie experience!!!
