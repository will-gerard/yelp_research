Moving from metro to rural has its advantages, but it also creates some new, interesting experiences. One of them, was finding a propane company. If you've never bought propane, let alone decide on a tank for your home, where do you start?  Hitting Google, I soon learned there are quite a few propane companies. I also learned each one seems to have their own prices (many, ridiculous) - especially when purchasing a tank.  About five calls/emails into the process, I called Acorn and Mike answered the phone.  He was very knowledgeable and patient; answering all my questions and making me feel like they'd take care of the product they were experts in, and not screw me over.  I purchased a tank and they delivered and conducted a safety survey. Seven years later, there isn't anyone I'd rather do business with than Acorn. In fact, even when I forget to check the tank and realize there's only about 20% left on Friday, they happily show up on Monday to keep things going.  This is a class act local company with great customer service.

We've eaten here many times. The turkey bialy is one of my favorites.  Most of the time the service is excellent.  Today we had a few issues with the preparation of the food, but when brought to the attention of the manager, he took the appropriate steps to make everything great.   This is a good, solid restaurant where you know that the quality of the food will be good.

The owners of DHM are fabulous! Donna & Dori provide great customer service. They'll accept all packages from every carrier, including those that need signatures. Whether you have a business or a personal mailbox, they make the process easy. In addition, they raise a lot of money and donations for those in need in the community.

This store carries some of the most unique southwest items in the area. If they don't have it - they'll get it for you.  On top of that, the prices are incredibly reasonable.  If you're in doubt - price an item at Buffalo Bill's and then drive 300 yards up Cave Creek and price the same item.  Guaranteed it will cost 10x more elsewhere.  The owners are incredibly friendly and helpful.  They've even delivered larger furniture items to the house at no additional cost.  I don't shop anywhere else.

I've taken 3 cars to Chuck at Tobias and each time, he's exceeded expectations. Customer service is fantastic. On a Mercedes convertible repair, his quote was less than half of what Shumacher wanted for a very intricate hydraulic repair. On an older Acura, he continued to work on the vehicle until the air conditioning was blowing colder than it did originally. I'm now a loyal customer and call Chuck before anyone else.

I try to check in here at least once a week. They're constantly getting new treasures.  Purchased a custom leather sofa. Got it home - tried it out for a few weeks, and decided that the pattern on the back didn't really work because of the open area of the decor. Inquired with the owner who allowed me to return it and swap it for a brand new one with a different design. Who does that these days? On several occasions, I've found items that would cost a ridiculous amount of money new or even in a Scottsdale 'shoppe' and were ver reasonably priced. In fact, there's room for negotiation on almost everything. I highly recommend you check them out if you're looking for something different.

A good example of how Yelp can save you from potential disaster. I had a refrigerator issue, and called my home warranty company, Old Republic, to request service. They emailed back that Protech would be the contractor working on my issue. I went to Yelp, read the reviews, and immediately contacted ORHP to voice concern. They said they understood and were re-assigning me to someone else, because Protech said they couldn't come look at my refrigerator for 4 days. WHAT?  I'm not sure how this company stays in business if that's their response time? Maybe I should get a horse and wagon and start an ice block business to take advantage of the scheduling.

I had purchased a pair of glasses from this company in 2009. They were excellent: high quality - great customer service and extremely knowledgeable. A few days ago, the temple piece broke away from the lens. It couldn't have come at a worse time because I had a flight to the east coast 3 days later. I called and the owner, Mehr Khavari told me to come in. He did a 'rush' order and had my new lens' back within 72 hours. I should mention that my prescription is not capable of being filled with "stock" lens. He certainly did not have to jump through these hoops to make this happen. The tremendous customer service, follow up, and personal attention has earned a loyal customer. I would recommend them to anyone.

We have eaten at this restaurant since it opened and it's always a great experience.  Most of the Teppan chefs have great personality and do an entertaining job of preparing the food.  The owners, Barry and Ahn, are very friendly and constantly walk the floor interacting with customers and checking to make sure everything is good.  They remember regular customers and are always happy to welcome you back.  The Happy Hour menu is very good with a variety of choices.  The sushi is always fresh and well prepared.  I noticed in a previous post that someone commented that the restaurant is loud.  Being as there are several Teppan tables, it can get loud - but in a fun and appropriate way.  They also have a huge patio and if you've never witnessed an Arizona sunset from there, you're missing out.  As I mentioned, we've been coming to this restaurant since it opened - sometimes a couple of times a week. We will continue to do so.

I wish I had the same experience as the other reviewers.  Based on the reviews here and the website, I called iMobile Repair several times.  No call back.  I emailed them.  No email back.  Their website claims to accept phone calls 24/7 and provide service M-Su 9a-9p.  Not true.  When my iPhone smashed, I needed service immediately; not in a day - not in two days - and not in three days at the time of writing this review.  I would not recommend this company if you use your equipment for business or need immediate attention.

Unfortunately, I did not have the same service from this business. When I dropped my iPhone, I needed a quick fix.   Based on the reviews here and the website, I called iMobile Repair several times.  No call back.  I emailed them.  No email back.  Their website claims to accept phone calls 24/7 and provide service M-Su 9a-9p.  Not true.

This UPS store is beyond ridiculous.  I sent a package on October 18th to my parents.  It arrived smashed into pieces.  I filed a claim two weeks later and the woman behind the counter said they would handle everything.  UPS insures all packages up to $100.  I've followed up on the phone three times and personally gone into the store three more.  The second to last time I went in - I waited for 20 minutes while the one worker tried to figure out what she was doing with another customer.  Then another girl appeared - went and rifled through some files and said, "Yep it's here, we're just waiting on UPS to get back to us.  Fast forward 4 more weeks I went in again and the girl behind the counter couldn't even find a record of the shipment.  Luckily, I saved the shipping receipt.  I find it hard to believe that a company as large as UPS should take 4 months to review a small claim.  The biggest part of this ordeal is this particular UPS store. They don't appear to have much knowledge beyond selling stamps.

I have an older Acura.  The R12 needed replaced in the air conditioning. John at Auto Tune said they carried R12 but it was really expensive.  He told me they had a similar product, Freeze12, that would work just as well at a fraction of the cost.  They also looked at some other issues on the vehicle.  I was impressed that they offered alternatives that were much less expensive.  I would not have known there was an option to R12, and they could have charged me a much higher price.  John was friendly and helpful and I will make the drive to take my vehicle there again.

Our water heater decided to quit, and it never happens at a convenient time. After finding a hybrid water heater at Lowes, you'd think the install would be a breeze. Not so. The subcontractor they use (BSJ Plumbing - see separate review) is unreliable when it comes to communication and quick scheduling. Even the employees at Lowes say they have problems sometimes. When I finally got ahold of the owner, he said he'd check on an install time and call me back. Well guess what? I'm still waiting for the callback. I drove to Lowes, loaded the water heater in my vehicle, got the extra parts and came home - now on day 5 with no hot water. I did a Yelp search for a plumber in my area, and Proskill was the first that came up with amazing reviews. It was a Saturday AM, so I wasn't confident it was going to be easy. I left a message and unfortunately, had to move on to the next call. That person said they could install. No sooner did I hang up, than Garrett from ProSkill called. I told him he was my first choice, but because it had been days with no hot water, I needed to find someone ASAP. He totally understood. Asked me some questions to make sure I had the right material and told me that if something should happen with the other company, to call him (even Saturday evening) and he'd see what he could do? So here's a guy who's not even going to be getting paid, making sure I have what I need with the right info, etc., and offering to come help anyway, if I need it. Subsequently, I've stored Proskill's number in my phone and it will be the first one I call when I need something in the future. TREMENDOUS customer service.

I needed some suggestions on improving the consistency of watering on my lawn. I also needed a few one-off jobs completed (cleaning river rock beds & removing a brush pile). I got the company's number from our neighbor, who uses this company. I called and left a message. Within an hour, the owner, James, called me back. He said he could come by the next day. He took a look at the various things I needed, and gave me some suggestions. He even gave me a bunch of sprinkler head replacements, without charging me and without knowing if I would ultimately hire him for the jobs. That night, I had quotes on the various projects. I hired the company to complete my projects and they're returning next week. Couldn't ask for better customer service and I'm able to spend my money in the community.

I've eaten at this restaurant probably 10 times, so I'm confident my overall assessment is accurate. The location is fabulous. The decor is amazing. The food is very good.  The issue with Venues? The service. Each time I go, it takes 40 minutes for food to arrive. Part of the wait is the 15-ish minutes it takes for a waitress to even come to the table. I'm not sure why this is because there are always plenty of employees walking around?  If the owners would fix the 'time/service' issues, this would be an overall fabulous restaurant.

There's not a whole lot to say except this store Rocks!  Tony, who helped us on Sunday afternoon, was incredibly knowledgable. He took the time to fit everyone with the proper helmet and inserts.  It was the equivalent of a custom fitting. He could have easily "upsold" , but didn't.  When it comes to helmets for quads, I will never go anywhere else.

During the recent hard freeze, our heating system didn't seem to be working properly. We called this company and they were slammed because of the weather.  They promised to come out - and they did.  It was in the evening and well past their normal hours, but the owner showed up and took care of the issue.  He had the house warming up in no time.  Excellent customer service.

In my nightmare of finding a reliable pool service, I got a call back from the owner, Steve. Unfortunately, his company doesn't service my area - but he spent a lot of time on the phone giving me some referrals and educating me on what to look for when choosing a company. Who knew that just because you have a net, bucket, and chlorine, that you're not necessarily a pool company?  This is a company that clearly has outstanding customer service.

I contacted MWP after our previous service went out of business. They've been in the area for a long time.  The owner came out and gave me an estimate for maintaining the pool.  Soon after, they wanted us to completely drain the pool and put in fresh water. Done at a $$ cost. They said that the new pool start-up would be at no cost - then charged an additional $125. Owner claimed driving, chemicals, etc. (The company is less than 2 miles from my house).  Each time after the employee would leave, the water would still be dirty, debris on the bottom, algae, etc. I called and emailed photos - the company responded "...it will be OK, don't worry." When I returned from a trip, the pool was filthy and the water smelled like a pond. The filter cartridges were so dirty there was not enough pressure to operate the spa jets or in-floor jets. When the employee came the next time, I watched what they did - spread shock - and used a leaf rake on the bottom of the pool. No brushing - no vacuuming, nothing. I told the company I wanted a refund of our money. No response. So, I called AMEX to chargeback the fees. There you have it. I'm sure I'll hear from them now.

Dear Bill Griffin: I have photos from each time your 'technicians' cleaned the pool. If you'd like, I can post them? You should also stick with the facts that concern you. I've used the same water hauling company for years - never with any issues - nor did I need to reverse any charges to them. They provided their service as promised. You should be glad I haven't filed a claim against your contractor's license for the cost of the 40,000 gallons of water that leaked into the desert because one of your 'technicians' TWICE pushed the auto-leveler to a position where it constantly ran - overflowing the trough on the negative edge. Or I could post the voicemail that you left me that was nothing short of being personally derogatory. Bottom line? Your company provides poor service and even worse customer service.

I called this company solely based on a Yelp review. I wanted to spend my money in the community. I had friends coming in from Hawaii, and needed a yard 'clean up'. I called and scheduled an estimate day. The owner, Jason, came to the house and couldn't have been nicer. Very pleasant. I told him I needed the back yard completely raked, the river rocks cleaned out and some of them re-set because the ¼- washes in during heavy rains. Depending upon the estimate, I said I'd also consider having the front yard raked and cleaned. He said he'd have Laura call me back with an estimate and options for scheduling. I thought that was kinda odd, given he's the owner and certainly knows how much he would charge to do something. Anyway, a half hour later, I got a VM from Laura saying they wouldn't be able to service my property because there wasn't enough work for the crew - and that the minimum charge would exceed the actual cost of the work. WHAT? I've had this done before and it wasn't a 'small' fee.  Quite honestly, I think the job was deemed somewhat a pain and the company didn't want to do it. Reading the company's statement of services at the bottom of their Yelp page, I can say it's not accurate.

You may have seen their commercial on TV: a bad guy using a crowbar, sledge hammer or baseball bat - bashing the window screen. It's just like on TV. These things are impenetrable. When the owner of the company showed up at the house, I was impressed. They make a product that is absolutely fabulous. It's by no means cheap, but there's no price for protecting your family. Production takes a little bit, so don't plan on a 2-week start to finish job. Each screen is custom made for your window. The installation crew was very professional and fun to watch. As a former LEO, I can't say enough about how well this product protects your home.

When the hot water heater went out, it's not something you can wait to 'get around to doing'. It pretty much needs attention, now. Headed to Home Depot and Lowes. Decided on the new hybrid hot water heater - because if there's anything I hate more, it's giving APS more money. The unit was sold by Lowes (GE/Rheem) and I figured using their installer would make it just as quick. WRONG. BSJ is a subcontractor for Lowes. You'd think that would mean they'd have exceptional customer service being as a major retailer is sending them business. Maybe they do, and maybe it was just a bad week for their President, but my experience was anything but good. First, they required an 'inspection visit' which costs $35. OK. Well, they couldn't do it until the next day. (Now day 3 of no hot water). Employee comes out at 6:30pm. Couldn't have been nicer. I was feeling pretty good about this. Said he'd call 'the boss' on the way home, give him the necessary info, and I should have an install estimate and appointment tomorrow. YEAH, HOT WATER AGAIN! Next day - no phone call - no message. Called my rep at Lowes. They hadn't heard anything. They called BSJ and Brad said he still didn't have it ready but would call in the afternoon. Waiting... waiting... no call. Called Lowes back at 3:30p reminding them that the BSJ tech had promised an install that day. They called BSJ back and was told they couldn't come out and that the platform my current tank was on had to be removed as well as the connection to the timer, before they could perform any work. WHAT? If I have to remove the platform, then that means the entire tank needs to be disconnected. What am I paying for? I reluctantly agreed because now we're on Day 4 of no hot water and the next day is Saturday.  Lowes gave me two phone numbers for Brad so I could try and talk with him directly. The first number no one answered. The second number turned out to be his cell - OOOPS! Brad answers and I explain my situation. He says he'll call the office and see about getting someone out the next day (Saturday). I hang up thinking GREAT - they realize this has been dragging on and they're going to do the right thing and get someone out here on Saturday. Well, guess what? I'm STILL waiting for Brad to call back. (Now DAY 5 of no hot water) When I told this to my Lowes rep, they admitted that they sometimes have trouble getting callbacks and prompt scheduling from BSJ. Sounds like it's time to get a new subcontractor. There are too many plumbers in the Valley to dink around with this kind of nonsense.  BTW? You can find a plumber that will not only come out on Saturday, but also do the install (including removing the old equipment) for a lot less than the almost $500 BSJ wanted. NEXT!

I needed some work done on my Quad, but I don't have a trailer to haul it. I came across Anthem Motorcycle and called. The owner, Jacob, was very professional. He arrived at my house and diagnosed the issues. Nothing very serious. A less reputable person could have definitely taken advantage in this situation. He's incredibly knowledgeable and even after fixing what was needed, he made sure to inspect the entire vehicle before signing off on it.  This business is thorough with amazing customer service. I'll definitely use them again and refer them to all my friends.

Received a card for this business in a direct mail, scenario. I needed a custom blind repair (broken string) and this came at the perfect time. Dialed the number and I could tell it was being forwarded to another number (623) 606-1959. The person who answered (Dan) seemed nice enough and said the first number is for his 'marketing team' to keep track of all the calls. OK. Asks me to text the second number with contact information and he'd get me on the schedule. 1 text, 2 text, 3 call, four call, five - NOTHING. NADA.  Did a little research and found a negative review on the BBB website and that's about it. If you received a card from the "Doctor", I'd suggest you get a second opinion.
