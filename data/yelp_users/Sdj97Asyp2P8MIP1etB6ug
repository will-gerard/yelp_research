What a great zoo! There is plenty more to do here than just watch the animals. We have a toddler and going to the zoo is now an entirely new experience... the petting zoo, splash pads, and playgrounds. We even became members for $85 for 1 year plus 2 guest passes. This zoo can be enjoyed all year round!

My wife and I had an amazing night enjoying the views, food, and service. The Hanger Steak was cooked to perfection and the risotto was a great addition. I tried my wife's pork tenderloin and it was just as good as the steak. We ended up eating off each other's plates. We were not disappointed and would come back. (They did lose our reservation, but they seated us.)

Overall, a good place to shop. This the the best Home Depot and hardware store in the area. They have helpful courteous staff members and good prices. For such a large warehouse it is easy to move around in and find what you need.

This library has been around for a long time. It used to be on 32nd St, north of Cactus in a small little building. They have a great selection of books, videos, and music. They also offer classes for your children for free. Books! Check'em out!

Wow, was I impressed with their fast service, impressive menu, and their amazing food. I had the sausage and pepper sandwich. It was amazing and huge... I made lunch out of it the next day also. My son gobbled up the chicken tenders and fries. This place is great for the whole family. I would return and recommend.

I have been here a few times and I have never been more impressed then "meh".  1) The space is small and cramped. There is very little room to move around and it is dark in side. The paintings and murals on the walls are nice. 2) The food is average. I love gyros, but theirs is nothing special. I like My Big Fat Greek Restaurant's more. You can get better french fries at McDonald's. 3) The customer service is ok. Our food came quickly, they tended to our needs/wants, but they did't make our experience memorable. 4) Their lunch prices are great, so I guess you get what you pay for.

Who doesn't like a fruit smoothie? They make healthy taste good! They are quick, friendly, and clean. However, I think they are a little over-priced. Try the wheat-grass juice...

The guys and gals that work here have always been efficient and helpful. They are not a service station, but will give you advice. Please don't rate them poorly because they didn't fix your car. You need to know what's wrong and have an idea of how to fix it before you come here. They will loan you some tools to change a battery or do very small repairs (if you are lucky they will even do it for you).

The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.

I hate going into this store. It is very disorganized, cluttered, and impossible to get assistance. When you do get assistance they are usually very short and rude in their responses. They seem to be trying to sell everything but hardware (ie. jewelry, clothing, and lighters).  The only reason I stop here is because of how conveniently located it is to my house.

I have been going here since I was a child (and it hasn't changed at all). I loved it then and I still love it now.  My favorite dishes are the Mongolian Beef and Almond Chicken, but they have plenty of other great dishes. They have a great lunch menu and very generous portions. Come hungry. Their dinners are served family style. The restaurant is a little dark and could use some new, updated decor.  Be sure to check out the huge mural on the north wall.

God gets 5 stars and so does Shiloh Community Church! My wife and I love this church. Pastor Jason is great and down to earth. He relates his sermons to your life and adds his own anecdotal life experiences (which are sometimes hilarious). The events they hold are amazing as well like: an Easter Egg Hunt open to the community for free and Tot Town in the summer for only $10. They have a wonderful daycare and even give you donuts and coffee before the service! It is an overall good feeling place to be.

Great beer! Good food! Friendly service! My wife and I enjoy coming here for dinner and a pint... or two... or three. We always get fast, friendly service. Don't forget your growler. The food is average bar food. Don't sit on the patio in the early evening, the sun will beat you up.

I stopped here with my dad for a quick dinner. It took longer than expected to get two half sandwiches and two half salads, but it was worth the wait. Dilly's Deli has great sandwiches made with fresh ingredients. This place had very little decor and felt a little plain and empty. They did have some neat art painted on the walls though. They need to add some thing on the walls and tables. Maybe a few plants around the place (fake ones would work too). Overall, we were pleased with our meal and would recommend it.

This is one of the best places in the valley to watch a theatrical performance. I have been here multiple times to see the Southwest Shakespeare Company and most recently to see Spamalot. There are multiple stages and the prices are very reasonable. Every show I have seen was very close and personal (I could even see expressions on the actors faces). I would highly recommend and will return.

The best Mongolian BBQ I have had. They have lots of choices to stuff in your bowl! Make sure you pack your bowl full because it shrinks when they cook it. They even provide papers to use to pack your bowl down and so your hands don't get messy. The sauce station is where the magic happens. They have plenty of recipes to follow or you can make up your own. They have great prices, lots of seating, and friendly customer service.

This my favorite pub in Phoenix! Good beer selections. Good food (the shepard's pie is amaze-balls, the Irish nachos are epic, and the frickles are delish). They have good live music / entertainment during the evenings. This is a great place to go during the day to hang out with friends, watch a game, have a quiet beer, or have an awesome night out partying. The weekend nights are a raging blast! The staff does a great job handling it all!

This is the best Fry's I have been too. It has a layout that makes it easy to get around and find what you need. The parking lot isn't terrible. They have good products and fast friendly customer service. They even have their own gas station and you get gas points for every dollar spent.  (History tidbit: This Fry's used to be across the street next to a Super X drugstore.)

We were the first ones here at 11am, so we had no problem getting a table. We ordered and our food came quickly, go figure. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It tasted great but fell apart after a few bites. The bun just didn't hold up. Red Robin has good food but nothing spectacular. A solid 4 star restaurant.

Costco is the best! They have great prices on all their goods. We love the free samples. Our 21 month old loves them too. Wether we are hosting a party or getting supplies for home, Costco always seems to have what we need.

The pizza is sub-average and the games are pretty lame. However, my 3 year old had fun putting tokens in the rides. The quality of CEC has really plummeted. The service was mediocre and slow . The store needs a deep cleaning and some updating. Peter Piper Pizza is a better choice for family fun of this kind.

Great Chicago-style pizza with great customer service. The cheese, crust, and sausage were amazing. They don't sell beer but allow you to bring your own. They brought us cold mugs for our beer. The decor was dated and lacking.

This is a great theater. They have decent prices for a movie, but the typical price gouge at the concession stand. We rarely buy anything but a refill on our loyalty cup. The theaters are clean and customer service is great. I would recommend this theater.

In its heyday (80s and 90s) I would have given it 4 stars, but it just doesn't have that mall energy or buzz any more. It has too many cheap specialty shops. The best thing about this mall is it is a cool place to go in the summer. It needs some serious updating to be more relevant to the times. However, my son loves the play area and "choo-choo".

The menu is huge, but the food is great. For breakfast, I would recommend the Bobka Crunch French Toast. It is amazing. This morning though, I went with the Jewish Sliders and I loved them. I would highly recommend these. The service can get a little slow when they get busy, but they handle it well. The staff is always friendly. Come hungry because the portions are huge.

This place it amazing! We brought our 22 month son to adventure around and we ALL loved it. There is so much to do, see, and learn here. Our son especially enjoyed putting the scarfs in the air chutes, the car tracks, and the tricycles. I liked the pool noodle forest the most. If you have kids, this is a great place to go on a hot summer afternoon.

The show gets 5 stars and the food / service gets 3 stars. We absolutely enjoyed the entire experience and the price was incredible. However, the food was barely warm (probably due to the mass feeding they have to conduct in a small amount of time). The service was slow and we were forgotten about a number of times. If you enjoy the theatre, then I recommend giving this place a try.

I am a huge gyro fan, and these guys did not disappoint! When we walked in we were greeted and all our questions were answered promptly. They even let us sample the meatballs that they raved about. I ended up ordering the original Gyro. There was plenty of meat balanced with the regular veggies. Having french fries with a gyro is a must and their's are pretty good. Overall, we had a good experience.

We had a wonderful dinner here before seeing a movie. We started with the Humble Pretzel, which was awesome! I highly recommend it. Then we split the Chopped Salad and Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage pizza. Both were as amazing as the pretzel. Topping it off with a few beers and some great customer service made this a memorable experience that I would recommend to others.

One of the employees was cleaning near by and handed me two straws. Not a big deal, but it means they are paying attention to their customers. The store itself is always clean.

You've got to love Target. This one is easy to get around in and find what you need. They have some great prices on many items. Now that they have the food section this place is a one-stop-shop. I have never had a problem with the customer service and the wait time in line is always minimum. I do have to agree with others that getting in and out of the parking lot is a pain.

We had a great time seeing and learning about the varieties of aquatic life. The displays were well executed and clean. The animals looked healthy, as well. My oldest son and I loved the stamp book. $18 a person isn't too bad, but if you have a large family it quickly becomes a steep bill. I am a teacher and was thinking about making a field trip out of this place, but after reading other reviews I am reconsidering it.

What a great place to take in a movie! This place is never busy. My wife and I have had a few "date nights" here. It is always quiet, comfortable, and reasonably priced. The concession stand prices are average for any movie theater though. I highly recommend this theater and will be returning.

They have some of the creamiest frozen yogurt I have had (most likely they don't add water). They have a fair amount of flavor choices, but I am not a fan of the tart favors. I want my "ice cream" sweet. They could use more topping choices. Overall, I'm a fan!

I have had a love-hate-love relationship with ZoYo. My family and I frequented this place for months trying all the flavor and topping combinations that met our fancies. Then for a few visits it seemed the quality of the yogurt declined. It wasn't as creamy or tasty any more and was icy (rumor was they added water to the yogurt to stretch the yogurt yield). My wife and I decided to try them again and we were pleasantly surprise to find their yogurt back on top of the menagerie of yogurt shops out there. One of the best for sure.

Busy, but the line moves fast. That seems to be a standard at Chipotle. However, I have to admit I love the food. I have never had a bad burrito/bowl and, it is always fresh. The amount of food is enough to fill you up with out the chips, but I always have to order them. There is something about the chips... a hint of lime, I think. The staff is very knowledgable and will answer all your questions.

A health food store this is not. Don't get me wrong, you can get healthy food here, but you have to wade through a sea of temptingly delicious processed food to find it. The prices on most everything are great. Be forewarned, you will have to bag your own groceries and the lines are long.

We came for dinner on a Friday night, there was no wait and our food came out very quickly. They forgot the fries I ordered but remedied it quickly. I had a large BBQ, Bacon, Cheddar Burger, fries, and a beer. It was very tasty and I ate the entire thing. I thought it was a little over priced... the fries should come with the burger. My wife had one if their salads and loved it. I was surprised a burger joint had a decent salad. I would return and recommend.

This is such a great place to get home decor for a good price! We recently bought a new house and have found ourselves here on occasion. Make sure you check any prospective purchases over, especially the corners, because some of their items are lightly damaged (which is one reason they can sell them for cheap). The customer service is friendly and helpful. Be careful they have one of those labyrinth check-out lines will lots of cheap items designed to make you think "I need that!".

We moved in near this park 8 months ago and instantly fell in love with it. Our toddler loves it too. There is a great playground, basketball court, sand volleyball court, and large grass field. There are a few picnic tables and barbecues as well. The city takes great care of this little gem. Also, there are no public restrooms.

It was awfully loud and a bit confusing when we ordered. We just milled about near the bar and read the menu. Then we went to the register to order. The girl at the register was very helpful and we got our orders placed. What is wrong with sitting down at a table and ordering?  The food didn't disappoint. I had the Terlingua (burger with chili con carne, corn chips, and cheddar cheese). It was a perfect combination. The amount of toppings didn't make the burger a sloppy mess when I ate it and I could still enjoy all the flavors. We got a large order of fries for the table. They came out first and were a bit cold when we got our burgers.  They have a very nice local beer selection, including a few nice hoppy ones. I didn't care for the chunky goblet-thing they served my beer in, though.  Overall, a great experience with great food and beer.

I love My Pie! They make pizza seem healthy while still tasting good. I had the Chicken Pesto Pizza and ate the entire thing. If you are hungry don't plan on sharing a pizza. You can order a signature pie/salad or make your own pie/salad. The price in very affordable for what you get. They have great ambiance with big open bay door. They are certainly trying to make the best out of a small space. I would return and recommend.

We received some of the worst service I have experienced in a long time. We got there before 4pm in hopes of getting 35 cent wings, but our server didn't show up until after 4pm. We explained that we were there in time for the special and she told us the computers switch over at four and there was nothing she could do. We ordered appetizers which took a long time to make it out. When they finally showed up they were cold, one was wrong, and they didn't taste good at all. I had to get up to find our server to ask for my tab because she was so absent the entire time. I found her talking with two other employees at the hostess stand. My tab never came. I asked again after she brought a friend's tab and it came. There were plenty of other servers just standing around that could have helped her. We decided not to eat dinner here because we didn't have two hours to wait and the food was gross. The only small saving grace is their beer selection. Needless to say, I won't be returning.

This Henry will literally serve you at any seat in there establishment. We had neglected making reservations and called while we were on our way. They told us they would be able to find room. When we got there the place was hopping and they explained that we could sit outside, in the lobby, or at a high top in the bar. We sat outside and a server arrived promptly to take our drink and appetizer order (the cheddar popovers and a beer). I order the C. B. & Rye. It had a large portion of corn beef and the rye was nice and crispy. The cabbage and onions balanced the while thing out.  Overall, the service and food were excellent. We would love to come back and experience the indoor ambiance. This was a great place to celebrate our anniversary. I would recommend it.

My wife and I had seen this place a few times and were intrigued. We were even more intrigued when we heard it was an oriental version of Chipotle. We decided to give it a try and loved it. You get to choose when goes in your bowl, like: rice, protein, veggies, sauces, and extras. It would be nice if they used white meat chicken. We were assured that each choice was made to compliment the others. So, you really couldn't make a poor combination. We loved it and would go back.

Some of the best yogurt I have had in the Valley. It is apparent that they do not add water to their yogurt because it is very creamy. I am not overly impressed with their selection of flavors. They have a great selection of toppings though, and we all know that is where the magic happens. Good customer service and decent prices too.

The first impression I had when we walked in was, "Wow, it's loud in here." It reminded me of a cafeteria. They sat the two of us at a tiny round table that had very little room. They had an unlit candle, a tall table number, a flower, and a bottle of water taking up the space (not to mention our water glasses, silverware, and menus). We got prompt service and I ordered a beer (which they didn't have, so I ordered a different one).  We ordered the bruschetta board and when it came the server looked at us, then at the tiny table, and at us again with a puzzled look. We tried to make room for this huge board she had in her hands. We told her she would need one of the two pizza racks in her other hand. She got it figured out and we made a comment about the tiny table. She then offered us tiny plates, we said no because there wasn't any room. We put the flower, candle, and number on the floor just to make room. The bruschetta was average. The best one was the salami pesto.  We ordered our food. My wife had the strawberry chicken salad and I had the bacon cheddar burger. There was nothing exciting about the salad. We asked about the chicken because it had a weird taste. Not a taste like it was bad, but like it was prepackaged and came out of a bag. We got the run around for a while and ended up getting a very vague response that didn't answer our question. The burger had all the flavor and excitement of a frozen "hockey puck" paddy. The fries were good, but I learned later that I could have gotten sweet potato fries but wasn't given the option.  On our way out, we went over to the market area and I watched the kitchen for a bit. What I saw here is the reason I will not go back. The kitchen was a hot mess. The floor was littered with trampled food. The cook was disheveled and did not look professional at all. He was wearing a pair of gloves, but I don't think he understands what the gloves are supposed to do. I watched him prepare a salad (including breaking cheese apart with his hands). Then bend down and open a drawer to get something else out. He grabbed the spatula and flipped a burger. He also grabbed a disgusting looking lid that was covering some vegetables, scooped up the vegetables with his hands, and then put them on someone's plate. He did all this with the same pair of gloves on. The gloves should be used for sanitary purposes, not to keep his hands clean. I never saw him change the gloves or clean his hands.  Overall, we were rather disappointed. Other than the decor, this place was nothing special. We could have stayed home, made the same meal for cheaper, and eaten at a real table.

What a great park! The splash pad is a great place to take your kids to cool off during a hot summer day. The playground is new/updated and the entire park is very clean and well maintained. There are plenty of shade trees too. This park is an oasis in the city! The only thing it doesn't have are public bathrooms.

Ah, Mr. Cooks... your food is delicious, Your menu is a tasty item menagerie. Your dining area cleanliness is suspicious, Always opt for pick-up or delivery.  I have never been disappointed with my meal, Egg rolls, sweet and sour pork all tasty. But the people on the phones, what's the deal? At least the food is always done hastily.

Good beer...good food. My wife and I have been here once for lunch and once for dinner. They have some very tasty bar food that is better than the average and a good selection of beers. We loved their Pub Pretzels! I had the grinder and fries the first time, which I really enjoyed. I would not recommend the pulled pork sandwich. It did not taste freshly bbq'ed. It seemed like is was cooked somewhere else, refrigerated, and then reheated. The beers are the true test of a brew pub and theirs don't disappoint. I have had the Scottish Ale and Upshift IPA. Both are good beers that I would have again. I would recommend and return.

My wife and I came for lunch and loved it. A very spacious interior provides a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere quiet enough to talk without over hearing those around you. The restaurant was very clean and seemed to be a point they are proud of as well. I had the Italian Panini and a Lumberyard IPA. The panini was delicious and would recommend it. The have a good beer selection too. The service was timely and accurate and the prices were fair. I recommend this place.
