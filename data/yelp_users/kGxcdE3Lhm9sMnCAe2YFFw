The service there is the best!    Took the wife there for her birthday and they made sure that is was AWESOME!!!  Our server Justin was very helpful and was johnny on the spot with the food and drinks.  Speaking of drinks, you know it's great service when your glass is always full.  Their special right now with 8oz filet and lobster tail was very filling and barely had room for dessert!

Just stopped by to see the selection and prices and it was very competitive.  They are now a specialized seller.

Heard about this place from Diners, dives, and drive-ins.  They were originally located off of 7th and union hills and have moved to Anthem.  If you ask my son the Chorizos, eggs, and papas burritos are the best.  The staff is friendly.  Can be busy sometimes.  The mexican pizza is excellent.    They are closed on Sunday.  Sorry no burritos or menudo for football.

Joe is the owner, I believe and he is very polite.  He definitely has some of the best prices in town.    I purchased a firearm from him and the service I got is awesome.  Very courteous and his specials are the best.  I would buy from him for the service alone.

Went there for Veteran's Day for dinner and let me tell you AAA+ on the meal and staff.  We were running late and they were very accommodating.  The staff was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed.  The food there is excellent and the atmosphere is beautiful.    If you want to impress someone or have a romantic night dinner then this is place to go.  A. W.

Probably, rated as one of the worst lunches I had.  Food wasn't cooked to order and it was very tough.  Appetizer was nasty and tasted spoiled.  (They did take it off).  Even the dessert wasn't that good.

First, Let me say Boar's head meat.  The best!  Price is very reasonable.  Each sandwich comes with chips and drink.  Ice tea is very good.  Service is great and fast!  seating is inside and outside, now that the weather is getting good it was nice to sit outside.  You can get your sandwich on a bagel or different types of bread.

As a fellow Asian American.  I always would have to go to the east side to get great authentic Chinese food.  Many individuals will probably go for the orange chicken and kung pao chicken.  I have to tell you that the duck here is one of the best that i have ever had.  The meat is tender and it is not all greasy and oily.  I have also had a the green beans and beef.  The green beans were still fresh tasting and the beef is very tender.  We also had the napa tofu which is a vegetarian dish that is very tasty.    At first I was going to give them 4 stars, but the more that I eat there the more I love this place.  Take it from a traditional Asian couple this place is well worth the try,

My wife and I love to try different places to eat.  Went to this restaurant, and I have to say our first impression, we sat down and ordered hot tea.  Little did we know that there was many different types of hot teas that they have.  Another non Asian wait staff came over and informed us of this.  She was the best thing at this place.  Very helpful and extremely friendly.    The food however was so so.  Egg fu yung had hardly any taste at all the sizzling beef was tender but over all the price was very high and not worth that much for the food taste.

For the price it has a great selection and you can't beat the price.  20 bucks for all that you can eat from not just a selection, but from the whole menu.  Not bad at all!.  The sushi chef and owner also came to our table to ask if we needed anything else that is service.  Now from the servers some are good and some are not.  The good thing is that you can wave down any of the server and they will be happy to help you out.    The best thing about this restaurant is that they you don't have to just have sushi or sashimi all that you can eat, but also have a wide selection of other items such as tempura, ramen, fried rice, and salads (squid, seaweed, or regular).    Conclusion, as for the distance from me, I would take the 40 min drive to go to this restaurant again and again,  I liked the personal attention from the owner (sushi chef)  They do have a reservation online that you can do and 20 buck for all that you can eat.  You can't beat that.  They only down side is that when it is busy you may have to wait to be seated, but that is expected.   The bathroom is awesome, which is weird to say.  Wait till you see it.

Ok, where do I start.    First it is Father's day.  Ask my father where he wants to go and his friend recommended this place.    Sunday, the 19th of June, record breaking heat of 120 degrees.   We should have turned around and left once we felt the temperature of this place, which was about 90+.  It a sad day in a restaurant, when the patrons in the establishment have to tell them to turn down the thermostat or turn on a fan.  Asked if they could turn down the heat and they told me that they just had the A/C fixed, but still wasn't turned down.    Second, ordered the chashu bun with pork.  Did you ever microwave a bun and then after words the bread is hard as a rock.  Well there you go.    Lastly, the ramen.  Ordered 2 different types.  Original and spicy.  It came out and it looked original to me and asked them about it and they stated that there was spice on the table.  A little bit later my spicy one came out.  Go figure.    Don't think that I will recommend this place and the noodles wasn't up to par.    Only good thing was our waitress.
