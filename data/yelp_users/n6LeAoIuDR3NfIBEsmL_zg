This place is the real deal.  No server, just order at the counter and wait for your magic number to be called.  There are so many tempting things around you to eat while you are waiting which just makes you feel like you are waiting forever.  They serve beer here so that's good to know.  If you are looking for a restaurant experience then go somewhere else.  The burritos are HUGE and the plates all come with rice and beans (this is important to me LOL) the salsas are all very good.  I will be eating here again!

Food was excellent.  Kind of in a crappy part of town.  They pour healthy glasses of wine =-) and the food is served in a presentation format.  The decor made me feel like Scarface might be sitting a few tables away.  The decor in the bar is dated and the mirrors all over the place made me feel funny.  The service was FANTASTIC and you feel very comfortable making conversation without worrying about being "too loud".

Definite dive but the food was good.  They dont have carne Asada??!  That is weird to me...  Only green chile or red chile on the menu.  I was thinking- maybe they dont serve it becuase the meats too expensive- but then; there was tons of people in there so how can they NOT afford the meat when Filibertos has it??  Lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 BURRITO and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas... Im sorry- but that's way too long for simple taco truck orders.  The salsa cups are like the size of a THIMBLE so I had to like use a tray to carry over 7 thimbles of salsa to our table.  The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town. The gauc is good.  It was all good but  the menu isn't something to RAVE about.  Im mexican so I could have made all the items on the menu by the time my ticket was called.

I want to start off with saying that everytime I drove by stockyards and saw that giant bull/cow on the top of the big, plain, white building, I always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground.   It's totally not.  It is like a rich Texan's house inside.  Cow rug, leather, old cowboy photos on the wall.  So the ambiance inside is totally nice and upscale-cowboy feel.  got sat in the main dining room and I also want to add like I felt like the place was "dusty" I don't know why, or what made me feel this way, but "dusty" was what I got from the place.  I ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad. So- my ribs were just "okay" and my potatoes were SUPER SUPER garlic-ey and it was weird how they were plated.  They came out like in a square shaped form of scalloped potatoes.  Like my mom makes potatoes and squares my piece out for me sort of square.  The square was small, but actually I didn't even like the potatoes so that did not bother me too much.  OH! and "cole-slaw" my other side I ordered was "cole-slaw". Notice how I put " " around this word "cole-slaw".  I do that because it wasn't cole-slaw AT ALL!?!?!? It was literally just shredded up dry cabbage!?!??! So... yeah, didn't eat the slaw.  their famour bar that is completely hand carved and the murals on the walls are hand-painted and restored from like the 1900's so the bar was very cool.   Go for a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't do dinner again.

When I'm hungover we crawl to Los Taquitos and I usually get a big bowl of posole to heal my wounds.  It is so damn good.  They give you the necessary extras like red onions chopped, cilantro, limes, and tapatio.  You can either get corn (my preference) or flour tortillas to dip in your soup.  Out of all the things I have ordered, (besides the breakfast burritos) the posole is my absolute favorite and has never let me down.

My date insisted I post his review.  Again, HE wrote this- NOT ME...  I had high hopes for this place's cannolis, but I was quite disappointed. I entered the establishment and was greeted by a very bubbly women, who really talked up the cannolis and offered me a spoonful of the cannoli filling. I obliged, and tasted the filling and it was satisfactory. I didn't want to be rude so I still ordered a few cannolis giving the establishment the benefit of the doubt that they would be better in their wrapping. Boy was I wrong... The wrapping was poor at best. It was much too hard and pretty much ruined my day. The bubbly women told me that if I wanted to order some for the holidays I would have to order them far in advance as there are so many people ordering them during the holiday season. Pfffff no need to worry about that, as I will not be back. I don't know if the people who are ordering these cannolis in mass are stupid or just have never had a proper cannoli. I guess I'll just choose to believe the latter. PS I am writing this as I sit on my toilet with explosive diarrhea, that I suspect was caused from the cannoli.

Ordered shrimp pad Thai for lunch cost me $10. It is fine if it's $10, if it is good. It wasn't. I read good reviews and was hoping to be completing a review with food stuffed in my mouth and belly full of shrimp and joy. Anyways- I opened my to-go box and found two itty bitty spring rolls and some sauce. The spring roll did not taste good at all so I ignored the second one. My pad Thai was dry :-(. I am lucky I asked for hot sauce to pour over. The shrimp wasn't cleaned out so I got to have a little task of cleaning the poop out of the shrimp before I ate it. That was fun.... I threw $10 into the trash. It wasn't enjoyable. That's sad because I like Thai food.

This place is great!  Good food, and good service.  We had a large group HH and our server Jay was very patient and happy to suggest plates over others.  I told him my dad was back in the US from Afghanistan and the owner came out to let me dad know all his drinks/meal were on the HOUSE! whoot whoot!! America!! F**ck yea!! Anywho- this place has a super cool patio with a walk way bridge over water.  New Mexican food is the cuisine and they give big portions and rich in flavor :-)

RUDE staff that wouldn't spit on you if you were on Fire... mixed up our party's orders, ignored us when we needed waters.  Honestly, it was the attitude of the staff that completely turned me OFF to this historic restaurant.

From beginning to the end, Durants was flawless.  No windows in the place, and red booths fill the room.  a large inviting bar, and old rat pack feel from the place.  If I could afford to dine here often I would be one fat and happy girl.

took the BF for lunch and he insisted on doing the review....  Ok so first time at this beautiful looking place very traditional look. First thing first ... No hot sauces...no beans... No tortillas....I was served an italian loaf in stead of tortilla chips...fries which is American with my tacos....and I could of made more traditional guacamole at home.... Sorry barrios cafe. You are not a "best in phoenix Mexican restaurant"

I have heard about all the past famous diners here such as President Bush, and many athelets, etc.  We walked in around 6pm and was like, "THIS is the place? are you SURE? is it even OPEN???"  it was dead inside.  Ill just skip to the food part-  I ordered this dish that came with a ground beef taco, cheese enchilada, and beef tamale.  All of it was good expect the tamale which tasted "grainy"  ok here we go, long story short I wont be going again but glad I went to SAY I've been.

It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.

Went for lunch, patio was full so we waited at the bar for 10 minutes.  Once sat, I contemplated over the menu as there were many items I wanted to try.  I've been before, but it was so long ago when the place first opened so I feel like it was trying the place for the first time.  I ordered the braised pork tacos and they were very filling.  I was going to take a to-go box but there were like 10 birds in the trees above I was paranoid one slipped some shit into my plate while I looked away.  All that being said, lovely patio, busy with local diners, and the food is good with healthy options.

No freezer in the joint so when they run out of OJ they have to literally go and buy more oranges!  The food is fresh and homeade.  I haven't been to their newest location which I hear is much larger inside to accomodate the massive breakfast crowds.

My mom took me here and we were the only non-Asian people in the place so we were VERY excited.  It was not very busy but it was during the week so maybe that was the reason.  We ordered hot green tea to start with then I ordered the won ton soup and my mom ordered a dinner special that was chicken chow mien with friend rice, 2 crab puffs, and 1 egg roll (I ate the crab puffs :-D ).  My won ton soup was HUGE and absolutely delicious!!  I want to tell the world about this place to share it's deliciousness.  It had wontons, chicken, shrimp, and steak pieces all inside this soup.  I couldn't finish it all and packed the leftovers for the BF to enjoy.   I'll be back (Arnold voice).

This place is busy, had live music in the bar, and the servers were trying to squeeze by.  The seafood is flown in DAILY and I think our bill helped fund a grouper or two's first class seat.  I ordered the grouper with crab on top (as an extra- you can ask for it this way).  Ordered the lobster mashed again, and green beans (if it ain't broke- don't order something else.).  Had a great night!

Awesome service, great menu, quiet dining room with low music playing in background,  and patio seating available but no great view.  We got the appetizer trio and it was DELICIOUS~ The trio includes large shrimp sitting in grits, second was cut up steak with paired rice with a sort "asian" flavor to it, and third was dungess crab and artichoke dip with bread!!! Just remembering the flavors makes my taste buds leak!  I ordered my filet mignon medium-well. Our server was knowlegable of the menu and explained that it would seasonally be changing. It was a great dining experience so glad we did it!

we walked in, it was a ghost town at 5pm, walked up- ordered our dishes and special priced beers ( Stella and Shock top ale super cheap) and like 30 seconds later it was called out ready to go!! My bf says he sees this place smoking all their stuff early in the morning and the result: DELICIOUS RIBS!!! literally fall off the bone hell- i could have EATEN the bone it was all slow cooked to perfection. Baked beans, potato salad all delicious. I made a point to compliment the owner and he treated me to their HOMEMADE ice cream (vanilla bean) to take home =-) we WILL be back and this time, I'm bringing more people. I tell as many people I can about this unknown treasure we have finally discovered.

Had a great time enjoying Northern Italian with some Greek options also.  This place has it ALL! Duck, veal, shrimp, salmon, lamb, halibut, chicken, pasta, calamari, and meatballs!  It was all very delicious and the service was great.  The servers had great personalities and the ambiance is upscale and dim.  Nice patio also.  Accessible via the lightrail for those of you that take advantage of public transportation.

Meh. The place is good.  Their salsa is no good though and that is the main reason I never crave this place.  Their California burrito and breakfast burritos are good though.  I hardly crave or request this place but it's edible and I wouldn't turn it down if someone wanted to go there.  There's better is all.  Casual inside and you order at the counter.

I have been wanting to try this place out for a MINUTE ever since I found it online randomly.  Finally, I got a girl-date and I couldn't find the place for the life of me.  It is in the fresh and easy parking lot which is busy and packed.  I really expected the salon to be located elsewhere and have a a more appealing curbside look to it.  I go in and there was about 6 other women in the place.  The inside is lovely like shown online but it is rather on the small side.  The girls that work there are all very pretty and stylish.  I was given an option of either lemonade or water in a glass and magazines.  I really enjoyed my experience and if I could financially afford to make this my biweekly nail spot I gladly would, but at $45 a pedicure, this place will be staying in my "Haven't had girl time let's go here to this cute place and treat myself to a fancy pedicure".  When I say fancy- I just mean expensive.

My dad ordered a chile relleno.... and it came out with what looked like chicken inside?? what the??? I flagged down our sweet server Norma who said although she would never dare make her own chile relleno that way, Aunt chilada's does.  It seriously looked like canned chicken and I was shocked they would ruin a simple dish like that by adding chicken stuffed inside.  My dish was just simple taquitos and the chicken was so dry it was near jerky.  Salsa was average... nothing about this place was "mexican" and the ducks all over the place kinda grossed me out.  NEVER again will I spend my $ or allow anyone to spend theirs while in company.  Aunt Chilada's... you FAIL!

I've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to North Phoenix.   I walked in and the whole "Man vs Food" situation was posted everywhere.  I decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta. I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when i asked for chips and salsa the server said they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  The torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) ok so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is every animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) ok so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and a sprite.  I tried it at least? Bleh.

BEST steak in town hands down!  Great crowd, live music, professional servers, wonderful menu.  The LOBSTER mashed potatoes are a MUST TRY on the menu!! I had one martini and couldn't finish the second because the first one did enough damage :)  housemade whipped cream with dessert literally made me dance in my chair.  Fantastic, fun place to go on a date~!!

Every employee that we interacted with was extremely friendly and outgoing and get this..... SMILING! who does that anymore???  Anyways-  they all were really fun and made our dining experience so much more comfortable than other snobby places in Scottsdale.  For example: Bungalow Bar and Grill.  I LITERALLY walked into the place and greeted the employees... Isn't that THEIR job?? Ok- I'm getting off topic.  PEARL sushi is good sushi for a tolerable price and has great employees that look happy to be there. SHOUT OUT to our server/bartender Christina Lee.  That girl was so funny!!

Yelped out for what was nearby and found this place.  It's in a shopping plaza and just a little restaurant.  I ordered a gyro salad and small fry (shhh...!) The salad was bomb bomb bomb diggity no doubt!! I ate my entire salad and actually threw most of the fries away because I was so full from my fresh, flavorful salad.  The salad came with shredded iceberg, Lamb meat, one pepperoncini ( would have appreciated more), tomatoes, red peppers, red onions, and cucumbers.  It was lovely.  I am thankful I yelped the "around me" option to find this family owned spot.

We love mojo!  Its not as evil of a treat and the flavors are so yummy! A minor downfall is how the mix-ins are sometimes hard to reach and I've seen a girl literally put her whole head into the bar and that grossed me out with the idea others have done the same... Aka- possible human debris and hair in my yogurt!

We gave this place 2 chances, both ending with a FAIL!  This place is close to where I live so we were hoping to find a great bar with good food.  Unfortunately, what we found was quit opposite.  First time, I ordered a chicken sandwich and got a burger instead... Second time- We went in to watch the UFC fights since they post all over the outside "UFC headquarters"... right when we walk in... the place was still not busy so we thought "great, here before the crowd"  well... this lady came up to us asking loudly "IS IT JUST YOU TWO?" as we go to a table she asks if we can MOVE to the table next to us, "because it gets really busy" so we went to the bar instead and sat.... So I really felt like we as customers, were not appreciated!! They wanted to MOVE US out of the way for "real" customers I guess....  SKYBOX YOU FAIL

Once again, I found myself in an area that I was unfamiliar of what there is to eat.  I pulled out my yelp and looked up "greek restaurants" nearby.  Gyro House popped up and had good marks.  I ordered the greek salad with gyro meat and it cost me about $9.00. My order came out in good time and it was PACKED with gyro meat. Good flavor and filling. I could have used more pepperconi and tomato but no biggie it was still done well. I probably won't find myself this far north Phoenix again, BUT if I do- I would certainly visit Gyro House.

Went this morning.  Ordered a ham torta sandwich and coffee.  You have to order sides as an extra but the sandwich alone filled me up and I was only able to eat half!! The coffee was great and I mentioned it to our server.  "IT'S CARTEL COFFEE"  well that's WHY!!!!!!!!!!!! omg I love Cartel and so stoked this place is right by our place!  The scene is hipster and service is slow like the servers "just work there, but don't really need the money sort of way".  Still- ill go back- and be patient, because the food is good and the coffee is bomb and its close to my house.

El Chorro sits right on the backside of Camelback mountain and has a southwestern decor and gorgeous patio.  Casual dress or a nice dress could be worn here.  The menu has a variety of options.  We started off with a shrimp pot dish and it was deelish.  My entree was trout almondine with green beans ( ordered a separate side of scalloped potatoes also)  My dish was prepared perfectly and didn't walk out feeling overly stuffed (like my usual) so I felt pretty good about myself for having the self discipline to not order a dessert.  Sit on the patio if you can!!!!

We went in around 830pm on a Friday night and it was very quiet inside.  We asked about any DJ or live music and the bartenders explained that they have a DJ but not sure when they were coming in.  We had a couple of drinks and hung out for about 45 min. and still no music.  This bar has so much potential with it's awesome location within the historical Hotel San Carlos.  I was so disappointed to not have it be more lively or organized enough to have a DJ that comes in a specific time each night on the weekends.  Prices were average for the bar.  It felt like this place hasn't been updated in a while and there is like a huge bubble lamp with a hot pink light inside.......... the cool part is the chandeliers and the "VIP" section that looks like my grandma's living room.

LOVE the set up, decor, and look of the Vig Uptown.  Very modern and trendy.  I felt like I got a little cooler (as if possible right??) from just being there.  Accommodated our large party of 15 or so people and were very friendly.  The menu is sort of random and I wasn't digging anything on it so I just ordered the artichoke dip.  A lot of the girls ordered the macaroni dish which was HUGE (why?)  but very delicious.  Had a great time and would definitely visit again.  The staff was great, I must mention again.

Located in the Heart of Downtown Phoenix, the salon is next door to the entrance of the Hyatt.  It is a small salon that does it ALL!  Nails/Hair/Massage/Facials/Make up Services/Waxing...etc!  I had a D.T massage and I'm a new woman!!  Michelle (tiny woman bless her soul) worked out all my knots and kinks I could not believe how great i felt afterward!  I just believe that as women, we push and push ourselves to make everyone else in our lives happy- that massages are something we need to release all the stress from those accomplishments.  Okay- done preaching about that!  NOW- on to my facial....... the facial..... was just plain pampering at its best!  Facials are by no means a "necessity" in life, they exist merely to make you feel like a princess.  This was my FIRST facial and  I felt like a princess! My skin was glowing after wards and was so soft!  I literally had my boyfriend, mother, and sister TOUCH my soft face.  VERY convenient for those of you that work downtown and want to get pampered while rush hour traffic is happening!

I usually only give 1 star to places so I guess that means I'd go back right? yea- I'd go back I guess. "BEST" carne asada burrito???? I dunno???....... we thought about it and the meat WAS good. BUT its too pricey. we bought 2 carne asada burritos (not very big BTW), ceviche, 2 beers and it was $28 bux. dude- that is too expensive for a taco shop. the ceviche was NO good. like- at all. don't order it. Next time, yes- Next time, I'm gonna order just carne asada TACOS and see if I like it better.

This is a casual spot to eat with friends before going out into old town.  Servers are hit or miss but just this last visit our server was very flexible with the menu and willing to change/add things to make us happy.  They recently added sushi to the menu which was odd to my friends since the place is a chinese restaurant.  I really didn't care and just ordered 2 rolls which were pretty good!  The spicy tuna was "meh" and the crouching dragon roll was Deelish!  LOVE edamame and the server suggested some sauce but gave it on the side "in case" I didn't like it- but it was really good, so glad she offered it!  The half portions are very large so no need to order the whole size unless your sharing.  They don't have Sapporo LIGHT which kinda sucks because of the extra calories.  Great open bar and cool happy hour spot.

I'm convinced everywhere I go sucks. This place was at the chandler mall. nice ambiance inside and family oriented. the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever. the marinara sauce didn't have any spices or hint of authentic Italian to it. the whole menu is literally spaghetti so don't go with the idea of getting any other kind of Italian dish. the meatballs same thing. no big Italian taste or spiciness. the appetizer- the artichoke dip was bland. felt like old people food or kid friendly food. nothing for your palette to discover. very BLah. just save your money and go to Oregano's where your never disappointed I guess.

We went on a Sunday around 11am we got seated right away.  The menu is trying to be like a new-american style type of menu.  I ordered chicken and waffles and the Bo ordered a breakfast burrito.  Our meals took around 25 minutes to come out and my boyfriend even commented saying how all the people sitting next to us NO ONE had a plate in front of them.  Sunday must have been a new employee training day because there was so many kids wandering around and around the restaurant with no real task at hand.  The coffee.... the coffee was good.  Then, FINALLY our food came out.  My chicken was good and it was a baked chicken breast breaded.  My waffle was HALF a waffle.  Two pieces came out and they were toasted cajun style (like a brick) i think they were seasoned with a pepper or something too?  My scrambled eggs came out already mixed with syrup.  Boy's burrito came out on a green pita wrap tortilla and carne mixed with eggs and some avocado on the side.  The "carne" or meat had a lot of fat on it.  Breakfast was $30.  I wont be back.

Went on CINCO DE MAYO, the world's most popular day to EAT, DRINK, and ENJOY anything (wink wink) thats spicy or from south of the border.  Ok- so we never tried Los Dos before and kept hearing amazing things about this place.  We were so excited to hear about its new location in Awhatukee since we live in the area.  We walk in around 3pm... Ambiance: It was dark, put our name in the hat and there was a hour wait. ok fine, we drank on the patio patiently while listening to the speakers outside play COUNTRY MUSIC (at a mexican joint???) Service:  Bar was out of corona??? (on cinco de drink-o???) yet, about an hour later we saw them being served to customers inside.   Salsa- ok, so the salsa was bomb. and super HOT!! caliente! I felt in the next day after my morning coffee.  i'd go back for the damn salsa. Service ONCE seated... we got sat down and were handed paper menus that were all wrinkled from having water soaked in them a few times then dried out.  We sat down and 2 seconds later our server asked what we wanted to order.  We said we were still deciding and he asked "DECIDING WHAT? LIKE WHAT TO ORDER OR IF YOUR GONNA ORDER?" basically- attitude. We left our table and walked out the restaurant.  LOS DOS is phoenix i hear is amazing though?

60 beers on tap... what else do i need to say? ok- ill say more.  They are on the second floor at Cityscape downtown and the bar has a enclosed patio area that overlooks the downtown area.  The inside bar has live bands, open mic, and jazz on different nights of the week.  More of an upscale bar that a business person goes to after work with friends i wouldnt categorize this as a "night club".  Again 60 beers on tap.

Stopped here for lunch during happy hour.  Place was quiet but a dog was on the patio which I liked, so if you have a dog- bring them along.  We ordered the sausage pizza, chili, chicken drumlets (aka wings), and a salad (for me).  The salad was AMAZING!!! It was so fresh and had yummy cuts of fresh mozzarella and green beans, etc. it was just so damn good.  The pizza was great and the chili made me think of thanksgiving it was just so hearty.  Wings were wings nothing amazing.  It was just a beautiful AZ afternoon on the patio with a great lunch.

Our server was great, attentive and personable!! You dont find that much these days so that is why im complimenting this location.  We ordered a beef something salad (AMAZING!), chicago pan pizza (takes 45 min. btw), and my FIRST EVER pizza-cookie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! how on earth did it take me so long to get one? I dont know... I have discovered a new vice and that is the pizza cookie!! My only drag about this place is how they dont take reservations... which is lame to me since the waits are always so long * we got sat right away last night though!!  Im just SAYING- they should take reservations.  Oregano's and the service was awesome.

Stumbled in due to its close proximity from the Tavern.  I ordered chips with nacho cheese and a bean burrito.  The cheese was really watery but I stuck to those instead of my bean burrito since it was FILLED with beans that tasted like they were from a can and were so thick and pasty.  I flagged down a server and asked for a glass of water in exchange so my throat would be cleared out from the beans!  The manager came over to let me know he took it off my bill and that he "tries to steer his customers AWAY from the beans"........... well- why don't you just STOP serving them??? tsk... tsk..... tsk.... I would have preferred Taco Bell instead!!

went for lunch and I made the mistake of ordered the shrimp tacos and a Smithwicks because I was craving them. The food came and my tacos were whack Besides all that, our server was crappy.  She never came around to ask if we wanted another round of brews... LAME. As a pub- they should be bringing barrels to us.  The bill was $50.00. the end.

OsKar with a "K" was our server and was super prompt with all of our orders and had a nice personality.  This place is casual and could use a lot more in the decoration department, but the food is what's more important and the food..... was GOOD!!! So fresh, healthy, just plain YUMM... My cousin eats here on the reg and had been trying to get me to try this place for the longest time.  I think I tried everything on the menu!! got some sesame bread and eggplant dipping sauce (it looked gross but tasted good so try it!!).  Tried the lentil soup, some cucumber-red onion-tomato salad (amazing), and a lamb dish with delicious white rice.  It's sad how i actually used to LIVE in Ankara, Turkey and my memory of the dishes left me!! Glad we finally went because places like this are far and few. It's right by a tattoo parlor and old bar but I don't see this all deterring diners.  Also- it has an "A" grade posted in case you are curious.  Go here and enjoy!!

A cute and hip place to have some wine with a girlfriend or a date. It's super busy and usually has a wait. It is NOT quiet but busy with conversation. Love the $20 board and bottle specials on Monday and Tuesday nights. They cork the bottle for you so you can take it home.

Went with the Bestie to this spot and at first had trouble finding the entrance but entered a totally trendy, hip, casual restaurant.  LOVE the look of the dining room. LOVE how the "warehouse" ceilings are very high.  This place just looks so cool inside.  The bar is to the left and had people staged there and there are couches to just hang out with your drink.  The kitchen is open so you can see the cooks back there.  If your looking for an aesthetically eye-pleasing spot- go here. Service was great, our server was knowledgeable on the menu and ingredients, waters kept being refilled, and our table was checked on throughout the meal.  We started with the shrimp and grits app. (very good 5 decent shrimps), I ordered the mahi, and Mal ordered the chicken.  We both ordered a cocktail as well and those were VERY strong! My fish was a pretty large piece and had some horseradish sauce on top (meh- coulda done without it or at least on the side.)  The fish was cooked very well and I enjoyed it.  Mallory's chicken was a huge piece of like a breast, thigh, and mini-wing attached.  It looked so juicy!  She said it was very good and I got to try a piece and it was great.  The sides are a la carte so we chose mashed potatoes, and the cauliflower.  The cauliflower was really good and seasoned with lemon and other spices.  The mashed potatoes was blended so much it was almost soup.  I've had better potatoes. bill was 107.00 for the two of us. The meal was good and the place was very trendy.  If you have a birthday or other special celebration coming up totally go here.

Poor customer service. Ordered a watermelon smoothie but requested of I could change my order- they charged me for both since both drinks were made.

This place has a really chill, almost a hipster feel to the place (normal for downtown PHX).  All the servers are "cool" and no one is in a big hurry.  We split this steak sandwich with fries and we also split a flight of 6 beers to get an idea of what we'd order as our "real" drink.  I ended up ordering the Old Chub (Scottish Ale) and it was dark and amaze balls.  I enjoyed the beer and the food was average but definitely homemade so I would say the quality is good (a little bland but nbd) instead of ketchup we got some tomato blend.  I personally would have just enjoyed the ketchup.  Someone dropped a glass and I swear they swept for like 20 minutes (hipster slow) The bathrooms are unisex and clean BUT---- it smelt like piss in there..... I dunno I think the urinal might be the culprit..  There are 31 craft beers on tap and I am a huge fan of craft beers.

Ordered pho with chicken to go. The inside was nicer than I anticipated as I was just wanting to grab lunch. There were people sitting and enjoying lunch with servers delivering their dishes. I ordered at the bar. $8 for my soup. When I opened my soup the soup container had just broth and the to go box has the noodles, shredded chicken, sweet chili paste, cilantro, onions, jalapeño,basil, and bean sprouts. I put all of it except the basil into my broth. My ears were ringing from the heat, my nose was running, my heart was stolen. I will be back- and this time with a lunch date!!!!

Pam Love does awesome things to my hair.  She asked me questions about preferences and then went right to work. I have an insane amount of hair and she was working efficiently through it.  The salon is in a nice area and her space is very cute.  Glad I was referred and plan to continue working with Pam.
