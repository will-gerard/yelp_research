I love this spot. Great food, coffee, pastries and there's a bar! A lot of people come here to study during the day.

Avoid this company at all costs! Share My Coach has been nothing short of a complete and utter nightmare. Darrell (whom runs this location) is the most cynical and distasteful person I've ever met. The individuals running this business were disorganized and acted as if it were a huge inconvenience answering simple questions on how to operate the RV we were renting. Upon return of our RV, we were accused of damaging it and were charged $1,000. We spoke to the CEO about the matter and asked for an itemized receipt, since Darrell was not willing to provide one. The CEO was also ill-mannered and aggressively told us that they don't need to provide us with an itemized receipt for the $1,000 charge. Honestly, this business was unprofessional at best and I felt nothing short of disrespected.
