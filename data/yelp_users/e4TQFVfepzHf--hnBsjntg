BBQ-liquious.  That's all I have to say.  Order it for the whole office.  They do office luncheons.

Tasty independent veggie friendly lunch spot close to downtown.  Very impressive list of wraps.  Fresh soup prepared daily.  The only ticks against it are that parking can be a problem and it takes a long time for them to prepare the food around the lunch hour. My tip - call your order in and pick it up.

I am a huge fan of MCM, so it's no surprise that I am now a big fan of Red Modern Furniture.  The space is lovely and large.  And it is filled with beautifully maintained vintage pieces.  I was charmed when the sales person (owner?) walked up to me and said "May I help you find something?  Each piece has a story."  Indeed.  In my mind I purchased a desk (circa 1930), a walnut platform bed (danish, circa 1960), 2 oversized lamps, and a coffee table that wouldn't fit anywhere in my house.  As I sadly walked to the door, I noticed a take-out box stamped "Lola Tapas" next to the register.  "Oh, is Lola good? I've been meaning to check it out."  "Well, I'm a little biased.  My brother owns Lola.  He also opened a coffee shop called Lux.  And he is opening a cafe next to Lola soon."  That opened the door.  We proceeded to discuss the various independent restaurants of the Phoenix-metro for the next several minutes.  Kindred spirits, for sure.    (Side note:  The store also carries art and a small selection of vintage clothing and accessories.)

Lovely botanical gardens.  This is staple on my out-of-towner itinerary.  It is quite enjoyable to walk around and check out the bizarre native vegetation.  It it much more diverse than you would imagine.  The Sonoran desert is lusher than you might imagine.

This is the kind of place you find in a mall.  Fast food salad, pasta and pizza.  I had a salad/pizza combo.  The pizza was cold and the crust had a weird metallic taste.  The salad was your standard plate of bland greens.  With all the offices and the hospital nearby, you would think there would be better options for lunch in this shopping plaza. Nope.  That's why I always end up at the Good Egg.  It's hard to screw up an omlette. Despite the high convenience factor, I will not be back.

This place is okay.  If I am going to consume a days worth of calories in one meal, however, this is not my first choice of venues.  Go to Carolina's instead.  Trust me.

If you have been looking for a true hole in the wall Mexican restaurant for cheap tasty authentic Mexican cuisine, this is your place.  I must have driven by Juan's a thousand times on my way to work without ever noticing it.  It is a totally non-descript cinder block building with no windows or obvious entrances.  It's a little scary looking, especially since it is right next to the 51.  Trust me.  You need to check it out.  Inside is a bustling family run restaurant that feels like home.  The food is really good.  I have already been back several times since being introduced to Juan's by a friend.  It is destined to become a part of my restaurant rotation.

It had been a while since I've been to Cherry Blossom, so I didn't feel good about reviewing it until I tried it again recently.  It was just as good as I remembered.  The service is a tad slow and it is pretty smoky inside, so you run the risk of smelling like garlic and wok oil all day if you eat in.  But take out is always an option.    I had a noodle soup with "mountain vegetables" and fatty udon noodles.  Mountain vegetables?  WTF?  The server didn't even know what the were but they tasted good.    Two thumbs up.

Hello.  My name is Sarah.  I am back from the dead.  Where do I begin...  well, ventured into Karsh's on a Sunday after a hard night of drinking.  I was greeted by such a friendly guy.  He gave me all kinds of samples.  I can't really give a fair review of the pastries because apparently I was there on the wrong day.  However, I do give them props for the friendly service.  Further, they make pretty damn good cakes.  I work at a large office -- we have weekly (and in some months  it seems daily) birthday fantasias complete with a breakfast buffet table and cake with singing in the afternoon.  In the course of 3 years, I must have sampled hundreds of birthday cakes, and honestly, the only one that was good enough to prompt further inquiry was from Karsh's.  Awesome cake.  I will have to go back to try the black and white.

I have struggled to find properly fitting running shoes for years.  Runner's Den cracked the code.  These people know shoes and carry a wide range of sizes, including narrows, in all the best running shoe brand.  Asics, Brooks, New Balance, Adidas, Saucony...  and much much more.  They also carry a nice selection of clothing and running accessories.  The sales people are full of good information or training and clubs if you are new to the sport.  Very warm and friendly, I much prefer this store to that other place in Scottsdale.

Bah!  Below is my outdated review.  I hate Danny's. Do not come here.  I got my oil changed and they forgot to put a plate back on the bottom of my car.  I found out when I brought my car into the dealer for a repair.  They were like, uh, do you know part of your car is missing....  my friend also had a bad experience.  Over $200 for a crappy detail job.  Don't bother.   What to say about Danny's...    It's a full service joint.  You can have your car washed, oil changed, tank filled all while relaxing in an air conditioned sitting area.  The prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy.    I'm still looking for a cheap place to get my car washed, but I do bring my car to Danny's for oil changes.

A favorite for dinner.  Scores with the trifecta of great food, good service, and killer ambiance.  Dark and romantic.  Really good moody alternative music playing in the background.  Comfy booths that make you want to linger over dinner for hours.  I guess the story is that it is supposed to resemble the smokehouses of the Netherlands?  I can't comment about that because I have never been to the Netherlands, but I love the vibe here.   Upscale.  American/New American food.  Meat intensive, so don't bring your vegetarian date here.  Don't over-order, the portions are quite big.  That's it.  Go.

What else is there to say about the Merc Bar?  It's an old standard.  I have been coming here for years...  at one time it was the only answer to "I'm in a lounge kind of mood".  There are definitely more options in the bar category these days, but that won't stop me from coming from the Merc.  It doesn't hurt that it is close to where I live...  and it is so pleasantly dark.  Not just dimly lit.  Dark.  And randomly located.  As you walk out of the parking garage through a swarm of high schoolers headed to the Harkins, you have that moment of WTF?  And then you enter the Merc.  I quite enjoy the contrast.  Plus, a doorman there once paid me a really nice compliment.  Ever since, I get warm fuzzies walking through the front door of Merc.  Ah, the power of positive associations.

Terrible coffee.  So bitter I would have to dump a quarter cup of cream and several heaping tablespoons of sugar into this cup-a-joe to overpower the flavor...  but at that point, why wouldn't I go all out and find myself a milkshake or some other creamy sugary treat?      The muffins are the size of your head.  Lots of calorie-laden treats.  I had some carrot cake once and it had that stale refrigerator flavor in the icing.  What a waste.     My advice, walk across the street to Starbucks. At least you'll get a mediocre cup of coffee instead of a bad one.

A true French cafe serving authentic French fare hidden in a cluster of tall office buildings.  Look no farther for pastries, croissants, a nicoise salad...  seriously the best chocolate croissant I have had anywhere in Phoenix.

People seem to really like Sam's, though I am not quite sure why.  I think it is average.  Not great, not bad, just middle of the road food with a Southwestern twist.  Kind of like the Cheesecake Factory.  The food tastes good, but anything meal tastes good if it is loaded with fat.

UPDATE 2/8/06    Well, I had to take a star off because the Spanish Latte at LGO (Le Grande Orange) seriously kicks ass.  I hate to say it, but Hava Java just can't hold a candle to it.  But I still really like Hava Java for coffee and it is a nice place to sit.  It also had the bonus of being connected to a genuine gelatoria.      ++++++++++++++    The best coffee I have had in Phoenix.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars in the greater coffee universe, but it is way better than what you will find at Starbucks or Coffee Plantation (which hardly qualifies as coffee in my book).  Until I find better in Phoenix/Scottsdale I will let the rating stand.  Bonus points for being connected to a gelato shop.  Baked goods/pasteries are average.  Pleasant atmosphere.

Yeah, not so good, and I have given this place several chances.  The sandwiches are overstuffed, kind of sloppy and made with sub-standard quality ingredients.  I would actually rather get a sandwich from subway.  And it it way too loud to sit inside this place.  I wish it was better then it is because I can literally walk here from my house.  The salads are pretty good.  I'll give them that.

UPDATE:  12/30/06  The love affair is waning.  LGO has become overrun by pretentious annoying people accompanied by small children and little dogs.  Parking is a real problem.  I have gotten one too many plates of cold eggs.   And there seem be training issue going on at the coffee bar.  I have gotten several bad Spanish Lattes.  Very disappointing.  The counter service is also lacking - a lot of the new people working here just don't seem to care.  Ah, how I long for the good old days.  The prices here aren't exactly cheap.   I'm not sure this place is worth the bother anymore.  LGO, you are officially on probation.  UPDATE:  2/9/06  Okay, I love this place.  The Spanish Latte kicks ass.  And recent renovations have improved traffic flow.  It is still really busy, but understandably so.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++  I want to like this place more then I do.  It has really great fresh light food.  I love the breakfast and lunch choices.  It has a definite European touch.   I love the atmosphere.  It is just too darn small and busy. There is no where to sit and no where to park.  And if you are not a "regular" you don't always feel welcomed.  The concept and food gets 5 stars, but the hassle and spotty service brings it down to 3.  Nevertheless, I'm a sucker for this neighborhood hangout and I'm sure I'll be back.

I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves "light fare."  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!

This is where I go to get my car washed.  They do a good job, it's never a long wait and the prices are good.  The guys are always super nice to me.  Every time I've gone, I've gotten some kind of random discount.  I agree with the other reviewers.  Way better than Danny's.

Dry cleaners are like hair stylists - you are entrusting them with something very personal and important.  I usually test-drive a cleaner for several months before I will entrust one with an important item.  So far, this cleaner has been great.  I have been using it for the past 9 months with no incident .  The prices are surprisingly good for this part of town.  I am holding back one star because of its hours.  Very inconvenient if you have to work for a living.  They don't open until 7 am and close at 6:30!  They are open Saturday, but only until 3 pm.  And closed on Sunday.  Luckily, I live nearby, so can stop on my way to work.  Anyway.  These guys are good.

Thai Lahna is destined to become my answer to "I'm hungry, I'm tired, and I'm afraid to open the fridge because I know it is full of take-out boxes dating back to August '07."  You think I'm joking.  I wish I was.  But I digress.  TL is that DL (as in "down-low") kind of place where you can just sit and decompress over a warm plate of food at the end of the day.  The hot tea is good.  Make sure to try it.  As for food...  I can only talk in generalities because unfamiliar foreign words I can't pronounce just don't stick in my brain.  So, here we go, the spicy soup made with the coconut broth is fantastic.  And the curry dishes are very good as well.  I've tried something described as being made with a "light gravy".  I don't recommend that.  The menu is overwhelmingly large, so it's going to take me a while to work through it.  I will report back my fave at some undetermined point in the future.

I really like this vet clinic. I've tried a few others in the area and Blue Cross is by far the standout.  The facility looks very new to me and is impeccably clean.  It has separate entrances and waiting areas for cats and dogs to minimize the trauma, which is a nice touch.  I have found the vets here to be extremely responsive and kind.  And they put up with my maniac cat that just HATES going to the vet.  You've seen cartoons of the Tasmanian Devil, right?  That's my cat at any vet clinic.

Woohoo Sassy Glasses!!!  Fellow four-eyes, you must stop by to try on some new specs.  You will find the store stocked with a wide variety of fashion forward frames from all over the world.  I fell in love with some old school classic tortoise shell frames by Kio Yamato and modern black angular frames by prodesign denmark, so I got both!  I couldn't stop myself.   My search for new glasses has a back-story.  About 5 months ago, my puppy ate my glasses.  I was upset, but not too upset because I wasn't in love with the frames.  So, I went to the fancy store at the Waterfront by the Fashion Square - Optika - to buy the glasses I had been dreaming of...  black Chanel rectangular frames with bicolor arms.  Those glasses were bucks, but I loved them.  I got compliments on a weekly basis, usually from guys.   Then one day, just months after I got them, the puppy managed to sneak them off the counter while I was talking on the phone.  I was horrified to find the mangled frames hanging out of his mouth when I heard a loud "crunch, crunch, crunch."  I cried.  Real tears.  I am not exaggerating.  After recovering from the trauma, I went back to Optika, but could not find the beloved Chanels.  They were "last season" and no longer in stock.  I tried on a variety of frames from all the big names...  but nothing spoke to me.  Then I remembered my friend Yelp.  I asked Yelp, where do I find "cool glasses."  Up popped Nathan S. and Sarabear B. , both touting the great selection of unique frames at Sassy Glasses.   I raced to the store to find a FANTASTIC selection of unique glasses in a modern boutique-style shop ran by a very cool husband and wife pair.  I had a great time trying on frames and fell in love with about 5 pairs.  The best part?  I walked away with 2 pairs of glasses that I love for about the same price I paid for the Chanels.  Thank you Yelp!

*Disclaimer* It has been many many years since I've been here but...  Very romantic.  The restaurant is at the very top of a butte with a stellar view of the city.  The city lights look like a blanket of stars from this vantage point at night.  White glove service.  Continental cuisine.  The food is good, but it is the location and overall setting that makes this place very special.  Take your honey here for Valentines day.  She won't be dissapointed.

I shop here every weekend.  Even though I feel as though Whole Foods has lost some of its original spunk since turning into a giant national chain it is still better than anyplace else to shop.  You will always find a nice selection of organic foods and groceries.  Nice wine and cheese selection.  Great prepared foods.  And they give you complimentary ice so your food doesn't spoil during the drive home before the A/C kicks in.

Come one come all... the holy grail of burritos.  Try tomatoes, potatoes and rice.  Find a spot to park next to the Hummer, the cop car, the fire truck, the Mercedes, and the VW bus, order your 10 lb burrito (which will cost you about the same as a double tall vanilla latte) and pop a squat at one of the picnic tables.  Worthy of a pilgrimage.

A favorite spot for lunch on the weekends.  You order up your food in a little farmhouse.  Pick from a selection of farm fresh sandwiches, salads, soups, and fresh baked goods.  Everything is very good.  Then grab a picnic table in the pecan grove and enjoy the fresh air, Arizona sunshine, and serene view of South Mountain stretching before you.  This is a great place to take the whole family.  The kids can run around and play while you enjoy a meal out.  A perfect day in the country without having to leave the city.

This is my favorite yoga studio of the Valley.  Worth the drive down to Chandler.  Not at all trendy.  The teachers here are fantastic and down to earth.  The prices are reasonable.  I prefer the atmosphere of this studio to At One.  I feel the classes at Inner Vision are much more connected to what yoga is all about.  All the teachers are great, but Kat is my favorite.

This is not good Asian food.  The veggie stir fry was terrible.  The rice was deplorable.  The hot and sour soup was very good - a bright spot on the menu.  If I was ever forced to come here again, I would order that.  Otherwise, this is genericized Asia food that is no better than the take out you could get at any mall in any state in the U.S.  And, the service was slow.  Not terrible.  Just kind of absent.

You can find a lot of the fashion forward denim brands that are really hard to find at this store.  However, I really cannot get past the attitude of the sales people.  I have been in this store several times and always walk out a few minutes later feeling like a geeky physics club kid who is trying to crash the coolest party in town.  But if absolutely must deck yourself in rhinestones for a Paris Hilton look-alike contest, this is the place to come.

Expensive.  That about sums it up.  You will not find Cheetos here.  A whole grocery store of the finest foods and household items money can by.  It's like a boutique Trader Joes.  The best produce, meats, teas, jams, honey, chips, and on and on that you will find in the Valley.  It also has an excellent deli, prepared meals, a sushi bar, cakes and candies...  good stuff.  But like I said, pricey.

Simply the best health club... maybe in America?  Certainly competes with the best of NYC or LA.  Too pricey for me.  My friend gives me all her guest passes so I can poach the club on occasion.  Tons of great classes, a beautiful space, the most luxurious locker room (more like a spa) that I have ever been in. High tech equipment (the cardio machine have individual little tv screens). Full indoor basketball court.  The club hosts happy hours with free food and discounted wine...  if you take advantage of everything the club has to offer, I think it is well worth the money.  Truly more like a country club for gym people than a gym.

This is one of my favorite cafes for lunch.  It is one of the few places that serves up homemade soups and creative entree salads daily.  Casual and totally reasonable prices.  The fresh bakes goodies are wonderful, as is the selection of ice tea made from high quality local tea company Revolution Tea.

The place to buy a bicycle.  If you tune into the Tour de France, this is your store.  The staff is very knowledgeable and professional.  You can have a custom bike made from scratch or buy something in stock and by they time they get done with a professional bike fitting session, you will feel like it was custom made for you.  I wasted too much time being uncomfortable on a bike.  I finally went in for a bike fit.  All it took was a new seat and a few minor adjustments to completely change my relationship with the bike.

Get the Garden Salad with grilled chicken and the Nello's house dressing.  So simple and good.  It's nothing fancy, I promise.  There is just something about the crunch of the iceberg lettuce, the grated fresh mozzarella, the subtle spice of the chicken and the INCREDIBLE pizza SASE dressing...  oddly satisfying.  This is a total local hangout.  Lots of families.  You can bring the rug-rats here.  Everyone else does.       The pizza is average.  Stick to the salad and bread sticks (basically an entire seasoned cut up pizza crust).

Nicely edited selection of mid to high end electronics.    Knowledgeable and professional staff.  These guys (and gals) know what they are talking about and will go the extra mile in terms of customer service.      Thinking about splurging on a home theater?  Ask for Scott.  He will listen to you and help you build your dream system within your budget.  He will even respond to your hi-fi emergencies (eg. the guests are arriving for your Super Bowl party and you don't remember how to work the mission control style remote).

One of my favorite lunch spots if I am going to sit down and really enjoy lunch.  This is a good spot to take client or have any kind of business lunch.  Elegant modern setting, without being at all stuffy.  The salmon is good.  This is a quality, not quantity kind of place.

I love Pino's.  They have a stuffed veggie calzone thing that is really really tasty and if you are if you are in the mood for something lighter, the salads are actually quite good as well.  It's always super crowded at lunch but people cycle through pretty fast because everyone is in a rush to get back to work (this part of town is lawyer/business-type heavy).  Word of warning - cash only.    I don't have any funny stories about Pino's.  I wish I did.  As I am writing this review I am boring myself.  But what can I say?  It's consistently good and I am usually here with work people so I'm on good behavior.

This place is solid for lunch.  Yes, it is a total hole in the wall, but that is part of the charm!  Right? I went with regulars, who ordered for me, so perhaps the menu may be hit or miss.  What I can tell you is that my meal, what ever it was, was great.  It was a noodle/BBQ pork dish.  And the deep fried spring rolls were fantastic.  And guess what was even better?  My whole meal, which was more than I could eat, was $4.50!  I will be back.

The Great Wall was my first dim sum experience, making me what you might call a tableau rosa*.  Since I know nothing about dim sum, all I can do is share my overall general biased by my own narrow existence perception of the place.  So here it goes.  As usual, Mr. K has accurately described and captured the essence of this restaurant in his review, so there's that.  Read his review.  What I can add is this.  The food all tasted good to me.  The atmosphere was fun and lively.  The demo is certainly nothing like any place I've ever been to in Phoenix, so those who decry the lack of diversity in this town, perhaps you just need to expand your horizons to include Great Wall into your rotation. And I would go back.  I have to get on the HIGHWAY to drive here, so that is saying a lot.  For those of you who are directionally challenged, it's the first shopping plaza on the east side of 35th Avenue, just north of Camelback.      *It's been years and years and years since high school English.  For some reason I think this means "blank slate."  If not strike "tableau rosa" and insert "blank slate" above.

Mickey's rocks.  Open for after-hours.  I have spent many nights here valiantly trying to sober up by downing sweet potato fries, sliders, and other choice hangover treats.  It's totally divey, full of tattered couches, and people having a good old time.  I have a hazy memory of sitting on a couch in a daze watching repeats of old television favorites with a party going on all around me like that scene in Garden State...  good times.

Bargain basement produce.  "Seriously silly prices" is their slogan and they really follow through.  I have to try to spend more than $30 here.  It's like a budget Whole Foods.

I'm not sure I want to share this place...  dark moody lighting, great booths, downtempo beats, and the drink bible.  What more do you need?  The crowd is hit and miss.  Some nights it is totally mellow and other nights it is packed.  But it is always interesting.  Definitely one of my favorite bars in Scottsdale.

It is a gem.  Hidden?  Literally perhaps.  Try finding a place to sit during prime hour, though.  I really do like this place a lot despite the yuppie crowd.  Great wine selection.  Tasty bites.  Very dark.  Couches.  Cool place to spend New Years Eve.  Reserve a table and settle in for the night.

Foodies Alert!  Eat here now!  Not the best dining room but definitely the best food in the Valley and an impressive wine list to boot.  You will be very happy with your meal.  Unique flavor combos.  Super rich.  The menu is mostly meat dishes with southwestern influenced sauces.      My picks? The chopped salad is a must.  The miso spicy squid rocks.  The mushroom pan fry is unbelievable but so rich you should opt for the "mini" portion. And save room for dessert.      (pause)    The cuppa hot chocolate ("cinnamon-spiked chocolate pot de creme with chipotle crema, ancho chile honey, cayenne-spiked ginger cookie") is without a doubt the BEST BEST BEST dessert I have ever had ANYWHERE.  The thought of it tears me up.  Spicy, sweet, creamy goodness.  This is heaven.

"Original"  Take that literally, as in unique, one of a kind.  I love breakfast.  I eat breakfast for dinner sometimes I like it so much.  I can honestly say that I have never been anywhere with so many original pancake recipes.  Fantastic.  Get "the Apple Thing".  Trust me.  This is a local institution.  Good early.  Bring cash.

This is the only place I have had decent Thai food in the Phoenix-metro.  But if you get a hankering for Thai, I can't think of a better place to go.  UPDATE:  Sometimes I forget how good certain places are.  The above review is a rather passionless review.  It had been a while since I had been to Malee's when I wrote it, so I wasn't inspired.  I will update this review when inspiration strikes.

One of the best place to buy denim in Arizona!  The Hub stocks a wide selection of the latest styles, including a lot of European designers.  Come to think of it, the store has a definite Euro vibe that is quite different from the over-the-top girly girl SoCal look that is ubiquitous in Scottsdale.   The store has a equal balance of mens and womens clothing.

My family is from New Mexico.  I grew up on posole, green chilies, carne adovada, sopapillas...  This is the best New Mexico style mexican food I have had in the Valley.  Totally chill environment.  A true hidden gem. I always have to drive by like 3 times because the sign is black and it is tucked behind some vegetation.  Cheap.  Big portions.  My favorite is the carne adovada with red sauce.  It's definitely campy with fake rock walls with stuffed animal bats hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, newspaper menus and a lagoon outside, but that is part of the charm for me.  You don't have to be a fancy person to feel at home here and go ahead, bring the kids.  It's family friendly.

This is my favorite pizza in the Valley.  Make sure to try the white pizza.  I got one bad pizza and we had a work function here that wasn't well organized, but I let that slide because I like the pizza so much.  Nice and thin, charred blistery crust from the coal oven.  I prefer the bar area.  Check it out.

I've sat on this review a long time because Zizzo's is already so busy I didn't want to share.  But that's not nice.  Everyone needs a good tailor and they are so hard to find.  So, I give you all Zizzo's. This is THE place.  Phil is both hilarious and brilliant at fitting. In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to admit that he is my neighbor.  But that in no way has influenced my review.  If you don't believe me, ask Neiman Marcus.  They send stuff out to Zizzo's.

My all time favorite spot.  Best sunset in the Valley.  Steller views and decor.  Amazing martinis.  Excellent food.  I don't usually order seafood in the desert but the scallops here were amazing.  When I ate here in May I saw Mario Batali leaving!  I call this place the vortex.  It is so serene you never want to leave.      The spa/resort (the Sanctuary on Camelback) also happens to be my all-time favorite resort.  I wish I could live here.  Too bad it is sooooo expensive.  Go during off season.      The Jade Bar is one of my favorite bars.  The killer martinis are served in bucket-sized glasses and strange things are always afoot...  very entertaining.

The land of "yes."  Make any request and it will be done.  Killer infinity pool.  Amazing view.  Lovely rooms.  One of my all time favorite hotels.  Expensive.  Go during off season.    Update:  Hmmm... seems to be turning into quite the celebrity hideaway.  The bartender used to tell me about Britney's stays.  And I did see chef Mario Batali leaving one night.  But most recently Vince and Jennifer were guests.

If we are within a 30-mile radius, even for a few days, my husband get cleaning done here.  It's kind of ridiculous.  But they do a great job.  The prices are a little high, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I trust them with my cloths.  That is saying a lot.  I have tried other cleaners in the area and have regretted it as I cried over ruined items.

I have seen Four Peaks grow from a small bar to a full on restaurant over the years.  Good beer.  Good food.  Reasonable prices.  What more can you ask for?  I reserved one star because it has lost a little something over the years for me...  I liked it more when it was a small college hangout.  I like the Tempe original way more than its Scottsdale sister, which blows.  Stick to the original.

I really hate this branch of Pita Jungle.  I think this is due to the college-age hippie stoner slackers that dominate the staff.  I eat at the Pita Jungle in Scottsdale often and love it - worthy of at least 4 stars.  The Tempe branch - yikes.  Bad bad sloooooooooooooooooooow service. Maybe I am being overly harsh but my last experience here was so bad I actually walked out of the restaurant without eating my meal or paying.  After sitting there for over an hour, they managed to serve me the same cold plate of food twice (it was supposed to be hot).  And it wasn't  even that fact that I got served cold food twice that really ticked me off.  It was that no one there - not even the manager - seemed to give a shit.  Unacceptable.

Very good Israeli restaurant right down the street from ASU.  It is a casual family-run place where you will find the usual suspects of Middle Eastern fare.  Excellent, cheap, and very large chicken shawarma sandwiches.  The combo plate is also noteworthy.  Really good falafel and I love their hummus.  The lentil soup is also stellar.  This is a no-brainer for lunch if you are in Tempe.  The service is fast and friendly.

Probably one of the most romantic restaurants in the entire Valley is tucked away in Tempe right down the street from ASU.  I have had countless lunches and dinners here.  The restaurant is a little cottage tucked behind some trees with a gorgeous patio complete with outdoor fireplace, bar, and twinkling lights in the trees.  You can sit inside the cottage or outside under the canopy of trees. Eclectic and sophisticated menu...  might be considered Cal-French?  Great food/wine pairings.  Lovely service.  Perfect for a romantic meal or a nightcap at the outdoor bar.  Great for dinner parties as well.  Small enough to book the entire place for a wedding reception.

It's a dive but I swear this is the best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever had.  We used to come here a couple times of week when I was in college.  The BBQ sauce is to die for.  And it is so cheap.

My favorite bar in Tempe.  Chill patio scene.  Grab a pint and a table outdoors.  Due to its proximity to ASU it tends to attract a college crowd but there is a good mix of ages most of the time.  You can wear your grungies and not feel out of place, which is always a plus.  If you like uppity Scottsdale bars you might consider this a "dive" even though it's not.

The emperor has no clothes.  There.  I said it.  I had one the top 5 WORST dining experiences of my life eating at Durant's.  The food was average.  I had scallops that were slightly overcooked, poorly seasoned and somewhat gritty.  I tasted my fellow dining mates steaks and they were well below average compared to other steaks in this cost bracket (Flemings, Ruths Chris, Capital Grill).  And at $30 an entree I expect my food to be served without a side of attitude.  The service wasn't bad, it was offensive.  Our server was rude, sarcastic, flippant, and completely disrespectful. My husband actually got up halfway through the dinner to pull him aside and alert him that we were not happy with the service and to give him a chance to step it up.  We were quite polite and discrete about it.  The server proceeded to come back to the table and make jokes about this and announced sarcastically to the table that "he heard we were in a rush to get somewhere" and he was going to speed things up.  Um.  Wrong.  We weren't in a rush.  All we wanted was to enjoy our dinner.  It was bad enough I brought my parents to this place.  But I would have been truly mortified if I had brought a client here.  I will never go back.    If you have read my reviews, you know I am not prone to writing harsh reviews unless it is totally deserved. This one is.  Durants seems to be one of those old school restaurants that is skating by on its history and once-deserved reputation.  My advice?  Don't bother.  I can think of at least 5 other steak houses in the Valley where you will get a better meal for about the same or less money with far better service.  Lets review:  expensive mediocre food, horrible service, loud chaotic atmosphere...  really?  Your still going to give it a try?  Okay, don't say I didn't warn you.

Habitat of the rare Phoenix-hipster.  The coffee drinks are better than any other coffee shop I have found in Phoenix.  Not as good as SF or Portland...  but still pretty good.  Hipster scene aside, this is actually a very pleasant place to hang out.  It is a true coffee house.  Props for the Adler vase on the counter and mod decor.  If I am in the mood to drink coffee and catch up on some reading I will definitely come here.

Really fun atmosphere.  Good music.  Dark and intimate.  Large private booths are perfect for chillin' with a group of friends.  The food is heavy and the portions are very very large.  I am not in love with the fish dishes.  But the meat dishes are really tasty - I had the most fantastic pork tenderloin here...  this is a nice place to take out-of-towners for a casual upscale meal with local flavor and atmosphere.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I would like to add there I don't consider much of the menu to be true "cuisine of New Mexico".  I am from New Mexico, so I know what I am talking about. (fyi - Carlsbad Tavern in South Scottsdale is the most authentic New Mexico cuisine I have had in the Valley).  As Omer notes, it is smoky and the food is hit or miss.  I came here for lunch and was not at all impressed.  However, I was won over when I came here for dinner with a group of friends.  This is a fun place at night and several dishes are quite good.

Come here for New Mexico style Mexican cuisine.  Think hot hot hot.  Red or green.  Pick your poison.  The rellenos are great.  I have no idea what WM is talking about - as far as I know there is only one other Los Dos is the Phoenix area.  And overpriced?  Did we go to the same restaurant?

Ah, back in the day this used to be THE place to go.  Went back this summer at it was so over.  The bar scene was lame.  The rooms were loud.  The pool was overrun with the worst element of Scottsdale.  I hear they are totally renovating the place... or already have?  I won't be stopping by to find out.

I love this mall. You need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside! It is one of the only indoor malls that I like. I feel so calm when I am here. You can find just about anything in this mall.  The food court is pretty good.  I like Paradise Cafe for sandwiches.  There are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well.  Plenty of parking or you can just valet.  My favorite Nordstroms is here.  I find the Nordies in SF to be too big and overwhelming.  The one at the Fashion Square is minimalist, well organized, and edited to suit my tastes.

The Phoenix metro is all about hidden gems.  Anyone who hates the Valley because "it has no character, everything is a chain" just doesn't know where to go.  Los Sombreros is a prime example of this.      I have known about this place for a while but have never stopped in because, well, it doesn't have much curbside appeal as you roar by on Scottsdale Road in the XXX zone.   Shame on me.  I went this weekend and walking in the back was like being transported to a friendly cantina in Mexico.  The ambiance, service, and food were all delightful.  This is authentic/gourmet type dishes in a casual setting that includes an outdoor patio and bar.  The scale of the whole place is small and intimate.  I had seafood crepes in some kind of avocado sauce.  The plates around me looked equally delightful, from the traditional mole to the carnitas to the mango crab salad.  The pepitas crusted snapper is next on my list to try.   I'll be back again... soon.

The burger is worth 5 stars but I can't get behind the whole package.  The menu is a la carte... order a burger, a salad, and a few drinks and you will be staring at a bill that can't possibly seem right.  Really really loud and trendy -- the wait can be fierce at peak hours.  The chicken sandwich is not good.  The salads are above average for Phoenix.  I would only come here for a burger, if at all.    Don't get me wrong.  The food is super high quality.  Organic beef and produce are used.  The sweet potato fries are out of this world.  The decor is very stylish.  It's a fun place.  It you like loud busy bustling spots you'll love Delux.  Update:  Okay.  I find that I do actually come here on a regular basis.  I discovered the veggie panini and it is fantastic.  I also love the beet salad.  And who can resist the fries.

Update:  I went back for dinner and was equally impressed.  I had fish with some sort of sweet glaze and sauteed mushrooms.  It was out of this world.  Really really good.  I splurged and went for dessert as well.  Oh my god, everything was perfect.  Service was excellent.  Fox hit this one out of the park.      ------------------------    I had the most fantastic lunch at Green House, which just opened a few weeks ago in the Kierland Commons outdoor shopping plaza.  Oh so California, from the wine list and Cow Girl Creamery cheeses, to the fresh seasonal dishes gracing the menu.  Elegant modern casual breezy restaurant that really feels like it was plucked right out of the Bay Area.  The decor seemed one part California craftsman and one part Frank Lloyd Wright.     I totally splurged and had the Kobe beef burgers since I was dining solo.  Yes, the plural is not a typo.  The presentation is two mini burgers, aka sliders, with a square dish full of fries.  I opted for a salad of tossed greens instead of fries to assuage my guilt.  I washed it all down with not one but two delightful glasses of red.      I chatted up a mystery stranger at the bar, imparting some shopping advice (he was looking for that perfect Valentine gift for his lady), and he quite chivalrously paid for my lunch!!  Hip hip hooray for random acts of kindness.  The bartenders were super nice.  Overall, one of my top lunches ever.

Sweat dripping gasping for air about to pass out muscle burning torture that will have you looking like a Million Dollar Baby with a mere 1.5 hours of training a week.   This is an old school boxing gym.  One-on-one training.  You will be jumping rope, doing push-ups, pounding the heavy bag, and learning how to float like a butterfly.  If you are pressed for time you will not find a better workout because you are basically in the red for the entire 30 minute workout doing intervals (or "rounds").  The trainers are excellent and the environment is non-threatening.  It will put a spring in your step and get you motivated to exercise if you are in need of some extra inspiration.  You will never get bored.  I guarantee it.  You are learning a new sport, which is so much more fun than pushing weights up and down.    Recently, the owner, Joe, started a Sunday group class called "Shock Zone".  It is aptly named.  Pure torture.  I liken it to Navy Seal training.  Now that the weather has cooled off, we meet at Mesa Community College's playing fields.  Ugh.  Torture.  I already said that.  But I keep going back.  Somehow, Joe makes it fun.

This is a great place to run if you live in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  The very canals that provide water to the metropolis are bordered by excellent hard packed multiuse dirt paths that are perfect for logging serious miles on foot or bike.  The various marathon training clubs run the canals.  Not terribly scenic but flat, safe from traffic and well traveled.  If you go to the SRP website you can calculate the distance of your run with their handy map.

I love hiking up Camelback. So do a lot of other people.  You will not be communing with nature.  However, you will be rewarded with a killer birds-eye view of the city and a tighter ass.  The crowds make for good people watching.   For example... One time I saw an old dude hiking behind his very junior, hmmm.. wife? girlfriend? mistress?  who was wearing a full on gold string bikini, hiking boots, and nothing else.  Their well-oiled tan skin glistened in the sun.  Let's just say that the bikini was not doing a very good job at managing the "girls." Parents were shielding their children's eyes.        Finding a parking spot can be painful.  I used to live close enough to the Cholla trail-head to jog over, hike to the top, and jog home.  If I had to drive there, I certainly would not go on the weekend.      Warnings:      1) If you park somewhere you aren't supposed to you WILL get a ticket, or even worse, the dreaded boot.  This is a ritzy hood and the neighbors have the parking gestapo on point.     2) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING WATER WITH YOU!!!  It is deceptively hard and exposed and dry.  Bring at least a liter with you.  I can't tell you how many times I have seen someone airlifted off the trail after they go into shock from dehydration.

A Scottsdale favorite.  This is a great little sushi bar even though it is out in the boonies of northeast Scottsdale.  Small, breezy, casual but stylish, and fun.  They really did manage to blend a sushi and martini bar pretty seamlessly.  It can be a little bit of a scene and it is definitely an older well-heeled crowd due to its proximity to DC Ranch.      The food is great.  Very creative sushi rolls.  If you are a purist, you will HATE IT.  I am a fan of good food, so I LOVE IT. One example:    Where's the Beef Tempura roll with seared beef tenderloin, asparagus, avocado and shrimp, lightly fried and drizzled with a sweet soy glaze. And the martinis are smashing.      TIP:  I went on a Sunday last summer and they gave us a big discount because I was wearing blue.  It was 50% off, I think.  I hope they do this every summer...

I had such a fantastic time at Cibo.  The pizza is super and the ambiance is charming AND it won't break the bank.  Wood-fired gourmet type pizzas.  Get the antipasto plate!  Salads are good.  I will warn you that the wait for a big group may be epic during prime time.  The venue is a tiny cottage in an unlikely part of downtown Phoenix.   Really cute and fun.  I'll be back.

Words cannot describe this food.  It is a true delight to dine here.  Authentic upscale Mexican food.  You will not find chips and salsa here.  You will find amazing shrimp dishes, an array of freshly prepared salsas and watermelon juice.  Cozy, colorful, and wonderfully unique.  Lunch is a total bargain.  Dining is a little pricey but totally worth it.

Part of the growing empire of those who brought us LGO and Postino...  quite good.  Upscale casual.  American favorites like roasted chicken, burgers, fish tacos...  the ceviche is not so good.  Don't go there.  Overall, I enjoy this place.  I probably eat here once every 6 weeks and have always had a good meal.  It is a good place to bring parents and your relatives from the midwest -- it's a nice local place with a neighborhood feel, but the food is non-threatening.  Everyone is going to find something they like here.  FYI, the key lime pie is super good.

Perfect if you are craving a home-style breakfast.  I had a wonderful mushroom scramble, sausage, and the walnut raisin toast.  The portions were big and the food was very good - quality ingredients.  My only gripe is the orange juice.  It was $2.50 for a shot glass size cup of orange juice and it was half pulp.

Every time I've come here, it's been a blast.  Update:  Last night I needed a cab.  I am all stressed about this because my mobile is dead.  No worries.  They have a button that you push to get a cab, that's right, a BUTTON.  I swear it's true.

Wow.  A place where I can go with my whole family with no complaints!  Even though the menu has many items that qualify as "comfort food", all of the dishes have a modern twist.  The menu has some old standards like meatloaf and pot pie, but you'll also find dishes like seared ahi tuna salad and some wonderful small plates.  While not the most focused menu, it has a lot of options that are all executed very well, making it the perfect place to bring people you don't know or people you do know who do not share you're taste in food.  It's a crowd pleaser.   Service was great.  No complaints.  Reservations recommended.

This is a delightful little place for a glass of wine and bite to eat after work.  I finally stopped last Friday and was charmed.  Lisa G herself poured my glass and chatted me up.  I enjoyed some dessert.  It was quite good.    Lunch is also excellent.  Great salads and sandwiches made with MJ Bread.  A tad spendy. Salads and sandwiches come in around $9 and the special is $12.   I would eat here all the time, but I just got back from lunch for two and the bill was $40 (including tip but NOT wine).  Ouch.

The nesting phase.  A period of time in which you become more interested in the thread count of sheets than the lastest denim brand to hit the market.  Yes.  I am there.  And I have found my ultimate home store.  Haus has opened a new big airy store in Scottsdale and I absolutely love everything in it.  Dwell and Area linens.  Angela Adams rugs.  Mid-century modern decor.  Ultra hip (and comfortable) furniture.  I don't know enough about home decor to drop many names.  Just take my word for it.  If you like modern design, this is the store for you.

Shady's is the polar opposite of the kind of bars you will find in Scottsdale.   It's dark.  It's small.  It has no theme, no slick decor. It's kind of like the basement of your parents' house, complete with random furniture.  There is a porch for smokers. There are pool tables and a rotating Budweiser sign.  I recognize that some people will probably hate Shady's.  It is a dive bar and its lack of both polish and cache effectively filters out the typical Scottsdale bar crowd AND the Phoenix hipsters.  In other words, the crowd is generally low-key, friendly and non-pretentious.   Works for me.

I love movies.  It kills me that we live in the 6th largest city in the U.S. and have 1 theater that shows independent films.  Minus one star because the theater is in serious need of an face-lift.  However, it consistently screens a nice selection of independent films.  You'll find me there at a Sunday matinee.

I really like this coffee shop.  Pros:  Natural light (practically sunny inside), super clean (even the bathroom), decent coffee, open and airy, couches, clever design (converted gas station).  Cons:  Located 3 blocks from my ex-boyfriend's house.  Since I live on the other side of town, I cannot come here ever again.  If I run into him, he will think that I am stalking him.  I'm not taking this well (the loss of Copper Star).

Healthy food. Open for breakfast/lunch/and dinner.  I often stop here for a quick dinner when I am too lazy to cook .  The menu includes salads, sandwiches, flatbread pizzas, rice bowls, etc.  The menu actually lists the nutritional content of each menu item.  You will see a lot of sweaty people in running shorts and tank tops here.  Oh yeah, it's good and pretty cheap.  The turkey burger (served with a side of cucumber salad) is excellent.  Their homemade granola is pretty damn good too.  Note - the menu is hit or miss here.  The vegetarian options are all quite good, as is the salmon.  But the chicken tends to be dry and chewy - not good. I always get the grilled veggie wrap.  It's fantastic.

Being a long time devotee of the Gelato Spot, I never gave this place a shot.  I must admit, the Marscapone gelato was very good.   I probably won't switch from Gelato Spot because parking is so much more convenient at 32nd & Camelback.  However, the next time I am out for a walk in the area or am in the mood for a sweet treat after dinner at Postino or LGO, I will definitely pop in.

If you are into Modernism, you have to check this place out.   The owner is super friendly and very knowable about modern furniture.  You can buy real deal vintage stuff here.  The store is small but inventory is constantly on the move.  I would like to decorate my whole house with stuff from this store.

This is one of my favorite music venues in the Valley.  It's an outdoor grass venue that is big enough to get good bands but small enough to feel intimate.  It's all open so you can get right up there next to the stage.  I saw Modest Mouse here last year and am looking forward to seeing Death Cab for Cutie this December.  Keep your eye on the concert schedule.

**NOW OPEN FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH**  8 am -  3 pm   This is a true neighborhood cafe with fresh food at neighbor-friendly prices.  Acacia Cafe just opened and I couldn't be happier.  It is easy to miss, sandwiched between an Italian restaurant and a retail plaza.  I stopped in the morning and was delighted to find a clean space with a great breakfast and lunch menu that is much more extensive then their website suggests.  For breakfast, they have several breakfast sandwiches, omelettes, and scrambles, a yogurt parfait, and an array of baked goods.  For lunch, they have about 5 different salads, 5 different sandwiches, and fresh made soup.    The counter person was super friendly as was proud to gush about the quality of the ingredients they use and that everything was made fresh including their baked goods (which includes cookies, rice crispy bars, scones, breads, croissants...).    I had a croissant and it was fantastic.  Seriously, the best I have had anywhere in Phoenix.   If all this doesn't sell you, the prices will.  Breakfast items (including the breakfast entrees, like the veggie scramble, which all include a breakfast bread of your choice) were under $4 and lunch items were under $6!   My killer croissant was $1.50.  I guess you can keep prices low when you make everything in house.  They open super early 5 AM - 3 PM during the week, and a little later on the weekends.  (open Sat., closed Sun.), so you can pop in after an early morning spin session at Studio 360.   And parking is plentiful.  Let's review.  Cheap, tasty, and convenient.  It's the trifecta. FINALLY, an alternative to the mob scene that was once my favorite neighborhood spot (aka LGO).

I'm not breaking any new ground by reviewing Piestewa Peak.  But for those of you out there who are new to the Phoenix area or are just visiting, well, maybe you haven't heard of Piestewa...  My nickname for this hunk of metamorphic rock is "the StairMaster" because I primarily travel the summit trail, and well, it's a big giant natural StairMaster.  Every step is is step up.  Literally.  Your buns will be burning by the time you get to the top.  And your prize is the view from the top - a 360 degree uninterrupted view of the Valley.  The best part?  It's in our backyard.  How great is that?!  Name another major city the size of Phoenix where you can drive 10 minutes to a trail head... okay, there are probably a few... but that doesn't diminish my appreciation of the fact that I can be on the trail with such a minimal time investment.    For those of you who have hiked this route and are turned off by the crowds, I offer you an alternative.  Hike at night.  In the dark.  Yep. You heard me.  This is the way to do it.  Not only are you guaranteed much more pleasant temperatures, you are also guaranteed a moment of solitude.  It is quiet, lovely and largely untraveled during the darker hours.  Wait.  I didn't just say that.  It's dangerous and stupid to hike at night.  Don't do it.  I'm warning you. Your run the risk of stepping on a rattlesnake, getting bitten by a rabid ringtail or walking of a dangerous precipice and breaking your neck.   I hereby disclaim all liability (I had to throw that disclaimer in there, I'm a lawyer).  That being said, I enjoy hiking at night.  The city lights are spectacular.   If you decide to live dangerously, make sure you bring a headlamp, some water, hiking poles, and a friend or two.

I liked the original terry track suits, but those are like, so 5 years ago.  Besides, the girls sold out (and who can blame them) to Liz Claiborn or some other mass producer.  These clothes are probably made in China now.  No thanks.

I love love love this place.  Its kind of an epic journey from midtown with all the construction going on downtown right now.  But, on those rare days that I can justify a 90+ minute lunch, this is in the top five.  Fancy sandwiches and salads.  Sinful desserts.  And an art gallery.

Holy sh*t!   *#!@!!*#???  F**K !!!! Sorry, I'm not prone to using profanity, but that's how upset I am that today was my first visit to Stinkweeds.  I have wasted countless hours surfing iTunes listening to 20 second clips of music, when I simply needed to walk into Stinkweeds and say, "Hi, tell me about some cool music."  I am completely outsourcing my music shopping to the staff of this store.  Let me tell you about my first time.  I walked in the door. I am sure I looked disoriented.  I had not been inside a true record store in years.  The fact that the shelves were filled with an overwhelmingly large number of albums with unrecognizable band names amplified my disorientation.  A member of the staff approached me. "Do you need help?"  I hesitated, thinking to myself, I am so not cool,  I am about to be exposed.  I must have nodded in the affirmative because he quickly followed up with  "What kind of music do you like?"  This is the most perilous question to be asked by a record store guy. Visions of High Fidelity flashing through my mind, I mumbled, "Uh, I don't know."   "Yes, you do.  Tell me."  I managed to rattle off the names of a few non-mainstream bands that I actually really love.  I waited for a respond.  "Cool.  Let me play you something."  He proceeded to switch the music being played in the store to his pick for me.  Within minutes I was sold.  We repeated this process until I had selected 3 absolutely amazing albums that I would have never found on my own.  After wandering around the store for a while on my own, admiring the wide selection of stellar music, I decided it was time to pay and get on with my day.  Record store guy paused a moment before ringing up my purchase.  "Wait a second, I think we have used copies of all 3 of these albums. I'm going to save you some money."  Sure enough, after some searching, he returned with the promised goods.  Total price for 3 amazingly good albums?  $24 including tax.  I'm hooked.  Awesome music selection, friendly non-threatening staff (yes, I know that's redundant), lots of used CDs...  you know where to find me next weekend.

This store sells handmade letterpress cards.  And not that boring shit you find at Papyrus or Cranes.  The selection may be limited, but where else are you going to find a card that says "I really do hate you."  (I am being literal.  That was on the front of a card.) Enough about the cards.  It's actually not a card shop.  I would classify it as a gift shop. The items offered for sale include, without limitation, the following:   what appeared to be the entire Free People clothing line, candles, jewelry, baby clothing and other baby shower gifts, and pajamas.  Definitely random.  But in a good way I think.  And who cares.  They sell letterpress.  I'm going back for that card.  I can think of a few people that I want to give that one to.  Oh, did I just say that?  Kidding (no I'm not).

This is a special shout out to fellow Wildcats... Bison Witches has arrived, or at least, I just discovered it in the Phoenix metro!  While the Tempe branch lacks the special homey ambiance of the Tucson original, this will do.  The food is the same.  The prices are the same.  And the friendly laid back service is the same.  Whoops.  I forgot that I am writing for a wider audience.  For those of you who aren't in the know, Bison Witches is a laid back pub style restaurant that specializes in sandwiches, bread bowl soups and of course, beer.  Be warned, these are not fancy pants yuppie sandwiches like you might at LGO, but they are every bit as good in their own way.  I'm talking about ham and cheese on toasted Texas Toast, PB&J, and my favorite, the "Miss Priss" (turkey, cheddar, sprouts, and avocado).  If you are looking for a laid back venue for a cheap bite, you can't go wrong with Bison Witches.

This is one of those places you drive by a million times always thinking to yourself "I have to check that place out" but you never do because you can't figure out exactly where the parking lot is or are always on the way somewhere.  Well, my friends, it's time to stop.  If you like the furniture at DWR but the prices are out of your reach you will enjoy 2b mod.  You get the same style for about half the price.  The store has a small selection of what is actually available (check out their website).  The owner is very friendly and I was told he can arrange for custom pieces...  I have the "Womb Chair" and "Noguchi-esk"coffee table earmarked.

I lived literally across the street from this park before it was the park that it is today.  Needless to say, that was several years ago.  I ventured over here last weekend and was pleasantly surprised by what I found.  The city did a wonderful job creating a beautiful public space.    The dog park was more orderly than I expected.  It wasn't horribly overcrowded (and it was Saturday morning) and all the dog owners were reasonably responsible and in control of their dogs.  There was one total douche-bag  guy that was gabbing away while his dog created problems  through out the park.  He would periodically shout over "Don't worry, he is useless" instead of intervening as his dog bullied the other pups.  One of the other patrons of the park quite appropriated noted "No, you are useless.".  Asshole.  I'm going to give him a piece of my mind if I see him again.     Anyway, despite the slight drama, the pup and I had a great time.  I will definitely take him back for another visit.

After several more outings, I need to dog on the dog park.  The park is great, however, the other dog owners are not.  I really don't understand why people think it is appropriate to sit and talk on a mobile phone while their dog runs amok.  After a couple altercations, I have had enough.  I got into it with one girl who was not supervising her giant dog that kept "mouthing" my puppy's entire head.  He was terrified.  I told her to get control of her dog.  Response?  "Maybe you should take your dog over to the passive dog area, you just don't understand how dogs play."  "Are you kidding me?  My dog is not passive.  You just need to control your dog."  "He's just playing, yesterday he had a whole Pug in is mouth and that dog was fine."  Brilliant reasoning.  I left after that exchange, which I promise you is almost verbatim, and have not been back.

Expectations are funny things.  Once you have them, you are bound to be disappointed.  But I have to say, Yasu did not disappoint.  Popped into this cozy random nook of a restaurant for a random Tuesday night dinner out and it turned out to be everything I hoped it would be and more... knowledgeable server, good atmosphere and sushi that melted in my mouth like butter.  All of the residual stress from a bad day at work evaporated like the haze of water droplets from a mister on a hot Phoenix summer day, leaving me feeling cool, calm and content.  Oh yes, Yasu did not just meet my expectations, it exceeded them.  And I am hard to please.

How is it possible that I have never been here before?  What's wrong with me?  I must be slipping.  Anyway, I finally made it to Lost Leaf for the first ever Phoenix Yelp event and totally feel in love.  This just may be my new favorite place for a mid-week beer.  It is cozily small without being claustrophobic thanks to the raised ceiling and it is perfectly lit.  The music is at exactly the right volume to permit easy conversation (perfect!).  I showed up solo and ended up having a long conversation with a random cool guy at the bar who plays guitar in a couple of local bands.  And then the Yelpers descended.  The variety of seating (bar, high tops, and tables in a lounge area) and open format of the room made it perfect for the group gathering.  Am I over-using the word perfect?  Perhaps.  Perfect.

I have to preface this review by disclosing that I rarely go to the grocery store so my opinion should be taken lightly.  Well, that's not true.  I do go to the grocery store on a regular basis to buy three items: wine, cheese, and magazines.  Sprouts is not good for those items. Don't go there for wine, cheese and magazines.  Sprouts is good for the quarterly health kick, though.  It has a fantastic vitamin section and knowledgeable staff to advise you.  And Kombucha.  I used to drive all the way to Whole Foods just for Kombucha.  I was very pleased to find it at Sprouts.  And the produce is cheap.  So, for vitamins, Kombucha, and actual food items, go to Sprouts.

Homme is part of what I would call "New Phoenix" or "Anti-Scottsdale".  The drinks are cheap, the music is good and the crowd is friendly.  Its got a house party vibe and I mean that in the best possible way.  Did I mention that the crowd is friendly?  Like seriously friendly.  Everytime I gone to Homme I've ended up partying with complete strangers.

Let me jump on the bandwagon and add my praise for Pita Jungle.  I love their new location and not just because it is in my 'hood.  It's open, clean and so far, there have been no service issues.  The food is relatively cheap and the portions are big.  I like the macro platter and the chicken wrap.

I was at my wits end trying to harness the energy of my Vizsla puppy Finnegan.  He was literally bouncing off the walls and various pieces of furniture in my house.  I was seriously in need of my own personal dog whisperer.  A client who owns two Bull Mastiffs highly recommended Team Canine to me, and after a one-on-one training session at my house, I will happily recommend them to all of you in Yelpdom.  Their training techniques are based on positive reinforcement and a true understanding of dog psychology.  They have group classes in addition to the personal training.  I am definitely going to enroll in the group obedience class.

Another Arcadia Farms location that falls squarely in the "ladies who lunch" category and I don't mean that in a negative way.  Located at the Heard Museum, this one has a definite southwestern twist.  I come here about once every two weeks and the food has always been fantastic.   My current favorite item is the pulled pork quesidilla  that was just added to the menu a couple months ago.  The veggie wrap is also quite good.  The posole is a little disappointing.  Don't order the posole. The patio is lovely and relaxing.  Once the weather cools off a little bit more, I highly recommend stopping in for a leisurely lunch.

I would have been absolutely devastated about Sabbudy's in Tempe closing if they hadn't opened a new location.  But they did.  Phew.  I cannot get enough of their potato salad.  It is seriously the best I have ever had.  Even better than Mom's (good thing Mom isn't very adept at surfing the Internet)!  And the falafel.  I always get the falafel.  Do you know what falafel is?  It's fried chickpea paste.  I have no idea how they get fried chickpea paste to taste so good.  And the lentil soup.  And the hummus.  And the wraps.  Okay.  I like it all.  But especially the potato salad.  Make sure you try the potato salad.

I finally went to Palette. I loved it!  I'm not sure what I would say about it on the weekend.  I imagine the vibe is quite different than 7:30 AM on a Wednesday morning.  I had the "Egg", which was a layered creation of puff pastry, bacon and fried eggs, which was served with a generous portion of very fresh fruit.  The coffee was great and my cup was never empty.  The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated.  There isn't a single bad thing I can say about it.  I think I am going to go again this weekend.  I sampled my friend's choice (the seasonal french toast creation)... it was so good I have to go back to get my own plate.

I have no idea how to rate this place.  It is the most random place I have been to in Phoenix.  It is totally hit or miss.  I have had rockin' nights here and totally lame nights here.  You just have to roll the dice.  I love that it is in a run down shopping center bordered by construction fencing.  It adds to the experience for sure.

They have good breakfast, who knew?  I must have driven by this place a zillion times (okay, that is clearly an exaggeration) , but never stopped in until one random Saturday morning after being, uhhhh... "stranded" at a "friends" house for the night.  He lived just up the street from dish, so we made our way there for breakfast.  The menu is limited, but my breakfast was excellent.  I also really enjoyed the modern decor.  I am not often in this part of town for breakfast, but it definitely has my approval.  Check it out.

This is by far my favorite shop in the Valley.  Every item I have purchased here has quickly become a favorite in my wardrobe.  I would classify the clothing here as trendy/sophisticated and wearable.  Maybe I'm biased because it regularly stocks my favorite lines (Rachel Pally, Alice + Olivia, Trina Turk).    I don't know.  What I can tell you is that the girls here have always been amazingly helpful and genuine.  This store also has a great selection of jeans.  They also offer a service called Closet Therapy (they come to your house and weed out your closet for you and help you put outfits together) and host fashion previews and truck shows.

Just northwest of 32nd and Camelback, wrapping around the Biltmore Golf Course, is a 2 mile paved residential street known to locals as "the Biltmore Loop" (Biltmore Estate Drive).  It is flat loop with light traffic.  It is perfect for doing intervals if you are training for a long distance running event, or just an evening stroll if that is more your speed.  It's fun to check out the multi-million dollar digs and it is relatively scenic with the golf course and the mountains as a backdrop.  I mean, there is a reason why there is a 20 million dollar house for sale on this loop (I'm not kidding, I saw the sign with my own eyes).  I always feel safe running here.  There is usually at least a few people running or walking the loop.  I suggest parking by Hava Java and running up to Colter to cut over onto the loop.

It was a dark and stormy night...  After driving through what seemed like the 7th dimension of hell, I arrived at Bomberos.  It was warm, inviting and filled with a palpable energy.  As I took in my surroundings and scanned the menu, my first impression was "latin Postino" - the room was open with a variety of seating that would certainly spill out onto the lovely outdoor patio on a typical glorious Phoenix evening, a menu of wines by the glass from South America, and cheeses, bruschetta, and other "light fare".  Needless to say, my first impression was quite good.    Then came the wine.  And a sampling of light fare.  And a second glass of wine.  And... it was all just okay.  I tend to be a little overly focused on food sometimes, especially when I am hungry like I was that night, so I was initially tripped up my this slight misstep.  I initially thought, Bomberos, 3 stars.    But now as I am sitting here, the food seems rather immaterial.  Had I just gone for drinks, I would have docked it 1 star for the so-so wine, but that's about all.  As I am sitting here now, what I remember is a well-lit room, full of warmth, with music humming around me, full of people having fun.    So, 4 stars it is.  Potential to add 1 star if they re-work the wine menu.  I will be back for sure.

The steak was so good I started having heart palpitations.  Oh my god, I don't even know where to begin.  The dining room is beautiful.  The service was flawless.  And the food was out of this world.  Really tremendous.  The ahi tuna tartar?  Amazing.  The bone-in-fillet? Amazing.  Lobster mashed potatoes?  Are you kidding me?  Ridiculous.  By far, the best steak I have ever had.  Better than Flemings, Capital Grill, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Durant's, El Chorro...  Seriously.  You are looking at about $100/head including drinks (not wine) and it is worth every penny.  I'm going to go pass out now.

For those who may remember the original Lowdown Cafe on 24th Street, heads up.  They've relocated. The new space is much more zen then the former strip mall location next to the sketchy 7-Eleven.  Below is my original review of the 24th Street location.  Every single word is still absolutely true.  ______________  Lowdown offers healthy homemade wraps, salads, and freshly prepared soup.  My favorites are the "Grilled Veggie Wrap" and the "Corridor Princess Salad."  A box lunch will cost you 6 - 8 bucks and comes with your choice of sandwich/wrap, a drink, chips, and a homemade cookie.  And they deliver for free!  Breakfast is pretty good as well.  Apparently, the two gals that own and run this little gem are Silicon Valley burn-outs who left after the big crash.  A little taste of Cali in the Valley.   I highly recommend Lowdown.

I've been back a few times, so thought it was time for an update.  Unfortunately, it was worse than I remembered!  I really don't think the food is very good.  I got the mushroom scramble last time. It was disgusting.  I know those are strong words, but that is the way I feel.  The food is way overpriced for what you get.  I would rather put up with the hoards of annoying people at LGO than eat here.

I have to say, this place is quite a gem.  It is good enough for me to make the haul from Phoenix to the northland for lunch on the weekends.  I had the "sloppy joes" but it was not like anything my mom ever made (in a good way).  The fries are outstanding.  I had lunch with 8 other people, and they were all equally as pleased.  Service was great. Wine was excellent.  The setting was laid-back and comfortable.  I am really looking forward to going back.

Noble Beast has a fantastic selection of super premium pet food.  It is one of the only places in town that sells Evo by Innova.  I also discovered "Sam's Yams" here, which my puppy absolutely loves.  The staff is extremely knowledgable about pet foods and super nice.  The only downside?  Too many cool things to buy your pet!  The last time I was in there I dropped $148 in about 10 minuted.  Ouch.  The dog is eating better than me.  I just had a bowl of cereal for dinner.

Cold.  Bad music (think cheesy nightclub music aimed at the non-hip aging segment of the population). Not a good selection of food.  Not a good selection of wine by the glass.  Overall, I would say this place has an identity crisis going on.  It has great potential, and the owners have obviously sunk some major bucks into the design.  However, it is lacking that certain something something.  Lots of room for improvement.  I wil check back in a few months.

The spot for ladies who lunch...  need I say more?  Upscale lunch.  Very nice soups, salads, and lunch entrees.  Lovely patio.  Loud and bustling, full of botoxed ladies in tennis attire. You might feel out of place if you don't have a LV handbag, or even worse, you have no idea what I am talking about.  Make reservations.  This place is booked every day.
