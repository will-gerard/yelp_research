Seriously, the charm of this place is the people. It's been through allot in the last couple of years, changing hands and reverting back to the owner who had it for decades. This last loser stole everything of value, defaced the sign and closed the doors leaving an entire staff of loyal employees jobless because he couldn't get a liquor license. It WILL re-open. The bar tenders know how to pour a good drink, the food is cheap and good but the staff and patrons are like family. Think "Cheers" in the west. Can't wait to be able to walk in again and welcome back June and Eliot. :)

I discovered Brigitts as a neighborhood activist in the area, but I started going in when my ex-husband left me. I wanted a place close to where I lived that I could go to alone to kill some lonely evenings but be safe and not harassed, meaning not a typical pick up joint. I found the right place. The people were friendly. the staff quickly remembered me and what I drank. I loved the karaoke  with Terry. But eventually I moved and stopped coming in. for a while. LOL Shockingly, I have re-married. My new husband has his own fave neighborhood bar, but it has recently changed hands. So, we know what kinda change THAT brings. The time was ripe to introduce him to Brigitt's. So, we have started coming in and enjoying the food as well as the adult beverages. LOL LOVE the food! Tacos are AMAZING! Great wings. I gotta thing going with the chicken tenders. Everyone comes here. Yes, there are bikers. And guys in suits. Retirees. College age kids. Just plain ole down to earth nice people.Yes, the ladies restroom is a lil cramped. I try to think of it as quirky. But the place has been busy and in business for years. That has to say something, right? This IS the perfect neighborhood where-everyone-knows-your-name bar. I've come back home and this time I am home to stay. With my new husband, of course! :)

My husband and I periodically accompany my husbands elderly parents to this location. My elderly in-law's loyalty to this location stems from a server, Michael. I wanted to let the management and Michael himself know how much my husband and I appreciate him and the care and kindness he shows our parents. They are in their eighties, and I know they can sometimes be difficult. How ever, they feel Michael is more like family than just an employee that cares for them in a restaurant. Michael goes above and beyond to make the feel welcome and as if they are the only table in the restaurant. This has not just been once or twice. My husband and I married five years ago. I believe it was sometime that first year I went with them to your store, the first time for my birthday, so he has been waiting on them for several years, each time as if they were his favorite customers ever. If I recall correctly, a few years back Michael injured his knee or had knee surgery or something along that line, and our parents were not sure if they would ever come back because if Michael was gone, so were they! Anyway, food and beverage is a difficult business. I just waned you to know how amazing Michael is. Thank you to you both. And we have had no occasion that were not happy and satisfied with the food and did not leave with enough food for lunch the following day. :)  P.S. We were just in for Mom's birthday, and we also gave her another Red Lobster gift card. Dad's birthday is in June, so we most certainly will be seeing you all again very soon. :)  And a P.S. To Doc H. Thank you for your amusing review. If you are looking for "fine dining", don't take your snooty European friends to a family chain restaurant. Red Lobster does not pretend to be anything more than it is, an affordable chain seafood restaurant. Seriously, get over your fine falutin' self! LOL

First, I am addicted to their original fish tacos. Everything is made on sight. Every order is made fresh and served piping hot. Every time I have been to this location, they have showed me my order for approval before bagging it to go. It is always spotless. But one of the things that strikes me the most at this location is the friendliness of the staff. Not only do they seem happy to see me, they all seem to genuinely like their job. Love the salsa and fresh chips. Great prices. Good portions. I cannot think of a single negative thing to say. Happy regular customer. :)

If you like a dive bar with good food and friendly staff and patrons, I believe you have found your bar. Happy Hour 3:30p-8p. (Yeah, you read that right. A recent change. )Fifty cent wings-YUUUUUUUUUMMM! We went on a Wednesday, February 18th about 6p. It's a really small place, but it was pretty full. They had a bartender, cook and one waitress working the floor. And that waitress was FAST and friendly. The only thing I didn't like, I wish they had a a larger bar area. My husband and I always prefer to hang at the bar at dive bars so we can get to know the regulars and make new friends. Can't do that in a booth. Going to be praying a new space opens up so that this little place can expand. After years of being loyal patrons at Wagon Yard, new owners are pushing the old timers out the door and taking the once successful bar "in a new direction." Good luck with that. Knew the breakfast cook here ;) and decided to give it a shot.  Yes, it was worth it! See you soon, Stackers!

My husband and I love this place and drive out here regularly. It's a pretty bare bones atmosphere with fantastic burgers and a friendly staff and clientele. Quality is consistent. LOVE the chili!   (Hi Sherry! ;) )

The consistently most disgusting convenience store I have ever been in. I try to avoid it and usually go to the adjacent store on the northwest corner but occasionally go in because of the convenience depending on what direction I am coming from.  I have always regretted it. Today I chose not to get a soda because the machines, the cup dispenser, the lid dispenser were so filthy. I will not be in here again. Blech!

A gift card brought us in, although my daughter has often raved about this place. The prices were excellent. The portions were generous. The food was delicious. I had catfish. My husband had the sirloin steak. We both left full and happy. The server was amazing. The manager stopped by our table to see how we were doing. The one thing that might keep us from returning is that it is very, very loud, particularly when there is a birthday. Otherwise, this Roadhouse is a keeper.

I started going here last year on the recommendation of a friend. I was referred to Amy, so that is who I have seen all but one time when Amy was on vacation, so I saw Tina. I was very uncomfortable and nervous at first as I knew nothing about acrylic nails. Never-the-less, my husband had convinced me to do this one extravagant thing for myself. And I have to admit, I love having the fancy nails! I would say Amy has probably done my nails a dozen times by now. She is warm and friendly and remembers me on each visit. She knows I like "fancy, sparkly nails" and is so creative and always has new designs for me to choose from. The place is frequently busy when I have been in and yet, I never feel Amy rushes. The spa itself is beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. I would describe Tina "highly energetic" and she made me laugh. A lot. I loved the nails she did for me, as well. The gentleman at the front desk sat and chatted with me my last visit as I had to wait a few minutes. Everyone I have dealt with have been professional and friendly. I have only been to one other nail place, so I am no expert. However, I know that all my experiences here have been positive. I talk to other people that go to other salons and complain that their nails fall off. I have never had a single problem. I have added some pictures of my nails.

Where to start? We went for our daughter's birthday party. Took a while to get our first drinks. My gin and tonic was soda water. If there was gin in it, it was undetectable. I hate soda water. Never successfully go that corrected. And it was the same with my husband's bourbon and diet. The "talls" were served in Dixie cups. I used a coupon for a free glass of Chardonay. Guess I should have had a draft beer. It was disgusting. The music was so loud, conversation between more than two people was an impossibility. I am familiar with the club scene, so I do have a source of comparison. Strangely, all the music I heard was from 2005-2010. I heard nothing current. Conversation was possible only if you put your mouth in contact with a person's ear.  In spite of the fact there were plenty of tables open and the table had been reserved for two hours., the server was constantly trying to move us to a smaller table as some of the party goers were not there on the dot of 9p. Weirdly, lights were turned off in the back at about 10:15p. It was so dark, we couldn't see the people in the booths beside us. Then a couple came around with a clip board asking for person information for some drawing. I politely told them I keep my private information, well, private and that I did not intend to come back. In short, try a new marketing ploy, thank you. We didn't stay long enough to eat.  Nor did we stay long enough to watch girls dance on the bar at midnight. I mean, REALLY???
