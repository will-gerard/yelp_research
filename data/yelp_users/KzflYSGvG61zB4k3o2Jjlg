We always have a great time here. Usually come in for kid's birthdays. The whole family has a great time. It is just another pizza place, but we have grown very accustomed to it. The employees keep the place pretty clean and the pizza is always hot. Hope the bathrooms have been renovated...

I have been coming here since I was a child. I love this place! There are so many things to do. Animals, mazes, food, you name it. My parents would bring us here when we were younger, and now I get to pass the tradition on to my own little family. Good times. Parking sucks though. LoL.

My family has been coming to this place FOREVER. I love it! The food is delicious, the service is efficient, and the prices are right. I will continue to come here, and highly suggest it to anyone. It is however, a hole in the wall... which is usually where you find the best food. I wouldn't suggest you take someone for a first date as the decor is mediocre at best, but if your date is not stuck up, and they like good food, go for it.

Meh. This place was just okay. Service took their time getting to us. The price was not what I expected for what we got. Over priced everything. Sorry. I will not be returning.

The trails here are unbelievable! They have everything for everyone. Long hikes, short hikes, steep hikes, easy hikes. I love it! I'm very outdoorsy, but can never find anyone to go with. Alls well. I don't mind rolling solo.

The husband and I come to this theater all the time, because the price is right, the location is 2 blocks away, and it's a pretty clean place. Get the loyalty cups. They pay off in the end. The theater is usually not too packed, but I'd hey there 20 minutes early just in case.

This place is great. I'm short so my legs don't cover mountain as fast as most's, but I love the challenge. This hike is a little long, but not very steep. Great for jogging. The view of people's backyards isn't great... kinda feel like a creep when the homeowners are out. LoL. It's in a great area though

I love this place! Everything is delicious! I love the eel and booty booty rolls! The husband loves the caterpillar roll. I usually come in for a light lunch when I'm through hiking. I always bring in my friends... sushi nubs or sushi haters just so I can get them to change or makeup their minds. LoL. Service is great and there is always seating.

So far so good. We are doing blood draws for labs now. The initial consult was a bit pricey. $110... we already had the xrays. She basically told us what we already knew, but did also let us know what needed to be done to correct the break. She gave us several options. We took the least expensive route. $3600... ouch! Hope this works. To be continued...

He's all fixed up! My baby is going to do great. The staff here is awesome. I'm glad we brought our pup here. Can't wait until he starts getting around again.

Love this IHOP. My last visit was a couple of days ago. We were sat right away. My server was awesome. He had a Spanish name I can't recall now, but he was amazing. I usually get bad service when I go to restaurants with just my little one, because most servers tend to misjudge me... thinking I'm a single mom, and probably not a great tipper. LoL. Anywho, this server was patient, and very considerate. I didn't even need to ask for a glass of water with my coffee. He just brought it out. My bill was small, but his tip was not. He deserved every penny. Wish more people were like him.

I love this place!!! They have it all, and they let you rent guns. I like to do that before I make a purchase. The ranges are clean, and the staff is super helpful. I do suggest you take your own firearms and ammo. Their stuff can be a bit pricey. I am a huge firearm enthusiast! I don't believe in gun control... unless you mean controling the recoil on your pistol. LoL. Happy shooting!

I've only been here once. Granted, it was some time ago,  I just felt I should speak my piece... I came here for a tongue piercing. They stick the piercing needle in pulled it out and stuck a barbell in it. I know it's supposed to be a little big for swelling, but this stake was huge! It ripped my tongue. I went to my friend's place when I noticed it wasn't healing (he's a pro and I now regret not going to him first) and he told me the stake they put in my tongue should never have been used for the tongue. He removed it for me just before my tongue was split in half. I never did get my tongue repierced. I won't return.

I'm giving this place 2 stars, and that in itself is generous. The husband and I decided to try something new, and with my love of Mexican food I was hoping this place would be good... especially because we live down the road. Unfortunately, our hopes were destroyed. We found a spot to sit, and were surrounded by dirty, unbussed, tables. The server was also the cashier. She was nice, but didn't really have much of a personality. Nevermind all that, let's talk about the food. Everything was very bland. Guess we've never heard of seasoning... you know, salt pepper, garlic, onion, the staples to Mexican Cuisine? All well. Guess my search for delicious Mexican food shall continue... happy eatings people.

I love this place! Arcade, bowling, bars, food, laser tag... I could go on, but I don't want to. The prices are a bit much, but it is like a one stop shop for entertainment. It's nice to have this place. Especially, way out here in Surprise. Fun for the whole family. Service is definitely lacking, but the good times make up for that.

Love this location. Just a hop, skip, and jump from my house. Plus, it's on my way to and from work. The staff is very helpful, especially the bald guy that works the counter. I always go in for my Monster Rehabs. It also helps that the fueling stations are super clean.

Every time I go here, I order at the bar. Sasha is the best bar tender in the joint. She always gets my drink right, sometimes I don't even have to order. The only bad thing about this place is, I always see the same people. Guess I can't blame the place as it is located in bum fuk Egypt. LoL. If you want good drinks, and a good time come here, but bring your own friends. LoL.

The husband took me to the location at parkwest to celebrate mother's day, the Saturday before the actual holiday. We waited 5 minutes for the server to take our order. The place was empty. We couldn't figure out why everything took so long. We ordered drinks and by the time they got to us we ordered more just so they would be out in a timely manner. When our main course finally came around we had to retrieve hot sauce from another table, then wait for our server to come back because my husband didn't get the egg he ordered on his burger. We spent $108 between the two of us, and had to wrap it all up so we wouldn't miss the movie next door. All in all, food was descent, but service was definitely lacking.

This place is clean. I come here all the time. It is a pain in the ass when you make the trip just to find that the computers are down. The employees are super friendly. I think this place is great. I would recommend it, but would urge you to call and make sure the computers are up and running.
