DOWNHILL.  I've been eating at Luke's a few times a month since 1996.  Over the last few years, It's slowly been going downhill.  Their signature Italian Beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold.  The extremely hard crusted french bread used to be dipped in au ju (gravy) to soften them up and load the sandwich with flavor.  Now, no matter how you order it (extra gravy, wet, etc.) the sandwich comes out almost completely dry and is guaranteed to destroy the roof of your mouth.  I'm really disappointed to see a restaurant I've had so many good lunches wither away, but even their health inspections have made dining here risky at best.  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=11712&business=LUKE'S%20RESTAURANT&address=1602%20%20%20E%20%20INDIAN%20SCHOOL%20RD&permitid=SG13198  All this and their prices have been skyrocketing!  Save your money and your health and go somewhere else.

This is by far one best McDonalds I've ever been to!  French Fries are always fresh & HOT, drive through is always fast, special orders are completed by the time I get to the final window, and the most important thing - my order is always correct when I get home or to the office.  Drive through is open 24 hours for those late night cravings.  They even have a charging station for your electric vehicle and a large indoor playground for the kids.

Someday I'll branch out and try some other dishes, but the Chicken Cesar Pita keeps me coming back!  Chicken is always hot, lettuce always fresh and well chilled - The perfect combination!  And at $4.95, you can't beat it!  I actually like the fact that it's served on a traditional pita (taco style), not a burrito pita like most other pita joints.

I've eaten here since they opened and have never had a bad meal.  The chicken katsu is always hot.  The spam musubi is good here though nothing special.  The regular size menu items are large enough for 2 sensible meals.   I love the fact that their more popular meals are available in "mini-meal" versions that give you just the right amount of food.

The food is great here!  From fried zucchini to pizza to chicken parmesan, you can't go wrong.  Their homemade garlic Italian salad dressing is nothing short of amazing.  The only cons here is the service is often slow and can be a little mouthy.  We've seen people walk out before ordering because of it.  Bring in your favorite bottle of wine and they'll provide the glasses.

Friendly, Caring, and Honest.  What more can you expect from an animal hospital?  Their new building is very attractive and roomy and the staff is very accommodating.  They're prices are reasonable as well.  Thanks for taking such good care of Mufassa guys!

This place is nothing short of amazing!  I've had my cat groomed with a lion cut for the 12 years i've had her and she's been to plenty of groomers.  None of them meet the quality she gets here.  I've been going back here for the 4 years I've lived in central phoenix.

Kachina Dry Cleaners was recommending to me by a senior level banking friend of mine that has had his weekly dry cleaning done here for years and swears by them.    This is an outstanding cleaners.  Everything Kevin says about the older lady I feel is absolutely true.  She really is the sweetest thing ever.  I've been going here for a year and a half and even after trying another more convenient location for me, I keep coming back.  My clothes are always perfectly crisp and ready to wear.    Just 2 weeks ago, I went to put on one of my dressier shirts but noticed some sort of splatter stain down the left side of the shirt.  I don't wear this shirt very often and in fact it had been over a year since Kachina had cleaned it.  I was impressed that she took it back and cleaned it with very little grief.  If you haven't tried these guys, you should!  Their prices are great for the quality and level of service they give.

This is a great neighborhood bar and has a suprisingly tasty breakfast and the food is VERY reasonable priced.  They have Blue Moon on tap, so be sure to get a "Blue Moon & O.J." instead of a mimosa with brunch.  Live band on the weekend nights is very entertaining but can be a bit too loud for conversation.  TVs just about everywhere provide excellent coverage for whatever game(s) are on.  This place isn't flashy, but it's always clean.  Just be aware that you'll end up smelling like a deep fryer after spending any amount of time in here.  The crowd is always friendly and the service is usually top notch.

The food here is consistently good with few exceptions.  They have a knack for hiring people that don't have a basic understanding of taking a basic pizza order, but at least the kitchen delivers.  This could be circumvented by placing an order online, if only this location still accepted delivery orders online (carry out only).  This is location has indoor tables to eat at if you want someone else to clean up the mess - just order at the counter and they'll bring the pizza to your table when it's ready.

The eclectic crowd and positive vibe of this bar make it a must stop for locals and visitors.  Make no mistake though, this is a gay man's country bar.  They cater to country music fans, then late night crowds when the cowboys fizzle out.  I've had a lot of people tell me, and I agree, they play the best Country music of any gay OR straight bar in town.  Usually the higher energy stuff.  If you can't handle country music, the bar is almost always high-energy dance after midnight and has after-hours till 4am Fri / Sat nights.    PARKING The parking lot is newly paved & monitored under video surveillance 24/7.  Security walks the parking lot at night during business hours.  In many years of going here, I've never had any problems with any of my vehicles being broken into.  DRINKS / BARTENDERS This is a drinking man's bar.  Most of the bartenders like watching people get drunk as long as they can keep it under control.  To accomplish this, the drinks are usually strong but being friendly, polite, and tipping decently usually goes a long way.  Leaving a $2 tip for $20 in shots/drinks will surely get you a weak pour the next round.  I've found that if you're nice and respectful to the bartenders here, they will make you feel like a High-Roller.  DANCE FLOOR The dance floor is relatively small for a country bar this size.  That means if a line dance song comes on and you don't know the dance, the DJ will remind you to get off the dance floor so you're not in the way.  When the dance music starts, the tight dance floor makes for a fun, uninhibited evening that is even more fun if the bartenders did their job.  [wink, wink]  PURSES This is a semi-dive bar and can attract the usual dive-bar antics. Purses are limited to the size of a typical bank cash bag to keep people from sneaking in their own booze or anything else you shouldn't have in a bar.  The manager knows the door guy is doing his job when he doesn't see any medium/large purses in the bar.  The door guy wants his job so it won't do you any good to argue with him.  Also, nobody wants your huge purse banging against them all night - please leave that diaper bag in Scottsdale.

We stopped here for the first time after a day on the boat and none of us were in the mood to be picky.  Even with this being the case, we were all quite disappointed with the food here.  This certainly is NOT Tex-Mex.  It's the type of mexican food you would expect from a school or nursing home cafeteria.  The salsa is little more than pureed tomatoes with a little chili pepper to give it some heat.  There's no flavor to it except raw tomato.  Adding a lot of Cholula made it tolerable at best.  We ordered the Cadillac Fajita's,  The steak itself was quite tasty, but it was disappointing that $25 fajita's only come with tortillas, sour cream, pico de gallo, and cheese.   Guacamole, Rice, or Beans are all extra.  The tortillas were inconsistent in shape & thickness.  They were all some sort of oblong and a little crunchy on the outside edges.  The onions and peppers were served completely raw with only the heat of the fajita plate partially cooking a small portion of them.  Spanish Rice was made with converted rice giving it the texture of rice pilaf.  This is a gross way to make rice that can sit around for a LONG time.  One of the gals in our group ordered chicken soft tacos... they were so bad she only ate 1 and left the rest.  The only thing that gave them 2 stars was the service.  Our waitress was very friendly and there when we needed her.

After giving up on Luke's many months ago, I've been looking for a place to get my beef on. I'm not sure why it took me so long to build up my courage to try this place, but I finally ventured in today for lunch. While not the best sandwich I've had, this definitely fills the need. Juicy flavorful sandwich with super soft fresh bread.   The place is REALLY clean. They've only had 2 major health violations in the nearly 2 years they've been open. Most restaurants typically have 2-3 PER VISIT.   I had the 6" cheese steak with provolone and grilled onions. I loved that the grilled onions were thinly diced and not the typically stringy style. There was the perfect amount of them, not a heaping distraction from the great steak.   The fries were perfectly crispy (slightly overcooked, which I love) and hot.   The diet coke tasted great as well.   All this for under $10? Not too bad. I'll be back for sure!

Wow!  This Chili's was better than the one at 16th St and Camelback. Appetizers came out lightning fast and the service was very quick.  Under 30 mins in and out.  We'll be stopping here again next time we fly!

I don't care what the other reviewers say, this place is really good.  The House Special Chicken is great.  This location is VERY clean and the food is always hot & tastes fresh.  They get a gold award every time from the health department.

Burgers that live up to the hype!  Their frys are pretty darned good.  Corn dogs are delicious state fair style and the onion rings are some of the best I've had.

OVERVIEW: I've been here 5 times with my friends from opening night through just 2 weeks ago and we all have yet to have a good time here.  Phoenix is in desperate need for a great gay dance bar.  Year after year Charlie's, a gay country western bar, wins "Best Dance Bar".  Unfortunately, Club Forbidden is apparently not up to the challenge - blown speakers, inconsistent drinks, poor parking, & a typically bitchy crowd makes this IKEA/Trading Spaces remake of a classic scottsdale dive bar, not worth the effort.  MUSIC: Blown speakers when you first walk in the main entrance is the perfect indication of what you're in for: the music is always too loud.  What's worse is there is no place to get away from it and socialize with your friends unless you can handle choking on thick cigarette smoke on the small, noisy, overly crowded, parking lot patio. As mentioned in other reviews, the main room's DJ plays an iPod Shuffle style mixture of Top 40s music from the past 25 years with no logical flow.  The music in the smaller electronica room is much better and is more likely to instill that "OMG, I this mix is awesome, I want it!" emotion we have all experienced going to a great nightclub.  Unfortunately, like the main room, the music is too loud to enjoy here as well and ears are ringing after just a few moments.  DRINKS: Drinks range from weak to mediocre.  Typically my drinks were barely 1 shot for an Absolut and Redbull served in a large glass.  I felt waterlogged before I could feel the slightest buzz.  BOTTOM LINE: My friends and I REALLY want to like this bar (that's why we've gone back 4 more times) but it just can't compare to how good the late Boom and the late Crowbar (now DWNTWN) were.

Beautiful Art-Deco dinner theater with amazing talent.  A great excuse to get dressed up!  Bought tickets online for my hubby and my dad to see My Fair Lady when he was visiting from out of town.  Online ordering and the website is HORRIBLE.  Even the theater manager said it was best to call the box office to book tickets.  When you book your tickets online, a floor plan shows which seats are available at what tables.  When we got to the theater, there was a group already in our seats.  After talking to the house manager, he said the seats were "first come, first serve" and despite seat numbers on the floor plan and tickets, the reservation was only for the table, not specific seats.  At least he accommodated us with free desert.  After that issue was resolved, it was comical watching people escorted to tables that were already full and the manager scrambling to find a table that hadn't been double booked.  Quite disappointing for an $85+ ticket.  The food was better than expected from a dinner theater in Peoria.  The only disappointing part was the salad - the egg was baked in the same pans as the cornbread muffins and was so rubbery my knife wouldn't even cut through it.  The bacon on the salad was cold and overcooked as well and would have been better from a bag. All of our entrees were served warm, not hot, but the flavor was quite good on the Pork Tenderloin.  I even ate the broccoli!  The saving grace and main reason I might venture back is the wait staff and the quality of the show.  The staff is very talented (both on and off stage) and quite attentive.  All in all, $85 for 5 hours of dinner & live entertainment is a good deal, just make sure you get your own table or get to the theater extra early to line up to get your desired seats.

OK food but awkward layout and poorly trained staff.    Half the time I order by number and the girl taking my order has no clue what I'm trying to order.  Often they put my name down in an unrecognizable spelling that when they call my order, I have no idea it's me.    The takeout orders are handed out in the middle of the ordering line so you have people bumping up against you while you sit and wait.    The steak and chicken almost always have several big chunks of gristle you have to spit out.  After a year of alternating between Yoshi's and Yogi's, it's time for me to go back to Yoshi's exclusively.

I was REALLY disappointed with this "cleaners". I use quotes around cleaners because they don't actually do any of the cleaning here. Everything is sent out. Who actually does the cleaning? who knows? Did I mention they're Prepay cash only? They will take an ATM card, but there's a $.50 fee. No credit cards.   I brought in 8 western shirts and a few pairs of pants to be cleaned and starched. 2 of the shirts have glass buttons and I was told they had to be dry cleaned (at a higher cost) instead of laundered because they had broke one of the glass buttons on one other shirt.   When I picked up my items, I was appalled that the sleeves were not crossed and clipped in front like EVERY other cleaner I've been to.  They were just hanging at the sides and wedged into 2 bags which ended up leaving "waves" in the shirts. I have a steamer at home, but I don't appreciate steaming clothes I paid to have pressed.   When I picked up my shirts, I inspected them and found one of the shirts had a LARGE crease right in the front. What's worse, is they couldn't just iron it out there. This cleaner doesn't even have an iron. They had to send it back out and I had to make another trip 2 days later to pick it up.   The gal behind the counter was pleasant and the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars.  Their ability to do what they're supposed to do: 1 star.  My advise: if you get a cranberry juice stain on a white shirt like Erica M., use oxyclean.  Don't waste your money here.

We had a guest staying with us from NYC and wanted to impress him with a fantastic Sunday brunch.  The food at Petite is consistently top notch and the services is always helpful and we have never felt rushed.    I know some times fancy or french restaurants can be a little intimidating.  Our server, Amy, did a fantastic job of making us feel comfortable and took excellent care of us.  The 3 course Prix Fixe includes bottomless mimosas and is well worth the price.  I started with the mussels which were fantastic and not fishy at all.  Then I moved to the steak and eggs.  I prefer my eggs over medium.  Instead of simply flipping the egg to cook the other side, chef used a torch to cook the other side so the egg didn't have a mashed, browned appearance. This attention to detail is what really sets Petite apart from the rest.  For dessert, I usually have the beignets but wanted to mix it up so I got the Nutella crepe with bananna.  It was a prefect finish to an outstanding meal.  Our out of town guest said it was the best brunch he had ever had!

A great place to get an $8 1/3 pound burger and fries.  This is a fast food burger place for people that a willing to pay a little more for quality.  I got the BBQ, Bacon, Onion String, & Cheddar Burger with SmashFries.  The egg bun (that's the only kind I buy for home) is grilled and quite tasty.  Burger was delicious, though the bacon wasn't quite cooked enough and was difficult to gnaw through.  The fries were quite good, but left me wanting some sort of aioli to dip them in.  Properly cooked bacon & a custom fry sauce would merit 5 stars but I will definitely be back.

A few of my friends used Shake It Up for parties they hosted and I was impressed with the how professional, but not stuffy, the bartenders were.  All the guests at these events had rave reviews.  I decided to use them for the 30th birthday party I was throwing for my husband and his best friend.  We were expecting about 30 people, so I wanted a bartender to set a somewhat upscale mood and reduce the stress on us as hosts.  Booking was effortless and they worked with us to make sure we had a bartender that would mesh well with our guests.    Daneel showed up on time and was outstanding!  A true professional bartender, she even made a couple birthday shots for everyone based on the liquor we had and everyone raved at how good they were.  I will not hesitate to use Shake It Up for the next party.

I trusted the other reviewers on yelp and they are spot on!    My crossfire looks fantastic!  The film is perfect.  No orange peel, no dirt in the film.  I cannot rave enough about it.  You will not regret using these guys.

Chick has the potential to be a restaurant we want to keep coming back to.  The food will keep us trying for an exceptional experience, but some things needs to be fixed if Chick is to see it's first anniversary.  1.)  The space:  Cute slightly upper scale boutique "farmhouse".  Decor and lighting is warm yet modern.  The only miss: The beautiful tables.  They are heavily distressed with very deep grooves as if made from reclaimed wood.  There can't possibly be any way for them to clean the tables thoroughly - The thought of a small portion of everyone's food that has dined here before me staring at me -- especially as time goes on and those grooves fill up with food & germs grosses me out.  A piece of glass on each table is a definite food safety must.  To make matters worse, tables are set with your silverware on the bare table.  Silverware should never be placed on anything other than a fresh a napkin or table cloth.    2.)  The menu:  The menu they offer is a little different from your average restaurant which can make for a memorable experience.  However, putting a menu like theirs in a small but thick leather bound binder with just a couple items per page made us feel like unwelcome outsiders.  The incessant flipping between pages with types of entrees and sides and sauces was quite frustrating.  I recommend picking up the takeout menu at the front door and using that to navigate the menu.  3.)  The service: Awkward but very friendly.  Our waiter seemed like a foodie fit for a restaurant like this, but his table presence left us feeling like we needed to make *him* comfortable talking to us or requesting anything.  I had to fight most of the meal to have more than 3-4 ice cubes in my iced tea.  After asking a couple members of the staff for a glass of ice, they kept bringing back my glass with just more tea and no more ice. At one point, the server brought my iced tea glass back without a straw.  When I asked for one, his reply was "can you use the one from your water glass for now?"  4.)  The food:  This is what made up for most of the other shortcomings especially because Chick is still new.  I had the country pork with creamed corn and mashed potato "bar".  You get 3 toppings with the mashed potato which the chefs will assemble for you.  I chose mesquite sour cream, applewood smoked bacon, and Vermont white cheddar - Delicious!  The creamed corn was very tasty as well.  The mandarin orange chutney paired amazingly well with the pork.  My husband had the chicken and dumplings.  It's a little different from the traditional C&D, but was very good.  It's served in a lighter broth instead of a heavy sauce which was a welcome change.  We decided next time the hubby and I go, we would take our chances at the bar and avoid the servers until they can get caught up on their service skills.

The food I've had here is pretty good but they have somethings to work out.  The biggest is the ordering process.    You are handed a menu when you walk in and people stand around the line entrance figuring out what they want.  Once you know what you want, you can't just order it.  You have to walk through a hurried line where seemingly every person on the way asks you what you ordered or if you want what they have to offer.  You tell them what you want then at the end of the line, a disorganized pile of prepared dishes sits at the end of the line when you are again asked everything you ordered and expected to remember what the name of your sandwich, salad, or soup was called.  I agree with the other reviewer about how stingy they are.  For me it was the "upgrades" that I have an issue with.  None of their soups come garnished.  Want tortilla strips on your tortilla soup?  That's an extra $.69.   A Tablespoon of orzo pasta in our tomato soup?  $.69 extra per scoop.  All in all, their food is good, but these issues make me go here 1 out of 10 times I think about it.  Throw the crazed parking that Camelback Colonade offers and it's just not worth it any more often than once every few months.

This is a fantastic space and a great addition to downtown!  It's a hip little small bites and cocktails place.  Lots of great outdoor space and even a cozy private room if your crew needs some space.  You really feel like you're in the middle of the urban city center when you're inside the bar.  The patio on 3rd St has some of the best views of downtown you can see while downtown.  RACIST?  Pretty sure the other reviewers that are claiming racism here are full of BS.  Maybe competitors trying to shut down any new bar before it takes off?  We were here with a group of 12, mixed races, and all of us were treated like gold.      We tried the meat pierogi's, sliders, and fries - All were good.  Excited to try more of their nibbles next time we go back.

If you drink on a semi regular basis you know that cab fares can add up!  My typical 6 mile ride costs $10 with Sunrise and $14 with Discount.  From what I can tell, these cabs are all former fire chief 1980's Chevys painted white (the inside door jams are still red).  They are perfect when you've been drinking and are less likely to care about the exhaust fumes and are a great option to driving drunk when you want an inexpensive cab and don't care who sees how you get home.
