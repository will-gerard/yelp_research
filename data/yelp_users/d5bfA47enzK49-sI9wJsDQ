Good coffee. I loved the Chill atmosphere. I also like the late hours. Was introduced by a friend that I had to meet with later at night. Will be stopping by again soon!

Being originally from Seattle, I'd like to say that I know what a good latte tastes like. I am very happy I found this spot! The white russian latte was simply amazing and the  location is great. Very happy i stopped in. Will be back!

This is my favorite place! I have been going here every two-three weeks since 2011. Larry and Lillian do amazing work, and so do the other technicians. I try to bring my daughters in once a month too and they are always so sweet to the kids. Great customer service.. I always leave happy.

I am extremely frustrated with this location. I am 9 months pregnant, I have two children currently and have a car that needed some work so I can drive my children around safely so I went to Fletchers. I went in for some front end noise, broken struts, control arms, and some motor mounts. The first time I picked up my vehicle after $2,100 of work ( keep in mind this is after we talked them down on the price because their origin estimate was completely price gauged) the noises from the front struts were still there. They said they needed to buy another part ( on the house) to make a different noise stop. So, I took it back a week later to get that part installed. After picking it up, now my whole front end shakes, the control arm and axle is clicking and the car shakes when I brake. All new problems going on . Now there are multiple things wrong with the car that weren't wrong before. So, I take it in for a third time, they keep it overnight to hear some concerns I have about the noises that happen mostly in the morning, and they test drive it and agree that the noises are still bad and sound like faulty parts. At this time; third time I've dropped off my car, they say that they are out of answers and I need to take it to another location that can help better with foreign cars. In the meantime, it's now Christmas Eve, and I'm 39 weeks pregnant out $2,100 on a car that runs worse than when I took it in. I am very upset that they can leave a customers car like this without answers. I will be taking my car to the other location and I will give that location the chance to get it right. However, I feel like it's not even safe to drive my car with my children in it. If I could go back in time, I would have stopped by Yelp and read the reviews about this place before bringing my car here. They are going to make it right for me and my family or I am getting a full refund to take it somewhere else. Please take your vehicle elsewhere if you don't want to be out a ton of money with addition issues to your car. I will consider taking his review down if they fix the problem.  I have videos recording the sounds that are taking place and how they are progressively getting worse each time I bring my car in. Very upsetting. Not okay.

I joined this location in January of 2012. A couple of my friends brought me in as a guest to try it out since I was looking for something great for my family as well as a clean environment with good equipment. I loved it right away and joined! This gym has far exceeded my expectations. The front desk, kid club attendants, trainers and management all have superb customer service. Even the maintenance staff is friendly. When I come in with my two daughters, the front desk is always smiling and friendly to my kids as well and that is important to me because if my kids like coming to the gym, then mommy can get into the gym no problem.:) the overall atmosphere is great and the other members are friendly. I come to the gym 5-7 days a week and I have not lost motivation yet. I always want to come in:) thank you mountainside Gilbert for helping me achieve my fitness goals and for making this a great place for my kids to play while I workout.

Disapointing. Please go elsewhere if you are expecting!!  I was a patient here when i was pregnant with my second daughter in 2009.  I had a great experience with the doctors and staff.  I didnt pay much attention to the fact that i had a different doctor see me each visit for my whole 9 months  because each doctor was personable and knowledgable.   Currently, I am pregnant with my third baby and i went back to Valley Women for Women at 4 weeks pregnant. At this time, i saw a nurse practicioner my first visit. ( my insurance gets billed for me to see a doctor) My second visit they had my paperwork completely messed up in their system, telling me i had marked i had a few certain health issues... that i DO NOT have. So, clearly they mixed up my paper work with someone elses. That is very concerning. I had another visit with them for my 12 week appt., at that time i had a few concerns and was waiting for days for the doctor to even get back to me about the results. it just seems sad that us women who go here are just a "number" to this practice. They give you a different doctor each visit and its very impersonal. Not to mention the front desk is very rude and loud about how much you owe them. They asked me to pay a bill that i had not even recieved yet in the mail! ( they said it was mailed the day before, i said i would wait to pay when i actually got to look it over)   here is another concerning story:  As i was waiting for my 8 week appt, a lady ran out of the office in a hurry, shaking her head. I asked her what was wrong. She told me " do not go here, you should leave now". I asked "why"?. She said she went into the doctor for a lump in her breast and the "doctor" repeatedly asked her if she had breast implants, that the lump felt like an implant. The patient kept telling the "doctor" that she does NOT have implants and is very concerned about the lump in her breast. After a few minutes of arguing, the patient stormed out of the office and that is when she ran into me and told me her story. That is very scary. I hope she found a doctor elsewhere to help her.  I hope you all read this review and choose a different place to take care of you.  I just had enough and i finally switched doctors. i found a WONDERFUL doctor in Gilbert that will PERSONALLY see me EVERY visit. I call in and ask questions and i talk to HIS nurse. He will be the doctor that DELIVERS my baby. Now that is how it should be in the medical industry. Your health and your babies health is SO important and you need to put it in the hands of professionals that care and know what they are doing.

We all had a blast. It gets better every year. I enjoyed the VIP tent with nice shade and AC in the restrooms!! The food was good and the drinks were cold. Great event! Love going every year.

Never have been here for brunch before this past Sunday.  We enjoyed ourselves on the patio with our kids, and the food was delicious. I am happy we stopped in!

Just visited Snooze for the first time today with my work team for breakfast. I would say that the atmosphere, food, and friendliness of the staff is super! But, we sat outside and there are no fans or misters. We asked if they had anything they can turn on ( because we are all hot and sweaty), and they said they like to preserve energy so they do not have either.  In Arizona, when it is 100 degrees by 9am and you offer outdoor seating, I think you should offer misters or fans. I understand and appreciate the thought of preserving energy and water, but when you are only open till mid afternoon, you wont have to run them as long as other businesses that are open all day long and can still be energy efficient.  We were all dripping sweat by the time breakfast was over. The food was good, and I will be back, but i will try to sit inside next time if the wait isnt too long. Glad they opened Snooze here in Gilbert. Gilbert is where it's at!

I was a patient here years ago. I had a terrible experience with the nurses not calling me back with my results and being rude when i asked questions. I decided to leave a review today because i keep hearing from others that they also are having bad experiences here as well. its a shame, location is great, service and overall atmosphere is poor. go elsewhere.
