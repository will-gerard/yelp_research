Oregano's is always a great call! I could eat there every meal, every day of the week....but try to do so sparingly because of the downfall for my diet. The prices are not bad at all and they have 1/2 portions for everyone's appetite. If you are in a hurry...they also do very efficient takeout orders. Also, the servers are always very animated and helpful. Thanks Oregano's for many years and many great meals!

My date and I attended the IB Anderson's Nutcracker last night.  I hadn't seen the Nutcracker since I was a little ballerina girl.  It was an absolutely AMAZING performance with stunning set changes.  The dancers were incredible and very fun to watch!  I would recommend this event to people of all ages as a "Must see".

My husband and I stopped for a quick bite to eat.  My "medium" Maui Burger was overcooked not once but twice...which is not a big deal.  The bartender and manager really went the extra mile to take care of us!  Not only did they comp the burger from our bill, but gave us an Islands gift card to go back another time with.  - I have never experienced such a generous make-up for a couple of small kitchen errors. - We will definitely go back because the staff made such a valiant effort to make it right.   Now if only they'd make their burgers big again....but that's a different review :)

My husband and I love going to the movies!  Doesn't really even matter which movie :)  We frequent this Theatre as it is so close to home.  The staff is always polite, helpful, and witty - making it fun!  Also, we invest in the souvenir cups and pop corn shirts each year to save a bundle.

I have been going to this Vet and Mayo Location for 3+ years with our hypochondriac white boxer.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating to our needs on every visit.  They have a great bedside manner with our dog-child.  I would like to give a special shout-out to Ashley at the front desk....she has been a blessing on many occasions!  I would highly recommend getting the Banfield Pet Insurance.  It has literally saved us thousands of dollars and she can be seen anytime without a charge for an "office visit".  My only slight complaint (and I understand they are treating an animal, so figuring out symptoms verses treatment is difficult) is that the wide range of tests that the Doctor's suggest will usually be hundreds of dollars each visit, even above what the highest insurance plan covers or discounts.  I have to be very careful what I authorize and allow the staff to do as to treat the pup's ailments one thing at a time.

Had a great experience rehabbing from a car accident injury.....Paul and David (the PT Team at Scottsdale) took great care of me and helped me get back in working order in only 6 weeks.  The equipment was top notch at the gym, amenities were nice, and location was very close to home.

The Doctor and most of his staff were very nice and thorough I believe. I had a bit of a tiff with one of the staff ladies when my bank card was charged twice and she got snippy with me that "she didn't do that" (although my bank verified that it charged twice). Coming in with a background of being in "customer service" it was in very bad taste on her part. I don't know if I would recommend the office as my friends, family, and I only like to work with medical offices that have the best of service.

We got married at Sassi in November 2012 and it was the best experience!  The staff was very helpful and knew exactly what they were doing.  The setting of this restauant/event center is as beautiful as it gets....overlooking the entire city and set in the perfect desert landscape snuggled up to Pinnacle Peak.  This is the best setting for a romantic night or entertaining friends/family.  - - And the food is absolutely to die for!  We still get complements on the wedding dinner!  Thanks Sassi!!!

If you want the Snobby Scottsdale experience, then maybe this is the place for you.  My husband and I were going to host a rehearsal dinner for our wedding at the Princess for more than 50 out of town guests, but our generous budget of several thousand dollars for appetizers and drinks that we had requested the event planner to stick to, was "beneath" for the Chef at La Hacienda.  Really unfortunate because we would have liked our guests to have seen such a lovely resort for possible visits in the future.  However, with the inflexibility and rudeness of the staff - they lost not only ours but all of our guests business as well.  There's plenty of great resorts and restaurants in North Scottsdale....I would pick any place else before we would ever consider going back to the Princess' or its restaurants.

Scottsdale Jean Company shopping was a wonderful experience. Lauren, the sales gal, helped me get a couple of Awesome jeans. If you are looking for a nice pair of designer jeans (and **bonus** in-store tailoring), this is your place. The only thing that would make this store 5-stars...would be longer hours. Their current hours are M-F 10-6, Sa & Su 10-5....that's shorter than most "banker hours".

Great Sushi...best I've had in Phoenix.  The cost was fairly significant, but the taste was worth it.  The service also left something to be desired (even sitting at the bar).  I'd go back again on a special occasion.

Went to City Hall for the first time last night....it was a GREAT time. Good experience, good service, beautiful facility, live music, and the food....oh - the yummy food! It was so good, someone stole a friend's leftovers from the patio when they walked away for a minute.  - I would definitely go back :)

Estate House was a good time.  They had a live band on Saturday night.  I enjoyed a bottle of wine with friends and a beautiful overlook of the Scottsdale canal.  There were not a lot of people (probably because the music was a bit too loud - does that make me old?).  However, for a private time in a nice setting - I'd recommend the venue to anyone around.  The service was very nice too (very attentive).  - I haven't had a chance to try the restaurant, but the bar setting was a lovely lounge :)

This place is "tops" when it comes to quality and service!  Located right next to the movie theater at Scottsdale and 101, they are very understanding when you have a movie to make and will even store your leftovers in the fridge for when you leave the movie.  I was excited when my husband and I asked the waiter "which pasta of yours should we try"....his response (in a thick Italian Accent) was "oh, not on the menu", asked us a few questions, and returned with a pasta dish from heaven - all made from scratch I'm positive.  Definitely one of the best restaurants in the area....try and enjoy anytime - you won't be sorry!

What a great restaurant....posh decorating, helpful/friendly staff, and very good food. I have tried several of their rolls - the Lobster roll is the best! If you are in the area or passing by, definitely stop at Ebisu!

Great selection of wine and beer! Beats the heck out of Bevmo or any other liquor store I've been to. I have been back several times...a bottle of wine is becoming my token gift when attending parties or events. The wine is well organized and easy to find if you're looking for something specific. If you are not sure what you'd like, the staff is very helpful and the labels will spell out for you which wines are the most popular.

This was a great place. Good service with Mick at the bar and good food too! The atmosphere and ambiance were fantastic. Even though the concepts are very similar, I would dare to say they are better than Houston's. We had a very nice late lunch and I would definitely go back.

This restaurant/bar was a bit confusing when we walked in, but ended up as a great experience.  Once we understood the story behind the bar it made great sense....Hanny's was a department store in downtown Phoenix.  The owners of AZ 88 bought the failing store and redesigned it as a posh restaurant/bar/lounge.  The decor was very simple, but worked with the flow of the classic store magnificently.  Also, the food was unexpectedly very good - try the BLT.

Blanco was very good. It was hoppin on a Friday night, unlike many of the other restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix in this economy. The menu is a bit limited, but they do great with the Mexican style dishes (like tacos and cheesy dips) that they do offer. Our service at the bar was fantastic and the Margaritas were delicious :)

This is a great store and the service is spectacular. I purchased several workout/lounging outfits from them because the sales people were so great - thanks Heather! The quality and fit of the clothes is ideal for yoga, gym, or simply relaxing. They also do in-store tailoring for free. I will definitely go back again and again for new gear.

With all the H&M hype, I thought the place was Eh...Ok. The styles are very European (especially the horrific shoes). For basics sweaters, leggings, shirts - they were inexpensive and a good place to go. The parking and lighting in the store were not good or helpful. Also, the staff was rather cold, unhelpful, and snobby. Give it a try - but be warned that it's a lot of hype without the stars to back it up.

I had never been to this store's location in Scottsdale before Saturday. I have frequented the Biltmore location (and I'm a HUGE fan of their store & clothes). However, I will NEVER go back to the Bogota location because of the service/staff. The only people in the store who were getting good service or help were the snotty sales girl's friends. Not only were they unhelpful, but the sales girl actually insulted me to my face ("YOU're a size 2?" - YES, actually I am).....I walked out and went to the Biltmore location to spend several hundred dollars.   I am a big supporter of luluemon's products and store....but avoid the Bogota location if you want any service or a good selection.

This is a great new place. Their red sauce and meatballs are to die for. The staff is also great - they kept the restaurant open extra time after close just to allow me to pickup takeout and then carried it to my car :) WOW! I'll defiantly go back soon. Thanks Meatballz

Met a friend for happy hour last night at Stingray Sushi Biltmore...we had a nice night! The place was busy for happy hour so we sat at the bar outside under the misters. The bartenders (3) were very attentive. Our food (3 rolls) was good but I wish they were able to do brown rice (oh well - still good though). Pricing on HH was pretty inexpensive too. - I would definitely go back.

Fantastic burgers and fries!  After weeks of dieting this custom burger melted in my mouth.  Delicious and wonderfully greasy!  The fries were a very large portion...be sure to split with your date :)

This is MY nail salon!  I usually make an appointment to see Tracy (the owner and head lady).  She is very sweet and accomidating, plus I think she does the best gel nails I have ever found!  The other staff is very friendly and do good jobs as well.  I even brought my bridal party in last year prior to our wedding.  We were able to bring champagne and sparkling cider with snacks while the ladies got their nails done for the big event. I would highly recommend this nail studio!  The cost is comperable and I have found often less than other nail places in the aread.

This is a great local restaurant - walking/biking distance from home. The service, food/drinks, and ambiance make it the perfect spot for meeting a group of friends to a nice date night. My only wish is that they would be open later...just in case we need food anywhere in Grayhawk after 10.

Went for a visit with my cousin over the weekend and we are always in search of healthy places to eat.  They were not very busy, but possibly because of the early dinner we opted for (4:30pm).  The food was pretty good, not over the moon, but good - we both had salads.  The service was very good, we had a bartender wait on our table and she was very attentive.  I would go back here to meet friends for another visit.

I have tried to use this place twice....one purse handle repair on an expensive handbag - turned out awful with peeling edges and black glue all over.  I sent it back to them but the owner assured me that it was the purse and not the repair work. Because this place is nearby my work and I was new to the area, I decided to give them one more try.  The second chance was a bad idea!  This time the owner was even ruder than before and absolutely ruined my wedding shoes.   He attempted to dye them royal blue (which he did on a sample and said it would be fine) and they turned out an uneven periwinkle - horrible!  Luckily the shoe store (Dillards at Fashion Square - Thanks Jason) took them back.  Bad dye job and all!  Please save yourself the anguish and use anyone else for repairs or dyes of any kind!!

Absolutely love this Hair Salon and wholeheartedly agree that Jinia is the BEST!  I live in North Scottsdale (almost Cave Creek Area) and the drive to Chandler is well worth the expertise and quality!  Jinia did every person's hair for our wedding last year & the party the night before - and for both events, everyone's hair was flawless!! The salon itself is artsy, homey, and comfortable, without being overpriced.  They also offer classes for clients for free to learn new styles or tools and how to use them!

I was really skeptical going in to have Acupuncture for the first time...but after having a pressure headache for over a week - I would have tried about anything to feel better. My appointment went great! I was rid of my headache a short time after my session.  Perry Cooper is really talented, has great patient interaction, and has a wealth of knowledge on all things eastern medicine and holistic! I never realized you can use acupuncture to treat all kinds of ailments - bloody noses, stress, pain, girl stuff...the list goes on! Oh, and did I mention that they take insurance, payments from HSA, and have later hours for working stiffs. I would definitely recommend trying acupuncture @blueserenity.

Watched the ASU game here with friends on Saturday.....and I remember "Sneakers" that this was previously.  Really liked the "Spokes" theme - Bicycles are so in right now and there was done of fun people watching as Tempe had its Tour De Fat that day!  The food here was very good, beer selection was great, pricing was reasonable, and service staff was solid!

My husband and I found this jem on the Yelp search for BBQ. We try to eat healthy most days but allow ourselves one meal we've been craving on Sundays. Oh boy did we hit the jackpot with Bootleggers Food & Drinks! From their home made moonshine, to the bacon board appetizer (yes, I said BACON BOARD), to the ribs & pulled pork sandwich entrees - we were both in hog heaven - pun intended. The food & drink were great! The location is in a small strip mall on the SE corner of Shea and the 51. Formerly the location was a Dirty Drummer and I am told - quite a dive. However, the modern-rustic hip decor was super sleek!  And couple all of that with spectacular service...we will definitely be back and next time with friends in tow!

Went to The Habit with my husband & sister  after a movie one night. Their hours were good...open till 10pm (I think) and the staff was very helpful & friendly.  The food was good...hard to stand out & have the BEST burger in the area with so much excellent competition so close.  I would recommend the sweet potato fries instead of regular fries   Also, I tried to go there for lunch Friday but the line was out the door & around the building....so they must be doing something right!

Minus one star!! --- Tried a new place...save your money & calories. The food had absolutely no flavor, sauce, or taste - it was an absolute disgrace to the Philadelphia Cheese Steak Sandwich. I bought and took home to my family, but when I called to tell the staff We were all very unhappy with the lack of taste.....They said that "because I hadn't eaten the food at the restaurant, they wouldn't return my money" - NOW that's horrible customer service for you. We even tried to add our own flavor to the sandwiches but couldn't fix the flat flavor failures.  Please avoid this place at all cost! There's lots of better options in the area.
