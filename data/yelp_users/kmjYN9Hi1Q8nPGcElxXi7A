When it comes to eating at restaurants owned by famous chefs there is a chance of being let down. Maybe it's the high expectations, the even higher prices, or just the wait that comes with going to a high profile restaurant.  I'm pleased to say that this time the experience matched the expectations and I had one of the best meals I have had in years.   My mother is in town from Oklahoma and we sat on the patio and with the weather starting to cool was great. There was a fire pit, many torches, and a guy playing acoustic guitar which set a nice relaxing atmosphere.   We had the bento box, and the California roll for appetizers. the roll was good and the crab meat was fresh. but the bento box was great. It has braised short ribs, pot stickers, a couple pieces of spicy tuna roll and shrimp skewers. The ribs had a nice balance of teriyaki and smoke and came right off the bone and were delicious.   My mom got the butter fish and I had the Roy's trio which had butter fish, salmon, and tuna. All three fish were excellent and well seasoned but that butter fish was amazing. It was my first time to have the fish and it was buttery, had zero fishy taste and was just delicious.   for dessert we shared the blueberry tart with lavender ice cream. Again, just great. the blueberries were ripe, the ice cream was creamy and refreshing, and the presentation was superb.   in conclusion, i have nothing bad to say about Roy's. I think if I had to use a word to describe the food it would be balance. Everything plays well off of each other.   My mother said it was the best meal she has had in years and I have to agree. The bar was set high, but Roy's knocked it out of the park.

THE BEST BAR IN SCOTTSDALE. Yes i said it. Great staff that is super fun and arent afraid to party. You have a stripper pole that gets more action then paris hilton, great music on the jukebox (especially if oyu want some journey in your life.) and last but not least the wheel. You should fear the wheel because the wheel owns all. You will find people from all walks of life at giligans and you never have that stuck vibe you find at most Scottsdale establishments. This is a must for all local in the Phoenix area.

Had a great dinner last night at elements. My girlfriend and I shared two appetizers, the pot stickers and calamari then also shared some short ribs and the sticky rice. Everything was cooked well and has good flavor and balance. Short ribs fell apart and melted in the mouth. Very enjoyable experience and would recommend for any special occasion.

this is by far my favorite lunch spot in the valley. The fact that it also is a grocery store only adds to its charm. All the ingredients are fresh and the servings are big. I reccomend the itialian sausage and there cold chicken pasta is wonderful. Highly reccomended for anyone who wants a nice little lunch spot. be warned though, wait times can be very long. If your willing to wait though this is a great spot.

this was the first restaurant I decided to go too based on my fellow Yelpers, and I thank god I listened to them.   You barely notice Los Sombreros from the road, but don't let that fool you. This place has a great little patio with a super friendly staff and great margaritas. Couple that with the best guacamole in the Valley and great dishes like there enchiladas de pollo this is a cant beat place. Great for a chill happy hour.   why are you still here? go!....NOW!!!

Been a while since i have written a review but I love to get the word out on good places to eat in the valley and Meatballz is a great lunch place. You can get chicken parm with a couple garlic knots and a drink for 10 bucks which is a great deal. The sauce is great, portions big, and the staff is nice.   The owner is a great guy who talks to everyone in the restaurant and really makes u feel at home.   If you like fast, inexpensive, good italian then this is the place to go.

I have heard so much of this little cookie shop that I had to make the trek from North Scottsdale to see what the fuss is about.   I don't like cupcakes but got the orange blossom just to try and i still couldn't get into it so I wont hold that against them. What I went for was the oatmeal raisin cookies. These cookies were pretty good but not nearly as soft or as chewy as I would of liked. I think they might of been even a little bit old? I dunno, the flavors are all there though so I would like to go back and try again some time. I saved a few cookies for the next day and they were hard as a rock so I think i got the tail end of a batch or something.   The berry muffin was fantastic. Great balance of tartness and sweet, tons of berries, soft, fluffy, really good.   The thing that really stood out for me was the morning buns. These are a buttery croissant with orange zest, cinnamon, and sugar and completely changed my view of cinnamon roles. These were light and fluffy and had a nice crust formed by the sugar so a flaky crunch when you bit into it and then it was gloriously buttery and soft in the middle and when you take a bit you taste the cinnamon and sugar but then come the orange zest and buttery flavor and man...it was good. I could eat these every day all day.   So in short, i came for the oatmeal cookies which left me a little 'meh' but will come back for the morning buns which are now one of my favorite pastries.

I went to Chloe's Corner yesterday for lunch in Kierland and couldn't of been more impressed. The atmosphere is a throw back to my childhood in Oklahoma where you came and parked ur behind at the counter but with a modern twist without trying to be too trendy.    I talked to the manager and he told me it used to be a fox restaurant but the owner, his sister who worked for Fox bought them out when they no longer wanted to won the place and she took it over herself and tweaked the menu. I thought it was very cool that Chloe's went from a corporate place to a locally owned one.   So onto the important stuff. The food. I ordered a grilled cheese and it was one of the best grilled cheeses I have had in a very long time. What I love about this sandwich is that they are not trying to "update" or "modernize" it. They took some fresh white bread and buttered it up then placed thick slices Cheddar, Swiss, and White American on top with a thick cut of juicy bacon and a tomato. When I bit into it cheese oozed out and you would get that rich taste of the cheese, the freshness of the tomato and the right amount of saltiness and crunch from the bacon. It tasted so good it felt like I was eating in slow motion. I might have to go there again today because it was so dang good.  One of my favorite things in the world are oatmeal raisin cookies and they had some oatmeal dark cherry cookies that I had to try and these were fantastic as well. The cookie was big, dense, and soft just how I like them and when you bite into it the cookie melted sweet goodness and just when you think its getting a little too sweet the tartness of the cherry hit and really brought it all together.   If your in the Kierland area anytime soon I highly recommend Chloe's. I certainly will be going back very soon.

It has been a long time since I have posted a review on Yelp. That's because its been a long time since i have felt passionately enough about a dining experience one way or another to throw my proverbial 2 cents in. Unfortunately Stax was such a horrible experience that I had to yelp about it.    I don't know if it was just because of the open patio or what, but we sat inside and there were flies and moths all over the place. I just hope the kitchen isn't some nightmare that i would see on a Gordon Ramsey show.   the menu looks promising with several different style of burgers ranging from the mundane to the exotic, sides and different aoli's (which is really mayo just mixed with something else and put into a cup). The thing that really bothered me is that there are no regular french fries. Call me old fashioned, but i love french fries and don't understand this decision.   I got both styles of beef burgers and the meat was overcooked, dry, and the food took over an hour to get out. they also forgot our sweet potato fries and onion rings and those took another 15 minutes to get out. Needless to say the service was terrible. The waitress didn't even know what deserts they had, she had to look at a menu....  To sum it up, horrible service, terrible food, and extremely overpriced. The only people I could see liking this place are people who like to be scene but if your looking for a good burger you will do yourself a favor to go someplace else.

I have been eating here for about 3 years and there is one thing that keeps bringing me back. The Tinga Taco.   The tinga is the single best taco I have ever had. Shredded marinated chicken thrown into a crispy shell then the whole thing deep fried. Throw in there fantastic chips and salsas and you got my favorite place to go in the valley for tacos.

I have been to the Parlor twice and one time it was so/so and the other it was one of the best pizza experiences I have had. Talking to others it seems like they have had similar hit and miss experiences there. That being said I will always chase that experience and keep going back. Hopefully the pizza's get a tad more consistent. Oh, and the duck confit? amazing.

Update: just went here tonight with my friends and the food was great, but the pizzas took forever. We never said a word yet the manager came and apologized and offered us a free dessert. Then the checks took forever and it ended up being a 2 hour dinner. The manager came over again and apologized and comped our entire meal and gave us a $25.00 gift certificate. Talk about customer service! What a great way to treat clients! Besides the long dinner the food was excellent. Their duck confit appetizer and little apple fritter dessert are both out of this world excellent. Will be definitely going back soon.

25 degrees has become my go to burger joint in town. I love the decor of this place which has a old school yet modern feel that isn't trying to hard to be trendy like some of the other gourmet burger places in town.   The Fries are good but not great IMO. I know that rosemary is a big trend now with fries but to me its a little overpowering but i must say that there onion rings are the best i have had in town. there big, golden brown, and dont fall apart on you. They have a great texture and the breading is lighter then other batters but still gives you a great crunch. I have yet to try the sweet potato fries here but I have only heard good things.   The burgers are the real deal here folks. They have just the right amount of fat content in the meat and a big. It is hard to get a consistent medium rare burger at places when the patty's are so big but they always hit it on the head. I believe the buns are made in house and they are fluffy and a tad sweet which I like. When i'm here I usually go for a bacon grilled onion burger with Gruyere cheese and can't seem to stay away.   The service has always been top notch and being from Oklahoma I love soda and this place has the best Coke I have had in Arizona and there root beer is homemade, on tap and tastes absolutely unbelievable.   If you are ever in City North you should definitely check this place out.

I went here and got the chicken fried chicken and waffle wanting some good ole southern comfort food for breakfast. Boy was I shocked when a tiny, thin, breaded piece of chicken came on a over cooked flat waffle. I swear this was a large frozen chicken mcnugget on a plate.   The service was good and the decor was nice but this was easily the worst breakfast I have ever had at a restaurant. I will never go here again.

Friday afternoon and I showed up at 2 and there was a sign on the door saying "will return at 2". Figured they would show up any minute so I waited. 30 minutes later of sitting in the hot AZ sun and still nobody.  If you are gonna run a business you shouldn't least try and  be professional. This is just absolutely ridiculous.

So happy there is now a location by my house! Best Nachos in town with there large round tortilla chips covered in shredded pork, beans, cheese, and slices of fresh jalapeno. The Fajitas are amazing as well. If i had to describe there sausage/steak fajitas it's like fajitas combined with the best sausage and peppers from chicago combined and wrapped in tortillas. They have a slight sweetness to them which is refreshingly different then most fajitas in town. Couple that with great food, nice atmosphere and impeccable service and you have one of the best dining experience in Nor-Dale. (North Scottsdale)

Like football there are 3 phases to a good restaurant. Good food, good service, and good drinks. Citizens public house is one of those places that does all 3 phases exceptionally well.   I have eaten here numerous times and the service is always up to par. Knowledgable staff who isn't afraid to suggest dishes or drinks and will be attentive through the duration of your meal.   The drinks are some of the best in the valley. If you are being really adventurous try the speakeasy style bar upstairs where thy will turn vodka into gin table side. It's a pretty great experience.   Finally and most importantly, the food is outstanding. You have to try the pork pastrami which is a deconstructed version of the sandwich with succulent pork belly, sauerkraut and spaetzle. The truffled grilled cheese is amazing layered with gooey cheese and potatoes. Do yourself a favor and add bacon which really takes this sandwich to the next level adding texture and some needed salt. Keeping on the pork them their short ribs are also outstanding.   All the deserts are made by Tracey Dempsey and are delicious. You really can't go wrong with anyone of them, but if your full take a bag of the bacon pecan brittle home. You won't regret it.

I don't know if it's because pork belly is relatively new to the food scene in Phoenix, but some local restaurants think they can get away calling what they serve "pork belly" but in reality is just your standard pork butt or loin. That's the case with hey joe.   False advertising is exactly what you get at this food truck that tries to sell off regular dark pork meat as pork belly. I bought the pork belly bun sandwich which again, not pork belly and even putting that aside there just was no flavor. I wish I would of doused it in Hot sauce. The bun was nice and the meat was cooked well but between no flavor and being served pork that wasn't pork belly I can't recommend this place to anyone.

Being from Oklahoma I crave BBQ. It's one of my favorite things, yet I Have found it really hard to find good BBQ in Phoenix. When I heard about Tom thumbs market I was excited to try it hoping that my passion for pork would be met. Sadly, I had a bad experience with the food. My brisket was so dry that it was turning grey.....  I had some pulled pork as well and it was not quite as dry as the brisket but still not juicy or smokey and lacked flavor. The sauces were good, really enjoyed the Carolina sauce and they had a real good chocolate chip cookie. When it came to the sides I would recommend the cole slaw. It was a lighter vinegar based slaw with lots of flavor.   With all the positive reviews and from what I heard from other friends it seems as though I maybe was there on a bad day. Maybe I will try again some other time down the road but for now I just couldn't recommend this place to anyone

Came here late Saturday night for the first time to get a pizza to go. Bartender was extremely rude and I had to flag down another bartender to finally put my order in. Took over 30 minutes to get my pizza when they weren't crowded and people who came after me where getting there food one by one. So long story short, the service was awful.   Now the pizza. I got whatever they call their works and the other half was a chorizo style. I felt like the pizza is just a half step above ur average delivery pizza like papa johns. The crust was limp, sauce was too sweet, and the toppings weren't that fresh.   If the service was even adequate I would give them 3 stars. Like I said, it's a step above delivery pizza, not bad. But with that kind of service I will never go again.

I took my girlfriend to Steak 44 for a welcome home dinner as she had been away for a week and was really hoping that the restaurant would live up to the reviews I had seen but unfortunately I had a not so great experience.   First the atmosphere was off. They stuck us at a table that had a speaker directly over it blasting all sorts of different music which made it almost impossible to talk without yelling. The restaurant was so dark that multiple people had to use their iphone flash lights to read the menu which is not only annoying, but also distracting when you are getting blinded by another persons flashlight.   The service was a mixture of both good and bad. Our waiter was down right terrible. MY girlfriend and I rarely drink and when we said we wanted just water and a ginger ale his eyes glazed over and he was done with us, you could tell right away. I asked him if there was any specials and he said "nope, we have our menu." Never explained the menu and only stopped by once during our meal to ask us how our food was before we even took a bite. There was a table of 6 next to us who ordered wine and he was more then happy to go over the menu and be polite and attentive. The only thing that helped save the service were the 2 bus boys who kept on top of everything all night and were extremely polite and kind.   Now to the food. I will say this, Steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly, obviously at a steak house that is important. We ordered two apps the pork belly and the meatballs. Meatballs were delicious and a big serving, they were juicy and fried on the outside and the marinara had a good tangy flavor. The pork belly was way over cooked which gave it a hard chewy texture. It was also very lean for pork belly. For sides we got the spinach and brussel sprouts. Spinach was just steamed and unseasoned which is something that could of been done easily at home. The brussel sprouts were okay. They had bits of bacon, drizzled in olive oil, and I believe a little horse radish for a bit of a kick.   Long story short, over priced, food was a mixed bad, terrible service and ambiance. I wouldn't recommend.

So long story short I wrote that bootleggers had potential but missed the mark. The restaurant had just open and I wanted to wait and give it a second chance.   Well I'm pleased to say that I came back and came away very impressed. The apple moonshine is one of the best drinks in town. Notes of apple and cinnamon come together for a fantastic cocktail. We ordered the bacon board, nachos, chicken wings, and Mac and cheese and all were really good. Wings were grilled and had a smokey flavor and were hot but not over bearing. The nachos had some great guacamole and the brisket was cooked well. The bacon board was amazing. There wasn't only 3 very distinguishable bacons, but delicous pork belly and pork confit all served with home made jams, mustard, and cheese bread. Everything was cooked well and very appetizing.   I'm glad I gave bootleggers a second chance and love that we have a new good restaurant in the north Scottsdale area.

This place is just fun. From the different and varied combinations they throw out there, the flat bread that will make You never want a bun again, to the great sausages this place is a blast.   I had the bear which had peanut butter, cracker jacks, and BBQ sauce and it was a great hot dog. The tangy BBQ and the peanut butter worked well together and the cracker jacks added some needed texture.   If your looking for something fun ad delicious I would check out short leash
