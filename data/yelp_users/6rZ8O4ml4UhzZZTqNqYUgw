The Vibe: Contemporary, colorful with a bit of traditional crispness thrown in for good measure.  The Service: The hostess was cool although we had reservations. She suggested we wait while our booth was being prepared... but never told or showed us where to sit. I got the impression she was irritated. Oh well...  Our server seemed very green and didn't seem to know much about the food and even less about the wine. That's always a bummer. But she was extremely warm and friendly. Too bad we didn't really see much of her and other people (including the [gasp!] owner) had to bring us drinks, clear our table (we sat with empty plates in front of us for almost 10 minutes) and bring the dessert tray.  The Food: As a (sometimes) vegetarian, it can be a challenge to scour the town for delicious and meat-free dishes. Bobby's had "Vegetarian Paella" which caught my eye. Thankfully, our server knew enough about the menu to tell me that it contains chicken broth. Why anyone would advertise something as "vegetarian" and then use chicken broth to make it is beyond me. I went with the pasta purses instead. I wasn't disappointed. The basil sauce was divine and the tender, cheese-filled purses were incredible. A large, well-seasoned portobello mushroom cap was the center of the plate and the meal. It was so good I could have made a meal out of a few of those in the basil sauce, no pasta necessary.  My friend chose the nine-ounce filet with Roberto sauce (sauteed mushrooms and onions). He had to send it back as it was not cooked to order, but it was perfect on the second try. He said it was wonderful. He also ordered the broccolini and the gorgonzola mashed potatoes (also vegetarian, fyi). The broccolini was well-cooked, but cold by the time it reached. The potatoes were flavorful with a rustic, rough mash. For dessert, I had tiramisu and my friend chose the carrot cake. My tiramisu has a good flavor, but I could tell it had been made at least 3-4 days before, as it tasted of a refrigerator. The carrot cake was moist and delicious.  All in all, great experience. And the owner was warm and wonderful. I'll definitely go back soon!

Bella and I love this dog park! Lots of space and the doggie mommies and daddies are pretty good about watching and cleaning up after their kids...  The only thing I wish were different is there is ONE water fountain in the section we use. Needless to say, it's a hotspot and not the most tidy area in the park. I just hope all the kids have their shots because it gets pretty gross when you have 2-3 dogs lapping up water at the same time. LOL!  Plenty of shaded seating for parents, and plenty of shade for the pups when they tire themselves out. And the beauty of it? Your dog will never behave better than after a trip to the dog park, especially if he/she is the hyper type, like my Bella is. A tired dog is a good dog! Definitely go here!

Like a previous reviewer, I needed an affordable option. I'm new to the area and I needed a dentist here. The Valpak coupon was right on time... I take great care of my teeth and routine care was all I needed (cleaning, x-rays, etc...). At $49 with the coupon, who could say no?  I called Bonnie to make my appointment and she was as sweet as they come. When I arrived for my Saturday (yay!) appointment, Bonnie was just as wonderful and easy to work with in person as she had been over the phone. I didn't get feel at all like I was being treated as a second-rate customer because I was using the deal.  The office was small and older, but clean. No fancy frills that I had in my old dentist's office, but that wasn't important to me. The hygienist (I think it was Tanya) was a dream to work with. Thorough, knowledgeable and very personable. She answered all of my questions, worked quite methodically, and never made me feel like she was rushing through my appointment, which I appreciate in a dentist office these days where it can feel like quite the factory. She went over my x-rays with Dr. Chatterjee and me, answering whatever questions I had. When my cleaning was complete, Dr. Chatterjee came back into the examination room to go over everything. She, too, was very nice and thorough.  As far as I'm concerned, i have found my new dentist for as long as I'm in Arizona. And it only took one try. I love them!

A huge fan of Fox restaurants, I was beyond disappointed with my experience at NoRTH. My friends and I love dining out and Fox restaurants are always at the top of our list of places to go. During our recent visit to NoRTH, we started with the bruschetta (with asparagus and prosciutto) and the calamari salad. The bruschetta was tasty, but I simply could not stomach the salad. The arugula was limp and the calamari was 75 percent batter, 20 percent oil and a dash of seafood. It was clear the cooking oil had not been hot enough as the ringlets were soaked with grease. The dressing (which I, thankfully, ordered on the side) was both heavy and bland. Additional acidity (preferably fresh lemon juice) would have brightened the dressing and the salad (which should have been replaced with fresh greens), and the correct temp for the oil would have resulted in crisp, tender morsels of goodness. My friend ordered and enjoyed the pork tenderloin. But my scallops and risotto were undercooked, the former cold in the center, the latter crunchy and chewy, about 3-4 minutes ahead of al dente.  We wanted to enjoy a casual but fabulous dinner and we were looking forward to a lovely meal. I will always love the Fox brand and his amazing concepts, but to sum up this particular experience: #FAIL

It's six months later and I'm STILL traumatized... I shudder and snarl every single time I drive past it... Based on what I know to be the definition of "resort," they should absolutely change the name of this place.  I should have known something was awry when I was standing in the lobby to check in and the phone was just ringing. Over and over and over and over again while the person behind the desk ignored it. You couldn't at least answer and ask, "Can I please place you on hold?" Common courtesy, yes? That should have tipped me off... (Less than an hour later, I was on the other end of that equation, holding a filthy receiver near my ear, looking for hand sanitizer, waiting anxiously for someone to finally pick up.)  After providing my ID, cc, etc... to check in, the woman (amiable enough) handed me keys and a MAP of the "resort." I had quite a bit of luggage as well as my not-a-lapdog dog (and her crate) with me, so I asked if there was a bellman who might be able to help me. "Sure," the clerk said. "Pull your car up to the entrance and he'll be out." So I did as she instructed and waited for help. After 10+ minutes, nobody ever came and she never came out to tell me what was going on, to apologize, etc... Tired and just wanting to get dinner and rest, I decided to do it myself. Thankfully, I had only grabbed my dog and a few small bags when I made the first lonnnng, winding trek from the parking lot to my room. I have to say the grounds were quite nice and I was hopeful. But I could not believe my eyes when I opened the door of my "casita" (in this case, translated to "little house ready to be razed"). The odor that smacked me in the face (and my pup in the snout) was a combination of rank, stale and mold. The carpet was filthy. So filthy, in fact, that I wouldn't put my dog's toys on it, and my dog (like most) is gross and does odd things with her mouth. That should tell you how dirty the carpet was. The tile in the wet bar area and the bathroom was dirty as well. There were stains here, hair there, and dirt and grime everywhere. There was NO way that I was going to be able to go barefoot, sleep or eat in there. I couldn't even imagine showering in that bathroom, fearing what might become of me if the shower curtain from hell touched me.  I immediately pulled out my laptop so I could look up another place to stay. However, there were no visible networks. I called the front desk to figure out what was going on and (when someone finally answered) I was informed that they don't have wireless internet. What the...? I told her I would not sleep in that room, no way, no how... What did she do? Chuckle! I think she was chuckling because she knew those "casitas" are in awful condition.  Thankfully, I booked it through a third-party so I was able to switch hotels without too much trouble. The woman at the front desk of the hotel told me that I would have NOT been able to get any sort of refund if I had booked the room directly with them. Yeah, that would have been a problem...  In short: It. Was. Terrible!   I wouldn't recommend this hotel to an enemy, let alone a friend. Avoid at all costs!

Everything about my experience at Space was nothing short of bliss. From the warm reception to the time when I floated back to my car to head home for a night of peaceful, uninterrupted slumber, it was fabulous.  I first learned of Space via Groupon. I can't even remember how much I paid for it because I bought it so long ago. I've recently been dealing with lots of stress and the nasty side effects of it. So I decided to go see John for a 60-minute retreat. I was not disappointed.   The space that John has created and the energy that he exudes are calming, soothing and relaxing, even before you remove so much as your earrings... With warm, rich wood floors, soft lighting and a playlist that I simply must have, we were off to a fabulous start. John gave me a cool towel (which was lovely, as I have been battling a marathon migraine) and left me to disrobe. In the buff and ready for healing touch, I slipped into the cool sheets John had turned back for me on the table.  John returned to the room and homed in on my problem areas in a way that was both strong and soothing. We had already discussed my trouble spots and it was obvious that he used both that conversation and his naturally high sensitivity level to provide me one of the best massages I've ever had. By doing this, he was able to receive feedback from me without either of us uttering more than a few words, which ensured the trance was never broken. I was able to melt into nothingness, and for a little while, nothing else mattered. How amazing is that?  This is definitely a hidden gem in Greater Phoenix. You simply must go and treat yourself to an hour of bliss...

Any woman who has ever purchased on a dress online knows the nerve-wracking experience of sending your money to a company without really knowing whether or not you'll look like you belong on a red carpet or in a deli section with the rest of the sausages, replete with burst casings. But I digress...  I got the dress last weekend and it was satin and sumptuous. I put it on and... a tad snug in the hips and my girls are swimming in at the bust (and it's not like I'm exactly small up top). GREAT! And I only need to wear it... FRIDAY! I looked all over the place to find reliable and fast alteration shops. Then I remembered this little place because it's in a plaza about five minutes away from my job. What the heck? Besides, I didn't have time to drive all over Greater Phoenix in the hopes of finding someone to fix the mess that was my dress. I took the dress in to AZ Alterations Monday afternoon. It's a simple, tidy little shop and the woman who helped me was sweet and upfront. She told me they could fix the bust with no problem, but letting anything out in the hips would likely result in little holes in the satin, along the seam, from where the thread had originally been sewn. It wasn't worth the risk, so I asked her to just take in the bust. (Insert crash diet and body shaper here.) She told me it would be $45, since it would have to be a rush job, but that it would likely be done Wednesday, so we would have time to make any last-minute adjustments. A tad pricey, in my opinion, but I had to consider the type of material, the fact that she had to deal with the zipper and keep that straight, and that I needed it expedited.  As promised, she called me on Wednesday and I went right over to try on the dress. Not even the man who rammed his car into the side of mine as I was driving through the plaza could stop me! It slowed me down and required that I make an additional stop at a body shop and a rental car place right after I left AZ Alterations, but it didn't stop me!!! Yeah, that's right... *nodding slowly and raising my left eyebrow bad-assededly*  When I finally got there (after exchanging insurance information with my parking lot  archnemesis in the Mazda who clearly tried to ruin my afternoon... OK, he didn't really "try", but still...) and tried it on, it was still gapping a bit at the bust, so the seamstress said she would make an additional fix and that I could come back and get it before the store closed. Now the bust is a perfect fit. And even though I didn't bother to fuss with the hips for fear of jacked up result, that part fits great now, too, especially after not having any carbs since Monday, and buying the "almost life-threatening" level body shaper. All in all it was a great experience and the dress fits like a dream! Just be sure you watch out when you drive to get there because traffic in that plaza can be a nightmare.   FYI, the shop's business card says they do "alterations for men, women & children... casual, evening, wedding & much more." They also do dry cleaning.

In my opinion, the only things that might be more powerful than words are pictures. I think the going exchange rate is still 1/1000, right?  Amanda Marie creates pictures that truly are priceless. She captures moments in time without you realizing it, which results in amazing, candid and beautiful photographs. Her sweet, unassuming disposition belies her deft hand and gimlet eye. But the moment you look at the photos she has captured just for you, you realize how gifted Amanda Marie is. Her work is both thorough and simple, supple and traditional, all of which makes for photos which are the perfect blend of modern and classic.  If you're into the fake backgrounds and plastic poses for your engagement, wedding, family, etc... pictures, then you should by all means continue to go to those oversized photo booths at the malls and department stores and all of the self-proclaimed photographers out there. In fact, call me and I'll stop over with my point and shoot...  But if you want a professional photojournalist around while you create memories that are once-in-a-lifetime so that you have timeless pictures that will last forever, you should absolutely call Amanda Marie. She's incredible...
