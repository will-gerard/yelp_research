I contacted Layla via text after seeing all these great Yelp reviews and they were definitely right on! She was super easy to book with and these lashes turned out so great! I was trying them out for the first time and WOW, do they make a difference! Absolutely love the effect and the natural-looking lash material used. And they lasted longer than I expected!  Layla and her assistants are wonderful. Great conversation! Highly recommended! I will never go to anyone else now that I've experienced the best! :) Thanks Layla + girls!

I really enjoy that Allegiant offers flights to smaller cities, all my family lives in South Dakota, and just a few short years ago we would have had to fly into Denver and drive the rest of the way. Having Allegiant makes it a ton easier! However, a recent booking with Allegiant has left me with a bad taste.   We flew to Rapid City for a family emergency which has now resulted in my 26-year-old brother's death. I called Allegiant customer service in hopes they could help us extend our return flight for his services. We were scheduled to depart on Friday, but funeral arrangements were made for Monday, and I was not going to miss my little brother's funeral.   Aside being unsympathetic, the person assisting me could not find a way to help us extend our flight due to the unforeseen circumstance. After charging me an additional $400+ to make the itinerary change, I found online that to book a one-way trip was only $290. I am not sure where these additional expenses occurred, but I find it extremely unsettling that this person would find it appropriate to: 1.) give me a hassle for this request,  2.) charge well over the online price to make the change,  3.) offer no other solutions.   I asked to speak to a manager and was told me there was no one to speak to and that she was the highest authority at the time. I am absolutely disgusted by the way this issue was handled and think everyone should think twice about booking with Allegiant, the obviously don't care about people and their situations.

This place is amazing! Such great food and atmosphere. The server was so nice recommending her favorites and even bringing us a sample. You can not go wrong with any of the Mac and Cheese options - all so incredible! Pizza was really great too. So much delicious food! Can't wait to go back!
