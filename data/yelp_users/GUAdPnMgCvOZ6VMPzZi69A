Atmosphere - 4 service - 4 Food - 1 Value - 0  Very disappointed!!! Service was great and Matt was a great server. All the people at my table (8) agreed with my star value.  The potato tortilla was really good, but that's it... Just order a beer and tortillas.  We ordered the chicken Monterey, Build your tacos, along with green enchiladas.  Chicken Monterey was dry and lacked a lot of flavor. When I added the table salsa, it made it worse. The salsa was not pleasant and it tasted like it was made from a can stuff... I say stuff, because I want to keep it clean.  Build your tacos w/shrimp was really bad. The shrimp had no flavor along with the chicken and meat. The tortillas it came with, was a lower end tortilla (ghetto) and wasn't homemade. They have corn, flour, and potato tortillas..  Stick with the potato, but sure you ask for them in advance, because the cook can stop making them anytime.   The green enchiladas were ok.... They tasted a lot better than everything else... We all took a few bites and left our food... I told Matt I didn't want my food boxed, I just wanted a few more potato tortillas; however the cook stopped... I think the cooked stopped years ago. I wouldn't call him a cook... I would call him &$@&)...  Think twice before you go here... The whole table agreed, we all wouldn't go back.

Value - 5 Cleanliness - 5 Comfort - 5 Service - 5  I'm definitely looking forward to going back. The staff is great and the restart and bar is really good.   The golf course is beautiful and the drink cart is always insight to help with your swing.  Kudos to the resort staff!!!
