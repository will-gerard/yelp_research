First time here. Came early, so had to sit in saloon . Can't complain about bartender boy, he was respectful , got orders of my rattle snack with fried cactus. I went for swank to check out all place and outside. Yes, this place is super huge!!!!! Great for large parties, of course if you can afford. Quite expensive .

Cold Blue Moon is the best after shopping under 106 outside! Manuel's has bug bar.... Not many Mexican restaurants have bars. Nice menu ..... I need cold drink ONLY!

This place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit! Or they put eyes down like they didn't hear you! Really!!!! Took me over 1 hour to ask simple electronic wall hook up; meanwhile , I asked 5 reps just for "what row" to look !!! Suck place!!!!

Ok, I guess I am updating my review.... From 5 starts to 2 starts . I did not come to this place for over a year, due to un pleased last visit . However , there is always second chance. Well, too long to wait, new staff, only two waiters for huge place..... No happy hours ......

After reading all reviews, I have to say that it is a good place for a good food! Agree with Yelpers for decor - need to upgrade! But not agree with some Yelpers for salsa- it is unique taste & looks watery - I had the same taste in different mex places.... Just unique taste. YES! Carne Acada plate was delusionsssssssssss!

Super slow! Just in case if u will have Charlie server, better refuse his service & ask for another one..... Brought just drinks in 15 minutes.....I asked for extra plate...... Yes, he brought .... way AFTER I finished meal.... Really? But he immediately brought a bill! He knew he screwed up!!!  I had to edit review ..... He brought a bill , yes without a pen! Had to call near by server for a pen!

Unbelievable!!!!!! Instead of stay in line I stepped out side to get pocket change then wanted to step inside to ask banker question. He locked door just in from of my nose! That is a banking management and they want OUR money ????? He saw me waiting, and " ohhhh sorry it is after 6, I can't """ screw you"""" will bring my business to different place !!!! Yes, it is " A Welcome to Scottsdale"

Worst place ever! I did not stop in fast food places in ages. Decided to use restroom after shopping & get quesadilla . Girl was cleaning floor then smashed her nose , cleaned with her pants, then decided to take order..... I asked her to wash her hands first. She said Oh yeah, & went to restroom . Later took my order, just one quesadilla .... I had to wait it for 11-12 minutes.... Really?  Fast food????? Easier to stop in restaurant ! Place is sooooo dirty! Trash over filled .... I thru away quesadilla but left just a coke to drink...... Yucky!!!!

Decided to check out place... Bull riding nite. It was a cool evening . Not too many people. We went inside to get drinks. Waitress did not have an eye contact w me like I was invisible ! No smile, no answer on questions .... I looked on another waitresses - the same way! Managers need to train them to put as least a plastic smile! I asked about stage & bands.... She had noooooo any ideas! Wow!!!!! I felt pretty unwelcomed! After one drink, we left . I better give my money to place which will welcome me!

Well, I have to say that I am not fast food eater and I like to seat and read menu, and service of course . Stopped here right after celebration New Year, I was hungry. It looks like fast food, you must order at a counter, but full bar & serve to table. I ordered fajitas with two eggs in top, no problem! Food was soooooo delusionsssssssssss , eggs great, chicken great, veggies just right ... not over cooked , not undercooked! With margaritas! Let new year get started !!!!!!

Awesome team of guys !!!!!! Brandon Carl Keith and Steve are super! I would definitely recommend them for all your electronic needs. Steve was very pleasant to speak with, he knows the business, he respects and understands what we want and expect. He was keeping us informed and performed work  within scheduled proposal.  If I will decide any other project in future, LANZA will be my first choice! THANK YOU guys for all work!!!!

Staff pretty good, friendly... but management need update some parts , especially fountain drink area-disgusting looking. Doors around restroom and janitorial area- look so dirty.... Maybe it is clean , but appears dirty. $11 bucks for 1 hour, per kid..... Yeah , management should have money for updates ....

First time decided to check a new place. Ordered " Friday special" -Cod fish with cole claw and fried pickles. Pickles were under cooked with tooooo much flour . Cod nor seasoning at ALL!!!! Like eating raw soft potato. Cole slaw did not have ANY seasoning ..... I can make all that meal MUCH better! Will not be back!!!

First time here, for breakfast.... Was thinking to find something else besides IHOP & Denny's ..... Obviously this place need to call Robert Irvine! Smell old , look old , oily everything you touch .... I have a chance to try anyway because of " good yelp reviews" MISTAKE!!!! Server was sooooo rude, she needs to be "trained" of customer service speak abilities ..... I bet they did not see much nice dressed up people. Ok, food.... Home made potatoes were good, omelet sooooo plain! Do they have at least black pepper? Ok, 1 star for potato....

I gave this place one star only.....after being here 3 times. Guess patience is over. Yes, they have bar "menu", and everytime when I had to order , sorry we dont have so & so, sorry, we just out of so & so, REALLY? Take the freaking menu away!!!!!!! At first visit, I thought, S happens , at second time , out of XX, & wine & hot wings , at third time no even nachos  or any other food on Mother's Day , really??!!! Guess my money will find another welcomed place! Done with this shithole!!!!!

It is my first & last stop here ! They are horrible ! I ordered fry fish & Chopped steak, which should come with mushroom & steamed veggies ..... Yes, chopped steak they brought it was humbugger patty with horrible mushroom gravy and canned carrots ..... all food love for 10.95..... Really???? Humbugger patty... I said thanks, it is not what I ordered @ what written on menu ... Waitress charged me 50% of my plate , which she took back!!!!!! Wow! Fish was sooooo greasy & French frys sooooo dark which swimmed in old oil !!!!! OMG !!!! I had to actually fight & tell them to fix a bill. Will I be back there??????? Yeah, no guesses!!!! Hell nooooooo

Less than 1 star!!!! I was looking around , and found couple jeans to buy. Came to cash register , oriental guy said : "111 dollars , something cents", I gave a card. He is " Debit card?" I said NO. I don't give my debit card. He said, ok no credit card here..... Realllllly???? So, I started to pull cash out. I said, "can't believe u don't take credit card"...... He took my jeans away, and  said " it's okey, I don't like how you threw cash at me" I asked " Excuse me??????" He" no need to sell, it okey"...... Realllly???? I wasted my time there, and fucking oriental dude is not accepting American dollars????? Be aware of this place with debit card!!!!!!!!! Cheap Ass hole, does not want to pay % of credit sales!!!!

I did not come to this location for over a year because of bad service.  Decided to give another chance , so I am back . Service is definitely improved except cooking abilities. Ordered Philly skillet with Swiss cheese...... I guess cook has no difference between cheeses . They brought Philly skillet with squeezed cheep cheese..... Really??????? They think people dumb ! No more to this location !!!!!!!
