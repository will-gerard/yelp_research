Holy delicious.  My husband and I met a few friends for a relaxing afternoon on a Saturday.  I have never been here, but one of us recommended the atmosphere.  I had the Vermont, which consists of ham, cheese spread, apples, spinach, and pine nuts.  I switched the bread from whole grain to sourdough.  I inhaled it!  The outdoor patio was beautiful and the beer/wine choices were flowing.  We had a lovely, sun-filled afternoon with a solo guitarist tinkering in the background.  The staff was friendly but efficient.  The wait was a bit long for sandwiches at a deli (about 20 minutes) but the wait was super worth it.  There is a shop to buy some sauces, coffees, teas, and other "schtuff".  So good.  Cannot wait to meet up again.

The doctors here are awesome!  I found out I have a stress fracture in my second metatarsal in my left foot.  Being a runner, I not only need my feet but need a doc that understands what I am going through.  Dr. Wyant made me feel at ease and comfortable talking about any issue that I needed to about my concerns with returning to running afterwards.  I had my first cast put on by Stan, and wow...this walking cast was almost like not having a cast in the first place!  After three weeks, they took the cast off to x-ray and still fractured...so Stan put on the second cast, too.  Now...I didn't know this the first time, but Stan does ultrasounds at EVFA...so he casted me as a favor!  Thanks, Dr. Wyant and Stan for making an unpleasant injury as pleasant as you both could!

So we ordered again - take out, again, and we had the pad thai (with everything, and extra egg) and the snow peas and mushrooms. I asked for pad thai noodles with my snow peas  and mushrooms, but they would not stir fry them together - so they charged me for a side.  Aside from being a bit overpriced, the delivery was fine.  And really, really fast...order to delivered was 23 minutes!

Espos has a lot going for them...and it is all in the food.   The decor is tacky and the house-turned-restaurant is bordering on dirty every time we go in there. However, the food is amazing. I cannot stop dreaming about taco salads and fresh made tortilla chips...   My husband orders something different every time, but I'm a steak taco salad fan. The food is authentic and hot, fresh made to order. The dirt and the glove free hands frighten me a little, but the food is just that good.   And we usually wait about ten minutes. I do not find that unbearable.

First of all, this place is awesome.  The ambiance is clear and special - open and inviting.  The menu is full of tantalizing and tempting meals, simple and just enough food to fill the belly and leave a smile on my face.  I had the caprese sandwich and hummus.  The sandwich was layered and full, but not overwhelming.  There was just enough balsamic to tease my palate and make me want more!  I hope to return on a day that I can lounge a bit over coffee and dessert rather than hurry a bit through lunch.  I cannot wait to tackle one of the mouthwatering red velvet cake slices...

Dudes...the new pizza is awesome!  I ordered three pizzas, cheesy bread, and chicken kickers for my office team lunch.  I ordered it at 9:30 am for the 11:45 am meeting and the food arrived hot, fresh, and delicious.  The only reason I will not afford five stars is because they brought no napkins or plates...  Love the new sauce, love the new crust, the pan style is awesome!

Small classes, individual attention, and responsive advisors.  I will return for my doctorate!!    The downside is price...it's expensive at just over $600/hour.  However, the attention makes up for the cost!!!

I went for lunch with some coworkers.  I'm normally really easygoing about things like rude servers, slow service, and feeling dismissed.  However, this one merits a review.  Jenna was our server.  She was perfectly polite, but in no way did she attempt to make us feel welcome or seem happy that we were there.  She scoffed at one of my coworkers for asking her to wipe off the table, and upon my few questions about the menu brushed me off and told me everything was good, so I should just pick something.  Upon my return home, I noticed that my card was overcharged.  I was the only one that paid with a card (everyone else had cash) and I still had my reciept.  I didn't scribble or anything on the total line, so I'm not sure why the amount charged was different.  I called and left a message.    I called the next day and left another message. I called the day after that and left another message.  Finally I called again today (a week later) and Jenna actually answered the phone!  I explained myself and she said "sometimes the bank has a minimum on their credit purchases" (no they do not) and then she said "Sweetie, what do you want me to do?"  First of all, don't talk to me like I'm a child.  And really, if I was ready to give you another chance, I'm certianly not going to now!  The overcharge straightened itself out, but I'm never going back.

I went to this restaurant after searching for a Thai food lunch spot during a weekend of school.  I went with three friends.  First off, a child about seven greeted us at the door and then went running into the back room yelling for what I suppose was "adult" in her native tongue.  Second, we were seated and the server came to take our drink order.  My co-student said "lemonade" and she said "okay".  My other co-student said "lemonade" and the server began to talk in her native tongue as she walked away.  The food was decent; however, not good enough to merit me ever going back.  We get to the end of our meal and ask for four checks.  The woman (who speaks English) looks at me like I have just caused her three days of extra work.  She says "no".  I say "we each have a card" and she said "no card for you."   THEY DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT POSTED ANYWHERE ON THE WALL, THE MENU, OR INSIDE/OUTSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT.  And...we don't have cash (who does?).  Then, to top it off...she wants my credit card number to write on the check.  WHAT FOR?  I will never return and have begun boycotting at my school...local and has over 500 students.  Nice job, Washun.

First of all, I love Taco Bell anyhow.  But I went to pick up take out for my hubby and wow...the drive thru attendant was SO friendly!  Just wanted to say thanks for the excellent customer service.  We frequently grab food from this particular Taco Bell and I appreciate the hearty "thanks for your business!"  I wish I could remember his name, but next time.  Thanks!

The food at Over Easy is awesome.  We arrived about a minute after they were supposed to stop seating and they were very pleasant in letting us stay.  The hostess was super engaging and very open to letting us eat, all while advising us that they really were supposed to stop seating.   The server was very pleasant and warm, offering suggestions and never pushing us to leave.  (We did, however, leave when we became the last table in the restaurant.)  The chicken and waffles is amazing and the orange juice is delicious...brought in from local groves.  The atmosphere is charming and relaxed.  Expect a wait but the food is super worth it!

Decided to meet some friends today for lunch...and frankly, heard enough about it to make me want to try it.  Really, the only thing that earned the stars for me was the waitress.  She was funny, just engaging enough, and she actually made me feel as if she was interested in talking to me.  The fries were okay - but unlike the other reviews, I didn't taste much in them.  I'm okay with a meal like this (blatantly unhealhy) once in a while...but this really wasn't worth the trouble.  Maybe I am spoiled, but the burger was tasteless and the bun was soaked in butter but not toasted.  I really enjoy Diet Coke with any meal (I know, I know...not unhealthy) and had to settle for water.  The fries were not cooked through (you know, when they are hard in the middle but soft on the outside)...and just not worth it.  And, really, I hate the "cash only" places.  I'll skip it next time.

Since moving to Arizona almost three years ago, I have been searching and searching for a place to get even near my favorite Thai restaurant ever...Penny's in Chicago.    Found it.  Other than the fact that I received both chicken AND tofu in my specifically ordered chicken only, I am getting so close to my old Chicago favorite.    The pad Thai was made exactly as spicy as I wanted and the take out was ready in precisely four minutes.  Ahhh.  Delish!  And...one minute down the road from my house!

What a fantastic bar.  The karaoke dude is sorta...well, interesting, but hey.  He lets us sing and only mildly judges us.  Love the food - hello, Chicago style hot dog - and the drinks are always cold and delicious.  I have a favorite football bar but the Dark Horse has specials every day, including happy hour Monday through Sunday.  So go.  It's fantastic.  The inside is nothing fancy but the staff is warm and friendly.  They do favor the regulars, but generally...regulars treat the staff better.

The first time I was in Sole Sports, I was a bit apprehensive, as I had just bought/used a pair of shoes recommended by a competitor....and injured shortly after.   Flash not only let me talk about how I was feeling, but talked me through some of my mental fears about returning to running after six weeks in a cast and four weeks in a boot.    Flash's customer service would result in five stars.  I ended up with a great pair of shoes that began to rub the wrong way a few weeks later.  I went to return them and the girl behind the counter was very rude to me about returning the shoes after I ran in them...even went so far as to call a manager over (in front of me) and say "she obviously wore them and now she is trying to return them".  The manager looked at me, smiled, and said "yes, I understand she is unhappy with her shoes.  Please return them for her".  The girl was not happy and essentially threw my return receipt at me, walking away without saying thank you.  I returned a few weeks later to buy my half marathon training shoes.  Flash was there, remembered me, and got me fitted into a great pair of neutral shoes.  I recommended his customer service to a friend of mine, she went, and she had a great experience.    Thanks, guys (except for the rude one)!!!  I cannot wait to finish this half so I can go buy another pair!!!

Met some colleagues for lunch on a Wednesday.  The server was prompt, polite, and perfectly engaged.    Our spinach salad came out quickly and was perfectly tossed in a lovely presentation.  The lettuce was fresh and the vegetables were fresh.    We ordered the Funghi and the Yukon.  The pizzas were slightly burned at the edges, but the burn actually enhanced the flavor of the mixture of vegetables on the pizza.  We had the donut hold type dessert.  Amazing.  Delicious.  I cannot wait to go back.

Pierre, perhaps you should find a bar more...ahem...suitable to your taste.  Sometimes when you open a new bar, you're going to have glitches.  And being rude to the server will not earn you any respect in the service industry...my guess is that you have never been there.  This Zipps is fluid, well run, inviting, and the servers were ALL friendly to my friends and I during happy hour.  The drinks are delicious and the food is well prepared.    For a sports bar...fantastic.  For dinner, fantastic.  For lunch when I only have 30 minutes and I ask the bartender if she wouldn't mind asking for a rush....amazing.  Thanks, Zipps...for continuing the tradition.  Let's leave the annoying ones at home, where they can properly shower without company in whatever temperature they choose.

We have used Wild Horse Pass for two staycations - the hotel and casino are close to home and affordable.    We used the pool for the day on a Wednesday.  It was nice and quiet with no children, which is what we were really looking for.  The pool is simple and well designed - the bar at the back, piped in music, and hot temperatures.  The waitress was friendly and came to us a few times to make sure we were doing just fine.  We ate at Ling and Louies for dinner....delicious, and they use filet mignon in all of their beef dishes.  I crave that food!  The rooms are not huge, but they are comfortable and the cleaning staff is on top of making sure the rooms are delightfully clean.  I would return again and again!  Love the casino - don't love the smoking inside, but hey.  We can't have it all!  Dealers are super friendly and the bars are very accommodating!

This frozen yogurt is amazing. I mean, I love ice cream, but this was just as good, if not better, than any Ben and Jerrys I have ever had!   The bar has ample but not overwhelming choices for toppings and even includes fresh mango. My conoction was tart frozn yogurt, va va vanilla, and chocolate....topped with captain crunch, Oreos, mango and strawberries.  Writing this review makes me want to return right now!!!

After seeing stellar reviews on Yelp via Twitter, I decided to call Aaron.  We have a toilet in our second bathroom that won't stop leaking after we installed it a few weeks ago.  We've tried multiple tricks with the wax rings to no avail.  I called Aaron to make an appointment....but to my surprise, he talked me through one more attempt to fix the wax rings and then told me to call him if I had any further problems and he would come out to investigate.  How awesome is that???
