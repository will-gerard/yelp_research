This salon has been great. Charlie was excellent is helping arrange bridal hair for me and up-dos for all of my girls and my mother. She planned ahead, contacted all of my girls to get their style preferences, and was able to give me an invoice ahead of time so I would know exactly what I would be paying for. Charlie and Matracia traveled out to Florence for my big day, were punctual and did great work. I would recommend them for bridal styling, as well as your everyday styling needs!

We have been sitting, waiting for food and beverage service for at least 15 minutes.  We have even gone up to the bar asking for service to our table with no luck.  Pretty ridiculously poor service for a bar right on Mill.

Lesley baked the cake for my husband and I for our wedding at the Windmill Winery. She was helpful in offering variety in the layers, to accommodate our tastes as well as dietary restrictions of some of our guests. Specifically, she was able to make the top tier of our cake gluten free lemon cake, which was amazing, and several of our friends who were gluten free noted that this was some of the best gluten free cake they'd had. A year later, Lesley offered to make a replica of our top tier for our first anniversary. She was punctual and accommodating to the availability of my schedule to pick up the cake. I would definitely use her again for birthdays or special occasions as the cake is moist and delicious, and not too overpowering with super sugary frosting.

I ordered a large batch of cupcakes for a gender reveal party for a close friend. Since she and other guests are gluten-free, I ordered all of the cupcakes as such. They got rave reviews at the party, everyone was surprised how moist and delicious they were even as gluten free! The only thing that could have been better is more flavor options for the gluten free cupcakes, as currently they have only vanilla and chocolate. Otherwise, they were a big hit; the ladies at the shop were very helpful in setting up my order and personalizing the frosting and decorations consistent with the party theme. The order was completed on time and waiting for me when I went to pick them up. Overall, a great place to go to to supply sweets for a party!

Definitely did not realize the restaurant had changed hands until we sat down and noticed there was no margarita menu. Shrimp in the enchiladas was overcooked, shredded beef under seasoned, and the fajita meat on my salad was grey, rubbery and poor quality. Customer service was good, but will probably make the trek down to Gilbert to the actual Rancho de Tia Rosa next time.
