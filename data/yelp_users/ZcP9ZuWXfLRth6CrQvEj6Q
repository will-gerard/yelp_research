I was jonesing for some corned beef and cabbage, so we popped in here last night.  The atmosphere is nice, and the servers were very attentive. That's where the positive remarks ends.    First, my corned beef and cabbage had gravy on it.  GRAVY.  Gross. the soup that my fiance was served was room temperature.  They brought out a new bowl that was slightly above room temperature.   Our bill for 2 beers, one entree, and a bowl of soup was $30.  that's right.  Two bowls of cold soup, and we still had to pay for it.    As we were eating our disappointing food, he looked up and noticed a Liverpool sign.  Liverpool - not in Ireland folks...   Him:  What kind of Irish pub has a Liverpool sign?   Me: The kind that puts gravy on corned beef...   sigh.

Don't waste your time!!!! This restaurant is terrible. They describe themselves to you by saying they have smaller portions like it's a good thing to charge $15 for less food, but smaller is an understatement. They served a "Salami platter" with exactly one (1) slice of salami on it, (seriously), a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, 3 crackers, 4 slices of cheese that tastes like feet, one tblsp of jam and one of thick ranch dressing that they call mousse. All of this for the low, low price of $12. Their desserts are tiny, and the chocolate peanut butter one had a description that would make any Reese's lover want it consisted of three tiny little brown crackers that tasted more like cardboard than the chocolate it was supposed to be, with several tiny dollops of some light brown paste that tasted a little like cream cheese with a dash of peanut butter thrown in. There was a chocolate cage on top which tasted good, but that wasn't worth the $6 I paid. To top it all off, the waitress was terrible and snarky.  If you want good, authentic Italian food with similar prices but decent portions, try Tutti Santi. It has a great wine selection and bar, and the food is sensational.

Great atmosphere, good prices! The food is great! In an area that has only dark bars that you wouldn't bring your child (or grandma to), it's so great to finally have a nice place with a good menu! There are plenty of healthy options, and also lots of comfort foods!  The patio is awesome with lots of room! I am so glad to have a good neighborhood place to go to!

The pulled pork is delicious. That's the only good thing I can say.  I went there for lunch today. I ordered a baked potato with pulled pork. They said they don't have any potatoes. They offered me mashed potatoes. I asked for a sample, which they gave and I didn't care for them. So I just ordered pulled pork with some potato salad on the side, and a large drink. My bill was almost $12. That's right, about 3/4 cup of pulled pork, 1/2 cup of potato salad, and a drink and I paid $12. When I asked about the total, the guy said it was right, and that the combo is cheaper. He actually said 'you should have gotten the combo". He KNEW that I was being overcharged, and instead of suggesting that I get the combo instead so I could save money, he just laughed it off.   What's the difference, you might ask? The combo comes with a bun. That's all. If I had asked for it on a bun I would have saved $5.   And, the potatoes in the salad aren't cooked all the way, plus it doesn't taste good. It's very tart and leaves an awful after taste.   All in all, I am very unhappy and will not be back.

I brought a group of about 8 friends here on a Thursday night.  It wasn't very busy when we got there, and the staff was quick to set up a table to accommodate our size.  The service was excellent, and we had two to three people checking on us regularly.  The servers were very knowledgeable about the menu, as well as specials and upcoming specials.    The food--- DELICIOUS.  Every single one of us - all very picky eaters - LOVED everything we were served.    The icing on the cake was when the manager came out, personally thanked us for coming, made sure we were happy with everything, and brought us some mochi ice cream.    I honestly was a little wary at first (sushi places in town can be very good or very bad), but they well exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend this place, it's fantastic!

My coworkers and I were looking for a healthy,  inexpensive place for a birthday lunch,  and boy did we find it.  This place is simple,  but clean.  The customer service is excellent,  and the food was delicious.  Such a great value for the price!   There are a few of us who frequent George's Gyros near downtown Mesa,  and they said it was comparable or better.    Between us,  we had the chicken shawarma (entree and sandwich), gyros,  hummus,  and Greek salad.  Everyone loved what they got,  there were no unsatisfied customers!   A little taste of baklava for dessert....  The best I've ever had.  Not too sweet,  not sticky or messy, just perfectly light and delicious!   We will definitely be back!
