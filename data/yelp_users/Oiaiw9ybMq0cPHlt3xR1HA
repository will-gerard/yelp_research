Known for it's fabulous ribeye steaks, I have to say we have found our favorite place for Catfish, it is just delicious, and what a serving, Two big catfish fillets, served with mashed potatoes and gravy or steak fries, all for$12.00, you just cant beat it.  The Catfish is always fresh  and  Fabulous, the crisp batter is like no other, and the fish is flakey and YUM YUM!!!!!.  The chichen fried steak, is no joke, enough for two and just AWESOME,tender and tastey served with mashed potatoes/gravy and homemade biscuits, the kind of stuff that sticks to your ribs, you will not go home hungery, that is for sure. TEXAZ is a small place but it is cozy, parking can be a bear, but the food is worth it. Oh yeah, almost forgot , they do have a lovely pecan pie served a la mode if you like, DELICIOUS!

So I have been having the  albacore Tuna at this joint for about 6 years, Last night we went and we had it again, so we must like it, I think it is the mixture of the crunchy water chestnuts , julienned celery," just right amount" of  mayo along with the mild spices  served with lettuce ,tomato, your choice of cheese and mustard,makes this sooo enjoyable, You choose your bread, we always get it on a french roll( crisp on outside , soft on inside)YOU know eat the healthy tuna on the not so healthy french bread, but it sure does taste great. They have a great vegetarian pita, My friend raves about it every time,The menu is extensive about 20 sandwiches, salads and  usually 3-4 soups a day .  On Fridays - Sunday they do have musical guest performing on the patio, I nice relaxing evening. Can get a little pricey, but I nice place to  eat.

This is the spot for some of the best Italian food!  Hands down, THE BEST RAVIOLI, with a  lovely marana and a touch of cream, it melts in your mouth, like nothing I have ever had before, it is one of their specialties, made fresh every day, it is A MUST...  The veal marsala is FANTASTIC, tender and tasty, the marsala sauce is smooth and sweet. Linguini w/ Clams is just DELICIOUS, you can taste the freshness in the clams( Hard to find in Phoenix)   They end each meal with a sambuca lit on fire, Nice Touch!!!   They have a great wine list and a full bar.  I love it, have been going for about 6 years, It is a little pricey, so the visits are not as frequent as I would like.

If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food , this is not the place for you. I had a green chili burro with rice and beans, it had to be one of the most bland meals I have ever had, this the place for those out of towners, You know the ones from those cold states, who are not familiar with what Mexican food should taste like. I have to say it is edible, you probably won't die, BUT DEFINATELY NOT ENJOYABLE, TASTEFUL, FLAVORFUL, OR MEMORABLE.  This is not the place for true mexican food connoisseur.   As for  the service it was average, not anything special.

This is hands down the best green chili burro and tacos you can find. The flavor is absolutely unbeatable, the green chili burro is like nothing you have ever tasted before, it is a tastebuds dream, so much in just one bite. The tacos, both chicken and beef are just amazing, the crispy shell and the flavor of the meat is just heavenly.   Lito's is a must try, once will never be enough. The down side is it has limited seating about 6-10 people , so might be best to order and take it to go

I had gone in thinking this was a great place, but the outcome  is they took my $100 deposit and I'll never refer anyone to them, (unfortunate prior to my misfortune I did refer friends and they did purchase a $8000 kitchen, you think I could have got a kick back for that, NO! We had change of heart on two of four appliances but with that change the whole deal fell apart. That is just not good customer service actual that is NO customer service. Live and learn

Love love this place, great food, great price and wonderful service. The lunch buffet is $9.50 comes with naan bread. We went in for the chicken tiki marsala, it wasn't on the buffet, the server asked if we would be staying, I said we really wanted the chicken, he went to owner, he said no problem we will make for you. GREAT customer service! We enjoyed the lamb curry, and tandoori chicken, lentils and spinach(I forget what the actual names are) the garlic naan is fresh and hot! We go at least 2 times a month.

Well, at  first I thought  this might be a BUST,  and had it not been for the lovely gentleman Danny and his guest Lindsay with whom we sat next to , it would have been.  We entered the pizza place because all the raves we had been hearing about the pizza, to our diappointment we where greeted by the hostess, with " we are out of Pizza", how the heck do run out of pizza, this we said to one another. So we asked for a menu and sat down at the closest table to see what we might like to try, the stuff crab shrimp as an appetizer looked fantastic the couple next us had just received, so we decided to try it and a ceasar salad with grilled chicken.    Not but 5 min after we order the waitress comes back to say " we are out of stuffed shrimp too!", Holy cow what kind of joint are you running.  This is where it gets good, Danny- the gentleman next to us , offers of the last shrimp from their order and says" don't worry we ordered THREE pizzas- we will share them with you, just order something else to try" with that we ordered a meatball sub.   Thanks to Danny we had the cheese pizza- AMAZING,the vegitarean- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, and the white pie-YUM YUM, as for the ceasar it was a 3 out of 5, the dressing needs some work but the grilled chicken was really great, and the meatball sub was just average.   We will definately go back , the pizzas' are FANTASTIC

Great food, great price, excellent service. The dinner selections are delish, we go weekly and have tried them all, my favorite Eggplant rollatini, and the antipasto is fabulous. Pizza is just like New york, excellent. Super clean and friendly. We are regulars.

This place is quant and cozy. The service was fantastic, husband and wife team. Super friendly and food was good.  Biscuits and gravy where delish, and love they made me iced coffee. The price was really great. They have daily specials. I appreciate a mom and pop place, they work hard to build a customer base. This place is well on its way, only opened in Nov. 2015. So give them a try.
