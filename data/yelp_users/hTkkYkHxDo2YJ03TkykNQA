This was pretty darn awesome!!!  I went here with my roomie a couple months ago, and this place rocks!!  I was full from the free chips and salsa before I ate my enchilladas, though...  :P  My roomie ordered the Margarita for two people, and when our server brought it to our table, my eyes were so wide from how large the drink was!!!  We couldn't even drink the whole thing, because my roommate had to drive, and I couldn't drink the whole thing myself!  I think it was only $8.00 for that large Margarita, too, unlike the $12.00 you spend for a tiny drink in Old Town Scottsdale (yes, there is a time for Old Town Scottsdale too, though.  :P).  The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean, the staff is friendly, and I left full and happy.  This is definitely a place that you should go and check out!

I love this place!  All the guy workers are awesome!   Julie, Angie, Heather, and Zayne are the best girls ever.  ;)  I get treated very well here, and I love the atmosphere. I've never been treated so well at any other restaurant in my life.  I used to go here almost everyday for breakfast and lunch, because they have such great deals!  I've been here a few times for karaoke and to watch local bands.  I have not been disappointed at this bar.  Grandma still cooks at this place, and her food is fabulous.  She is the sweetest lady, and she is more than happy to talk to her customers; you can even call her Grandma!!  Even their doorman is super friendly.  This place is like a home away from home.  Thank you, Hollywood Alley.  :)

I have been going here for years for my invisalign.  I came here with the worst TMJ ever and gapped teeth.  Dr. Brigham and his staff really take care of me and are as gentle as they can possibly be.  He even recommended a great maxillofacial surgeon to remove my wisdom teeth despite my TMJ.  Brigham and staff are so patient with me, especially since I work two jobs, cancel when I'm sick or have to leave town, etc, etc...   I am very impressed with doctor Brigham and his staff.  He really put together such a nice, caring staff.  Once my dog ate my invisalign, and I thought it was the end of the world, but they helped me to get a new set without giving me any attitude about the situation.  I'm still having work done there, but my smile looks 100X better, and my TMJ is sooo much better than it was.  My jaw used to go out of place all of the time, but at least now my jaw is in place.  Also, the staff is very friendly and will talk to you and compliment you while you are there.  I would give this place more stars if I could.  Thank you so much, Dr. Brigham and staff!  :D

Venezias deserves 5 stars. Let me start off by saying that a lot of the negative things people have said could have been resolved if you just spoke to the manager, that is what they are there for. I love this place. I ate here and thought pizza couldn't get any better, and I was right so far. I went to New York and tried various pizza places that were actusxally new york pizza from New York in and around Times square. That pizza doesn't even come close to Venezias. It is better than actual New York pizza from NY! I love it, and I can't say it enough.

I knocked off a star, because I felt so upset last time I was at Venezia's, which was a couple of weeks ago. I am vegetarian, and I asked for the veggie pizza. I paid, got my drink, sat down, and took a bite out of my pizza only to find out I bit into a pepperoni slice. There were pepperonies underneath the cheese, so I didn't see it. I love Venezia's, but they need to do something to solve this problem, so they will not repeat it.

I love the mini chimis here!  They are the best!  The food on its own gets five stars.  They could be a little more generous with their salsa, but other than that, this place is wonderful.  :)

I wish the employees would tell you how much you have to go through to pay your Angel's credit card bill, before you actually get one! Once I pay mine off, I will not use it again. When you go there, you have to wait through the line just to pay a bill. Then, they can't even tell you how much you owe, so if you have a fee and don't know about it, that's not their problem. Then, you can't even pay with a debit card. Just cash or check only. Then, I tried paying online, but you can only pay online with a check. I tried paying online with a check, but it didn't go through for some reason, even though it was valid, so I had a $30.00 fee. Now I don't trust their website for my payments, so I drive to the mall just to pay my bill.

I feel that Wal-Mart is pretty inexpensive, except for the clothes.  I feel that I can get brand new clothes at the mall for the same price or cheaper.  The employees are nice, and it is clean here.  Ironically, I feel that they can do a better job cleaning the cleaning supply aisles, though.  Other than that, it is clean.  I am a bit surprised that they have a little bit of organic produce; I jumped on that opportunity.  :-)  I always get sucked into buying things I don't need and didn't know I wanted.  A couple days ago, I just planned on getting fruits and veggies at Wal-Mart, but I also got a throw for my couch, a fancy clipboard, an accordion folder, and a box of fifty manila folders.   Why, Wal-Mart, why was it so tempting?  Haha, I guess those items are good to have, anyway.  :-)  This Wal-Mart location is pretty good.  I try to shop at mama and papa shops, too, so that other places can prosper.  Wal-Mart is good for some things, and mama and papa shops are good for other things.  Bottom line,  this Wal-Mart is clean, convenient, and low-priced.  :-)

They really should give you a coffee refill pot when you order coffee, to prevent this from happening again.  I give my waitress 5 stars.  She was very friendly.  However, she was taking another order at a table, and I just slammed my cup of coffee--not her fault.  A DIFFERENT waitress walked next to me, so I asked, "Excuse me, may I please have a refill?"  She said something like, 'Okay, but let me go to my tables first.'  I was shocked.  It would have taken two seconds to refill my coffee, it took LONGER for her to tell me that she needed to check her tables first.  Nobody in her section needed coffee anyway, and then she had to walk all the way back to me again.  I am a server myself, and I really didn't understand what that was all about.  When I am walking with a pitcher of water at my job, I fill up water as I go along, even if the tables aren't in my section.  It's about customer service first!  Anyway, my waitress was great!  She was very attentive and had a great personality.  My waitress and the restaurant itself gets five stars, though.  I've just never understood the "my section first, you later" kind of a mentality with refills.  A restaurant's staff is supposed to be a TEAM, not a competition.

Today was the first time I have been back here since I was a little teenager, so I was very happy to be here! I even wore my favorite shirt, my Totoro shirt! Heehee. Anyway, I couldn't believe how many products they have, and how neat everything is! My mission was to buy a wooden bento, but I didn't find one. I got over it quickly though, when I started looking around at all their neat items! I bought some rice that I did't even know existed. Ha! I can't wait to try their Forbidden Black Rice, but why is it forbidden? I've never seen or heard of black rice before!

I love Tottie's!!  I even came to the restaurant for my prom "date" night.  I have been to this restaurant several times for special occasions or birthday parties.  My favorite drink there is the Thai iced tea, but their regular iced tea is also extraordinary.  This is by far my favorite restaurant.  The owner is very warm and sincere.  She even comes by the tables when she isn't cooking to greet her customers.  The food sometimes is a bit pricey, but the food is worth it.  It is authentic food, not overly processed soggy asian food you get at some other places.  If you are wanting to go to have REAL food, with quality service and a nice atmosphere, go to Tottie's.  :)

This is the best DD ever!!!  I come in here before I head over to work sometimes and the staff is sooooooo friendly!!  I bought a small coffee, and the worker gave me an ice water to-go along with the coffee; I didn't even have to ask him for water!  The manager even spoke with me briefly before I left.  Some places rush their customers out, but the workers will talk to you and treat you well here!  Thanks for treating your customers like royalty, DD!  :)

I used to go to Grimaldi's all the time, but not anymore.  The last time I went to Grimaldi's, I did not have a pleasant experience.  I went there with one of my friends, and we ordered a pizza together along with some drinks.  After we had our pizza in front of us, I asked for some ranch.  Oh, I should not have asked.  They made such a big deal, as if I insulted their cooking.  I'm just a girl who happens to like ranch and pizza, no matter how good it is.  Am I not allowed to have my own likes and dislikes?  Anyway, they refused to give me ranch with my pizza and claimed it's because it drowns out the true flavor of the pizza.  So what??  Their job isn't to tell me how I SHOULD like my food based on their own preferences.  This was a truly awkward and uncomfortable experience, when it should have been a fun and pleasant night with a good friend.  I couldn't even enjoy my pizza, because I felt like I was being judged the rest of my meal there, just for asking a simple question.  I'd rather make my own pizza at home, than to feel treated like that again.

Okay, I felt really bad for coming here on Christmas Eve.  I flew back to AZ from Georgia that morning, only to realize that everyone wanted to celebrate Christmas at my house, so I had a lot of last minute shopping to do (sorry employees)!  I do want to thank one employee in particular, for going above and beyond in customer service, his name is Dennis.  Dennis was the cashier that helped us at the end of our visit.  I've never seen such a happy worker on a Christmas Eve ever in my life.  He was so happy to help us, and even told us a little bit about some new food trends.  One of the handles ripped from our paper bag, and he happily transferred all the items in a new bag with a bright smile.  This guy has such a positive personality!  I wish that I could just give him a winning lottery ticket for being so kind-hearted to others.  I was really struck with amazement at the total price of my basket full of food; Trader Joe's saved me, because I fed a whole house full of people, and it only cost me $95.00!    I shop here frequently, because I love organic food, and it is reasonably priced here.  Trader Joe's helps make living the healthy life much easier.  When I shop here, they sometimes have free samples, so I can always try something different and yummy while I shop around.  This place is pretty inexpensive for the amazing quality that you get!

I was just at US nails, and I was really unimpressed.  I used to come here all the time, and they used to be so friendly.  I took one of my family members to get their nails done for their birthday.  Right after she cleaned my niece's nails while my niece was still in the chair, she told me the total amount of money due.  I said, "okay, thank you, I will pay in cash."  Then, the lady insisted that I pay right then and there at the chair.  I responded,"I've been here many times, and I've always paid after...has that changed?"  She responded, "yes."  However, everyone else paid AFTER their nails were completed.  I felt like that was unfair, very, very unfair.  Plus, I thought that was really unhygienic of her to handle cash in the middle of cleaning and polishing my niece's nails.  My niece received the French styled nails, and the lady left white smudges on the un-tipped parts of the nails.  I am thoroughly disappointed.

I come here pretty often, but I still miss the old El Dorado.  I enjoy all the food here, but I miss the way they used to make their fries when they had different owners.  They used to make them perfectly crispy and softer in the middle.  Now, they are done extra, extra crispy.  Some people like that, I suppose.  I miss Tammy, as well.  Tammy was my favorite bartender at The El Dorado.  She always provided above and beyond customer service.  The new servers are great, too.  Tammy was just my favorite.  What happened to Tammy?  :(  Overall, this place is great.  I can relax and enjoy a few drinks.  :)

I've been going to this little convenience store all off my life.  I love having a little store in my neighborhood!  Milk Depot has helped me out so many times, when I forgot something at the store, ie: butter, eggs, popcorn, drinks, etc..  The workers are friendly, too.  They clean the establishment really well, too.  I often see them spraying down their parking lot and drive-through.  I also see them mopping, rearranging, and organizing often.  I like how funny the workers are, I can joke with them all of the time.  :-)  Great workers, great place.

I never thought I would enjoy so much vegan food until I tried this place.  I actually like the vegan meat in here better than most regular meat entrees at most restaurants.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.  :)

I have recently become vegetarian after my last Green review. Today, I tried the Big Wac at Green. It was so good and tastes pretty much like a Big Mac! I saved my appetite all day for dinner, and let me tell you, I still was not able to finish my meal! They really give you plenty of food to fill you up! I used to eat meat with EVERYTHING, but let me tell you, I don't even miss meat with the mock-meat at Green. I pay a pretty penny for a meal at Green, but it is definitely worth every cent. If I ever get a craving for a filling yummy meal and I don't want to cook, Green is where I run to!

Great place, but I'm knocking off a star, because they made my friend and I move off the couch when more people came in.  I don't like to be moved around when I am trying to relax after a long day.  I don't even care if they sat next to me, but if I am lucky enough to grab a couch when I go to one of these places, I don't want to have to get off of it.

I went to Whataburger a couple weeks ago for biscuits and gravy to bring to my mother's place while visiting her.  I usually make breakfast at home, but I was feeling lazy that morning, and wanted to do something nice for the woman who gave me life.  Anyway, I drove up to the window, and probably THE friendliest person at a drive-thru in the history of fast food greeted me.  I believe he may have been the manager that morning.  He said good morning, asked how my day is, made sure everything was in the bag, asked if I wanted cream in my coffee.  I said I'd like cream please, and he asked me which flavor of cream I'd like from their selection and named off which flavors they have.  I was thinking, "Wow!"  I was very impressed!  ...If people in fast food only realized that it's the little pleasant things you do for the customers that can really make someone's day.

On Saturday, I showed up here to watch The Hobbit with a friend.  When we went to the concession area, Dennis was the cashier.  Dennis has such excellent customer service, he treated us like royalty.  Do I look like a queen, because I certainly felt like one.  :-D.  He didn't make us feel stressed out and rushed as I sometimes feel while trying to order.  My entire movie experience was excellent.  Thank you Dennis, and thank you Harkins.  :-)

I love the food, but it is too pricey.  I only come here once every year or two, since I can BBQ in my backyard for a fraction of this price.  Aside from the price, this is a wonderful place to go!!  The waitress I had last time was extremely friendly.  I wish I remembered her name, but she had the best customer service!!  :)

I love Z' Tejas!  They always have prompt and friendly customer service.  I also love their cornbread!  I went here for my sister's birthday on Halloween.  I tend to be a bit of a goofball, even in public, lol.  I used their candleholder as a hat, and instead of getting mad about my unconventional table manners, our server laughed with us.  The servers and staff treat you right, they don't expect you to be the overdressed over done-up folks that feel like they need to spend 3 hours getting ready in order to come to the mall.  They treat everyone the same there, even if you just worked 12 hours, and show up in your work uniform, like I did that day.  Relax, go to Z'Tejas and enjoy a drink and some food!

I love this place!!  It is a little too pricey for me to go too often, though.  Sometimes I will go here when I feel like I deserve a nice night out.  I have never been to Chicago, but I have had plenty of Chicago style pizza.  This is my favorite Chicago style pizza out of all I've ever had.  I also saw an employee from here wearing their work shirt out at a place I worked at.   I told them that I love their pizza, and the man looked so happy that I said that.  You can tell the workers take pride in their pizza and appreciate their customers.  :)  There's nothing like the feeling of eating somewhere that you feel appreciated at.  I highly recommend trying this sometime. :)

I am impressed with the team and quality of customer service here.  I am a server at a different restaurant, and I envy the team that they have at Red Robin.  Everyone helps each other, there is no server-to-server competition.  Wow!  My friend and I ate here at night a couple weeks ago, and we were just laughing and having a good time.  We didn't feel rushed at all while we were there.  If it's one thing I don't appreciate at a restaurant, it's when I feel rushed by the server; I may as well have ate at home.  Not here, though.  They are very patient, kind, and provide excellent customer service.  Management, I hope that you realize how great and rare of a team that you have there.  Servers, keep up the wonderful work!  I hope you know how valuable and appreciated you are by your customers!  :)

I come here sometimes to get my dog some treats. They are expensive, but my dog adores them! The only negative side to this place, is that it is about $40.00 to get my dog bathed. That wouldn't be so bad if I only seldom had my dog washed. My dog is an indoor dog who enjoys rolling around in dirt when I take her outside, so I bathe her weekly myself. Bathing her myself every week costs me less than $3.00 a month. I would rather take her here to get cleaned, but not for their prices. I wish they had a frequent customer card, or package for people who like to go weekly.

I really liked this bar, but I wasn't very impressed with my last visit.  I went with my friends the other day, and we were all just having a great time.  I was a DD, so I didn't have any alcohol myself.  My friends and I were dancing, and security came and told me to take my friend out of the bar. My friend wasn't obnoxious or anything, she was just dancing and having fun.   I insisted on waiting for her boyfriend who was in the bathroom, but that was just not an option.  I felt as though we did nothing wrong.  :(

This place is so delicious!!  I've never even heard of eating chicken and waffles on the same plate, until this place opened up in my neighborhood.  It kind of reminds me of Thanksgiving dinner-with a lot of sweets and meat in the same mouthful!!  I wish it was a little less expensive, since I can make chicken and waffles at home for a fraction of the price, but I have to admit.... my homemade chicken and waffles could never be  NEARLY as delicious as Lo-Lo's.  ;D

I love F&E, but this location needs to work a little bit on their customer service. Usually, I walk in, and the workers don't greet me. So, I greet them. I went in yesterday, and I said bye to the workers, and was ignored again. What is that all about? When I ask about their products, nobody knows. I asked if their non-organic produce has pesticides or GMO's and they told me something like, the owner says you will be fine if you get non-organic bananas. Another employee said something like, I don't know, but I wouldn't eat the non-organic produce. So, although their customer service needs a little work, and although my questions weren't answered, I love F&E! They have great deals on certain items, they are very close to my house, and they have a lot of reasonably priced organic items!

I used to work literally across the street, and still only came here maybe once or twice a year for happy hour. What they consider happy hour prices is much more expensive what I consider happy hour prices. However, the food is good, and the service is good. They even have a doggy area for people like me who like to take their dog with them. It is very expensive, but it is a nice treat.

I get clothes from there that look like they are new with a price tag cheaper than a lot of thrift stores.  I adore this place, but please don't raise your prices!!!!!  Thank you for the wonderful merchandise and happy atmosphere.  :)

I used to love this place!!  I used to go just about every week faithfully.  One day, I decided to be brave and try their clams.  They were good, but there was a piece of shell hiding underneath the clam and I bit into it!  That really upset me, and hurt my mouth, so I told my server what happened.  She brought a manager over, and all she said was,"Sorry, that's never happened before."  Then kind of shrugged it off.  They should have a sign to warn people that pieces of shells might be floating in there, and I shouldn't have had to pay for my meal when the shell completely ruined my apetite.  I have never gone back since; I am deeply disappointed.

I just went to this place yesterday with my older sisters for the first time.  The Casablanca is awesome!  Before I was 21, I would always walk by this place hoping to visit it someday.  When I went inside, this place was much classier than I imagined.  My sisters and I opened up our menus and were in awe of their light-up menus!  I think I kept opening and closing mine for a short while, lol.  Everything is clean and prestine.  When my beer arrived, it was in a beautiful glass with NO water stains whatsoever!!  This is not a place where you have to check your glass to make sure there aren't lip stains from a previous customer...  Jimmy and Ken were the bartenders taking care of us last night.  They were both VERY friendly and funny!  Ken should be a comedian!!  He had my sisters and I laughing for 2 hours!  Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey, but the drinks are fabulous!  It is definitely a treat to go to The Casablanca, and well worth the price.  :)

I just want to say how wonderful Marla, the manager is! I went in looking for something to carry "my own bank" in when I was a waitress, that was different from  everyone elses' to avoid confusion between the other staff. Marla was happy to help, and even called her friend, who was a server, to help me out. She helped me find exactly what I needed! It is very rare that I see customer service that goes above and beyond, and exceeds customer's expectations! She was so friendly, and even asked about the food we served at the restaurant I worked for. Not only does she get the job done, but she is a wonderful person as well. Five stars. Whoo hoo!

I enjoy this place, but it is a bit expensive for me.    I mean, in my opinion, it is just as pricey as some of the other cafes, but you get much more product for your dollar.  It is something I have in moderation, and it is great quality. :)

This place is so adorable. I went here with a friend, and the prices are really good! The inside is on the small side, but their outdoor patio is HUGE. We ate outside on a lovely evening, and I felt like I was at a Mexican-backyard-party! It was a lot of fun, and it is beautiful on their patio! I can't wait to go back on another beautiful day!

Fantastic, food, service, and drinks. Cat is amazing. She is like the Superwoman of Pig and Pickle. Cat is always working hard, and taking care of the customers. She is the manager, and is so sweet everytime I dine there. The servers are very professional, and treat their customers like gold. I live so close, that I can even have a cocktail or two and just walk home. :P I had my first Mai-Tai there, and the bartender was so honored to make it for me. It is rare to meet such sincere people! The beany pie, and their tots are so good! I'd like to try their dessert soon, and their other vegetarian dishes. The food is reasonably priced, too! Obviously this is not a fast food joint, so it is going to be more expensive, because it is REAL food-(and fresh at that)! Your taste buds will definitely thank you for eating at Pig and Pickle!

I only go here when I am craving a chicken stuffed Chile Relleno.  Let me tell you...IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER HAD!!!  Oh, I eat here at least every few months for the Chile Relleno.  :)  The last time I went to Z Tejas, I went to the patio with my sister where there were some flirts telling us how pretty we are.  If you like more of the social appeal, I would recommend the patio, but if you like more of a romantic or personal appeal, I would recommend eating inside the restaurant.

Great food, I just wish it was a bit less expensive, keeping in mind the portions and location.  I'd come here more, if they had happy hour, or less expensive specials.  The food itself is 5 stars, I just can't justify regularly spending $10 or more on a burger.

I enjoyed the white truffle burger today, and it is sinfully delicious!  Mmmmmmmnnnnn!!!!!  I would have taken a picture, but I devoured my food before I even thought of it!
