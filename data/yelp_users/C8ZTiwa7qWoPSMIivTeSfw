My only dissappointment (actually there is one more and it has to do with cold balls...proceed with caution) with the Herberger was I thought it was called the Hamburger Theatre and was looking forward to a meaty snack. But alas. It is the Herberger. Not the Himberger. Or the Itsmyberger. The Herberger. Rickie was an "esteemed and prestigious" judge at the Miss Black Arizona Pagaent. A pagaent, mind you, that lasted SIX hours. So I was a frequent customer at the bar. And the restroom. So I can attest to good bar service. One time as I grabbed a cookie from the bar, he politely told me they were $1.50. Oops. Color me red. I had started out in the VIP lounge where everything was complimentery. Including the ice cold meatballs. But I digress. The restrooms. Clean. Really, really clean. The box office staff was friendly and helped find the right person who had my ticket. Rickie had already been seated. You know, as the "esteemed and prestigious judge". I was basically road kill at this point. Finally got my balcony seat and had a great view of the pagaent and could see Rickie writing and watch him texting me. Now back to the VIP Lounge. No bar set up. Which equals no adult beverages. Kinda sucked. And the food was COLD. I met the craziest pagaent moms. One lady, in fun, even told me to "talk to the hand". I kid you not. Oh. Parking you ask?  Across the street. I think we spent five bucks. I would most definitely return to the Herberger. I will remember to bring my own cookies and to ask how long the show will be. The art scattered about was enjoyable and the theatre itself was quite beautiful. Hopefully sometime soon the Pet Shop Boys will perform here. That's all I have...

When they say HAND car wash , they mean just that. I had no idea, that there are NO huge brushes swirling around and no gigantic blow dryer. Just hands. Lots of hands. Can you imagine hand washing cars all day long? Whew! I'm always ready with a big tip for the Los Olivos employees. Other pluses: Great magazine selection while your waiting Shoe shine person. I've never used these services. My flip flops could use a shine however.  Frozen treats and cold beverages. Sweaty, wet shirted, chiseled Latino men bending over my hood. Sometimes I get my car dirty on purpose. Dirty car. Bad, bad, dirty car!

Oh I don't know what the big deal is. OMG!...people scream at me...you HAVE to eat at Honey Bears. It is soooo good. So I go. Hmmm...WTF. I order a pork sandwich, side o slaw and side o potato salad. Sandwich came with all the s.o.s. which on one hand is good cuz otherwise the bun would fall apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a homo. But the meat suffers from not "marinating" in said sauce. Slaw was passable but the potato salad had that weird store bought, vinegary, mustardy, icky poo cocka flavor. Ya'll know what I mean! I guess I'll just have to wait til I hang with the inlaws in San Antonio cuz then we always go to Bill Miller BBQ and sistahs let me tell you Mr. Miller knows BBQ!

Fresh. Convenient. Cheap. And I'm not talking about me as a date. It's That's A Wrap! Or It's A Wrap. Or Wraps N Things. Not sure, but me likey! I've only had one thing and it was the turkey wrap with cream cheese and strawberry preserves in a whole wheat tortilla. Dee lish! Side pasta dish was, well, your basic cold side pasta dish. The day we were there, the room was luke warm at best. No A/C! Almost made me want to run for the hills. But we got it to go and enjoyed it at home. Besides the customers who were there were stinky teenagers with pants hanging at their knees, bad posture and sad, sulky little faces. Oh, puberty!

Cozy, cute and yes, a little claustraphobic...Coronado Cafe. Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at 5 foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience. Coronado Cafe. Cute. Cozy. Comfortable. And in the end, not so claustraphobic.

First off, I must say, friendly smiles upon entering an establishment goes a looooong way for me. Family owned and nurtured with love comes through at Indian Delhi Palace. I've eaten in a few times and mostly had take out. Service was always right on, attentive not intrusive. Take out packaging is an art in my book. So often, things are forgotten, mispackaged and spilled and well, sometimes just tossed in a bag. Here they do it right. Garlic naan bread in house is better than to go. Unfortunately they wrap it in tinfoil and it sweats and loses any of it crispy outer crunch. Chicken tikka marsala has just enough cream and spice to hit all my F spots (you know like a G spot, only F for flavor!). Saffron rice is fluffy, flavorful and fantastic. Rickie loves their sauteed okra...generally not something high on my list to order but yowza Potsie...dee - lish. Samoras, tandori chicken all A's all around. And you can't beat a tall, cold Himalyan beer while waiting for that to go order and they always provide me with some papadum and a tangy, sour, spicy dip. Remember a smile goes along way with me!

Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!

Gourmet markets, to me, are like candy shops to a sugar freak. "Hello, my name is Thomas. And I am a FoodAholic." There I said it. Do you feel better. Huh? Oh. Sorry. Didn't mean to get so defensive. But how can you defend AJ's? How? How I ask you? Ok, so it's REALLY expensive. And, yes, they should provide a blood donor center at the entrance to give cash on the spot for shoppers plasma. I HATE huge markets. Fry's too big. Safeway just right. AJ's just right and then some. The produce section is perfection. Not mounds and mounds of produce you know is wrinkling and rotting more than Bea Arthur in season 6 of the Golden Girls. Cute little baskets hold just enough fruit and veggies to select from and not too much where you know it's all riddled with germs and spiddle. The meats and cheeses? Oh, my! The filet (at a whopping $34.99 a pound) is worth every bite. Of course it'll be a year or so when I would pay that much again. Hello? Blood donation station idea! The ready made food is dee lish...curry chicken salad and brocolli delight to name two. Yes, it' s called brocolli delight. My gay ass did not name it. I would have called it beautiful broccoli. Just rolls off the tongue better. I've never had a cart wobble...see Fry's review...they ride smooth and apparently are good for the enviornment. Flowers, baked goods, dishes....AJ's. It's here. I'm queer. Get used to it.

I just love being the rebel sometimes. You know, like Fonzie. With friends named Pinky and Leather. Hey,  aren't those the bartenders names at Padlock (or whatever the heck it's called now)? My first Pane Bianco sandwich was consumed just seconds ago. The creamy, uber fresh mozzarella is still dripping down my face. The house baked focaccia, crisp and chewy in  all the right places. And loaded with fresh basil, bursting with flavor. The tomatoes, well, the tomatoes were OK. So why am I just satisfied instead of my eyes rolling back into my head and my toes curling up, like when I eat ice cream in bed? I give the sandwich, for me, 3 stars. Not because it's not fantastic. I guess I just tire of eating mozzarella. The texture gets funky to me. But, this place is amazing. And I will go back. But the rebel in me must tell you what WAS 5 stars today. Julie's organic Carolina gold rice pudding.  I'm sitting in a tub right now. Go get some. Oh, I'm sorry, you can't. I got the last one!!!

Once you navigate the madness known as "Central Ave. Construction" and arrive at this Kinko's you are met with the most friendly and professional staff. It is worth the travel time for ya'll I promise. Other Kinko's, to me, seem less personable. Here, Raul, Rhonda and Cameron (and the other unsung heroes) treat you like a king. Or a queen. Depending. U get it. They really know their stuff here. UB. Link. FAX...all the lingo...they are in the ringo! I've had invitations, signs and all sorts of other "paper" products produced here...all the best. "Oh Kinko's you're so fine. You're so fine you blow my mind. Oh Kinko's". Darn, there's a song in there somewhere!

B of A...what can I say? Let's start with parking. Teeny, tiny, postage stamp sized lot. Sometimes there's a dude there helping folks get in and out. Sometimes not. I think I see him hanging in his Dodge K car with the A/C cranked listening to The Moody Blues. Who can blame him in this horrific heat. Actual bank is on first floor of high rise on Central. They just remodeled the lobby and frankly I don't see  much of a difference. Money would have been better spent on giving raises to underpaid employees or by putting some in my meager savings account. But four stars for the staff. Shout out to Daniel especially. He always takes care of me in the merchant line. I love when I get the stink eye from some unhappy office cubicle clone who's waiting in the peon, er um, I mean regular banking line, and I get immediate help in the merchant line. I know, it's a meaningless and shallow point in my day...what can I say? B of A? Bank of Agony? Bank of A Long Ass Wait? I say B of A...Bank of America! Hand on heart, standing tall....over and out yelpers!

The polio vaccine.  Plymouth Rock. The earth is round.  A list of great human discoveries would not be complete without, perhaps, the most important of all.  NEVER use the regular cashiers at Walgreen's. Go directly to the cosmetics counter. Cue the heavenly muzak. Yes, yelpers, I NEVER wait for my Snore Strips, Snicker bars or Burt's Bee's Lip Balm. I grab and buy. Otherwise you're behind the lady with the coupons. And she's still cuttin them out. Or the five pimple faced teenagers. All paying separately. Or, the worst, someone who apparently is stocking their bomb shelter and has two carts full of crap.  NEVER. Just go to the cosmetics counter. Tell 'em Thomas S. sent ya!

The ladies at Ide Mania are HIGH energy. Dios mio! Don't expect a whimper of a greeting when entering this salon. Formely a bank, with the vault now serving as the "waxing" area. Not that I need waxing, I've just heard this. I mean it's not like I have a little lower back hair. Anyway, this Aveda only salon is fun, professional and affordable. The aroma of Aveda greets you the second you open the front door. While washing your hair with the yummy Aveda products your bound to get a delicious head massage in the process. Lights out Mary! So relaxing. If you're really nice, they'll even massage your tired, weary hands. So head into Central Phoenix, whip open those glass doors and say Hola Gina, necisito un haircuto!!!!

How can I not give them 5 stars? How? I ask you how people? I mean, these people MAKE candy. Blocks from my house. Lots of parking. Clean. Clean. Clean. You could make smores on their floor. Wow, that even rhymes. I'm thinking bumper sticker here people. Create your own box. With the nicest of nice ladies to help you. I mean really, they have to be amped up on sugar. What else is their to nibble on? Great service. Great candy. Great location. But where was the See's Candy professional to slap that 14th piece of candy out of my hand last night as I slipped into my my milk chocolate coma on my 600 thread count sheets, nearly drowning in my 1/2 inch pool of drool? I don't care. Five stars. Five stars I say!

Yes. Another Autozone review. Another trip around the vagina. I needed my battery charged and seriously had no I idea where to go or what to do. Enter, my bartender Mike. He removed the battery, cuz frankly I couldn't find it and I didn't want to get dirty. It was...are you ready for this...under my backseat! WTF. Now I know where to stash my maid if the INS comes a knockin' Goddamn brilliant Germans. I hauled it to Autozone and Craig was more than helpful. I think the glare from my Hello Kitty necklace caused him to blink a lot...hmmm...poor thing. Thanks to the men in my life for wiring my electronics, hauling heavy furniture and lubing me when necessary. That last one was for Rickie.

Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps.

Movies On Central. Look. I feel bad I don't visit more often. I really do. You're like that quiet little cousin I see and think, "Hey, I should really hang out with you more." And Blockbuster is that loud, obnoxious cousin that's always getting in your face. Truth be told I'm not a really indie/arty movie guy. Kinda lame and mainstream. I like my chick flicks. Give me Steel Magnolias, 9 to 5 and Big Business any day of the week. But, I'm impressed with your stamina. Weathering this construction madness and not sucking up to Blockbuster. You pack quite a wallop in that little space. I promise I won't wait until the next family reunion to drop by. In fact, I'll be by this weekend, and I'll take you home to share a bucket of Orville's best and a liter of Dr. Pepper.

Ok. So they're not organic. Not green. They don't take competitors coupons. And, OMG, yes, they are located in a strip mall. Thankfully it's right right down from my beloved A.J.'s. This is a dry cleaner that does it right. My previous dry cleaner ruined two shirts and did nothing to correct the errors. So High Society Cleaners, er, um, wait, I guess it's just Society Cleaners, but whatever, is the real deal. Prices are right. Oh. Oh. I forgot the most important part. The lovely young lady who's always helped me actually has a smile and a warm greeting. Yea. She must be new as the chemicals have yet to permeate her skull and make her rude, scowly and unattractive. Sorry. Just a dig at the last cleaners. Those bitches. RIP my two fave Michael Kors blouses! OMG I said blouses. I promise not to say moist or slacks. UGH! HA!

All this place needs is a few tables, a tequila bar and free gas and I'd move right in. The red chile burrito? Squeeze me? Heaven wrapped in a flour tortillas mis amigos. Rickie says it's the closest he's found to San Antonio style burritos. And. Well. If I can bring home a burrito that satisfies my man and reminds him of home....well, let's just say O Freakin Lay Baby! And by lay, I mean, well, tu sabes loco, tu sabes!!!   So...  Burritos from Chevron + Thomas + Rickie = noise complaints from our neighbors.   Adios, bye bye y hasta la pasta!

Cartridge World! Better than Wally World! I never would have thought I could be so enthusiastic about a store that carries only ink cartridges. In fact I never would have thought there would even be a store that sold only cartridges. But hey, there's Batteries Plus! So why not Cartridge World.  Here's the bare naked facts my yelpitas...  I was stocking up office supplies at Staples but needed help figuring out exactly what cartridges work in my printer so I brought an old one in with me. The Staples dude went in back (as the cartridge stock was severely depleted) and said "Here. This is what you need."  Back in my office: Um. Nope. Wrongo! Took them back. Got a little flack and attitude on my returning and not exchanging. I said, "I'M GOING TO CARTRIDGE WORLD!" Got my $105 back and split.  Today I got the SAME product at CW for, drum roll please...  $49.14! With fantastic customer service to boot. I say  UYE at Cartridge World!

I could eat lunch off the floor in here. Seriously, this place is spotless and more organized than the alphabetized, labels facing out, canned goods in my kitchen cupboard. Elaine. How do I say this? I'm madly in love with Elaine. I went to pay for some doublestick tape to hang a ticket holder in the restaurant. She, very politely, said she thought this wouldn't hold. Instantly told me what to get and got an equally friendly person to equip me with the tools to do the job. Some strong glue and a couple of screws later Elaine and I were smiling and enjoying a cigarette together....NO...I kid! Really though, I bought two screws and some glue that will hold up stainless steel and I was in and out in five minutes. Thanks to the staff, or I would have been back. And I've got better things to do. Like organizing the cereal boxes. Rickie put the Lucky Charms before the Cap'n Crunch! WHO does that?

Let's face Phoenix. If you say you'll never dine at a restaurant that exists in a strip mall, you're gonna be missing about 43% of Phoenix restaurants. Cherry Blossom, located in a deliciously skanky strip mall on Camelback is a true gem. Not a hidden gem, however, as I notice it's been yelped frequently and seems to be well received. I'll have to say I wasn't thrilled with my noodle dish, kinda bland. However, the sushi rolls were fantastic. The tempura shrimp in particular was mouth watering. My friends thai inspired soup was so good I almost wanted to dive in so I could simply lap it up with my tongue. But he hit me on my forehead with his spoon so I retreated back to my sushi rolls. Service was first rate. I had a manger meeting and we were there almost 2 1/2 hours and were never hurried and not once did we get the "waiter stink eye". If you've ever been privey to that, ouch, it stings! There were 7 of us and the bill came to about $100 so all I can is "come on down" cuz the "price is right" at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe....

Just got some to go action from the CherryBlossom peeps and I'm dripping in soy sauce as I type. YUM! Quick, attentive and friendly service! I can't wait to dive into my wasabi, my spicy tuna roll and my crunch roll. If you read this and I still have some left...ha ha...I might share with you. But, props to the staff for the sake while I was waiting...Strip malls in Phoenix shall not be ignored people!

So why is it there are either German bakeries or Jewish bakeries?   Discuss.   What no Scandinavian bakers out there? I grew up in Minnesota where German bakers ruled. Every day after school and before my extracurricular activities (which included trombone lessons, practice with the B squad basketball team and a fitting for my scoliosis brace) I would get a cinnamon crisp and a blueberry filled glazed dough nut.   After feeling nostalgic for those pimply, greasy haired in the closet days...I wandered into Karsh's. So. Glad. I. Did.  Yummy on the Cinnamon crisp and double yummy on the blueberry cheese danish. I assumed the service would be friendly, I mean, after all, how can you be crabby when you work with frosting all day. And I was right. Each time I've been, they've been sweet as sugar and always offer a free sample.   Free sample. One bonus point for the Jewish bakery. I don't remember the German bakers giving out free stuff. Hmmm...  Discuss.

Lounge? Squeeze me. Let's just call it what it is here homos. A bar. Apollo's Bar. And that's not a bad thing (said in true Seinfeldian manner). In fact it's a good thing (he says with a Martha Stewart smirk). Sometimes a place like Apollo's is just the ticket. A neighborhood bar, slim on attitude and big on friendliness and strong drinks. A loyal following of Karaokers, jocks with a sprinkle of cowboys makes Apollo's a great place to relax and be yourself. The ambience, in true gay bar fashion, is photos of shirtless hunks, beer signs and lots of regulars. Lounge? Heck no! That's for sissies who need a Copenhagen sofa and an IKEA coffee table to drink their overpriced martinis. Come to Apollo's where it's real. Real people. Real drinks. Real cheap. Really!

I'm so glad Rickie's tire got a flat. Well. I mean maybe not SO glad...but glad we stumbled upon Sun Cyclery. This has to be some sort of 2 wheeled mecca (though I saw many 3 wheeled bikes as well) to cyclist enthusiasts. Yep. Those 3 wheeled bikes were pretty cool and very comfortable. I see a guy in CenPho peddling around and I thought to myself..."Self, what's this dork doing on that weird bike?" Well now I know he's far more comfortable with back support than a conventional bike.   Now. Let's get this out of the way. Yes. They did have a Hello Kitty bike. It was too small (hmmm do you think it might be for a little girl LOL?) And it was $400. And I'm not looking to buy a bike.   The variety of bikes was unreal! I truly was mesmerized and insisted on seeing every bike while they repaired Rickie's tire. Each seemed so unique and oh so cool. Though they are really crammed in there and you are unable to pull one away to check it out. That probably means "NO TOUCHIE!" I have to say I like at Wal Mart (I know, stone me, stone me) how the bikes are on slides and you can take them off and give 'em a sitty.   But all in all this was a fun detour on our errand day. Great customer service. Amazing bike selection. Cool store. Hey. Maybe it is time for me to get some wheels. Last bike I bought was in 6th grade...a Schwinn Varsity 10 speed...I think it was around $70. I had to dust a lot of furniture at Bernard's to get that baby...

Picure it. Roscoe's. Saturday night. 11:00. Deadsville USA = Crabby gay ass bartenders. Me and Rickie? All pumped up. Having fun. Celebrating a fantastic evening we had with CeCe Peniston earlier with a couple beers and a round of darts. I won't tell you who won, but he is NOT a fashion designer. While we did have fun, the bar staff was rude, rude, rude. And when you're not even cute, really, there's just no excuse ladies! Sorry I put my Corona on the pool table. I'm sure that's NEVER happened before Mr. Passive Aggressive bartender with the oh so contrived messy hair! Drop the tude and lessen the hair gel.

OK. So I was a little put off on a recent visit to Roscoe's. I chose yelp to rant and update my previous positive review. Two words. Chili Cook Off. Wait. I think that's three. Nonetheless I was a judge at Roscoe's chili contest and I have to say I HAD THE BEST TIME EVER! If I'm not invited back next year, I will stalk them until they give me a plastic spoon and 25 cups of chili to savor. The staff was amazing, helpful and very fun. Shout out to David for making me feel instantly welcome as it was a madhouse I tell you. Though I'm still picturing one entrants presentation, which was a toilet bowl, yep, you heard me, a toilet bowl and having gag reflexes, it was a clever way to display his chili. And funny. Did I mention funny? So thanks Roscoe's. You are THE sports bar in town and a great place to hang. P.S. You may want to have a jar of Tums on hand next time!

OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, hurtful messages. And do not preach to me the hazards, both socially and physically, of eating at buffets. Because, frankly, I've done that to myself already. Eating at Mexican buffets was part of the bf's growing up days in San Antonio. One day he asked me to go, and since he's irresistible to me, I said yes. Upon entering Pancho's, I realized it was like a Mexican Chuck E Cheese. More kids than you'd find at Mia Farrow's house. Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning. Why is there a white haze wafting from the hallway? Oh. Some darling little child had activated the FIRE EXTINGUISHER! Yea. And mommy was too busy ordering her Dos XX to notice. You'd think this would have sent us running. But we persevered. I thought I'd be safe and get a taco, enchilada with beans and rice. All were simply horrific. Malo. Horrible. No bueno. The more I recall this day, the more I feel a need for a buffet support group of some kind. Hello, my name is Thomas. I ate at Pancho's. HELLO THOMAS! Good bye Panchos.

I'm definitely a department store and boutique kinda guy. Thrift stores with barrels of clothing all smelling of moth balls is totally not my thing. So Buffalo Exchange is fantabulous to me. Pricey by thrift store standards. Perhaps. And only a faint smell of moth balls. Really, I'm serious. Is this some kind of Glade plug in required in used clothing stores? But everything is organized so well even Felix Unger could browse here. And I love shopping at places where the staff is bejeweled and bedazzled in lots of face and body ornamentation. It always confirms in me why I'm glad to remain pierceless and untatooed. I've scored Dolce and Gabanna, Prada and Versace pants...paid in the $22 to $38 range. I've got lots of casual shirts anywhere from $6 and up. But I think my favorite are these British style (Beatle-esque) narrow legged pants with faint different colored pin stripes over the black wool....and get this...lined in purple (yes, a serious Prince purple) satin. How much you ask? Eight bucks people. Eight Georges. And what these pants do for my ass.....I'm tearing up right now. Thank you Buffalo...you make me look....mahvellloous....simply mahvelllous!

Not sure who the snotty people are who allegedly work here. I've only encountered friendly critters! And if they don't like my clothes I just donate them to charity. And I don't cry about it either. Waaa, they didn't like my Lee jeans! Waaa, they didn't like my Tommy Bahama shirt! Who are these people? Don't take it personal y'all. They're just doing their job.

I heart (attack) Texaz Grill. My tummy (arteries) were filled with good ole, down home cooking. My NY strip was perfection and dripping with flavor (cholesterol). Rickie's a Texas boy so he knows his chicken fried anythings, and his chicken fried chicken was smothered in love (gravy) and he nibbled every bite (inhaled like there's no tomorrow). I chased my taters, sauteed shrooms and steak down with a cold Dos XX and a Patron shot. All this with attentive and friendly service. The room reminded me of the shack Steve Martin lived in, in the beginning of The Jerk. And for this place, the license plates, posters and bric a brac that cover every corner, including the ceiling above the urinal, yes, guys get this...when you have to pee so badly, you arch your  head back with an eye rolling groan...that's how I saw the posters on the ceiling. But all the kitchy crap everywhere works for Texaz Grill. The menu has all kinds of steaks and wonderful sides. The only thing missing is a defibrillator.

DAMN YOU COST PLUS. DAMN YOU! Why oh why did we stop by after a Ticoz happy hour? Do you realize how vulnerable I am after two pineapple mojitos? Do you realize what I can do with two empty shopping carts, a cute boyfriend and a brand spankin' new credit card? Well, apparently you do. Cost Plus is like a Pier 1 Import, a section of William Sonoma and a Linen and Things all hooked up one night, had drinks, forgot each others names, and decided to room together after that. We bought sake cups, sushi plates, sparkling Voss waters, Henna tattoo crap, candles, candles and more candles. To the tune of $228. So hats off to you Cost Plus. I get the name now. Cost. Plus more than you thought you would spend. SUCKERS!!!!!

Ok, Ok, Ok another strip mall restaurant in Phoenix. I get it. We can be a fab place in a drab space. Wow, how cool, I just came up with a new motto. But let me just say, PCG, as the regs call it, is a FAB place. Voted many times as a local hot spot or a great neighborhood spot, PCG actually shines on many levels. Yes, the space itself is not inventive or trendy. But why do we go out to eat? Mostly for some killer ass food. Well, you got it here sister. Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija....yowzaaa yowzaa Potsie. Yummy! The tenderloin rivals Ruth's Chris and any other high end steak place. The corn cakes are, well, let's just say I'd raffle off a limb for these babies. Pot roast is right off my Momma Jo's dining room table. The pork  tenderloin entree makes Miss Piggy cry and me, well I'm weeping already. Juicy, firm white meat with amazing sides. Services runs always a Bplus to and Aplus. Waitstaff knows everyone and is literally family to the owners and management. I LOVE it here. Now, the space. Yes, it's a mini mall. But they've made it iintimate and not sports bar like. The gang here has made a home run on  every level. It's like coming home everytime I eat here. EAT AT PCG people. It'll give strip malls a new meaning!

After spending time at IKEA and Linen N Things, we went mattress shopping. Not the most exciting piece of furniture in the house. Well, not until you get it home...wink, wink! The showroom is a sea of off white cushy rectangular sleeping slabs. Everything looks the same. Try this one. How 'bout this one. This, is our premier mattress. Really? My backside must be numb (insert joke here), cuz they all kinda felt the same. When the salesperson told me I was lying on a $2,200 mattress, I sprang from the bed as if I'd heard some clatter and got outta bed to see what was the matter. We settled on a less expensive version and have been peacefully sleeping ever since. Well. Except for my freight train snoring apparently. But I'll yelp about that later. The salesperson was a good sport as The Culinary Comedian and his fashion designer boyfriend were cracking up and cracking jokes as we lay, man to man, on beds all over the showroom. Plenty of eyes wandered our way when we attempted to spoon each other. You gotta test it out. That's what the salesperson said. Finally, after a day of spending thousands of dollars you get that final pre sign on the dot question. Mattress cover for $99? Uh, no. Thanks though. Well if you spill or tear it or a meteor lands on it, the warranty is null and void. Still,  no. But thank you. It also prevents bed bugs and bed mites. SOLD! You should have mentioned that first buster. Sleep America. Where Gay America (and you other people) Go To Sleep!

OK so maybe I'm just a simple Scandanavian man, with an easily pleasable palette. But judging by other yelp reviews, my first FOI experience stands alone. I get a kick out of most Thai/Indian/Asian strip mall restaurants. The decor is pretty tacky. So, I tend to get my chow to go. I had the friendliest, most helpful lady guide me through the menu. We picked out a vindaloo, a tandoori, 2 orders of naan, some veggie fritters and a tikka masala.  Vindaloo 2 stars Tandoori 3 stars Masala 5 stars Fritters 0 stars ughhh  Naan 5 stars King Fisher Beer 10 stars...can I do that? Service 5 stars False ceiling with stains 1 star To go boxes and packaging on full display behind bar 1 star Decor...Bollywood meets flea market meets storage room Well, as they say in India, um, hmmm...I don't really know what they say in India. So, I settle for see you later yelpers!

I've heard they officially changed their name to Big Pile of Crap.   I'm sorry. I know this is a discount store. I'm not expecting cappuccino and Evian while shopping, though it would be a lovely touch.  But could you sweep the floor? I mean you sell brooms for God's sake.   I did score a coffee bean grinder for twelve bucks. But I was covered in cardboard box grime. It's cluttered and hard to navigate the filthy aisles.   Really? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen, if I ever stop by again, I'll bring my Swiffer.

OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!

This place has more candles than John McCain's last birthday cake. Seriously. More candles than the candelabras on Liberace's grand piano. No kidding. It's like Cartridge World. Only with candles. I love walking around this place. As the name says, it is a great place to find a gift. The candles are of high quality and the scents will fill my entire apartment. They have candles of Shrekian proportions to small votives. And on Saturdays, in the parking lot, they give a away FREE stuff. I've yet to search the freebies but have passed by on Saturdays and seen the masses pillaging the waxy goods.

OK. You know you should have eaten before shopping when you enter a dog bakery and it smells so good you want to graze on the biscuits. Seriously. And had they served milk I probably would have sneaked one of the oatmeal apple treats. This bakery also has couture for all types of our canine comrades. My fave would have to be the hyper pink number that says Daddy's Little Bitch. Arf. Arf. Arf. Arf...that's our Schnauzer Emilie piping in with her version of four stars!

Just because you have the word Plantation, implying old Southern American charm, in your name doesn't mean you can't provide modern services like clean restrooms? Perhaps you could sweep the floor. And wipe down the counter. Oh, I know, maybe the pigeon poo could be scraped off the tables. I know. I know. I'm asking so much. And you'd think with a sort of Southern American name, you'd have that Blanche Deveroe, drawl and all, southern service, friendly and warm, like a peach cobbler on an autumn afternoon. Sadly, no. If I were to go again, I shall bring my Dustbuster, Lysol and my Miss Manner Guide to Etiquette book (yes, I do have one, quit laughing Kristin and Stevey P.) Rants aside, the coffee was passable. Although the coffee station was messier than the Circle K near the airport. It looked as a group of overly caffenited monkeys had just used it. And the croissant. Was like a pastry boomerang. And yes, when I threw it, sadly, it came back to me!  I have better Pillsbury products in my fridge. Coffee Plantation. Ya'll don't come back now, ya hear!!

They knew. They knew we were a rowdy, tipsy, cuss strewn restaurant gang. And they put us in back. Didn't matter. The entire room was magnificent. Carved concrete block. Mission style furniture blended with contemporary. Three ambiguously sexual servers. Really. How can you tell now days? But the food. The art on a plate. Sublime. And I don't even know what sublime means. I heard it on TV once. Just sounds good. Like the food I fed my pie hole last night. Perfectly seared sea scallop with a corn succotash, a Caesar salad so perfect AND served in a baked Parmesan crisp. That means, my dairy loving friends, that you consume the salad and then eat the bowl. Just like freakin' Dairy Queen. Damn! Filet Mignon, demi glace, baby veggies and the cutest little Dutch potatoes. Ever. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate. Dessert was a chocolate cup with house made vanilla bean ice cream, crisp banana wafers with milk chocolate and German chocolate mousse cake. Toe curling happiness.It was so good I had start cutting myself. And pull out my hair. Both very trendy disorders. I hadn't had Cain Cuvee in years and it's great to know it's a meritage you can stick with. It was a magical evening. Oddly none of the Biltmore staying, tattoo adorned (yes it was indeed an interesting and large fellowship), churchgoers were dining here. Rumor has it they were eating Fritos, watching reruns of Highway to Heaven and deciding if the croquet field looked like a crucifix.

Ugh. I realize now that any place with the words club, factory or n things in their name I'm gonna give 2 stars or less. Or the word rainforest. But that's a different story. I dared to try something exotic. Salt and pepper shrimp. Hey, I'm Scandanavian. Pepper is an exotic spice to my people. But, I'm sorry, pepper must have been 86d that day. It was more like Salt shrimp. Or Soggy ass salt shrimp. Not good. We had the obligatory chain restaurant appetizer combo. No Awesome Blossom here folks. But overall this beat the entrees. Chased down with a lychee nut cocktail I was ready to quit this club. Service was amiable, but we were stuck in a corner, blocked in by a large party, with, ugh, children. Or as I so affectionately called them, Children of the Corn. Not much joy in this club. Or luck with entree selection. So I say no. No to the Joyless Luckless Bamboo Club.

Is it an historic mansion, high above Phoenix, with a famous history of who's who? Indeed. Was it a fun venue for a concert by CeCe Peniston? Absolutely. Did I enjoy the limo, wine in the dressing room and VIP treatment from their staff? You bet your sweet ass I did.   But the smell. Seriously. Like my geriatric Aunt Helen's closet. Or the community room at a convalescent home. Or Bea Arthur's hair.   Here I thought it would smell like Juicy Fruit.

An initial good sign of any business is proper, friendly and enthusiastic phone answering skills. Budget delivered. Another good sign is the person pronouncing your name correctly. "Yes Thomas how can I help you?"...as oppossed to "Yes Tom how cany I help you?" I totally don't care you called me Tom, hell, you can call me Nancy Drew for all I care, but it shows you are LISTENING! A lost skill, don't ya think? I gave Joe my request. Which was pretty unique. I needed decals applied to a tinted window on my patio. Something to spice it up. We tried ourselves and those little decals bubbled more than a flapjack on a hot griddle in Atlanta in Julyyyy! I've never been to Atlanta or referred to pancakes as flapjacks. Something I just channeled so it seems. The work, by Jeremy was excellent. The follow up by Joe and his wife, visiting my establishment was unsurpassed. And greatly appreciated. So look for the good signs in any company. Politeness. Good work. Follow through. It happened to me. It will happen to you with Budget Signs.

Nothing starts a great bowling experience off like running into some dicey characters in the parking lot.  "No, you cannot use my cell phone." "No, I do not know where you parked your El Camino." "Well, fuck you too." Now I was really ready for a pitcher of beer and a double shot of Cuervo. Sunday night at 8:00, all games and shoes are a paltry $2! Fantastic. And quite simply I cannot bowl without alcohol. It's like some people with karaoke. Of course each time I fell on my ass (and it was frequently) I blamed the slippery floor. It COULDN'T be that third pitcher! I don't know what the drink prices are there, but I ran up a serious $100 bar tab....OMG....WTF??!! Dysfuncional, Sagitarriun spender that I am...I didn't even care. The glee of bowling overwhelmed my rational reasoning skills. Although my reasoning skill did kick in when I decided to return the shoes and not run out the door with them still attached to my feet. All said, the bartender and the "shoe" man were awesome. League anyone?

To be honest I haven't looked at the prices. I'm so in love with the pick up and drop off service I've chosen to remain in denial. That being said...  I freakin' love Maroney's. And Randy, my delivery guy, is super friendly and polite. Poor dude. He gets to see me at 7am before I've brushed my teeth or put any product in my  hair. Eee Gadz!  My man threads have never looked better!  So I say, no baloney, check out Maroney's. See ya Monday bright and early Randy!

Dependable.  Like your favorite uncle who would always sneak you sips of beer.  Dependable. Like shrinkage after a cold shower. Dependable. Well. Like Depends undergarments.   Houston's. Solid. Dependable. And you know what? Damn tasty! Rickie and I had a pre Slumdog Millionaire lunch and shared the Hickory burger and the oh so famous spinach dip. First off, I have to say I forgot how much I LOVE the fries at Houston's. Totally my fave in all of fry land. The burger was cooked MW as Rickie requested and come out MW. I'm more of a MR kinda guy, but even at MW, this burger did not disappoint.   Service is really great. We all know that. It was less robotic than I remember and for that I was grateful. God, I hate those forced, learned corporate bullshit greetings! Ugh...folks here seemed to actually have their own personality! Wow. Thank you Stepford Houston's. Have you loosened that Bolo tie recently?  The crowd was uncanny for a Sunday afternoon. Rickie asked me if there was a hooker convention in town! Seriously. It was like a slut buffet parading around.   Thanks Houston's. Good to know we can depend on you still.  Like humidity in Houston. Or scorching summer temps in Phoenix.  And asshats on the yelp threads.  Chow my yelpitas!

I had a $20 club sandwich at the Ritz Carlton in D.C.   I had a $30 lobster roll at Mary's Fish Camp in Manhattan.  And this weekend I had a $19 French Dip in Phoenix.  All of them worth every penny. The French Dip was pure perfection, served piled high on warm, soft bread which soaked up the horseradish cream and au jus served on the side. And served with some of my favorite fries. Skinny and salty. Much like myself so I've been told.  Critics pan the limited menu. Boo to you. I'm so OVER Cheesecake Factory style menus. They scare me. I will say if they claim to be New American, I don't get that. It's American. Steak house style.   And the decor! I could TOTALLY move in and not change a thing! The sandstone. The masculine wood panels and burgundy booths. And I love the photography, specifically the entire wall of swimming pool photos.   Hillstone. Good move!

Every time I've come here I have no clue where to look. I know my way around an auto store like I know my way around a vagina. So a big shout out to the helpful and friendly staff here. Most recently, Ricardo, came out outside in the 158 degree heat to put freon in our car. The bf Rickie observed outside while I, nestled in my leather bucket seat, felt the car grow cooler and cooler while listening to The Pussycat Dolls. I know. Ironic isn't it?

Most of us know what a shimmy is. Right? Upper torso, moving quickly back and forth, usually in a dance number. Hopefully a hot chick with equally hot boobies. Yes, I said boobies. Sure sign of my gayness. But a shim? How many of you know what a shim is? Hmmm? A shim is a small wooden plank I use to steady a wobbly table. And I looked high and low for these babies. Finally, I found them at Home Depot. Now, I have to agree with Calamari F. , navigating construction riddled Central Avenue is easier than getting in, finding a parking spot, and getting out of this disastrous slab of asphalt. Employees have always been helpful. I also get Velcro straps to tie back drapes here. Two teeny tiny little items in a massive sea of plywood, glass and doors and Delores (yes, she had a tool belt and mullet. Really. ) was able to find them quickly. I still prefer Ace Hardware. But Home Depot came through and steadied and neatened my world.

Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better.   I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue.   Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper.   I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is "Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea".   There.   That's classy. And Elite of me. Don't ya think?

Yep. David B. Once again the wise sage atop Mount Yelp. I called another locksmith who never returned my call. I called Stagecoach and they said they could help me tomorrow. That's cool. I had a safe in my office and the batteries died and I was unable to open the safe. But you have to open the safe to put in new batteries. Suckky I know! Stagecoach called back and said they can be here in an hour. YEE HAW! Stagecoach to the rescue. I expected a horse and buggy with a rugged Michael Landon (post bed wetting problem, pre Little House on the Prairie...c'mon he was a hottie!) to pull into my parking lot and save the day. Well. That didn't happen. On accounta he's dead. But it was a man named Dean. Lean, mean Dean! No. Not mean at all. He fixed my safe. Installed new batteries at no charge. Yep. Free. Last time I got free batteries was at Castle Boutique when I bought a...oh...wait...my mom reads these reviews. Anyhoo. You got key issues. Lock is jammed. Or your office safe is on the fritz. Get out your ole rotary phone and give Stagecoach a holler!

Oh Sunset Bowl. How do I put this gently. I'm not one to just spurt out my opinion...BUT DAMN YOU ARE WEIRD...Oooooppps. Sorry. Let me say, I had af fantastic time. I bowled my ass off. I slipped. I guttered. I drank more Bud Light than I have since 8th grade yearbook camp. Damn. I am so bloated. Front desk/shoe rental fiasco with Dave, the lovely Jacqui and I was, well, it was puberty. Puberty?. You know...awkward. I mentioned the yelp event and John was aware but not, shall we say, oh, um helpful. "Go wait in the bar!" As typical of my thirsty, nerdish, self,  I was first. I don' t mind being told to wait in the bar (OK, Kristin, stop lauging), but again haven't heard that since 8th grade yearbook camp as well. Bar service was attentive, yet uneventful, not energetic and I realize what it's like not to fee like a regular. Cuz she really focused on them. Too bad I wasn't wearing a fishing cap, sporting an unkept mustache and drinking, drinking...oh,um I know...BUD LITE! Stardust was clean, had great murals on the walls and a great scoring computer thing mcbob. But had NO tables for our beers and snack. Can't wait to bowl again!

Anyone who knows me, knows that I'm not much of an outdoors kinda guy. When I was young and the kids were chasing frogs by the Mississippi River, I was inside playing office, sorting paper clips and writing pretend memos for my siblings. "Please reseal the Cap'n Crunch box or you will be fired". Yea. I was a real go getter.   But if I had to spend a lot of time outdoors I would want to do it at Whitfill Nursery. This place is MASSIVE...with everything you could imagine a nursery would carry. Except babies. That's a different kind of nursery. They have a large selection of pots, garden decorations, benches and yes, even coasters. And who doesn't love a good coaster?   The cashier who helped us and walked us over to the Jacaranda tree was extremely helpful, friendly and professional. OK. He was really cute too. Rickie's uncle wanted to buy this tree and take it to San Antonio. But Texas was not the right climate and he steered us towards the Desert Museum trees...beautiful with a green trunk and yellow flowers. The ones they had were too big, he called their other store at 26th St. and Southern and they had the right size. Helpful and cute. Win. Win.   The nursery has obviously lots of shaded areas, duh, with sitting areas scattered throughout. A"gift store" with a Coke machine...hey looking at plants and cute plant guys makes me very thirsty.   So if I ever decide to expand my backyard living from a balcony to a space with dirt and grass, I'll head to Whitfill Nursery. For now I'm happy living in my concrete jungle with no plants to water. That's all for now. Time to sort paper clips and unjam the stapler.

Dear Mike,   As Debbie Boone said in the mid 70s for over 52 weeks, You Light Up My Life. As Elton John belted out so many times, You're Like A Candle In The Wind. And as the Doors famously sang Come On Baby Light My Fire!   We all know it's about the accessories right. And Mike, girl, you sure know how to decorate. Thank you for prettying up our restaurant with your votives, vases and va va voom! Your votives provide just the perfect lighting for our guests. Kinda like the soft back lighting Barbra Streisand demands in any film she makes.   And a visit to your showroom....was like...nirvana baby! I totally wanted to play house like I would do at furniture stores when I was a kid. Ok a teenager. Ok Ok...like I did last week at Crate & Barrel. Sheez!   And yes. If you want to introduce Kathy Griffin to me, I suppose it's ok. Obviously her career could use a boost and I think it's important to help those out that are less fortunate!   Kisses,  Thomas

After airing ToeGate on facebook, my sister the nurse insisted I see a doctor for my big toe injury. Tripped. At home. Wish it was a more exciting story. Like I was a salsa dancing on a cruise ship when it hit an iceberg and I stubbed my toe. Or I was helping an old lady who fell on a moving sidewalk  but just as I saved her from tumbling and surely sustaining a hip injury, I rammed my toe as the sidewalk ended. Or I was auditioning for the all male version of the Phoenix Rocketts and I wasn't as graceful in heels as I once was...  Anyhoo...my visit got off to a dicey start as they had me in for Thursday and had Wednesday written down. So I waited in the swanky waiting room, big leather chairs, good magazines...no TV however and I was forced to listen to really slow music and it was quite hot in the waiting room so I was drifting in and out of sleep. Doctor came out said they would see me. My toe smiled.   The entire staff was helpful and friendly. I was in and out, including x rays in about 30 minutes. Toe not broken. Just a contusion. My toe smiled.   Thank you yelp. Thank you Gabi. For this foot friendly find!

This smoothie queen really enjoys her Smoothie King. In fact, at one time, we were quite the couple. I lived around the corner from this one, and you couldn't keep me away from his royal juices. So sweet. So ripe. So. So. Well, um....so blended. Yea, blended. Add a shot of wheat grass? Sure, why not. It will only make me friskier Smoothie King. What? A shot of triple Vitamin C. Bring it your majesty. I shall have increased stamina. And while your at it, throw in a bag of those all natural peanut butter filled pretzels. And while I'm waiting I'll peruse your homeopathic book, the size of an armchair, and get the latest on colon cleansing, liver detox and why your poop should be in the shape of an "s". Thank you Smoothie King. For making this smoothie queen feel like a young, healthy princess once again!

How I wish our dog Emilie wasn't potty trained. How I wish my bird Lu Lu wasn't eaten alive by a rogue Labrador a few years ago. How I wish I hadn't given up my paper mac-he hobby.  That way I would put to good use this useless newspaper.   Irresponsible reporting. Pretentious and condescending writing. Horrible graphics and photographs.  New Times. Get real. It's time to stop playing high school newspaper.

I've flown in and out of here more times than Anna Nicole Smith's pharmacists flew in and out of the Bahamas. I find the inside extremely easy to navigate while the outside a labyrinth of epic proportions. What lane do I exit to the 202. The left? Oh, now the middle? And then 100 yards later the left again? WTF? Is this fun for the traffic monitors as they scarf down Cheetos and Dr. Pepper all the while watching weary travelers zig zag the ridiculous signage. Services are average to pretty good in terms of bars, restaurants and shops. Not sure what the complainers aren't finding. All I need is a bar, a snack, the boob tube, Dramamine, the National Enquirer and that funny horseshoe shaped pillow that makes me feel like an idiot everytime I bring it out.

OMG....I am reviewing....gasp, my Scottsdale friends, gasp, yes, a FLEA MARKET. And no, this is not where momma fleas buy milk for their young. The flea market or swap meet here in downtown Phoenix was a new experience for me. And let me tell you, it is pretty damn fun. Now, I can only take it for so long. Like fabric shopping with Rickie. Or hearing about my parents' neighbors goiter. It is huge. I'm pretty sure we were the only two mo's perusing the neon lamps, Frauda sunglasses and mattresses. Yes, they do sell mattresses. Please. Step away from the mattresses. Oh, and probably not the best place to get that tattoo. But, if you're looking for a new sunglasses, like my Foui Vouitton's ($8) and I've had them over a year and receive numerous compliments, you should hit up this place. After paying a buck or two to get in, you walk past lots of weird candy (it ain't Snickers and such) like sugary, lemony, chile spiced fried things. Not as bad as it sounds. I found the COOLEST Eiffel Tower statue that when you pull on it, A SWORD comes out!!!! Yes, you heard me. Just what every nightstand needs. And shoes. Yes, I bought a pair of $25 shoes and no kidding, get more compliments than my $240 Johnston & Murphy's. The best part is tucked away in the corner and it's truly the hidden gem. A store totally dedicated to Hello Kitty, Brady Bunch, Betty Boop, Charlie's Angels and all things pop culture. I could spend all day in this part. If you're up for something different and before it gets too hot, skee daddle on down to Washington Ave. Oh and they also have deodorant, make up, those pictures that you plug in and they have Jesus and a waterfall, with moving Jesus and water, all lit up, and an entire Kimono booth, incense, cookware and a man who makes guacamole, stuffed animals and while you're at the flea market you can even have your car windows tinted or a mural put on the side of your van!

Now the last time I was at The Rooste, I was bedazzled in pink Hello Kitty cowboy hat taking home first prize. I think it was some kind of yelp sticker lol! And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty, enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant. We yelpers devoured the buffet and downed some free beer. This time, a little different...Let the sawdust fly!  Picture this. South Mountain. Covered in careening white mini vans and large American cars. Children. Everywhere. Like Children of the Corn. Octogenarians with walkers complete with two yellow tennis balls. Parents scrambling to keep their brood in order. Teenagers glued to their smart phones, completely unaware of the reason for this holiday. The stealing of land from the Native Americans. Yep. We Americans sure know when to party.  Picture this. Me. My mom and my dad. Two of the cutest things I've ever seen. Walking. Slowly. Navigating the "rustic" entrance to the restaurant. It's like they're trying to imitate Tim Conway. Me? Patient. Oh so patient. You see, I was psyched to have my folks all to myself. No cooking. No cleaning. But would the food be gross? Cafeteria-like? And the worst, cold?  No. No. And no.  From our warm biscuits and Indian flat bread to our entrees (we all chose turkey with all the fixins)...it was a fantastic meal for $20 a  head. Our server was efficient and delightful. If I remembered her name I would publicly apologize for my father's flirting. Heck. Maybe she liked it! She mentioned she was working from 9am to 9pm. God Bless her. Hope she's wearing sensible shoes.   They were helpful with extras (can you say "More gravy please?") and with boxing up to go treats. We skipped dessert as I was serving pumpkin pie, chocolate coffee cake and coffee at my place.  The window booth we had (thanks dad for calling ahead) had those famous sweeping views of the valley, brown smog included. And of the large families swallowing the picnic tables outside below, chowing down and obviously having a good time.   Other staff were energetic, friendly and helpful.   I cannot imagine the pilgrims having a finer meal and a better time then me and my folks.   Well, they did have those cute outfits. Not my folks. The pilgrims. Though mom was working her dangely Christmas tree earrings.  Oh. The. Holidays.

Let's just say these people are sharp. I mean they really know how to cut to the chase and get the job done. I'll even take a stab at it and say they are the best in Phoenix.   Serrated. Pairing. Steak. Filet. You name the knife, Pro Edge will sharpen and shine it for you.   But don't. Really. Don't. Don't do your Anthony Perkins impersonation for them. Apparently they've seen it before. Thousands of times.  Well. So, I've heard.

This reminds me nothing of the cafes I ate at while in Paris. Sadly, however, I wasn't in France, but Texas. Yes, Paris, Texas. My car broke down. I believe I had a cowboy omelet and a large ice tea while waiting for the repair. Here, at Zinc Bistro, I pretend I'm Paris, France. A glass of Burgundy with the French onion soup and some pomme frittes and I say WEE WEE! I've had good service here. Although I've seen larger tables having issues with flagging servers down. It's like they can't rememeber to ask for everything at once and the servers is doing some serious wind sprints from the kitchen to the table. The manager is way cool and always remembers me. I do love the bistro style atmosphere here and love hearing other peoples conversations when I dine a lone. I know. Shameful. But one couple was actually signing their divorce papers over a steak and a bottle of champagne.

Ra. Is Blah And the peeps. Give me the creeps.  Service? Makes me nervous.  The vibe. Just don't jibe.  Just not my scene. I'm a picky queen.  Don't like the snotties. Acting all haughty. Sake bombers cheap and good. Only reason I would. Go to Ra. Blah Blah Blah.

Only in Scottsdale people. Only in Scottsdale. An auto SPA! Yes, they call it a spa. The car washers are auto masseuses. The mechanics are auto surgeons. And the cashier is well, actually, just the cashier. No irritating glass replacement or window tint freaks hitting you up for extra cash. They've always done an excellent job with my car and unlike Jiffy Lubes, actually carry  filter for BMWs. The market inside, always clean, well stocked and the "lounge" has leather chairs and TVs. Not a bad place to hang while man's best friend gets a day vacation at the auto spa.

Finding Ultimate Auto is liking finding some cool, signless club in Scottsdale. But once you do, you're in baby. You're in! It's located behind several car dealerships in a tiny two store strip mall type building. Unlike a club, however, they do not card you or serve drinks. But they do take credit cards and always have a pot of coffee warmed up. Greg and John have been running this business for years and have quite the cult following. And because I don't speak "car", they always speak to me in a way I can understand. "Your car is broken." "We will fix it." You know, like that. I never felt cheated or scammed and they always, always let you know what's necessary and what can wait. Like the brakes are running metal on metal and the visor mirror is broken. Naturally, I had the mirror replaced first. So, ultimately, I don't want to be at Ultimate. But if I must, a cup of java and hanging with Greg and John, in this tony Scottsdale hood, just ain't so bad.

Dr Fry...Dr Fry...He's My Guy...And Now I Won't Die...Goooooo Dr. FRY! Putting pom poms down and starting review... I know could find a doctor closer to Central Phoenix, but I ain't giving up my Fry. I first went to him with the "flu" which he quickly diagnosed as food poisoning (as mentioned in a previous Siu Wok review). He prescribed Ciprol and "walla", I was all better in two days. He then treated me for back pain. What a chiropractor couldn't do in two months he did in 10 minutes. He prescribed the right combo of meds and "walla" I was better in 2 days. He's the nicest of nice, listens and is a gentle soul. This week he wouldn't accept my excuses for my high blood pressure and "made" me start my medication for that. GOD BLESS YA Dr. Fry.....

Well, isn't this awkward? Long story short. At least I'll try. I paid $100 (that's a 10% discount) for office visits and was regularly provided with free sample prescriptions as I was in between insurance. Nice Dr. Fry. I always paid right after the visit as I set up a next appointment. One time I went to pay and the receptionist nodded, winked and "shooed" me away as if to say "don't worry about paying today." I left. I wasn't chased and tackled to the ground for not paying. A complimentary visit. Nice Dr. Fry. Six months later I receive a bill. From a collection department. Mean Dr. Fry. I called Dr. Fry's billing office. Not helpful. At all. I was forced to pay the collections company and yet another bronze star to my credit. Mean Dr. Fry. Good bye Dr. Fry. Oh. Yea, and now I have insurance! :)

As a Minnesota native I've had the pleasure of seeing my Vikings reach four Super Bowls. Well, I didn't see them in the first one, cuz I was barely an embryo at the time. But I was glued to the screen for three of those championship games.  We lost the first one.  And the second. No shit. We lost the third. Fourth times a charm though, right? In my best Whitney, "Oh hell to the NO!" Zero for four. Just like Mclean Stevenson sitcom career.   So Cardinals. YEA! Kickass and Woo Freakin' Hoo Baby! I'm stoked for the big game. How ironic it could be that the 2nd most losingest franchise in all of sports history (second only to the Cubs) may give me the joy of my first Super Bowl win.   Now. Time to make the chili and chill the beer.

I have to say the most annoying person on TV right now is Flo. You know that perky bitch pitching for Progressive insurance. UGH! I just want to smash her face in because her voice is like chewing on aluminum foil while scraping your nails on a chalkboard.   That said, I almost want to get rear ended again. Get your mind out of the gutter folks. I was stopped at a red light recently when the man behind me decided to go and ran his Mercedes right into me.  Within ten days, Hamilton, my now buddy at Progressive, came to my house and cut me two checks for damages to my car and damages to my back.   If I wasn't so happy with my little gecko insurer I would consider Progressive. Course they'd need to dump Flo. Dump Flo? Ewww...that sounds gross...

Run. Not to, but away from this Elephant. Pretend it's a real elephant and it's scary and chasing you. That's how fast you should run. While I've had friendly, if not efficient service. It's the lame food. I've seriously had better things from Stouffer's. Sauces are thick and sugary. Drinks are overly sweet and not nearly enough booze to shmooze. After the Jordin Sparks party at SKYE we met some friends who said they would be here. I sighed. Or did I cry. I forget. But we gave it a shot. It was 10:00 pm and the place was an elephant morgue. Seriously the only guests were our friends. We were immediately told we could have no food and only one drink. Ahhh! Really? How hospitable! A quick shot of Patron and a visit to the elephant pottie and we split.

I had a date with Mama Jo last night and she chose Abuelo's. Though she pronounced it Aruba's. And the Ablegos. We finallly figured it out and arrived to a very bustling restaurant.  It definitely has the look of a medium end Vegas casino restaurant meets Macayo's...but all in all, I liked the decor, very bright and "atrium" like. We were greeted & seated, immediately and with kindness and professionalism. As we were being escorted to our table, I'm taking in the ambience, VERY busy and a HUGE crowd of SMALL little girls, half dressed in tu tu's. I kid you not. I thought it was teen drag night at a gay bar for a moment.   As we nestled into our booth away from the screaming tweens, our delightful, delightful server, Ashley, informed us they were on the way to the Justin Beiber concert. How cute is that? Cuter that they were finished and leaving, but I digress.  I have to say, I truly appreciate a lot of chain restaurant requirements of the service staff. I like being asked if I've been in before. The specials. Soups of the day. Etc., etc. As long as they are not robotic and comfortable and smiling, I'm all ears. Five stars for Ashley.  Mom & I hadn't been out in awhile as we've (aka, ME) have been busy packing up for our move to Minneapolis. But she is as charming as she is lovely and it was nice to spend time with her outside of the house. We started with chips, three kinds of salsa (all explained, which I really appreciated) and an order of guacamole. I loved the THIN, crispy and fresh chips though they struggled to pick up the yummy, chunky guacamole without breaking. Oh, the problems we have!!!  We both ordered enchiladas, mom had ground beef and I went for cheese and a carnitas. Carnitas was sad and dry. Much like my Aunt Helen towards her final years. But the sauce was pretty flavorful. A big plus for the frijoles which had a great pork flavor infused and Papas Chiles...amazing, mashed taters with cheese. Carb city!  We finished with the obligatory chain chocolate lava cake. All in all for a chain restaurant, it was dang good. Ashley checked in when appropriate. I noticed two other nearby servers and their demeanor with guests and was most impressed.  So, Aruba's, er um Ablegos or wait Abuelo's, I might see ya before I move!

A sequined jacket, worn by a member of 60s band, The Coasters. Beautiful Scandinavian and Dutch furniture. I full figured knight in shining armor. Seriously.  And I'm just talking about the stuff we bought. Kidding. We left with a little purple glass turtle. Don't ask.  But I love this place. The only antique/vintage place that day that didn't force me to run out due to mothball, cat urine and sweaty human hair smell. I leisurely strolled the aisles and was pleasantly perusing everything. My favorite. Would have to be the Fisher Price toys. OMG...the parking garage, the suburban house with dormer windows and the barn. Yes, the barn people. The one, when you open the door it makes a MOO sound. Of course after several opening and closings of the door and dozens of MOO's later, I was asked to stop. Sorry. Rickie.

Ralph Rucci. Phillip Curtis. Rickie Gonzales. Yes. Rickie and I had a late afternoon stroll through PAM. Admittedly my patience limit for museums is much like movies, dinner and employee meetings. NO LONGER THAN TWO HOURS!!! And our visit today was just that.  Ralph Rucci: Relatively new designer launched into super fame by way of Paris Fashion Week and two noteworthy fashion critics. Brilliant. On every level. A fantastic exhibit.  Phillip Curtis: Widely influenced by Mr. Gogh (you may know him by Vincent Van...), Curtis' work is laid out, revealing his struggle with colors while painting his amazing segue into more complex strokes.   Rickie Gonzales: My talented, driven and adorable bf....wide eyed and reeling from the art erupting around him on walls, floors and out of doors. What a lovely afternoon spent with an artist, absorbing art in a museum I had minimal expectations from. I would like to dress up the security team a bit from wrinkly, stale, beige polo shirts to black suits perhaps. The gift shop staff, while friendly, could certainly speed up the service a bit.  But my love for the Getty, the Walker, the Guggenheim and Met in NYC is open to a friendship with our PAM.

Need an Alvin and the Chipmunk get up? Easleys. Need masks for a glamorous "Eyes Wide Shut" kinda party. Easley's. Need a tail to complete a grown man dressed up as a kitty. Easley's. Need a pink cowboy hat bedazzled with silver rhinestones. Easley's.   Need a vintage Hello Kitty brouche (spell check not working!) to attach to pink cowboy hat bedazzled with silver rhinestones so it can be worn to an upcoming yelp Elite Event at Rustler's Rooste. Not Easley's.   Thankfully I have a designer boyfriend with lots of goodies in his studio. So that was an easy fix.   What a fun place this would be to work. And it must be. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Easley's is a Phoenix institution.   Like Jan Brewer's speech coach.  Like Dan Harkins parking spot. Like, well, like an early fall kick in the nuts heat wave from Mother Nature.   Easely's!

What a perfect location for Nu Towne Saloon. Way the hell out on Van Buren and 50th something or other street. Right next to a Honey Bear's. And then. That's it. Seriously. On this creepy, weird, strike up the Deliverance theme song, strip of Van Buren sits a gay honky tonk bar. Where, perhaps, "squeal like a pig" is not so frowned upon. It's basically a large shed plastered with neon beer signs, a few rainbow flags thrown in and, on Sundays, a great mixed, mostly gay crowd, all revved up for the beer bust. Great burgers and dogs, grilled right there on the patio. Friendly bartenders and beer, beer, beer and more beer. Obligatory pool tables and dart boards for those who need a break from cruisin and there's even a dance floor the size of a cocktail napkin for those who dare to make the first move. Nu Towne is my kinda town.

If Park Central Mall could speak, it would scream, "Stop looking at me! Stop it! I know, I know. I've let myself go. How can I compete with Kierland or Biltmore? I'm just ugly. I'm Jan and Kierland is Marcia. It's always Kierland, Kierland, Kierland."  Staryucks, (yes, I said Staryucks, catchy, huh?) is the flagship store here. Gag me. Central Ave. deli, a great gift shop and Kobalt (is it still open?), Jamba Juice...yawn yawn yawn...  My only hope for this once famous mall, is the light rail. Yes, I'm bankin on the light rail people. And no, Kristin, I haven't been drinking. I have this vision in my head, and the need to open up that space. Throw in the obligatory Banana Republic, Restoration Hardware and Orange Julius. OK, the Orange Julius is for me. Used to love those babies.   I just may "borrow" one of these demolition tractors I see all over Central and ram a big hole into it. Then we plant some trees and flowers. Hire whimsical musicians, actors and unicorns for the grand opening. I give a speech in my chains and shackles (for the grand theft and destruction of property) and we all rejoice!  Don't hold your breath folks. But at least keep your fingers crossed.

I know my way around a car store like I know my way around a vag...er, um, wait. Have I used this line before? Anyhoo, YAY for Firestone and for keeping track of my battery purchase. My mechanic misplaced the receipt but it doesn't matter cuz I"m in the system! I'm somebody! I get my free under warranty battery today and a chiseled, tattooed person to install it for me. No money outta my wallet. And no grease on my delicate skin.

OK I say they change the name of Open Wide Dental to Up and Died Dental. And I mean that in only a good way. Walking into this dental office is like walking into a boutique hotel lobby. Modern. Clean. Well designed. Warm. Light. Fountain. Massage chairs....  What? Wait. What?  Yep.  Massage chairs people. Far away from the sounds of gurgling, drilling and chunks of plaque and tartar hitting the wall, are two massage chairs in the second room off the main lobby. I thought, "probably going to be some cheap ass novelty chair". "Probably no better than the vibrating beds at Lita's Motel (hourly rates on the weekend!) in Champlain, Minnesota" (it was a prom thing, don't ask). These are state of the art baby and nearly put me to sleep. I went with Swedish and I believe there were two other options. What a brilliant idea. They told me some of their patients come early for appointments just to have a good massage. DONE!  Now the bad news is I need some work done. Ugh. UGH! Dental work. UGH!  Not only did I have x rays done, but a teeny, tiny little camera was in my mouth taking pictures. Pahleeze! If these walls could talk honey! The pictures were amazing to see. The details were, well, actually pretty gross. Ewww...  I was well taken care of by all. Seriously. Not only will I be VERY early to my next appointment (end of March in case anyone wants to join me in the next massage chair...you bring the champagne!)...but I may just book a room for the night.  Something tells me I would find a mint on my pillow.   Yep. Up and Died.

Raise your hand if you LOVE going to the dentist! What? No hands? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?  Well, obviously you don't take your teeth to Open Wide Dental.   Best team in town. Hands down. Teeth down?   Well, you get the update idea!   Thank you, thank you, thank you for helping my mouth heal, for being so kind and taking such good care of me. Shout out to THE BEST HYGENIST ever!   Yes, I still hug her after my cleaning.

Yee Haw. I still got it. Yes siree bob. My old ass got hit on. By a cowboy nonetheless. At Charlies. While I was indeed flattered, I'm hitched and happy already and was actually with Rickie at the time. I kinda want to give them 5 stars just for the ego stroke. And while I hadn't been to Charlie's in a quite awhile, it's still the mother lode of gay bars here in Phoenix. I like the outdoor patio where the volleyball area is located. Drinks are friendly and the bartenders are strong. Er, um, well you know what I mean. Even with the all western nuances Charlie's still draws mos from all walks of life. And that's what makes it great. There's someone for everyone. Why even a restaurant manager with a receding hairline can feel like a hottie again!

Mi Patio es su patio. While there actually is not a patio at Mi Patio there is standard Mexican fare (with a little Greek flare I might add) that is a step up from other local Mexican restaurants. My Chef took me there (I mean, he's a chef, the place is bound to rock my guacamole) and they seemed to know him. Lovin' the "Norm!" a la Cheers kinda thing when I go out with John. Interior was brightly lit, not a piece of black wraught iron in sight. Colorful parrots hang from the ceiling. Oh, did I say they're not real. Clay I believe. Anyway the food. That's why we're here. I had such a hankering for Huevos Rancheros I couldn't pass it up. Served with a chunky ranchera sauce over two corn tortillas along with some fantastic beans and passable rice, I was a happy Tomasito. Homemade flour tortillas are served along with the meal and they were dee lish. John had a combo plate with an enchilada in a savory and medium spiced red sauce with a serving a skirt steak. I thought that was cool. A combo plate where you can get a piece o meat. The guacamole, chips and salsa were all on my A list.

While it won't win any design awards, I did have a fantastic view to the west of a majestic Arizona sunset. I actually ordered to go and was able to sit while waiting and soak in the energy of Thai Rama. A slow Monday night had two straighty couples (yes, you heteros, you know who you are) holding hands and nibbling slowly. The walls were adorned with pictures of Thai royalty. I think anyway. It could just be a promo poster from a vendor. I don't know. And Bud Light signs. Ahhh...America! The Thai beer I enjoyed while waiting certainly helped pass the time. Service here is extrordaniarly friendly, like most Thai places I've encountered. I purposely over ordered as I wanted left overs. Pad Thai. Outstanding. After that I recommend numbers 1, 7, 23 and 27. Paint by number. Order by number. It's simple. And everyone's gonna love it. Thai Thai for now yelpers! P.S. The #18 soup is so amazing...lemon grass and coconut milk. Dee lish!

I'm not quite sure how to review having a gash in my skull irrigated. But I'm up for the challenge. After the shelf fell on my head in my office at work, yes, a shelf fell on my head. The shelf and it's contents fell on my head. I was treated by paramedics (Gary, I believe his name was. Gary with a chiseled chin and blue eyes...oh, um anyway...), strapped to a board in case of spinal damage and shoved into an ambulance. Gosh, what a comfortable ride down gutted Central Avenue. It felt as though we were in a buggy galevanting down a cobblestone street. Upon arrival at the hospital I had to wait. And wait. And wait. Strapped to the board, unable to move ANYTHING, on a gurney, in a hallway. Thank God for the count the dots in the ceiling tile game I invented or surely I would have gone mad. The doctors and nurses who treated me were truly first rate. Allowing me to curse and scream as they hosed down my head and stapled my wound. So, if a shelf and a bunch of dishes and salt and pepper shakers fall on your head, I highly recommend the medical team at St. Joseph's Hospital. Thank you and have nice day!

So I went to this Harkins for the first time recently. I was sure to park illegally in a handicapped spot and to leave my dog in the car. It's not like it's hot out and really how many people in wheelchairs go to the movies...  OK. Sarcasm and current events aside I had big hopes as we strolled into the theatre lobby. Big. Grandiose. Clean. Helpful staff. Then....  I. Entered. The. Theatre.  Gulp. Um. What the heck? Why are there at least a dozen random seats covered with big black garbage bags? I sat on the edge of my seat the entire movie. And not because it was a cliffhanger. I just felt dirty. Not soft porn dirty. Silkwood dirty.   Just seemed ghetto and reminded me of the skankhole Harkins on Thomas and 36th Street.   I may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home!

Since I never knew if it was CHRIStown Mall or CHRISTown Mall, I'm all for the name change to Spectrum. Though by the time you finish this review I will have yet another new name for this mall.  Honestly. It's like their PR people blanketed the worst trailer park in Phoenix with fliers saying "Hey, don't shower, bring at least 7 children with you and be sure to tell them to run around with greasy slabs of pizza in their hands."   I'm thankful for Target. And I even find some threads at Ross. And I have to say Harkins has upped their theaters and I don't find as many garbage bags covering theater seats. How gross is that? I'm not a Costco shopper but I know most folks are. So that's probably a good thing.   Needless to say whenever I return home, and frankly I'm grateful to make it home alive and unscathed by some unruly teenager carrying a shank in his long white tube socks, I need a Silkwood shower. That's right. Just blast that grime and skanky ass smell off me!  So two stars. Oh. The name change. Sorry. But to me it forever will be Rectum Mall. Cuz that's how stanky it is!

Best advice I can give you about Great Wall is to BYOA.   Yep.  I said it. Bring your own Asian.   Thankfully our group of 10 had two. It was critical in navigating the ENORMOUS amounts of food and certainly critical in deciding which things the gringos could handle.  Thumbs up to postickers, egg rolls, chow mein noodles, shui mai and other various dumplings.   And a big phew for a tutorial on how to eat fresh shrimp. "Peel off the shell, suck out the brains and then eat the rest."  Yep.   This is where I swig down a cold Tsing Tao  And the chickens feet. Oh for the love. The freakin' chicken feet. "Just suck off the skin and throw the foot back on the plate."  Yep.  BYOA! I'm telling ya.  I had a BLAST. Carts were everywhere. Service was friendly and swift. Ten of us ate and ate and ate for $200 including tip. Oh. Also one of my Asian American diners informed me that the one man pushing the "porridge" cart only stops at the white people tables because the "porridge" is absolutely frightening to see. Sure enough. He stopped by our tables and scooted quickly by those tables full of Asians.   I love a place with a sense of humor.   Great food. Great fun. Great Wall.

Thank you Yelp. Thank you Tamara. Another fantastic example of Yelp working its Yelp magic. I had been unable to locate our usual mobile dog grooming service. Just disappeared off the face of the earth. Probably went to Pluto...Pluto? Get it? The dog, the planet, oh, never mind. Then I read Tamara's review of Galloping Groomer. Mind you, my adorable and gifted Emilie was in true need of a wash and wax. She went from "Best in Show" to "Mangy Ho". Poor thing. Enter Galloping Groomer. Right to your front door. They whisked Emilie out to the mobile spa and she never knew the wiser. Sweet thing, cute but not so smart, thought she was going for a poop sniffing walk. Anyway. Friendly. Professional. And really, most importantly, I know this will sound cheesey, but loving. Our groomer LOVES dogs and it shows. So thank you Tamara. Thank you Yelp. Thank you God...oh, wait, I'm not on a televised award show. Emilie is now cuter than ever and smells of lilacs and vanilla instead of well, Alpo breath and dog sweat.

I rented a karaoke machine for the FEZ Holiday Jamboree...at first glance the equipment looked antiquated, weathered and beat. Much like myself at the end of the FEZ Holiday Jamboree. Because I'm severly challenged with electronics and such, I had someone set it up for me. It worked like a charm. We had over 400 CDs, 2 wireless mikes, speakers and a tv monitor. The monitor looked like something we had in our basement rec room growing up. But who cares? It did the job. Total cost was around $180. Beware of my youtube rendition of Rock Lobster, Love Will Keep Us Together and, as Mr. Johnny Cash himself, rolls over in his grave, Ring of Fire. Youtube viewers, you've been warned.

My heart HEARTS Dr. Battersby. And, well, so does the rest of me. What? A doctor who actually spends time with me? A doctor, seemingly, genuinely concerned? A doctor who takes my blood pressure and doesn't leave it to the nurse? I was a bit nervous upon entry, as the waiting area, is, well, it's kinda ghetto. Perhaps not ghetto. But sort of like someones basement TV room. But it's the nurturing that counts and Dr. B is the man! He wrote my prescription for my soaring blood pressure (hey, it's genetic! BACK OFF! I'M NOT A STRESSFUL PERSON!)...Oh damn, I need a cup of chamomile and a foot massage. Rickie!!!!

Ahhh...a restaurant with a name right out of the 80s. Bestow my heart! The BC as the regs call it, caps the end of little strip of shops in Oldtown Scottsdale. It is the Hugo's (West Hollywood reference) of Scottsdale. Lots of eye candy for boys and girls. The staff is mostly women, and quite the hotties they are. The space is very uncluttered and has great views of the passersbys and cars whippin' down Scottsdale Road. The oatmeal (add blueberries) is fantastic. The breakfast burrito is muy excelente. Orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and the coffee is strong and robust. Just like my Aunt Helen. The place is packed on the weekends, so expect a wait. Truly a hot,  hip spot on boulevard I call Snottsdale.

Tragically hip. Tragically mediocore service (they serve good coffee, the staff should really drink more...let's pick up the pace here people!). Tragically, not in my comfort  zone anymore. What's not so tragic is the freakin' white flannel hash. The bomb. Perfect everytime. I purposely leave some in the corners of my mouth so I can continue to snack on it as I walk to my car.

Things to get at Kona Grill. Macadamia Nut Crusted Chicken.  Things not to get at Kona Grill. Everything else.   Pros: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not.   Cons: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not.   Misc.: Basement like atmosphere. Car fumes. Families (ugh, i.e., CHILDREN). You're still in a mall.   Aloha Kona. Aloha. Mele Kelikimaka. Mahalo. Magnum P.I.

Like a candy store for chicks and gay guys. So fun. I could browse, sniff and spritz the colognes for hours. I'm amazed at all the products that are out there. Now, I know nothing about make up but am learning more as I attend more fashion shows and go behind the scenes. It's pretty impressive the difference the good stuff is compared to well, something, you'd get at Walgreen's. Rickie bought something called Lip Injector here. WOW...that's some freaky ass stuff. I seriously saw his lips poof up like Goldie Hawn in The First Wive's Club. I don't know if there's botulism or cayenne pepper in there, but that stuff worked. So fellas, your ladies will love anything from here this holiday season. And gay fellas, well, you already know!

On the cups it explains how they traveled the world to find the best chocolate for their frozen blended drinks. Really? The world? Not just from Reseda to Riverside? And the whip cream? Did you spend months in Wisconsin at dairy seminars? Let's be real here. First off, CBATL kicks Starbucks hairy ass! Coffees are robust without being bitter. Unlike my surly lesbian Aunt in Fargo. She? Robust and bitter. But, she is, afterall, living in Fargo. But I digress. This location has a fun trivia game each day. The obligatory living room area is cozy and offers views of Scottsdale Road. But back to the blended drinks and the world famous chocolate. I really have no idea, nor do I care, but their ice blended mochas are mouth watering, toe curling, brain freezing dee lites.

My favorite signs at TOPH: *Please turn cell phones off while dining at TOPH! (annoyed by and enjoyed by this sign) * No oatmeal during summer! (WTF! LOL!) * This room dedicated to my friend Stanley (the back room had a plaque...Stanley who? Kubrik? Roper? Steemer?...the mystery remains...) Retro diner meets whimsical, artsy cafe. The front room has a counter complete with beehived, geriatric waitresses. Back room, a little more modern with trippy artwork (floating pancakes on a checkered sidewalk...kinda Willie Wonka meets flour...glad I wasn't in my mushroom phase) We had the most delightful server, very accommodating, friendly and yes...beehived and geriatric. We ordered typical fare like eggs, bacon and such and yes, PANCAKES. The buttermilk pancakes did not disappoint though I do enjoy a slightly crispy edge on my flapjacks. Banana cakes were just sweet enough. Yummy! Prices, however, not so retro but not over the top. Loved our staycation, loved my cakes, loved the architecture but not loving the $2.50 ATM charge because they don't accept credit or debit cards. Sneaky pancake people!

Apparently the original name was Fuckrudder's but for some reason that didn't take off. So a few multi million dollar advertising meetings later, waaa laa, Fuddrucker's. Ahhh, c'mon, it's still fun to say. Now, is it fun to eat here? Well, back in it's hey day, I thought it was pretty fun. Design your own burger. Grab a beer. Chow down. However, the last time I ate at Fuddrucker's, it was a sad sight. The "burger bar" was a disaster. Nothing really interesting for toppings. Except for the artificial nacho cheese sauce perhaps. And what was there was picked over like the last bologna wrapped pickle at a trailer park picnic. And speaking of trailer parks, even though this particular Fuckrudder's, ooops, er um, I mean Fuddrucker's is in tony Scottsdale, the clientele was, was, well they scared me.

One of my fave t-shirts reads "Spooning Leads to Forking." That said, all I can say, is that whatever leads me back to the Roaring Fork is OK with me. A sprawling, rustic space with antler chandeliors (pahleeze, I can't spell that) and a roaring fireplace serving up fantastic New American fare. A perfect spot for a post movie double date. Let's start off in reverse by reviewing the desserts....The banana split, with fried bananas would make even a monkey cry with ecstacy. We were fighting for the last bite. Entrees of roasted duck with sour cherry sauce and sauteed cabbages was delectible. I ate, seriously, every bite. Rickie's fried chicken was juicy and crisp. The seared Ahi tuna with fresh avocado was perfectly prepared. Appetizer fish tacos were fresh, clean and light. All pre dinner salads were crisp and tossed in fantastic dressings. My field green salad, however, was short on beets and the fried goat cheese a bit gummy and luke warm. Service was polite, friendly, although I would enjoy a little more spark and verve from the staff. She seemed like she was sleep walking. Wine list was extensive. Crowd was very family like this evening, with lots of holiday revelery and gift exchange. Great spirited vibe all around. Can't wait to go back. Perhaps I'll wear my t-shirt. Perhaps the server will wake up.

OK. Reviewing PF Changs in Phoenix is like reviewing Delux, Barrio Cafe or some other overly reviewed although perhaps well deserving place. That long incorrectly worded sentence aside, I have to say, we had a fantastic Chang experience. Mostly due to the fact that we were buzzed after the fabulously thrown Gabi yelp event. And we didn't choose to wait for a table, yet sat at the bar, with the other drinkers. We quickly made friends with the bar staff, and diners on either side of us. The spring rolls were crisp, hot and well, kinda bland. Thank you sides o sauce. The mushu pork was dee lish as was the Spicy Chang Chicken. However, riding the bland wagon, was the chicken fried rice. Undercooked and totally void of flavor. The sake was hot, just like the electronics were our diners to the left were hawking. Seriously. He went to his car to retrieve things. Thanks. But no thanks. Service was outstanding. Energy in the restaurant was fun. Unusual for me to give 4 stars to a chain restaurant, unless there's and in and an out in the name. But here goes for tonight. Four stars PF. Four stars! More on service and ambiance than food. But four stars nonetheless!

May 19, 2008 THIS IS NOW CALLED TOTTIE'S ASIAN FUSION. SAME FABULOUS OWNERS. EXPANDED DIGS. MORE SUSHI. Can't wait to check it out!  Bland strip mall location does not equal bland experience. Do not be leary of an Asian restaurant that covers Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Normally that would scare me off. The room is full of well kept plants and the obligatory bamboo plants. The staff is uber friendly. This is probably due to the owners who go out of their way to know regulars names. I hadn't been there in months and Tottie remembered both me and my partners names.  You MUST have the Tottie Spring Rolls....perfectly fried thin skinned yet plumply filled rolls served with large leaves of lettuce, fresh mint and cilantro along with fish sauce. The cool of the produce with the hot of the roll is so yummy I eat four and my partner eats four.  I love the Thai section so far. I don't remember the name of what I've ordered recently but it had the best "fun" noodles with veggies and chicken....dee lish! The owner/chef checks on tables, is a dee lite and extremely personable lady. The menu is large and deserves exploring. Also a must order is an appetizer of chicken served over a fire with sugar sticks. Unreal.  This is truly a warm and loving place.

Tottie the Hottie. She is such a delight. I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce. But, meanwhile, I'll use her thin, crisp, hot and fresh spring rolls. Much of the staff appears to have been hired from Puberty Weekly. Seriously. Though very friendly, not very efficient. Great dinner with amazing friends before my stand up show this past Sunday.

Imagine my horror when I dined at Tottie's recently and she quoted from my last update..."I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce.  Yep. That's what I said. It was preceded however by how delightful she is. And believe me, she is. Such a good sport. We had a good laugh.  We ate here Sunday afternoon after attending the ridiculous Warehouse Sale at Mojave Middle School in Scottsdale (think Ed Hardy vomiting in a gymnasium). So we were hungry and ready for Tottie's Rolls. We consumed THREE orders! Fabulous as always. Potstickers were perfection as was the Hot n Sour soup. Serve was spot on, friendly and playful even!  So Tottie. You rock my dim and my sum! Can't wait to go back!

Ok. I've decided next time I enter the Kiehl's area of the cosmetic section to simply take a Sharpee and write SUCKER across my forehead. Those fancy ladies with their fancy smocks, see two gay guys headed their way and I can see the dollar signs replacing their pupils. KA CHING! Really, I just need a face lotion. Hmmm....17 different kinds. All with hard to pronounce extracts and oils. Do I need the Fortifying Baobab skin therapy? Or maybe the Centella Recovery skin salve. Or perhaps the Creamy Avocado Eye treatment? Ok, I could pronounce avocado. And yes, I tasted it. Nothing like guacamole. I get great customer service here. I'm not intimidated like other folks seem to be. Gimme a break. They're retail workers. Nothing wrong with that at all. Then why do I know so many people who won't go there cuz they're "afraid" of the employees. Get a spine people. And while you're there, I'm sure you'll find some kind of spine lotion or salve.  The men's department is fantastic as well. I pretty much only shop there when I see those wonderul CLEARANCE signs calling my name.  BEST PART OF Needless Mark up is the FREE valet parking. Nothing worse than circling the narrow parking garage across the street. I ALWAYS use the valet service here even when I'm not shopping at Neiman's. Oh, and leave the Visa and MasterCard at home, cuz they don't take them. I know that makes people crazy. But c'mon, it's a Dallas based store....need I say more!

I'm a little bit country. I'm a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak General Store is all country baby. 100% U.S. grade countrilicous! Well, ok, it's in North Scottsdale so it's got a pretty yuppified clientele. Part gas station, convienence store, cafe and post office....this is the cutest place ever. Was kinda my morning hang when I lived at DCRanch. Cup o joe, and the #1 Breakfast with 1 pancake, 2 eggs and bacon. I'm tellin' ya...it's good. Hard to screw up bacon and eggs so I'll rave about my pcake...a bit crispy around the edges and full of buttermilk flavor. Syrup is heated just right and comes in a squeeze bottle the waitress pulls out of her apron pocket. Is that a squeeze bottle of syrup in your apron or are you just happy to see me? Coffee is sturdy and aromatic...like my lesbian cousin Rita. I haven't eaten off the lunch menu...to me it's all about breakfast. My friends have ordered and enjoyed canteloupe with cottage cheese and some kind of omelette which escapes me now, cuz, frankly, I'm not a big fan of the omelette. Childhood trauma and I can't go into it now. The funniest thing about this place are the copper pots and other bric a brac hanging from the rafters that are all for sale. Some of the pots are like $100! OMG....They also have a gas pump that's like $5,000...I guess that's where North Scottsdale meets the country general store. So hitch up the wagon and skeedaddle on up to the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Tell 'em Thomas sent ya

Things you see people buying on the TV commercial for Goodwill: A vintage guitar. A Humell figurine. A flawless 1950s Danish pine nightstand.  Things I saw: Lots of macrame A Ouji board game. Missing the board. Seriously. My bored mother in law. Me yawning. And gasping for air.   Seriously.  This was one STINKY place. I'm sorry. It was hard to stick around and peruse the material past of strangers. But. It's Goodwill, so I can't give it one star. And I bonded with my MIL that day. So add a star.  Good? Probably. Will? I go back?   Please no. Don't make me. Unless the MIL is back intown.

I didn't know I could get so excited about a print shop. Reminds of when I was surprised by the enthusiasm at Lighting Unlimited (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lighting-unlimited-phoenix-3#hrid:hME56PbLhd2RdUL2S304Og/src:self). I mean really how exciting can the printing business be?   "Alright ma'am, we will have your 50 Eric Estrada posters ready at 5:00pm." "No I'm sorry we don't carry I Heart Joe Arpaio stickers." And "Yes, you can have the empty boxes outside for moving."  Well, I'm not sure if it's exciting, but I can tell you Mike and the gang at Alpha Graphics are top drawer!  I'm in constant need of printed materials from biz cards and menus to posters and marketing inserts. These folks have it all. And. They. Deliver. Yep. Deliver. Gotta love that! And with that Alpha Graphics smile and professionalism. And the prices are competitive!   Now. If I could just get them to deliver me a pizza next time too! Printed material and pizza...and...maybe light bulbs.

Am I cool enough for Go Kat Go? Am I worthy of the tiki bar? Am I worthy of the vast coaster selection? As a non smoker, could I use the trendy ash trays that say things like "Jesus Doesn't Like When You Smoke"? And Betty Paige? WTF? I like Betty Boop. Does that seperate the gays from the straighties? Lots of trendy t shirts and an assortment of cool hats. I have to say, this is a place I could wander around for hours. Sale aside, prices are not cheap. But approachable. This is a HIP place to gift shop. Or waste away your paycheck on things you know you don't need. But want. Go Kat Go? Yes, Go! Go! Go!

Though I've never been to Amsterdam (the country), I don't quite see the connection to Amsterdam (the club). I've heard in Amsterdam (the country) you're able to buy both cannabis and a whore right out in the open. Yet at Amsterdam (the club), I've yet to see this happen. Tho I have seen some slutty looking dudes who perhaps are wearing a hemp inspired cologne as they leave a restroom stall. So perhaps Amsterdam (the country) is as famous for their amazing martinis as Amsterdam (the club). Not sure. But the boys, the booze and the beat at Amsterdam (the club) are top notch in the Phoenix club scene. With a large patio, several rooms to cruise and schmooze and an ever growing mixed crowd, Amsterdam (the club...OK...I feel as though you're catching on) make for a fabulous night out.

My illustrious "baseball" career began with t-ball. There I was, stranded out in no hitsville right field waving to my parents. Well I'll be doll garned a fly ball is coming my way. My parents waving turned to them pointing earnestly at something behind me. What in the heck were they pointing at I thought? Turns out it was the ball rolling towards the fence just recently hit. I retrieved that ball, with shame, and threw it to the 2nd baseman, and managed to wave once again to my folks in the stands.   That said, I love stadiums. I love the feeling you get entering an arena with thousands of people all in one place to have a good time. That's the energy I like and feel in most stadiums. Chase was no different. I love how the field is so open from all points in the concourse. For a domed stadium, it indeed feels very open. View was great from the 1st baseline. And the food choices were fantastic.   Now the fans. Seriously. You'd think we were at a Xanax festival. And I love seeing the father and son teams. Very nostalgic. And indeed it was my dad's birthday, so I was struck by that and it brought back so many amazing and loving memories. But jeez.. We must have been in the "I don't talk to me kid during the game" section. These were very serious fathers. Or overly medicated.  Can't wait to go back. Take me out to the...oh, never mind, I'll spare you.

Scary things to me: Paris Hilton has a career.  Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant.  My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim! Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe.   Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me.   Finally. I found it. And entered.   Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here. I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however.   I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it!   I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off.   Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

Wow...I just found this little hidden gem here in CenPho. I'm sure no one's heard of it...hee hee... Lux is like the community center for the hipsters and thirsties. I don't know if I"m hip, but I do know sometimes I get thirsty. For some java. And thirsty for a non Starbucks place to hang. I think the loud DJ music kicks ass. What a great stamp to put on the ever so tiring hip coffee house scene still sprouting up across this great land. Funky art? Seen it. Eclectic rec room furniture. Sat on it. Tattooed and face- bejeweled employees? A must have. But the DJ? That's all Lux baby. My doctor has "suggested" (ok, like he totally insists) that a go easy on the caffeine. So one cup of this sturdy liquid beans keeps me going all day. Muffins and scones are great, especially if you get there real early. The Lux crew is friendly and efficient. It's so popular that navigating the small quarters at peak hours can be dicey. I know I've bumped a few end tables in my quest to get out and hear the slosh of a patron's coffee spilleth over. But, you know. Since I'm so hip, I just keep walking.

Last Chance? Yea, more like Fat Chance. Like fat chance you'll ever find anything worthy of wearing. At least for the men's department anyway. I'll I saw were a sea of men's XL business shirts cluttering up this dank and claustraphobic basement store. And the place was packed. They must have something for the ladies, cuz it was like a bunch of my mom's bridge friends all had lunch at CoCo's and were amped up on sugar and caffeine. Grabbing stuff. Giving the stink eye. Not a pleasurable experience. So Last Chance. I only gave you one chance.

So. Fabulouso! I'm cereal. From the chips and salsa to the green chile cheese crisp to the endless parade of margaritas and shots of tequila right down to my bean tostada, out of this world tamale and cheesey cheese ensheelotta....  Well...  If it were legal to marry a restaurant, I would seriously consider courting Via Delosantos. But it's not. Can't marry a goat. Can't marry a gay. Can't marry a restaurant.   We had attentive and friendly service and was informed because it was 9:30 it was last call. So we ordered up! Went with my besties who are regulars so I feel as though we were extra pampered.   Extremely generous tequila list. Comfortable and cozy decor. Clean restrooms. Great company and delicious food.  As Arnold says "I'll be backito!"

Lions and cougars and manthers! Oh my! Yep. I might as well have been on a safari....the cougars we're thick as thieves. We were here for an event and this joint was jumpin'! Thankfully, it must hold 10,000 people...it is enormous. Lots of different rooms, patios and lounges for the cougars to make their attack. I had VIP service so I can't complain about that. The food was a buffet and was actually quite good. Of course I could have eaten a dish rag and been happy as I needed something to soak up the free Patron. Yep. Free Patron. The crowd was typical for this neck of Scottsdale. Hello stereotype! Could you be any more accurate. I had fun mingling, people watching and leaving. Yep. Leaving. We made a quick escape after I was called a fag in the bathroom by some gelled up, steroided out cardboard head dude. Sorry, just cuz I tried to share a urinal with him. Jeez! What's up with that. Some people are so territorial! I'd go here again, for an event, but never, never for a night out. Adios Barcelona!

I went to a fight and a bar broke out.  First time here. With friends after work. Two steroidy, tanned, Max Headroom look alikes get into a major brawl at the table next to us. Seriously. Blood splattered on the wall. Bouncers descended on the unruly cardboard heads like old ladies at the clearance rack at Last Chance. Quickly. And with force.  Second time here. I'm on stage emceeing a male model search contest.  Rinse. Repeat. Yes, two steroidy, tanned Max Headroom look alikes get into a major brawl right by the stage. I hardly noticed until I felt a spilled Long Island Ice Tea seep into my Kenneth Cole monk shoes. And then I saw the bouncers DRAGGING the two lug nuts outside with a trail of blood on the floor. So if you want average drinks with outdated decor and a frat mentality this is SO your place. Otherwise you can witness similar fighting, on your sofa, with a cheap beer, while watching a hockey game.  Cheers!

I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat..... ....at the worst Applebee's in America ....vending machine food ....my own flesh  Now, Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap?   The rainforest "thunderstorm" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink, you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan.

Having lived in California for 15 years I find it funny when a restaurant says it serves California fare. What? Beet salad and seared scallops are only available in California. Warm chocolate cake? Only in the Golden State? Hmmm. Well, what's not funny is how much I enjoyed my food and the attentive and outgoing service we had. And I was delighted at how large the portions were. I was expecting scaled down versions for RW. Kristin S, Rickie and I were here for Arizona Restaurant Week (Ah, c'mon who are we kidding, let's just call it Phoenix Restaurant Week!) and had a fantastic time. My roasted beets were sweet and dee lish. While the sauce with my scallops was a bit too sweet for my tastes, they were cooked perfectly. And as luck would have it, it was half off bottled wines! YAY! Kristin and I sipped a wonderul Sauvignon Blanc that matched my entree perfectly. Rickie's Natural Chicken (WTF? Natural chicken? As oppossed to the chickens with silicon breasts? Now that would be very Californian!) was flavorful but since it was served with the skin on, could have been crispier. Not being a fan of rhubarb I was pretty sure I wouldn't like the cobbler. And. Well. I was right. I made that yucky puckery face you make when you wish you could spit out what you just put in. But I swallowed. Like a lady.

Nestled between the pizza joint and the swanky seafood restaurant off Market St., Blue Wasabi rocks my world. Tiny, tiny, little place. More room on the patio than inside. The everchanging colored panels behind the bar may make your head spin, if like me, you indulge in their fabulous martinis. The rolls are inventive and dee lish. I like the surf and turf with filet mignon and lobster tempura...omg...I'm crying now just thinking of it. The calamari salad is also a must have. The crowd is oh-so North Scottsdale. Lots of white, blond people and a sea of silicon. And I'm talking about the guys! I was a regular here when I lived at DC Ranch, kinda far from my Central Phoenix digs. I think Sundays, if you wear blue, you get half off. If you don't wear blue, they charge you double. No, just kidding. It's worth the drive for the food and fab patio, views of McDowell Mountains. The crowd, however, kinda vacuous and pretentious. Yikes! Origato Yelpers!

You know how you have high expectations of a place. You've even been, but the wait was too long for you at the time. The reviews are off the wall and all your friends love it...but then...you go and are disappointed???  THIS IS SO NOT THE CASE. Cibo was a start for our fabulous evening downtown on my farewelll Phoenix tour (LOL!). We had dinner here before the Madonna concert and it was Fanfreakintastic!   The place was humming with regulars and plenty of Madonna fans. Weather was perfect for al fresco dining. We sat comfortably at a table in back with impeccable service by a new server named Kim. She rocked our meats and cheeses.   Literally. We ordered the appetizer of meat, cheeses, nuts and fruit. For $19 it was really a steal and fed us four Madonna fans well. The homemade mozzeralla was TDF...the proscuitto, bread, olives, goat cheese, grilled veggies...MOUTHGASM!  Of course we had to have a pizza and the Margherita pizza sang to us!!! Crust was perfection, pillowy and crunchy with the soft cheese, tangy sauce and fresh basil.   We were indeed doing the happy food dance. Which was a great excercise as we danced our tails off several hours later. So the food was much needed fuel.   Ambience was as charming as everyone has mentioned.   Cibo. First date. I will squeeze in another if you'll have me. Maybe I'll even kiss you good night and good bye!

I just have one question. Dave, Kristin and Jared...  Did you REALLY like my chilled Patron with fresh fruit shot? Really now. Don't hold back. I have the FEZ Foodie cards for the chef. But what about me? It isn't fair. Isn't that a bad song from the late 80's? I digress. Thanks for showing up y'all!  Hope you had fun.

FYI, I lived for PGP when I was studying at ACI in NYC. Cuz it's so YUM E! Couldn't believe when I lived at DCRanch, there was one right on Market Street. OK, so I haven't had the world famous, controversially long-lined, downtown Pizzeria Bianco yet. But, you know what? I don't think I need to. Cuz Patsy's my pizza passion. Thin crust, tangy sauce and simple and fresh toppings.The staff here is fantastic. Great bar to shoot a couple Patrons while waiting for your to go za. And to think you can get a meal at DCRanch for $15 and be drooling about the next day. Way cool!

Thin and Saucey. Fresh and cold. No I'm not talking about Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton. It's the pizzas and salads at Sauce. I normally don't like the order here, sit down there kinda restaurants. But this place does it right. I'm not going to get into NY vs. Chicago vs. California vs. Tombstone. Save that for a thread, right? I love pizza. So I love them all. Depends on my mood. These pies are delightful. My fave is the sausage and caramelized onion. The potato pizza is hella good. Spinach salad with pine nuts and goat cheese...perfect with my sausage pizza. Service is cheap and the prices are friendly. There's plenty of atmosphere and the parking is light and airy. So get Sauced. Today!

OK, I can never NOT do my Lucky Charm meets Irish Spring accent when I'm here. Not only am I sure I sound imbibed before I even consume my first black and tan, but the staff must surely have heard every Irish accent attempt known to mankind. Love the draft beers here. Love the meatloaf sandwich. Mostly  love the pub atmosphere and what seems to be A LOT of regulars. One particular server is fantastic. A cherubic faced server, not without life lines, complete with a delicious accent. My friend thinks she fakes it. The accent that is. That's fine with me as long as the grub and ale are "magically delicious" and at some point I get to say "manly, yes, but I like it too!"

Cafe Zu Zu...I love Yu Yu! Those were some serious BBQ Burgers I took back to room 6106. Lathered in a perfectly sweet, tangy and mildly peppered sauce with thick slabs of bacon and Vermont cheddar, or was it Wisconsin...not sure...but it was sharp and we all know cheddah makes it bettah! While the mayem and madness of putting together a fashion show unraveled in our room, I sought refuge on our private patio with my new friend (the burger) and it's sidekick (homemade chips!)....I devoured and enjoyed each morsel. The bread was soft and crispy on the edges! Heavenly I say. The signage for Zu Zu is a little Weird Weird...I thought it was Trader Vic's as I saw two signs for TV and none for ZZ! Didn't care, the decor was warm and modern with big puffy cotton ball lighting dotting the ceiling. Hostess and bartender were warm and modern with big puffy cotton balls...oh, wait...I digress...edit...the manager put together my order with a minor mislabeling of medium well and medium rare. Sorry Rickie...I know you don't like the pink spot. Hey. Clean it up yelpitas. I liked the menu I perused while waiting for my chow, enjoyed the decor and service...Cafe Zu Zu easily gets two, two thumbs up I say...Up Up!

Some of my favorite yelpers have been displeased with the antics of one Miss Lisa G. So needless to say I was a bit nervous when meeting Kristin S for lunch recently. Will one of their famous "balls" be hurled at my head if I use the wrong fork? If I take too long to dine will I be ejected by a rogue mob of hospitality lesbians? Upon entering the tiny, sparse yet comfortable space I was immediately greeted and seated. My beverage order was taken quickly and delivered promptly with a smile. Hmmm...now. I'm waiting for Kristin S. Is this where I will be sneered and jeered at by anxious table turning servers? Nope. The menu is limited to sandwiches and salads. Not even a soup. I chose the tuna salad with a Dijon caper dressing...fantastic. Kristin S had the veggie sandwich and said it was good as well. The decor is clean, warm and modern. I could do without the pictures of children on the wall. Really. Was this a day care before? The balls? I guess I'll have to try them next time. Though eating balls made by a lesbian does make me a tad nervous. Lisa G? Gee I think I'll be back.

"Not that there's anything wrong with it..."  My bad. Lisa G is not a card carrying member of the Ellen club. Nope. Straightie through and through. So go to Lisa G and eat her balls.

Copper Star is a star baby. The cutest filling station (yes I said filling station, cuz that's how old this place is) turned coffee house in the oh so trendy hood along 7th Ave. I LOVE THIS PLACE. The owners are a wonderful couple (who frequent my FEZ, thank u very much) and the staff is perky and aromatic. Oh, and so is the coffee. I haven't tried any of the bakery items, but the lattes and coffee are right on the mark sistah. The decor is rec room chic. Lots of sunlight and art dotting the walls. Break the Starbuck's habit people. Support local entrepenuers (ok, I totally don't know how to spell that)...Hey, how about a spell check from the yelp people...sup with that? Anyhoo, tip, trip and sip your way to Copper Star. You'll be glad u did. And so will I.

Complimentary cornbread and donuts.  Nuff said.   OK. There's more! Like the Ronco commercial..."But wait, there's MORE!"  We had trouble finding the front door. Looks it's sweltering hot and our brains were in meltdown. We entered the To Go door which is a very tiny room for take out service only. The lovely employee upon hearing our door troubles said we could come behind the counter and enter the dining room. What? We don't have to go outside again? Love her. She led us right to a perfect table and provided us with menus. Great service! Make it happen!  I was surprised and impressed by the upscale decor. Kind of reminded me of the House of Blues in West Hollywood...made to look like a shack from the outside but quite luxurious inside. Nice.   Our server Kellee was Killer!!! I wanted to snatch her away. Oops, I said snatch. Anyway, the pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese was Bobby Q perfection as was Rickie's brisket sandwich with shoestring fries...the fries...so so yummy! Sweet tea, actually, well, how do you say...should be called super, really, alotta, sweet tea. Sweeter than Paula Deen's pie. Wait. That didn't sound right.   Bobby Q. I wuv you!   P.S. Did I detect a little Velveeta in the mac n cheese? Me thinks so and ME LIKEY!

I'm the nerd who's reviewing a stadium not based on a sporting event but a food show. But hey, that's my life! First off, I hate the name of this place. The University of Phoenix Stadium. In fact, isn't this a college without ANY sports teams? It just doesn't roll off the tongue. Perhaps like BOB, we can call this UPS. Not as un United Parcel Service, but simply UPS! Not that I wanted it to be named Pink Taco, but it sure would have been more interesting. It is huge and fun to drive towards UPS as it shifts on the horizon. First it's on the left. No, wait the right. And then, BOOM there it is. A huge spaceship like structure, in the middle of not so much. For now anyway. Can't imagine what this will look like in even five years. The Shamrock Food show, in itself, is a big event. The stadium floor was perfect for this event. We obviously had plenty of room to sample fried foods, grilled meats, prepared sauces and dressings, dozens of types of tortilla chips, coffees, teas and various to go packaging and sanitizing products. I know. Fascinating. Secretly, I hoped, I would have run in to Matt Leinart. Like, perhaps, in the bathroom. No such luck. But I was impressed by UPS. Perhaps, sometime I will be here as a fan and not a general manager. And maybe, the name will change by then. Like, Big Ass Glendale Stadlum (BAGS). Or FEZ Stadium. I know. Self indulgent. Or Yelp Stadium. I know. Ass kisser. Bring it on Super Bowl!!!!!!

I know Macy's has become sort of an upscale JCPenny. Sort of a really organized Tj Maxx. Perhaps they've lost some of they're luster in the department store mega wars. I still get a kick out of the flagship store at Herald Square in Manhattan. CRAMMED with New Yorkers all riding the old rickety wooden escalators. But here in shiny, pristine Biltmore Fashion Park, is my Macy's. OK, our Macy's. I can't tell you how many times I've lucked out with clothes marked 50% off only to be discounted another 40%. WOW! Items by Just 4 You, Hugo Boss and Kenneth Cole. Yea, I know they're they ugly little step cousins of D & G, Prada and Versace. But hey, my credit cards can only take so much. But be patient. The cashiers, all registered members of AARP, due tend to drag a little. Once, I literally saw an employee's hair turn a few shades grayer while watching her s l o w l y scan my purchases.

Holy Ricky Martin! Me gusto this restaurante! Seriously mis amigos y amigas. Entering Tradiciones is an elevating experiencia. Like entering Disneyland. Es imposible not to be muy feliz.. You get me papi? Waitresses in frilly dresses with big smiles on their caras bonitas. A dining room lleno de color, energia and muy clean. Like spotless. You get mi papi? Carnitas was tender and served with homemade tortillas...Dios Mio! Homemade. Thicker than the ones us gringos are used to. And mucho mejor. You get  mi papi? Fajitas, margaritas, watermelon juice, salsa and service all first rate. So, two thumbs up from this gringo and his novio latino. We we're both treated as las reinas that we are. I hope Tradiciones becomes a tradition of ours. You get mi papi?

When I was a kid I loved the TV show Hotel starring James Brolin (before he became Mr. Streisand). I was fascinated by hotels. So much that I wanted to live in a hotel. Room service. Chocolate on the pillow. Beds that vibrate for a quarter. Well, I didn't always say they were nice hotels. While I don't live in a hotel, I practically live at The Clarendon.  Things I have done at The Clarendon. And I can't list everything because my mother reads my reviews...  Slept in perhaps the most comfortable bed in the world.  Attended a rockin' Halloween party dressed as, c'mon, guess...Yep...Hello Kitty. Attended photo shoots. Had drinks by that glorious pool and waterfall. Watched the sunset on the fabulous rooftop patio.  Become a regular (yep, they even know my name!) at Gallo Blanco. Had dozens of extremely happy out of town visitors stay here.  Enjoyed the men's urinals shaped like big red lips. Dried my hands on that amazing Dyson hand dryer (insert hands for 12 seconds and they're drier than a Napa Brut) Left my beloved bomber jacket at GB and retrieved it the next day...honest, honest employees.  Great staff from hotel to restaurant. Attentive. Friendly. Professional. I want to move somewhere else just so I can go on vacation and stay at The Clarendon. But. Wait. I don't have to. I can simply cross the street from my pad and enjoy this fabulous Phoenix gem.   PM for the R rated version. Chow.

Like Minneapolis & St. Paul. Like Cagney & Lacey. Like Nip & Tuck. Olive & Ivy is beautiful and near some water, entertaining and lesbian friendly and full of people who've had plastic surgery. Great space. Fabulous patio. I know. I know. The canal. Ugh. Love it? Hate it? Hey, it's there people. Embrace it! Like the Brady's did cousin Oliver.  And embrace the Eggs Benedict, Egg Sandwich, Focacciao bread with pesto and CENTER CUT CINNAMON ROLLS! You heard me people! Center cut. No non glazed, hardened, corner piece. Service was outstanding. I noticed the patio filled up just after we arrived. Isn't that weird? Does that ever happen to you? You arrive somewhere. Nothing. Soon the place is buzzing and so are you? Anyway. I digress. We were thirsty fashionistas recovering after a night at Scottsdale Fashion Week...i.e. we were pickled and thirsty. Ice tea and water was a flowin' the entire meal. They saw it in our blood shot eyes I'm sure. Eggs Benedict was perfection and had a delightful surprise of basil on top! Rickie LOVED his egg sandwich with avocado...looked great...though he never offered me any...Hmmm..Olive & Ivy. Like Ebony & Ivory. Living together in perfect harmony. Side by side....ok ok ok you get the picture.

Hot. Cheesey. Fresh. No, I'm not talking about the guests at the opening gala to Phoenix fashion week. We're talking 'bout the cheesesteaks and chicken cheesesteaks we chowed down on after the event. I got  so hungry looking at those skinny models all night. I was this close to nibbling on one's boney thigh. The only thing better than eating these scrumptuous works of art, was having them delivered to the terrace at Hotel Indigo. Yes people. Delivered. Right to our drunken butts. On the terrace. At Hotel Indigo. And how fantastic it is that you choose Cheese Whiz, American or Provelone.? I'm all about the Whiz! How cool and funny and useful is that?

Could this store BE any smaller (said in my best Chandler Bing voice)? I seriously walked in with Rickie, stayed 90 seconds, and said "Dude, I gotta git outta here!" Fortunately they had a guitarist/singer on the back patio with a coffee pot full of java and some cookies. How cool is that? Said musician was eventually joined by a little girl who played her clarinet. Played is being kind. Poor thing. That clarinet squeaked more than the brakes on my 95 ghetto beemer. More than Peter Brady's voice during puberty. But how cute it was. How very Bohemian. Rickie scored The Knife CD he's been looking for and the staff was VERY helpful and not all weird slacker don't bother me cuz I'm too cool to move from behind the counter cuz I just know you two queers are looking for Brittney Spears or Madonna crap and that is so lame...NO...not at all. Nicest of nice. And we were cool. Besides. I'd never heard of The Knife. That was always my nickname for OJ. And he WAS not there. Oh. Cuz he's in jail! HA HA! Anyway, I digress. Stinkweeds! Neither stinky. Nor weedy! Check it 08 my yelpitas. Love you!!!!!

Arf arf...bow wow..lick lick...Ok, that was Emilie our Schnauzer's take on Wag N Wash and believe me she loves it there. Right there across from Copper Star Coffee sits my beloved Wag N Wash. The owners and staff are the nicest of nice. I want to just hang out there with them all day. Cept for the fact that I usually leave with random dog hair attached to my tounge. They have a sort of Ben and Jerry's anti Petco mentatlity and I respect that. They have a great stock of toys, treats and other poochie gucci things. The grooming service is fantastic. Forty bucks for a 90 minute groom is quite a deal. Cut to me trying to bathe Emilie in my tub and the ensuing waterworks flooding my bathroom floor. Me cussing, spilling my martini. Emilie constantly violently shaking excess shampoo and water all over the walls. Not pretty. Also provided is a self washing area. Well, not self washing as in you wash yourself, cuz, well that would be weird. But an area where you yourself can wash your dog. They provide with an apron, brush, shampoos, etc. and constantly check on you. And I can never leave without purchasing their homemade doggie treats, kinda pricey at $10 for a bag, but their made right there in front of ya and I love supporting the smaller business. So wag your tail bitches and get on down to the WNW.

The English muffin of vintage stores. Nooks and crannies everywhere. So many, you make a wrong turn, you could be impaled by a broken Betty Boop lamp. Qcumber. I have to say. It's a Qcute name. But it's not Qcuite for  me. You see. When I enter a store. I think my shoes, upon leaving, shouldn't be dirtier than when I arrived at your store. So Qcumber. I just have two words for you...  Buy a broom and start sweeping for Qcryin' out loud!

Neiman Marcus meet Salvation Army. Salvation Army meet Neiman Marcus. Nice.   Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s.   Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude.   Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.    Flo. I love you! So glad you found another gig after Mel's. And for those who aren't a fan of Flo's.   KISS MY GRITS!

Old school yo!  We're talking salad bar with beets, sunflower seeds and cottage cheese yo!  We're talking prime rib of Flintstonian proportions!   I met a group of good friends here recently. We were seated in a back (non window) room and my claustrophobia almost got the best of me. It was a pretty tiny room. Soon I decided it wasn't tiny. It was cozy. And soon the Coronas were a- comin' and the conversation was flowing.  Our server, a delightful woman, was efficient and friendly. And a shout out to her just for handling a group of a dozen or so yelpers! Can you imagine waiting on us lol!?!?  My prime rib and baked potato were pure perfection. The salad bar was fresh and fully loaded.   Much like myself towards the end of the evening.  The decor is all muraled-out if memory serves me. So there's a lot going on!   So Feeney's you got a new fan! Great place to take my folks, out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm!!!  Yo!

Major life accomplishments: Not vomiting during Cloverfield. Puberty. Finding Lost Leaf Seriously. Nestled among other small houses, sits the Lost Leaf. No signage that I could see. No address. Minimal lighting. That just makes it even cooler. Recently met some friends there for Jacqui's birthday and we had a blast. Y'all know so much about this place already. But did you know the big painting in the main room is kinda scary after a large Bastard beer. Check the third dude. His eyes follow you. And if you forget your debit card and call to ask them just to cut it up for you, he says he's required to say aloud and back to you, "Sir, you have just asked me to cut up your debit card. Is this what you want me to do?" Uh, yea. I strangely appreciated that. No table service that I know of, just crawl up to the bar when your Bastard is empty. Live music from the back room is a great touch and plays throughout the house. Full of urbanites, hipsters, scenesters and this night tipsy, silly, photo snapping yelpers. Lost Leaf. You're lost no more.

Hot Things (with Prince's Hot Thing playing in your head):  Christopher Meloni (Hello? Have you seen him in Oz?) Glee (C'mon you know you love it!) Betty White's career!  HOT HOT HOT!!! Phoenix is hot. Mercury is hot. Phoenix Mercury is SMOKING HOT! I've had the privilege to meet many of the players and the folks behind the scenes and they are professional, courteous and most of all FUN!!!  The energy and the entertainment at the Mercury games is unlike and energy I've experienced. I've attended hundreds of sporting events throughout my jock heavy life and the Mercury games are infectious. Like laughter. Not poison ivy.   So here's to the WNBA Champs! A five star organization from back of the house to the court. GO MERCURY!!!

I like this park. Rickie hit a home run in this park. Just. For. Me.   I like this park. It has trees for shade. Though I would like this park more if they had WAY more trees. I would like this park more if the concrete bleachers were covered. And how about some hot dog vendors!? Beer? The ice cream guy just wasn't cutting it!  I like this park because softball wives are allowed in the dugout during the game. Yep. Covered. With a bench. Cold water. Ha! All the saps out in the sun, melting like Melanie Griffith's face.   Really though the road leading to this park is pretty ghetto and lined with trailer parks, piles of cars and piles of tires. So I was not looking forward to the park. What a surprise. Very clean. HUGE. Great parking. Restrooms...not too bad...I mean it's not The Plaza but there was soap and working hand dryers.   I like Cesar Chavez Park. I'm returning Sunday. Where Rickie will hit yet another home run. Just. For. Me.

There's just something funny about a white guy and his latin boyfriend noshing on soul food in the desert. But what's not funny is how dee lish the food is here at Lil Mama's. And how fun just to say lil. Perhaps the two t's and the e at the end put them over on their sign budget. But I like it. Lil Thomas likes it. The enormous serving of fried chicken was crisp and succulent. Yes, I said succulent. How many of you have used that word today? Side of red beans and rice were faboo. Five stars to the mac and cheese and collard greens. The smothered chops were not my fave and I would try another main dish. Perhaps the catfish? Huge tumblers of sweet tea to chase down this caloric feast hit the spot. The space is sparce with vintage looking  African American art. I noticed a performace space near the front window. The ham in me wanted to jump up there and do the Steve Martin front porch dance from The Jerk.

Like the 80s group ABC sang "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"... But hurt in a good way (you know, like nice, naughty spanking) and not bad hurts like the sound of Lindsay Lohan's voice. Are we clear? I was an Urban Studies/Architecture major in college and I love this whole 50s style meets mid modern meets Scottsdale. From the lobby to the grounds to the pool to our charming, color splashed, glass brick adorned room, this was a major score in the Staycation category. I was initially intimidated by the pool crowd as I noticed NOBODY was actually IN the pool. Just posing around the pool. Were they looking at my pasty white Scandinavian skin? My extremely, freakishly small nipples? Or the Hello Kitty towel I brought from home? Hmmm..fBack to the room....the glass brick divided the room from the shower...and what a fabulous shower. Nice, big, pulsating head. Honestly, I'm not trying to go all pg13 on ya! Bed and bedding were cozy and spotless. A great place to crash after Rickie's headlining collection at Phoenix Fashion Week. The room was at one point spacious enough to accommodate Mr. Gonzales, the stylist, the assistant and anywhere from three to eight models. I was comfy on our fabulous bed with a glass of wine watching it all unravel in front me. Who needs TV? It was very entertaining. And when I needed to escape we had our own private patio. Wait? Wasn't that a B52s song? So Valley Ho...you are hip. But you're also great deal. A great venue. And yes, maybe even, OK, I"m getting a little vaklempt, a great friend....

And open letter to the Esplanade Theaters:  Dear Mr. or Ms. Esplanade I enjoy your theaters. They are close to my home. And close to many restaurants and shops. Although I have to say the actual shops and restaurants at the Esplanade. Well, they suck. Except for Houstons. The choices of businesses and the horrible signage sends everyone scurring across the street. Yea, that's right. To the Biltmore. Just thought you should know. Your seats are comfortable and generally pretty dang clean. And your crazy concession prices. I don't even mind. It's like the crazy drink prices at the airport. I always expect it and actually enjoy overspending for some strange reason. Just part of the experience I guess.  I really just have one other thing to say Esplanade people: FIX THOSE DAMN ESCALATORS!!!!! IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A FREAKIN HIKE BEFORE AND AFTER MY MOVIE I'D GO TO CAMELBACK MOUNTAIN!  Thank you for your time.  Most Sincerely, Thomas S.

This isn't so much an In n Out review, which I will touch on, but more of an update to a previous Simonmed review (based on an MRI I required). I don't know what MRI stands for but I'm sure it's not something positive or cheerful like Monkey Reads Incyclopedia....Ok Ok...I know it's not spelled correctly...I mean, who really knows how to spell monkey. What I'm saying is that I had GREAT results from my MRI (which I've reviewed along with Dr. Fry who delivered the relieving and wonderful news) and the first "naughty" reward I thought of was an In N Out burger. I discovered and devoured them in LA for 16 years and in Phoenix they are more difficult to find. Thank you intersection of FLW and Scottsdale Blvd (further know as ScottsBull). After leaving Dr. Fry's Airpark Medical Center in NoScott with good news I needed something toxic....nicotine, alchohol, perhaps something illegal or, oh, red meat....that's still legal, I think. Burger was amazing. Bun was soft and crisp and buttery where needed, lettuce, tomato an onion were crispier than a November wind blowing off Lake Michigan (pre greenhouse effect) and the accompanying soda hit the spot. Truly, with that 1,000 island sauce action, this was my fast food heaven. And, I forgot how much I LOVE Amercian cheese. Fast food service was impeccible. Clean grounds. And better yet, the cyst on my kidney was A OK....ooo what a subtle ending! Thanks to those yelpers who voiced, er, umm typed their concerns!

Animal Style? Squeeze me? I've been chowing down In N Out burgers for more than two decades. Yep. When Courtney had a Hole. And Friends was refreshing and not annoying. And Presidents received oral sex in the oval office. Yes, that long! But I didn't know about Animal Style on my double double...extra "special sauce", grilled onions, pickles all fried up in mustard on a flat girl. Um. I mean flat grill. Animal Style? Yep. I would seriously get down on all fours for this baby!

I was an Urban Studies major in college.  I had a huge cowboy crush on John Travolta in Urban Cowboy.  And now...Urban Cookies! Big crush!   We give them out to our staff and the packaging and cookie selection is urban outstanding. It makes them very happy. I love the Urban Cookie which in additon to chocolate has coconut and walnut. And like the lovely, smart and delicious Christine O says, the Urban Tropical is most unique and flavorful. Well, kinda like Christine!  Organic. Locally owned. They plant trees. I mean c'mon. How green and eco friendly can they get?  So use your cookies on this one yelpers and get yourself some cookies. You will feel very urban. Scouts honor.

Oh, the hunt for the perfect sofa. IKEA? For my sofa? I think not. Craigslist? Garage Sales? Ewwww....you never know what or who peed on it. Robb and Stucky? Probably overpriced and TOTALLY not my style. Crate & Barrel, Restoration Hardware, Copenhagen. Yea, I sat, cuddled and drooled on several at these places. But, $2800 to $3600 was a little out of my range. Like by thousands of dollars. Rickie and I like contemporary furniture for the most part. And we wanted an L shaped sectional with a chaise. Enter my friend Jennifer. No, really, my friend Jennifer came over and mentioned Jennifer Convertibles. I laughed in her face, HA HA! It seemed so pedestrian. So suburban. So, well, so you Jennifer. Would I have my gay card revoked if I got our sofa from a mini mall location? Why it's neighbors are a Subway and a check cashing place for God's sake! But when I swung the doors open and I saw Sofie (I named it Sofie. Sofie the Sofa), it was love at first sight. I heard her microfiber cushions call it, "Sit on me Thomas! Sit on me". So I did. And for $799, I've been sitting, cuddling and drooling on her for quite a while. Will it last forever? I hope not. Who wants one sofa for the rest of their life? Great service. Great prices. And, I met my Sofie!:)

"Exit to lef" Every time I hear this, I'm thinking, "There's a t at the end of left! A t for God sakes"! Then I calm down and fixate on the homeless man rubbing his feet.  While I'm glad I don't have to rely on public transportation to get work (I walk actually), I LOVE having it in my hood. I've taken it to the movies, to get a haircut and to the movies and to get a haircut. OK. So I haven't used it that much.   Trains arrive, it seems, in 10 to 15 minute intervals. Trains are (so far) extremely clean. I miss the advertising however, like in NYC. I want posters about STD's and community colleges. Gimme something to look at.   Besides the homeless man's toes.

The ultimate java drive through joint! Coffee is aromatic and sturdy. Much like my Aunt Miriam in Berkley. Staff is SO friendly and accommodating. I've never been inside, so as far as I know they are only torsos serving me. I've had the breakfast burrito and it was perfect for eating in the car. Yes, I was driving and eating. Bad driver! Bad! At least I wasn't texting! A couple of times I've had our dog with me and they always throw in a Scooby snack for Emilie. This is the obvious alternative to Starsucks. And if the line gets too long, they come out in person to take orders and get your morning liquid bean fix started!

I've lived in Phoenix for six years and have been to Chandler twice! It was to time visit again as Rickie needed clothes for an NTUIT video shoot. I thought I would hang out, play some bric braker and sneak into the Greek restaurant next door and buck up to the bar. Hey. Don't judge. It's my day off!  But I couldn't leave PC...  I'm back in the "closet" again! Yep! Full on in the closet, well dressed and smiling! Contrary to the four other reviews I found the store to be well organized (cramped yes, but hey, retail space is expensive and this isn't a pricey boutique serving lattes), staffed with friendly and helpful people and I LIKED the energetic music pumping throughout the store.   I saw Polo, Lacoste and Abercrombie and Fitch. But I snagged three pairs of shorts and three t shirts for $50! That's like $8 an item. Much better than Buffalo Exchange. Did I find Dolce or Prada. Nope! But I wasn't looking for it. I needed summer threads and Plato's Closet nailed it!  So I'm in the closet again (like so many of our Republican politicians). Happy. Well dressed and ready for summer! Me happy. Me wallet is happy.

If I hadn't already fallen in love and married Rickie, this would be my mother's second choice.  Holy Casserole! She loves this place. This place will seduce even the most novice of chefs. From the best spatulas in the world (yes, I said the world) to the special stove top cleaner my mother needs that's only available here, SLT, has everything but the kitchen sink. Pun, brutally intended. And as Rhonda J reviewed, the knife section is mesmerizing. And if you've ever used a quality knife and then used, oh I don't know, some piece of crap from Ikea, you will NEVER go back. You may as well slice that cucumber with a rubber band. Great staff. Great inventory. And it makes mama happy. And if mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy. Hmmm...isn't that a refrigerator magnet somewhere? Bon apetit yelpers!

"Thank you for calling Cox Communications. My name is Melika. How may I assist you today?" "Hello Melika. I'd like pay the minimum on our cable bill please." "OK sir. I would be happy to assist you with this today. May I please have your PIN." "I have no idea what our PIN is. I"m sorry. What other information may I give you." "The social security number for the primary customer." "Oh, well that's my partner and I'm not sure what it is. I have our address, phone number, our account number..." "Yes sir, well I do understand that you have that information, I will not be able to assist you." "OK Melika. Look honey. I'm trying to GIVE you money. I'm not changing my plan or even making fun of your dumb ass company yet. Just wanna GIVE you money." "Without your PIN or social security number I cannot tell you the minimum due but I can take a payment." "Oh. Well now we're getting somewhere. Melika. By the way, we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us." "Thank you sir for you payment. And, yes, I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day." Two days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't "choose" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!

Why am I seduced by fast food sometimes? Is it because I work in a full service restaurant and can eat wonderful food anytime I want? Or because I crave something processed that's laden in grease and riddled with sodium? Or is it because my bf texts me and says hey, pick up arby's? I order the number five for bf and see a delicious looking sandwich staring at me. I mean what a photo! Who took this photo? Annie Leibovitz? It's perfect looking. Turkey and Swiss on some fresh looking bread with plump tomatoes and crisp lettuce. How bad can it be? Well. Hmmm. So bad. You spit it out in a napkin and scrape your tongue with a pumice stone. Gargle with Listerine and vow to the heavens to limit your fast food to In N Out and the Philadelphia Sandwich Company. Arby's Shmarby's. Gross.

NOTE: I meant to review the one at Indian School just west of Central!  QT. I don't even know what the Q or the T means. But this place beats 7-11 and AM PM hands down. Huge parking area. Lots of gas pumps. Assorted bums and snot faced teens. Uber friendly and uber efficient staff. Clean. Clean. Clean. Free air and water for your car. Those yummy Totino frozen pizzas. Every kind of Dorito known to mankind. Assorted bums and snot faced teens. And really, the staff, English speaking. As a first language. I don't mean that as a racist remark, it's just nice when you're in a hurry, and your'e just trying to get your Tecate, Frito's and Bubble Yum and there's no communication barrier. QT. My little convienent cutey store. Oh, hey, maybe that's what it means. Hmmm....

When I first moved to Phoenix I lived by PV Mall. I had nothing better to do then lounge by the pool, shop at the mall and wait for my roomie to call to meet him for happy hour. So one day I met him at Ra at Kierland. It reminded me of my Fisher Price little peole village I played with when I was six. Ok, seven. Alright, I played with it well into junior high! Wow! Hello Kierland. Good bye PV Mall. I love the street side parking and the upscale/small town look. I love that they have a French Connection and that candy store! I would have lunch at North and then hit the shops. A great place to stroll around, people watch and increase your debt!

The armpit of my local grocery stores. Freak show central. How many people actually have to grocery shop on those little "Scooter" things. Toothless people, smelly people, people with lots of facial hair..and those are the women. And it's toooo freakin big. A third of it is stocked with lawn chairs, fans and pool accessories. I'M LOOKING FOR FOOD! I only stopped there recently cuz I was dropping DVDs off at Blockbuster. BIG MISTAKE....The entry is filthy. The carts wobble more than Lindsay Lohan after a late night Les Deux binge. And the stench of urine isn't the best greeting for a market. Ultimately it was when my cart was "mistakingly" taken from me by the bearded lady and her Scooter husband that I ran my ass out of there and drove to Safeway. Ahhhh Safeway. Even the name is better. Safe. Way. Fry's??? Dumb name. Nasty store.

Booooo Booooo! I'm NOT a StarYucks patron. Really. I'm not. However some evil friend gave me a StarYucks gift card and of course I had to use it. So. I tried. I don't do the half caf, part skim, part whole, chai, with light chocolate sprinkles venti grande tallie or whatever. I truly  hate those people. But I did request a soy latte. They were out of soy. Hmmm...Ok. I run a restaurant, I understand running out of products. Next day, same StarYucks. Same drive thru. Same monster in the window. Soy Latte please. Sorry, no soy milk. Oh for crap sake. This StarYucks is 200 yards from a grocery store. That sells soy and other market goods. So I peeled out, went to Lux, and my world was at peace. Once again.

Things I love about this Fry's:  The cute, slow little old people. The huge parking lot with the temptation of a Taco Bell within. The great selection of spendy La Brea Bakery Bread. Wednesday's. The vast inside with everything but the kitchen sink. Fresh lobster?! The cute, slow little old people.   Things I hate about this Fry's:  The cute, slow little old people.

A brave scholar once said, "There is no such thing as bad pizza. Some are better and some are worse. But pizza, ahh, pizza is amore". When I first met Z, that's what I call her. Just Z. She seemed so familiar. She smelled familiar. Looked familiar. Better yet. She tasted familiar. Whether a whole pie, in all it's tomato sauce glory, delivered to my front door. Or two tangy, cheesy (award winning Wisconsin cheese mind you...which is cool....but is the cheese awards part of the upcoming awards season? And if so, what will I wear to the red, er, um would it be yellow carpet? Not sure) tempting and tantalizing triangles that I eat in with a cold Stella Artois for a mere $7.25. Service is friendly. The cute, arty dining room cozy, airy and light. Kinda like a breezy, California dining room. California? Hey, that's it. Z Pizza. Dee lish. Inovative. Fresh. California. Laguna Beach. Bingo. I had my first Z experience, I was d-zeed shall we say, after a dance a thon at the Boom Boom Room in Laguna Beach in the late 80s. Nice to see you Z. Glad we can hang once again!

You rawk my chain Z. Can I call you Z? Like when I'm hanging with Oprah and I call her O. She gets a kick out of that. Listen. You goofed up a little a few weeks ago and omitted the sausage on my pizza. I was cranky and rattled off an email to corporate. Just cuz it wasn't the first time. And, well, it was my time of the month. I'm in the biz so I wrote a constructive, non-cursing email. Not only did I hear back from the owner...turns out we hang in the same circle. So, last night I took advantage of a discount, ordered my za, spoke with a very cool, helpful manager and got the pizza of my dreams delivered. Along with some sweets from Pink Spot...see review below...pizza and ice cream sandwiches...DELIVERED...in Phoenix...merits and update, a shout out and when I win my Academy Award, I will mention you. Z. Later.

Well of course you're named after a Saint. After all, you are simply heavenly! I LOVED my visit to St. Francis. Just like I loved the first year of Charlie's Angels when Farrah was on. Just like I loved Chachi and not Joanie. Just like I love smooth and not chunky. I was honored to have a tour of St. Francis by Mr. Aaron Chamberlain himself. He pointed out the architectural details and history of his career. Right down to family serving spoons used in his grandparents restaurant embedded in to the brick near the front door. The sleek, glass garage door which opens up to Camelback. If you're sitting outside you have a panoramic view of the interior and if you're inside you get a bird's eye view of the street scape.   The second story (which is in limbo and awaiting a mural and a more defined purpose) is structurally held in place by a "V" shaped collection of steel rods...unfreakinreal! The birch floors on the stairs, the gravel on the patio, the maple beams, the seemless glass front table...I'm having an interior design orgasm!   Oh. The food? Yep! Yummers! Thin crust pizzas with a airy, pillow crust...tried an arrugula za and had one with figs! The signature salad with a homemade buttermilk dressing (DON'T THINK RANCH!)...it's so much more and the goat cheese brulee made my mouth, my tummy and my soul very happy! You can feel the love from the kitchen as well as an attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff.  You're like my foodie angel, arriving in CenPho to save fme rom Applebee's and Sweet Tomatoes! I say Halo St. Francis. Halo and welcome to the hood!

Thank you St. Francis. You saintly one you. We had a motley crew roll in last month to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of my 29th Birthday. We had a large sort of half booth half chair kinda table near the kitchen door. Well, the party grew bigger and bigger. Kinda like Kevin Federline's stomach and ass. Well our server, management and the host team made sure we were comfortable and never gave off the "dayum you big party" vibe. Food was outstanding. Specifically the starter salad and the pizza! Drinks were spot on and the Patron was a flowin'!  I just had to update. I hope St. Francis (aka Aaron Chamberlain) reads yelp and sees this cuz I have to say "I love you man! I really love you".

Oh. St. Francis. You are the wind beneath my wings. You truly are king of the world. You complete me.  And yes, yes, indeed you had me at hello. Kitty. Sorry. Couldn't resist  Ate here last night with my folks and my visiting bro and his beau. Everything was absolutely outstanding. With a shout out to our server and I'm completely bummed I don't remember  her name. Though I'm happy to report my dad made a point to tell the manager how fabulous she was.  Flatbread. Roasted chicken. Roasted veggies with goat cheese. Pork chop. Ribeye. And the famous green chile pork stew.  I love you more than my luggage. Drink your juice Shelby. Hit her Weezer! Hit her.   Go. To. St. Francis.

Ker plop. Yes. The sound a cell phone makes when plunging into the abyss of my toilet. I wont scare you with the details of who/what/when/why, well, you know where, of this debaucheries accident. And I thought I'd be cool. You know for a few days without the cell. Why I remember rotary for God's sake. I don't NEED my cell. Well, by day three went I started the with drawl shakes. Sweating profusely from my brow and unable to eat solid foods, I checked in with Sprint (and called Betty Ford's new tech unit) to get a time frame on my replacement. Only a few more weeks. It's on back order. OH! I DID NOT KNOW THAT! Since I'm insured, I'm positive I can get a "loaner" phone. No? Well, great. So, I had to BUY a phone and then return it(which went smoothly FYI). But I was not impressed. All those cell phones floating around there, and you can't loan me one. Piss off.

Costco my ass! Shamrock Foods makes Costco look like an out of stock roadside fruitstand. This place is massive. Larger than Rosie O'Donnell's head. Larger than Gordon Ramsay's ego. Larger than, well, larger than, um, damn, I can't think of a third pop culture "larger than" reference. Let's just say it has three addresses. Now, it's not exactly a fair comparison as Shamrock isn't open to the general public. Just us restaurant kin. But there are other food vendors, i.e Sysco, that just don't stack up. Stack up? Ha, like pancakes! A food reference in my food vendor review. When will the fun stop? Fantastic customer service. Always ready with will call items that were missed in our pre-order. And Richard? A god in the industry....always taking care of my place and insuring I get my hundreds of fresh Angus beef patties, heads of iceberg lettuce and thousands of strawberries. And that little tomato scare last month? They were swift in their investigation, communication and information. Shamrock Foods. Larger than a "biiiiiig stickkkk of buttttah!!!" Yea, that's it!

How I didn't review this as 5 stars the first time around is beyond me. Bad, Bath and Beyond me!  So FIVE stars to Shamrock Foods. Course it doesn't hurt I'm going on an all expense luxury 5 day vacation to Washington DC, with digs at the Ritz Carlton, a gala ball at the Mellon Auditorium, a private dinner at the National American History Museum...the list goes on!  Thank you Shamrock. You rock. You Sham! And you rock!

I'd give them five stars if it was free...but naturally, it's SO expensive to have anything done here. My MRI, by the time I'm finished, will be over $2,000! I would so rather buy clothes, go to Tahiti or highlight my dog's hair then spend it on an MRI. But, health comes first. The actual location I visited is at 3rd St. and Virginia. Bar none, it is the nicest, most comfortable and duly appointed medical facility I've ever been to...including Cedars Sinai in L.A. Leather sofas, fantastic artwork and cookies!!! Even the room where I had my MRI was like a freakin hotel suite with furniture and paintings. It was very soothing which I needed cuz I was about to be strapped to a conveyer belt and run through a tube slightly larger than me! My tech was awesome, I listened to music and he was able to speak to me through a wired microphone so I didn't feel too trapped. Front desk help was extremely helpful and friendly. When they saw my jaw drop after announcing my "tab", one receptionist quickly said, "Oh, if you can't pay in full today Mr. Smith, we could set up a payment plan." LOVE YOU RECEPTIONIST LADY! Anyway I hope ya'll don't need such medical attention, but if you do Simonmed is your team. Cheers to good health fellow yelpers!

Watergate. Troopergate. Westgate.  Ugh! Seriously. It's like City Walk in Universal City, CA had an ugly step sister. Like City Walk is Marcia and Westgate is Jan. I mean really people. It's always Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. Well, she was prettier for God's sake. And here in Glendale, we have Jan.... Awkward Bad signage Pedestrian retailers Chain restaurants with UNINSPIRED employees Parking lots arranged by, oh, I don't know, Helen Keller  I thought this might be the reason to lure my snooty CenPho ass to the westside. But. No. Still the only reason to trek up the 101 is still mom and dad in Sun City. And the parking in their driveway is a breeze.

Bar Smith, a sleek and urban find in downtown Phoenix is fabulana. Reminds me of many a haunts you'd find me (drooling and slouched over the bar) in Manhattan. First time there we sat at the bar with a friendly, yet overly informational, bartender. He basically revealed who on the staff had been fired and why (oh my, drug use you say...unheard of in the restaurant business!), how the owners don't pay well...blah blah blah. He was however helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. John had a burger that was meaty and juicy (like his first girlfriend in middle school back in Jersey he says), Monika had a chicken sandwich while I was daring and had a fish (I believe cat) sandwich. Mine was great, I would skip the cheese next time as it takes over the mildness of said fish. We enjoyed an app of sausage fondue....scarey good. So good you don't care if your friend says there's a string of cheese dangling from your lip to nipple, you just want to keep on eating. Second time we all went, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and that was very flavorful and tender. A/C wasn't always up to speed and I found myself dabbling my brow quite a bit. How positively unseemly!! But seriously, a great, great place...ya'll should head down there tonight!

My ode to Estelle Getty: Picture this. Scottsdale. Hotel Indigo pool.  A middle aged gay man holding a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc runs to make a photo opp at Rickie's fashion show. He didn't realize the three svelt female models with air bags for breasts were nude. Naked. Sin ropa! Nada lotta! Except for their bikini-painted bodies. Yes. Body paint.  By the pool. Me. Them. Slippery floor. Slippery glass of wine.  As the photo is being snapped, I find myself losing my balance and I think, as I was going down with the wine, I should grab on to someone's clothing. To brace my fall. In front of hundreds.  Well. They're nude. There is nothing to grab onto. Me and the wine go down spilling wine on all three of the models. Causing their body paint to start streaking! SNAP goes the photo.  Oh. Hotel Indigo? The services? Valet guy parked my car. Hostess greeted me. Bartender overserved me. The models hated me.  Good times...

Old school Italian restaurant located on the first floor of a Central Ave. high rise, Alexi's delivers great food with great service. The room is nicely appointed (nicely appointed?...who says things like that?), comfortable and really reminds me of an upper westside NYC restaurant. Pasta pomodoro, shrimp parmigiana, minestrone soup, house salad all dee lish. It reminds of an NYC restaurant. Hostess in a tight dress. Waitresses all with big hair. Older waiters, follicly challenged and oddly all with moustaches. Naked Cowboy on the sidewalk. Ok, maybe not THE naked cowboy. But one day I did see a cowboy type with daisy dukes and a muscle shirt that read "My belt buckle's bigger than yours". Hmmm. Anyway, the clientele seems to be older Scottsdale type, women in furs and men with furry backs, who dare to venture into Central Phoenix. Me? I show up in my board shorts, Hello Kitty flip flops and a muscle shirt that says "My debt is bigger than yours". ENJOY yelpers!

I know I'm gonna love a place when I hear upon entering, "Hello there honey, how ya'll doin?" LOVE YOU LADY BEHIND COUNTER. LOVE YOU! I mean how fun can it be to work at a light bulb store. Apparently big fun, cuz everyone there is very friendly and helpful. As I'm waiting for her to look up the part I need for my track light (I know, track lighting, how very 80s of me and how very gay) I'm overwhelmed by how many choices we as American consumers have in the light bulb world. You might say a light bulb went off in my head. WOW! Different shapes, colors, sizes, wattages, volts....lions and tigers and bears oh my! I really do highly recommend this business. Family owned and right now I feel like their favorite cousin. You know like Oliver on the Brady Bunch. Whatever happend to Oliver? Hmmm...he'll probably show up on Celebrity Fit Club. And scene...

THE NEW AND IMPROVED AFTER THE ROOF CAVED IN SAFEWAY: How can Goldie Hawn get cuter? How can Phoenix get hotter? How can Hello Kitty be appealing and collectible to a white, middle aged gay man in his 40's? How can Safeway be ANY better? Well, it is. Better feng shui. FIVE STARS YELPERS. FIVE STARS! Going grocery shopping was like totally my favorite thing to do with my mom when I was a kid. That way I got to pick out all the good cereals and snacks and then hide them from my siblings. To this day I still enjoy the market. Safeway (aka Gayway), cuz you know, we sistahs just love to shop for fresh pasta, Odwalla juices and Lucky Charms on Osborn is fantastic. Great produce, wine selection and a hunky butcher to boot. Something about a man drizzled in blood weilding a cleaver that I enjoy. Hmmm...issues! Employees are friendly and helpful. They must have secret shoppers, cuz I swear if you so much as just partially glance at one of them you get the obligatory "Hi, how are you? Are you finding everything ok? Would you like me to show you? Can I floss your teeth for you?" and on and on. But I appreciate it nonetheless. This Safeway is open til 1am which is a plus since I usually work until 10 pm or so.

Nothing wurst than a bad weenie. No bun intendend. But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog. A Chicago hot dog at that. In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold. But I ain't in the Windy City. I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City. And I didn't know where to go. And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign! That was it. That's what I needed. The universe had answered my calling. You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly. Yea. Well I didn't listent to my gut. Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming. The place wasn't clean. Ok, it was dirty. Stained floors, rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape. Hmmm...still not enough for me. So I get home with my Chicago style dog, with pepperoncini, neon relish, celery salt, tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries. Ate it in 90 seconds. Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom. You get the picture. Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored.

"Oh Johnnie's you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my ....weenie?" OK so it doesn't rhyme, but Mr. Chang, owner of Johnnie's is a force to be reckoned with. He smiles. He greets. Takes your order. Makes the food. And is obviously passionate about what he does. He even has homemade chocolate cake for less than $2 a slice! But it's about the Chicago dog for me. Neon green relish. Pickle. Tomato. Celery salt. Mustard. Onions. On a steamed poppy seed bun...which I'm sure will cause me to test poz for opiates. For less than $4 you get your weenie and some delish fries! I'm so glad I went back and can't wait to have a Chicago dog made by an Asian man in the desert!

Not the cheapest, but perhaps the best. By the time I was hooked on this place, I saw on the back of their business cards, something like "Jesus prefers lightly starched" or something religious. Which, for me, I have to say is a turn off. Just like the bottom of the soda cups at In N Out. However, that said, I have an open mind and enjoy the professional, friendly and family owned Bell Cleaners. They do everything right. One time they found a few bucks in a pocket and it was in a sealed envelope when I picked up my dry cleaning. I've had rugs and even outdoor patio curtains cleaned here. Parking is readily available. Religious beliefs or non beliefs aside, this is about yelping for the good guys. And Bell Cleaners fit the bill. Oh, yea, and of course I'll still be going to In N out....I'm hooked man, like totally chasing the fast food dragon, hooked!

DC Ranch. Wow. What a spread. And this is not the place where they make the ranch dressing. That, my friends, is Hidden Valley. Here at DC Ranch north of the 101 up Pima and just off Thompson Peak, is a unique collection of upscale shops and restaurants (included are a veterinary clinic and dry cleaner). The architecture is first rate mixing the use of concrete, glass, stone and metal creating a Main Street (known as Market Street) for the high end, waspy, upscale desert inhabitants. I lived here for a year or so and loved it. It is soooo far from the rest of civilazation, god forbid you want a bean burrito at 1a.m.,  cuz guess what??? u ain't gonna find it! Although the folks who fill, wander and shop the streets of DCRanch are seemingly wealthy, white, conservative folks, a sort of small town folksiness seeped in and made me happy.

Ok, so there's Joann Fabrics and then there's Joann Craft SUPERSTORE! It certainly dwarfs the skanky Joann's on Indian School. Rickie's a fashion designer and loves fabric shopping. Much like I love grocery shopping cuz I love to cook.  "Thomas, do you want to go fabric shopping?" "Oh, gee, um there, honey pie, I was going to stay home and detail my computer keyboard. But it sounds fun. Thanks." "Thomas, there's a sale at SAS fabrics, can you believe it?" "Wow as fun as that sounds, can you believe the lime deposit build up on our balcony railing?"   Well you get the picture.  HOWEVER, this Joann rocks...sure you find thousands of fabrics, but oh so much more to behold. Lots of crafty scrapbooky, make your own patio tile type things. They have patio furniture, which I happen to be looking to purchase. Didn't find anything I liked, but was impressed they had some. The place is HUGE, super clean and most staff are very helpful.  There was an entire area of soaps, candles, etc., all marked down from $9.99 to $2.79. I grabbed a few green tea candles and threw them in the cart. They rang up at $9.99 each and when I pointed that out to the smileless and oh so charming cashier, my goodness, was she ever stymied as to what to do. We met up with a manager type at said sale area and sure enough, everything, BUT the candles on this massive sale rack, were on sale. Of course, with a little midwest charm, batting of my baby blues and a small bitch fit, we scored the candles at the sale price, thank you very much!

Well, what did we expect. After all, we are in an airport. But wait, now days airports are offering some pretty tastey food. Not in Terminal 3. Not at Sky Harbor. Not on this day. I'd say maybe we picked the wrong things, but as I looked around, not only did things not look so appealing, the guests were definitely not members of the clean plate club. My turkey club came with a lemon garlic mayo (yuck I say) and was served on a thick ass hoagie roll with 2 thin pieces of microwaved bacon, 2 thin pieces of processed turkey (think Lunchables) and a disc of american cheese. More bun than stuff easily. Rickie ordered the Philly Cheese and we quickly renamed it the Silly Cheese. Again, way more bread than the good stuff. The fries were so so but the pickle, well thank God for that pickle, cuz it sustained me through the first screaming child on our flight (see review below...if you're brave enough). I settled for 1800 as they didn't have Patron. Rickie settled for a Dos XX as they didn't have any vanilla vodka nor Franjelico (some of the fixins you need for his fave drink - updide down pineapple!). Our server, a bit stand offish at first quickly warmed up to us as she realized we were fun gay guys at the beginning of a trip with vacation money burning a whole in our Diesel jeans. A couple of rounds later we were singing a medly of American Bandstand hits and heading out the door for our flight. Buzzed but still hungry.

Tuesday. Half off wines. Not too crowded. Not too many botoxy, steroidy, siliconey people.  Weekends. Full priced wines. Crowded. Wall to wall to botoxy, steroidy, siliconey people.  Go on Tuesday. Oh, and have the cheese plate. Get cozy on a sofa. Or take in the night lights of Market Street on the patio. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.   Just don't stare too long at the cougars, cuz they will scratch your eyes out. I know. Just ask my friend Patch.

It opens at 10 am, I got there at 10:10 am and was gone by 11 am. The place was PACKED just 10 minutes after opening. It felt kinda like the DMV only with carpeting and a big TV to watch. At first I felt real impatient and thought I should leave as they only had one person working and the first customer was taking forever. I was number 64 and we were at number 50. If only I had brought my knitting. If only I had knitting stuff. Ahhh...the TV, Jags vs. Dolphins....could care less, but athletic men in tight uniforms is a sweet deterrent from perusing the stoic and impatient faces that filled the room. Soon another employee arrived and another and so on. Like that shampoo commerical from the 80s. "Number 64"....oooo that was moi. My bill paying was handled by Odin quickly, politely and professionally as was my purchase of my HD/DVR box. . All said and done I'd rather be at Cox than the DMV any ole day!

Have you ever had the Lean Cuisine chicken enchiladas? Have you ever been to a super obnoxious sorority party, where all the blonde bimbos are tanked and dancing on tables and such? Have you ever been totally ignored by wait and bar staff even though you've doused yourself in lighter fluid and set yourself on fire? Well. Then. You've been to San Felipe's. Lower than mediocore food. Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus 2 stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out. Hmmm...other than grabbing a quick beer here I'd sooner stay at home, eat Doritos and watch a sorority slasher film. What do Kristin and Pierre say? Meh? Yea, that's it. Meh!

I love this edifice so much I want to marry it. But since marrying buildings has not been approved by the voters of Arizona, along with same sex marriage and the marrying of goats, I shall perhaps just have to have a party here. WOW! What a venue. The ECHO magazine awards were held here and they couldn't have picked a better space. The textures, shapes and colors are stimulating and soothing. Much like that chilled double shot of Patron they served me. Great sight lines, audio and comfy seats all added up to a win win situation. Oh. And the fact that we won that night was even better. The views of Tempe Lake and the infinity pool were amazing. From the outside, I have to admit, it looked a bit like a Evangelical church. But once inside, full of drag queens and Grey Goose schwilling mos, I knew this was not that kind of church. In fact, no church at all. Tempe Center for the Arts is its own art. Sexy. Chic. And urban. I think that party I'll have will be a yelp event and y'all are invited.

OK so the bf is a few years younger than I. Just a tad. OK. So, he's 17 years younger. Oh my god! I'm like, a gay male cougar. I'm a manther! Anyway. I digress. A bunch of his same aged buddies wanted to meet at Kobalt. Rickie and I arrived first and discovered a bright, well kept, no dartboards kinda bar. No smell of stale beer. No problem finding a parking spot. It was actually. Civilized. And it's a gay bar in Phoenix? Wow! After having a few rounds of drinks and perhaps forgetting that I was the elder of the group, one of them exclaims...."Yea. This place is pretty cool. Too bad there's so many guys over 40 here."  Wow. I was one of those guys. But, hey! What? just because some of the hair on my head has made its way into my ear canal and lower back. And just because I  know Harvey Milk was a slain gay rights activist and not a type of dairy beverage. I can't have a place with a piano, a granite bar and a barstaff that truly knows how to make a Gibson. Thanks Kobalt. I'm blue no longer.

All mechanics suck. They take an arm, limb and an organ. All mechanics are men. All mechanics don't educate you to prevent further visits. All mechanics are greasy, shirtless, chiseled men. OK, well, why that last sentence is hot and for no journalistic reason what so ever, I announce my mechanic...BOGI at 180 Auto as the exception to the rule. A smart, hard working, mechanic who happens to be a personable, witty business person as the GO TO gal for all your auto needs. Your car stalled at Castle Boutique at 4 am and don't want the wife to know. No prob. Bogi grabs her tools and does on location repairs. Tire blows on the 51 and u pee your pants and don't know what to do (ok, so that was me....damn....don't judge my gay ass) She may not always be available but I can't recommend her enough. Her training is with BMW....thus her closeness to my own Benjamini Manishevitz   Woishihawitzi....Support local business. Especially in the car "rackett"... I just learned how to program my stereo so i'''m no car expert. But I do know good biz and Bogi is your gal!!!

R u kidding me? Seriously? Look "Mr. I'm gonna steal another person's website, design, logo and business motto" and try and pass it off as your own. Lame. How Jr. high school of you. Are you the kinda guy who ripped  the opposing student council leader's posters down? Like Reese Witherspoon in Election? Yelpers. My fellow yelpers. Bogi of 180 Degree Auto is THE mechanic to see in all of Phoenix. In addition to being ethical, smart and affordable she's cute as all get out, the bestest friend you could have and, yes and, has the most adorable parents. Well, next to mine anyway. Car broke? See Bogi? Not the most recent impersonator. Pahleeze.

When Rickie mentioned going to the Thai Hut, I thought, that's funny, I'm really not in the market for neckwear. Then we drove by and it looked so cute. Like a Thai diner with lots of booths lining the windows which overlook McDowell around 3rd Ave. Obviously not a lot of money or design when into the reincarnation, but the energy of the room and the super friendly staff warmed me instantly. I swear the server telepathically took our app order as the spring rolls arrived to the table, hot and crispy, before I had even squeezed the lemon in my water. Along with the chicken satay, they were both good, not out of this world however. Rickie's "chicken noodle" soup was flavorful, yet the chicken was hella funky. Oddly shaped bland, poached peices of poultry particularly unpleasant. The sizzling beef was Thairiffic. Really. Thairiffic. My obligatory phad thai, although missing the tofu, was very dee lish. Prices were affordable. No beer however and that made me sad. I mean I was just costume shopping at Easley's and really could have used a large Thai cerveza. Rickie loved his Thai iced tea (me? not a fan of that beverage...sort of tastes like lawn clippings and cream). The service is outstanding...attentive, friendly and efficient. That pushes them from 3 to 4 stars easily. Great energy, good food, smiling staff. I'll be back.

I HEART THE 51 Freeway. Mind you I'm not a regular freeway user as my abode and my job are a few blocks apart. So it's somewhat of a novelty and not a daunting task. However today I had to get to N. Scottsdale and I hopped on the 51, top down on the Spyder, temps in the 70s, piercing blue sky above with whimsical whispy clouds, my fave 70s CD blaring and I even parted my hair down the middle and feathered it. Truly a tribute to all things 70s. As you head north on the 51 you are embraced by the mountains on both sides. Light traffic and a kinda heavy foot, put me in NoScot in no time. When I headed home, going south on the 51 as you crest the freeway at Northern Ave. I get one of my favorite urban views ever! A perfectly framed skyline from the Central corridor to downtown. Palm trees, church steeples and high priced homes dotting the landscape. But, it's the perfect weather and warm yet crisp wind blowing through my hair that made me smile from ear to ear. Now it's not quite the same exhiliration as the PCH from Malibu to Carmel...but then again, I don't live in Malibu do I? But it's really not a bad way to just be by yourself and appreciate our urban landsape and it's sometimes harmonious blend with mother nature.

Five star venue. Reminds me of big city digs in L.A. or NYC. The runway. Oh, I so wanted to strut my butt. But I decided to nibble on the delicious appetizers like corn cakes with avocado salsa and the yummy mini croque monseurs. The Strawberry martini, although a bit too minty, was fruity and dry. Like my "funny" cousin Jim, who's 47 single, likes wicker and has an "I HEART cats and books t'shirt. Well, what do ya do? Service at our yelp event was great I thought. Kristy had quite a few folks to sling drinks at and she was polite and professional. The menu seemed slightly inventive, with a $30 lobster sandwich, a spin on a cobb salad and the now obligatory sliders. I will be back for a visit and will definitely talk it up. Next time, however, I will be ready with stilletos and my Victoria Secret angel wings!

I'm trying for a long story short. Shut up. Quit laughing. Here goes...Moved here in Feb. Loved ALL. Especially office staff. Friendly, tall people I would recall. May 2007. New owners. Good by  favoritist apt. office people I have ever encountered in my long, mulit city and illustrious rental career. Hello, weird, kinda tacky can't say anymore in case they read his kinda people. Things, well, they kinda went downhill with maintainence, etc. And, unfortunately the new tennants they brought in. I mean really, does anybody still drink Mickey's Big Mouth and smoke clove cigarettes's? Honestly! But I held out, cuz I'm an optimist and things took a turn for the best when I arrived home tonight to find the following sign posted on our gate: Jack O Lantern contest extended. Ends tomorrow at 6 pm. 1st prize $200 rent credit. 2nd prize $150 rent credit. 3rd prize $100 rent credit. KICK ASS on that! Where's my pumpkin, knife and stencil...

Clarendon Park Apartments...SUCK IT!   Charging me $30 to clean my tub (pahleeze, I make Felix Unger look like a slob!), $25 for a broken towel rack (which had been wobblly since day one and repaired several times) and a carpet cleaning charge on carpet that is 8 years old AND I know you replaced it after I moved out.  SUCK IT!  You'll NEVER get that money from me.   Not funny people, but hopefully useful and I tried, oh I tried to be cool.

When you think of Scottsdale lodging you think W Hotel, Valley Ho, Royal Palms, Motel 6. What? Motel 6 you say? Yep. You betcha! We needed a room close to Devil's Martini before and after our VMarie event Saturday. We would not be spending much time in our room nor would we enjoy any luxurious amenities, as we would be spending most of our time at the event. I passed by this Motel 6 when I first moved here and was struck by it's neat, retro charm. So when NTUIT booked a room at this motel, we were totally on board. The rooms are tiny! Reminded me of a dorm room. And that's not a bad thing as I actually lived in a pretty swanky dorm. This room was spotless and had of all things, new wood floors. A first for me in any motel/hotel/resort. Never one to use ANY hotel comforter, I brought my own bankie! (Yes that's baby talk for blanket...I call it my bankie...don't judge!)...however, I was struck by the newness of these comforters. And yes, they were hideously ugly in every way. We paid $50 for our little staycation room, enjoyed a nice shower and the pool the next day. We parked right in front of our door and brought along our little Emilie as pets are allowed. I can still hear the clickity clack of her nails on the wooden floors. Located in the shadows of Fashion Square and blocks from Oldtown Scottsdale, I would most definitely recommend this to visitors looking for modest digs. Or for fashion designers, performers and emcees needing a close place to crash after a magical evening of fashion and music down the street.

More vinyl than Dita von Teese's closet. If you can imagine. Man, they really cram the LP's into every nook and cranny. I took my friends' here as they are huge music buffs, especially alternative stuff. Me? Pretty mainstream and very 80s...think Cyndi Lauper, Talking Heads and Madonna. But they found some They Must Be Giants and other obscure bands mama never heard of. Two things struck me as interesting here:  1) When Rickie asked the clerk if she could suggest any music they may have he could use for a runway show, she quickly and without thought, said, "I have NO idea." Alrighty then slacker!   2) I saw two packages of pencils, for sale, hanging on the wall. When I asked her why they sold pencils she quickly and without thought, said, "Well, cuz we're an art supply store you know?" Nope. Didn't know that slacker. Sorry to disturb your vertical nap.  But for all you music lovers, looking for some oldies but goodies, I would imagine this is a very cool place to get your vinyl swag.   And if you do go, give lil Miss Sunshine a hug for me.

This year, PFW, was held in Tempe. Yes, Tempe. With after parties in Scottsdale. Yes, Scottsdale. Talk about an identity crisis. It's like that scene with Faye Dunaway in Network. "Your mother! Your daughter! Your sister!"  The venue was fantastic. A hollowed out space in an office complex on Rio Salado. The runway, naturally, cut through the middle of the room with vendor tables off to one side. The vendor tables were a sad site. Seriously. They looked no better than my lemonade stand I had in the summer of '77. In fact, if I do say so myself, what I did with a card table, cardboard sign and my mom's best table cloth, was sheer genius. Though mom wasn't too pleased to see her lace table cloth covered in lemonade. Good thing I was cute. A wall of gorgeous windows allowed light and a view of the fountain. Nice.   The only food offered was cupcakes from Sprinkles. So I finally tasted these trendy treats. While I enjoyed it, seriously, it didn't curl my toes and send my eyes to the back of my head. It was a freakin' cupcake. The VIP bar was serving up some yummy pomegranate vodka concotions! Dee lish!  The event lacks leadership. No emcee. No host. Just a wandering trumpet player. Yes. That was the entertainment between designers. Fortunately I entertained myself by playing the squishy head game with people across the room.   That said. I had a blast. And seeing my man's designs come to life on the models, set to the music he worked so hard on, was nothing short of magical.

OK. This is it people. This is why we are here. Right? This is the time of year we phone relatives back home, donned in flip flops, board shorts and Ray Bans. We say things like, "Ohhhh, I forgot it's 32 degrees, snowing, sleeting and you have dark dismal clouds looming overhead." "I'm by the pool flipping burgers in my new swim suit I got at Marshall's" (ok, I wouldn't reveal that, I would say Saks 5th Ave., but work with me people!). Even though we're still "struggling" with these unseasonal temps (a la upper 80s's), our relatives, friends and family we left behind are snuckering down (did I say snuckering?) in their moon boots and parkas. Us? We? We're still chillin' in our favorite T's, shorts and sandals. The point for this review? Hmmmm. to review us. To review the weather. And the jab at the rest of the good ole US of A. I know Phoenix is waiting for a heartbeat. I know there are newbies who don't get us yet. And that's ok.  I feel the energy of the desert. I feel the energy of a new city emerging from the ashes. I feel the uncomfortableness from this nasty ass IKEA chair on my butt. While I know it's time to sign off and find comfort elsewhere, I just had to say....I LOVE Phoenix and if you don't, go somewhere else, drop the negativity and find your mojo within yourself!

Don't go Winter. Please. Pretty please. I mean I know you have to go eventually. To make way for your evil twin. Summer. That bitch. I'm just asking if you can linger until July 4th. Then I'll be ready for three digit temps, scorching sun rays and melting steering wheels. I just want to party with your 70 degree self a wee bit longer. Thanks for listening Winter. You've been good to me so far...

AM PM...you thought stood for, I don't know, maybe morning and night. No. AM PM...stands for... Aimless Psychotic Maniacal Men. Yes I said it. I'm a city snob. I left the white, pristine silicone sands of North Scottsdale for the oh so diverse and gritty crowd of our up and coming downtown Phoenix.  I did. Shoot me. This mini market location is in the Hall O Freakin' Fame of jacked up mini marts across the country. We've all been there. Have you been to this one?  Holy crap. Aside from the $.45 ATM charge for buying their goods (which sucks ass) is this... "Hey, Mister, I lost my bus pass and need money to get to my violin lesson." "Don't park so close to my Monte Carlo fag." And my favorite "Me and her are lost. We're s'posed to be at, um, Injun School and Center Avenue to meet my dude..."  I'll spare you the rest.  Inside, the goods are limited, the chocolate bars melted and yes, I'm gonna say it, the folks running those registers can be, shall I say, AROMATIC. Good Night.

What a fabulous venue for yet another fabulous yelp event. From the valet to the restrooms. From the vast modern space to impressive and friendly service.  And the food! Oy Ve (that's Japanese for yummy)... Ika Furai Age Watari Gani Abura Bouzo No Tataki Shiro Asparagus Zoe Butaniku To Hotate No Gyoza Yakitori-Negima Yaki  OK. Admit it. You know asparagus. But what about the rest? Well, you'll have to check out Roka Akor to find out. Cuz I'm not spilling it. My fave was the Abura Bouzo. Buttah! Like a big stick of buttah! I could have chowed down several more. And then several more. Light and airy with clean lines and muted tones, this is contemporary asian at its best.   Origato. Dori Ori Gato Mr. Roboto.

Whymsical. Eclectic. Modern. Even a bit Victorian. D. Frank packs a wallop of a punch for any shopping addict. Nestled along fantastic Stetson Dr. in Oldtown Scottsdale, this beautfiul two-room furniture and art boutique is the perfect holiday shopping stop. This award winning designer has such a flair for upscale style. Yet I find the store and it's wares to be very approachable. From the $1,200 Swarvoski crystal floor lamp (to die for...I would most definitely give a limb or organ for it) to a delicate butterfly tray priced at $22. There are sofas, dining room furniture, occasional chairs, day beds and lots of gorgeous art. Not to be missed are the candles, collectible boxes and stationery. Oldtown is decked out for the holidays and has never looked better. Especially along this stretch as most of the new buildings and waterfront action is up and aglow. Thank you D. Frank Designs. You have finally put me in the Christmas spirit!

This place rocks my chain Mary. I would totally give it five stars but I'm forced to go to Arizona Mills. Forced to navigate the mullet filled, stroller strewn and too many freakin' families, halls of this outlet mall. Some people go for java when they shop here. As seen by the sick ass long lines at Starbucks and that Gloria's place. Me? A cocktail or two at The Rainforest (cuz the food there is SO bad) takes the edge off. NOW...my reason for the review...Dolce and Gabanna pants...so sick...so hot. Marked down from $485 to $179. And they fit! It was a pure Carrie Bradshaw/Milona Blanik moment I had in the fitting room. I've accrued other great deals, including a special edition German Puma t-shirt that was $120 and I nabbed for $15. I mean really. $120 for a t-shirt. Honestly. Underwear maybe. But a t-shirt. Oh, best part. I use my Neiman's card and get a 5% discount. Shop on yelpers. Shop on. See ya at the mall....please, leave the strollers at home!!! Oh and I hear a little finger tip of Crown Royal under a toddler's tongue puts them right out. I'm just sayin....

Pistol Pete you sure are a pistol. Like the promos on the radio, where they have recorded listeners piping in their enthusiasm for 92.7, "I AM ENERGY!!!!" And yes, I AM ENERGY TOO! Even in my fourth decade I love techno and dance music. Ann Murray and Sade can only do so much for ya. But remixes of Pet Shop Boys, current hits by Rhianna and other house music is what I listen to. And Mr. Pete himself. A delight. I know there are other DJ's, but I've met Pistol Pete at various functions and he really is totally energetic. And a charmer. Only complaint is the semi bad reception. Wassup with that? So, if the Coyote station has you asleep. Or classic rock is just too much. And hip hop is well, it's hip hop. Tune in to 92.7 and jam and dance in your car. Until you get that weird stare from the grandma in the Impala..."Hey, you're driving an Impala".

What? Squeeze me? Are you serious? More hip hop? No 80s dance music. I'm going to crawl into a cave with my Depeche Mode t shirt, my glow sticks and poppers. It's just not fair damnit! Pistol Pete? You lil pistol. I better hear that raspy Richard Simmons voice sometime soon. Or. Or. Or I'll start listening to some heinous classic rock while wearing acid washed jeans and moccasins.

Hmmm....DMV. Hospital waiting room. The line at Pizzeria Bianco. Scottsdale Courthouse. All of these are places you will wait. And wait. And wait.   No magazines. No food or beverages allowed. And for God's sakes. Don't crack a smile.  At least they pipe in ABBA and The Beach Boys to help pass the 2 1/2 hours. This was weeks ago and I'm still humming Surfin USA and Dancing Queen.   Can I sue for this?

Stevey P:" Shopping for a jock strap in a former Albertson's seemed weird...:  I do not. Know. How. To top. That.   Those who know me, however, do not see me as a top anyway, so I will move on...  We walked into this mammoth sports store with two things in mind; water shoes for Rickie and new tennies for me. Although the store was full of merchandise, the signage was clear and viseable. BOOM. Men's shoes to the right.  Grabbed Rickie's shoes. Found a pair of $69.99 Asics marked down to $39.99. Tried 'em on. Little slivers of pillow heaven. My toes for the first time spoke to me and said, "Thank you. Thank you, you cheap fool. What took you so long?" Kinda bitchy, but I understood.   We were asked for help, though never needed it. Arrived at cashier and was asked if we found everything we needed. Yes. Was the answer. There less than 10 minutes.  In N Out. Fast food. Fast shoes. Great service.   BTW Stevey P...I hear Unique On Central has some rhinestone jock straps...just an FYI.

When I was little and my parents would take me to a furniture store, I would ditch them, find a living room arrangement I fancied, and play house. Yea. You heard me. I would pretend I was Samantha from Bewitched. Sitting in my Queen Ann chair, waiting for Darren to come home from Tate Advertising, so I could smother him with my bewitching kisses. Then I would twitch my nose, move to the bedroom area, and well, the rest is a little PG 13 so I'll leave it up to your imagination. This Crate and Barrel, indeed, has a fabulous furniture selection. I love it more than Pottery Barn (too shabby chic), Restoration Hardware (more hardware than furniture) and more than Z Gallery (too much purple crap and Melrose meets a brothel type stuff). Not to mention all the other goodies from dishes to pillows to glassware. Crate and Barrel strikes the perfect balance between contemporary stying, fair prices and quality. So, if you ever see me, talking to myself, while lounging on a chaise here, you'll know what's up.

Maybe I saw too much of you Z, back in your 80s heyday in LA. You know, you were all the rage, with your first store right there on trendy Melrose Ave. You were more popular than the shoulder pad maker for Designing Women. Or maybe the set designers on Melrose Place went a little too crazy in Amanda's apartment cuz it looked like you threw up all over apartment 12. For a while that mid century modern meets Victorian was oh so en vogue. Purple velvet framed mirrors. Golden sun wall decorations. And silver laminate dining room tables with mismatched chairs. Now, sadly. Your just a bit dated. More so than Scott Baio at a bimbos convention. All the best Z. Yours truly, T.

Ahhh...the lingering country club lunches at Phil's Grill. Those were the days. When I lived in the white, homogenized and frankly, boring, world called DCRanch, I often met up with my roomie at Phil's. Sort of the anti Zipp's sports bar. Of course there are the obligatory plasma tvs. The views of the course are great as you nestle into a comfie sofa . I felt like the old farts in the movie Trading Places. We'd sit in those big leather chairs by the fireplace and count our money. Once, I counted $27 in one pocket alone! The food here is fantastic, as it should be for a mogul like myself. Favorites include the Sonoran chicken pasta with fresh grilled corn, the prime rib slider (how old  money is that?!) and the Southwestern wrap. The menu does include high end steaks running up to $37 or so. I would have ordered that. But was unable to find another $10 in my other pockets.

I would rather be a human pinata... I would rather watch Cloverfield again....ugh... I would rather be the guy who has to clean busstop areas....  ...than ever, ever see a movie here. I've left shoes behind the floors are so sticky. Wads of gum EVERYWHERE. And it's like Chuck E Cheese decided to open a movie theater. Crying. Screaming. Kicking. And that's me trying to shut the little snot nosed brats up!   Seriously. Stay at home. Watch the best of David Caruso. Or watch Pamela Anderson on Celebrity Jeopardy. Watch the grass grow. Watch water boil. Just don't watch a movie here. You'll thank me!

No, this is not a DVD where Webers and Hibachis lift their lids and show you their hot coals. This is indeed a family friendly business. And when I needed some patio heaters fixed, it was BBQ Grills Gone Wild to the rescue. Thanks to Curtis for warming up my patio and making my guests cozy again. And what a great name. Much better than BBQ N Things. Or BBQ Heaters and Beyond. Or BBQ World. Or BBQs R Us. Or Pier 1 BBQ. Or BBQKEA. Well...you get the idea. Grill on yelpers. Grill on!

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them.   Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly.   Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards.   Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing.   All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.

Being gay has become so serious lately. Case in point. There were at least 5 different banks at the festival this year. More than 2 teeth whitening booths. And a plethora of "sign up for this study and we'll tell you if you're normal" booths.   Hey! What happened to Speedos, go go boots, poppers and nipple clamps?  For God sakes I can get the other stuff at a  midwest family reunion.   That said, I did have a banging good time. Threw back a few Stellas for a paltry $5 a piece. Not bad by festival/fair/concert standards. Crowd was a bit thin Sunday, not in weight, just in numbers. But we had a festive time, bought some CD's, DVDs and a polish sausage that was way bigger than the bun. Hmmm... Plenty of families with kids to balance the debouchery of my group made for a fun day. And thanks Steve for the ride home on your bike. How you hauled four drunk dudes home I'll never know. Cheers! And rainbows to all...I'll get back to ya next year!

This year. I went to  Pride. With my mom. My 74 year old, deliciously and overwhelmingly, unconditionally loving mom! Easily one of my favorite days I've ever spent with this saintly human. She was accompanied by her 60ish year old female cousin. Yep. They played lesbians! They thought they were the shit. And they were. While no tonguing occurred (thankfully, that would have been scarring), they did hold hands at one point and giggled.   I've attended LA, SF, Long Beach, San Diego and NYC Prides. I have a soft spot for our little desert Mayberry Pride. I wish the walk from 3rd Ave and Indian School to the main gate wasn't such a hike. I was exhausted by the time I reached the front gate. But a perfect reason to run straight (ha ha, I said straight) to the beer stand.   Beer was cold. Brats were hot. Bears were hairy. Twinks were rail ass thin. Lesbians in Wranglers. Port a potties were CLEAN but SO FREAKIN' HOT!   Second best part next to being with mom and my man....NTUIT's performance. If you haven't seen this dynamo duo, you MUST get their CD! I am biased as I love them both. Oh. And I have a cameo on their last track, Celebrity Life...  Pride. Proud. Budding recording artist. And yep Gay as ever!

I had an "herb box" in college I remember. Kept it under my bed. Or in the back of the closet. Or in a shoe. Gee, that was some herb I can't even remember...  This Herb Box however, I shan't ever forget!!!  Butternut Squash Enchiladas. White Bean Chicken Chili. Crab Cilantro Dip. The Zucchini soup of the day...ALL...outstanding!!!  Now that I've moved back to DC Ranch I'm so glad to see the Herb Box and even more excited that this is my new "Cheers". Sorry Gallo Blanco, though I miss you madly...I've found another relationship. And no it's not complicated!  Quite simple in fact. Delicious, fresh ingredients. Delightful, warm staff and a cozy and bright spot on Market Street.  I've been here with family. With friends. And even a date. Herb Box, if I stick around AZ long enough, I just may ask you to marry me!  So step outside of your "box" and head to The Herb Box. But call me first and I will meet you there!!!

Me, my bestie friend Deb and my thoughtful and wonderful Santa Barbara cousin, (yes, she drove AWAY from pristine SB, CA to the sweltering heat of AZ to HELP her lil cuz move...COUSIN OF THE YEAR AWARD GOES TO...)...Lee Anne were packing up my 2BD, 2BA CenPho bachelor pad when Camelback Moving came a knockin'...

How about G Spot baby!? These little ice cream sammies, are not so little actually, and have always hit my G Spot! Get your mind outta the gutter my yelpitas! By G Spot, I mean Goodie Oh So Goodie Spot. And ice cream always hits that spot. The cookies are first rate and the ice cream, while no Marble Slab or Cold Stream Creamery, makes those packaged Nestle Tollhouse numbers at the QT quiver in dairy shame! I've been here a few times an hour or so before closing and they're already swabbing the deck and having the "we're closing in 50 minutes vibe, so go to Safeway and get some Ben and Jerry's"...hate that! And hope my staff doesn't give off that aura. Tonight I had a ZPizza delivered WITH Pink Spot yummies and Mr. Gonzales and I are very happy. And full. So four stars to ice cream sammies DELIVERED in Phoenix. Come on, how cool is that?

As one of my fave English bands, ABC says, "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"...hurts...but in a good way. Like a naughty spanking. Not a big toe contusion hurt. First off, this place smelled delightful, like vanilla and lavender with a little Nag Champa thrown in...no weird old Auntie's closet smell here! We were greeted by a young Carol Burnett look alike which is awesome! Especially since Carol Burnett grew up in Hollywood and went to Hollywood High School.  But the flow of the store and the quality of their wares is top drawer!   Overall, very well organized. Good flow. Did I mention it smells good? Amazing selection of purses. No, I'm not looking to buy a purse. I'm a he man after all. I just thought some were so cute I wanted to squeeze them. Um. Anyway. The mens section is not bad, lots of XL and not so much small  though...wondering who sold them these clothes? Big, brawny bowlers? Not sure.  And for you nun collectors, you can't miss out on an entire area of nun bric a brac! Very fun! Like book stores, card shops and Hello Kitty Conventions, I could spend hours in here!   Hollywood was my home for many years. Great to have some of the glam and glitz here in Phoenix!

I laugh at the DaVinci Code. They have nothing. Nothing I say. On me. I have decoded TJ Maxx. Yes shoppers, if you look closely at the T and the J....you can clearly see they stand for Thanks Jesus. Yes. Thanks Jesus. TJ. Oh the Maxx part? Well Thanks Jesus 2 the Maxx! Duh! My fave of the Ross Dress for Less Fortunate type stores. TJ Maxx! Say it aloud, it's quite spiritual. TJ Maxx has some good stuff. I say amen! I say charge it! The mens' clothing section is pretty boring, run of the mill crap from the Greg Norman collection. Occasionally you can score some hottie 2xist undies. But the real gospel. Is found in housewares. TONS of great stuff from vases, sculptures, wine glasses, Calphalon, little boxes you have no use for but they're so darn cute you just have to buy them and find space on some random shelf or dresser at home....TJ...Thanks Jesus. Now, big guy, if you could just do something with my debt....

Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio.   We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!  While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy.   We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!  Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable!   And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott.   OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!

Wow. Fail. Really. You just blew it.  I wasn't so concerned or rallied up about the organic aspect as I had my doubts to it's legitimacy. It was the pick up and drop off delivery service that made me get out the gay spray.   Really. This potential customer, who recently lost a whole bunch of pounds and has a whooooole new wardrobe, is keeping his dry cleaning business at Society Cleaners on Camelback. Shout out...hey...arms in the air...  I called in and inquired about the delivery service. The employee took my address and times that would work for me for dropping off my dry cleaning bags. She also told me she wasn't sure about their schedule as the driver is in college and has different class times.   What? Like I give a rat's ass if the driver is in college or in Depends. Don't. Care. But I was excited for this new luxury.   Thursday comes. Three o'clock to five o'clock. Six. Six thirty. No show. Fail. I didn't bother calling back.   Nor should you.

VIP. Hmm. It must stand for Very Icky PooPoo. Yep. That's what it means. I mean really, how cliche, a stinky, stinky, cab. What is this? New York? Thank God all the windows were down, because this was some serious BO. All the Right Guard in the world would not have helped this man. I'm thinking, perhaps, a good ole Silkwood shower may do the trick.   So. Stinky cab arrives driving like a bat out of hell. I thought we were going to be run down like those folks at the Farmer's Market in Santa Monica. But we jumped in, breathed through our mouths and prayed for a non fatal journey.   So Stinky. That's my nickname for him, drove like a drunken Helen Keller on a mission to hit every possible pothole from Kobalt to The Clarendon.  I would say one star. But, hey, we did indeed arrive alive. And now I have this not so positive yet colorful review to enjoy. So. Two stars.   "Thank you for calling Very Icky PooPoo Taxi. How may I help you..."

I MUST UPDATE! Someone, clearly has stepped in and revamped VIP Taxi and it now lives up to it's name Very Important Person. The past few months I've used VIP several times, from the dispatcher, to the friendly drivers and clean cars, I now only have VIP in my cell phone. Well. I did have it in my cell phone. Til it broke. But make no mistake people, VIP Taxi will be speed dial number 2 on my new phone! Gotta put mom and dad first, right? Rock on VIP!

Ok. So I've never actually been to Two Hippies BHOTAB...but I'm going to review it anyway. JUST KIDDING! I've had take out but someone else has always picked it up for me. You know. I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?

OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms.   Now that's a pretty picture for ya!  House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll.   Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!  DD! Fyi...I will return to you asap!

"Excuse me waiter. What's this fly doing in my soup?"  "It appears to be doing the backstroke sir."   Yep. This pretty much sums up our service at MB this past Sunday. Forgotten entrees. No ice bucket for the champagne. Drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. Ketchup? Our beniets? Ugh!   Formerly the FoodBar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), MB is a lovely French restaurant in the heart of Oldtown. We sat inside, luckily, as some Gen X Jewel type performer was on the patio "singing" and strumming her guitar. I heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. Fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out!   The food was quite good. Not incredible. Beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. My eggs Benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of English muffins. But no potatoes. No salad. No nothing on the side. Not even a garnish. Others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all American breakfast.   Christine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. Too bad much of our energy was used to flag down ANYONE who could help us. I swear I almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill Rickie's coffee. God that would have been fun!   So I can't say oui oui to MB quite yet. And for now I shall just say ta ta!

Sens is, well, SENSational!  I love tapas style of eating. And unlike yogurt and cupcakes, tapas, I think, is here to stay! Sharing food with friends is perhaps one of my all time favorite things to do. Some people like camping. Some people like How I Met My Mother. Others scrap booking. My gig? Friends. Food. Sharing.   So we gathered here yesterday after enjoying fantastic cocktails and my favorite nachos at Bliss to have some serious food. I shared my two favorite things here, the SOUP DUMPLINGS...omg...omg...pounding fists on table...total mouthgasm. You know when you get the squirt of gooey cheese from the middle of pasta shell in your fave mac n cheese? This is so similar. Hot, salty broth exploding as you bite into tender pork and savory cabbage. Pure heaven! Really, who doesn't like things exploding in your mouth?   My other love is the White Ginger fish, whitefish steamed with a soy ginger sauce. And I loves me some ginger. Even on Gilligan's Island, I was a Ginger man, not a Mary Ann. I mean really, pigtails?! Tender, mild and absolutely off the charts with some very enjoyable flavors.  Miss for me on this visit were the Korean short ribs...ugh...flavor was there...just couldn't chew the damn things. Also on the dry side and simply just very pedestrian was the Wasabi Soy Chicken.  But, with the fabulous company I had and the Asahi beer and the chilled sake, it still measured up to a four star evening. Service was great as well. Patient, good-natured waiter, took care of eight buzzed and chatty diners!  So Sens...you get me. With your tapas style menu. Your downtown vibe. Chilled sake.  And. The. Soup. Dumplings.   SENSational indeed!

Well Hanny's. Since that first, really, rather awkward first date we had, I'm pleased to say that you have won my heart.   I've been back many times since and have some delicious and playful culinary delights to please my Culinary Comedian palate.  From the bruschetta to your steak and your awesome Manhattan's...you most deservedly earn at least one extra star.   Loving the banquettes with the backs that ever so slightly recline. Think airplane seat recline. But with more leg room. And better food.   Though I must say, the restrooms on an airplane, though small, are more convenient than yours. What is it? The fifth floor? Sixth? I forget.  Loving you Hanny's. Dare I say we are actually dating now? The real deal?   Next time I see you let's hug and I'll give you a little slap on the ass!

A $19 cobb salad with a $3 PBR. Well, let's be real here...eventually we learned of buckets of PBR, six for $15. DEAL! SOLD! The cocktail list is lively, fresh and inventive and pricey as one would expect at a resort.   We took shelter in our private cabana and had stellar service from AJ. We were served a fruit and veggie platter along with other things we ordered...nachos were delicious...as was my cobb salad.  The cabana was comfortable with a u shaped seating area with complimentary bottled water (well, complimentary my ass...it's part of the $200 that was paid for the cabana...but I digress) and of course plenty of clean, fresh towels.   The entrance, the grounds, the main pool...everything just so vibrant, clean and utterly breathtaking. The crowd was so NOT douchey. It was a nice mix of old and young, gay and straight and black and white...you get the picture. We met a lot of fun people during our six hours there.   Now. The best part. My friends, young as they are, were staying for happy hour. Well I had my limit of PBR's and had a Schnauzer in diapers waiting for her afternoon walk, so I decided to split. The concierge directed me to the bellman and said he would help me get a taxi. The bellman asked if a towncar would be ok? Um. Hmm. A pristine, shiny black town car or a roll of the dice with a skanked out taxi with a sweaty, hairy, stinky driver. Yes. Town car.   It. Was. Perfect. I was sunburnt. Tipsy. And on my way home. The drive down the 51 is so beautiful. When he pulled into my driveway and said it was $29 (a deal!)...I gave him two twenties and thanked him. Cuz that's how I roll.

Oh how easy it would be to diss the USPS. What with all the "gone postal" stories we've heard. But I have to say, not only are the little uniforms hot....I mean really... those cute little black socks many of them wear....HELLO!!!  I"ve learned many things at this particular location.  Agnes' husband Leanord cannot stand in line with her because he has horrible arthritis in his knees. So he sits while she stands. Lovely.   Agnes has bad breath. Sorry. She just did.   Fancy lady enters, while dozens of us are waiting in line, thinking of starting a game of Twister, when Fancy lady buds in front of everybody "cuz she's in a hurry". Really. Cuz we all got nothing else to do Missy.  And one nice man used to collect stamps "the old fashioned kind", until "they came out with the kind you can't lick!"...yes...he said that!  But. These folks know when to add clerks and everyone is very helpful and friendly. Perhaps they are eating healthy food and drinking Naked Juice from Fresh n Easy next door.   Licking or no licking. This location is purrrrfect for me. And even though I appreciate being asked if I want the special Star Wars stamps, I say HELL NO...I'm waiting for the Hello Kitty collection. Hello???!!!? Peace out yelpitas. You rawk my chain Mary!

Boy did I sure feel like heel when in an attempt to catch a football I clipped the front of my shoes on the curb and scraped the leather. I mean these are not just any shoes people. Let's just say if Carrie Bradshaw were a man, Carrie Bradshaw would have these puppies. I'm talking handcrafted Johnston & Murphy. Ok? I spent a week grieving unsure what to do. I ate a lot of ice cream. Watched Tori Spelling I'm a woman in peril movie marathon. And cleared several boxes of tissues.   Tony The Tiger Tony Orlando and Dawn Tony The Shoe Guy  My three favorite Tony's! Six bucks and an hour later, they were in pristine condition. My feet and my soul, once again unified. Happy. Comfortable. And, most importantly, styling.  Though I can't figure out why shoe repair shops smell like a mechanics garage. Hmmmm...anyone? Bueller? Anyone?

You buffed. You shined. You commented on my behind.   Yep. Tony. I'm upping you a star sir!  $40 to spruce up my favorite Johnston & Murphy hand made Italian shoes for my launch party was the Deal of the Century. And it took, what, a couple hours? New heels. New insoles.   Did I mention buffed and shined. Oh. Yep. I did.   Get your shoes a makeover at Tony's. Tell 'em Thomas sent you!

Emilie, our celebrity Schnauzer, gives Oliver & Annie two paws up. I know. She is adorable. Anyway, this is hands down the sweetest pet boutique. So opposite the juggernaut PetSmart. You are actually greeted with a smile and not a scowl. This place is so cozy you could seriously stand in the middle and see everything in the store. Delightful toys and the cutest puppy apparel. Well. At least until we come out with the VMarie Poochie line. You won't find mainstream dog food here, so don't expect Alpo or Purina. The owners are passionate about animals and quality goods and services. So bring your bitch to Oliver & Annie and have a doggone good time!

So we took a gamble when selecting Scramble so please forgive my Scramble ramble. Ugh. So much potential. Friendly staff. But so so food and though friendly, an untrained staff. Upon entering I like the open and airy room. I like the railing along the east wall with great views of the mountains. But. Wait. What are all these people standing in line for? The host I'm sure. WTF? It's an order at the counter sit down with a number on your table kinda place. Ugh again. Not my thing. Like camping. Or hiking. Or that second Narnia movie.   I'm with two people and they are ordering up their grub. Scanning the menu. Asking some questions. At one point my friend was ordering a blended coffee drink. The shelves behind the cashier were loaded with frape type powders. I couldn't believe I heard her say "Oh. Yeah. I don't know how to make those!" LMAO. I had grabbed some bottled Vitamin water so I was in the clear on potentially prepared beverage fiasco.   When we sat the food arrived in a timely manner. Pancakes and sausage for me. Same for my friend. My other friend had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll. My side of eggs came out quickly afterward.   I'm starving so I'm diving in to the fluffy (actually doughy) pancakes. I prefer a thinner flapjack with some slightly crispy edges. Sausages. Much like Phyllis Dillers's hoo haa..well...sadly they were dry. And I purposely ordered pork sausage cuz I wasn't in the mood for turkey.   Now. I'm noticing my friend TRYING to cut up his pancakes. I cut as I go. But he likes to get everything all chopped up apparently. Now he's a big guy. It was hysterical seeing him trying to cut through those DOUGHY pancakes. He gave up midway. Needless to say neither one of us finished our cakes.   Lastly he realized as he scanned his check that his omelette he ordered didn't come out because it wasn't even listed on the bill.   So Scramble. You got potential kid. I felt the heart in the room. Just didn't get much from the brain.

Wow. I can't believe I waited this long to check out Postino's. I mean what is wrong with me? It's like why did Liza wait so long to divorce her gay ass husband? Or why did it take so long KFC to come up with grilled chicken? Or why, why did it take so long for The Ghost Whisperer to be canceled? I ask you. Why? WHYYYY!!  Putting that aside I have to say I was UBER impressed with Postino's on every level. I triple love the bar opening up to the intimate patio, the charming, airy and open dining room with the fireplace and cozy vintage sofas. Love it.   Now let's talk BRUSCHETTA 101! OK. They have nailed it. Nailed it like Levi Johnston nailed Bristol Palin! My faves were the brie and apple and the ricotta with pistachios and dates. The bread is perfectly crunchy on the edge with a soft middle. Kind of like my Uncle Larry but don't tell him I said that.   We over ordered because we definitely didn't each need our own sandwich. The Niner (I think that's the name) was gigantic and served on delicious focaccia bread...crispy bacon, juicy chicken...so so good. Side salad was, um, interesting. While I appreciate the pine nuts and the cheese I just wasn't feeling the dressing. Kind of sour.   Not to worry. Nothing could spoil this fabulous foodie rampage. Service, at first a tad slow...was friendly and efficient.   It won't take me long to return to you Postino's. I want to be a regular so that when I walk in everyone yells THOMAS!!!

First off you must consume enough sake and beer to warrant a visit to the restroom. That way you can pass through the sexy, cold, metal chains dangling in the hallway door. Reminded me of the beads I had in my bedroom in 5th grade. Yep. Beads. Don't judge. It was the 70s you know!? And the restrooms themselves were fabulous as well. But this isn't a site on reviewing johns so let's get to the good stuff.   Immediate greeting. Quick seating. And minutes later...lots of EATING! The gyoza was orgasmic. Thin, crunchy with shrimp and veggies! The mussel appetizer was good, not great, but creamy and hot. Reminds me of Taylor Lautner...muscles, creamy...well you get the picture. We dove into the sushi; tuna, yellowtail, freshwater eel...you know, the standards. All delicious...yellowtail being the best.   The rolls, though I don't remember any names were all very good. One in particular was made with soy paper? Is that right? Soy paper? It was a nice break from the seaweed. Soy paper?   We spent about $50 a person...worth every penny. The vibe inside on a Monday night was pretty happening I must say. Sexy lighting and great tables along the window. Our server, complete with a big poofy mohawk was fantastic! Wasn't crazy about the chairs. What? Did they recycle some shopping carts?  Moira! I want moira you!

You grab some funny hats. Big sunglasses. Maybe a boa.  Cram into the SnapBooth...oh wait...I digress...  You meet up with friends at an event and have a few cocktails...ok...now back to the review...  Let the fun ensue.  The Zoolander pose.  The obligatory stick your tongue out shot. Your crazy Marty Feldman shot. The naughty I hope my mom doesn't see this photo. The Charlie's Angels finger gun pose. Three people needed.  I go to a lot of events and whenever I see SnapBooth it makes me happy.  Like "take an additional 40%" sign at Macy's. Like seeing Ryan Reynolds shirtless. Like seeing Ryan Reynolds, shirtless, with you, at Macy's. He's buying.  Happy? SnapBooth!

Yep. That's right. Mister Sparky. So close to my nickname in college; Mister Spanky! But there's no foul play with Mister Sparky. These are my go to guys for all my electrical needs. And when you call them, here's how they answer the telephone: "Thank you for calling Mister Sparky, my name is Amber, how may I light up your day?" For realz! I love that forced perkiness sometimes. When I worked at an aerobic studio in Minneapolis, like, 100 years ago...ok...I know many of you now are picturing me in my Gilda Marx Lycra onesie...and for that, I'm sorry. But I digress. We had to answer the phone in a BIG high energy voice, "Hi, it's a great day at The Firm, this is Thomas may I help youuuuuuu?" So I get the phone jive. I hope my employees are enthusiastic in their phone answering skills. Nothing worse than a Debbie Downer the first time you call a business. The Mister Sparky team is always on time, clean cut and actually just down right cute! They always leave with a coupon for your next electrical mishap, shake your hand and thank you with a big smile! My kinda biz! So the next time the "Lights Go Out in Georgia" (oh God I'm old, that is a bizarre Vickie Lawrence reference), I say don't be snarky, call Mister Sparky.   And scene....

Bacon makes everything better. I know vegetarians who long for thick, salty slab of bacon. Crumbled on salads. Nestled between smoked turkey and baby Swiss. In potato salad. Reveered pastry chef Tracy Dempsey is famous for her bacon brittle. Yep. Even in candy. Bacon! Rejoice! So, needless to say I was excited to eat at Bacon.   When we arrived I was loving the open, airy room with a bar straight ahead and lots of table options from booths to high tops. The doors were open and a lovely breeze entertained the room.   But I got that vibe. Like we just arrived after some crazy ass rush. And I was correct. We waited a bit for our server to arrive, busied ourselves with a New York Times (for me) and a March issue of W Magazine (for Rickie...go figure!). We overheard a couple at the bar mention they'd been waiting 45 minutes for their food. UGH! I was ready to gnaw on the table I was so hungry.   Well, we placed our order and received it within 15 minutes. And. It. Was delicious! Eggs Benedict (for me) and the Mr. Big (for Rickie...go figure!) did not disappoint. In lieu of Canadian bacon, I had a thick slab of ham...a little too much for the dish...but no major complaint.   Everyone from the hostess, the GM and the bartenders and servers were very friendly. Though I felt for them, as brunch is THE hardest shift in the business. I always equated brunch (at least when I lived in West Hollywood) as hungover guests being served by hungover waiters. Dicey vibe baby.   Can't wait to return to Bacon. Hoping, however, they up the OJ from a Sunny D like product to freshly squeezed.

Strike the background music by the Commodores, "Three Times a Lady"..."yes, you're once, twice, THREE times a laaaady. And I loooove youuuuu!" Yep. After C4. After The Clarendon Kitchen. We now have Gallo Blanco. And I am muy happy about this. The carne asada tacos are heavenly! Perfectly seasoned and served in the cutest taco rack. I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views. Including our bedroom window...ooops...maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. OMG. We just confirmed our trip to Disney World! Gotta go! Oh. Eat here. NOW!

I live across the street from Gallo Blanco and yoouuuu don't...na na na na na naaaaa! So I've yelped the delicious tacos and creamy, lumpy, salty beans and even the mango beverage I had last month that I wanted to swim in...and now I have to say I would sell my mother to the North Korean's (I hear they have two openings for hard labor camp) for the AMAZING corn on the cob and the chocolate pudding. Every time I eat the chocolate pudding, and let's not fool ourselves my yelpitas, it has been several, several times, I conjure up a particular scene from the American Pie movie. Nuff said.

The Odd Couple. Resort style. Upon checking in with my hardcore, partying restaurant kin for a manager/chef retreat, we discovered the resort was saturated with over 1,000 (yes, that's 1,000) families for a church conference. Agnes of God! Seriously, I thought? How will this pan out? Well, Rickie and I had a gorgeous second story cottage. Which was a large, beautiful suite overlooking fountains, flowers and fanatics. First jab at the religious folks. We spent the afternoon poolside drinking mojitos, pina coladas, and Dos XX. Anytime the swarm of God's children splashed or came to us in the pool, we chanted "Too closey, no splashy." They did some sort of sign of the cross thing and off they swam. Jab number two. The poolside service was outstanding...thank you, er um, God Bless you Brian, our quick witted, Atheist server. The grounds were impeccable. Front desk service was professional. And our room's lil fridge was stocked to the gills. Anyone who knows me, knows I'm a huge FLW nut, and love all of his architecture and those that he inspired. You truly feel his spirit here at the Biltmore. Especially after boozing it up in the afternoon sun. As we sat in the spa today, awaiting our masseuses, we noticed front page news in the AZ Republic, announcing a $300 million Biltmore renovation. And. Well. It's a good thing. Cracked paint. Buckled ceilings and dated furniture. Though badly needed. Did not mar the ambiance, energy and joy we experienced for our retreat. Standing in line for our $6 bagel and $8 smoothie, we overheard the church goers behind us actually praying for lower prices. Wow. Does that work? Jab number three. I didn't stick around to find out. We headed back to our suite. And actually ended up watching Bruce Almighty. Coincidence? I think not.

Step into The Parlor said the hostess to the guy...and while I wouldn't say we stepped in (it was more of a skip)...we did find ourselves immediately pleased with the decor. Herb garden lining the sidewalk, bar windows wide open, fireplace straight ahead and an interior that may rattle my heavenly friend, St. Francis. Get it? Heavenly? Saint?   Um...well...anyhoo...the few times I've been there was always that awkward post lunch-pre dinner time (around 2ish)...we were always greeted and seated immediately. That can be an easy time to be forgotten in a restaurant.  I had dreams about the Pesto Pasta after my first visit. It was weird. Pesto Pasta and I were on a cruise where Chaz Bono was performing Send In The Clowns. She kept throwing chunks of Parmesan at us from the stage calling us Parlor Gays. Then a huge unicorn came from above and ate her.   I don't know what that means. But that has to be one full unicorn.   Spinach salad and calamari are big weiners here...wait, I mean, winners here. Winners. Love the tropical ice tea. Service was a solid B+. LOVE the 2 price options on the pasta dishes. I try to eat my cheat foods in fist size portions. Ok. No fist jokes from the randy gays. Please.   Welcome to the neighborhood said The Culinary Comedian to The Parlor.

Really gays? What has happened to us? We've become so serious. So mainstream. So. Oh dear. How do I say this...so, so heterosexual! GASP!   Strollers. Parents. Pets. Lacoste shirts. Topsiders. Soccer moms. Soccer dads. And in my best Sarah Palin voice, "Joe 6 packs". Just normal folks don't ya know. You betcha.   Where are the inappropriately dressed men in Speedos, glitter and nipple tassels? Dykes on bikes? Minors tripping on E? What has happened to our luster people? Have we become....um, boring?   Well, I"m not sure. But the Rainbows Festival is darn fun. A small town feel, in a lovely urban setting, filled with the usual food vendors, t-shirts booths and local organizations hawking their wares and services. But overall, the genuine feeling of fun, love and celebration permeated this event.   Lots of smiles, hugs and waves. And yes, lots of families of all types. And, really, that is what it's all about right. We noshed on turkey legs, tacos and swilled Bud and fruity vodka drinks. Ten bucks to park, but free to get in. How cute and small town is that? Well, not the parking maybe. But who doesn't love a free party?   Rickie and I had a blast and at the end of our Rainbow, we found a bag full of condoms, lube and free minutes for a gay sex site. Ahhh, my people! Girls and gays just wanna have fun! See ya next year. And don't forget the nipple clamps!

Spotless! Service. Dining room. Restrooms. Patio. Spotless!!  Next time I shall forgo table seating and plop my butt on the floor to eat. Yep. That's how clean Hula's is!  Service was polished and friendly. Dana was working the brunch crowd and attending to everyone's needs. Most importantly everyone enjoyed their brunch.  I say Bula Bula to Hula's!!

Like Samantha, I hate wires. Wire hangers, television wires and yes, even Wire Terriers. And yes, sometimes, in my best Faye Dunaway doing her "best" Joan Crawford I may scream "NO MORE WIRE HANGERS! Or in this case, "NO MORE DANGLING ELECTRICAL WIRES OVER MY DESK BECAUSE THEY ARE FREAKING ME OUT!"  Yeah. Something like that.  Mike is a delight. Prompt. Clean. Smart. Amiable. Affordable. He got my patio speakers up and running and took care of those unseemly visible wires. He educated me on my system and something about amps and voltage and woofers I think. I hope I wrote it down.   Cuz I know my way around the back of a stereo like I know my way around a_________. *you can fill in the blank*

OK. Just so you know. When they arrive at your door with your ice, they've already heard "OH!. THE ICEMAN COMETH"! Or "OH, IT'S SO nICEEEEE TO SEE YOU"! Or "ICE ICE BABY ICE ICE BABY"! Hey, I'm just looking out for ya. I have to say, AZ Iceman has saved my icey ass on more than one occassion. Usually the ice machine next to my office is so loud producing cubes I fear a major hail storm has moved in and nobody has alerted me. Lately. Not so much. She's a tempermental one, that ice machine. So a call to AZ Iceman yields an always polite employee who quickly dispatches the Iceman. Soon my cocktails, teas and sodas are fizzy, happy and cold once again. Like Liza Minelli on her wedding night. I don't know what kinda deal you would get, but I shelled out around $70 for 400 pounds of ice. Yes. You heard me. Four hundred pounds. It's like having Carney Wilson delivered, only in the form of ice cubes. I c u soon.

I love the juxtaposition of Modern Steak. A straight forward, steak house type menu in an Elton John over the top decorated space. My goal, one day, is to swing from chandelier to chandelier while chowing on my Kobe burger.   Our service was swift, friendly and well...practically perfect. The soft sour cream and chive butter with the foccaccia style bread is a total knockout. I was smearing it on my lips like Carmex. We started with the lobster chowder which was served in these hot metal bowls. Chowder was ok. Not amazing and definitely could have used some seasoning (nutmeg, allspice!?)...lobster was adequate, if not a little chewy. Mac n cheese was also good, but nothing to make me do my Meg Ryan from When Harry Meets Sally impersonation.   The Kobe Burger? Total home run! Outstanding. Perfectly cooked. Love the homemade 1,000 island, the applewood bacon...all yummy yummy. As were the fries which were served with a side of ketchup. Missing was the trendy aioli that so many other restaurants seems to offer now.   Modern Steak gets a solid 3.5 stars Love the textures and colors and am looking forward to swinging by again soon.

Only in AZ. We survive months and months of triple digits. Longing for a break in the temps. Will it ever be 80 degrees again? Will my electric bill stop looking like a mortgage? Will my ass not stick to my car seat? Only in AZ, on the first cool night, does a customer laugh when I ask if they'd like to sit on the patio. In my face. Laugh! "Oh no. It's freezing out!" Really? Freezing. Try waiting for a school bus at 5:30 in the pitch black of a December morning in Minnesota. But. It got me thinking. I need new heaters. I googled. Found AZ Patio Heaters and received the best customer service. Friendly. Professional and very thankful for my business. Made me feel warm all over. Get it. A patio heater review and I feel warm? Ok. I'm trying people. Anyway if you're in need of such merchandise I cannot recommend them enough. Ask for Joe.

Somedays you're hot. Somedays you're cold. Well. AZ Patio Heaters you are cold to me! Cold I say! COLD! I wasn't pleased with the heaters. I didn't know we had to assemble them. Like an IKEA dresser. 300 parts!  Yep. Over 300 parts I had to assemble. Well. Ok. My handyman had to assemble. But I supervised with a crisp glass of Chardonnay. You said for $75 you would come to my business and check things out. *Cue the Jeopardy theme music*....yeah...keep it going...cuz they NEVER came! Bad customer service. Polite on the phone. Even enthusiastic. But no follow through. I had intended to buy three more. NOT! OMG! Now you have me drumming up lame pop culture references from the early 90s for goodness sakes! Do you see how rattled I am. How hot under the coals I am (pun intended). So far now, my yelpitas. I wouldn't recommend AZ Patio Heaters. Grab a Snuggie at Walgreens and keep the Patron flowing. That'll keep ya warm. Cheers!

Update 2010 people! Update 2010!  VP of AZ PH pm'ed me on yelp. Asked me about my experience. I so appreciate that follow through as I try my best to do that for my business. He listened, I mean really listened...and the problem was finally repaired. Though having my patio heaters repaired in June is kinda of a cruel joke, I'll be ready for those harsh Arizona winters.   Thank you AZ Patio Heaters for righting the wrong. You've got my business back.

Like Gabi, I'm not really a retro, vintage kinda gal. Er, um guy. Yea guy! I like new things. Things that don't smell of mothballs. Or pee. I like Crate and Barrel, Eurway and Copenhagen. But not only is Retro Redux fun and filled with 1950s to 1970s goodies. I swear the spirit of the Brady's and Partridge families lives on in these four walls! Rickie bought me a fantastic wooden bowl, made with individual pieces of wood. Sort of retro Asian meets midwest rec room popcorn bowl. Going here puts me in a good mood and should do the same for you. Friendly staff and approachable prices. So put on your favorite Garanimals outfit (c'mon, remember??!!) and those knee high socks with the two stripes on top and your Kinney's (yes Kinney's, the Great American Shoe Store, aka GASS) and get in the VW van and high tail it down to Retro Redux. And on your way stop off for a refreshing Fresca or Tab!

I love America. I love tacos. Not always in that order, but let's continue. I've been a few times already. And have yet to order a taco. That's because America's Taco Shop could easily be named America's Quesadilla Shop. But, we know, that wouldn't stick. I've had the carne asada quesadilla with lettuce, guac and monterey jack. Definitely on the smaller side, but hey, it's $4.50. And then there's that Mexican Coke. Pricier than the U.S. Coke. Oh. Wait. We're talking beverages here folks. I left the 80s behind years ago! Yep. Mexican Coke has REAL sugar and not HFCS. I"m not a real anti HFCS kinda guy...but let's just say, this Mexican Coca Cola really rocks my meats and cheeses! But, it's $3. So you gotta feel in a fancy lunch mood. My last visit I added an order of chips and salsa. All said, with tip, was over $13.   A little pricey. But I didn't mind. Kind of like buying Kiehl products at Neiman's. Or a brick of brie at AJs. Or the expensive toilet paper with chamomile and lotion. Worth it! Especially the latter. I"m just sayin'!  Great service. Friendly, if not a bit too aggressive. Last visit Miss America herself was there with her cute and chatty daughter. I loved it! Though my kids are limited to a Schnauzer, I like seeing family together in the biz.   America. America. God bless your tacos. From sea to shining sea. From 7th St. to 7th Ave. God shed your guac on me....

Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding.   Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.   Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home?   Misc: Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special. The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous. Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing! Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives.  Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest.   Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!

Dayum you Gabi! I had it my mind (fuzzy as it has been since Sunday) to be the FTR on this event. Well. Who cares! What a fabulous day. It was like seeing family. I saw industry folk, lots of yelpers and so many of my customers and neighbors from the CenPho hood!  Corn Dogs from District! Seriously. I could eat those babies for breakfast.  Gelato from Chelsea's Kitchen!? Seriously I could eat that for breakfast! Sea Scallops with pea risotto from A Different Pointe of View. Yep. Breakfast. Eggs over easy. Done deal. And the wine! The tequila. And the Dragonberry Rum. Yep. Hair of the dog. Breakfast all the way.  PAM has never looked prettier to me. And by the end of the day. Everyone I saw had never looked prettier to me. Recall the wine, tequila and rum!  Great event. GO PHOENIX FOODIES!  Five stars. Great double date with Rickie, Anton and Dave.   The only bad things was the neon green drink band clashed with my black and pink Hello Kitty bracelet.  Hmmm...

H&M. Must stand for Happy and Man. Cuz that's what I was after my shopping spree here recently. We scored three pairs of pants and three or four shirts for $150. And I'm talking styling threads dudes! Not some Buffalo Exchange leftovers. Loved that the men's section is on the entire first floor, right when you walk in. It's kind of divided up into three sections, with plenty of merchandise but not so cluttered you accidentally brush up against a strangers boobies while navigating the aisles. Would have liked a better selection of sunglasses (HELLO THIS IS ARIZONA) and belts (HELLO...Oh, I don't really have an end to this one...).   H & M. Hot Merchandise. Holy Moses. Happy Man! Yep! Can't wait to return.

Pork Belly. Smoked Salmon and Creme Fraiche. It's like Paula Deen and Wolfgang Puck got together, downed a bottle of Pinot, made culinary love and "wa la"..this is their baby. A thin crust with the freshest ingredients. I must say y'all...(for the Paula) fans...it was fabulous. And "BAM" for the Wolfie fans as I am craving this as I review.   We walked into Brick on a slow Sunday evening. Didn't expect a big crowd as it was the holiday weekend. We bucked up to the bar (that's how I roll) and had immediate and friendly service from Santos.  My friend Kirk raved about the tuna tartare and he was spot on Mary. Served in a chilled martini glass with lightly cinnamon dusted fried won tons. This was a crunchy, fresh, delicious culinary experience. I even added it to my Oprah grateful journal. The "corn cakes" (more like pancakes) with more silky smoked salmon were good. Hard to follow heaven in a glass. I cannot for the life of me remember the third appetizer. Hmm...is that not a good sign?  I know I sipped a bit of Kirk's Spritzer. Yep. Spritzer my gays and friend of gays. But this wasn't your mama's spritzer. This had Hendrick's Gin and it was fabulous!   Undeniably named after all the brick walls, Brick also had a modern, fresh feel. When I think of Brick I think of lick. As in finger lickin' good. Can't wait to return!

Comfort. Let me spell it out for ya Mary.   Cool! Oh sooo good Modern. Urban. Cozy Fabulous. Fabulous staff. Fabulous clientele. Fabulous room. Oh sooo good. Relaxed. Yet energetic. Vibrant.  T. Hmmm. T...Totally will visit again!  The seared tuna app was outstanding with a crusty, herbed seared edge. My chicken and dumplings was okay...we were seated around nine and kitchen closes at ten. Dumplings were a little, well, stiff. Much like my rigid right wing cousin. I was missing Bisquick lol. Beef bourgoninase was outstanding. And the "smore" dessert was more miss than hit for me. VERY difficult to eat.   Perhaps it was the bottle of wine that made it difficult to navigate the deconstructed dessert...or the intense light from the fullest moon EVAH!  Great time. Good food. Great service. Good God. I will. Be. Back.

Arrogant Butcher. Arrogant Bastard. Arrogant Butthole. I don't care what the name is, I had a really great time here. Finding it, however, was laughable. This whole Cityscape thing is a big FAIL to me so far. Why they didn't choose to build an open aired mall like Kierland Commons is so Bed Bath and Beyond me. The signage is horrible. The curb appeal is non existent.   But when we finally turned the corner and saw the big A, the sidewalk was bustling with guests and the inside was energetic, fun and most appealing.   I had great service. Thank you Winston! The pretzel fondue was fabulous! The scallops with bacon and beans was okay. Not exactly executed as I would have liked. And the crab stuffed chicken was actually quite bland.   But I washed it all down with a beautiful, buttery bottle of Carneros Chardonnay and all in all a good time was had.   Arrogant? Perhaps. But certainly Insecure Butcher wouldn't work. So it's a winner so far to me and I will most definitely return.

In my best Charlie Sheen, "Windsor. Winner. Windsor. Winner!"  I had the MOST attentive service from our greeting at the door, to our seating in back, to our beverage service...ooops, then a small lapse in service...no biggie I was enjoying the vibe and the ambience.  Ordered the Double Dip...sadly the name reminded me of my buddies in college when they would chew tobacco, sometimes they would "double dip"....gross I know. The concept of this dip is a cobb salad made into a dip served with a chipotle salsa (didn't get much smoky chipotle flavor however...which is fine since my little petite self is sensitive to spicy food...I mean my mom would serve potato chips and ketchup and called it chips and salsa...but I digress). I would order the dip again, but I have to say it really tasted just like egg salad. And fortunately I loves me some egg salad!  My rueben sandwich was OUTSTANDING and I chose a side of mac n cheese which was total bliss (NOT plugging a restaurant downtown btw)....that was the word I said as cheese and a chunk of elbow macaroni slid down my chin. Pleasant, I know. My friend was doing the Meg Ryan orgasm scene as he enjoyed his bbq pulled chicken sandwich.   I'm sure we looked ridiculous. But we were ridiculously happy.   Welcome to the neighborhood Windsor. Let's totally hang out more often!

Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny.

Let the Phoenix Food Truck Revolution begin!  Leading the pack in my opinion are the smiling folks in the Pizza People Food Truck..."Pie on the fly!" How awesome is that?   From the homemade dough (YES...homemade or shall I say truckmade?...) to the passionate owners to the local, fresh ingredients to the gluten free and vegan options...this food truck is on a roll baby!  The thin, crispy yet pillowy dough and the tangy marinara with the local fresh basil...OMG...let's just say I devoured every bite. And with prices around $6 you just can't beat it! You can't beat it...but you most certainly can eat it!  I can't wait to see where Pizza People park their gorgeous truck...I just want to be first in line! I even have hired them to cater my business's holiday party! You should too!  Pizza People...you are my kinda people!

I'm SO glad I went online and saw Great Clips had a 32 minute wait. I will go to Great Clips, just don't like hanging out waiting for a cut. I'm SO glad I couldn't find the Super Cuts on 83rd Ave. And I'm SO glad I stumbled upon Classic Cuts nestled in a mall near a sushi restaurant.   Classic. Cuts. Just as the name states. Inside is an old school barber shop with the smell of Old Spice, thick wooden, oak shelves and a billiard table. Yep. A billiard table. How manly am I now??!!  Not only that, my barber's name was Jerry. Jerry the barber. How cool is that??!! He was awesome. Super polite. Personable in the beginning but then buckled down and cut my follicaly challenged scalp. Now get this...  ...I thought he was finished. Nope. I felt and smelled some awesome shave cream on my neck and sideburns. My first ever hot, straight blade shave. Followed by a hot towel. Heaven in a barber chair. All the while I was facing not the mirror, but a flatscreen tuned in to the Pawn Stars on the History Channel.   Highly recommended. Ask for Jerry.  Oh, also learned photos of Jimi Hendrix can go for $15,000 while a haircut from Jerry is a mere $15! What a great Monday!  Hurry up hair! Grow back before I move!

Shabby Chic meets Alice in Wonderland. DO NOT consume magic mushrooms before entering here. LOTS of little fairies, butterflies, yard gnomes, inspirational signs that say "Your mind is your garden" and annoying things like that. It is a tiny tiny tiny little spaced crammed with such things. I feel a bit like Tony Shaloub from Monk as my anxiety intensifies from being in such clutter. But the flowers! Oh, the flowers. They are a sight to behold. And the staff and the owner are artists at what they do. Prices were not exorbitant as I expected. A great place to support. Non chain. And if you're lucky, one of the little fairies might even wink at you!

You would think the highlight of my recent Arizona vacation would be spending hours by the fabulous Clarendon Hotel & Spa pool. Or the complimentary foot massage. Or even taking my traveling mates to their first drag show.  Nope.   Pinots Palette stole that thunder! What a FUN evening...We brought wine, chocolate and our smiling Minnesota faces and couldn't have had a better time.  The staff is Bed, Bath & Beyond friendly, outgoing and really good dancers. Yep. Drinking wine and painting does lead to dancing!    They supply you with everything you could possibly need from art supplies to wine glasses to music! And dancing. Did I mention the dancing?!  So brush up on your artistic talents, call your buddies and head to Pinots Palette and paint the town red!

Sunrise Taxi. Sounds so fictional. Like the taxi you'd hail in a fictitious town. Like Pine Valley. But anything with the word sun in it is appropriate for Phoenix, right?  While most of their vehicles look as though they just left a county fair smash up derby, they'll haul you around the Valley of the Sun for much cheaper than the other rides. A jaunt from Indian School to 16th St. and Bethany Home runs just under $8. While that same journey in a Discount Cab, cost close to $13. The key is find a fave driver, get his cell phone, a walla, you're an instant big shot, with a driver at your disposal. Why Britney Spears hasn't caught on to this, I'll never understand.
