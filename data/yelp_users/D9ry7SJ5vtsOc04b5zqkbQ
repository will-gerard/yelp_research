A nice find in Phoenix. Good menu, something for everyone. I had Gnoochi which was terrific, others at my table had chicken, veal and salmon and all enjoyed their meal.  The wait staff is nice and attentive and they don't rush you out.  You can linger as long as you want. I imagine it would be very nice to have your meal outside on the patio but it was a little chilly the night we were there. Yes I would return for sure.

Houston's we got a problem!!! What happened to this place.  In days past the menu was plentiful, the food was great and prices were reasonable.  This no longer exists.  I don't know how on earth this place can survive.  The food was terrible, some too cold, some just plain old bad! The wait staff to interested in turning a table, when in fact it wasn't even crowded, literally interupted a conversation taking place between two of my guests to ask if we wanted dessert. Have you no home training???  Frankly if I could give no stars I would do that.  Wake up a smell the competition or you will be out of business in the blink of an eye.

We had a very large group in town for a meeting. We selected Pinnacle Peak Patio for a night out. The place was perfect.  We added in line dancing, a DJ, a story teller and photo booth.  The food was surprisingly good. The group had a terrific time.

Please open up in NJ!!! I was in from out of town and wanted a casual dinner.  Great menu, terrific, polite wait staff, nice ambiance. The hostess team was lovely, out server was knowledgable and efficient. This is what a casual dinner should look like.  Good luck and keep doing what you are doing!

I only wish that there was a Hello Bistro in my neighborhood. I only had a salad but it was terrific fresh and huge. It could have easily fed two people big you like salad stop by because you will truly enjoy what they hBe to offer. Either pick from their pre designed salads or design your own. Really great.

A really unique and comfortable restaurant with food to match.   The decor is different and original. The service is terrific. The food is comfort food with a twist.   Breakfast was delicious from the hash browns, to the buttermilk biscuit and topped off with the blue corn ricotta pancakes.   Wonderful, different and appetizing menu choices, not your run of the mill fare.   I imagine lunch and dinner are as much fun. Worth a trip back for another meal.   Four Seasons hit the nail on the head with this one. Job well done.

We arrived with a group of ten tired and hungry business associates. We were greeted with a big smile by Yvonne.  We ordered a round if drinks and wine for everyone to relax with along with some appetizers. We had lettuce wraps and homemade guacamole - all of which was thoroughly enjoyed.   The popovers were a great surprise and absolutely delicious.  We all ordered different items from Caesar salad to short ribs, everything was cooked to perfection.   Service was top notch, decor is gorgeous, food was delicious.    We had made our reservation on Open a Table and they even called us from the restaurant to ask if we preferred sitting inside or outside.   Not your run of the mill hotel restaurant. A real pleasant surprise!
