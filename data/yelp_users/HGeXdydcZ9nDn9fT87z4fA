Fish was good, atmosphere stunk, service was incredibly slow, and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis.  Although my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty.  Then he completely forgot to let me order an entree.  Meanwhile it took 45 minutes to get my appetizer.  The entree came pretty promptly thereafter though.    Overall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it.

I would say this is definitely the best seafood I have had in AZ so far.    Really great food and great decor as well.  You pull up and wonder if you are in the right place but then you enter and go downstairs and see that the entire place is underground.  It all looks and feels like the inside of a ship and its surprisingly a very nice feeling.  We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and then the stuffed lobster and the king crab legs.  Everything was very good.    Crab Cakes - They were great.  Not huge but great.  Almost no breading so tons of crab and a very nice dipping sauce that I can't recall.  Stuffed Lobster - Nicely sized lobster with all of the meat intact (sometimes I feel that places replace some of the meat with the stuffing to use the meat elsewhere).  The stuffing was very good but seemed like a lot of breading.  Very nice dish though.  King Crab Legs - These were great.  Very fresh.  No saltiness, fishiness, or hint of freezer burn that you get many times with king crab legs.  Quite a nice touch that the waitress cracks all of the shells for you tableside and even leaves all the kunckle meat easily accessible.  All the legs were an ok size but not huge.  They were cooked perfectly though.  Overall I would say great seafood and a menu with tons of variety and fresh items.  It was a little over priced though.  Pretty much every dish was at least $30 and most were high $30s.  Not obnoxiously expensive but a little much.

Great Place!  I'm from NY so I was skeptical about the sushi in AZ.  It was great...very great.  Yellowtail with ponzu sauce and chili or something like that was amazing.  Good sushi selection too, I recommend one of the Nigori's.  Bartender was very friendly and helpful and made eating at the bare much more enjoyable.

i would say this place is pretty good.  granted it was a monday night but i was almost the only other person there.  i ate at the bar and the bartender was very nice though.  the fajitas are so-so but the special margarita was pretty good though.  I will have to try on a more popular night to see if it is fun.

This place is amazing.  One of my two favorite spots in AZ so far.    The lobster quesadilla is awesome.  not your typical quessadilla but way way better.  the flank steak torta was very good too.  i can't wait to go back and try everything else.

This is the best meal i've had since i've been commuting to AZ from NY.  the food is so so good and the setting is comfortable and warm.  I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this place.  I think it will become a weekly haunt.  I had one of the fish specials and the sauce was just amazing.  Everything I had was great.

I thought Trader Vic's was very nice.  Food was very good.  Atmosphere was great.  Staff was very very friendly and fun.  They even gave me tons  of recommendations of places to eat in the area since I am new around here.    I recommend the lamb.

I had lunch here and enjoyed it very much.  The menu is very diverse and loaded with good fish and other seafood.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was quick...although a little over attentive.  I will definitely try dinner her.

I had heard all kinds of good things about this place, so I was dying to try it.   I have to say that I was terribly disappointed in the food...especially for the price.  I had: - black cod - unsuccessful derivative of a similar dish at Nobu.  tasted a bit fishy.  flavor was ok but a little bland. - wagyu beef rolls (sp?) - they said this won sushi of the year in London.  i thought it was just ok at best.  too salty and very little taste of beef.   asparagus - this was very good but i could easily make this on my own grill  the portions were also very very small, which is probably to be expected but still.    the decor is great though and service was ok...just ok.  anyway, i think they are going to have to try a good bit harder if they want to continue to operate this way.  people will start to realize that the food just isn't very good.

I would put this up against the best steak in NY.  Wolfgang's in NY still gets my top place but Mastro's City Hall is great.    Incredible steak and sides.  I had the bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly.  Great cut of meat.  Also had a tremendous bowl of delicious lobster mashed potatos.    Beware of all the butter though...there is plenty of it!  Entertainment in the lounge area is great too.  Not your typical lounge singer but a guy playing the guitar along with a pianist will entertain you all night with Top 40 hits in a lounge singer fashion.
