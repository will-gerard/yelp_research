Cool neighborhood grocery store.  The have more of the specialty items... it's not like you can get everything here.  They do have a good Sandwich bar and also make great pizza's and salads at the restaurant end of the store.

This is the best pizza in Tempe!  Make no mistakes.  I lived there for a year about 2 years ago and I still miss Tessio's.  It is just a carry out & delivery place.  I think they got a few plastic chairs and maybe a table with some NewTimes on it, but not really a place to dine in.  Tessio's also tends to have good deals if you want to throw in some wings or whatever.  You can also pick up some beer right next door to go with your pizza.

Chris Bianco has made this into a pizza experience.  You sort of forget it is pizza.  You will have to wait!  It's just the way it is.  The experience begins with Chris taking care of you by opening a wine bar right next to his pizza place so you can tie one or 5 on while you wait.  Everyone is treated like a rockstar in this place, but if you have a rockstar friend go with... you will still have to wait, but it makes it more fun while the locals eye you.  Famous People Eat here!  that should be Bianco's Slogan.   That and Oh yeah it is the best pizza.

Very good.  The staff is warm and friendly.  The atmosphere is nice and very clean.  The pizza and salads are tasty.  Not lacking much here.

Location, style, exactly what I was looking for!  Classy but with gay twist.  It is one of the best places to stay in Phoenix.  Except they could have had a better more comfortable bed.  Maybe it was just our bed?  Maybe room 324 is the last room due for a new bed.    I'll go back and stay here again for sure.  Crossing my fingers about the bed.

One year the local rag reader mag.  voted this place in the annual "best" issue... "The best place to take someone from Tucson to make them feel like they are in Tucson"  This is a compliment.  I love pita jungle.  The Chicken and humus appetizer is great... get the humus half red pepper and half jalape√±o.  Also, the Menchilada is enough grub for a few days.

There is a taco bell across the street.  I have no idea how a person could go there with this place right across the street.  Cheap and real Mexican!

The Phoenix scene is here.  If you are in a band and you are good you play here.

I make sure to stop in here every time i am in the Phoenix area.  Great music and excellent service make this a place worth checking out for a few of their cheap drinks.  Tuesday evenings a great house band called Chocolate Fountain will keep you grooving!  Great local bands take turns filling the stage through out the rest of the week and weekend.  Venus is one of the nicest bartenders in the valley and she will pour you an honest drink as will all the staff behind this bar.  Oh yeah bar shuffleboard on hand for the sporty types.

Shitty burrito served by an angry old hippy.  I asked if the guac had onions, and he answered "yeah, but you can't taste it!" to which I replied "then why's it there" and then he said "for flavor, but you can't taste it"  then said angry old hippy talked smack about me to his coworker while I was still in earshot.  Worst burrito ever made by someone who honestly doesn't dig his job.  He lacked customer service, a sense of humor and the ability to whisper.  Fuck you old hippy & fuck you blue burrito!
