Biggest dog track waste of money golf course in Arizona.  They fool you with a nice clubhouse and mountain scenery but be course itself is beyond awful.  Even in the peak season when grass grows and the weather is great they can't seem to keep the course in even decent shape!!! Dirt and ground under repair all over the fairways and greens!!!  ALL YEAR LONG GARBAGE!!!!  I've played here several times over the last 7 years and it gets consistently worse each time.   Today was the last straw!  I wanted to give it one more chance figuring the weather has been great and we got a ton of rain this year.  Big mistake!!!  Course was in terrible shape as usual.. Worse than ever!!!  Then to cap it off, not only did they overbook as usual, but they let a 5-some with 4 women go out in front of us!!!!   And they were all clearly beginner golfers with no etiquette.  We had to skip a hole to get past them because they wouldn't let us play through.. The other 2 guys in out group went home after 2 1/2 holes it was so bad!!!  Never playing here again!!!!!!  And if you are from out of town or a local I suggest you go anywhere else but here!!!     I didn't even mention that it's overpriced for a garbage course.. Should be $10 not $50.  Get with it Foothills.. You should be embarrassed!!!

Camron and his team did awesome work on my back patio.  He didn't try to oversell me on something that I didn't need but gave me great advice on what would work best in my space.   The price was fair, they were always on time and cleaned up everything.  When I made a few last minute changes, Camron was on the spot and always thought of the customer first!   The job was seamless from start to finish! I would highly recommend this company for any concrete work that you need done!

Great service!  My house keys were stolen from my car. Johnny Locksmith came out 20 minutes after I called them and quickly rekeyed 2 doors for me.  The technician was friendly and the pricing was fair.  I definitely recommend their service.
