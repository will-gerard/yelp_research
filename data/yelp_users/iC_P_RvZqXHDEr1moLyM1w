The doctors and practitioners are great, but whenever I have to deal with the front window it's aggravating.  They have you fill out a document for a change as simple as a phone number.  My insurance administrator changed, "here, fill this out"  99% of the info they already had, it was just the name of the insurance and the phone data that changed and that's as simple as scanning the card and attaching it to my computer file.

PHX bills it self as "America's friendiest airport".  SO NOT TRUE.  America's friendliest airport took 3 of 4 moving sidewalks out of service instead of one at a time.  This is area is half of the concourse connector bewtween low A and low B (N2 and N3) in Terminal 4 north.  Signage: poor to non existent.  If it's there, it's not placed well. Years and years of poor planning.  PHX Sky Harbor management would do well to tour other airports to see what ideas they might be able to borrow.  For instance, ditch all the carpet and go with tile.

Time warp banking. Very low tech. Like banking in the early '70s. Ditched their checking account, but kept the Visa Credi Card.  The free checking was nice because it would refund the fees that other banks charge for using their ATMs. But the customer has to do all the work by saving the receipts and mailing to Birmingham, AL. Other banks offer this but the computer system keeps track and automatically rebates the fees at the end if the cycle. If you complain about it the just say "This is the way we do it"

This location closed mid December 2011.  They have directed members to the LA Fitness at University & Stapley.  LA Fitness purchased a large number of Bally's, and are closing them/consolidating them to LA locations.

Got hosed on my award item. I ordered a grande Pike and had a Protein Bistro box. The barista actually asked which item did I want to have for free. Duh, the more expensive one, the protein bistro. So he punched in a few things scanned my phone and then entered in the coffee. Later I noticed my card balance was down to .09 and still showed an available award. So he had charged me for both items. Then several hours later the  balance was .09 and no remaining rewards.  What ever he did, I should still have about $2 left on the card.  Ripped off!!

I have been a member of this gym for over 10 years.  Has everything.  Business has slowed down, you can actually be there after 4pm (traditional rush hour) and its busy, but not crowded like it used to be.  They have been repainting over the last few weeks.  Construction supplies are stacked up in the aerobics room.  Some of the equipment is old, and the place could use a spruce up equipment wise, but most of it all works just fine.  Strange thing goin on with pricing. They now offer $9.95 per month, no contract.  Will have to look into getting my billing adjusted as I'm out of contract, month to month at $33

My membership is ending in a couple of weeks.  I was being charged $30something a month and the new rate of $9.99 requires a $100 conversion fee.  Since I have 24Hour Fitness for almost free, I decided to cancel Gold's.  This is a good location.  They have updated the appearance, but some of the equipment is over 10 year old and could use replacement.  There is a leg raise machine that has been broken for over 2 months.  There must be a part that's hard to get, but 2 months is too long.

I have been to this store with two different cars over the years.  The car I took in today has always been to the dealer because I have free oil changes.  The brakes needed service according to the dealer, but I did not want to drive into downtown PHX.  Brake Masters took a look and said that I didn't need new pads, just resurfacing of the disc rotors.  The dealer would have told me new pads and rotors.  $189 at Brake Masters, over $600 at the dealer for work that was not necessary.

Wedge shaped inside and very cramped. There's about 15 people crammed around the pickup counter, the condiment stand is not accessible at all. Then when it cleared,  there are other cream carafes.  Starbucks deliberately keeps the stores small like this so their sales per square foot metric comes in high. There's one store I've been in that's. It cramped and this is not it. Boise ID on State St. should be their model.

Horrible parking.  If you take the parallel spaces, look out for people backing out.  If you take the regular space, look out for the parallel cars.  The best place to park is on the south side of their lot, or just past the drive thru area. I got a little ticked off today.  I dont have a BofA checking account so I had to see a human to make a payment.  The lines were long.  Only one designated merchant teller with a lot of merchant activity, so the lines moved really slow. Then the teller that took my payment saw that I was paying with a check from a Credit Union, so she looked up my other services and started to ask me questions about my CU checking account.  She was trying to cross-sell me.  If you want to have your employees cross sell, at least train them to what kind of products you are trying to steer your clients off of.  She could not comprehend that my CU pays me to use my checking account.  2.25% int on balances under 1,000 and rebates all atm fees up to $20.  Nothing BofA would ever offer

Great store.  I remember back when it was  Smitty's Big Towne #7.  The company changed ownership several times over the past 30 years.  It picked up the "MarketPlace" name when it was a Fred Meyer MarketPlace.  When Kroger bought FM, it was rebranded Fry's MarketPlace.    It's clean, always well stocked, the best produce of any store near it (except Sprouts @ Southern/McClintock) Maybe someday they may convert it to a Signature Marketplace.

2nd time this month.  I really like how the meal is up to me as to what's in it.  Pile on what you like.  The sauce/spice menu is a little overwhelming, but in the end the food tastes great everytime.  The sauce/spice menu needs to be placed where you can see it before you start.  Genghis Grill has a number board and every item has a series of numbers over it.  If #10 looked really good to you, then you grabbed every item that had 10 on it.  etc etc.    This YC has been here a long time and definitely has some loyal followers.  I have not been in years since this month.   It works out great for Paleo, but you have to watch which sauces you get because of the type of oil, or that it has sugar in it.

My first experience with Discount Tire was about 4 months ago.  I had a bolt punture a rear tire and needed it removed and the hole repaired.  Now, some stores will do those types of repairs for free and most others do not.  To my surprise, Discount did not charge me and the tires on the car were the original tires from when the car came out of the factory.  So when I left from this experience, I thought I have to come back when I need new tires.  I went back yesterday.  Being on a budget, I looked up several stores for my tire size.  Most have the same prices on their web site. Discount has a store about three miles from house, so made an online appointent for my tire change.  When I went in the next morning, I was a little early like they suggested.  They checked the car to verify that I needed new tires, and that they could work on it.  That was about about 9:58.  By 10:17, the car was finished and sitting at the curb ready for me to take it home.  I have never had all 4 tires changed so fast and so professionally.  Costco and Sams' can take a couple of hours.    Discount takes walk ins, but if you know you are going in and know what kind of tire and the size, book the appointment on-line.  It really helped and I will now buy my tires from them from now on.  BTW they are locally owned!  Their headquarters are in Scottsdale.

Great service and trustworthy. I was told by another business that I needed to have my front brakes worked on and at the time with the oil change, it was going to cost over $500.  I was also told that I had 5% or less of my front pads before they would start causing damage to the rotors. I dropped the car of today around noon at Brake Masters and was called back 30 minutes later.  They had evaluated that the pads actually had 25% left and that wasn't necessary yet.  I elected to go ahead because its one of those things you know it's coming up and I was already there.  Price was also way better than Tony's Auto. Brake Masters is not a rip off.  This was the second time another establishment had told me I needed to have a repair, and Brake Masters said it didn't really need to be performed yet. I am now a permanent repeat customer!

Bashas' markets are so sad. Even this renovated store is a disappointment.  Today I went to cafe counter for lunch. Geez, no wonder the company had a bankruptcy a few years back. The whole ordering process was so disjointed. It was after 11am and the sign indicated breakfast items and pizza. The hot items for lunch were incomplete and had no signage. About half of the space still needed items to sell. I got a pork chop, some chorizo Mac 'n cheese and a cold salad. The cold salad involved walking to the deli counter to select then back to the cafe counter to pay.  I had not been In the store in over a year, and after that, probably never again.  Sad, the store is visually appealing but falls flat on service, and execution. If you want to compete with the Nationals, you have to look at how they do it and try to improve it.

If you're looking for healthy food, you probably wont find it in here.  This is a very popular greasy spoon kind of place.  I've only been here for breakfast, but it's very popular.   Some of the seating areas are very close together, so you'll feel like you're sitting at the table with strangers Decorated like a 1960's single wide trailer.

I took my hybrid if for a check up.  I bought it used from a 3rd party.  It's a pretty good bike, but I don't know anything about the bicycle maintencce.  I thought it probably needed tires at the least.  On fIrst look they told it didn't need tires and they steered me to a lower priced service (really honest :-) )  They called me and said it was ready or ready in 10 if I wanted to go ahead with the replacement of the chain.  Same day return!!  honest service and pricing

This 24Hour Fitness is THE disappointment of all their locations in the Phoenix area.  The freeweight area is too small, and the machine area still has machines from the late 80's that are tired and worn out.  This club is also overshadowed by the much newer Mesa location 3 miles away, and the Chandler club 7 miles away.   They finally moved the old electric LifeFitness equipment out last year and moved the express equipment in their place.   This is roughly the same building style and layout of Phoenix, and Scottsdale, but not equiped the same.   In need of a makeover!

Two years later...Parking lot has been resurfaced and the huge pot hole was repaired.  The equipment up stairs have been moved around, the older machines have been moved to the back and the Nautilus are out front by the main aisles.  Thats kind of deceiving to potential new customers.  The old stuff isn't noticed as easily.  I originally joined at Chandler and moved up to this area 5 years ago, so I have been going to the Tempe club ever since.  Local management changes all the time.  But I think the main problem is corporate doesn't give them the budget to make the place right.  This is one of three locations in Phoenix that were former Q-The Sports club.  The each have buildings that are very similar, but are not in the same condition. Tempe is still the neglected one.  Someday maybe this could be a Super Sport like the one in Mesquite TX.  Same building design(former Q).  Mesquite is a perfect example of what Tempe could be.

It's been a few years since I was member of ACCU but I didn't leave with bad experience.  Far from it.  I just needed a CU that was a member of the CO-OP ATM Network.  Since I'm out of town a lot, I wanted the ability to deposit at an ATM and CO-OP offers that. Yes, ACCU is a member of Shared Branching, I just needed that little extra they didn't have.

A real IMAX theatre, not just named one.  It has the trademark 4 story tall screen.  An IMAX movie will cost more than the standard screen, but it's worth the experience.   Try to plan your visit.  Use the restroom before the movie, and drink your beverage slowly.  The stairs to go to or from your seat are a steep grade.  Also, during a crowded showing, it might be difficult to get to your seat.  Those with vertigo should be careful

Looks like I'm in good company when I say I dislike Cox Communications.  My experiences are across several properties, in different areas.    My problem with them is primarily the way they handle service interruptions.  When you call in to report an outage, if you are the first caller to report, it's not considered a system fault, it's just you.  They make you schedule a service appointment, making the point of telling you that you will be charged if you're not home when the tech arrives, and charged if its a problem with the wiring in your house.  When the third caller reports the outage, only then is it treated as a system outage and your service appointment is cancelled and a tech is sent out.    I had an argument with a support person one time.  I refused to do all the 'turn this off, unplug this, turn that back on....' It was a waste of time as far as I was concerned.   A few hours later a supervisor called.  I thought at first he was going to tell me it was inconsiderate of me for my attitude towards the call center person, but he apologized, it was in fact an outage and that a fiber line had been cut.  I told him Cox procedures are very aggravating as it treats the problem as automatically the customer, not the system.  I will never ever have Cox Comm in any place I live.  Lucky for the sales department, no one patrols my neighborhood, or they would get an earfull!

One Costco to the next, there is usually little difference.  This club has self checkout.  Scan your card and grab a hand held.  After over 1 year, they are still fine tuning it.  I asked if it will ever be expanded and was told not until the bugs are out.  It has some issues on a daily basis.  Some of which I have experienced.  The system will go down and your entire basket has to be rescanned, or it will just not recognize something when you scan it.   If they ever get the bugs worked out, self check out is fantastic feature.

This is the branch in the parking lot, not the branch inside Fry's, Guadalupe and McClintock Tempe.  I occasionally pay my credit card bills in person.  On one particular trip they noticed that I paid with a Credit Union check.  They must have looked up in the computer to see what services I had with the bank, because the following week, someone in that branch Cold Called me and offered to review my account services that I had with Chase.  I was questioned why I no longer had a Chase checking account and why I was banking with a Credit Union.  (this was just before last falls Bank-Transfer-Day protest. I explained that I did not appreciate them calling me about this, and that I was perfectly satisfied with my credit union, and that eventuality I would have all my banking services with a credit union.   I should also mention that all my Chase accounts opted out on marketing, so they should have not called me for this.

I think the club is just fine.  For any place in town that you can work out at , there are will be some negative remarks.  This club has it's share, but they are groundless as far as I'm concerned.  This club can be cramped because of the type of building that it's in, you have to pick an off-peak time that works for you if crowds bother you.   The equipment is only a few years old and is generally in good working order. What I dislike is the lack of enforcement for re-rack rules, and the carpeting in the machines area.  The newer clubs don't have industrial grade office carpet, they have laminate flooring for the machine area and rubber mats in the free weight area.  Just get rid of the carpet.   I can't vouch for the showers, pool, or steam/sauna area but the general locker area is spacious and has about 10 sinks for cleaning up.  One observation that I've made about all of the LA F clubs that I've tried, the locker rooms are not clearly marked until you're right on them. This club is not an exception either

I am so DONE with Lowe's.  Lowe's happens to be the closest home improvement store to my house.  I used to go their first because of the convenience.  But I noticed that I was leaving empty handed, then driving two miles further to HD and finding exactly what I needed.  HD has a better version of what I'm looking for at an equal or better price than Lowe's.  Also, you're more likely to find a knowledgable employee in HD than in Lowe's.  So many times I received incorrect info from Lowe's because the clerk just did not know what they were talking about.

Extremely happy with my Dr. and all of the nurses.  I highly recommend treatment at this practice.   This probably holds true with any allergy practice, it's crowded when kids are out of school.  Be it after school or during spring/summer/winter breaks.  Plan accordingly.  The staff can tell you when the rush times are and check out the schedule they have posted on Google calendar to see if they have adjust hours, or are closed for pre holiday etc.    I have no regrets.  Stephanie A., why cant you keep your co-pay statements or your EOB's from your insurance instead of a year end statement?

Like high prices? Then definitely shop here. They have tweaked the F&E concept so many times, it's not the chain that opened back in '08. Now Yucaipa is closing 50 stores and redoing it again.  I will probably never go to F&E again. The closest store officially closed today. Bu-Bye F&E. You were so much nicer when Tesco brought you here.

This Lowe's is the closest home improvement store to my house at just a mile away.  It used to be my first stop.  But then I noticed that I was leaving and going to the Home Depot 2 miles further down Baseline Rd.  I received incorrect info so many times that I do not trust most of the clerks.  If you want someone knowledgeable, get a manager.  When I was looking into buying Vinyl dual pane windows, we went here with my rough out measurements for 5 windows, all custom sizes.  A few days later when I had decided that their price was good, I took a second look at the sales quote and discovered that the rough outs on 3 of the 5 windows were input into the proposed order incorrectly.  1 was too large and would not have fit, and the other two were too small.  Being custom order, I would have had to 'eat' the error and reorder.  And yesterday, I stopped in for a oscillating yard sprinkler.  The old fashioned kind you attach to a hose.  They had them at $5.99-$24.99, and all were junk.  So as I'm walking out a clerk asks me if I found what I needed, I smiled and said "no" and just kept walking.  No attempt to help find what I was looking for, I walked out and went to HD.

I officially have Lowe's on my NO list.  I went there today to look for a specific type of garden nozzle.  I didn't see it, so I described it to the clerk that offered help. "Oh we don't sell those anymore, we have these nice adjustable gun style nozzles"  Exactly what I did not want.  So  I put everything back and headed a mile down to the road to Home Depot.  YES they had it plus the other items that I needed.   Over the past three years, I have made many purchases for my house, and Lowes is the closest, but it always means leaving and continuing on to Home Depot.  I just wish the two stores were in each others place.

This is the club that I joined at, but I moved away 6 years ago, so I'm rarely here.  It's much newer than Tempe, so the equipment is up to date.  Rush hours are a pain, so if you can, try to go at off peak hours.  Only complaint is the water from the drinking fountains.  Chandler water is funky and has a moldy taste to it, so bring a full water bottle and don't refill at the club, buy another from the vending machine if you run out.

I have never ever had a bad experience.  I've been coming here since late '07.  All of the barbers are great.  It can get really busy, so you have to be wise about times of day and day of week; and there have been times I've walked out because it would take longer than I've planned, but I've never walked away angry or disappointed.

Great store!  They just finished a light renovation and reset some of the aisles.  Now the aisles have signs projecting out from the top of the shelves and you can see from the front or back exactly where your items are and go right to them.  Searches are easy in this store.  Market Place a mile north does not have that feature.  Some sections are a bit cramped though.  The produce section now has a potato bar (not sure thats a proper name) but an entire case dedicated to several varieties of potatoes.  Looking for finger potatoes, or purple ones or yukon gold, they've got them. of course they have russets too.    Self check out is a breeze here there are 9 machines.  I prefer this store but the Market Place store is just a little easier to get to.

Quick breakfast before work. I must have been the only customer who did not have screwed up order.  It is strange though that have have to ask for artificial sweetener for coffee. The sugar is there, but the rest are below the counter The high school junior at the front register does not have the temperament to be working in this fast environment with the public. She is easily stupefied. I know, harsh way to say she's bambi in headlights.

I bought my Mazda 6 from showcase just over 2 years ago.  The salesperson was very friendly and low pressure.  But the finance guy went in for the kill and high pressured me into a extended warranty that he also misrepresented.  To this day, it's still not quite clear just whats covered and what's not covered.  Tire rotations are supposed to be covered, but I was charged today.  When I went in today for a oil change and tire rotation, they offered a car wash (by hand not machine).  I accepted.  When I got the car back they reviewed what they found, tire condition, condition of the brakes etc. Because their facility is under renovation, it proved difficult to deliver my car to me, and for me to exit the facility.  So hastily departed the facility.  It was'nt until I reached my house 20 miles away that I noticed how poorly the car was washed.  I'm to the point that I will probably pay an express lube location next time and go to Coscto for tire rotations.  It's just not worth the drive.  My maintenance rep is a great guy, he just works for a crappy dealer.

I went in today because I needed help with my phone. . It wasn't connecting to LTE.  I wasn't even in the store 30 seconds. And someone came over to help me. The fix was pretty easy.   The one flaw in their customer service is the queueing system. A clerk has to interrupt their session with another customer to acknowledge and add to the paper queue list. They should have a clerk like Verizon or AT&T has. You're greeted at the door,  and someone logs you into the computer and your name shoes up on the big screen monitor. No yelling across the sales floor, no stopping with the current customer.

Wow! An actual queueing system. It's a paper tablet at the desk, but far better than what they've had in the last. And they are not yelling hello to you from across the store, they actually come and greet you in person and explain how people will be ahead of you if they add you to the queue.    The phone I wanted to Jump to is not available in the store, sink have to wait for it to be sent from the fulfillment center.  That's the buggy part. No paid for 3 day shipping, but it's not three days from the order date, but three days from the date they actually ship it. I'm waiting a total of 6 days   T-Mobile is great but it's also a work in progress

I have tried the Tempe location two times now.  The first time was a burger and fries combo, the second was the Ahi Tuna sandwich.  The prices are reasonable.  The seating area is a little sparse, but I sat outside.  It was in the evening and cooling off, but they have gas heaters.  It was not evident that they use them, it may be a left over from a previous tenant.   Sold!  I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer!  The only thing they are missing...beer and wine.

They need to do a better job of keeping the floor clean, tables wiped down etc. The food is pretty good, a welcome changed to other fast food. But since it's cold outside and it's not practical to sit at the patio, inside is the place to go

Nice, shiny, new!  Already starting to get popular, the cars at times are full!  Time to add the third or middle car instead of running it in pairs.    A couple of things that really bother me about this train.  It's the first train system I've seen that does not have posted instructions of where to go in an emergency.    Usually on a Light rail or Subway type of train, they have banners posted on how to open the door and where to go depending on the type of track the train is on. What do you do if there's a fire?  What do you do if the train looses power and stops?  In the heat? There is absolutely nothing to inform you of this at PHX. The SkyLink at DFW has stairways to get off of the elevated track bed, PHX does not. DFW has the same brand and model of train, Bombardier.    The T-4 station faces the Southwest Airlines ramp on the south of the terminal.  During Southwest's busy times, the station smells like exhaust.  Probably not a problem if you're in the station a short time, but there are people that work right there.  They have station monitors to help newbies, they are sitting there and watching or mingling with travelers that need direction, for hours at at time. And you have the janitorial people there keeping that expensive floor clean.

The courtesy clerk apparently was not trained how to pack a grocery bag. It he's just an idiot. He dropped something on top of a plastic box of grape tomatoes which caused the tomato package to break open. His comment, oops your tomatoes sort of spilled out. I get to the car and a quarter of the container was spilled out. If the are not supposed to handle the food product, then scoop it up and run back for another one.   Not impressed Sprouts

I ended up cancelling my membership just before it hit the 1 year anniversary.  It just wasn't for me.  I liked the circuit area for when my time was limited, but they don't enforce the area, so people would often just start where ever they wanted, and not follow the redlight/greenlight timing. It's mostly a machine gym and the machines have a reduced weight stack.  You often are unable to go as heavy as you able to.   Planet likes to say that they are not a gym, well they are not.  And the people that go there really don't know what they are doing and take up a machine by just sitting there.  That just slows down everyone else! Back to LA Fitness (fortunately I never cancelled)

I did my cardio and had planned on a leg day.  I saw only one leg press machine and the guy had it loaded up with 400 pounds and was just sitting there texting.  So I went to the leg raise machine.  I very quickly found that this club has a minimal set of equipment.  Possibly because of the layout, I did not see any more than one each on the leg machines. 1 leg raise, 1 leg curl, 1 leg press.  Frustrated just enough that I gave up and walked out and finished up later at a different location.

Layout is similar to a Costco, but it's a huge discount grocery store.  Excellent produce department.  My only beef is the checkout area.  The self checkout is cramped, and they never have enough regular lanes.  I wont call those full service lanes, because you have to bag your own groceries.  But when each line has 3 people in line with full carts, there should be more lanes open. Also be aware that they do not take credit cards, or accept debit cards without the use of a PIN.  I'm not sure if they take checks.  They have super cheap quality take out salads at the deli department.  Sandwiches too.  Great to take to work.

I read about 51 on yelp and Instagram.  The pictures and comments posted don't match up with what I experienced.   The coffee served was luke warm, like it was pumped from a thermos can that should have been dumped and replaced.  The pastry case only had 'day old' doughnuts and some measly muffins.   The place reminded me of Green in N. Tempe on Scottsdale Rd.  Bohemian and stark.  Dark, and cold.  Probably will not go back.

Former 24 Hour Fitness.  It has an identity crisis right now. The building carries both signs, and the bulletin board inside says Q-The Sports Club. That's the name of the company that built the place.  This is the sloppiest club acquisition I've seen.  It makes you think that they are still not sure what clubs to keep.   The swimming pool has been drained for a couple of weeks.  No other signs of work, but there is a City of Tempe work permit posted  But a month and half, and you think they would have at least have the signage taken care of by now.
