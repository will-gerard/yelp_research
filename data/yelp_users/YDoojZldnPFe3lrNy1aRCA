The food was reasonably good but not good enough to prompt us to return. This restaurant's location make it a tourist eatery; we felt rushed through our meal. We ordered guac and chips and drinks to start, 5 mins later ordered dinner. The drinks & guac/chips (which were good) arrive 15 mins after we placed the order & our dinner (which was fair) arrived 2 mins after that. There was barely room on the table for the food, but what was more disappointing is we sensed the restaurant/server was more interested in quick table turnovers. She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert, but just brought out the bill. There are plenty of other Mex-themed restaurants in this city; the food here is not that special. This is not the place to chill and chat.

We're regulars here. Why? The food quality is as good as sports bar food should be. Our favorites are all the buffalo chicken things. My dining partner's particular favorite is the carne asada platter. Good, honest food at affordable prices. Although I advocate for "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality when it comes to many restaurant menus, it would be good to have some daily specials here.

I love having Einsteins in the neighborhood as I am a fan of their Vanilla Hazelnut coffee and the choice of bagels is terrific. The staff is friendly. But here's my only gripe. Refresh the coffee more frequently. The last few times I was there the VH coffee was just warm with no replacement in sight.

After last evening's dinner at North in Arcadia I think I can claim I've hit most of Sam Fox's valley restaurant concepts. While I admire the man's business acumen (build in trendy areas, gentrify via menu name and cooking process what otherwise is a limit selection of food choices, and make sure diners in the dining areas have direct line of sight to the bar), the actual food at any of them is forgettable. North is no different really; it does not offer anything all that wonderful to talk about. The food, essentially, is of medium catering quality. We three diners (encouraged by our server) started with an anti-pasti board of two cheeses, spicy nuts, some kind of chutney, sourdough bread & salt-cured beef. It was alright, but I could have put something this it together at home from groceries picked-up at Trader Joes that would have been better. Two of us had the same (housemade) pasta dish, while one went for the mussels and roast potatoes (both appetizers). We were all underwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients and the flavor. Maybe we made the wrong choices, but we'll never know because we're not going back.

Slanted Rice appeals to all my restaurant wants: it's owner operated, cozy, & the food is homey and delicious with satisfying yet healthy-ish options. Our favorites: chicken pho and the clay pot crispy rice beef. The Brussels sprouts appetizer is hands-down the best sprouts dish I've ever had! We get take out more often than we eat in, because this is my go-to take out place.

First time visit. Genre: made to order fast food salads and sandwiches. Food quality: good, but not excellent. Customer service: good; I don't like a lot of dressing in salad so even the "lite" volume of dressing in my Mad Molly Brown ( a salad with onion overkill, imo) was still way too much, so the manager remade it, leaving the dressing on the side. Experience: ok, I felt rushed through the ordering and decision process. Maybe if I became a regular, I'd want the process to be as fast as it was. For a first time customer it was a little confusing.

Greasy food, crinkle cut fries. Seriously folks, there are so many places to get a good burger around here. What's the big deal about this place? Spend your money elsewhere.
