Ordered a meatball sandwich with french fries for delivery; couldn't be more disappointed. The sandwich was soggy to the point the bread had disintegrated into mulch. Did they soak this thing in a bathtub for a few hours before delivering it? The fries tasted as though they'd been left to sit for much longer than they should have, and were also very soggy--my guess is that they sat in a pool of grease all night. I won't order from here again, and I recommend you don't either.

Very poor customer service. Incredibly long wait times. Avoid Scottsdale Healthcare.

I'm not normally a fan of the generic Old Town Scottsdale style restaurants and bars like Loco Patron, but I actually do like Loco. Prices are decent, food is good, and wait/bar staff are usually on point.

Food is pretty good, though somewhat overpriced for what you get. Prices are on par with BWW, and food is about the same quality, but with BWW you get a much better experience--Wingstop is kind of like a fast food restaurant inside. If there's a BWW near you, you're definitely going there, but you can be happy going to Wingstop if there isn't a BWW nearby.

Smashburger is the best combination of quality, deliciousness, and price that I've ever encountered. The food is both delicious and high quality, and the price is crazy cheap. You can get a burger, fries, and drink at Smashburger cheaper than McDonald's, yet the quality is going to be better than almost any other hamburger place. Not sure how they do it, but I love it.

Charged extra ($1) for thousand island dressing with hamburger. Really? Are they going to charge for ketchup too? So dumb.

This place used to be Dos Gringos and it was awesome. They closed down for a remodel, opened back up as Old Town Gringos, and became awful. The price of food and drinks has nearly doubled, while the quality has decreased considerably. The interior used to be unique and cool, now it's cliche and boring, just like every other Old Town Scottsdale formula bar and restaurant. The service and staff are among the worst in Old Town. Don't visit this place. Dos Gringos is dead, and this retched zombie that replaced it is a nightmare.  EDIT: In case it isn't obviously clear to anyone, most of the 5 star reviews for this place are obvious fakes. Scroll past them to find the real reviews.
