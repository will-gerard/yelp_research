I can see why people get upset with the VA the scheduling is such a headache, they screwed up my Grandpas appointment 4 times ! I forgive them but it's just unacceptable to mess up more than twice.    The Doctors & nurses are wonderful but out biggest complaint is the scheduling.  Get this,  a supervisor actually scheduled us on a holiday Monday the 15th to be exact which was Washington's Birthday and the VA was closed   No one takes responsibility for the screw ups either at least own up to the mistake and make it better the next time.  It's always oh I don't know who scheduled you but it wasn't me blah blah blah   For 91years old his in good shape & loves the VA so we'll keep on coming and keep on hoping we have the correct date & time

I'm going to keep this one short & sweet kinda like myself    I took my little Grandpa here after his VA appointment, he's an authentic food type of man he's 92 years young & has quite a sophisticated palate.    So on the outside the place looks scary,  on the inside the place looks scary  I've read many reviews about Carolinas & decided it was the perfect day for a burrito.    The parking lot is very small lucky me I had my grandpa with me & used his special parking privilege.  I wheel him in & he picks the chorizo and egg burrito right away! He tried to get me to pick the same as him but the Machaca with egg was calling my name.    The line was very long but it moved quickly I was surprised to see such a wide-range of customers from police officers, construction workers and men in professional suits.  I knew we were in for a treat.    The tortilla was thin, warm and fresh it was pretty big, but grandpa almost ate the whole burrito he must have been real hungry.  He said it reminded  him of his mothers tortillas that she use to make   and these were the best he's ever had from a restaurant!! What a compliment !! He actually said it was beautiful !! WTF grandpa beautiful ?? Was he taking to his burrito or me,  funny I didn't know a burrito could be beautiful and I thought he was giving me a compliment JK.    My Machaca & egg was delicious ! The meat was tender and juicy.  I don't really eat bread so I can't comment on the tortilla but I'll take grandpas word for it.   Not really liking that the hot sauce is in a ketchup container but that's ok we got some to go & it was yummy !!   It's not fancy & not in a great neighborhood,  but if your in the area and are in the mood for authentic Mexican food I'd say give it a try.    Enjoy

1st time customer & not impressed, They lost two brand-new Nordstrom shirts they didn't even bother to call me and let me know because they had my phone number wrong,  the clerk was not courteous and seemed as though he could care less I didn't get a call from the manager until two days later where I was told it could take up to one week to locate. I was told this rarely happens I had to call them to follow Stephanie the manager said she didn't call me back because her system was down   They cut a check for $120 and again told me this rarely happens, I'll take me business elsewhere

Canoe Appetizer for Two Thai Peanut Chicken Satay, Vegetable Spring Roll, Szechuan Ribs Spicy Tuna Roll, Kim Chee & Shrimp  Very tasty with a nice variety, plenty of food for two  I'm disappointed in the spicy fried rice it tasted very dry & no flavor   The spicy tuna rolls were Devine ! Lots of flavor & very fresh   The spare ribs were tender & fell off the bone   I'll be back for another dessert ah the chocolate soufflé was awesome

So unsatisfied the meat was so under cooked and the service was not good, my food was cold and the hummus dry.  It's never good when you leave a restaurant still hungry.  The rice was not fresh &  I was  so thirsty because my waitress forgot about me.  Overall 2 thumbs down

Go to spot for authentic Middle Eastern eats, this place never ever disappoints!!!  It's very very casual and perfect for a quick lunch.    They've been here for about 30+ years I believe since 1981 !! That's awesome !! I remember this place when I was a kid.  My grandfather lives 2 minutes from here, so anytime I visit & I'm in the mood for some bomb ass food this is where I come.    It's 1/2 cafe & 1/2 market.  You immediately smell deliciousness when you walk in!  all the staff are friendly and more than willing to help out with suggestions on the dishes!!   You can totally tell that all the ingredients are of high quality & very fresh !! The hummus is amazing with the perfect texture and balance of acidity ( not to much lemon ) they sure do give you plenty. It comes with a pickle on top and one olive.   Sandwiches range from $3.49-$5.99   Plates come with Basmati rice & salad, they range from $7.99-9.99  The only thing that could be better about this place is the napkins & plastic ware.  The napkins are the so flimsy it rips so easily even with gentle use.  But its all good !! just use double the napkins and you'll be ok.    Scale of 1-10 this place is a solid 9   ENJOY FELLOW YELPERS

Oh Pho how delicious you are especially on a cloudy rainy cold day   Saigon Nites had pleasant customer service and a decent crowd for dinner.  I was grabbing PHO for take out, since the weather called for it.  The broth was delicious it was salty but not overpowering, a bit on the sweet side but that's ok a little lime, jalapeños, cilantro & a little more lime helped to balance it out   The prices are just right & the amount of food you get is enough for leftovers   Now I have 2 places to choose from

Love this place it's so much fun! I'm guessing they have over 200+ games to choose from.  Always have weekday specials & you get the inside scoop when you sign up for their emails.  The first time you  sign up for their emails you'll get $10 on your next visit ! Which is pretty cool.    Taco Tuesday's are delicious & fun $2 tacos chicken or beef  $2 corona & corona light   The tacos are actually really yummy ! Who would have thought !   I enjoy being my boys here because mom can play too & maybe if in the mood have an adult snow cone or their signature purple people eater which is layered with Stoli Ohranj, HYPNOTIQ, island pucker & cranberry juice !! Yum   Remember to bring your play card to load chips on if not it'll cost you an extra $2   Wednesday's are half price bowling & 1/2 price games  Enjoy gaming fellow YELPERS

This place is so Delicious ! I found it while driving in the shopping plaza & boy am I glad that I did.  There are many places that offer the same dishes but in comparison I won't say names because I don't think that's fair to do, Pars is top notch in quality & quantity.   Customer service is a 10   Food is a 10   Prices are a bit higher than most so I'll give it a 6  but it's the location & the quality of the meat so they get a pass.    Full bar 10   Always clean & always get the to go order correct   I believe my lunch special was $12.50 at dinner time the same plate jumps to $20   Appetizers range from $6.50 - $14  I'll keep coming back for the freshness & deliciousness   Keep up the good work Pars & fellow YELPERS give em a taste

Not the best service everyone seems to be grumpy but that being said, I will still continue to eat here because it's that good.  I'd rather place an order for pick up because the vibe in there is just grumps working.    Amazing chicken & papaya salad is perfect light & refreshing

Totally satisfied my sweet tooth craving!  Not crowed & very clean, no restrooms which was disappointing because your hands can get a little sticky from the samples even if you're being very careful   The Cookie Monster flavor is the  bomb.com !! The White boy Vanilla is very flavorful ! more so than other vanillas in my opinion.  Gotta be at least 30-40 toppings including 2 different coconuts & a few different chocolate chips   They have a small seating area with a few games, we played memory just for the heck of it !    The orange was D'Lish super fruity & refreshing.    Enjoy fellow Yelpers :)

Giddy up folks ! Wether your a beginner, intermediate or experienced they'll have the perfect horse for you !  We celebrated my Birthday with a sunset trail ride followed by a cowboy cookout.  In our group we had a mix of riders, I've personally have some riding experience but it was my son's first time as was my stepdads.  My man, mama, and friends all have experience as well.  They pair you with a horse based on your experience.   My horses name was Mel, and a sweet Gental fellow was he !!  We all had a fantastic time ! Our trail guides were great, a husband & wife team that provided exceptional customer service, they kept us entertained by telling us history about the ranch which by they way has been here for 70yrs!  They had a great sense of humor too. Told us some jokes & asked if we wanted a video or pics taken on my phone so I didn't have to worry about the perfect selfie, they pointed out the wildlife and made sure we got to see an owl that was chilling with its baby owlets.  It was a hoot see a real owl just hanging out in its natural habitat.  So you have a few options for food  1. Have it catered by Macdonalds Ranch.  Prices runs about $65-$95 per person depending on the meat, Chicken, pork or steak.  You can add a bartender (Saloon) to your package but your only allowed 2 drink tickets.    :(   Option 2.   Bring your own food they have grills so you can cook your own grub, we did a hybrid grilled some burgers and picked up catered food from TOM's THUMB  so yum !  You get 3 hrs for the sunset trail 5:30pm-8:30pm We got hooked up and were able to stay till 10:30pm!!!  The manager was fantastic   Options to add on entertainment range in prices anywhere from inexpensive to very expensive. We chose roping with a cowboy & we each had a turn to rope a fake bull.   They light a bonfire fire for you so be sure to bring a SMORES kit! You won't regret it.   Nice & private we had a large corral all to ourselves.   Excellent customer service especially from Katie who helped us coordinate everything! She was professional & emails back right away   So all in all it was the best Birthday Party I ever had hands down ! THANK YOU MACDONALDS and staff for making it so memorable.  On a scale from 1-10 it was totally a 10

I had the most pleasant experience meeting Pavel Gershkovich, C.H.P., C.R.P., P.M.P., he's the President of the Salt Chalet Arizona, Since getting back from 42 degree weather in Pittsburg & flying with lots of sneezing & coughing ppl  I developed a bit of laryngitis & wheezing.    My Dr. Was out of the office so I couldn't get in to be seen, bummer but everything happens for a reason So while browsing Good ol Groupon I seen the Salt room & read the following on their website sounded interesting and I'll try anything once   halotherapy - uses aerosoled salt. The size of the particles is the same as in natural salt caves. When breathed in, these particles penetrate deep into the bronchial tree where the antiseptic properties of the salt can work on mucus and infections. People can experience improvement of bronchial drainage, that is, bronchial tube cleansing.  salt room was developed, a room where the walls and floor are covered with salt and a halogenerator blows crushed salt particles into the room providing all the health benefits that a natural salt cave would.  Well even better my little guy who is 8 has had a lingering cough & they said it's safe and perfect for children ! I was excited to hear this & so was he   I guess children respond faster than adults do and let me tell you he did not cough all night !! and when we walked out of there we felt 60% better   I'm not wheezing & starting to feel better this place rocks ! Give them a try   The staff was friendly, clean waiting room, short wait what more can you ask for.  Oh and the have an apothecary shop if your into that sort of thing

This place rocks ! I always feel so fresh & pretty when I walk out the door, like I'm ready for anything .  The shampoo and conditioner are luxurious and smell amazing  The staff are very sweet and most of the time will ask if you'd like a beverage, a wash and go Blow is only $35 bucks add a hot tool like a curling iron and its $10 extra they usually tell you so you're not surprised   The only bad experience I had was when I had my makeup done and it was not worth the $ my eye make up was not what I asked for way to dark for daytime and my eyelashes were coming loose   So I'll stick to my blow outs and keep the makeup applications at the Mac store

This is the 3nd time we've been & we'll deff be back ! My son. & I have such a fun day I was a good sport and joined him, this place is cool for a few reasons   1. It makes him super tired  2. It makes him real happy & lots of other kids to play with  3. Massage chairs are actually worth the $ and time ahhh I played on my phone & got a quick rub down.  It was the bomb.com

Wow no wonder this place is hoppin! The salad options are incredible. Seriously some of the best ranch I've ever had.  I ordered a 1/2 chicken chop salad & full California sandwich came out to $9 with a drink not bad considering you usually pay that price for 1/2 salad 1/2 which elsewhere.  The full salads are huge!  They have a nice selection of hot sauce and free Italian soda mix ins no sugar free ones but a nice touch.    Customer service was great everyone was real friendly & prompt,  very clean & modern inside

Cinco de mayo was a dud ! Not impressed at all I've been here a total of 3 times and now it's time to do a legit review.    The wait was extra extra long because of the festivities I suppose.    They ask for your phone number so they can txt you when the table is ready well I never received a message so I had to keep checking in with them so much for that technology service!   The hostess was a doll through it all !! and had a smile on her face the whole time.  The music totally sucked for Cinco de Mayo festivities, all I heard was whack music from the 80's and 90's shit my mom used to listen to even the manager said he didn't know what was up with that.  Even still my little son tipped the musician.   THE FOOD:   Ba Ba Ba Boring !   Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but just keeping it 100% real on my Personal experience.    Taco Vampario   Double tortilla with melted cheese, serrano chiles & scallions, carne asada, guacamole & pico de gallo topped with cotixa , chipotle aioli & cilantro.   The meat was cold and very red I couldn't eat it.   FISH TACO 'GOBERNADOR' wild-caught fish, pan-roasted with lemon & garlic, on a taco dorado with cheese, salsa gobernador, avocado, onion & cilantro, pico & lettuce  The fish taco was delicious very fresh w/ just the right amount of citrus,  IF I ever go back this is what I'd order.    Sol has nice atmosphere but it was a rather insipid plate of tacos! and run-of-the-mill beans and rice that left a boring taste in my mouth.

We really enjoy this neighborhood gem  It's patio dining area are really quite something, this is what AZ is all about the beautiful scenery and perfect weather this time of year I can't say that during the summer heat !   The hostess was sweet & prompt  We like that !! The music was light rock & just the perfect volume  Plenty of seating although we us to wait a good 15 min but that was ok as we enjoyed a drink & the scenery  The food is very yummy I always get their salads which are fresh, just the right size and full of flavor, I'm a ranch fan and they have a buttermilk which is a solid 8  The Italian vinaigrette is my second choice which is also an 8.  Prices are reasonable all kids meals are $6 and salads range from $9-$15  We will keep coming back for the deliciousness

Oh my goodness did we enjoy ourselves or what, being that it was Valentine's Day it was very busy lots of children & adults alike.  The price is reasonable $19.95 for adults & $12.95 for children  Pros & cons   Con :  long lines Lines can be long!!! I got a bit anxious because I couldn't wait to see the butterflies, they recommend you see a 3D 15 min movie about the life of the monarch butterfly I didn't want to but so glad we did !!! Best 3D I've ever seen so cool and realistic.   Con : very humid in the atrium, ladies if you go expect the hair to go flat in 0 to 20 seconds so use a high humidity hair spray.   Con : parking overflow !!!  Pros : Butterflies butterflies butterflies everywhere? They land on you and just hang out like little buddies, it's a ticklish feeling.  They can touch you but you can't touch them.    Pros : amazing photos everywhere you turn   Pros : clean restrooms, friendly staff overall fun experience   It's fun for all ages if you've never been you should totally go   Enjoy the butterfly kisses that they give you   anyone desires a wish to come true they must first capture a butterfly and whisper their wish to it. Since a butterfly can make no sound, the butterfly can not reveal the wish to anyone but the Great Spirit who hears and sees all.  In gratitude for giving the beautiful butterfly its freedom, the Great Spirit always grants the wish. So, according to legend, by making a wish and giving the butterfly its freedom, the wish will be taken to the heavens and be granted.

Wow this was such a delicious lunch ! So tasty and satisfying we will certainly be back My kids really enjoyed it too!  The prices were very reasonable, 1 regular gyro, 1 chicken gyro with a side Greek salad, 2 medium drinks & falafel for $22 that's a deal   The freshness was a 7  The meat in the gyros was nice and juicy and piping hot  My salad was a little limp but non the less tasty.   It was very clean, enough seating and soft Greek music playing which was a nice touch   The staff was real friendly   We will be back !

Stopped here for a quick sweet treat & overall I'll give this place a 6.  It's just not that great tasting, MoJo & Yogurt land are the tastiest in my opinion.  But the staff as great & the coffee was really delicious they have crushed ice & strong coffee.  Next time I'm coming back for drinks

So far I can say I'm a happy customer just knowing I'm doing something good for myself & investing in my body makes me feel good & hopefully when all is said and done I'll look better too.   Summer is around the corner & the Zerona treatments will give me that little boost I need.  There's no guarantees in life with anything so why not give it a try.  I've done laser treatments before & they DO work but that being said you have to put in the work too!  Lots of water & exercise which Is recommend after a treatment.    The staff are all very nice they DO however try to sell you other services but are not overly pushy.  They have a flexible schedule which is convenient & lucky for me I live a few minutes away.   After 1 treatment I see a small change,  it maybe to soon to tell or maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me but anywho even if it's a small change I'll take it.    3 treatments $85 that's a deal   Happiness is Priceless

D'Lish !!  And totally fresh !  It's more than a breakfast Joynt.   This place rocks for lunch I tried the Chicken avocado club turned into a salad the chicken was very lean , cooked perfectly and juicy.  I'm a ranch fanatic so was kinda disappointed when I tried it :( not authentic at all tasted like a little dipping sauce from a fast food joint.    The ambience was delightful very cozy I will most def be back

Wow this is the best chicken broth I've ever had ! Seriously I don't know how they do it It's magical.  I took my little 92 year old grandpa and all he could say was wow this is delicious so fresh & beautiful.    The lunch bowl was pretty large we couldn't finish it, they will charge you for extra broth but it's worth every dime.    The broccoli was fresh and defiantly al dente  I can't stand when veggies are limp and loose color that indicates to me that they at are over cooked.   The bathroom was clean and Nicely decorated.    We tried the banana fritters which were very tasty ! Crunchy on the outside rolled in a light sugar nice warm and fluffy on the inside filled with fragrant banana  Five little balls come in a serving  I live kind of far from there but I will most certainly be back

The Fiesta Bowl was the bomb ! I turned it into a salad :) it was so fresh with generous amounts of fresh avacado, the lime ranch was perfect I'm a total ranch fan so I was impressed    If you like it spicy them ask for a little squirt of the Chipotle habanero sauce ! It's so dam good!!  but very spicy like a donkey punch!    The staff were really friendly but didn't know the nutritional content of the smoothies.  They couldn't tell me how many carbs were in the smoothies so that was a turn off because they all sound so freaking  D-lish.  I decided to order the blue sunset so my son could enjoy it he's 6 and was like wow mom this is a yummy treat can we come back.  He also had a cheese quesadilla which was really good according to him as he ate the whole thing.  It was oozing of fresh cheese 4 slices total   The portions are generous the staff is cool and the atmosphere is chill we will absolutely be back I just wish I knew how many Carbs are in the smoothies especially the cocoa nut umm almond awe sound good too !

This place is Good for a light dinner and cocktails,  They do NOT have a kids menu but a few good options for the little ones are the Mac N Cheese my 7yr old son rated it a 6-7 the cheese burger is a good option as well.  I ordered a few oysters $3 each so why not right they were D lish !  my son had a Shirley temple which he did not care for I guess they make their own grenadine in house but he wasn't impressed and honestly neither was I, it was sour not sweet had an orange flavor rather than a cherry flavor.    We ordered a Cheese burger with side salad, OMG the Ranch is the Bomb.com!! they make it fresh daily.  I'm a huge ranch fan!   I'll give it a 9   it was plenty of food for one adult and child we will totally be back he did feel like a big boy because they didn't have crayons so if you have small kids be prepared to keep them entertained

For the past three days I've been very happy to wake up a little early just to get my annihilator.  The lines are long but I'm happy to wait my turn.  Dutch bros is TOP NOTCH  they start with double-shots, even in the small drinks!  They use a proprietary blend of Colombian, Brazilian and El Salvadoran beans.  Cray cray ! Double shots even in small drinks no wonder I love this ish.    The employees are genuinely friendly and they all seem to be jacked up on caffeine   Cuz they're always hyper.  Starbucks is so plain & boring both their coffee and employees  so if you happen to be a BUCKY give Dutch Bros a try you might just switch over & join the Dutch Mafia  The stamp loyalty card is cool, after the 10th stamp you get a free drink   Thank you Dutch Bros for making me happy and hyper

Love love love this place!! Customer service is top notch from start to finish.  It's always so clean and fresh in here.  The massage chairs are fabulous with lots of options to choose from.    I recommend making an appointment as they get pretty busy.  It may be a bit pricey but it's 100% worth it! After all you get what you pay for, and if you want high quality then this is the perfect nail shop !!!  nice nails ain't cheap and cheap nails ain't nice.    The owner Tracey is a doll, she's often there checking customers in & filling drinks.  She's such a nice person you can tell its genuine.   1 drink is included with your service, so if you get a pedicure & a manicure that's 2 drinks.    Delicious options Red wine, white wine, champagne,  red sangria, white sangria, coffee, soda's, water, oh and a variety of beer.   I've never had a bad experience there & all the ladies that work there are awesome!!   Inner beauty is great but a little Shellac never hurt   Enjoy pampering yourselves xoxo

Every time I come here I'm never disappointed.  The service is great the food is fresh I don't have to wait long.  It's like an organic healthy version of subway but way better.  The price is worth every penny seriously! The salad is big enough for lunch & dinner.  Give em a try it's totally worth it  The ranch was not to my liking but that's ok I substituted it for a spicy coconut vinaigrette which was lip smacking amazing.

Ok so I waited 1 day before writing the review because I wanted to be fair and not be in a grumpy mood from the terrible service I received.    My first time trying Firehouse subs   The service my little son and I received was very unwelcoming and unpleasant, the only reason I stayed was because my son was hungry for a yummy sandwich and was excited to see the firehouse theme, Otherwise I would have left and went elsewhere.    I walk in and at least 4 staff are behind the counter, not one single person greeted us you would think they'd be a bit more enthusiastic being its was grand opening, no one explained the menu options and when I asked about which hot sauce the recommended they said they didn't know because they don't eat that. So I tried 3 different ones the Iguana Gold was delicious but pretty spicy so have a drink handy.     The cashier was the only one with a smile on her face, she was new so wasn't familiar with the menu yet, I had a few questions about the dressing and items on the salad   I picked the Italian grilled chicken with peppercorn Ranch I'll rate it a good 4 since the lettuce had brown pieces and the chicken was so tiny and didn't taste fresh. I'm not a super picky person and know a fresh salad when I see and taste one.  It was a decent size for the price though.  My son had the kids turkey with provolone & added bacon, he rated it a 7-8 and I'll give it the same.  The turkey was very good ! Fresh slices just right, nice portion size, the bacon was nice and crispy a little thin but that's ok  The bread seemed fresh, he ate the whole thing.  He was real happy that they gave him a plastic fireman's hat and a rice Krispy treat  The soda machine is awesome ! It's one of those electronic pick your own mix kind   The plastic ware was a nice touch it looked like real silverware, tons of hot sauce bottles, looked like there were over 10 kinds.  Salt and pepper packets no shakers.    They locked us in & we couldn't get out ugh as if the visit wasn't already upsetting now my kid was scared and they didn't even say sorry  I'm just disappointed in the poor service and unfriendly staff, treat people as you would want your grandparents  to be treated.  Even my son commented that no one smiled   I'll don't think they wanted my business so why should I go back, it's a shame because I was so excited to try it   There are plenty of good food places in the area like modern margarita, yard house, mellow mushroom, heck even sprouts has ffriendlier staff working for them.

Wow did I sleep like a baby  I had a fabulous treatment, the detox was kinda gross to look at but made me feel better knowing I got rid of some toxins maybe it's all the Vino  I've been having.  No but really it was an awesome quiet clean relaxing place   We were greeted right away and they treated my little guy 8yrs old like a little man ! Very nice people there.    I had a groupon & they had no problem with it at all idk what other ppl are talking about ! I got my full time and attention, it all depends on how you treat people I guess.    My son had a 30 min foot rub & loved it, he fell asleep  and is already asking to go back    Thank you Tim you were wonderful we will be back

Hola, Bonjour,  Néih Hóu, sà-wàt-dee, Chào anh  Ok so you get the point, you will no longer require MASCARA . I feel like it's almost every females basic daily beauty product, I don't leave the house without it  !   First Set of Lashes Only $79.99  (Regular price $250)  They have four eyelash styles to choose from!   Cute  Natural  Sexy  Gorgeous  I like my lashes full & gorgeous so that's the style I picked.  The names of the styles to choose from are true to how they sound, cute are just that "cute" and so on   I've had my eyelashes done before elsewhere and had a terrible experience so I was very nervous coming here.  But all my anxiety & fear went out the window when I met "Colby" she was knowledgeable, professional, kind, gentle and friendly.  I love nice people !!   I had been to the Tatum & shea location 3weeks prior.  The lashes lasted 3 weeks until I needed a touch up & I was very happy with them.  The only reason I went to the Tatum location was because Frank Loyd Wright was full.  Most the ladies at the other location were nice as well.    The waiting room is lovely, very clean, natural suns light & open.  I wish they'd offer beverages but oh well,  the technician brings you back to a private room & asks if you've had them done before & asks if you have any makeup on, if so you have to remove everything!  She goes over styles including length & fullness.    They offer a blanket & have you lay down with a comfy round pillow that goes under your feet, they make sure your comfortable.   I totally fell asleep with my headphones in.  They do have soft spa like music playing which was a nice touch.     She proceeded to put cool soft pads under my eyes & tape on the top of the lid.  She brushes the natural lashes & gets right to work.   Be prepared to spend 2 hours on your first visit About 1 hr each eye.  On refills it's about 30min each eye    They use pharmaceutical  grade adhesive that you must not get wet for 24-48 hrs and when you do start your make up again when removing make sure you use a water based remover otherwise oil based with dissolve the glue & you'll be shedding lashes.    The process is very gentle, no burning from the adhesive since it never comes in contact with your skin. Synthetic eyelashes are placed about 1mm away from your skin.  They offer a membership & it's totally worth it if you are committed to your lashes here's the Dow low    the first application is $79.99 instead of $250 Thereafter refills are $45.99 they charge you every month and have you sign a contract it's for 12months which kinda sucks but if your going to keep up with them then it's cool.  The only way to cancel it is a note from your Doctor or if you move more than 30 miles away from the nearest lash studio.    If you do not use your lash refill in that month then IT DOES roll over which is nice.  You get 10%off all products that they sell.  Beware of the cancellation policy, no show or same day cancellations will be charged 50% of the scheduled price.  So if you must cancel do so at least 24 hrs in advance.    They also have a refer a friend program if you give your friends name for example Melissa Gordoa they will look it up in the system & you get their member discount on all services & discount rate on all products which is kinda cool   I'm not digging the long ass membership agreement that I had to read but I'm committed now so here we go.  So far I love them  and I hope you give them a try too!! You'll feel FabuLASH    5 stars for cleanliness,professionalism, quality of service & the fuzzy blanket they cover you up with.

I'm all about that Base bout that Base Pizzeria that is..... I first seen this quaint establishment on Instagram,  I follow Brie Bella & Daniel Bryan from WWE.  They're locals from Scottsdale AZ and they know all the local great farm to table eateries!  So I knew this was gonna be the bomb.com!!   Top 5 reasons to give them a try   1.  Phenomenal customer service very personable and genuinely friendly to my son & myself.     2. They use as much local & organic ingredients as possible.  Farm to table is totally in ! They even have an awesome custom dining table that was made in AZ.  They carry Local wines & the EVOO they have is infused with LOCAL hot peppers as well.    3. They make the dressings & pizza sauce from scratch !   4. Cleanliness was superb, both dining area & restrooms.    5.  Pizza & Salad was delicious ! Two thumbs up The pizza was fresh made to order & the aroma was enticing !  Watching it go in the coal burning oven is mouthwatering.   I ordered the crispy prosciutto salad, it was loaded with arugula, crispy prosciutto, goat cheese & avocado it was delicious !! Very fresh and filling, enough for two ! I had most definitely had enough for lunch the next day !   The pizza we ordered was half cheese half pepperoni, just the right size !! Not to big not to small just right!!!  I believe 6 slices total. The pepperoni was big & fresh.  The texture was soft and not to chewy. It's free from preservatives so has a distinctively different taste & texture than run of the mill Pizza's.  I loved it & so did my little so , we gotta give it a solid 8!! it would have rated it a 10 but it was a tad on the soggy side. However It was bursting with such fabulous flavor that I didn't mind, maybe a little longer in the oven to get that crunch and less sogginess.  So next time I'll just ask for a little extra cook time.    Overall they rock !!! I'll totally be back & rave about them to anyone looking for a good pie in the area   Enjoy !!!

Very cool shop that offers henna & eyebrow threading.    Threading is an ancient method of hair removal  and it really is the most effective method of shaping beautiful eyebrows and removing unwanted facial hair. Unlike other hair removal techniques there is no burning, peeling or chemicals that irritate the skin. Threading is the most precise hair removal method to date and the hair even grows back thinner and slower!  My mother told me about threading a long time ago but I still like to get my brows waxed   I do like the fact that the hair grows back slower and unlike tweezing where single hairs are pulled out one at a time, threading can remove short lines of hair.  Only $10 and they take walk in's   Loyalty program = 1 stamp per service for every 5 you get a free $20 henna service or free brow threading   Ladies were very professional & friendly !   If you've never tried it before give it a go it's not as painful as waxing   The shop does have a very strong scent like hippies that was my least favorite part of the experience   Enjoy !!

I contacted them on FB since I was not able to find their new Scottsdale number & they just got a yelp account as of yesterday.

They do coffee like a Boss !  This place rocks my coffee socks off, from the moment you walk in, you're in for a treat!!  The decor here is very contemporary, modern, and sleek, fast Wi-Fi with an assortment of IPhone & Android chargers built into the table top, incredible views of the McDowell Mountains & comfortable seating on the patio.  What a perfect place to sip your coffee & enjoy the majestic views.    Oh boy do I love Lattes, and cold brew coffee ! And OMG does this place hit the nail on the head !!  Everything I've had so far was the BOMB.com!!    My Latte was a custom Sugar free hazelnut / vanilla 10 oz with the perfect amount of froth ! Dang the nuttiness of the coffee was so intense it that it made my taste buds dance.    I liked the fact that they have cold brew coffee on Tap and growlers to go.  I hear that they're  in the works of getting a liquor license, so in the future they will have Wine & beer. I'm not sure I'd enjoy a coffee infused with liquor as I drink it for the caffeine rush and adding liquor to it might just ruin that effect.  But I'll try anything once.    The bathrooms were nicely done & have always been clean !  The baked goods look temping but they aren't made in house bummer.    They have a drive through if you're in a hurry but if you have the time I recommended going inside & taking a peek at the patio the views are just majestic.  I'm lucky to live in the neighborhood, so Boss coffee is a gem to me.    I have my favorites but I won't compare.  Boss coffee is now in my top 3 shops that I prefer!!  way to go and thank you for my caffeine rush when I visit you guys.    The customer service is good the girls are friendly & they are still learning the Latte Art! I let them practice on mine because practice makes perfect right.      Thank you again and may you're business flourish   Enjoy coffee lovers

Delighted to have this Postino's in the neighborhood!! I know that when we go to any Postino's it's going to be a fun, relaxed, delicious wine kinda time.  And that's exactly what the Kierland location delivered!!   I feel as though it had good energy & good vibes! from the moment we walked in the hostess was warm & friendly.  As soon as we were seated a server named Monika came over and was more than happy to help me pick a glass of wine.    I was able to Sample a few that she recommended Couroulu  $11 Syrah-Merlot | 2012 | France   Alba  $10 Cabernet Sauvignon | 2013 | Chile  Biutiful  $10 Sparkling Rose | NV | Spain I HAD TO TRY THIS JUST BECAUSE OF THE NAME.  And I'm glad I did ! It was so delicious   I ended up picking the Alba Cabernet very smooth and paired well with my meal which was the Butchers block.   Butcher's Block  $14.50 An assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with asparagus, hummus, olives, nuts and crosti  Their food is constantly good ! Never had a bad experience at any of the locations. Kierland was no exception.  Everything was top notch!!   Their artisan meats & cheeses are of high quality   and so is the customer service.    Ryan & Monica were fantastic.  They made sure our glasses were not running low & our food was to our liking.    The lighting is very dim to set a nice tone and the music was light & hip.  Very reasonable prices on all items ranging from $6.75 -$14.50.    kids meals are only $5 !!   Happy hour $5 glasses and pitchers of beer from open till 5pm  We will most definitely be back & we wish them the best !!    Cheers & enjoy !!
