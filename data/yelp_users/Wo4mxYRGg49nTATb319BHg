I would put NO STARS or negative 5 stars if I could!  People here are RUDE!!  Called to inquire about a grill and was on hold for a while, not the problem, when a lady finally answered the call, I told her I was calling to see if they have a certain product I was looking for... Her response..., "what?, I don't know?  Hold on."  Then she hung up on me!  I called back, to try it again, a man answers, said, "ummm, hold on."  Then hung up on me again!  So, nevermind, will look elsewhere!

Pretty disappointed at this place the girl who was working there was pretty rude and has lots of attitude, her name was Brie I believe.  Was NOT helpful at all...not a friendly face, lots of attitude!!  I think she realized how rude she was at the end of my visit so she managed to fake a smile and say have a good day.  But I left without buying because she was just rude!  I would put negative stars but there's no such option.

Always my go to Verizon store.  Even though we waited a while, it was worth it because we waited for a specific sales consultant whom I always work with, Michelle J.  She went above and beyond to assist my son and I with connecting our new phones.  She even stayed longer than she was supposed to just so we were able to leave the store happy and satisfied!  The store staff were friendly, but Michelle was awesome! I go there because of her and her superb customer service!!
