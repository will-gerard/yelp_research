Had a great breakfast this morning and as usual the service was fantastic! Amanda was courteous and very friendly! Highly suggest grabbing a bite to eat here.

I was looking for a new nail salon and thanks to reviews, tried this gem out. Very clean and super friendly staff. Mandy was my nail tech and I will definitely be going back!

I'm a 'newer' vegan and have really missed the treats and desserts I used to indulge in. My husband and I had lunch here about a week ago and I decided to try the vegan vanilla cheesecake.... It was AMAZING and my non-vegan husband actually prefers it over real cheesecake!!! Definitely recommend this place!

I can't say enough great things about Dr. K and his staff! I've been taking our animals to him for 1.5 years and he has always treated them with the utmost attention and care. One of our kitties had a serious heart problem and was visiting Dr. K up to 3 times a week. At least twice a week and on the weekends Dr. K would call and check up on Mister to see how he was doing. I've been to my fair share of vets and Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital is by far the best I've been to! Highly recommended!!!

I ordered a sub-in-a-tub Mike's Way. It comes with full slices of tomato, onion and all he lunch meat. When I asked for a knife, the staff behind the counter said they don't have knives. What?!? I really enjoyed sitting at the table watching the rest of my group eat.. Thanks, Jersey Mike's! 2-stars only given because I like the food. Experience was not so good...

Was in the process of ordering a large Bianca pizza. The menu on Yelp shows $15. The gentleman I was speaking to said the same pizza would be $23+. I told him the price on Yelp was much lower and he said that the menu on Yelp had not been updated.... Very bait & switch feeling so I cancelled my order. Really a bummer because I was looking for a new place.
