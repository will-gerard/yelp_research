I'd have to say TTY has been a good experience. The instructors have been super helpful. They do what they can to motivate you to keep coming to class and keep going. I read the previous review, and I disagree. I came here on my own free will and was not pressured to start. I passed my A+ and Network+ with their help and have been working on my CCNA.  A lot of people here have told me this place has helped them too. I remember when I first showed up and got right to work. They provided me all the tools that I needed to get moving. If you want to speak to someone there, ask to speak to Hiro (instructor) or Gabe (instructor), they both have real life experience in the IT industry. Both can walk you through understanding anything you need.

Worst business ever award. They never answer the phone. Their.customer service is terrible. The store is disorganized and looks like black Friday is everyday. Go somewhere else if you can.

Very terrible service. People have screwed up EVERY order i've made. Three times they've handed me a drink that opened and spilled all over my door in the drive thru after I've asked them to make sure it was secure. Once I waited for 25 minutes for 10 cheese burgers I was taking to a group of people who were helping me at an event.  I've asked them specifically not to put things on my food and still they do. I told the girl I was deathly allergic to pickles (not true, but told her this so to make sure they were not on the burger) and yet my burger still had pickles.  Luckily this McD's has made me not want fast food anymore. If I go to McD's I get a parfeit or oatmeal.

I was referred by a friend. Probably the best recommendation I've gotten for Vegas.  The place is awesome. It's all booths. All the staff is constantly moving.   The food is beyond delicious. I got the biscuits and gravy. The best I've ever had. I couldn't stop eating.  I didn't need to add anything to it. Flavor was perfect. The biscuits were perfectly soft  The staff came back many times even though they were super busy. I will definitely be coming back on this trip and every trip in the future.   The wait wasn't bad, 15 minutes, honestly I'd wait as long as it took. Worth the wait for sure. They have slots and a lounge that you can hang out in until they call you.

My first visit was terrible, my second visit was terrible. Then I found certain people in the store. I have a person in each department, and Teresa who I joke is my personal shopper. Mainly because she is so helpful. She knows where everything is and is more than willing to show you different opens.  Here is my list: Teresa - Always my first point of contact to find what I need if I don't know where it is. Alex - Lumber. I have been building a lot out of wood at my store because it's cheap, but he has really helped me choose the right materials and look at my plans to make sure everything is there. I didn't like building anything until it became easy. Manny - Paint. know where everything is and is beyond helpful. Todd - I don't kow where this guy works, but he always seems to be around when I need help. Dom (?) - Helped me in electrical and plumbing. I got back and had everything I needed.  There are some more but I can't remember right now.

Not the best, not horrible. Waitress not being able to make a recommendation or knowing what anything is, pretty lame. This place is very overrated.

I've tried sushi from all over Arizona and this is my favorite place. Most places either teppanyaki or sushi are good but everything here is perfection. The staff is welcoming and helpful in recommendations. I found my favorite roll is the Jamie roll extra spicy and tonight I'm trying the house roll extra spicy. We came here for my birthday to experience the teppanyaki since we have come so many times for sushi and I love the people here. Joe is who I would recommend for this but I am seeing everyone is good. Joe is very entertaining and my daughter loves him and his antics. This place doesn't have a bad thing about it. We come at least once a week.

Was looking forward to a place that specializes in burgers, this is my it. There was less than 20 people there and it took 45 minutes to get fried burgers. They asked us how we wanted our burger. We ordered medium, they all came out over cooked, dry and not even warm. The waitress wasnt very helpful. I'm pretty open to place, but I doubt I will give this one another try. The manager was nice and apologetic.  This is also "ourgang saloon and grill", they don't own a grill.

Yelp you failed me.  I went here because I really wanted breakfast and we went with a place with higher star rating and 100+ reviews.  First we walked in, the place was pretty nice.  We stood at the front for at least 10 minutes before any employee acknowledged us. We got a table and were seated. The person who sat us seemed to be grumpy having a bad day. They didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  We got our drinks, the person spilled the orange juice and looked at us like it was our fault. We had to ask if we could order. Once we ordered, we got no acknowledgement until I asked for a refill.  I asked how long our food would take at about 40 minutes of waiting. I was snapped at because they had too many orders from the bar. This should not be our problem. We didn't go to the bar next door. It took about 50 minutes to get our food. I was really looking forward to it. The bacon crumbled every time I bit into it. Not really what I like. I can go on and one about what I didn't like. The sausage was pretty over cooked.  My wife ordered French toast, which was very good.  Overall I felt like I was disturbing everyone's day by asking for anything. I won't be returning here.

I am a regular at Saigon Kitchen. The staff is awesome and the food is probably hands down the best I've ever experienced in a Vietnamese restaurants. The atmosphere is awesome. The place has a great style. I've introduced my family to Saigon Kitchen and my dad looks like he will become a regular as well.   I was a fan of Pho and spring rolls, but this place steps up from the level of food I'm use to. Everything is fresh. I use to eat spring rolls and pho, until the owner encouraged me to try more. I've had many things on the menu and never one bad experience with the food. I sit down, order a iced green tea and let them surprise me. I've got that much trust in the staff.   I will continue to be a regular and recommend others to try it too. Local business need support and this one goes above in beyond to earn loyalty.

I've eaten here over 40 times. I love this place. Every time I go in I'm amazed. The quality of the food is amazing. The owner, Dennis, takes pride in every meal. The employees are very happy to work there and are very welcoming. The Fire Cracker shrimp with garlic noodles is my new favorite plate.

Went in, one other party was there. Their poppers were cold, they said they could heat them up for me. You don't heat popper, they are double the price and half the size of Teharu in Scottsdale.   Surprisingly the iced green tea wasn't very good.

Seriously my favorite place to eat. I don't like too much fast food. I eat here 2-3 days a week. I like being able to mix around the menu items. So far my favorite is souvlaki and prime rib. It's live changing amazing. Two employees keep me coming back. They are super helpful and really nice. I read the reviews about the pricing and I don't know what people are complaining about. Fresh ingredients, good selection, and they aren't greedy on the veggies. This is the only place I can think of that doesn't charge extra for avocado. Amazing. I guess for me, the people make the experience much better. I really like the food and think it is worth it.
