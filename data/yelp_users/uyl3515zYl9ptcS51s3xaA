Loud, but if you're looking for a quiet brewery to eat at then you don't want to go to a brewery at all.  Great atmosphere and mix of people.  The famous "Anthony" of "Anthony's Fish & Chips" even came out to meet my grandmother after the server (who is also phenomenal and my grandparents are regulars because of him) mentioned that she gets that same dish every visit. Fantastic drinks and the food is unreal.  Want to go back ASAP!

Super difficult to get on the phone and apparently you can only transact with them over the phone.  The actual service performed was satisfactory. My frustration was more with the "office managers" who clearly work from home (I could hear children screaming in the background the ONE time I was able to get someone on the phone).  Also apparently they are only available at 8am on Saturdays even weeks in advance.  Literally no other appointment times available any Saturday of the month except for 8am.  I don't know about anyone else, but if I was willing to get up at 8am to let someone in my home I'd probably be motivated enough to save the $$ and clean myself.

Elli did a great job, loved the haircut and shave.  Little more money than I wanted to pay, but my girlfriend was SO happy with the results it paid for itself many times over. Good work isn't cheap and cheap work isn't good! Will come back for sure
