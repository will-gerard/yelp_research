Came here last night with a group of 5 of us last night for some dinner and cocktails, we didn't make a reservation but were able to grab a bar table without a wait.  This place is really nice inside; not what you would expect to find when you realize it's nestled inside of a strip mall.  Our server was actually the bartender and he was impressive, very quick and knowledgeable.  I had a late lunch so I wasn't looking for a large meal so I ordered the soup and salad combination.  The chicken tortilla soup here is to die for!  My friend loved it so much she actually ordered a second helping.  My boyfriend had the ribs and said they were amazing.    It's a bit out of the way for me, but I would certainly like to come back sometime and try out an entree.  Overall I would definitely recommend coming here!

Damn I hate to rate this place this low but they really dropped the ball last night.  I was able to get a last minute reservation at 8pm for our anniversary and that was more than gracious. Friends of mine have been talking about this place for years and I finally got the opportunity to try it out first hand.   When we arrived there was complimentary valet which was awesome.  Never having been here before it took a little asking around to find the downstairs bar where we had our reservation.  The hostess was super nice and helpful and told us our table wasn't ready yet but that the bartenders would know we were waiting.    The stairway down to the bar is fun,  yeah that sounds silly but it's cool. The downstairs bar ambience is sexy to say the least, including a fireplace:)  It's small yet welcoming and very warm.  We took a seat on the couch and one of the bartenders came by to get our drink order and informed us that he knew we were waiting for a table and that he would take care of us all night.  That he did.   We were informed our table would be a little late because the people were still sitting around a bit. No worries, we were all about taking it slow and enjoying ourselves. Once we were sat, our server came by and gave us a very informed, detailed explaination of the specials,  and honestly EVERYTHING sounded amazing.  Granted we usually eat dinner around 7pm and at this point it was around 8:20 ish. We were hungry:)  Orders were placed and wine was enjoyed, and then we waited. A very long time.  Once our food finally came around I was pretty damn unhappy.  Our server himself told us that our ticket time was 50 minutes!  Apparently a 40 top came in and their food was a priority over the few smaller tables.  Almost an hour after ordering we finally got our food and I could definitely tell our food was an afterthought. It tasted good,  not amazing,  and was barely just warm enough.  Couldn't tell if it had been sitting around or was thrown together half assed. Our server did the best he could but not once did a manager come by to apologize for the food issue.   They comp'ed us 2 drinks and gave us a free dessert. I dunno,  I just left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Definitely not an anniversary dinner I feel proud about bringing my husband to. That's frustrating.   Like I said,  ambience/drinks and service were top notch. The kitchen and management really fell through on this tonight. First and probably the last time I'll come here.    What a shame.

I've lived in the valley (tempe) since 2002 and have always heard great things about nello's. It took me 13 years to get there, but I was very pleased. The patio was large and we were seated outside without a wait. We had wine, salad and pizza and all were very good. I will return soon.

Initially I had to wait to be helped,  only saw one worker in the appliance area and he was already helping a customer.  Finally another employee helped me out and I was in and out in less than ten minutes.  Checkout was a breeze and a nice guy helped me load my microwave into my car.

We have dined at this Flemings location numerous times before and had wonderful experiences, however, this time things fell very flat.  Things started off fine with water and a wine list that was provided via Ipad.  My fiance's mother asked the waitress for wine recommendations and she wasn't able to help ( it seemed like she wasn't too familiar with the selection).  Ordering food was fairly quick and easy.  Once we received our steaks, the waitress informed us about the lava cake that takes 20 minutes to cook, and told us she would check back in shortly to see if we were interested.  We didn't see her again for at least 30 minutes.   I know, I know.  When people usually say 30 minutes they are grossly overestimating out of frustration; however, we actually did wait that long.  So long in fact, it began to get awkward at the table.  All the food was consumed and our wine glasses were empty, yet our waitress was nowhere in sight.  When she did finally show, it was too late to order the lava cake.  We instead ordered two plates of creme brulee and two desserts to go, along with a cup of coffee.  The coffee was cold, and it took 10 minutes to get a new hot cup.  Once dessert was finished we again were left waiting around for our waitress; waiting to clear dishes, waiting to receive the check, and again, waiting to pay the check.  In all it took us two hours to have a simple meal, and that was not by choice.    The food was great, per usual, but the service was just downright bad.

Honestly I don't understand how this place has been around so long.  I definitely appreciate a good mom and pops restaurant, and I so badly wanted to love it here.  The patio is gorgeous but for some reason you can't dine out there.  The decor is so incredibly outdated and feels like you should only be there if you're over 60.  The cocktails were nicely poured but the wine was pretty mediocre.  My friend and I shared two dishes, one was the pesto tortellini, which was fabulous, and the other was the beef ravioli.  The ravioli seriously tasted like the pureed meat in chef boyardee from the can.  Just to make sure I wasn't crazy I made everyone at the table taste it, and they all agreed it was not edible.  I did complain and they took it off the bill.  I just can't justify spending my money here because it's so lackluster.    To each their own.

After driving by this place a million times, saying "we still need to go there", finally stopped in.  Boy was I glad I did.  This is a very mom and pops kind of place that you can't help but be behind.  I've read that this place does most of it's business for wedding cakes and specialty cakes, however they do have a case of fresh goodies to choose from a la carte.  This being my first time, I decided to try a few options. I ended up with an individual apple pie/tarte, a chocolate cake with espresso mousse, and a black forest mousse cake.  Honestly they were amazing, and at about $4-$5 it was very affordable.  Can't wait for my next visit.

I come here once every few months for a fun night of bowling and usually all is fine.  Last night left me pretty annoyed.  I walked in and was the only person in line, yet it still managed to take three people behind the bar over 5 minutes to simply ring me up.  This isn't a one time thing either, the front desk is always painfully slow with employees literally just standing around.  We got to our lane and realized ours was one of the only ones with no fun lights; there were also no screens playing videos like there usually are for cosmic bowling.  Just seemed really cheap and sad. The kicker was the pizza.  We put an order in at the food counter for a supreme pizza, and they said when it was done they would bring it to our lane.  That was at 11pm.  At around 11:45 we started getting really hungry and couldn't imagine what could possibly take so long.  I went to the bartender and asked if he could see what was going on with the pizza.....yeah...apparently the food guy just decided not to make it.  Awesome.  So we reorder it around 11:50.  We keep waiting and waiting, and I finally go back up to the bartender (pissed at this point) and ask what in the world is taking so long?!?!  Turns out the pizza is done, but is just sitting on the rack while the food worker is sitting and talking to his buddies.  We finally get our pizza at almost 12:30am.  We actually had to take a box with us because we didn't have enough time to eat it there.  After all that they told us they would take half the price off the pizza....are you kidding me?!?  I think in the end they took care of the whole thing but still it was just ridiculous. I should have had some choice words with the manager.  And the real kicker about the pizza is that it made both my roommate and I sick.  I'll come back here probably only for beer and bowling simply because it's a really convenient location; but I will never order food here again.

I used to go to Magen nail salon with my old roommate and thought it was okay (nothing great, but not terrible).  The nail salon is definitely outdated and in use of a renovation, but I could look over that.  The last time I went to Magen's was the last.  I had to have her shorten my nails twice because she didn't go it right the first time.  No biggie.  I did have a hang nail on one toe that she decided she needed to rip out.  It was pretty painful and definitely drew blood.  No apology.  The best part of this all is that my toe was inflamed and really tender for over two weeks.  Very unprofessional and I will never be back.

I just tried this place today after scoping it out on yelp and seeing all of the good reviews.  Morning star is actually just down the street from my house, so it is incredibly convenient to get to and easy to find.  The place wasn't PACKED but certainly had a good amount of customers coming in and out; a good sign that this place is know for good lunch time fare.  I decided on the green chili chicken sandwich and boy was I not disappointed.  If you love green chilies like I do, this is your dish!  Just the right amount of spiciness, certainly not overwhelming.  The quality of ingredients were high, fresh bread and juicy chicken.  Best of all, the prices are really reasonable!    I believe I met the owner and found him to be really sincere and excited about his business.  I loved the mom and pops feel of this place, and I can't wait to come back and try out breakfast sometime.    My only "dislike" was the coffee; it wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly was nothing exceptional.  It was really nice for the owner to give me a free cup so that I could try it out.    This place just gave me a good feeling all around.  It's a place I'm happy to support.

Service is friendly and the prices are fair. I've only come here for oil changes and tire rotations so I can't speak for the other services.  The location is convenient and they fit me in on short notice.

Although I didn't Purchase my marble from here, I loved it! This is like a candy store for adults. Unlike most stone and tile stores, they give you a map/checklist/hard hat and send you off on your own into the warehouse. It was awesome getting to walk around and look at the various options vs. Going in to look at one item. I think I spent an hour just walking around, drooling at all of the beautiful slabs.  The staff was very friendly and I would Definitely recommend this business.

I absolutely love this place!  One of the best bars I've ever been to. I like country music but I don't listen to it very often and I still had a wonderful time.  Last night was my second time coming to romans,  and I wish it was closer to my neck of the woods.  We rode our bicycles and didn't have locks, so we left them in the side of the building and no one stole them; ) The bartender was nice but poured really weak drinks,  thank god they were on special for $3 for a couple hours.  The live band was amazing!!! The dance floor is  large and inviting, and people don't seem to judge if you don't know how to two step!

I really like this salon.  It's a very fun space with a lot of talent.  I was happy to find a Scottsdale salon that isn't stuffy and pretentious, and that's exactly what I found here.  I think it's really neat that they also have a deli and boutique for clothing and jewelry.  It's not a typical Scottsdale salon, and that's what is so great about it.  Ask for Emily Lopez, she's the best! First time clients also get 50% off services for the first appointment! What a deal!

The only thing really redeeming about this location is how unique it looks inside.  My fiance and I attended a work holiday party here last night and there was much left to be desired.    There were two bars on the main floor with two people working each location; needless to say, the venue was understaffed to cater the drinking needs of 200 people or so.  Not only were there not enough bartenders, the ones working were the worst I've encountered.  I work in the service industry and expect a certain level of professionalism, speed and a quality drink.  It look about ten minutes each time to get a drink; everyone seemed to be diddly-daddling around and didn't seem to understand that a long line should instill some urgency.  On two separate occasions I watched the female bartender pour no more than .25 ounces of liquor into a glass and top it off with soda, and then proceed to charge $8.00 for it.  We found one male bartender that poured a good drink but had the personality of a gnat; he wouldn't even make eye contact with his customers.    The food was mediocre, and not terribly hot.  The dessert table was pretty good though with cheesecake lollipops and mini cups of chocolate goodness.

After visiting Carlsbad's tavern last night for the third time ever, I'm updating my review to show our displeasure with this restaurant.    We were promptly seated on the outside deck for dinner and our server was very quick to greet us. We ordered two skinny margaritas made with casadores, which were really good.  Nice start. We ordered the red chili chimi with a sopapilla for a buck extra,  and meatloaf for our entrees.   Before the food arrived my husband and I ordered another round of margaritas,  and this is where the night began to go downhill. Mine came out perfect, but I have no idea what the bartenders did to my husband's.  He kept telling me it tasted off. I finally took a sip and almost spit it out; it tasted like flat salty sprite, it was so bizarre.  By the time I had tasted it I figured it was too late to send it back so we just ate the cost and didn't finish the drink. Come to think of it, each time we've visited,  we always are served margaritas that are very inconsistent.   The food arrived pretty quickly,  which was nice,  but we were soon disappointed again.  Both meals were passable but certainly not great.  My meatloaf had nice taste but the mashed potatoes were so bland and honestly looked like they came straight from the "instant" box.  My husband's chimi had very little meat and the rice and beans were nothing special.  Our server forgot our spoapilla as well.   If we ever come back,  it won't be for a very long time.  There is only so many times that we will settle for inconsistent drinks and mediocre food.

It's only been two days since I saw jennifer for an extraction/microderm abrasion/light peel.  She was so straight forward and informative, yet super friendly!  By the time I left the appointment I felt a great connection with her and can't wait for another appointment.  P.s. gave me her personal cell number in case I had immedIate qUestions.  Who  does that?  So great.

I love the whole property that Is the sanctuary on camelback.  We were looking for a restaurant with a view and were not disappointed.   Our server was dry and funny and honest.  I appreciated his candor. The other wait staff was also incredibly attentive. The cocktails/wine/most of the food, ranked very high. The ceviche and tofu app. Along w the pork chop were amazing.   As far as the food went, I only had two complaints. The bread they served was pretty awful, super hard and inedible. The second, and I feel bad for saying it, was the lobster carbonara. This dish sounded like a wild wonderful dream and the portion was more than generous. My problem was that the lobster literally tasted like nothing. Perhaps my taste buds are on the slow side, but I was so sad. The pasta was incredible, but alas, the lobster just made me sad:( I guess I ordered wrong:( I also called ahead and let them know it was our wedding  anniversary, yet they never acknowledged it or comp'ed our dessert. That sounds cheap except everyone gets that at the restaurant. Just took away a bit of a "sweet surprise" for my husband.

This is a very unique restaurant to visit for special occassions; I love how everything is underground!  The bar's selection of liquor is very impressive and pretty affordable.  Dinner has always been superb on my visits.  My only complaint is that sometimes you get stuck sitting very closely to other tables because the restaurant is rather small.

Woke up with a hankering for coffee and a bagel. Decided I'd try out this place because it had some good reviews. I was a little worried once I walked in and found a crowd, but the people working there are Pros and I was out of there in five minutes. The bagels were very good and I'm in love with their Christmas blend coffee. Much better than Starbucks

So it's been awhile since my last visit here.  The parking is Always a nightmare and there is always a wait.  The food and the patio were still worth the effort to come here.  Yesterday we ordered the chimi special and I was really let down.  It just seems now that they are always solidly busy,  they have stopped focusing on providing exceptional food. Bummer four peaks, you used to be my go-to, but things are different now.

I don't think I would really classify Z tejas as a four star restaurant, but I love the place for my wednesday afternoon lunches.  I have the day off from work so I like to come here, have some margaritas and usually the chicken mac, and read on the patio.  I'm one of the only crazy people in Arizona that still sits out on the patio in the 116 degree weather.  The staff is always very attentive and are very kind in turning on the misters just for me.  The margaritas are amazing, and the food that I've tried is also incredibly delicious.    3.5 for the food 4 for the margaritas and atmosphere.

There is nothing remarkable about Gordon biersch, unless you dig that corporate type feel. Both the food and the beer are unremarkable. The only cool thing about he place is the patio overlooking mill ave.

I friggin heart Harlows, it doesn't get better if you're looking for a great neighborhood breakfast joint.  I absolutely love the chorizo here, just the right amount of spice.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Absoluetly love it.  Plus if you're a guy, you'll love the yoga pants clad waitresses:)  I took off a point for the annoying parking lot, it's always a pain to find a spot.  Don't even dream of parking in the other store spaces cause you'll get towed.

Now I remember why I don't come here.  My friend and I rode bikes up to Oregano's the other afternoon to have lunch.  There was surprisingly no wait and we were able to get a patio table right away.  Our waiter took his dear sweet time getting to us, even though the place was pretty empty.  He didn't know what seasonal beers were on tap.  I'm a mad woman for lasagna and ordered the original classic flag lasagna with sausage; the sausage was so ground up it reminded me kind of like a pate.  The meal wasn't disgusting but I was incredibly underwhelmed, especially for a restaurant that prides itself on Italian food.   The portions are generous, but I don't particularly want a huge dish of subpar food.  I just think there is better out there.

Never again rositas!! My husband and I ordered some food for take-out Monday night for mindless football grub. We ordered two carne asada burritos, one with black beans and rice, and two beef tacos a la carte. The tacos were $5 a piece, and we're tiny! I'm sorry, but for $5 I could buy a much better taco at a gourmet taco restaurant. The burritos were also small and over-priced at $9.95. The black beans were an absolute joke; they literally emptied a can of beans into a container, with all the fluid that should be discarded when rinsing beans. Neither of us took a bite of those, and they ended up right in the trashcan.  The chips that came with our order were completely stale and chewy. The meat inside the burrito was tasty, so they can keep one star. Next time I want crappy Mexican food, I'll head to fillibertos and save myself $30.

This is the last place I would expect to have a killer craft beer selection, but it certainly does. They also have a Facebook page where they post new shipments and hosted events. 2 thumbs up.

Tops is hands down the best beer/liquor/wine store.  The employees are always helpful with suggestions and they all know their stuff. They usually have great sales on spirits or beers they are looking to clear from their inventory. The only negative of this place is that their wine is overpriced.

I really hate to give such a poor star rating because I really like the idea of this place.  The restaurant is so unique and I absolutly love the outdoor seating.  The atmosphere is very romantic and intimate.  The problem I have with this place is the unconsistency of the food.  The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.  So imagine my surprise when our food this last visit was very sub par.  My boyfriend took me here for my bday dinner and the only really memorable part of the experience was the AMAZING wine choice our very knowledgable waiter suggested.  My boyfriend ordered the short ribs; I'm not sure if it was just a bad cut but it was over 50% fat.  I ordered the bacon wrapped tuna; it didnt seem that the tuna was marinated or seasoned at all, and overall the plate was simply uninteresting.   The atmosphere and service here is great, but our last dining experience will probably keep us from ever returning.  For the quality of food we recieved, we were robbed.  It's never a good experience paying $200 for a dinner and feeling completly unsatisfied.  Sorry Tricks.

Although I did find the two items that I came for,  I was highly disappointed in this place.  It's small and has a lot less than I expected from a "Asian market." The staff wasn't helpful and they didn't even acknowledge me being there until I checked out.

I was very disappointed with this place.  I called and ordered the spicy fried rice with chicken, and attempted to add an order of wide rice noodles. I should have known the order was going to be wrong when I had to explain the a la carte order three times. Surprise!!!! There seemed to be a bit of a language barrier,  but an employee should be familiar with their menu.  I received a large side of albino egg noodles, plain. The ingredients in the main dish were pretty good, but they were so far and few; literally three pieces of bell pepper.  The description says everything is cooked In a spicy garlic sauce,  so when she asked me what spice level I wanted I said medium. Medium at any other thai restaurant would mean a good heat without burning my fave off.  Apparently here medium means they don't even use any sauce.  Dry rice and tiny pieces of other ingredients is what I received.   As if that weren't annoying enough,  the girl at the register was rude and wouldn't even make eye contact.  Sorry you hate your job but I never made you work here. Passible food and terrible customer service will keep me from returning.

Casey moore's is definitely a iconic Tempe college/neighborhood bar that is always busy and usually full of wacky people. Drinks are outrageously strong and usually result in intoxicated coeds and all that comes with that; puking, fighting, surly patrons, etc. People watching here is epic but because the service sucks and it's always a shit-show, I've stopped coming.

I came here in search of a new laptop because they have the best selection of computers in-store that I've found.  I asked the first salesperson his opinion of two different laptops that I was considering; he was pretty knowledgable about the products and was able to answer all the questions I had.  However I was not familiar with the brand that he recommended so I said I would be back; I wanted to walk around the store and spend some time looking up reviews on the product online. After about ten to fifteen minutes later, I returned to the computer area and asked a few more questions to a different employee. I decided on one of the models and told him I wanted to purchase it.  Thats when things turned ugly.  Sales rep #2 goes into the back to find the machine and salesman #1 comes back with it, pretty upset.  He asks who I think helped me out more because they work off commission and they both want it.  It was really awkward and VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!  I told him that they need to leave me out of it and figure it out by themselves, to which he says that he'll be back and that he's going to make his manager split the commission. I feel bad that I didnt realize they work off commission and didn't mean to screw anyone over, but this is definatly not the kind of conversation an employee should be having with a paying customer.    In the end I guess #1 won the battle and he walked me up to the counter with the computer.  The whole time we were walking to the front, he kept going on about the commission and how he cant trust his fellow employees.  In hind sight I shouldn't have purchased it there, I should have just walked out.

Why do I torture myself by coming to this store?  Why?!?!    I came to Fry's looking for a 16gb ipod nano.  There were two different colors out on display with prices listed.  I asked the employee if they had any additional colors, and he tells me that they don't have any actual ipods to sell.  Apparently there is a new version of the nano coming out, so they got rid of the other models.  Okay......well the new ones aren't out yet, and there are ones on display.....why are they on display if you aren't selling them?!?!  Am I crazy?

I love this ballpark!  I love being able to take the light rail from tempe all the way up to the stadium and not have to worry about paying for parking or drinking and driving.  The location is nestled right in the heart of downtown and is easily accessible.  The only think I think the ballpark still needs to work on is food.  I tried one of the new gourmet hotdogs and was incredibly underwhelmed.

The food here is amazing and very spicy:) not for the faint of heart. The green chili pork stew is incredible and the meat melts in your mouth. Had a skinny margarita on the rocks and it was spot on, not disgustingly sweet like most places.    Docked one star because service kinda sucks and is slow.

My husband and I came here Thursday night. We were promptly greeted at the hostess stand and seated outside on their charming patio. From this moment on, we did a lot of waiting around.  From what I could tell,  there were three servers,  two of which seemed to be extremely attentive,  and then there was our server.    Once he finally came to the table we asked him about two different Alexander wines which appeared to be the same but had different prices and descriptions.  He said they were indeed the same thing and it was a menu typo; he However didn't mention which description was the correct one. We ordered a half bottle and when he came back with it, we commented that since it was indeed on the smaller side that we would take another one.  He either thought we were kidding or ignored us because the second bottle never came.   There were quite a few specials that night And our server was pretty knowledgeable about those.  We ended up ordering the bolognese pasta and a procuitto wrapped chicken breast with pasta.  Shortly after ordering, we finished our wine and wanted to have a second glass. Our server took the wine list away and after waiting quite a while for him to return, I went to the bar myself and asked for a menu.    The food finally arrived and I was underwhelmed. The chicken seemed really thin for some reason and the rest of the plate seemed lacking.  My husband seemed to like his bolognese pasta, but when I took a bite all I could taste was a really strong spice. I couldn't put my finger on it but I'd say it was either cinnamon or nutmeg. It would have been inedible for me.  For dessert we ordered the brownie with ice cream, which we should have known better not to get when the server stated "it's a brownie that the cook heats up". Against better judgement we wanted chocolate and ordered it anyway.  The brownie was way too rich and the ice cream was clearly store bought; sadly the best part of the dessert for me was the strawberry on top.   After dessert, we again found ourselves waiting for our server and check.  It seemed as though he had vanished into thin air.   We won't be back to cafe boa. A dinner that should have taken us an hour, lasted over two because the service was bad. The food was simply mediocre for me as well.

I tried out Cibo today for the first time after hearing rave reviews.  The food was good but not the best I've ever had, but the patio and our server Sean Kennedy made this place worthy of five stars.  Right from the get-go he had us laughing so hard and never made us feel rushed when we sat around for two hours giggling.  I can't wait to come back and experience the great patio again!!

The only good thing about this place was the excellent tasting and unique cocktails.  The buck stops there.  I came here last night with a group of ten and although they don't take reservations they ended up reserving a large table for us, which was pretty nice of them.  All the cocktails I tried were unique and tasty but overpriced.  The sushi was really bland and nothing better then RA.  I was hesitant to try the lobster ceviche because of the whopping $21 price tag, but I figured it would be awesome and a generous portion.  When the ceviche arrived it had  three measly lettuce cups and virtually no lobster at all; the few TINY pieces of lobster I did find were tasteless.  I was so disappointed, and actually pretty pissed.  What a scam and ripoff.  I'm not a cheap person but that was just plain robbery.  I didn't even eat a full cup and didn't touch the rest; when the waitress was within earshot I commented how I didn't like the dish, but she never said a word.  I work in the food industry and you should be able to tell when a dish isn't being eaten because the customer doesn't enjoy it.    Our waitress was pretty attentive and friendly but she wasn't present very often.  The whole "no split checks" thing is BS!  It is not hard to split checks and unless they hand write all orders, the P.O.S system is clearly able to do it.  Forcing groups to share one tab isn't convenient for anyone, including the server, and it just pisses people off.  Also the booths are too low for the tables are feel really awkward; good thing we were the first to arrive and got to nab the chairs!    Total bill was $659.00 for ten people.  This place is not worth that type of money at all.  Such an utter disappointment.

Short and sweet here.  This gym is cheap, conveniently located, has no contracts and helped me lose over 20 pounds.  If you don't need a pool or classes I HIGHLY recommend this place!

I love this place!  My fiance and I stop by for dinner about once a month,  yet the wait staff always remember us.  We almost always eat at the Bar top because there is never a wait,  and the service is usually much faster.  Some dishes are clearly better than others but anyone can find something they'll like.  The cocktails are all hand crafted and unique,  and they make a killer Manhattan.

Pf Chang's has really gone downhill in the last few months. Apparently after renovations they felt like they could increase prices without actually making the restaurant better. We came in last weekend for an early dinner before a movie, and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. My husband ordered a Woodford reserve on the rocks with a splash of soda water and I ordered a Woodford reserve Manhattan; my husband's glass seemed really full and watered down and I received a very sweet old fashioned. I let our waitress know about the wrong drink order, the harm no foul, but it took awhile to get my correct drink. My entree had good flavor but it was overcooked. The worst part was the bill. Two cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees cost $63 ($75 after tip)?! Each Woodford cocktail cost $10.75, what is this, scottsdale?? I bartend at a bar in Tempe and know this is price gauging.   This will be my last visit to pf Chang's for a long time. There are too many great restaurants in the valley  to throw my hard earned toward mediocracy.

Came here for lunch today after driving past the place  for years and wondering if it was any good. I drove around the restaurant hoping there might be a free parking lot for customers,  but that wasn't the case,  I had to meter park. Once I found the entrance I was promptly greeted and given a menu, which was helpful because I'd never been here and wasn't familiar with all of the dishes.  Once my order was placed I took a look around the small market and was surprised at how many spices they carried,  they also sold couscous for cheaper than any market I've been to.  I wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to pick up my order,  no one said anything so that was a bit confusing.   The food itself turned out very delicious.  I adored the crispy falafel and the gyro meat was super tender and flavorful.  They included a bag with three Pitas which seemed a little odd. The hummus was also nice and creamy and they gave me lots of it. I feel the prices were a touch higher than they should have been,  but maybe ill just order less next time:)

I freakin love this place.  The food is so darn delicious.  I only have a couple complaints about the place, but the pros far out weigh the cons.  The hallway like establishment is a little too cramped for my style, so I usually call in my order for pick up.  My only real complaint is that no matter how much time you give them, the pickup orders are never really ready; it seems they wait to package the food until your actually there.  Again it's a simply pet peeve but I love this place!  The carne adovada is to die for.

The pasty has officially gone down hill in my opinion. The daytime bartender during the day is very nice but slow as molassess. Always waiting for a drink/food/bill.   Tonight annoyed me to the point of not coming back for awhile.  I ordered a salad to-go with dressing on the side. When I got home the salad was smothered in dressing; not a huge deal.  Came back and they replaced it. Once home I opened it to find missing ingredients and a freaking hair. Not cool.

Mucho gusto is probably one of my favorite lunch restaurants.  The patio is very charming and just lovely to sit on when the weather is nice. I love the tacos they serve here, and the margaritas are strong:)  I recommend coming here only for lunch; dinner portions are the exact same size but more expensive (a little bit of a rip off in my opinion).  Overall this place is nice for a good lunch and conversation.

I love FYE.  They are always running some sort of special on used dvds and cds and you can really make out with a lot of loot for cheap. Buy 2, get the 3rd for $1 is the best!  I've never had trouble with any of their used dvds before, and even if I did, they have a great return policy.

I like this starbucks for a few key reasons; the location is very close to my house, the service is always very fast, and the staff is ALWAYS so nice!  Im also addicted to those little artisan sandwiches they make.

Okay, I really like this place, yet I hate the traffic to get to it!! I will say that the two times I showed up in the afternoon,  I thought it might still be closed.  I meandered through the place browsing and once someone noticed me I got amazing service.  There is a really good selection of wine,  some you can't even find at total wine/bev-mo. An employee turned me into a 2013 juan gil red that is amazing and only $16!   They do wine tastings on Thursdays at 6pm that I wish I could go to, but alas work doesn't allow.  Maybe they will do one saturday? ;) hint hint;)

Came here yesterday with a group of friends to watch the ASU football game and this place leaves much to be desired.  The service was okay, not particularly fast or overly friendly, but it wasn't terrible.  The food however, was garbage.  I ordered the club with fries; I could make a better sandwich at my house and the fries were so overcooked that they were crunchy.  I was still hungry after the sandwich so I ordered chips with salsa and "guac".  The salsa was generic and clearly not made in house, and the guacamole was half of an avocado kinda mashed up.    They had a few decent beers on draft, but mostly the domestic garbage choices.    If you must come here, I suggest skipping the food and sticking with a beer.

The place was a little tricky to find; it's wedged right behind Durants and there didn't seem to be a turn-in off of central.  There is a shared parking lot for the restaurants, but it's pretty small and crowded.   The atmosphere was a bit weird. The restaurant is pretty small and gives off a feel like it should be found in a strip mall.  It just didn't feel classy or cool. We were also sat at the tiniest table ever!   We Started off the meal with two cocktails and an order of crab and lobster puffs. I had the Avion g5 and my husband had a Moscow mule; mine was very good,  his basically just tasted like ginger beer.  The appetizer was very tasty;  the pastries were very light and flaky,  and the sauce that accompanied them had a nice spice to it.  For dinner we each ordered a glass of malbec (yum) along with the clams and Verde valley pork. I gave our server the reign to pick my food (the clams) and I was very happy with the dish.  It's a good meal option for someone who doesn't want a huge meal,  but doesn't want to sacrifice flavor. My husband's pork dish was also extremely delicious.   Of course we had to pull the trifecta and go for dessert.  The creme brule was small but really tasty.    Overall we were very happy with the quality of food we received but weren't wowed with the atmosphere.

I would probably rate this 3.5 but there are no half scores....but regardless, I really like this place.  I have only gone twice but I think they have some great sandwiches.  I LOVE LOVE the eggsalad here.  I ordered it today with 12 grain bread, lettuce, tomato and bacon; after all, bacon makes everything better.    The atmosphere inside is very friendly, and you can tell it's a family operated type of place.  Service and preparation was speedy. No complaints.  Heck, even my kitty (whom is a very picky eater) enjoyed a bite:) I'll be back for sure.

I have only been here once, but I really liked it.  The brewery is very clean and modern and has ample amounts of tvs for sports watching.  The beers here are good, but nothing spectacular.  The food was great!  I ordered a sonoran hot dog and man was it a hit!    Overall I would definitely recommend coming here to hang out with some friends and drink some brewskis:)  Too bad it's so far from me.

I came her to meet with a friend and have a meeting, so neither of us were really looking to have a big meal.  We ordered some red wine sangria and a side order of hummus and bread.  The hummus was tasty and the portion size was generous for the $3 they charged for it.  The menu looked great, so I definitely would like to come back on another occasion to try an entree.

I love this place so much!  Love getting the prime rib and king crab leg combo.  This is the place my fiance and I go when we really want to have a European type dining experience (i.e no rush, 2 hour laid back meal).  Service is always great, aside from the one time we had a drunk server:)  They could have a bigger wine list, but I always find something I like.  I highly recommend coming here for date night.

This place is the epitome of douche-bag Scottsdale.  Pulled up to the $8 valet (tip not included) since there wasn't anywhere to park.  There was a group of ten of us and there was NO LINE, yet the meat-head bouncer told us we were going to have to sit and wait.  Our friend slipped him $40 and he decided he'd let us in.  As soon as you get inside there is yet another bouncer at the bottom of the stairway that plans to keep you waiting as well....there goes another unnecessary tip to bouncer.  The best part of it all was once we got to the roof deck it was virtually empty.   The DJ was downright terrible and kept playing early 90's music.  Anytime a decent song would come on and people would start to dance, he'd quickly change it to another terrible tune.  Drinks are $10 and up and there is NOWHERE to sit unless you are paying for bottle service.  Bottom line is that this hotel treats it's patrons like crap.  This place is trying to be a mini Vegas and it's not working.  I was happy when we left.

As everyone before has stated, this is a place you must experience!  I randomly stumbled upon the yelp reviews for this place last year when I was searching for a byob Valentine's dinner, and I thought the concept of the restaurant was interesting.  Turns out the place had been booked for months, but I thought it was really awesome that Chris took the time to call me and extend a warm welcome for another occassion.  Fast forward a year.  A friend of mine from Boston was coming into town, and asked me if there was any place I had always wanted to try; I threw out the idea of giving this place a try and he agreed that it sounded wonderful.  Thankfully we were able to get reservations this time:)  I really like the idea that the place was byob; it's very hard to find places anymore that allow it.  We had a heck of a time finding the place, but once we did, we were pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was very charming and welcoming.  I was actually taken aback by how small the restaurant was inside; I believe there were 10 of us in the place total.  The tables were pretty close to one another but it somehow worked; it never felt like we were on top of another table.  It was really a pleasure watching Chris at work; I couldn't believe that someone could work alone and  be so organized and efficient.  My friend called ahead to warn of his food allergies and Chris was more than willing to cater to his needs.  THE FOOD!!!!! Oh wow; incredible.  Oddly enough, my friend and I both agreed that our favorite dish of the night was the starter salad.  I believe it was an arugala salad with fresh made hummus, apple and squash.  The hummus was extraordinary, and I had never even thought it belonged in a salad.  Boy was I wrong. For our entree with both chose the fillet and they were both cooked to absolute perfection.  Every item of the plate had such incredible flavor.  Desert was also very good, although the cheese that was used was a little pungent for my taste; so I stuck to the glazed and powder sugar coated strawberries and his homemade cinnammon sticks (I'm sorry, I have no idea what they are actually called).   Overall we were incredibly satisfied!  The cost was very comparable to any fancy steak house you would visit, but this place was by far superior.  Anytime we had a question for Chris he was more than willing to answer; and at the end of the evening when we were the last to leave, he came over to the table and chatted with us:)  I would recommend this place to ANYONE!!!

A group of five of us stopped in for a quick drink and nimble while waiting for an appointment.  The happy hour prices were reasonable and had quite a bit of choices.  All of the food we ordered was EXCELLENT.  I honestly couldn't believe that happy hour food could be so tasty.  Our waitress was average but that's fine.  I was definitely pleased we stopped here.  Yum.

This review is based off of the incompetent online team and the tempe store as well. I ordered some appliances online to be delivered by the tempe store for my kitchen remodel.  Very very long and upsetting story made slightly shorter, I was charged by lowes over nine times for 2 appliances.  That equates to $2700 worth of charges for the $700 I was actually supposed to pay.   I called the store on a daily basis trying to sort things out properly and it took over a week. No one actually talks to one another/communicates/leaves notes in the computer about problems.  Finally I was connected to a manager who was competent and got things sorted out. What a nightmare.    Once I was refunded the screw up charges I set delivery for a week from the day. Gosh darn it, wouldn't you know that the very next day,  while at work,  I got a call that they were delivering that day!?! Had to call and yell at some.more people to get the date scheduled again,  correctly this time.   That said, the only silver lining was that the appliances were delivered at the exact time they quoted by two very professional and friendly guys.

We came here for my sister's baby shower brunch and there was a lot left to be desired.  First,  they tried to charge us $250 to use the larger back room, which wasn't even a private space.  The price didn't bother me considering they were offering all you could drink mimosas but the service was downright bad. Everytime we ordered more mimosas the staff seemed to be really put out; essentially they like to advertise the all you can drink,  but they aren't happy About doing it.   The food was just okay,  as others have mentioned, the selection was smaller than I expected.  I stuck mostly to salad,  fruit,  and soup, but I tried other selections and nothing was a wow. My friends did enjoy the cocktail shrimp and oysters.  Over the experience was okay because of the company I was with,  but I never plan to return.

I found this place off of yelp and I'm really glad that I did.  The meat was amazing; the ribs were my favorite.  The woman behind the counter and was incredibly friendly and very helpful!  While we were dining we were able to see them loading up the huge smoker in the back with tons of meat.  It was pretty neat to be able to see it.  Overall the experience was really enjoyable and I'll definatly be back!

I thought I'd give Bite me a try since it's close to home and I'm trying to find a great sandwich joint.  Showed up for a late lunch to-go around 3pm and ordered the Rajin Cajun specialty sub.  I got home opened the to-go box and was surprised to find my specialty "sub" on a cheap ass hamburger bun?!?!  Not only was my sub on a hamburger bun, but a soggy bun at that; half the bread fell off making a huge mess.    I gave two starts because the combination of ingredients worked well together, even though I definitely wasn't wowed by it either.  The french fries were pretty tasty too.  Bottom line, I won't be back.

I love this place and even though it's a little out of the way, it can't be beat.  The selection here is pretty great but doesn't offer some of the truly unique beers I can find at top's.  That being said, they prices here are amazing; seriously up to $10 cheaper than the stores around me.  Everyone is very helpful and happy here, I even got into a 10 minutes conversation about craft beer with a customer:)  I like that they offer some great beers in growlers too, even though I have yet to get one.  Stop in, you wont regret it.

Came here looking for bulgur and fennel.  The fennel that they had was old, limp leaves and browning on the skin.  They didn't have any bulgur and the employee was totally confused because he never knew it existed.

About 99% of the time I don't eat fast food. However,  on the weekends we occasionally get egg mcmuffin meals that are pretty tasty.  They certainly are still fast food,  and don't compare to restaurant style food,  but sometimes a lil mcdonalds hits the spot.  I love their hash browns.

This review is more 3.5 than 4, but saying that, I actually really look forward to coming here again in the future. The restaurant is in an old house which means it has oodles of charm! A couple friends and I stopped in for a cocktail after lunch to check out the place and were pretty pleasantly surprised. The happy hour drink specials were impressive, $2.50 for all draft beer and $4 house wines. There wasn't an extensive draft list but they did have old Rasputin for $2.50 which is a downright steal. The house cabernet was better than we expected. I took the rating down a  bit because our waitress was not pleasant, she was walking around looking pissed off and put out to be helping us. With a little attitude adjustment this place would be better. I definitely plan to come back and try some of the food at another date.

I finally made it to Culinary dropout after hearing so many wonderful raves about the place.  Came here with two others and a baby and we were seated immediately.  The decor is modern and funky and I loved the giant crystallized chandeliers.  I couldn't believe they had la fin du monde in bottle here; unibroue is one of my favorite breweries and I've never seen it available in restaurants before!  Kudos!  I decided on the fried chicken for my meal, and man it did not disappoint; skin on the outside was perfectly fried and the chicken was incredibly juicy.  They also lightly drizzly some sort of sweet sauce on top that makes the dish unique.  The sides were all tasty but not breath taking.  I tried my sister's pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun and that was also really tasty.    I will definitely come here again.

Bought a groupon for this place and it was fine, but nothing I would ever go out of my way for again.  For the groupon price the pizza tasted just fine, but when I looked at the original receipt before discount the price was $48!!!  This pizza is not worth that at all, a smidgen above chain joints but nothing to deserve the 2x up-charge.  When we pulled up we thought it was closed because there was no one there!  Still trying to figure out why they kept putting me on hold when they were not busy :)

After a year of wishful thinking, I finally got an opportunity to try this place out; I was not disappointed.  I drug my boyfriend out to the four peaks tasting room where I saw Short leash was set up a couple hours; heck what could be better than beer and hotdogs?!?!?  I ordered the moki and it was soooooo good.  I love that they don't use regular hotdog buns here, instead they opt for naan bread which has way better flavor.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back some time for a second round:)

This place reeks of sweat and urine the SECOND you walk into the doors.  Inside it's dark, dingy and ghetto. There was no room to dance or to get drinks without being bumped into every couple of seconds.  The clientele are young and annoying.  I would never come here again.

We came here last night with a larger group, about 12-15; we called ahead and they said they don't take reservations, but they were very accommodating and jerry-rigged some tables on the patio for us.  Service wasn't exactly super speedy but our server was really wonderful and super attentive.  In fact, all of the wait staff was incredibly nice and friendly.  Food was absolutely terrific but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  I tried the firecracker shrimp and was a little let down that they weren't spicier....with a name like firecracker...but apparently I'm now told you can order them in different degrees of spiciness.  I will definitely come back to this place, its a real hidden gem!

I have been here twice and wish I could give them a better rating. "Meh, I've experienced better" is exactly how I feel about this place.  The beer selection is definatly impressive but I feel there is a lack of unique craft beers.   The first time I came to Mellow mushroom, our experience was awful.  Our waitress took her dear sweet time to do anything.  It literally took us over ten minutes to even place our drink order, and then she brought my friend out the wrong drink.  We bailed after one round and chalked it up to them having just opened.  The second experience here was actually much better.  Our server was prompt, knowledgable, friendly and very attentive; I was very relieved to see the service had improved.  My boyfriend and I ordered the all meat pizza and a salad as a starter.  The food was in no way bad, but it just felt like it lacked the wow factor.    Overall I would say I leave Mellow Mushroom feeling like I never really want to come back.....its just "meh".

After wanting to try this out for years,  I was finally rewarded.  The night before we went to havasupai we wanted something quick and easy; this is what my husband brought home.  He purchased the 4 street taco combo and a chicken burrito as well. This is honestly the best Americanized "mexican food" I've had in awhile. The only thing i would change would be to take the sour cream out of the burrito. Otherwise,  Kudos. I'll be back for sure.

I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  My god, the server really ruined a fun night out for my group.    A large group of friends and I decided to meet here to celebrate two birthdays and watch the ASU game.  By the time I arrived there were probably about 15 to 20 people.  I sat at a table and when the server arrived I asked for a beer and to start a tab with just my boyfriend and I.  IMMEDIATLY the server coughed up an attitude and said everyone was on one tab, sorry.  Since I had just arrived I didnt see a reason why I shoudnt be allowed to start my own tab, so she let me, but not without a couple snarky comments to our table.  My friends let me know that she had been rude from the very beginning, when there was only 4 people to start with.    Anytime she came by the table (which wasnt all that frequently) a couple people were ready for another round.  People would start ordering and she would huff and puff and complain that things were getting just too darn complicated.  Perhaps she could remember things easier if she would have written our order down.    Now let me just say that I can understand a servers frustration with big groups.  I work at a bar myself and things can get complicated.  Perhaps if she reads this review she'll learn that most people want seperate checks, and its just easier to assume that from the beginning to keep things clear.  Also someone commented that she was the only server on the patio.  SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT for having one server serve a busy patio on a saturday night; not to mention the fight and ASU game were on to make it even busier.  Remember that SEPERATE tab I started with my card for my boyfriend and I?  Well it turns out she just decided to throw a bunch of our beers onto the other tab because she couldnt keep things straight.....again, writing things down would really have helped out.    I don't know if the server was new or what, but she was disorganized and incredibly rude.  I couldnt believe how much attitude she was giving us...isn't a large tab a good thing?  I've never before had a server who literally rolled her eyes and walked away from patrons who were looking to spend money!!! UNBELIEVABLE.  WORST SERVICE EVER.

The gym is inside the fencing studio, that was a bit confusing to find at first. The workouts are intense and are really challenging, but not so hard you can't do it. The classes are small, usually about 8 to 10 people, which makes it feel like you get personal attention. The only drawbacks are the distance (20 minutes from me) and the Times of the classes. I found this place on groupon but I probably won't be back because I can only make the class twice a week with my work schedule.

This was my first time into the salon and I was pretty impressed.  I had read that parking was a bit of a pain (which it is for a first timer), so I made sure to leave a little early from my house.  I thought it was pretty cool that they provided a parking pass so I didn't have to worry about my meter time.  The nail salon is located inside of the pink hair salon; decorated a lot like a tattoo shop (metal, graffiti,etc).  I was a bit surprised at how small the area for nails was, only two chairs for pedicure and a few others for manicures.  I would certainly make an appointment anytime you wanted to go in, seeing as how there was very little room to sit around and wait  The pedicure itself was great.  There wasn't a tremendous amount of polish colors there, but I was certainly able to find something I liked.  My fella (sorry I forgot his name) was gentle, took his time and was very professional.  I feel a little awkward during pedicures after the small chit chat is over so maybe next time I'll bring a magazine.   Simply put, if you're willing to deal with the parking, this is definitely a place you should try out!  I know I'll be back

We had a wonderful dining experience here yesterday when we decided to stop in for breakfast. We parked our keesters on a patio table and were promptly greeted. Apparently mark's cafe has been in business for 20 years,  and it seemed like a family run type of place.  The service was funny and friendly.  Our food was so delicious, and we can't wait to return!

I have been wanting to try out this place for awhile now, and when my fiance recommended Pita Jungle, I suggested we try this place instead.  We ordered for take out.  Two stars because the gyros were really good, but the rest of the food was downright bad.  We ordered red pepper hummus which usually has a nice kick to it; this hummus tasted like we were taking a bite right into a lemon.  Seriously it was so bad my fiance likened it to eating lemon pledge; it didn't make any logical sense and it was inedible.  The pita bread served with the hummus also tasted pretty stale.  We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.  We were very disappointed with this place.

I'm writing this review after what started off as a good experience turned incredibly lack luster.  I took my friend here last night for her b-day and wanted some grub and good craft beers. It was a busy Saturday night with a wait, so we opted to eat dinner at the bar top.  The food was mediocre and the service was rather good, at first.  After two beers I was feeling a little bloated and decided to end the night with a cocktail, trouble is our server disappeared.  I sat there with a noticeably empty glass for over ten minutes. I located our server in the corner singing and dancing and yucking it up with coworkers and then with one particular male customer (he must tip well).  Finally the other bartender came close to us but only made conversation with the male customer next to us; again I was still sitting there, glass completely empty.  Finally I decided it was enough and just put my card down to pay, and of course that took another 10 minutes of waiting around.  Look, I'm fine with the wait staff having a good time (in fact I encourage it), however this shouldn't come at the expense at the customer's experience.  I work in the service industry and expect a good experience; I won't be back here for awhile after last night.

I adore this place! I've tried a few of their own beers but haven't found anything I've loved. They do however also carry other offerings from other breweries,  and any place that regularly carries myrcenary dbl ipa is a okay in my book. The food has always been good and they have amazing patio space. This place is also incredibly dog friendly and even has a little "doggie bar" with organic treats, dog bowls, and a water station. Makes me sad that my dog is a freakin' psycho and doesn't play well with others.  The back patio is backed up to the canal and has wonderful views of camelback.

This place is awesome;  everything we ordered was spot on and delicious.  The patio was a nice size but unfortunately had no sun!  They lose a star because they were understaffed and made people wait when there were available tables.  Also they could afford to carry a little better of a beer selection.  I'll definitely be back.

I have been using Dr. Molina for a few years now and can't say enough great things about her and her staff.  We all know how traumatizing a vet visit can be for both animal and human; it's great to be able to have my animals taken care of in an environment they feel comfortable in.  I find the prices to be lower than the average vet office as well.  I have referred them to many friends and I do the same for all of you.  London says hi Jeanette

This is by far the best Davids bridal I've experienced.  I came here after trying on dresses at another shop and coming up empty; I was a little apprehensive but gave it a shot because they usually have a good selection and variety.  The inside of this store is really really nice and there are private areas for each bride and her entourage, which is nice because most David's Bridals stick everyone in one large area.  The staff was very friendly, informative and helpful.  My consultant offered to help me into all of the dresses or said I could have someone from my party do it if that would make me more comfortable.  I'm no shy gal and figured she could do it faster, so I had her help me with all the dresses and she was more than happy.  I found the dress I loved on the fourth try and it was really an awesome experience.  I thought it was a cute touch that they give you a bell to ring once you find the dress, and tell you to make a wish for your wedding day:)    I never felt like the staff was pushing me into anything and they really seemed to like their jobs.  Best part was that my dress was $300 off the retail price.    The only possible con with this place is that it's a collections store, which means they only carry certain designers' collections; I believe there were 5 or 6 designers total.  So before you head here I would make sure to call and see if the dress you're interested in is at the store.  Otherwise, happy shopping!!

I found this office through yelp when I suffered a knee injury and decided to give it a try since there were great reviews.  The place is small and cozy; definitely a far cry from the PT office I previously visited.  The best part is that you get one-on-one care and guidance from the therapist the entire visit; you're not pawned off on assistants.  Ryan is my therapist and I couldn't be happier.  Not only does he know his stuff,  but he actually makes the visit fun.   I will continue to come here for any other injuries I sustain,  and you should too.

This place has potential, but it's so far away from it.  I've been once and that was enough. Like most other reviews have stated, the bar is small.  A friend and I decided to try WOB out on a Wednesday afternoon around 2pm; there were no seats available anywhere and we had to stand around in everyone's way until two bar seats freed up.  The selection here is amazing, but it's so overpriced!!! I had three bottled beers and paid over $20.00 before tip.  This place is a joke.

A group of us came to angel's trumpet yesterday afternoon for an early dinner before a concert.  They don't take reservations but we had no trouble getting a table for 6. Our server was really nice and attentive and was happy to give my sisters a few samples so that they didn't end up with something they didn't like.  All six of us ordered different entrees and they were all fantastic! Overall we had a great experience. 4 stars because I would have liked more ipa's on draft and the parking was a bit of a pain.

Definitely wasnt impressed with this place.  The drive thru was very fast and efficient but the food was all luke-warm and a bit soggy. The sauce was lacking interesting flavor.

I won't make the mistake of coming here again.  My husband and I had a little time to blow before a movie,  and I was starving.  Bar Louie is situated right next to the movie theater so we gave it a whirl.  We sat on the patio and were greeted pretty quickly and given menus. We ordered two different ipa's and looked over the menu as we waited for our beers. Once they were dropped off it took me seconds to realize this wasn't the beer I ordered and not even an ipa at that (pretty sure it was a dosxx).  When our server came back I told her about the mix up and she proceeded to smell it and tell me it was definitely the lagunitas ipa I ordered.  I told her I'm familiar with the beer I purchased and that it was definitely was not what I ordered, heck I told her to taste it. I didn't care about the mix up, but I did care about her standing there telling me I was wrong to my face.  I simply ordered another beer instead of being bitchy  about it. The food was very mediocre. I ordered a Flatbread board and it was edible but not delicious. The server was nice enough but I didn't appreciate the condescending way she dealt with things.   Do yourself a favor and just go to the thirsty lion.  It's not amazing but the beer selection is way better, and you get what you actually order.

The carne asada here is super good, but that's about it.  I came here the other night and tried a few dishes; overall the chicken was really dry, the chips and salsa were terrible and the carne was good.  Not worth the trip in my opinion, but to each their own.  Also, whats with the 80's music at a mexican taco stand?

I came here the other night and had a blast!  Our server and bartender were so fun and really created a fun atmosphere.  There was an imperial stout on draft that I'd never tried before and it was exceptional.  This place also has a pile of boardgames for it's customers to enjoy; we unleashed our inner children and played battleship, sorry and jenga:)  Don't come here is you're hungry though because there is no full menu; I know they have food trucks stop by but I don't know if they are there daily.  The tasting room does lose a star because they don't except 4 peaks gift cards yet.

I stumbled upon this place on yelp, saw the amazing reviews and decided I had to give-er-a-go.  The ordering process is a little confusing but the employees are very helpful. I believe the owner  made my bowl of awesome, and he was very cheery.  I was a little hesitant on how I would like the food because all of the ingredients were pretty much piled on each other, but I was very surprised that all the flavors mixed perfectly together.  I ordered the bowl and had gyro, saffron rice, roasted potatoes, onions, tomatoes, green onions, chipotle hummus, lentil salad, garbanzo beans, feta cheese and just a touch of tahini sauce.  I was starting to feel a little full halfway through the bowl, but the food was so great that I couldn't put it down.  I'll definitely be back and I'm really excited that there is finally a good restaurant in that strip mall!!!

Went here last night with my girlfriends and had a really fun time.  The doorman let us in without having to wait in line, which was awesome seeing as this is the newest bar to open up in Scottsdale and it was packed.  The patio was the best part of the place in my opinion; inside you'll find all the douchey people dancing on tables and pretending they're important:)  The dj didn't suck and the prices weren't outrageous.  I'm not big on Scottsdale, but I'd probably recommend coming here with a group to have a good time.

We stumbled upon this place while trying to eat at Monti's on the new patio.  Apparently they are owned by the same people but are trying to bring in a younger crowd with a creative flair to drinks and food.  The patio was really well built and pleasing to the eye; there are a few flat screens and they have large speakers always playing music.  I have to add that the music playlist was pretty terrible though.  Service was top notch and everything tasted great!  I really enjoyed the interesting combinations the chef came up with; nothing disappointed.  They also have a good selection of spirits, and I thought it was pretty neat that there was an option for bourbon flights.    This place can be pretty spendy so be prepared for that, but I thought the experience and quality of food was worth the money.

Came back to use my groupon; the service was friendly but I wouldn't say it was speedy by any means.  The cocktail I ordered was sickening sweet and I ended up trading with my fiance for his moscow mule.  The mule wasn't overly sweet but there were muddled cucumbers that got stuck in your teeth every time you took a sip.  I had the brie sandwich that seemed pretty small and uninteresing.  My fiance had a burger and that was really tasty.  The reason I took this place down a star is because we both ended up feeling sick the next day from the food.  Bottom line, after trying this place out twice, is that I will only be back for the hh wine special.  This place has just missed the mark on the food.

I would give this place zero stars if I could.  I found this restaurant through yelp and the pictures of the food looked amazing; I bugged my husband for two weeks to go, and finally last night we did.   This restaurant is located in the old fox and hound restaurant/bar. Walking in, the space is gigantic and there are only a few tables; huge waste of space.  There is no host or sign letting you know you sit yourself or wait.  We decided to pick a table.    The smell inside is extremely fishy, so much that it's off-putting. Once seated we waited. There was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time that we arrived.  After 5 minutes of waiting,  a guy came over, dropped off menus and walked away.    After paging through the menu we started to notice that we still hadn't even received waters.  After 10 more minutes of no service or water we picked up and left.  This place is a joke.  It makes sense that the place was totally empty.

I came to a baby shower hosted at the henry over the weekend. The place was easy to find and there was ample parking. The space reserved for us was private and the decor was absolutely charming. There were small food offerings which were all pretty decent, and we even had a private bartender. I would probably come back to try this place out for a real meal; it certainly seems like it would deliver.

Had a decent time but it's just another scottsdale bar. The bartenders were actually pretty good but the bouncers are your typical aggressive type. Tried calling and no one answers the phone.

Alright, this is the last time I will update this review, and it's back to a zero star.  After an evening of booze I left my card at the bar.  I called the next day for over an hour with no answer.  Once the bar finally opened I went to the hostess and had her check for my card....nothing there is what she told me.  I went home baffled because I knew I had left it there.  Over the next week and a half, I tried calling numerous times (leaving messages because no one ever answered the phone) and even sent the manager an email; no response.  I finally was finally able to reach someone on the phone and low and behold....they have my credit card.    These people do not know how to run a business and the front girls are either complete airheads or just don't care about inconveniencing their patrons.

This movie theater is awesome. There are only about 50 seats per auditorium and they are all comfortable recliners! I've been here twice and it wasn't crowded at all either time. It's also assigned seats, so you never have to get stuck sitting way too close in the front rows. They have one of those cool coke machines were you can make any crazy combination, and since its in the middle of the lobby I think it's free refills.   The only downside to this theatre is that you have to park in the garage which costs $10. Next time I'm going to see if they validate.

After a lackluster experience I received a message from the owner offering us tickets to the next show we wanted to see. Not only did they get the tickets,  they also reserved us a table in the front row and made sure we had great service.  I really appreciate owners who care about the experience of their patrons. After the show we stopped in to have a couple beers and were pleased with the service.  2 thumbs up copper blues!

We came here on a Friday evening to check out the new place.  Upon arrival it was a little hard to find parking, but they had a lot of spaces.  Once we made it to the hostess stand we were informed that all seating inside was taken but there were patio tables, and we were seated right away.  The food menu is small, VERY limited, but they make their own sourdough pizza crust and we really enjoyed our pie. The beer selection was also pretty limited for craft beer snobs like myself, however, they did have Mission Carrack on draft and were serving them in PINTS!!  Yes please (I'm not sure they know the ABV of that beer).  The best part of our visit was wondering around the bar/restaurant; outside they have a really large cozy patio (one half is self serve, the other is sit down).  Inside there are booths and a bar, and plenty of interesting knickknacks to look at that came from the old Minder Binders.    The original Minder Binders was a bit before my time, but I was always curious as to what the inside looked like every time I drove past the old red barn.  Much of the infrastructure was maintained and preserved and it's like walking back in the past.  The upstairs bar, which isn't in operation yet, looks like an awesome place for live music and libations; I hope they get that up and running soon.  Overall I definitely recommend coming here for the charm alone, and for some good pie and decent beer.  It wont be a regular spot because the menu is too limited, but I will certainly be back.

It's a fact, I am somehow cursed with horrible customer service everytime I try to branch out to new restaurants around the valley.  Diego pops looked like it had a great atmosphere and food when I bookmarked it on yelp. I've been trying to convince my husband to try it out with me,  and yesterday he finally agreed to go for my birthday dinner. What a mistake.   We came for dinner around 7pm and were promptly greeted and sat on the patio.  The misters were really nice and kept the space cool. After sitting at the table for 5 minutes without being greeted by our server, I had a bad feeling that things were going to be like this for the rest of the dinner.  Once our server finally decided to show up, we ordered two margaritas (diego and prickly pear) and some waters. I was pretty thirsty so I sucked down my water pretty quickly. The first round of drinks took over 5 minutes but I was willing to let that slide. Once she delivered the drinks, we ordered chips w gauc and salsa, and I asked her for a water refill. The water never came. From the time she took our appetizer order, we didn't see her again for over 20 minutes. The bar was dead yet it took long periods of time to get simple drinks.  Our margaritas were not overly sweet (a good thing), but they were so watered down; either the bartender shook the crap out of them,  or they were sitting to be picked up for awhile.  Or honestly,  probably both.  Terrible pours on those margaritas.   The food runner brought out our appetizer and again, no water was brought to the table.    Our margaritas and waters were both empty and we had finished our appetizer before we saw her again.  When she came back, we ordered some a la carte tacos and two casadores margaritas (I was hoping a slightly better tequila would equate to a better margarita,  wrong). The food took awhile but it was actually pretty good and the portions were larger than expected. I jokingly commented to my husband that we probably wouldn't see our waitress again until I was done with my meal...almost,  I was eating my last taco before she ever asked how our food was.   A younger couple next to us was also irate with their service.  I tend to be lenient with servers because I work in the industry, but our server was not busy, just inept. The girl next to us was talking angrily and loudly about how they didn't have silverware or sauces for their food. The male got up and went inside in search of some service. That's pretty embarrassing for your establishment.    There was another girl server on the patio that was really doing a good job, and I was very sad we got stuck with the crappy one we got. Received our bill for $72 bucks and left pretty pissed.  Pros- Nice patio Decent tacos (although the jalapeño on the bbq chicken taco was wayyyy too hot; and I enjoy spicy food) Shrimp taco was awesome Food runner seemed on point  Cons- Possibly the worst server I've ever experienced Expensive, watered down crap margaritas ($10 a piece)  What a waste of a birthday dinner.

We came here on Saturday at 3:15 pm to score a few beers and some food before going to the summer ends concert.  The place was busy but the hostess told me the wait was only 10-15 minutes for a table, we put our names in (didn't get a pager or anything) and headed to the bar. The beer selection was good and the service was very friendly.   After about 30 minutes I went back to the hostess stand and asked how our table was coming along, and she assured me they were cleaning off a table and it would be ready soon. After ten more minutes,  I go back to the hostess and she informs us that some random group just walked in and took our table.  Apparently the manager told her that he couldn't make them leave the table.  Sooooo what the hell are reservations and putting your name in for?    After waiting a freaking hour for a table she finally comes up to me and asks "are you guys still waiting on a table?". Ummmmm yeah!?!?! Once sat we waited for a bit and when our waitress arrived she let us know service was going to be slow because she was stretched so thin;  great.   We put in our food asap because we were trying to make it to the concert at five to see a performer.  The pork belly popcorn was an interesting idea but I wasn't a big fan; dry and lacking ingredients I just picked the pork off the top. We also ordered the pulled pork mac and the fried chicken sandwich.  The mac tasted store bought and was covered with bacon bits. It was just okay. My husband's sandwich was pretty decent.    Needless to say, we were late to the concert.  The bartenders and beer selection were good, but the way the place is ran is a joke. After waiting an hour for a table we didn't have a manager talk to us or even apologize.  Poor customer service.

I've experienced portillos both in Chicago and here in tempe,  and both times I've been underwhelmed.  The taste of the dipped sandwich is nice due to the spicy peppers but everything is just so greasy. I don't get the hype.
