Cashier and server were nice, food was prompt. Don't get the tune melt. It was bland, and very dissatisfying. Something I could have made better myself. The atmosphere was cold and unwelcoming. It seems popular and the prices are good but I'd rather spend my $ elsewhere.

my little review. Upon entering I was pleasantly surprised at the decor, cool retro (not my fav style), but it impressed me. The waiter was wonderful and upbeat. Right there when we needed him. The hostess which was a guy (what's the name for him? A hoster?) was welcoming as well. Anyway, the booths were comfy and even liked the lighting. food was delish, we shared the breakfast pot pie, which was big enough for two. Very flavorful, the orange juice tasted fresh squeezed although a bit pricy at $4. The only complaint I have it the noise level was very high. They were busy but I've been elsewhere in the same situation and it's been much quieter. Maybe they need some buffer in the walls or ceiling to absorbs noise. Oh and one last cool thing. There's a bar across the front for looking out to the parking lot and the windows swing up and completely out of the way. Reminded me of Brophy's on the Harbor in Santa Barbara. I will be going back to explore more of their menu for sure.

Upon walking in the first think in noticed was the Pledge of Alliance proudly displayed on the wall. After being seated and having ordered from very polite, I took my time looking around and everywhere is some form of patriotic saying. I also saw a prayer on the wall. I felt the American Pride, American love, American respect. How was the food?  I had the standard eggs and hash browns. Good food nothing fantastic.   Will I come here again? If I'm in the west valley, Yes! Good service, good food, and love of country. One can't go wrong.
