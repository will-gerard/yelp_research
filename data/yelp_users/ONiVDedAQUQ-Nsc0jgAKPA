Stumpy's has some of the best Phoenix pizza I've ever had it's hard to find a good pizza joint and not end up going to dominoes or Pizza Hut but let me tell you ping the two extra bucks for this pizza is well worth it fresh ingredients quick service I recommend this to anyone that's in the area for lunch or dinner I've also had their subs and they're also very good

This is a spot I love to go on the weekends to grab a beer something about this bar is if you ride your bike there happy hours all day and all night whenever you come in also the food is very good and they are quick and serving the selection of beers is great in the bar area is full of TVs which is also very nice

Worst experience me and my friends have ever had waited over 20 minutes for a drink and over 45 minutes for our food we only are allowed to have an hour lunch at work and we spoke to the manager she said only five more minutes they brought our bill but not our food 10 minutes later we were very frustrated by this we will never eat there again and we do not recommend this to our friends please stay away
