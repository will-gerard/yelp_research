The food here is a mediocre 2.5 stars at best. A lot of it was fried and while they do have a few salads and few special daily entrees the food was still sad overall. I had the Caesar Chicken wrap one night with underdone fries...it was OK. I also had the Chicken Primavera pasta which was actually tasty but needed way way more fresh veggies to make it somewhat healthy...they really skimped on the fresh ingredients here. Other than that the chicken strips, onion rings, fish filet and the like were all super fried. The chicken or veggie quesadilla were also OK but I'd just hop a cab anywhere for something a little fresher. The beer lines seemed stale here so I'd order the bottles or stick to cocktails which were made well. That aside the staff was all friendly and on top of things.

I'm going to have to agree with Lauren on this one. This place is a little beat up and completely off the beaten path of any semblance of a night life. You'll need to jump a cab or bribe a shuttle driver to get you to Mill Street or anywhere for that matter. The service was friendly from room service, the restaurant and the front desk but the venue itself was dated. I will say that the pool area was nice and both the pool and the hot tub seemed clean. My room was fairly clean but their wall outlets were limited, the bathroom was cramped and my room and the hallways on the first floor smelled like cigarettes. My bed was pretty comfy thankfully but for some reason it seemed that people were slamming their doors throughout the night all four nights I stayed here. They did have some construction going on early morning but that's a non-issue. Lastly, the in hotel Rimrock restaurant left a lot to be desired so you may want to have a dining plan ready when you hit the tarmac in PHX. The only restaurant in walking distance is a Denny's.

This is a bustling airport so be prepared to move quickly when necessary. Baggage claim was easy peasy, check-in on return was a breeze and security flew by also.   The gate that I left from was stacked with people so find a nice spot to sit until pre-boarding and don't move otherwise someone will steal your seat and you'll be standing or sitting at a gate further away.  The restaurants in the area of C3 looked inviting and they had some tasty offerings, above and beyond what I'm used to seeing in Detroit anyway. Sandwiches, pizzas and taquitos if memory serves me....just a few nice options while you're waiting.

I came for a business dinner so I have no idea what the bill or the expense was, but the food was fantastic. I'm not sure if they pulled out the stops for our group of 20+ but everything down to the bread was perfect. The little olive oil trio they serve alongside it was a nice touch - and again, the bread was crusty and perfect.  We started with Martorano's Salad and moved into some apps that I don't quite remember but recall being very happy stuffing them into my face hole. A stack of fried mozz with fresh tomato...more please. The meatballs were heaven, the chicken cutlet (City Chicken Stack or some such thing) was divine and a few others were also wonderful. The one glitch was the underdone rigatoni but no matter. I didn't love the trout scampi style but I'm no fan to cooked fish.     There are several big screen TVs to around the room showing Italian genre mob flicks like Goodfellas, Casino and The Godfather so that's fun but it is a little loud and obnoxious if you're hoping for a more intimate experience. Service was tip top and family style dining kept the food rolling in and all of us content. Definitely one of the better spots to eat in the Rio at 4.5 stars.  FYI the cannoli was good but the red velvet cake was OFF THE HOOK!

This place is kind of sad but if you're eating here then it is what it is. I wanted something familiar and fast and while the Bacon Bleu Double Whopper was tasty the prices here are a little expensive for what you get...but it's Vegas, right?!  A medium Double meal was over $10 and it wasn't fantastic. The service was friendly but not exactly quick and the store itself...a little dirty, FYI. It'll do in a pinch but I'd take it back to the room next time. They do serve beer though and they have a few big screens.

I had to knock this place down a star for being overly loud...with speakers above each booth it was a little obnoxious how loud this place was while the game was on. My table of 6 could barely carry a conversation without yelling across the table over the speakers.  The chips and salsa were mediocre but they did continue replenishing the chips until the salsa was gone thankfully. The tacos were amazing on the other hand. Definitely worth four stars on their own. I tried the Duck Carnitas, the Al Pastor, their Carne Asada and the Beef Cheek taco. I'd recommend each of them and twice on days ending in a Y.   The drinks were a little weak for the prices. I had the Bulldog-Garita with the mini bottle of Sol tipped upside down in the chalice....not very strong for a 32oz. marg....the Mexican Mule wasn't my favorite either. At $10 each just order beer or tequila or both.  All that aside service was tip top and the servers here are all attractive with ASU down the block. Worth a stop in for some great tacos outside the norm.
