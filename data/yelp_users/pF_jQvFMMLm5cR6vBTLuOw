Ate here a few weeks back there was a bit of a line but it was well worth it. There salsa bar was fully stocked with plenty of options. I got my food togo, and got a variety of items as to try a couple things, and was not disappointed by any of them, everything was very good for the price. I will be back.

There selection of house beers is nice, my boyfriend and I love IPAs which theirs are not to bad.  Some are better then others. Our first time here was after the kitchen was closed. our most recent visit we came specifically for dinner and are leaving disappointed. We had the poutine for an appetizer which we just warm, very bland, and needed salt. I ordered the burrito and thought it came with guacamole.  I even asked to make sure it came with guac but no guac inside and I didn't even get my side of sour cream like it says on the menu. The red chile sauce was subpar again, needed salt and was barley warm. I'm not really sure what was up with the amount of cucumbers that were very large diced that were in my burrito, I would be ok with some but they made up 50% of my burrito . I was disappointed and prob won't eat there again.
