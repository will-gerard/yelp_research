What kind of place puts up a banner with a special deal and then won't honor it? False advertising at its best. See the photo I posted with the beer and pizza special.

Awesome service and timeliness!  It was my 14th wedding anniversary, and they really jazzed up the flower arrangement for the occasion. Definitely will be using them again in the future!

Awesome customer service!  Usually with the coupons from repair shops there seems to always be a catch. Not Here! They honored the coupons with a smile and did not try to up sell me. I will definitely be back!

Terrible service! Ordered the enchiladas combo plate and specifically ordered chicken tonight. When my meal came, the counter person who took my order proceeded to argue with me that I ordered cheese enchiladas. I have never eaten a cheese enchilada in my life. So, I basically did not get to eat dinner tonight because it went in the trash.

I have been a loyal customer at the old location since they opened in 1994. I was excited to go to the new location, and it had been awhile since my last visit to the Tempe location. Well... what a disappointment for several reasons: 1) Parking is joke 2) Food quality has gone down hill. My Tikka Masala was horribly overcooked as was my daughter's Chicken with Hummus. 3)The waiter spills half a pitcher of water & ice on our table that lands on top of my daughter's iphone, chicken and pita, and never offers to take it off the bill or replace it. 4)The restaurant smelled like it might have sewage backup when I went to the restroom. "Why do all good things come to an end?"
