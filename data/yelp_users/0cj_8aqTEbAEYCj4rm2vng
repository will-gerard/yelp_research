Customer service is virtually non existant, staff is rude and completely unhelpful.  The entire operation from equipment to billing is extremely antiquated. The snack bar is never open and the entire place smells, bathrooms in particular.  Speaking of bathrooms - I have yet to even think about showering here.  Bathrooms are disgusting and seem to never get a good cleaning or cleaned with sanitizer.  Fitness class space is crammed and there seems to be no air circulating at all.  Cardio equipment if often broken or out of service and their is no sense of urgency to repair things including the sauna.  Try a spin class - completely unorganized and there is apparently some sort of process to reserve a bike???  I was so frustrated that I after three attempts I gave up. Staff is completely misleading upon joining, advertisements are a bait and switch, and the elusive owner cannot seem to return  a phone if her life depended on it. (I gave up on this too - after the sixth attempt to reach her.)  I also think it's a bit overpriced in comparison to the competition, which have far more to offer and they only allow you TWO guest passes PER YEAR (Most gyms allow for 1-2 PER MONTH!).  Unless they are able to retain and recruit the  "senior" aged clientele (which is their primary membership demographic it appears), this gym will be bankrupt in no time.  I would HIGHLY advise against joining and would suggest not wasting your time or energy here.  I'm moving on to a real gym.  If I wanted to join the Mickey Mouse Club, I would have went to Disneyland.

Service was good but that's the only positive thing I have to say about this place. Eggs were flavorless. Biscuits and gravy were dry. Hashbrowns were lackluster and the crepe was more like a soggy omelet which was accompanied by the strangest looking and tasting hollandaise sauce I've ever had. Won't be returning.

Not impressed. Service was below average for a steakhouse who's menu and pricing would be considered comparable to a Flemings, Durants etc. We started with a weakly poured vodka tonic and some calamari (small portion) which was just "ok". A lettuce wedge followed and  the lettuce was brown and wilted opposed to being fresh and crisp. For the main course we both had the 14 oz ribeye and it was very good. Properly cooked, decent cut of meat and nicely seasoned. Steamed veggies and a loaded baked potato were chosen for our sides and they were ok, however, the baked potato does not exactly arrive at the table "loaded". They were kind enough to let you do it yourself. (And if you do, I would skip adding the "Bacos".)  We realized that our waiter had not brought our bread to the table and politely asked for a basket. He came back with a couple of small pieces and said "Sorry, we're almost out of bread."  We didn't stick around for desert. Overall, I would consider this to be an average AT BEST experience and would most likely not return.

This is a super fun burger joint with great burgers! There is a burger for everyone here. Atmosphere is cool too. Great location and easy parking with great service. I will be returning.

Wow. I'm not sure who's running this place but PLEASE GET NEW MANAGEMENT. My daughter and I go for donuts once a week like clockwork (sometimes more often but we have a designated day and go before school starts).  In the past SEVEN visits, our order has been wrong FIVE times.  And there is yet to be an "oh, my apologies"...nothing. If anything, it was a bother to have to correct the order. And for the love of God, don't ask anyone to count proper change or correct an error pertaining to what you've been charged.  It won't happen. It took three of these bumbling idiots fumbling around with the cash register because they were unable to do simple math. And I you go through the drive thru, expect your donuts to be thrown into a bag with half of the icing stuck to the inside of the bag and the other smashed or flattened because they should've been in a box to begin with. I'll make the drive to the Dunkin located inside of Cobblestone. The staff there is fantastic!  Take note Dunkin on Riggs!

Joined LA Fitness this week primarily for the classes as I am already a member of another gym. I showed up for my first class class where the instructor was ten minutes late and ended the class five minutes early, making the one hour class now a 45 minute class. I came in today for another class and the instructor no showed. There room was packed with people just waiting and nobody even bothered to let us know that there was a problem until someone finally asked. The class was ultimately cancelled. On my way out, I let one of the team members (Joseph) know what had happened and he could've cared less. He said that they don't have any control over the classes as they are handled by an aerobics manager. All he cared about was getting me enrolled. Once you've signed up, anything resembling good customer service is out the window. Way to go LA Fitness. There's a lot of competition in this area. I'll go somewhere that cares about the members and maybe I'll get what I'm paying for.

Obsessed with Opa Life's gyros! The meat is tender and seasoned to perfection. Their salads are fresh and flavorful too. Clean and comfortable with excellent service. I heard that they have one at Westgate that's much larger but I love the Tempe location.
