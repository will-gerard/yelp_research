(Update: I guess I was getting too noisy, because my mortgage was dumped onto another lender so I don't have any more recourse. Do not do business with these liars and thieves.)  I was offered a loan modification, were misinformed about process and our payment was increased instead of reduced. Caused us to file for bankruptcy.  One year after I bought my house, I received a notification that there was a mistake with escrow the way my mortgage was written, and that my payment was increasing by nearly $200. This was not something I was capable of doing, I signed a specific mortgage to make a specific payment. So, in 2010 I applied for and was considered for a loan modification, after signing on with a third party agent who failed to perform any of his duties and forced us to file a lawsuit, we contacted BofA directly who finally claimed to get the unfinished paperwork processed and started the modification process.  The first packet we receive for our three month "trial" period stated a new payment that was an INCREASE of approximately $300. I called specifically about this and arranged an in-person meeting with one of their loan modification specialists at one of their corporate centers in my home city of Phoenix. I was assured every time that this increase in payment would not be permanent and it was a direct result of being behind on my payments. I reluctantly accepted this, and forced my way through the further burden on my finances.   After my three month trial period, I received my final paperwork. Contrary to everything I was assured by every level of employee at Bank of America I could contact, the $300 increase was, in fact, permanent. Managers I contacted to complain behaved as if they were doing me a favor because despite the $300 increase, the months I was behind were being forgiven.  So, they were basically telling me I could accept the new payment and be forced to file for bankruptcy, or deny the new payment program and face foreclosure instead.  In doing this, Bank of America caused me to file for Bankruptcy in order to keep my house. And were thoroughly unapologetic and unwilling to correct this injustice.  It has been over a year now, and we have just completed our Bankruptcy and had the case closed. What do I receive in the mail? A statement from Bank of America saying I owe late fees on my mortgage payment (approximately $250) that they refuse to correct, which was a direct result of removing our mortgage from their Bankruptcy department and failing to inform us of doing so. Then, I was sent (via overnight FedEx) a packet that they claimed I requested for a Loan Modification.  When we called to complain, we were told that this was just "mass mail". Not only is overnight FedEx not mass mail and clearly a lie, their records should show more than clearly that I had been thoroughly through a "Loan Modification" program with them previously. This is a gross misappropriation of funds and just further evidence of their negligence and abuse toward their customers.  A letter of complaint was written onto their Facebook page. It was deleted with no response. Bank of America agents are unwilling to correct their own errors and rectify the abuse I have suffered by their actions. I have been mistreated time and time again by this organization and they do not care. I have finally had enough. I can provide any paperwork necessary to substantiate my claims, but it is nothing that Bank of America does not have on record.  We have filed a complaint with the BBB (CASE#: 438356), and will continue to complain to every organization we can until this is rectified. I have been abused by this organization quite enough, thank you very much.

I had a run of postcards I needed printed in pretty much less than a day. Impact made it happen and didn't screw me over even a little bit (in fact, I think I paid less than I would have at those big office stores)   This place is top notch and I can't wait for an excuse to give them my business again.  Well done!

I have had two experiences with the ER at JCL, one to take a good friend in because it turned out he had internal bleeding a week after surgery from another hospital, and more recently because my wife had high fever and nausea that was the result, we discovered, of pneumonia.  It also happened to be this past Valentine's day when the second happened.  Both times, the staff did not screw around. We were in a room and under care almost immediately. The nurse and staff was extremely attentive, ran all of the appropriate tests and made an accurate diagnosis that yielded immediate results; all of which without a single error or any interaction that I could possibly complain about.  I have a great deal of respect for the medical staff that has helped my loved ones at John C Lincoln and I can confidently recommend their Emergency Room to anyone in need of one.  (Thank you, Karen!)

I have to say that the last time I visited Castles N Coasters was a much better experience than the time before.   This last time I went with my kids for my son's birthday, CnC was cleaner, the employees were friendlier and more helpful, and we had a better experience overall.   There are coupons in the Entertainment Book, and CnC isn't exactly cheap so definitely use those if you go. The arcade is nicer, with more modern selections but also keeping the classics upstairs. If all you want to play is modern arcade games, Dave and Busters is probably a better value for the money, but we were pleased.  I really wish they would expand, as I have heard rumors of them taking over some real estate that belongs to the dying mall nearby.  Also wishing they had an elevator inside for wheelchair/stroller accessibility.  Still, for a city that doesn't exactly have a "theme park" this isn't a bad place by any means.

Sekai Sushi keeps it simple, so I will do the same with my review: The place is clean Everyone was friendly It wasn't crowded at all (Sunday evening) The prices were average (for sushi) But the food was fantastic.  It's a little hard to find, pushed to the back of the shopping center (which also seems to be rather nice and clean) but if you're in the neighborhood, two people can eat very well for $40 after tip.  Thumbs up

I don't normally shop at GameStop, but I was given a gift card a long time ago and I needed it out of my wallet so I dropped in to get a game I've been meaning to pick up for my 3DS.   They had both games I was interested in new and used. The new price was $39.99. These games have been out for over a year. A quick check on my smart phone shows them for $29.99 online, shipped free. Welp, I had a gift card that I have to use up, so I checked out the used copies, surely they would be closer to $30....  Nope. The used copies were a staggering TWO Dollars less. That's right, 39.99 new or 37.99 used. I thought this had to be a joke.  I begrudgingly grabbed the new copy, I'm not buying a used game to save only two dollars when I know that GameStop is notorious for giving customers pennies on the dollar for their trade-ins. A markup so absurd, knowing the game's developers got precisely 0% for that sale just made me angry.  So I took the case off the shelf for a new copy of my game, and took it to the counter. Guy literally opens the shelf case, which is covered in stickers and damage from being manhandled by everyone and their children, reaches into a drawer and snaps the game cartridge in.  Incredulously, I looked at the clerk and said "No. This is a new copy I'm buying, give me a new one in shrink."  His response? "We don't have those. All copies of the games are in the drawer and the cases are out on the shelves."  "New AND used?"  "Yeah..." (rudely)  And as he says this, he slaps ANOTHER sticker onto my game case, a big clear round one over the opening-- just in case of I don't know what. So now there's more adhesive residue garbage on my game.  It is absolutely unacceptable for a business to operate this way. And there is no reason for anyone to shop there when new games in undamaged condition cost less elsewhere. I will never return.

Not bad by any stretch but it didn't rock my world either.  I would normally give this place only 3 stars but I was wowed by our waiter when the pitcher of margaritas I ordered for the table came to us as a full pitcher in addition to every glass being full as well. Most places just don't do that and it was a very nice gesture to make up for the extra few minutes we had to wait for them to make it.   I don't know if this kind of behavior can be expected per se, but I am definitely grateful for that added touch and they found a way to differentiate themselves from the hundreds of other Mexican food places in phoenix...for me anyway.  They deserve an honest shot in my opinion. Don't know if I will rush back, but I am glad I tried them.

FANTASTIC Teppan Steak and Sushi.  There isn't much more that I can say that others haven't. This place is clean and friendly, good atmosphere, the prices are...well...sushi prices.  The Teppan table is a show in itself, the steak and calamari are both outstanding, but the sushi bar is wonderful as well.  Order yourself a sake bomber and a Tempura roll--best sushi roll on any menu I have ever had. It is essentially a Philly roll that has been tempura battered and flash fried, then drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. The thing is practically a dessert, you must try it.

This place is not to be confused with PATSY Grimaldi's, which is in SCOTTSDALE, but also quite good. I think a lot of people come here thinking it is something else, and then get their panties in a bunch and whine because they're stupid and can't read.  If you're looking for simple and delicious pizza and wings then you have found the place. This is one of the best classic pizza and wings joints I've been to, easily in my top three. The pizza is thin yet floppy, the toppings are great (try the sausage, it's sliced like pepperoni), the wings are crispy and the sauce is nice and hot... The food is just good.   It is a full service place, I've never had any service issues there. The counter register is for take-out orders (duh) They have some good beers on tap too. I like to get a pitcher of Amber bock there with the folks when they're in town.  If you're a coupon person, they are in the 2009 Entertainment book, very much worth it.  The bottom line is that both Grimaldi's pizzas are outstanding, but know where you're going before you go there and complain.

I've never really been too thrilled about Zoos. I went to the Reid Park Zoo a lot in Tucson as a kid and I have fond memories, but really I have never really been terribly impressed.  Well, my skepticism was laid to rest when we made the drive to Wildlife World.   The very first thing you'll notice as you enter the park is that it does NOT immediately stink of animal feces, unlike every other zoo I have ever been to ever. I get that smells are unavoidable, but I have never before entered a zoo unassaulted instantly by the unrelenting odor of beast poo.  Aside from that, a few of the habitats they have are very cleverly designed. A Jaguar habitat has a bridge over the walkway that the cats can sleep on so people can get very close looks and interactions with the animals. I've never experienced that before.  They had other attractions like that, such as giraffe feeding and a petting-pool of stingrays that were excellent up-close experiences with these magnificent creatures.  We got to see penguin and otter feedings that were fascinating as well. And the connected Dillon's BBQ restaurant didn't jack up their prices just because of their location (and the aquariums inside were amazing)  I highly recommend Wildlife World over the Phoenix Zoo if you are trying to pick one of the two.

If you have a Restaurant.com gift certificate, be warned that the ownership has decided they won't honor them anymore, even though they have no expiration date. (Have fun trying to get it exchanged).  And don't bother asking to speak to a manager about it, the hostess will ignore you with a deer-in-headlights stare.  I won't be returning here.

This is a really fun gaming supply shop that is a toy store for grown ups. Everything from dice and cards to full-on poker tables can be found here.   I ordered from this place back in 2009 when I needed some dice and their prices were very good. They have since gone up, but it's a neat place to find some oddities nonetheless and their staff is very friendly.

As far as hotel food goes, this place was pretty boss. We dropped in several times during our Phoenix Comic Con experience to get burgers to go and every time the service was friendly and the prices weren't too bad (location costs, remember.)  I specifically remember their ranch dressing being incredible with their fries so be sure to remember that when you order. But the burgers are huge, and the buns themselves are very hearty, almost pretzel-like in consistency.  Would be 5 stars except the well done burgers I ordered came back very pink pretty consistently.

I feel very blessed to have Dr. T in my life, she was a terrific doctor who listens and has helped me in my family many times. She cares about us beyond the doctor/patient realm and when we are hit with a crisis of some kind she will go out of her way to provide the care we need.  I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. T and her staff. They have helped me with some serious problems and I am much better for having them in my life.  If you are looking for a new doctor, this place does very well.  Thank you!

If you want to pay $15 for a burger and fries that tastes like it should have come from a drive through and will make you rush to the bathroom in a cold sweat, then FUDDRUCKERS IS FOR YOU!  (No. We did not have a pleasant experience.)

Great homemade tortillas (nice and thick) The service is good The food is good.  Losing a star because they're priced a little high, but if you go family-style and share the whole-pound fajita plate(s) it eases the sticker shock a smidge.   Also, try the pork fajitas, they're much better than the chicken.

As far as a McDonald's this close to a Wal-Mart goes. I was actually kind of impressed with how well kept it was. Comparatively speaking...  I had some time to kill before an appointment so I sat down with my laptop and had a coffee. There were tables with power outlets available specifically for customer use and the free wifi was nice.  This is McDonald's we're talking about here. They get 4 stars because my expectations were very low and they actually managed to impress me quite a bit during my short visit.

The last four or so times I have come here over the past few months, no matter what time of day, no matter what day of the week, I have to wait because their "Hot and Ready" pizzas are neither hot nor ready.  This is a problem that has persisted since before their remodel and it is getting a little out of control.  Management here badly needs to re-assess their sales projections and make sure they have product "Hot and Ready" as advertised and correct their preparation schedule.

Damn good pizza.  My wife and I dropped in on a whim, I used my iPhone's Pizza app to find somewhere new that we hadn't tried. And the 4.5 Stars that Luna had according to the Yelp reviews found on it were well deserved.  Thin foldable crusts, flavorful yet crispy wings, oregano and garlic salt right on  the table (WHERE THEY BELONG)  I was thoroughly impressed, and the price was right too. Check them out.

Pretty decent pizza. Not the best in the world but light-years ahead of Dominos. On Mondays, pizza is 50% off when you dine in or carry out and it's a great deal.   Their wings are mighty tasty too.  Can't say I recommend their Sicilian crust, but the hand tossed is pretty darn good.

I don't bother reviewing fast food chain places unless there is something I really feel like I need to say...and today I do.  I've lived in a neighborhood where this is the closest Taco Bell for over five years...and I have kids. So they want tacos every so often.  And in all the times I've been to this place over the years, for late-night dinners, for offsite lunch during work, whatever, this particular location has impressed me in the long haul.  This Taco Bell has NEVER, not once, gotten my order wrong. I can't say that about any other fast food place ever.  This Taco Bell's employees have always been so polite, friendly, and kind that they may have given me diabetes.  These people do a job that is by comparison, pretty lousy, and they probably get abused by a lot of rude folks in town. But they deserve to know that their efforts are noticed and appreciated.  Hats off to the staff and management here, you are an example to the entire chain.

It's been a really long time since I've gone bowling, and this wasn't a bad place at all.  It was pretty clean and the bowling specials they had available at the time I went were a very good value.  The only thing I can really gripe about is their Bar. A pitcher of beer sounds like a good value, but when they get them out, there's a huge metal cylinder in the middle which they fill with ice from the bottom and screw on a cap before filling it with beer. Yes, it helps keep the beer cold but effectively it makes the pitcher accommodate about 60% of the volume. Very clever trickery that most people don't notice, but if you have any education at all it will probably just piss you off.   We got some appetizers while we were there and truthfully they were pretty decent. The place was well stocked with public-use bowling balls of all sizes and weights (a problem other bowling alleys commonly have) and it wasn't crowded.  I wasn't wowed, but I wasn't overly disappointed either with anything besides my beer, so...yeah, this place is alright in my book.

Not a bad place. Small, quiet, good atmosphere. The food is reasonably priced and the pizza is better-than-average.  My wife and I like to go here once in a blue moon because we used to live in the apartments right down the street from it. Plus there is a 2-for-1 coupon in the Entertainment book that makes it a great way to try it out.  Service was pretty good too. Never had to ask for a refill.

I've been going out of my way to go to Church's lately rather than KFC because Church's doesn't tend to make me sick. Which is great.   This isn't really a good location to sit-down at but for anything to-go I am always treated well and the prices are good. If they are out of something and I have to wait, they will usually hook me up with a soda or some extra biscuits for the wait without even having to ask, which is something most places just don't have the sense of service to do anymore.  Lost a star because the place could be cleaner, but it's not that bad.  Give them a try instead of KFC next time!

Let me first say that the Brass Armadillo is a great place to SHOP. I find lots of neat stuff in there, sometimes for a bargain, but typically the Antique shop fare with Antique shop prices; not that there's anything wrong with that.  But today I come to you as a former SELLER from the Brass Armadillo. And for this, the Armadillo gets two stars.  I am a BSBA graduate. I understand business inside and out. I examined the Brass Armadillo's model, and it's brilliant...for everyone except the sellers. I did the math; I am completely baffled how anyone could possibly make any money selling things at the Brass Armadillo.  For a glass display case, the Brass Armadillo charges you about $85 per month (80 + fees) and then ~10% off each sale. Sounds attractive, until you consider that most large items simply do not sell.  I have been going there for years, and the store always looks the same. Most large items remain in the store for long periods of time and do not move anywhere. Which means essentially that you can expect to sell (if you're lucky) about $100 worth of small stuff a month and make exactly no money from it. Which is what I did for two and a half months before saying "no more."  The management staff treated me somewhat apprehensively when I originally inquired about the case, which was off-putting. Maybe because I'm a younger guy in my twenties and most other sellers must be around middle-age or better. But after a while (20 minutes of waiting to be exact) I was finally helped with the paperwork so I could move my products in.   Here's a fun fact: sellers can "volunteer" to work in the store in exchange for credit toward their monthly fees. Which amounts to about $7 an hour if you do the math. Despite this, these volunteers were the ONLY people that were genuinely friendly and helpful toward me. They always complimented my case and the artwork of mine that I sold in it.  Anyway, long story short. Nothing significant sold. I was losing money in spades. I sold some small rare items for meager returns that failed to even help me break even after the dues and fees. When I came in to discontinue my membership, the management was less-than empathetic to say the least. I would venture to say they didn't give a damn at all.  Mind you, the place has about two dozen glass cases empty at any given time. To retain selling customers, a logical measure would be to perhaps reduce the monthly fee or take some steps to help ensure customer satisfaction in some way. But no, not for the Brass Armadillo, they are above that and would rather have empty cases that net them zero profits, I guess.  In conclusion, my experience as a seller in the Brass Armadillo has been thoroughly dissatisfying. I would urge anyone considering to sell there to first try Craigslist or eBay because you'll lose a lot less time and money that way and it pains me to say that people on the internet will probably be more friendly toward you.  Here's to a few hundred dollars and a paycheck's worth of my time that I'll never see again.

This is a great place to watch any game, ridiculous number of TVs all over the walls. The food is very good too. Nice place to play darts if you're into that. I really don't go here often enough.  Be warned it is a very busy and noisy place. Not good for kids. Otherwise, highly recommended

Great wings, good pizza, great service. Overall, a positive experience. The dining area is very small and cramped but it's not a big deal (just try to avoid going with parties larger than 6... (4 is the best number for the seating they have available)  Also, they have only one beer on tap: Bud Light. But it's only $7.50 a pitcher (which also happens to be just a $1.50 more than a pitcher of soda) so the price is right at least.   I definitely want to go back to try them again.

Two times now I've been to this location and they were not participating in advertised specials, and frankly I am just tired of it.  It would be nice if the corporate franchise would make franchisees post clearly if they are not participating in wide-range advertisements, but I've learned my lesson about this location. I won't be stuck in their drive through trying to get dinner for my kids again.  I recommend any of the other locations in the area, I have never had this kind of difficulty anywhere else.

This place has awesome pizza. That's all I can really say about that. It's awesome.  The place is priced pretty high though, but it is Scottsdale after all, and the mentality there is that it's acceptable to overcharge and have an attitude. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  It's also usually packed also, expect a bit of a wait. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  Oh, and the parking. It's Old Town Scottsdale, so naturally, parking is a NIGHTMARE, every lot is full, I think I had to park half a block away on a Saturday night. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  Honestly, I don't really remember if the service was any good. ... But that's OK, the food is awesome.

Pete's Fish and Chips has a reputation for being legendary in the Phoenix valley, so of course I had to try it. And, wow, what a miss.  First of all, they had outdoor seating only, which isn't so bad I guess. Oh wait, no, we're in Phoenix, doesn't it get to be about 117 degrees F outside in the summer? Sounds like a blast.  Secondly, they have no tartar sauce or malt vinegar. How on earth do you even run a fish place with no tartar sauce? Malt vinegar is a little more uncommon but for pete's (lol) sake even McDonald's has Tartar sauce.  Third, the fish itself. Speaking of McDonalds, that is what I am reminded of, this is not batter dipped and fried fillets of fish, this is minced and formed, and covered in a crunchy, crumbly breading, like what you'd find on a Mcdonald's fish sandwich.  Fourth, they only take cash. What year is it?  The red sauce they give you is OK, but it is more like a shrimp sauce, I'm sure it would be great on that. It definitely does not belong on fish.  Their Hamburgers though, are quite good and very inexpensive. If you go to Petes, get one of those. Skip the fish, it's awful. I have no idea how this place became so popular on such awful fish and chips. An Englishman would burn this place to the ground.

Ono has always been a great go-to for Hawaiian lunches, their teriyaki and katsu chicken is great but what really makes it is the fresh house-made sauces. And the macaroni salad...oh man, put a little bit of soy sauce on it. Just trust me.  I used to visit the Scottsdale location a lot back in the day, but recently when I happened the in the neighborhood of an Ono I insisted that we stop in for lunch.  In the time since my last visit to an Ono, I was disappointed to see that the prices had gone up, and that they no longer served burgers.  But really those are the only negatives. Ono is consistently great food, and their restaurants are consistently well-kept and clean. Highly recommended!

Great place to spend an hour or two and drool over all the amazing toys.  They have it all, dice, cards, roulette wheels, blackjack tables, art...everything gambling related is here. The prices are a little bit better than other nearby places and their showroom is bigger as well. I thoroughly enjoyed stopping in here and found some great gifts.   They sell decks of cards that were used in the WSOP, how cool is that?

Out-freaking-standing.  The pizza was perfectly baked, fluffy thick crust that was crispy in all the right places and not too greasy. The toppings were excellent and the pre-meal table bread was even noteworthy.  Service was excellent, never had to ask for a refill. And they have daily specials for holidays, service workers, even for anyone with a certain name.   Overall, just a very cool local place that definitely has a good rep for its good eats. This particular location also has this cool 80s deco vibe that I really dig, and that's just gravy.  Check this place out! Best of Las Vegas for something like seven years running...and with good reason.  (Check in for a free soft drink, your entire party can check in and all get a free soda!)  We even came back a couple days later to eat again while we were still in town, turns out they don't open until 11, but they let us in 20 minutes early because they're just that nice.   A++ would dine again.

We got a 59.99 per night suite with a $30/day meal credit deal on a suite from a site like travelzoo or somesuch.   Here's the experience: Incompetent concierge tells us on the phone that we can check in early (noonish). Apparently this did not mean actually getting our room but rather some pre-registration nonsense that kept us out until 4 due to their failure to specify.  The line at check-in was 40 minutes long and only 4 counters were attended. I parked in the garage which is inconveniently far from the hotel rooms, and they refuse to let me use a luggage cart unless I have a bellhop with me. What, are they afraid I am going to steal it? Honestly?  Our room itself, is actually quite nice. This is somewhat redeeming for them. Except the refrigerator wasn't on and I had to call twice to get someone to fix it.   8:00pm on night 1: NOWHERE TO PARK. There is some Italian festival nearby and nobody is attending either garage to make sure actual hotel guests have a place to put their vehicle. After 45 mins of trying, gave up to go pick up friends at airport half an hour early. Disgraceful.  Called concierge to get answers to some questions just before 9pm on night 1. Got an answering machine...I wouldnt mind waiting on hold until someone was available, but ten bucks says we don't get a call back.  Horrible sewage smell outside that did not go away.  The shower literally takes 20 minutes or more before I get even lukewarm water running through it.  Going into nights 2 and 3 our friend's meal credit was screwed up more than once by the hotel staff. Ours, luckily, worked as intended.   All in all, our first night there made me want to give this place less than one star. The incompetent, inconsiderate, or just illiterate hotel staff was infuriating and the venue of the WSOP should be classier than this. I should never see a line going out the door to check in  to the hotel on a Tuesday and there are three or more vacant check-in counters that could be getting used.   The restaurant staff on the other hand was all very friendly, but I will review those places separately.   Suffice it to say, we will not be returning to the Rio. The experience was very unbecoming for them and for an off-strip casino on weekdays, the table limits were way out of line. Skip this place.

Their late night happy hour is great, but they don't tell you straight away that it is at the bar only.   Fortunately there were enough seats at the bar for our whole party and we had a great time nonetheless. The food was outstanding and the bartenders took great care of us. One of them forgot that I ordered some sushi with no avocado but when he realized his mistake he comped me a beer without even being asked. I am A-OK with that kind of no-hesitation customer service.  Nice atmosphere also, great decor. But the place is arranged very tightly and can be very noisy.  Also pricey, as sushi/teppan usually is, but I highly recommended Sapporo for a special night out, they certainly exceeded my expectations.

Amazing.  If you can't imagine what Mexican-Asian fusion would taste like, Chino's is a must-see. There is nothing like it and the food is outstanding.  I never thought soy sauce would be good on refried beans either.  I recommend the Jen Red Chicken and the Chinese BBQ Pork. Hengrenade Chicken is good too if you like the flavor of Jerk but not all the pepper.

As far as Vegas buffets go, this is actually one of the better ones and definitely a worthy stop if you're using the Buffet of Buffets offer that is basically unlimited buffets at all the Harrah's properties for 24 hours for $45.   Most buffets have ice cream. This one has Gelato.  Real sushi (not just "krab" meat California rolls) and a Miso soup machine that dispenses it like a coffee machine (it was good too)  Careful going in the evening though, they can get a line.

We came in for lunch and we were absolutely delighted, Flavors was outstanding at lunchtime. Rudy kept our drinks full and the Churrasco Pork was to die for, and the $9.99 all you can drink beer/wine was worth every penny. I would rate it 6 stars if I could.  It was so good, we thought we would come back for dinner. But when we did, it was like we had come to an entirely different establishment. The entire mood and attitude was changed. Trying to get a drink refill was like pulling teeth, eventually the original lady that was supposed to be our server disappeared entirely and another guy pretty much adopted our table since we were calling out to him so often. The cooks were lazier at dinner than at lunch and didn't get anything refilled in a timely manner (particularly the Churrasco pork) and one of them was just plain rude. The 9.99 all you can drink was not as worth it this time as my companions barely got four drinks out of it with all the trouble they had getting served.  Between my six-star lunch experience and my two-star dinner experience, Flavors averages a 4 for on the whole.  I suggest you go for lunch, and if you see Rudy, tip big. He's the man.

Even if you hate buffets, just try this place. If you're using the Buffet of Buffets offer that is basically unlimited buffets at all the Harrah's properties for 24 hours for $45, you'll want to come back again and again.  Most buffets have a hunk of dry roast beef they try to pass off as Prime Rib, this one will actually serve steak.  Ice cream? No, these guys do gelato. Speaking of dessert, how about a freshly made crepe made-to-order?  I would be giving this place five stars but the particular waiter we had was very inattentive and it was difficult to get our drinks filled.

Whatever you're after, books, music, games...check out Bookmans.  The prices are reasonable, and their trade-in policy has improved, now you can get anything you want, trade in a pile of magazines and get an Xbox game. No more A Trade/B Trade segregation.  I frequently find good Nintendo games for $1 or $2. And Boardgames ahoy, lots of rarities that you just don't see in stores anymore.  Give them a try, you'll like it.

Mediocre.  We went to Brazilian Bull last year looking for a more cost-effective alternative to Fogo De Chao (which is out of this world, by the way) and frankly, we were pretty disappointed. The meat just wasn't cooked properly.  The service was good, I suppose. I would hope they have improved since we went so long ago but recent reviews aren't terribly convincing.

Their food is great, best I've had since I last visited South Tucson. Salsa is always fresh, and each time it tastes just a little bit different so you can tell (at least I think) it's made by hand.  And every Tuesday and Saturday, 99 cent margaritas with a meal purchase (limit 4, so you can't exactly get trashed) but these aren't dinky solo cup margs either, they're well worth the trip alone.   A+ would eat again.  I have heard that the other location is not quite as good as this one, so buyer beware. Make sure you're in the right...ahem...neighborhood.

I wasn't really very impressed. Bajio isn't *bad* by any stretch, but it's certainly nothing to really rave about.  The prices were a little steep for what you get and everything (keep in mind, this is mexican food) was oddly sweet for some reason...and that struck me oddly.   Burritos and such, served in a very Chipotle-esque fashion, but for a few bucks more than Chipotle.   I don't believe I'll be returning. Not because it was a negative experience, just exceptionally "meh".

This is a great store. When I wandered in after work one day, the owner invited my wife and I to come participate in their Thursday Night boardgaming and we have made it our Thursday night event. You just come in, boardgames in hand or not, and play for free with everone there. If you play something you like, it's usually right there on the shelf ready to buy. We've been playing Dominion there a lot lately, it's just a good fun time.  Everyone we have ever met inside that building that we have taken time to talk to has been completely polite and friendly. We haven't come across one true nutball or rude jerk in our entire time going there and that really speaks volumes, especially when you consider the kinds of people that can wander into game stores. Sure, most gamers can be a little eccentric, but if you've never met a real nerdcore dickwad, consider yourself lucky.  Their selection is great if you're into boardgames, but they are particularly specialized in wargames like Warhammer and Hordes. Half their store is dedicated to it. TCG selections are very limited, but if you're not into that at all then why go to a store that's always crowded with Yu-Gi-Oh thugs and Pokemon kids?  Their prices are average for the kind of product they sell, no better or worse than the mall's game stores. The store is, by and large, pretty darn clean. Everyone is helpful and friendly. When they get their Air Conditioner fixed (or when the weather stops being so brutal, whichever comes first) this place will be almost perfect.  Well done, Imperial Outpost.  Edit 8/25/09: They got their A/C fixed! Hurray!  Edit 9/15/09: IOG has started doing Magic: The Gathering booster drafts every Friday at 7pm. Avoid the stuffy FNM crowd and play with some people who are there to have fun!

As far as a fast Burger and shake goes, this place is tops. The fries are thin and crispy but not overdone and their frozen custard is a dream. You'll know why the shake straws are half an inch thick right away, they work perfectly for the thickness of their custard shakes.  The prices aren't too high either, for the quality you get over your average fast-food place a buck or two goes a long way here.  If only they had more locations, I honestly just keep forgetting this place is around because every time I go I am immediately glad I did.   Their hot dogs are pretty "meh" but it is a burger place afterall, so you should be having one of those.

I was told Gamer's Inn would be a gaming mecca in the desert that is the greater phoenix valley. And, in many respects, it was. The place is, in fact, open 24 hours, has just about every game I could think of off the top of my head, and was an active LAN gaming center. To some people, that is enough to make it heaven, fair enough. But there are some major areas that need to be improved.  First of all, the place is a dump, the entire store is one big mess- wires dangling from the ceiling, junk stacked in corners, shelves and tables and racks stuffed in wherever they'll fit. The LAN gaming is tucked between the shop and the playing room in this thin cramped hallway to keep it dark, but feel free to try and walk through it without tripping over crap. It doesn't work. Oh, and the restroom is a complete delight, there was no toilet seat and a sign that said "Standing room only, no pooping please." Classy. So, I hope you don't have an emergency, and I hope you aren't female. There must be something wrong with the plumbing that they don't want people using it for #2, but a good business would get that fixed. Also there was no toilet paper, no soap, and no paper towels. Also classy.  It's not that I am a clean freak, but this is quite literally the worst-looking game shop I've ever visited. They could seriously benefit from having someone clean the place up. I don't know how they get away with serving food, quite honestly.  Then there's the staff. I've visited this place twice and each time different people were working. The first guy was pretty friendly (and he was working alone), but had absolutely no idea what was going on in terms of the store's own events. I would blame him, but their website's own monthly calendar hadn't been updated in three months.  The second time I went in, there were three guys behind the counter. Was was playing magic on the counter, ignoring paying customers. The second was typing away on a laptop as I stood right in front of him waiting to be acknowledged, and the third was leaning back in a chair and had his feet on the countertop. None of them knew when the Magic booster draft was starting, it was supposed to begin at 6p that day, but at 6 nobody was there for it and nobody could take a minute to ask anyone else. I waited another hour and a half for the possibility of an 8pm one, and finally the guy at the counter asked me to tour the store and ask if anyone wanted to play *myself*.  As appalling as it was to be asked to do this person's job, I did it anyway because I just wanted to play a damn game. Well, nobody else wanted to play, well, a small group did (containing the person that was playing magic with the clerk at the counter) but politely declined because they were broke.  So I returned with a blank list and said goodbye to the workers and left.  The management at Gamer's Inn desperately needs to take control of their staff, I was not made to feel welcome or that my money was something they even wanted, and at no point should employees find themselves unaware of store events or caring so little as to fail to get said scheduled events started. Upon further consideration, I am not even sure all of the people I found behind the counter were even employees at all. In fact I hope they weren't, because of how rude and inconsiderate they were in general. But it begs the question 'why were they even there?' Trying to buy something from them or to ask a question about a product behind the glass was like pulling teeth, and I have never had to do that at any other game store before. I came all the way from north phoenix to visit this store and I was made to feel like they didn't even care about my business. Wrong answer.  It is almost as if their mentality is "We're the king, and we don't have to care." Gamer's Inn seems to be riding on the fact that it is the only store in the valley that is open 24-7 and offers "everything." Their prices aren't even any better than anyone else's. (except maybe the $1 per hour LAN, but I don't use that)  I would describe my experience as "completely unacceptable" and I will be reluctant to return except for special engagements.

Who likes dentists? Nobody, right? So, I took a look back on all the dentists I've ever had and it was pretty easy to say that Dr. Core and the staff at Legacy are my favorite.  I go in, I get my cleaning, I get my xrays, I get straight-talk, everyone is friendly and helpful, they are amazing with my children.  I've never had a problem with billing, scheduling, insurance, or anything at all with these people. The office is always clean, and they have bottled water (and sometimes cookies...I know right? weird for a dentist office to serve sweets) in the lobby.  Legacy Dental Group has made my four year old son excited to see the dentist.  That should say enough right there.

I love Weinerschnitzel, but this location is FAIL.  I went in with a coupon for lunch as I was working down by ASU that day. I placed my order to find out that it would have just been cheaper if I had ordered the combo instead, but then discovered that on top of it all the clerk rang me up wrong. This isn't usually a big deal, so I just asked that they correct my order to the pretzel bun chili dogs that I enjoy so very very much.  Short version of the story was that the manager was rude and I had to swipe my card again for another 60-something cents for the pretzel bun upgrades. A good manager would have just done it for having screwed up my order but he copped an attitude with me as well.   Maybe he mistook me for an ASU student trying to cause him trouble and not, you know, a paying customer. Who knows.  Just make sure you speak slowly and make them read your order back to you (TWICE) and you should be fine.

My wife and I like to go to D&B because we signed up for the online mailer and get lots of coupons. We always have a good time.  Their happy hour specials are good, and half-price Wednesday is a great value (but take note: they don't take their coupons on Wednesdays)  I have fond memories of the arcade from when I was young, and now there is an arcade for grownups that serves beer!  There are still kids running about, but establishment policy is pretty strict about unattended minors, and there is an adults-only curfew at about 10pm I think.

I came in for a quick checkup on some things and to have a mole removed before my health insurance gets downgraded next month.   I had all my paperwork completed before hand, and I was rewarded with a less-than ten minute wait. The staff and doctor were very friendly and understanding. I got my procedure done and my prescriptions filled without any fuss or argument about what my needs were and how I felt about what was going on.  Aside from having a chunk of my head cut off, it was actually a pretty pleasant experience. I would recommend Dr. Jeffries to others, certainly.

This store no longer exists.  Edit 11/8/10: Changed to 5 stars, Manawerx is under new ownership and is sharing a store for the time being with Imperial Outpost Games in Phoenix. Rumor is they may occupy the suite next door. More as it develops.

When anyone from Phoenix, or especially Tucson, considers a Mexican food joint ending in "...berto's" it is extremely easy to picture a place that is rather disgusting and probably about to get shut down.  Not so with Filiberto's. This PARTICULAR location breaks the stereotype of the abused and unclean fast Mexican food restaurant by actually being cleaner than most sit-down restaurants. I've been going here for quite some time now and this location is always spotless and the food is always excellent.  I never have to worry about getting sick when I go to this place. There are awards for their quality and cleanliness all over the walls. If you've been burned by other ____berto's places, give this one its rightful chance, you'll be getting what you were intended to.  Well done!

I had to rent a car for a day while mine was being fixed under warranty for an A/C failure. The lady at Enterprise got me an awesome van that accommodated my large group, gave me rides to and from the service department, and made an otherwise terrible experience (having your car blow up on vacation) into a rather nice day in the end.   The prices were very fair and there was zero hassle.   Highly recommended.

"Ordinary food done extraordinarily well" or something like that, is their motto, and you can take that to the bank.  Joe's Farm Grill is pretty inconveniently located for me (I am in north Phoenix, Joe's is in southeast Gilbert) but every so often...it's worth the trip.  Joe's angle is that it literally is a farm, and much of what they serve is apparently raised on that farm. This translates into basic diner faire of outstanding quality.  Their burgers and fries are out of this world, and their onion rings are possibly the best I have ever had. Homemade cheesecake, lemonade, pizza, all kinds of things on their menu that you would see anywhere but much better than everywhere else.  The location is very clean, and if the weather is nice, their outdoor seating is gorgeous. Even their bathrooms are something to admire (you'll see what I mean)  I don't get out in that area much, but when I do, I always try to get out to Joe's. Highly recommended.

The service was incredibly slow and the food wasn't very good. I ordered the fish and chips expecting a typical fish and chips experience. When I learned that it was actually tilapia, I was curious at first when when I tasted the overcooked, too-thick batter over the crumbly fish I was immediately turned off.  They do make some good flavored lemonades, but really I was just horribly disappointed.

My wife and I always enjoyed the food at The Place at their previous, smaller location, so we were happy to hear they expanded into a larger restaurant.  We were also pleased that they were open for dinner most of the week, so we went in to have breakfast for dinner (they do have a dinner menu, but they serve breakfast all day, so, heck yeah.)  Long story short, I got the steak and eggs breakfast a 12 oz steak, two eggs, hashbrowns, and pancakes. For twelve bucks. I likemy hashbrowns well done and unlike most places, the waitress listened and they were great.  The steak was outstanding, I believe it was a sirloin. A 12oz steak for $12 bucks?? You can't beat that, I don't care what it comes with.  The staff was great, the restaurant was clean, everything was top notch. I will definitely return.

The food here is out-freaking-standing. Hands-down the best Italian food I have ever had. The pizza is out of this world, and their mozzarella appetizer is indescribably perfect. Of course I wish all prices were lower, but the pricing here is certainly appropriate for the quality of their fare.   The only downside is that this place is TINY. Their reservation policy is a little inconvenient (reservations have to be placed before 3pm) so forget about getting a table in less than an hour if it's after 6 on a Friday or Saturday. Also they literally have 2 (three, maybe?) tables available for large parties, which can make it ever longer.  We discovered this difficulty on our most recent trip (our fifth) and the highschooler they had seating parties was unskillful and rude. We had to ask for the manager after we were still waiting half an hour past their 30 minute estimate for our seating.  But every other visit to Times Square was a 5-star experience so I will give them a slide on that one time. I was told they are working on opening another larger location, which would be great. Because it seems like they currently occupy a remodeled 7-Eleven (yeah, the building is that small.)  A Large pepperoni/mushroom pizza and a cold Moose Drool (beer) at Times Square is really difficult to beat though. Highly recommended--but don't go during peak hours or you'll have a bad time.

Total Wine and More is a liquor mecca. All kinds of obscurities and mainstays under one roof, it's beautiful. The best part is, the prices are great too. I can get a 750ml bottle of Johnny Walker Black label for $19 sometimes, that's about half as most other places.  Twelve packs of beer (good stuff, like Dundee honey brew and Moosehead Lager) for ten bucks. Tequila, and I mean good tequila, for about $20 a bottle. Kegs, boxes of premixed martinis, oh, and wine. My wife and I bought all the wine for our wedding here, they even give you a discount if you buy by the case.  I never walk out of there for less than $100, and that's only because I find so much good stuff. I always try to grab something new and interesting when I walk through the aisles. I am sometimes caught by sample stations giving our samples of wine or beer and it's so good (and priced well) that I typically grab some of that too.  My latest discovery is TY-KU, an Asian spirit which tastes something like Sake, Melon liqueur, and Green Tea. It's only $20 for a large bottle and the bottle has a very pretty light in the bottom that illuminates the green deliciousness when it sits on your shelf. It's fantastic over ice.  I've been going here for two years now and there are only TWO things EVER that I have asked for and was not there, hard root beer, and mexican bottled coca cola. That's it. And I've asked for some pretty obscure things...so that ain't bad at all. They have a really nice Cigar selection too if you're into that kind of thing.  Anyway, enough of my rambling. If you're a drinker (drink responsibly) and take a trip over here, you'll be glad you did. Oh, but the sign on the front is misspelled. It should read "Total WIN".  ...zing.

This place is awesome!  It is a little pricey, but sometimes they have an all-you-can-eat fish and chips special for about $10 which is totally worth it.  The food is authentic, I haven't had fish and chips this good anywhere else in Phoenix (especially not at Pete's) the chips are cut thick, the fish is fresh and tastes hand battered, the fillets are whole. Plenty of tartar sauce and malt vinegar too.  If you're into beer, the place has a great selection of Euro brews. There's Soccer on the TVs, they sell all kinds of awesome Irish and Scottish and British foods, and they have some of the wildest flavors of Potato Crisps from England also.  The place is absolutely packed on Fridays, so expect a wait. They also close a bit early, like around 8pm typically. So plan your trip. It's worth the trouble.

Mido came to me highly recommended by some friends of ours. By the end of the night he was apologizing to me, when it should have been the restaurant staff.  Our evening started smoothly enough, we had a party of 10 and they seated us promptly which was good. The waitress who came around the first time didn't understand my drink order the first time I gave it, so I repeated it and there was no further issue.  Then came time order sushi, our party was doing the all-you-can-eat deal, so we asked for separate ordering slips so we could keep the tickets separate. The waitress did not understand what we were describing to her and became flustered and panicked (English was not her first language) because they apparently keep everything on one ticket typically. Which would normally be fine, but I needed to make sure my own orders were clearly segregated because I have an avocado allergy. So the lady summoned another waiter to us and I had to explain that we wanted to keep the tickets separate and why, it was no big deal.  We ordered sushi, and for my two sons we ordered chicken dishes off the normal dinner menu. While we waited, a sweaty glass was fumbled by a combination effort of the waiter and my eldest son trying to rescue it. Nevertheless, broken glass and ice water covered my boy and our table. Waiter came back with towels to clean up, it wasn't really clear that it was anyone's fault, just frustrating.  Then our orders began to arrive. Our entire table of 10 got all of their sushi, but my boys' dinners were missing. My younger son is 3. We weren't about to eat in front of him.  HALF AN HOUR goes by and we don't have any staff visit our table...for drinks, to check on us, or anything. I flag down a girl who wasn't our waitress and try to discreetly tell her we were still waiting for two dishes for my sons.  The waiter came back a moment later and said he was sorry and that he forgot them and they'd be out in a few minutes. I was without words.  When their dinners finally arrived, my sushi had been sitting on our table for 40 minutes, and was considerably closer to room temperature than I would have liked, but I made my own decision not to eat while my children waited. The food was pretty good, not the best by a longshot, and some of their rolls are made in ways inconsistent with dozens of other sushi restaurants that I have frequented in the past. If this review were solely for the food, I would say 3.5-ish stars.  Our second order of AYCE Sushi takes a little bit long, but by this time the restaurant is crowded, and I can literally see how fast and frantic the sushi chefs are working, so I don't cause a fuss.  When the last order finally arrives, we sit and chat for another 15-20 minutes or so while no staff visit our table, we flag someone down and request the bill. Then, gold strikes and some other woman who we hadn't seen yet before comes to our table with a notepad, asking every person what they ordered before we could get the bills for our party. I bit my tongue and complied and rattled off everything I ordered, not mentioning the unacceptable delays for my childrens' dinners as I was confident someone had brought it to their attention already. But the question remained; Why were we telling them what we ordered? It wasn't "OK who had the philly roll, ok and who had the sake bomber...?" etc, it was "what did you have?" as if she had no idea and nobody wrote anything down from our original order or that the tickets that we deliberately asked them to separate so they could, you know, make this part easier for themselves, had disappeared.  Then came the bill. Full price charged for the order, even the late forgotten meals, plus 18% gratuity added on.  I walked straight to the cashier, pointed at the gratuity and said three words clearly and softly. "Remove. This. Please."  I gave him my card, signed, and left.   I am beyond pissed and I am not going to return.   TL;DR: - First waitress had a panic attack over keeping my no-avocado allergy order segregated from others - Glass of water broken onto our table and my sons. - Forgot my kids' orders-were 40 minutes late to our table. - Wait staff visits to our table infrequent, often had to ask for other passers-by for assistance - Completely clueless about what our table ordered. We had to tell them everything we ordered as if the original order tickets were lost - 18% auto-tip added on when it not only shouldn't have been, but I should not have been charged for my kids dishes after having to wait to eat. - Never going back. This is not a 4-star establishment.

Chili's is Chili's. It's mass marketed bar/grill food, so I'm sure you know what to expect when you go.   But this location actually impressed me quite a bit from the last time I went some few years ago. The service was actually very, very good. The gal was training a new employee with us and considering even that I was still thoroughly pleased.  Chili's is a chain. Standard Bar/grill faire. But of all the places we could have gone instead, this was actually a very positive experience.

The food here is outstanding. It smells like a campfire and tastes amazing. Even their fries are something awesome.  The only reason I can't give Bryan's 5 stars is because their prices are a bit higher than they really should be. I mean, really, they are quite high.  Another personal complaint is that they really have a bad location, I love going to Bryan's but I don't love the 40 minute drive. I would really like to see another location opened somewhere nearer to Phoenix proper.  But if you're into good BBQ and on a quest for the best. this is just one of those places you need to try. You'll be glad you did.

My wife and I were set up to stay here when we had a house flood and let's say the circumstances could have been a whole lot worse.  This is one of the nicest hotels I have seen in the valley. Very clean, friendly and accommodating staff. Pet-friendly, Grocery service, Daily hot buffet-style breakfast, Free dinner social every mon tue and wed, and a very nice pool.   Our insurance paid for us to stay there so I can't speak for their rates, but I was certainly impressed with the quality of our stay. It was very comfortable.

As far as second-hand stores go, Savers is one of my favorites in general.  They tend to be cleaner, and priced more appropriately than Goodwill has been over the past few years.  I like I get my kids clothes here since they have this weird tendency to grow and wear out what they wear (go figure) so I try to take advantage of their daily Half-price special on a random tag color.   Every once in a while I'll get lucky and find a good board game (I'm a board game designer and collector, so I love finding oddities) or even a nice shirt or pair of pants that are (either practically or sometimes literally) brand new.  I think I even found a nice pair of hiking boots once when I was about to go camping and was in a pinch to just get something on the cheap.  Wash everything before you use it, of course, but I've had pretty good luck at Savers.

Awesome waterpark, being recently built, all of the attractions are modern and creative.   We went near the end of the season and the crowds weren't too bad. We also used a groupon kind of thing that got us discounted admission and unlimited soft drinks.   We rented a cabana, which is a terrific idea if you have kids, by the way. If they lowered the prices on those, I'd be really likely to do it again (and considering we were the only ones using one apparently, I think they could increase revenue.)  Wet and Wild loses a star because they desperately need to fix their misting systems and/or recoat the surfaces on the stairs, sidewalks, and handrails all over the park. This is Arizona and those things are consistently hot enough to burn, especially with the long lines that can build up while waiting for some of the slides, it is especially important.   Otherwise, it was a pretty good experience!

Noisy. Crowded. Mediocre food.  I also call their cleanliness into question. Upon attempting to use a mustard bottle at our patio table, a piece of dirt/napkin/dried-out-mustard had jammed the tip of the squeeze bottle. What I thought was just thick mustard exploded all over myself and my wife when whatever was clogging the end was forcibly ejected from squeezing it.  +1 star because the waiter was kind enough to bring towels wet with soda-water for us to clean ourselves up.

Right so, this is clearly a stoner joint, let's get that out of the way.  If you can get past that, prepare yourself for an amazing sandwich. If there is anything that potheads know, I mean really know, it's food.   This was easily one of the best subs I ever had and I will definitely return. Even their PB&J for the kids is impressive.   Also: Kool Aid on the fountain.

I was surprised to see so many medium-to-negative reviews about this place. My wife and I went last Thursday night and we were incredibly impressed.  Mellow Mushroom is a dine-in restaurant, so it is a little pricey. But it's easy for two people to share a medium pizza and an appetizer and get out for less than $30, which is pretty average for your typical dine-in experience. There is a bit of sticker shock if you order carry out (three pizzas and two appetizers to go can run you $75)  But, having said that, it's worth it. I've been on a quest to find the best pizza in Phoenix and upon first bite Mellow Mushroom was easily in my top three. Their hand-made pretzels are fantastic (try the Garlic Parmesan) and the pizza is most excellent-- I get what I always get to test the water, pepperoni and mushroom, and I was very impressed.  The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Unless you were a sheltered child, you can probably tell that this is a hippie themed kind of place with hints of stoner undertones. Say what you want about that lifestyle, but potheads know their pizza. Our server, Chris, was very friendly and was happy to tell us all about the company history--which is a fun story too.  We tried it on a whim, and we had a great experience. I highly recommend giving it a shot if you're a fan of pizza. Their half-white-half-wheat dough makes a really interesting flavor and the texture is slightly chewy yet crunchy on the bottom, it's excellent.  They also have a promo right now, if you go in there and get one of their business cards, you can bring it back between 2/15/10 and 2/28/10 for a random prize--drinks, pizza, etc.  Bottom line: I loved it.

(Ordered for delivery through their own website)  All the recommendations for the crab puffs are absolutely correct, they are outstanding. The egg rolls were standard, not awesome not bad either. The sweet & sour sauce though... very, VERY good. They included extra large containers of it with the crab puffs and my sweet & sour chicken and I couldn't be happier with it. Delivery was prompt and ordering was pleasant and painless.  The prices are a teensy bit high but not terribly disparate with other chinese takeout places of the like, and if you use soy sauce, be warned that this place dispenses artificially flavored (as opposed to naturally brewed) soy sauce packets which, to me, are absolutely vile and ruin otherwise good food. Other than that, I recommend Tasty House highly and will order again.

I really, really like Dunkin Donuts and I don't go often because, well, it's terrible for me.  But the last two times I have gone to this location, they have been out of my favorite donut...vanilla creme filled. Vanilla Creme filled donuts are pretty much the reason I go to Dunkin Donuts in the first place. Donuts are everywhere, coffee is everywhere, but nobody does the Vanilla Creme quite like DD but this place always seems to be out of them.  The first time it happened, they offered to make some more, I just had to wait a little while. But this last time, the supervisor or whoever was just too busy to be bothered with customer service and told his cashier (in view of me, whether he noticed or not) to basically give me the "So sad so sorry" treatment.  Either this is a popular selection and they neglect to prepare properly every day, or I don't know what. But if it's in the morning, try a different location.  To their defense, I did visit this one location late in the evening once a long time ago and the guys were about to close up and gave me a great deal since they would have had to throw everything out anyway. So I got a bunch of extras to take to work the next morning. But 95% of the time when I want Donuts, it's in the morning. This is the peak time and when they should be best prepared. I'd give them three stars just for the awesome guys that hooked me up that one late evening, but I was really put off by the attitude I got in the morning a couple weeks ago.

SO MUCH CANDY.  It's the size of a walgreens, and it has every brand and flavor of candy they can still order today, small quantities and bulk.  I think I have diabetes now and I don't even care.

This place is elusive. It looks like a little hole in the wall and if not for being told about it I probably would have kept driving right by, but these guys deserve some love.  Something like a hundred different bottled soft drinks plus diner style burgers and fries, sandwiches, floats (with bottled drinks if you like) and SLUSH PUPPIES does anyone else remember those?  This place is awesome. They also have a 10% off check in deal so there's no excuse not to try it.  Order a "Rocket" style (triple meat on a sub roll) and split it with someone. Get 5 bottled drinks and get the 6th free. Oh, and their cheese curds? Just like the state fair.  Wish they had a bigger location, but it looks like they are expanding to the suite next door, so that's good!

Great BBQ!  This place is easy to miss, as it is in an odd location. But it's worth the search. Some coworkers told me about this place and I love it now.   Pork, brisket, bbq baked beans, and cornbread muffins. All just amazing.   You can also get "gift certificates" (they work more like coupons really) on Restaurant.com for POAF that can take a healthy 30% off your total experience after everything is said and done (make sure you find a coupon code before buying the certificate though, there is always a promo code, just use google)  I would have to recommend taking a big party and getting the family feast deal, it's $89.99 but it feeds 8 no problem.  I will definitely be returning, if I had any complaint it would be that they close way too early. But I'm sure that has to do with their location. If they opened a new, larger place and began serving beer, they would get that 5th star from be in a heartbeat.  But still, great work!

This is a pretty awesome concept.   Take an old furniture store with a massive floorplan and fill it with about six bajillion trampolines and you've got Jumpstreet.   The kids love it and there's plenty of adults in on the fun also. There is an area for the smaller kids also. I was pretty impressed with their attention to safety in there.  It's pretty pricey, but what isn't in the world of niche family amusement establishments anymore.  They apparently also have trampoline dodgeball. Which is awesome. So, yeah, get on that.

The pizza here is pretty amazing actually. We went out of our way to try this place due to the great things we'd heard and we were definitely impressed. Their prices were pretty decent and the pie was amazing. Definitely in my top ten ever. (maybe I should start a list...)  I really wish they had more space for tables. I was disappointed that the only plausible place to sit was outside, but I understand t hat this place specializes in takeout and delivery...it's just that I live over 20 miles away so delivery is not an option for me.   But yeah, $5 medium one toppings that aren't Little Caesars? That demands some consideration.  Try them!

I was thoroughly surprised and pleased with the quality of Leo's. There is one particular chain of Hawaiian BBQ places (which will remain unnamed) that I absolutely love but they have too few locations for me to enjoy them often. I have tried other Island BBQ places in hopes of finding a substitute, but have always come out horribly disappointed...until now.  Leo's not only exceeded my expectations, but I believe their food is even better than that of the aforementioned chain which I love so much.  Leo's deserves a look. Even if it's something new for you, give it a shot. The katsu sauce is outstanding and their macaroni salad with a little soy sauce on it is out of this world.

I have been here a couple times over the past year and the quality of food and service has declined sharply.   I hope they make improvements as the reviews are declining as well, but I will be reluctant to return.  If you do visit this location, the Hibachi (Mongolian Grill) is pretty good. Pick your ingredients and they'll cook it up however you like. So if its more cost effective that going to Genghis Khan or whatever then knock yourself out.

I was very impressed. This is the best Mongolian grill I have been to so far.  A lot of people seem to be complaining about the fans and the way you have to put together your own recipe....and I don't get that. We live in Phoenix, the fans were quite welcome; and there are racks of recipe "cheat sheets" if you aren't creative or your culinary aptitude is nil.  That being said, I was thoroughly impressed with the selection of all ingredients--particularly the array of spices and sauces to choose from. The "3G sauce" as it was called if I remember correctly, is recommended highly.   Like others have said, a bottomless bowl is definitely not necessary, one bowl was more than enough. Also, they have bottled domestic beers for only $1 all day every day last time I was in, so get down on that, why not. Two beers cost me less than my friend's coke.  This place deserves a higher rating, give it a try.

I was on vacation from Arizona when I had to visit Findlay Kia to get my A/C fixed after it pretty much exploded on the road. Needed a new compressor. Luckily my vehicle was still under factory warranty and all it cost me was a day's rental (which Findlay Kia partially subsidized for me, so it only cost me $35 + insurance at Enterprise)  The whole experience was painless, after my terrible experiences earlier that day checking into my hotel and all of that I was really concerned that these guys would try to screw me over somehow but to my delight my experience was just the opposite.  Wes took great care of us and the car works great now. Can't say anything better for their service department, they were top notch for me.

This is an awesome bar that is actually pretty well hidden. I've only been there on Sunday for Karaoke with Appa (great time) but it's never been an overly crowded or rowdy place. Very friendly atmosphere.  Their street tacos are outstanding and their nachos are worthy of the establishment's namesake. They also have hard cider on tap which is my favorite, especially in a giant frosty dwarf mug.  Great food, great drinks, great service, great prices. Highly recommended.

Horrendously overpriced. ~$13 for an xlarge 2 topping that I had to bake myself? The pizza itself was better than average, but if you don't bake on location then at least make it cheaper than going to pizza hut and having it delivered to my door, ready to eat.  I'm glad I had the experience, but I don't see where the benefit to this is, at all. It isn't more cost-effective than going to the grocery for frozen pizza, and it isn't that much better than frozen.  On the plus side, the gal at the counter that made my pizzas was very nice, but it's a shame I don't see this kind of business surviving. I probably won't return, I am pretty disappointed.

First time visit on the way to a concert. We needed somewhere decent and conveniently located for lunch so we decided to give this place a try.  And I am really glad we did. wow was it good.  The restaurant itself is spacious and tables are placed with wide margins of distance between them. "Crowded" is the last word anyone would use to describe this place, even if every table was occupied. I like that very much.  The waitress was attentive and did a good job, but the food was what really surprised us. The Tavern burger exceeded my expectations, and the bacon-wrapped prawns appetizer isn't cheap, but the experience is religious.  Wasn't terribly excited by their specials so I had iced tea to drink, but the prices weren't too out of line. Easy 4 stars. Would like to return sometime at night and enjoy their very attractive semi-outdoor bar.

Quite impressed.  I wish their prices were a little lower, but The Sushi room delivers in every other way. The service is fantastic, the atmosphere is terrific, and the food is outstanding.  We had received some gift cards and couldn't wait to use them, our waiter was incredibly helpful and friendly and even gave us 10% off and comped us on a dish that was late to our table. No hesitation. I like that a lot.   They have some specials, nothing that really blew me away but some is better than none. Although they did have this garlic edamame that was rather terrific.   It's a shame that Sushi Room is a bit out of the way for us, but if you are in the neighborhood it is worth checking out. (Also be sure to stop at the Living Room next door for an after-dinner glass of wine!)

HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS GUY BEFORE.  A couple of my coworkers invited me to walk down the block to check out a food truck that had arranged to be in the neighborhood today and let's say I am glad I went.  Q-UP does everything homemade and it is all amazing. The owner was extremely polite and friendly; and I ordered the BBQ Nachos and a side of the Macaroni.  The macaroni had homemade cheese and was full of big chunks of smoked bacon. The owner suggested putting some of their BBQ sauce on it too, which was definitely good advice.   This was the best mac and cheese I have ever had.  Then came the nachos, handmade chips with pulled pork, nacho cheese, tomatoes, green onions, and topped with their homemade sauce.  I've never had a plate of nachos more heavenly.   I don't know if BBQ sauce makes everything better or if it's just this guy's. He does tacos too, but I wasn't able to try them today...next time.  My buddies and I ordered some of the smoked sausage though as an aftertought with their mustard BBQ sauce, and he gave us a sample of the brisket to try as well.  I am elated with the quality, I've never been big on street food before, but I am a believer now.  The best part? It's priced right. The mac and nachos together cost me ten bucks even, and the nachos were a nice big portion. He takes plastic also, so don't sweat the cash thing. For a food truck in the days of $5+ hot dogs, a ten spot goes a long way at Q-Up, I was impressed.  If this guy is in your neighborhood, make the trip. I was told he announces where he'll be on Twitter so you can stalk him, I mean, follow him.  Great stuff!

This is a really great place to try new things, see something interesting? Grab it off the conveyor belt and give it a shot.  The prices are good, and I am really fond of the way I can sit down and get started pretty much right away without having to wait 10 minutes before my order is taken, then another 15-20 to have it brought, you just place a drink order and grab and go.  And if there is something you don't see on the belt, just ask for it, the service for special orders is surprisingly fast.  I really with they had a more extended happy hour on the sushi, but I can't really blame them, the prices are already pretty good. I can eat here for less than most other sushi places, and I can get in and out the door in 20 minutes easily, even with the kids in tow.  Highly Recommended.

Winco is a great grocery store. I can get almost everything I need there.  This place gets a bad rap and I don't know why. Here's their angle: They don't take credit cards (but debit is OK. And it says so ON THE DOOR) and they don't hire people to bag (you just do it yourself). Then they take the savings and make their prices lower, and I don't see anything wrong with that. I don't know what they pay their employees but they certainly don't seem to be the soulless braindead wage-hostages you see at your average WalMart.  There's no pharmacy though, and their vitamin/supplement selection is kind of weak so there's still a need for me to go to Frys once in a while. But they have awesome stuff there. Tons of things you can but in bulk by the pound (Candy, rice, dog food, snacks, nuts, coffee, honey, peanut butter, and more)  We're going on a camping trip soon and we found packs of hotdogs for like 60 cents, camping-size tanks of propane for about 3 bucks, giant marshmallows, and 3ft wooden skewers for them all on the cheap.  I got a 12 pack of off-brand 5 Hour Energy for like $8 there last time too and they are just as good.   And the $2 pre-made pizza crusts...amazing deal.  I really like this place. Of course it's busy because the prices are so good, so go late. They are open 24Hrs for a reason. Haters gonna hate.

I am not big on German food, generally speaking. But this place is outstanding.  Their beer selection is fantastic and their bratwurst and burgers are very very good. Great place to go if you enjoy mustard.  But, what stole my heart is their pretzels. Let me be perfectly clear: Brat Haus serves the best Pretzels I have ever had in my entire life. I will go out of my way to come back, just to have their Pretzels. They are perfectly authentic in every day, even down to the preparation with real lye. (Something most places are afraid to do) and the rock salt they are sprinkled with. I am frothing at the mouth just thinking about it. Words cannot describe.  I'd like to give this place 4 stars due to the cramped quarters and inadequate number of restrooms, (it is a little pricey too) but really I just don't have the heart to. The food and service were too good. So 5 it is.

This is a really, really cozy little hole-in-the-wall diner and bakery that I fell in love with. They have well-priced specials and the food/service is great.   I would have loved to try their blueberry muffins but they actually ran out :(  The restaurant is a little cluttered, but if that doesn't bother you I can recommend this mom & pop restaurant highly. Try them for breakfast (obviously)

Not the kind of place I would normally go, but we visited Searsucker recently for a yelp party and I was actually very impressed with the food and service. The bartenders know their job very well and the wine selection is very good.   This is definitely one of those high-priced upscale places, but if that is what you're looking for, Searsucker manages to be elegant but not snobby.

I used to go to Goodwill all the time to look for Board Games (I am a collector) and I thought that a brand-new Goodwill would be a good place to look.  And, well, I was really disappointed. What I found were games thrown together with toys haphazardly on top of clothing racks. It was reminiscent of what I might see at an older location where the employees no longer care that uncontrolled brat children have torn into everything and destroy the toy aisle while mommy shops.  On top of that, what happened to the prices? I used to be able to go to Goodwill and get a laundry basket for two bucks tops, but when I found one at this location it was marked $9.99. I could buy a new one for less! This is just one example of many things I found horribly mispriced. I know the second-hand thing has become trendy as of late, but whoever is handling the pricing over there has clearly lost their mind.  I prefer Savers now.

The food here is outstanding, the Calimari is great and the Fig and prosciutto pizza is amazing.  We received a coupon for this place so I brought some friends and the family and it was a pretty good experience. It was Friday night, so the wait was a little horrendous but once we got seated the service was pretty good overall. Some kinks are being worked out since they opened just recently but nothing unforgivable.  We were brought an incorrect order, and the staff comped it and brought out a replacement without hesitation. This impressed me.  They have a really good special on Sundays if you have kids, two kids eat free for every one adult all day on Sunday.  I have to say though that the prices are pretty high though so know what you're in for before you go if you can check out their menu on the web.  Also, if I had any suggestions for them I'd say install some lights on the patio so people can be seated out there at night, and install some benches out front so people can sit while they wait (currently there is no waiting area indoors and nowhere to sit, this is pretty rough if you've got children)  It may sound like I have a lot to complain about but really the positive outweighed the negative in a big way so I am giving this place 4 stars. If you've been to other high-end pizza places and have been gloriously underwhelmed (Biancos) then Upper Crust is a place you are going to like.

This place seems to be getting a bad rap but really I thought it was pretty good. My only complaint was how long it took to get our order out of the drive thru, but it was a big order so I won't treat them too harshly.  Prices could be a little lower, but nothing too outrageous for a locally owned non-chain burger joint.  They do have some clever menu items (Chorizo Dog!) that my family enjoyed a lot. Their burgers were pretty good too.  It looks like they may have had some troubles early on but got them corrected. My verdict is that they deserve an honest shot.   Would return. It's not bad!

It is important to note that today was this location's grand opening. (There was another reviewer that didn't understand that, and wandered in during their private soft-opening yesterday and responded with a 1-star.)  I used to go to the Dickey's at Happy Valley before it closed a couple years back. I was very pleased to see that a new location was opening closer to home. As I suspected, the food is still outstanding. I recommend the Brisket and the Pulled Pork.   Was a little disappointed by the Potato Salad, but I like mine made with mustard, so that's kind of a coin flip anywhere you go. Also, the dining room was pretty dimly lit, but I'm sure they will work the kinks out.  I would recommend to the management to try and find a solution to streamline the ordering queue, the suite is laid out pretty awkwardly with the door to the patio crossing through the front of the line. Maybe it would be better to take orders and transactions more rapidly and bring them out to tables as they are ready as you see in other fast-casual places.  But, at the end of the day, it's great BBQ at a reasonable price. It's certainly cheaper than taking the family to famous daves or what-have-you. Self-serve ice cream cones are included free also, so it's great for kids.

I used to be a line cook in a Japanese restaurant. I know how good Asian food is supposed to taste. So I can confidently tell you; for outstanding Asian food, Good Taste House succeeds in several ways:  1) The name of the place is just delightful, I mean look at it. It's like something from a cartoon. I love it.  2) The soy sauce they include with delivery is real, naturally brewed, Kimlan soy sauce. Not that artificially colored & flavored filth that almost every other chinese place uses. I can tell the difference, and it is disgusting. Good Taste House cares about you and provides Soy Sauce that doesn't insult your palate or intelligence. (Yes. I feel that strongly about this.)  3) I can taste the slightly singe of the noodles that have been cooked fresh, in a wok, over a flame. You can't fake that flavor and after having it myself over and over for so long I didn't realize how much I missed it until we ordered from Good Taste House. It's just...correct.  4) Their delivery zone is huge. I mean, really. I was impressed.  5) Their egg rolls and spring rolls stand out from other asian delivery in a big way. I'm not sure, but they taste handmade but they could just be a higher quality. Either way, big fan.  6) Their sweet & sour sauce tastes the way I used to make it myself. In fact, everything there tastes as good as if I made it myself, at the peak of my abilities, in a restaurant, with all the proper equipment and tools readily in front of me. I can make decent Chinese food at home, but an electric range just doesn't cook the same way. This place nails it.   THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED. Well deserving of five stars.  Fair Warning: Delivery times can be a little long because of their big coverage area. Ours didn't take *that* long but I'm willing to wait for food this good to be brought to my door. (Also, come on, the building is practically a shack. They're gonna get backed up.)
