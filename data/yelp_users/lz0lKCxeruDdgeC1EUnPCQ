My friend and I have gone here for several years every week to meet up for lunch. The last month the place is so dirty. But the bathrooms are soooo filthy you can't use them. We told the manager 2 weeks ago.. No response. So today we went into the restroom and it was so bad , toilet was so discussing we could not use it. The manager just happened to come in when we were looking at it, we told her. She looked at it and said "really" I don't think so! The one toilet had bomit all inside outside etc.. She chuckled at us, gave us a your dumb look and walked out! Was telling a worker about us when we left. I am going to go by and take  pictures tomorrow and I will post.. If they don't care about this.... I can't imagine the kitchen where we can't see!'Don't go there anymore!!! GROSS!!! Also they never have olive oil.. Lame
