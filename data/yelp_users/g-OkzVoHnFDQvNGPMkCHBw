I would give 0 stars if possible.  I've been to this restaurant twice, and the most recent time was literally the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  My girlfriend and I sit down, order an appetizer and a sausage pizza.  About 15 minutes later, our pizza was delivered mistakenly to another table a few feet away from us.  As we watch the couple touching the pizza, then taking slices from it and putting it on their plates, their server realizes that they dropped the wrong pizza and takes it back to the kitchen.  OUR server then lets us know that there was a mix up and that our pizza would be out shortly.  Unfortunately, we were watching the whole time as the other server takes back our original pizza to the kitchen (which is 5 feet away from our table and in plain view), reconfigures the slices to make it look fresh, and brings back said pizza to our table, pretending as if it were a new pizza! Not only have my girlfriend and I both worked at numerous restaurants in our lives, anyone can agree that this is COMPLETELY unacceptable, not to mention very unsanitary.  However, it gets worse.  We calmly tell the server that we saw what they did and would like a new pizza, to which they comply.  A few minutes later as our new pizza is in the oven, we ask to speak to a manager.  So the manager (who also happened to be helping the server put the old pizza back on the tray and reconfigure it) comes over, and I explain to him calmly everything that happened.  I also explained to him that obviously we should not have to pay for the pizza (common sense).  At this point the manager says, "You were 100% right up until you started demanding things for free, so therefore the door is right there!"   I am honestly at a loss for words at not only how this restaurant chooses to do business and recycle food, but also how poorly we were treated by the "manager".  If these are the types of things they do in plain sight, with the kitchen just a few feet away from the dining room, one can only wonder what types of things go on that the guests don't see.    I would definitely NOT recommend this restaurant, unless you enjoy getting recycled food and then being told to leave by management after making a complaint.

Cesar, Allen, and Phil moved my girlfriend and I yesterday and we don't have any complaints! They were very thorough with the initial packing. They made sure everything was wrapped up and protected before moving anything. They were professional and speedy. They literally jogged back and forth. I would definitely use Skinny Wimp again.

LOVE THIS PLACE! My girlfriend refuses to drink any coffee except Maverick. The staff is always super friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and laid back with nice comfortable couches. Definitely recommend the iced hazelnut latte and the breakfast smoothie!
