This is some of the most disappointing, poorly prepared, blandest and over-priced sushi/sashimi I've ever had. There was a bone in my salmon sashimi. No plans to return.

I've used this shop three times now, and each time they have been courteous, reliable and honest. They never try to sell me anything I don't need, and they get the job done fast. They have extremely fair pricing they fix things right the first time. I highly recommend them!!
