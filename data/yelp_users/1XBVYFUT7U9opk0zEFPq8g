I just wanted to echo all of the reviews, great job, George, thanks. He did twice as well for half the $$ in half the time of my previous cleaner. Plus my 4 year old liked the characterature on his van. :)

Al took me in last minute and stayed open an extra hour and a half, taking out what was supposed to be cold fusion extensions, done somewhere else. (the horrible other women just glued hair to my head) A technique, Al informed me, that should not have been performed on my type of hair. Nor was it what I asked for. She must've heard the panic in my voice.  Al was gentle, kind, and understanding. She also went over other types of extensions that would be more suitable for me. Very reasonable prices. You can tell she cares about her clients.....and their hair. THANK YOU!

Sara is amazing, I got my iPad screen repaired in less than one hour for about $109.00, With the yelp discount. I got it fixed previously, somewhere else, for twice the money, and it took DAYS.....

We came here for my birthday.....nevernind which one. My boyfriend and I both had a beautiful hand crafted cocktail, neither of which, do I remember the name of, but they were both delicious. Mine was made with a housemade pineapple syrup! Do it! He had one served straight up and with champagne. I stole a sip when he went to bathroom. Delicious, but mine was better. The duck I had was cooked to perfection! The presentation was stunning. Every delectable and beautiful morsel on that plate had a delicious and esthetic purpose. The bf's hanger steak was just as beautiful. I will be back before the next birthday....

So delicious! Had the cup and half with Tuscan Soup....plenty of little delicious meatballs in that one cup! I chose the slow cooker corn beef as my half sandwich! Amazing! Boyfriend had the blue cheese burger.....looked delicious, and must have been. He usually offers me a bite but didn't this time! In all fairness, even though I offered him a bite, i didn't  share either. Very reasonable prices for high quality  food. We will be back for sure!
