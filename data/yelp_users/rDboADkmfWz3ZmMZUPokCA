This place is amazing and wonderful and all the other nice words in the dictionary!  I could spend hours in here. Everything you didn't know you wanted or needed lives in this store. I love that it's a consignment store because there's always something new! Absolutely worth checking out!

Very disappointed with the service, wait what service? They never showed for their apportionment. I sat around 8-11, actually longer. I was told they were backed up but the communication was poor. I called at 1015 and again at 230. No answer, no return call. I reached out to this company because they are endorsed by the Dave Ramsey show. I wouldn't have expected a no call no show from them.

I work in dog rescue so my car constantly smells and looks like animals live in it. Best money I've spent for car cleaning, hands down! You would never know a dog, or 4 have been in my car!  Thank you!! I would recommend them!
