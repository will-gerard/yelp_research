The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.     My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver.

What makes Ranch Market so great is that it creates a fantastic experience for its customers. When you enter through the sliding doors for the first or thousandth time, you immediately understand what Ali Baba must have felt when he uttered, "Open O Simsim". For if you've entered through my favorite entrance (the West entrance), you'll be flanked by rows of 7' glass pillars filled with bejeweled pastries for sale.  The experience only gets better from there. Truly, Ranch Market is more of a destination for me and less of a stop. Highlights for me, include but are not limited to:  - having a smoothie made for you from fresh fruit and vegetables that are both peeled and pureed for you   - a produce area that reminds you of that great farmers market where the wooden carts are pilled high with produce so fresh you can feel the earth still holding on to the vegetables  - fans dancing throughout the store with streamers hanging from their blades  - a cafateria style food service area that rivals most modern mexican restaraunts  - ceviche that both tastes like the ocean and smells like limes hanging on tree      -

You can ride your bike! Yes, that right - take your bike with you - it's awesome.

Though, I never had a friend with a grandma in Alaska, if I did, I am sure her trailer (if she lived in a trailer) would look alot like this bar. Everything tinged with a hue of grey from the years of cancer sticks being offered up with well drinks by her trucker friends and their kids. Collections of debris/life scattered around and odd papers pinned to walls - oh and weird fish tanks that are so clean they make their surroundings look even more crusty.  The staff is cool though - even if they don't really work there but have "filled in" for 20 years....they make it worth a drink.

Great tortillas and tamales served with sticky floors, scary bathrooms and regularly overflowing waste cans hurts Carolina's reputation. If they could hose the place down once in awhile, it would definately get more stars from me.

You can search high and low, near and far, and you will never find a dentist as amazing as Dr. Woodbury. His skills are world class and his team is fantastic. Katie, the hygienists, is first class. I have been a patient and a loyal fan of the office for years. I have recommended them to countless friends, family member and co-workers, all with equally impressive opinions of Dr. Woodbury and staff.  If your looking for a great dentist, check them-out!

Casey Moore's is authentic. Perhaps that is why it is so difficult for some people to appreciate it. It makes no apologies for what it is - a great, neighborhood Irish pub, next door to a college. The outside picnic tables fill with that great city mix of academics, bohemians and the 20-something black glasses crowd. Inside, crowded around the small Boston-like bar, locals fill the bar stools reminiscing about days gone by and the neighborhood gossip. The conversations alone are worth a visit.

Shady's is fun. It's small, unassuming and everyone dresses up in costumes.

It's OK. It's not great but, it's not a train wreck. It is at the low end of good for a restaurant in it's price range. The food is interesting in description and OK in taste. Actually, some items are awesome and others are just bad, averaging the total taste experience out to OK.   The plating may be one of the best qualities of Binkleys. If you are wowed by amuse-bouche on large plates, you will be tripping over yourself with praises.  The staff is polite but a little affected. Their approach is magnified by the decor/style of Binkleys which is reminiscent of a buffet style restaurant in the Midwest.   In my opinion, the five star reviews on Binkleys are using the same rating scale the reviewers use to evaluate their local burger shop. Unless your burger dinner costs you up to $250 a person (the price of my dinner), it's the wrong scale. The food+experience just is not there.   On a positive note, their bacon bourbon is delicious and worth the trip on it's own...but, stop there. If you dare proceed ahead, avoid the jerky like meat(s) and stick with seafood dishes - they are less of a jaw workout.

The AC in my X5 was failing. For most of this year, I was able to deal with it as it was just cool enough. However, when I had to roll down my windows for some of that Arizona blow-dryer in your face type wind, I decided it was time for a repair. Here's where Gene comes in. He fixed it - fast, and cost effectively.

It's taken me weeks to post this review as I've had a difficult time finding the words to express how impressed I am with the staff at the Jade Bar. Sure the view is awesome and the drinks are perfectly blended and chilled. Yet, they are each put to shame by a staff who presents each with class and style.  We attended Mixology - which can only be described as Alton Brown's dream of a class on mixing drinks. You learn not only the unique history behind each drink but receive a bountiful cupful of the joy you've just learned about.  I highly recommend hitting this class with a group of friends. We had a blast and plan to attend again

A mix match of experiences that I will have to give another try when they are not busy (as the other reviews have me convinced that we caught them on a very bad night).   Cute staff that doesn't know the menu. A kitchen that takes a long, long, long time to serve room temp entrees.  An interesting wine flight served on something that looks like a pre-historic laptop that makes cross-table conversations like a game of "Battleship". An interesting decor that makes the 30 minute wait for your check less horrible than a line at the DMV.

Et tu, Hanny's? I can forgive your average food served at room temperature because your environment shows some effort at creating style and life in downtown PHX. However, I can not forgive martini's that are so small they come with itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini's....You lost me at the drinks...

When you give 5 stars, you'd better mean it - and I do. I trusted the other Yelpers opinions and I'm glad I did, Duane is great. Yelp hasn't let me down yet and Duane won't let you down either.

I am in shock that I am the first person to write a review on this place! It is freakin amazing. Am I truly the first Yelper to discover this gem? I mean, come-on, this is Phoenix's own Art's Community Center. They offer art classes (music, photography, ceramics, pottery, glass, drawing, pastel, etc.) to both children and adults. So far this year, I have taken both a drawing/painting class and am currently in a piano class.  The location could not be any more perfect.  It's right next to Burton Barr Library in those historic brick buildings on the park. The instructors are all professional artists with degrees in the arts + they are incredibly cool people.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enrich their lives with the arts.

Drink...don't eat.   The environment, with the light rail shooting by, is definately a great place to enjoy an adult beverage. Regrettably, the only thing cooler than the environment is the food...as in the serving temperature.  Speaking of cold - I have a natural tendency to dislike any non-ice cream item served with an ice scoop (like a grade school cafeteria - sides are scooped onto your plate).
