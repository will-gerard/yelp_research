Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.  I'm not sure if Palazzo is always open "sometimes" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself.   Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people.   Also? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.

Went here last month for a book club meeting..it's way cooler than it sounds.  It wasn't all that busy, but then again-it was the early evening. I'm not sure if it picks up later at night. I had some ridiculously good Pinot Noir (the brand is escaping me right now) and ate some delicious flatbread. The server was very helpful and attentive.   Overall, the place has a very hip/chic vibe,  but still casual. It's very quiet and relaxed. Service was great and the staff was friendly & informative.

I've been here a few times now. I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this place like, right after my second visit when I got food but I digress.   Welcome Diner is a cute restaurant with plenty of picnic tables outdoors. They do have some indoor seating, but it looks to be quite tiny and every time I've been is in a group. This is the spot for nice, sunny days-I've only been here when it's cool outside so I can't say much about what it'll be like in the summer. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but not so much during the day. Since you're sitting outside, it's allowed for some pretty entertaining people watching.  The brunch here is awesome! I always get super excited when I can have biscuits and gravy (since the only animal I eat is of the fish variety). You can get biscuits with mushroom gravy!! The portion I got was huge and so dang tasty.   The drinks are awesome! Get the Hurricane..even if just for the cashier to yell "HURRICANEEEE!" when you order it... It's pretty fun and adds to the overall experience.  I will definitely be back to try their dinner options and grab another delicious cocktail.

Had to update my review to share that I had dinner here last weekend for the final day of Arizona Cocktail Week. Of course, I couldn't pass up half priced hurricanes!  I tried the Vegan Po'boy (fried avocado, kale, pico de gallo and chipotle remoulade on french bread) and it was magical...but left me wondering how the heck do you fry avocados? No, seriously??? I'm sure google will tell me later which will lead to fun experiments in the kitchen....   Customer service is top notch--everyone that works here is super friendly and the wait time for food wasn't too shabby. I really love the vibe of this place and predict many visits in the future. Day or night, this place is one of the top restaurants in Phoenix.

It is what it is, DON'T JUDGE ME.  I just moved to Central Phoenix and one of the first things I looked for was the nearest Del Taco (which I admit is pretty pathetic considering all of the great food options near my house). I used to live in Tempe and there was a location at University and Rural that I used to frequent on late nights for the longest time. Sadly, it's been closed and replaced by some random chicken place.  Went here twice the past weekend. Love those veggie burritos with the red sauce! I also tried some nachos-wouldn't really recommend it. Super fast & cheap, great for a quick lunch or dinner-which is exactly the point.

I went here last night to see Polica play. I can't believe I've never been here before, having lived in Phoenix for almost 7 years..  The venue is great for seeing bands perform in a more intimate setting. I don't think there's a "bad" spot in the house. The sound is great, there were only a few times where minor adjustments needed to be made.   It's definitely a smaller venue, so it gets crowded quick. I would suggest arriving when the doors open, as we did not and ended up waiting in a line that went outside.   The bartender working was awesome, super friendly and the service was quick! Beer was cold..always a good thing. ;)  I look forward to a return visit..I love seeing live jazz and blues musicians play and this seems like the perfect place to see it!

OK-So I'm a bit partial since my stylist @ Chopper's, Jen, is also my friend! But she's a kick ass stylist and I was pretty bored with having black hair & needed something different.  I love the way this salon is decked out. Definitely doesn't seem like what you'd expect from a Scottsdale salon. I walked in and the walls are covered in animal print which is my kind of place. Oh and I get a beer while I'm getting my hair done, thank you very much! She did an amazing job lightening my hair from black to a dark copper, and this was an accomplishment considering that my hair has been colored black for about 7 years and has only been lightened in places where I'd put red highlights in. My hair is fairly damaged from all the abuse I put it through, but Jen made my hair feel wonderful and the color was great! Go see her!!

Update-- Just wanted to clarify which Jen did my hair, apparently there's more than one! Jen Y. did my hair (her hair is always blond w/ some crazy color combo! she's tall w/ tattoos).   Anywho, she's amazinggg, go to her!

I can't say I've been here too many times, mostly because I don't eat meat. But my boyfriend had never been here before and to my surprise, they did have veggie hot dogs!   Went here on a Wednesday night before dance class (ha...suppose I can have fast food before exercising? Probably not). I got a veggie dog and fries. Service was super quick and the staff is really friendly. Either they put on a good show or genuinely enjoy working there. Added toppings to my heart's desire, even some peppers and onions which I guess were supposed to cost extra but they let me have for free ninety-nine. My only qualm is that it is cooked with the meat varieties. So if you're like offended by that sort of thing..well..I'm not even sure why you'd be eating there to begin with. It's only mildly bothersome to me. My boyfriend order a hot dog and fries as well. Our food was delicious. It's honestly one of the better veggie dogs I've had. Almost like a corn dog-type flavor. The fries were fresh and made to order.   Overall a cool Tempe mainstay that I'd recommend to get your hot dog fix. Super affordable, fast & friendly service and most importantly, good food.

I'm usually not one for shows that require assigned seating. I prefer venues that have a general admission price. However, last night I was pretty impressed with Comerica. I went to see Arcade Fire (which was amazing. If I could rate that, it'd be like a gajillion stars!), and I had no clue where my seats were in relation to the stage. I had club level seating on the far left side and I must say, those were some damn good seats! I had a great view of the stage. It was worth the few extra dollars paid to see the band play there-I get it, they required a huge venue. The acoustics were spot on as well, seats were comfortable, comparable to anything you'd sit in at a movie theater and I felt I had sufficient room to move around. Slightly disappointed with the prices of a drink-I paid $12 for a beer. I kind of expected it to be more expensive, however the beer size was a large bottle so I cant complain TOO much. Parking wise, we parked on the street. We were lucky enough to find a spot right near the venue and paid 1.50 on the meter since we arrived before 8pm.   I would definitely go to this place again IF one of my favorite bands were playing as ticket prices can get quite a bit pricey (stupid Live Nation is to thank for that.. lol).

Could this be my new favorite bar? You bet!  I've been here twice-both times were SO much fun. I had been wanting to check this place out for a while and quite happy I finally did. It's a gem in central Phoenix.   Parking is a bit sketchy--we've been lucky to get a spot in the parking lot, but that was only the first time we went. This past Friday we went and ended up parking in a lot across the street, where there was a man selling ribs straight off the grill. Random, much?   This place isn't much from the outside, but once inside-it's like you're taking to another realm. It oozes cool without being pretentious. Char's is tiny-I wouldn't be surprised if they were at over capacity on the weekends. Despite that, no one seems to be bothered by it being so crowded-I swear every person I encountered was super polite and friendly. I was offered a place to sit at the bar so I could get a drink by a nice gentleman who wanted to just go out and bust a move on the dance floor.  I've been on a Sunday and Friday-both times Soul Power was playing. They ROCK. Usually, I'm like "meh" towards cover bands, but they cover songs and make them all their own. I pretty much was dancing from the time I walked in the door until I left, pausing of course to order a drink.   Overall, a great place for drinks and live music with people from every demographic! If you're a fan of Rhythm Room, you'll probably like this place.

ISO: Great Mexican food that's quick, a hop skip & jump away and is inexpensive, but not in the "I ate 'Berto's drunk last night, and it's not the booze that left me feeling like crap"  way.  This place is pretty dive-y and at first glance, you'd think "Meh..nothing to write home about". Don't judge a book by it's cover! Mi Patio serves up classic Mexican fare with a Greek twist. The first time I got the complimentary chips and salsa, I was sold-AND might I mention that it's bottomless? We'd be halfway finished with a bowl of chips and someone would be making rounds to give us more! The margaritas are pretty standard-I'm not a huge margarita drinker but I always order one when I come here-why not? It's only $1.75. I know what you're thinking. Hold the phone! 1.75? Was it Happy Hour? NOPE..It's all the time!   Usually when I go, I've ordered the veggie burro. On my most recent visit, the special was fish tacos.. This girl is a huge fan of those! The portions here are huge-especially with the burros. I usually power halfway through because it's so good I can't stop eating and then am stuffed.  They seem to make the food at record pace and all of the ingredients taste fresh. The fish tacos I ordered were SO tasty-I had never had them with fresh taco shells..mmm mm good!! Plus the beans and rice which is always delicious. I'd probably eat here every day if I could..or if it were particularly healthy.

Great, go-to brunch spot. I've been here several times. Maybe it's because my boyfriend and I get up so late on the weekend that we never have to wait for a table?   I've tried several things on the menu that are meat free-some better than others. Love their omelettes! Yum. The Bello Bene is so-so, I'm a huge fan of portabella mushrooms but I think it was the Bourdelaise sauce that threw me off. I've ordered the quick start breakfast as well, and the only thing that irks me is getting charged extra to sub out the meat for potatoes. WTH?   I like that they have a coffee bar, an option that I have not yet taken advantage of-due to it being far too much work to think of a fancy coffee drink I would like when I'm not fully awake.   Service wise, I've never had an issue. The waitstaff is always friendly and I've never waited a really long time for food.   Overall, it's a great place to grab standard breakfast fare and I predict many more visits to BC in my future.

Orange Table is a hidden gem. I've been here several times-always on the weekend, so it's usually busy when I go. I've never experienced an issue with getting a table quickly.  Most of the time, I order an omelette. Highly recommend the garlic + mushroom or Greek, both veg friendly. Coffee is always fresh and they make a damn good mimosa. The Mexican chocolate latte is quite tasty as well, although I never order it-I just steal some of my boyfriend's. ;)  The servers are always super friendly and attentive. Last weekend, my boyfriend and I even got free gelato! Apparently they are opening a gelato + coffee place in Old Town and it was part of a promotion.   This is a good go-to breakfast spot. I will likely return as it's just a hop, skip and jump away from my house.

Scottsdale has bars on every spectrum from fancy schmance to total dive. This is a laid back dive bar decked out in Christmas lights. When I first came here, I was completely confused..but then I read the yelp reviews and realized it was just like this all of the time.   The inside bar is super tiny and every time I come, it's crowded. Outside, there's a large patio and another bar.  I've been here 5 times or so...the bartender already knows my drink order. And I don't come every day, nor every week. Bonus points for that.    Minus one star for the music. I just...I just can't. It's random..who's the DJ? Is this some effed up Pandora station? Black Sabbath played right after Katy Perry? I'm confused. But I forgive you..and I will be back.

I enjoy coming here after hiking. I've been to this location twice and both times I received great service and a delicious smoothie. I usually get dairy free smoothies and have tried the Five Fruit Frenzy and Strawberry Whirl flavors-both were very tasty. They even remade my smoothie after I clumsily dropped it on the floor within minutes of getting it!

Is this Narnia? ..No? Oh just an antique wonderland!  This place is huge. I love antique malls so much, although a lot are quite disorganized and you could come across a lot of overpriced "junk"-like who collects unopened cans of Pepsi from 1984?   This antique mall has those things, but is really organized and nice. It's one of the only malls that I've seen a great vintage clothing selection in. There's only a few sections (towards the front, left end of the mall), but a lot of the clothing is from the 50s-70s and is in great shape. There's also great vendors for jewelry and kitchenware-totally unrelated things, but that's kind of what I'm into.  I could spend hours in this place. I highly recommend to anyone who's a lover of antiques and treasure hunting, just make sure you have enough time to look through the place.

It had been a great long while since I had been to Cheba Hut. I recalled a tiny establishment with almost no places to sit and a friendly staff that took a little while to make your food but it was well worth the wait.  A few days ago, went with the boyfriend here for dinner. To my amazement, the place had been expanded! Tons more kitschy pot themed decor and a lot more tables. Plus, they serve beer now which is pretty cool. You can get a blunt and a beer, haha!    I ordered the Griefo and my boyfriend ordered the club sandwich. They used to ask you what you wanted on your sandwich as they were making it (a la Subway style) but that has since changed. The staff is very friendly and helpful, I'm glad that part hadn't changed.   Food arrived relatively quickly and wow, was my Griefo delicious! I hadn't yet experienced hemp cream cheese before because I was never brave enough to try it. The sandwich had really fresh ingredients. Boyfriend quite enjoyed his sandwich as well. Afterwards, we shared a rice krispy treat..opted for the one that had fruity pebbles and froot loops! Yum.  Stop going to Subway (where almost everything is processed-gross) or Jimmy John's (bland) already..it's not nearly as good as Cheba Hut.

This is the Pita Jungle closest to me, so I go to this location above all others. This place had me at the cool vibe when you walk in the door. LOVE the artwork as well. I like going there for dinner, the low lighting is nice. Hell, I'd go there any time of the day really.  I usually try something new every time I go. I'm not a fan of hummus, which I know is blasphemy to someone who loves that places like this.. yadda yadda whatever.   I love the woodfire pizzas, the pita crisps, and the spanokapita!! Be warned, I dont think their pizzas are meant for only 1 person. Every time I order it I end up taking half home with me.  Its a nice, laid back place to eat inexpensively and healthy!

I've been going to this shop for years, a lot of these artists have become friends of mine (I'm not biased, theres a REASON I come here-the great art and the friendly people).  Pete Vaca is one of the best artists around! He's very talented, and his color work is amazing. I have a half sleeve and thigh piece that I always get complimented on, possibly more than my other tattoos (I have more than a few). Josh Carter is a great artist as well, I have one tattoo by him, a black & gray portrait which literally was the easiest tattoo experience I've ever had.. could've been the placement or the fact that we watched Step Brothers, either way it was awesome. Eric James is amazingly talented as well, I haven't been tattooed by him personally however my boyfriend has been tattooed by him multiple times.  Go there!  There's some really well rounded artists and everyone is really easy to work with! Dont get some flash off the wall, go custom!

This is one of the nicer restaurants on Mill Ave, despite the entire restaurant being a dark maze I almost got lost in. Went here recently for a "reception style" dinner for my friend's wedding. We had reservations and had a party of 14.  Our server was certainly friendly, however I'm not sure was used to serving larger parties of people. Drinks took an awfully long time to arrive (I think 20ish minutes to wait for drinks is a little excessive). Granted, some of us ordered alcohol and I completely understand that the few that order cocktails may have to wait a little longer but they weren't really busy so I'm really not sure what was going on.   The bread they brought out while we waited for food was quite good. We ordered the sampler appetizer that came with potato skins, onion rings, and some meat that my boyfriend ate and I can't recall what it was exactly (I realize that this isn't helpful), The food took a long time to arrive. Everyone appeared to enjoy their food. The sampler app we got was pretty good but likely not the level of spectacular of  actually ordering a meal.   My main complaint is the slow service and confusion on the server's part. The manager got involved at some point and one of the older ladies in my party expressed disappointment with the potato skins being too spicy. I'm really not sure why a place would just pour hot sauce all over potato skins "just because the chef likes spicy food". I realize it says right on the menu that hot sauce and ranch come with the potato skins but under the sampler, it does not explicitly say this, causing confusion for the older lady. I had a Yelp check in deal (50% off appetizer) that I had a little trouble redeeming but thankfully cleared up quickly.   I wouldn't recommend this place for large parties. Since I don't eat meat, I can't reasonably foresee returning but I'm sure this place is great if you're wanting a nice change of pace from the typical Mill Ave restaurants. I *do* enjoy Tempe's Front Porch, which is attached to Monti's and is a much more relaxed environment-great for cocktails and people watching.

This place is amazing, how have I not been in the entire 6+ years I have lived in the valley? This place is very warm and inviting, a sharp contrast to the nearby Mill District. I went there earlier this week to have dinner with a friend. House of Tricks has a great ambiance. It's definitely a "date-night" sort of place.   We sat outside on the patio. I ordered a Manhatten Iced Tea, which ended up not being my cup of tea (no pun intended), but it was a well made drink. For an appetizer, we ordered the Artisan Cheese & Fruit plate. Delicious! Fruit and cheese plates always make me feel fancy. The presentation was great..it was like a work of art. For the main entree, I had the Sugar-Spiced Salmon with Chinese Long Beans, Mustard Sauce, Sweet Soy-Ponzu, Sticky Rice and Nori. The salmon was probably the best salmon I've ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked impeccably. The rest of the dish was just as good..oh that sauce! It was sweet with just the right amount of spice.  One drawback I have noticed-Thankfully I am now a pescitarian because the vegetarian options are quite limited. I'd suggest checking out the website before going. :)  From the looks of the other reviews, I see that the menu is seasonal, so I look forward to coming back and trying what else this place has to offer.

$3 mimosas? Way to win my heart there! This place has some of the best brunch drink specials I've seen.   I'd been meaning to go to Fez for quite some time now, can't believe I hadn't gone sooner. It's a hip restaurant right off of the light rail. The decor is very modern and open. There's a bar, lounge area and outside seating. We went here for a late Saturday brunch. It was really nice outside, so we opted to sit outdoors.   I ordered the "best egg omelette you'll ever have", spicy harissa style. It's an omelette w/ provolone cheese, spinach, tomatoes and avocado. It also comes with a field greens salad tossed in lemon vinaigrette & french baguette bread. Never do I think of eating a salad with my omelette but I gave it a go. The omelette was absolutely delicious-dare I say it might've been one of the best I've ever eaten. It was spicy but not overpowering. I'm not usually a fan of avocado but it paired well with the omelette. The salad was absolutely delicious and the bread was warm and fresh tasting.    Service was overall, pretty good. There was a few times where I waited a little longer than I would expect for water refills, and the server brought us our check by the time we decided to order another drink-which may have been our fault but that's okay.   I will definitely be back again, maybe for dinner another time since apparently they make a great veggie burger. Definitely recommend!

Oh Shady's.. how I love you. You're small, intimate and have a killer jukebox. I've frequented this bar on numerous occasions for a nightcap. I personally love the Old Fashioned, which is served the traditional way, complete with one large ice cube.   The ambiance is casual and laid back. The lighting is dim and the music loud but it's not like "I have to scream over the music to talk to my friend" loud. They have the best jukebox in Phoenix. I would recommend this for date night or a small group of friends getting together. It's a bit tough to have a large group here since the space is so small. There is an outdoor patio, but as witnessed by myself last weekend when my friend decided to throw his birthday party there--it just was a bit too much. Lest I not forget this place also has a pool table! I am terrible at pool but have enjoyed a few games here.   Shady's is the place you come to to get a classic, well made cocktail. Personally, I get the Old Fashioned with Jameson.. If you're a fan of whiskey and have not had this classic, what are you doing with your life? I do have one qualm though--they used to be the least expensive Old Fashioneds that I had come across at $6.50 but the last 2 times I've been they have been $8. I don't mind paying $8 for a well made cocktail, I just think that's quite the price jump. Unless I was being charged the wrong price the entire time..who knows. For that, I do have to knock off a star.   Overall, I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a sweet, intimate spot on a date or catching up with an old friend.

As far as locally owned coffee shops are concerned, Copper Star is definitely tops. For one, it's an old gas station cutely repurposed as a coffee shops. The decor is hip with local art covering the walls. It's quiet-most of the time there are people there hanging out on their laptops. (Which begs the question-Do coffee shops pay people to hang out on their laptops? Even the grocery store Starbucks has people hanging out!) Being someone who drinks coffee all the time, I usually opt for nothing too fancy-an iced coffee will do, thank you very much. Oh and can you add some almond milk and vanilla? The coffee here is generally quite good, however sometimes inconsistent. It might not be the coffee though-sometimes the drink just tastes like the syrup is sitting at the bottom. For that reason, I have to knock off a star. :( I still love you Copper Star! Oh and I hardly ever do take advantage of the baked goods but they're always tasty. Get the S'mores brownie if they ever have it and share it with someone so you don't go into a sugar coma.

I finally got a chance to check Harley's out, after it was recommended to me by a friend. My boyfriend and I live super close and have passed by this cute little establishment several times. We went on a Saturday night around 8-ish. The atmosphere is very cozy and romantic, with dim lighting and classic Frank Sinatra playing. This restaurant has been open under various names for over 50 years and has always been an Italian establishment. I wonder what kind of history this place has seen!  Upon entering, I noticed it was quite slow for a Saturday night--perhaps we had missed the evening rush, however I did notice that this place is only open 5-10pm most days. It was no matter though, we were starving and wanting to grab a quick bite before heading out for the evening. We were quickly seated and I ordered the house sangria. My boyfriend is not a huge wine drinker, however after trying mine, had to have some himself!   I ordered the Rigatoni Primavera and my boyfriend ordered the Penne Arribiate. While we were waiting, we were served garlic bread..which was a nice touch, but honestly seemed like an afterthought. Generally though we love bread and happily ate it. My dish was quite tasty although it had eggplant in it, which is something I have never been a huge fan of anywho. My boyfriend commented that his food tasted great and was a bit spicy.   Overall, our server was very attentive and friendly. Service was quick-since we arrived when it was a bit slower our food came rather quickly.  I would definitely go back. It's great if you're wanting classic Italian fare. I'd be interested in trying their brunch, but might need a minute to get over the high price tag! I'm sure it's worth the money. Apparently on Thursdays they do a date night special that was intriguing, $25 per couple for a 3 course meal.

I seem to be attracted to restaurants that sell fancy versions of my favorite cheap eats.. (hello Republic Ramen Noodles!).   Anywho, I decided to check out Cornish Pasty Co based on the fact that my friends seemed to go there a lot, and I had heard nothing but good things about this restaurant. Last night we went, around dinner rush. The place was packed and I didnt know it was a "seat yourself" establishment. Our server directed us all the way to the back where we shared a table with some other people. This place has a really cozy feel, its definitely not a restaurant fit for large groups of people. I went with my boyfriend and his brother. I got the Lovely Bit o' Salmon pasty, boyfriend got the Meat & Cheese, and his brother got the Cajun Chicken. We also ordered the oven chips. It took a bit to get our food, but I didn't really mind. When we finally got our order, it was well worth the wait. The Salmon pasty (filled with salmon, asparagus, red potatoes, tomatoes and spinach) was delicious.. especially that dill sauce it came with. The oven chips were amazing as well! My boyfriend and his brother absolutely loved their pasties as well. I even got to try the meat & cheese.. WOW. So good. I'm a sucker for anything cheesy!   Atmosphere wise, the place is really laid back, I liked how a lot of the people there had tattoos and I didnt feel like myself or any of the people I was with were being judged..sometimes we get treated differently just based off the fact that we have tattoos at places which is a big bummer! I did notice this place must be a hipster hangout since I saw a gaggle of them going out the back door, hahaha.   I will definitely be back, as long as I'm good on my diet the rest of the week.. hahah.

I've seen a lot of really good bands play here. I like the fact that you can hang out in the back with your drink, although it sucks that you cant take your drink with ya to the front. I get it though, all ages shows! Yeah, the sound isn't "amazing" and its a little dive-y, but the place has character and that's what I like about it. One thing I don't understand is why my beer cost the same as a whiskey sour made with Jameson.. come on. Prices aren't too expensive (I always seem to pay $6 no matter what I get). I've never been here on a normal night just to hang out, so I'm not sure if its just as busy as it is at a show. Overall a good bar & cool place to see a show.

This bar has quickly become my go-to since it's like, a 5 minute walk from my house..I can just stumble on home if I've had a few too many.   This place is really divey, and the decor is pretty comical. Pictures of teddy bears doing sports on one wall and portraits of naked ladies on the other...The vibe of the place is VERY fun. There's plenty of seating and they have a section where there's a stage for comedy and karaoke nights. And.. get this! They have GAMES! There's always something going on every night. I think they also do a night called Fancy Pants? I've been there once..not too sure it's a regular thing.  The drinks and food are great here. I can't speak for Burgers Across America (since I don't eat meat), but I've had plenty of things here..the cheese curds (omg delicious), veggie wrap and grilled cheese. Yum!   I have witnessed the 1am shirtless shots. What I have not seen are many ladies partaking in it. It's usually a lot of guys...haha.   Service is usually pretty prompt unless they are super busy. The staff is super friendly. Overall, I've never had a bad experience and I've been here several times.

I've been to both the Apache location and this one several times. Both locations are top notch.   I love coming here for a quick and healthy breakfast. The atmosphere is really laid back and the service is always great. I am a creature of habit but may I recommend the veggie breakfast burrito? Oh. My. God. It's divine. It's balanced and filling-and I feel like I'm starting my day off right. The iced coffees are so yummy, but beware of knowing what size to order... I went for the large Americano once and got a thirstbuster of espresso!   The only drawback of both locations is the parking lot, especially this one. It's quite small and hard to navigate.   Overall, I highly recommend checking this place out if you're looking for a place with healthy breakfast and lunch options & great coffee. There's something to satisfy both vegetarians and meat eaters alike!

As everyone else has said, this is a hipster mecca..if by hipster you're referring to people that love their fashion corporate. Sorry if I sound cynical?   The clothing quality is sub par at best. They are catering to kids with rich parents-they can charge that much and get away with it. You're better off shopping online and paying the same price for well constructed "hipsteresque" clothing.   Why did I give it 4 stars, you ask? The store is pretty well organized and clean. There's lots of cool things to look at, books to browse and sunglasses to try on. The music playing always puts me in the right mood to shop. I've never had a problem with customer service.  The clearance section, if you go at the right time is amazing. Would I ever pay $40 for a t-shirt that has ironic holes in it? An additional $60 for acid wash jeans that should have been left in the 90's where they belong? Let's be honest. No. But $20 for pair of Kimchi Blue heels on clearance? Steal. Even better when they have a 50% off clearance special!   I have a love/hate relationship with this store. I can't help but go in there..but I mainly stay to browse the clearance racks.

Oh Chompies, how I love you. I've been here several times and have never really had a bad experience. Sure, the wait is long-especially if you come here for brunch on the weekend but the wait is totally worth it. And hey! If you have a dog, this place is totally dog-friendly on the patio! :D  The portions are huge! Maybe it's just me, but every time I go I feel like I can maybe eat half of my meal-so you're definitely getting your money's worth. Some of my favorite things to order there are the bagel skins, tuna melt (rye and swiss-best evereverever), and the french toast. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.   The only qualm I have is when I come here for brunch and order a mimosa. The so-called "large" mimosa is a joke. It's a regular size drink you'd get anywhere else.   Overall, a great spot to grab breakfast or lunch!

I've been going to Tea Infusion for a good while now to satisfy my Chai addiction. Seriously, their Chai Lattes are so good. I've tried every variety at this point, besides the boba (which I'm not really a fan of anyway). I've also had a some of their normal teas, and honestly I don't think I've ever gotten something that I didnt thoroughly enjoy.   Overall, the customer service is good. Its not over the top friendly but being that nice is kind of annoying to me. The atmosphere is pretty chill, its a small cafe with some tables & a bar to sit at.   I see some people were saying it takes "forever" to get their tea drink, or that the tea is powdered?? Its takes a good 3-5 minutes to brew tea and then make your specialty drink, and no its not loose leaf, however you brew the tea in a tea press. Or you could perhaps buy tea bags and put your ground  tea leaves in the bags and brew it the more simple way. Teavana does something that is very similar.

Rose and Crown is a British pub located in the Heritage Square. This bar is in an old house with a huge porch and seems to be in a more quiet part of downtown Phoenix. I love the way this bar is set up with the awesome art and signs on the wall. It's definitely one of the coolest pubs I've been to. I came here with a group of friends and our server was pretty attentive for most of our visit.   Love the rotating beer selection, however didn't realize until my last visit they serve liquor too! (Duh..just duh) Oh my sweet Jameson! Their drinks are pretty standard--I'm a simple lady with simple needs, a whiskey and club soda with lime is good for me!   This place is great for groups because of the large picnic tables outside for hanging out. AND they have board games! Can't beat playing Apples to Apples on a porch with your friends.  Haven't tried the food yet--but once I do I will update my review!

I love this place, perhaps more than YC's. The food is fresh & the selection of fresh veggies is awesome. One thing those-those little bowls they give you aren't cutting it! I tend to overload on veggies and find myself making a mess & then I feel bad, like I'm the jerk the workers have to clean up after lol. I never get the same thing every time..its like an adventure! Haha. The Khanzu (I think that's what its called) sauce is the best sauce I've tried so far. I liked that you get so many choices for your starch, some are more interesting than others (spiral pasta? tortillas?).. I'll just take the brown rice please! And pass the Sriracha!   I love this place so much I ate there twice last week...or maybe its because I live like 2 minutes away & my roommate had never been. Either or, still a great place, highly recommended!!

My issue is not with the store itself, it's mostly the associates who work in the cosmetics and fragrance section. I appreciate good customer service, don't get me wrong--It's just that I can't tolerate being there for more than 5 minutes since I will inevitably be approached at least 2-3 times by different associates. Also, it seems as if they get annoyed when you take a little longer to make a purchasing decision.   I don't typically shop at Macy's-it's not really my thing but I do love high end makeup and fragrances. Unfortunately, I won't be returning here due to the overbearing sales associates.

I was so excited that I finally got to go to Sweet Republic. My boyfriend hyped it up (as he is a very avid lover of ice cream) and he was right-this place is awesome! Maybe it's the fact that they have Jameson Irish cream ice cream that's swaying me?   I ordered a double trouble sundae with one scoop of the aforementioned flavor and another of Mayan chocolate. It was so good. The Jameson flavor was a sweet cream with just a hint of whiskey flavor and the Mayan chocolate had cinnamon and chilis in it which gave it a little spice. Top that off with hot fudge, walnuts and whip cream and it was one amazing sundae. I only wish I ordered it in a waffle bowl!  I almost wish I lived closer to this place but part of me is glad I don't! I would be here all the time. The service was quick and the girls at the counter were super patient and friendly.

I feel a strong sense of deja vu since I swear I've reviewed Hanny's before. Alas, I have not.   I've been here several times since last year. I love the design of this department store turned restaurant. And the basement! The creepy dolls are so awesome. Once I got behind the gate and got a picture with the dolls... totally got caught trespassing but oh well. Worth it. The vibe is very hip and trendy, definitely a great place to impress a date.   Onto the food-I don't really eat meat so my options are limited. Every time I actually eat there though, I'm all over the Cauliflower Calabrese. It's on the appetizer menu, but I always order it as my entree. It's a spicy veggie mix of cauliflower, peppers and onion strings. So. Damn. Delicious. I've had the bruschetta, and it totally wasn't what I expected it to be since it's more of a tampenade with bread. I also had a veggie sandwich there once that was pretty tasty, I'd still pick the cauliflower dish over it any day though. I look forward to the day where more veggie or fish options are available, take note Hanny's!  Drink-wise, I usually order the Moscow Mule. Do NOT order it from the upstairs bar, they don't serve it in the copper mugs and trust that it is not the same. I also like ordering Jameson with a splash of ginger ale. The bartenders know what they're doing and make stiff drinks (at least in my experience).   As far as service is concerned, it's alright. I wouldn't say it's the greatest. I'm pretty patient though because when I go, it's normally super packed. I prefer to sit at the bar where the bartenders are more attentive & quicker.   All in all, this is a super cool lounge to hang out with and have dinner with some friends, or just a few drinks. You have my heart Hanny's.

One of my favorite spots downtown. What to drink, you ask? I exclusively only drink the whiskey berry sours there.. it's hands down one of my favorite cocktails.  Great vibe/music/seating/lighting. There's not much I don't like..heck if they served food I'd venture on downtown far more often! Monday night is free Mexican food! And it's good! Can't beat that. :D

Like other reviewers, I have a real love/hate relationship with Walmart. Some locations aren't that bad. Others, like this one, are a flipping nightmare. I really should have heeded the Yelp reviews on this location..but alas, I really needed some random home items & groceries in a pinch-apparently I am also a glutton for punishment.  Before I even walked into the store, I almost flipped out on the security guards. One was smoking right in front of the entrance-about 5 feet? And parked in front of him was a golf cart with two other guards just shooting the breeze..completely blocking the entrance from where I was coming. I had a cart and these guards couldn't be bothered to move out of the way...What do I need to do? I tried to go around but it was almost impossible.   The clientele is quintessential "People of Walmart" variety. A lot of sketchy characters, some appeared to be just hanging out as if it's a thing to do. It was really hard to find things at this Walmart. I searched for 15 minutes for a water filter with nary an employee in sight..so I gave up.   When I finally decided to end this torturous experience and check out, I noticed that there weren't any Self Checkout lanes (boo). I guess not all locations have them, so I decided to wait in one of the few long checkout lanes because apparently having more than 5 cashiers at any given point in time is unnecessary (rolls eyes). Seriously..you have like, 20 checkout lanes?!?! Maybe I'm overestimating but it is quite a lot. Our cashier was either new or just didn't really care that she was bagging our groceries haphazardly. I'm sure I could do a better job.. I mean-common sense tells you to bag like items correct? But I digress.  I hope I'm never in such a bind that I have to come here again. There's too many grocery stores around me to even excuse going.

I love Dutch Bros. Every time I go (which is almost every day), I am greeted by some of thee friendliest baristas EVER. Part of me suspects that they must have an espresso IV drip-they are just so energetic. They love chatting with their customers and are super fast at making drinks. The vibe is really laid back and casual, even with nightclub music constantly blaring. I usually order the same thing every time (coffee with soy & hazelnut) but sometimes I mix it up with a seasonal drink. I love that their coffee is Americano.   After going here, I kind of feel like I'm cheating on a lover if I go to Starbucks, and hey! They don't give you a punch card like they do at Dutch..and it's not nearly as delicious.

I've been here a few times now. Bartenders, you make a great drink. And you're nice. Until I show you my Yelp check in deal and for some reason, my check is never correct. My last two visits have been this way. The first time was an undoubtedly a mistake, but the 2nd time-not so much. I'm sorry. I know I'm not your typical uppity Scottsdale clientele-but I'm a Yelp check in addict. And if they're going to give me a deal on drinks, I'm going to use it. I get the look of annoyance upon correcting you. The last time I was there, I tried to use my check in deal. I opened a tab with a credit card, and when I went to go close it-the bartender just swiped my card without letting me know how much my tab was and also, didn't acknowledge me trying to get his attention when I tried to let him know I had a check in deal. When he gave me the tab, I let him know about it and he acted like there was nothing he could do about it because he already ran the card. Until I said I was trying to get his attention and he ignored me-then magically he could void that charge.   On a more positive note, I do like Mabel's. The atmosphere is great, it's definitely classy and upscale. The customer service is very inconsistent. I understand that when I come it's pretty busy, but you really shouldn't expect for the customer to keep a running total in their head of their tab and just run their card when they ask to close it.

Starbucks is Starbucks-mediocre at best. This particular location is just the slowest one I have been to, and the customer service is little to be desired. Maybe it's because it's a drive thru location?  One of the baristas gave me a hard time about getting soy in my coffee? He thought he was being funny but seriously.. You work in customer service, your sarcastic responses to my request are unnecessary. Also? If you're not busy, an iced coffee shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes to prepare.... Just saying. Considering the other reviews, this appears to be a recurrent issue.

I moonlight as a makeup artist (unfortunately this is not yet my full time career, but one day), and I had read about other UBS shops & how great they were for supplies. I think this is a franchise location since it has the same name as the stores in downtown PHX? Anywho, this location was closest and I've now been in there a few times. Its no Sally's (as far as organization is concerned), yet I think it gets mega points for carrying some professional grade cosmetics lines (think La Femme, Cinema Secrets, Red Cherry etc) which I cant really find anywhere else other than online. The prices are a little more expensive than what I could order online, but I figure with shipping it would probably equal out. The lady with the red hair is AWESOME. The other people that work there are really nice as well, however that lady is always working when I go in, perhaps she's the owner? She's always super helpful.   Now the biggest selling point is ladies- this store carrys Red Cherry false eyelashes for $2. So if you just like wearin' em or use them on models or both (like me), its a freakin steal and they are great. La Femme eyeshadows and blushes are only $3 and are just as good as if not BETTER than anything you could buy at Sephora. I cant say much for the quality of the hair stuff, but it seemed like they carried a lot of hair and nail supplies at great prices, so if you're a beauty queen, dont walk-run there! Or to your nearest UBS, you wont regret it! :)

My boyfriend and I went here last week for Valentine's Day. Unfortunately since we made reservations too late, we couldn't get a table until 9:30 pm. Side note: More restaurants should allow online reservations. Finding a table was a breeze.  After enjoying a cocktail at Crudo, we arrived about 15 minutes early to Beckett's Table. Much to our surprise we were immediately sat.   The inside of the restaurant is very chic & trendy, with low lighting and music playing at not too annoying of a volume. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend ordered Miss Katie's Pimm's Cup and I ordered a Flinn's Dilemma because well... it had both Jameson & Bushmill whiskeys. How can I pass that one up? Our cocktails were delicious although my boyfriend noted that mine tasted much better. It might just be a preference for whiskey over vodka though. :)  For an appetizer, we really wanted to try the fried deviled eggs. I love deviled eggs and was all about trying them fried. However, much to our chagrin they were sold out. Boo. We ordered Brussels sprouts instead. They were quite tasty, but could have been a little more caramelized? Despite my total hatred of mustard anything, the dressing was a nice addition.   For our main course, my boyfriend ordered the short ribs and I ordered the butternut squash risotto. We both really enjoyed our meals. I love butternut squash anything so I'm easy to please in that area.   Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience. Service was top notch and our food was delicious. I would definitely come back again and think this is a great choice for a date night.

Finally, I got to dine here! It was well worth the wait. I came here last Friday (2/22) to take advantage of the last day of AZ Cocktail Week. Usually this place is really busy and it's hard to get a table without a bit of a wait. Thankfully, we made reservations!   This place is so cool. The atmosphere is really hip and classy. I had been here (and Citizen R + D) a few times before but wanted to wait until I tried the food to make a review.   I had the Negroni cocktail, which was..alright. I mean, I can't really judge a drink when I've never had it before and it wasn't my cup o' tea but I'm sure if you like gin you'd enjoy it! I've had their Moscow Mule before and the Cotton Cooler (at R + D) so I'm confident in their cocktail skills.   There aren't too many veg options on the menu. There were a few things that caught my eye though-the mac n cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich. In the battle of which cheesy dish to select, I went with the grilled cheese since it seemed like a healthier option (the only healthy aspect being that it came with a field greens salad). Let me just say..this might've been the best grilled cheese I've had IN MY LIFE. This sandwich was not only melty cheese goodness, but had truffled mashed potatoes and onions on it. The salad was pretty delicious too, but the sandwich was definitely the standout.   The service was really good and our server was very informative on the menu & friendly. It was a great dining experience! And I will probably try to recreate the grilled cheese at home. It was that good.

I've been here a few times. I love that it's vegetarian friendly! I think I've ordered every vegetarian option they have, the most recent being  the Veggie Cole Turkey. I think it might be my favorite. The mock turkey they use is divine and the coleslaw & Russian dressing are so tasty!   The staff is always super friendly and the service is always quick. Prices are a little higher than what you'd pay at any other chain sub shop, but that's not really a con to the place. The quality of the ingredients make it worth the price. And you get a lot for what you pay for. A small is more than filling!   A few things I wish they would change is the fact that they use so much paper to wrap their sandwiches. It's quite wasteful and I feel like my small sandwich wrap paper takes up the entire table. Also, I really wish they would have a Veggie Bobby on the menu! I'm sure many vegetarians who eat there probably feel the same way.

I'm wrestling between 3 and 4 stars, but they had a live band playing Frank Sinatra and that's just damn romantical [yes I know I made that word up], so it gets 4.   I loved the ambiance. Low lighting, not too loud/obnoxious (aside from what appeared to be a birthday party at a nearby table). It actually wasn't as terribly busy as I would've expected for a Friday night. Perfect for a late Valentine's dinner with the boy.   The waitstaff was VERY friendly and attentive-almost too attentive. I know everyone has their preferences, but I'd prefer that the waiter not be at my table every 5 minutes. I know he was trying to be helpful in helping us decide what to order as we'd never been there before. Also, it seemed like every time I took a few sips of water, someone was coming by to top off my glass. I guess that's better than the waitstaff completely forgetting you and you feel as if you might die from dehydration. That might be a little dramatic but you know what I mean.   For drinks, we ordered what I think was called the Urban Manhattan? It was certainly a Manhattan but I can't remember if that's the correct drink name. I don't typically order this drink-but it was quite delicious.  Onwards to the food! After going back and forth between the Amazing Pasta Trio and Eggplant Torta & Butternut Squash Ravioli, I went with the trio..because HEY! It says it's amazing. In the back of my head I was thinking, "that could be an over hyped claim". My boyfriend ordered the Bucatini Amatriciana. Our server complimented on us on our outstanding choices..they really do talk up their menu items as other's have noted.  Our food arrived rather quickly. Portion size was little to be desired. I wasn't starving but.... seriously. The amount of food did not justify the price. It was delicious, don't get me wrong! I've eaten at enough upscale prices that you're not going to get a lot because you're getting quality food. I just felt as though it would be best listed as a "small plate".  It was some of the best pasta I've ever eaten, so I have to give credit where it is due. Boyfriend's Bucatini Amatriciana appeared to have a lot more to it and he said it was quite delicious-although he did feel bad for me with what little amount of food I had received. Too bad it had bacon in it, or I would've had some of his for myself.   Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience. Great waitstaff and delicious food despite the few issues I had with the place. I would go back again! I'm a pasta junkie!

I had been waiting to check out Sweet Salvage for months now but always missed when they would be open! It's a little disappointing that they're only open the 3rd weekend of the month but finally, this past Sunday I got to check this place out..and it was well worth the wait! First of all, this place is immaculately decorated! Definitely photo worthy. This past Sunday was Christmas themed and I wasn't even mad about it considering next week is Thanksgiving. I think it also was due to the combination of the free apple cider, cookies and holiday music! It's impossible to not be in the spirit. I loved browsing around and ogling at all of the beautiful furniture and trinkets. I ended up finding some vintage coupe glasses that I had been searching for and a squirrel to be used with my Christmas decorations.. Yes, the prices are a little high and it seems as though you can't put things on layaway or shop online, however this place is well worth checking out for the experience alone! I'm sure there's a treasure for everyone in that shop.

I've been here a few times, most recently for brunch! I've been meaning to try their breakfast items considering how much I love their tSoynamis and Green.   The set up is a little confusing. I didn't realize that you have to order at Nami, but have the choice of sitting there or at Green next door. We opted to sit at Green, since there's much more space. One of my friends who is a strict vegan, suggested the biscuits and gravy-and almost everyone in my party ordered it. I haven't had biscuits and gravy since going meat free a few years ago so I was pretty excited about it! I also ordered their pumpkin spice mocha. It tasted like a holiday in a cup. So, so delicious.  Our order arrived not long after we got our table at Green, so service was quite quick! Our food was quite tasty! They have the market cornered on that dish! I can't find another place that has a vegetarian friendly b&g! Even my boyfriend who is a big meat eater thought it tasted good! The scramble was alright, I think I expected it to taste more like eggs than the veggie taco meat that I make at home (we're probably using the same seasonings-who knows!) It was still good, just not what I was expecting. The potatoes were phenom! Perfectly crisp on the outside! Yum.    Looking forward to a return visit! Green and Nami are two of the best vegan spots in the area!

Cute local consignment & vintage store! The owner is super friendly and appears to always be working when I come in. The store is very bright and clean.   They sell a wide selection of used brand name clothing and also vintage. On my first visit, I found a 1950's Western inspired vintage skirt for what I can only call a steal, because it was missing a button. Easy fix!   Most of the brand names are pretty well known and are priced reasonably.   What I also love love love about this store is how they support the local art scene. They sell artwork and merch from many local artists.   Definitely recommend! You'll probably find a treasure or two. :)

Soups and sandwiches are a simple, satisfying combo. When I spotted this place in the Camelback Colonnade, I had no idea what type of restaurant it was. Since I was starving and wanted something healthier than the pizza my boyfriend kept suggesting (NYPD is always tempting).  I figured anything with the word "Cafe" in the title might have something nutritious?   Upon walking in this brightly lit restaurant, I could tell it was a chain..but I don't mean that in a bad way. Like the other reviewers, it reminded me of Paradise Bakery. They have a standard list of sandwiches and many soups to choose from and everything comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry.   The staff is super friendly and helpful, no complaints there.   I ordered the Vegetarian Sandwich and attempted to order the Cauliflower soup. Sadly, they were just about out of the soup I wanted, so I opted for mushroom instead. What I liked is the numerous amount of soups that are vegetarian friendly. (Comparatively speaking, Paradise's super delicious tomato soup isn't? Imagine my disappointment finding out that.) Anywho!  Boyfriend ordered the Asian BBQ pork and tomato basil soup. Both of our meals came out quickly and were super delicious. The vegetarian sandwich is a pretty easy peasy sandwich, tough to screw up unless you're using gross veggies.  Side note? The soda fountain is pretty cool. While I rarely drink soda, I definitely enjoy a coke here & there. They have the option of adding Italian syrups to your soda! Instant "Italian soda", if you want to call it that..they did. I don't know if I really agree.    The only "meh" part of the meal was the chocolate dipped strawberry. I didn't find it all that impressive-the chocolate had a weird flavor. It was free there, so I can't knock them too much.

This is by far, a gem of Tempe as far as consignment/vintage shops are concerned. All clothing is vintage and is priced reasonably. AND it's not all 80s, WIN!   The shop itself is tiny and the decor is awesome! All of it looks to be antique. Every time I go in, there's always punk rock music. The staff working there is friendly, but not overwhelming. They let you just shop and do your own thing, which I like. They also have a rack outside usually with things that are on sale!   Vintage shopping is pretty luck of the draw, in general. I've found some things there in great condition that unfortunately didn't fit me right, however that wouldn't hinder me from going back and trying again!   PS: They have an Instagram now, which they post new things they will be putting up for sale in the shop-if you happen to use that app. I also know they have listings up on eBay that they don't sell in the store.   If you're looking to find some unique vintage clothing and accessories, check that place out! It's way better than it's counterparts nearby.

I really, really wanted to like this place. I've only had pho one other time, and was looking forward to trying it again.  I went on a Friday night when it wasn't terribly busy. My main complaint was the service. First of all, our server kept coming back to our table, seeming like he was getting increasingly irritated that we were taking our time to order.  I ordered vegetarian egg rolls as an appetizer. I'm not sure what happened, if the server just wasn't listening to me-but he said "Buddha rolls" which I assumed was some official name for said egg rolls, so I said yes.  Apparently I had just ordered spring rolls without even realizing. Sure, that was a miss communication-however it could have easily been resolved without telling me that I didn't order egg rolls (which I had). I hate to play the customer is always right card, but in this case-I have to. I had to practically argue my way to getting my order corrected. I felt like my server was treating me as if I was just lying to be difficult.   It's really sad because our food was really good. I enjoyed my veggie pho and eggrolls. My boyfriend, who came with, enjoyed his meal as well.  When the bill came, it looked as though our server had just charged us for the spring rolls anyway in addition to the veggie rolls. My temper had already flared enough at that point so I had my boyfriend handle it. Apparently he was "going to fix our bill"..well if you were going to fix it, why didn't you do that before setting the check on the table?!?!?!   I don't predict a return visit, not at least in the near future.

This might be my new favorite place to get gelato! Ok..I don't have much experience in this department. I've only been to Gelato Spot and Angel Sweet, which are both great in their own regards.   I went there on a Sunday afternoon after wondering around Old Town. The inside is bright and open, very modern. There were 3 people working, they were friendly enough-although not over the top, which I prefer. I think they were all Italian (maybe the owners according to the other Yelp reviews?). I had my eye on the Wild Cherry flavor so I got a sample. I ended up ordering that flavor with lemon. I'm a sucker for fruit flavored gelato. I am pretty sure this is the best gelato I've ever tried. Wild Cherry had chopped up cherries in it (Mmm!!) and both flavors were creamy & complemented each other perfectly.    I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the more traditional gelato flavors. Highly recommend! :)

At 9:30 pm on a Saturday night, good dinner options were slim. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out on a whim. We arrived about 30 minutes before they were to close. We were greeted by the friendliest bartender who was super cool with us taking our time to order. I love the laid back atmosphere! They had Four Peaks Arizona Peach on tap, which I decided to try.   I went with the Port-a-Burger and my boyfriend got the Porkster. I've had a portabella sandwich at a few places, but it's usually nothing to write home about. This was the best portabella sandwich I have had in ages. Smothered in havarti cheese with lettuce, tomatoes and sprouts-all served on a delicious pretzel bun. The sweet potato tots were also quite tasty. My boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich as well, which was massive and covered with BBQ sauce.   The decor is very Hawaiian/stoner-ish. The bartender kept us entertained with stories about traveling to different cities and the owner even asked us what we wanted to listen to! It was a pretty cool experience. Food was great, atmosphere awesome and we were there past closing time. No one ever rushed us. Overall a very good experience and I look forward to coming back and having another Port-a-Burger!

"The Tale of the Nonexistent Table"  Oh Sunday morning, February 16th. You started off so well. My boyfriend and I were up early enough to go check out Squash Blossom, a place that has long been on my "To Try" list-mostly because of the allure of pumpkin pancakes. We're not typically early risers on the weekend so this was a treat.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted by two different servers who both said they'd be with us momentarily. A third person (whom I presume to be the manager) approached us to see if we'd been helped and when we said yes, muttered something along the lines of "ok, that's their job anyway".. Red flag number 1? Another girl told us that only brunch was available which was unbeknownst to us--not a criticism, we just had not seen that there was Sunday Brunch. It seemed like an awfully good deal! $10 all you can eat WITH a drink? We just decided to go with it, not knowing if we'd still be able to get the aforementioned pumpkin pancakes. Finally, we were seated and quickly served coffee and water while we grabbed some plates and ventured off into breakfast land.   Inside, there were a variety of fruits and pastries, along with some lunch items. In the outdoor area, there was eggs, breakfast meats, and an omelette station. There weren't a whole lot of vegetarian options and the omelette station (which consisted of one guy and a few skillets) seemed pretty busy. I didn't want to go into a diabetic coma from just eating tons of sugary pastries, so I opted for some eggs, potatoes, biscuit, what little fruit was available and a mini cinnamon roll. It was a bit disappointing considering their main menu appears to have a lot more veg-friendly items.   Let me just start off by saying, this food was not spectacular by any means. It was akin to a buffet at a family reunion you're forced to attend where half of the food is cold and/or burnt.   I know what you're thinking right about now.. "well Natasha, why didn't you say anything?!?" Well I would've-but notice the title of this review. Nonexistent table. NO ONE willingly would come by our table to check up on us. It seemed like our server looked right past us and attended the other tables. Even if he was supposed to be the guy that brought us our drinks, I noticed that we were the only table no server checked on at all. It was actually borderline offensive. I mean, we ran out of coffee and water for a long time and finally managed to flag someone down for a refill. The girl that gave us more coffee and water was sweet and apologized because they were so "flustered and busy". Afterwards, the man I presume to be a manager approached our table, not to ask how things were, but to ask if he could take one of our chairs for another table. Let me add that this guy has zero customer service skills. Not too sure if there's a friendly bone in this guy's body.  The boyfriend and I were a little confused at this point. The servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, there's the presumed manager being a jerk to everyone. We wondered if they were understaffed? It certainly was not *that* busy the entire duration we were there. It was also a buffet and it appeared that they had a dedicated food runner. The only responsibility of the servers would be checking on customers and making sure drinks were filled.   Finally, we were ready to leave and almost contemplated a dine n dash because the people working were *that* inattentive. I flagged down manager guy for the check and he practically scoffed at me when I said I wouldn't be paying in cash. If it's such a problem to pay with a credit card, how about becoming a cash only establishment? It seemed like even if I would've expressed my discontent for the entire experience, no one would have cared.   After reading several reviews of this restaurant, I can see that there has long been problems with getting good service here. I do see that the business owner does respond to some reviews but if the same issues are happening that were going on based on reviews from a year ago--there hasn't been much effort made in improving "based on customer's feedback".   I will NOT be returning. I suspect this restaurant only stays open because of it's close proximity of Matt's Big Breakfast, which always has a long wait on the weekends.

I had been patiently waiting for this place to open! I was super excited when they did, however a little underwhelmed by some of the reviews. Maybe I had hyped it up in my head too much? But I decided to give it a go anyway.   Went here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and was immediately sat. We were kind of lucky coming a bit later as it wasn't too busy. The decor is adorable, with bright, spring colors. Unfortunately it was too cold to dine outside, so we were sat indoors. The booths are bright green and quite roomy-I wondered what this place was beforehand? My boyfriend seems to think it used to be a sushi restaurant.    Our server was Lauren, and she was really friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered mimosas and coffee, and drinks came relatively quickly.  The menu is rather extensive with both breakfast and lunch choices. I opted to order the Scottsdale Burrito (egg whites, tomato, spinach, goat cheese and hash browns), and my boyfriend ordered the My Eggs My Way. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious!   Overall, my experience with Morning Squeeze was a good one. Although they just opened, I feel like they are a very promising restaurant. I had realistic expectations that were far exceeded by the excellent service and delicious food. Will definitely come back again!

Went here a few weeks ago, I was in need of some coffee to jolt me out of a food coma. I was immediately welcomed by live music playing! The decor of 8th Day Coffee is really artsy. I'm making an assumption it's all pieces done by local artists. There are plenty of places to sit and enjoy your magical coffee drink (yes, I said magical..I'm a caffiene addict),  The staff here is friendly and quick. The prices are reasonable. The espresso is delicious. What more can you want?

Wondered in here yesterday in search of delicious breakfast fare. Did I find it? I'd say so. I just moved to the Melrose District area and have been eager to try every breakfast place and visit all of the antique shops (but that's another story...). My boyfriend and I came here for brunch. I was immediately taken in by the super kitschy and cute decor and friendly wait staff.   I ordered Huevos Rancheros and my boyfriend ordered a 2 egg breakfast with a waffle. We both got coffee. Our food was delivered quite quickly and was super delicious. The Huevos Rancheros had the perfect amount of spiciness and I tried a bite of my boyfriend's waffle-fluffy and light. The food was fresh and tasty.   The prices are ridiculously inexpensive and the portions are quite large despite that. I've grown used to paying a pretty penny at Old Town brunch places so this was a nice change of pace.   Despite the speediness of service, my only critique was that I couldn't really tell who my server was since we had 3 different people stop by our table...also it took a bit to get a water refill that I had asked for.   Overall, this is a great place to grab a quick bite before 7th Avenue shopping adventures. I will definitely be back since I live so close!

What a cute little diner! I love Bragg's. I've been here twice now. Located in the artsier part of Phoenix, this place used to be strictly a pie factory. I can't speak for the baked goods as I have yet to try them, however the breakfast here is divine.  Order the "Bwiscuits and Gwavy"--I totally cannot bring myself to actually say it that way but do it! Not too many places serve veg friendly b & g! The take is unique--fresh homemade biscuits smothered in a creamy poblano gravy. Out of the three places off the top of my head in Phoenix that serve veg b & g, this rendition gives the others a run for their money!   Service is has been fantastic both times I've been here. The wait for the food varies, I've noticed. The first time it was pretty busy so we waited a while and this last time it was pretty quick. It's great to see that there is another awesome vegetarian choice in downtown  Phoenix!

Went here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend. I'm addicted to al fresco dining and was excited about this new addition to Mill Ave. It's connected to Monti's (which I have never been to but have heard great things about).   The ambiance is very hip and urban. The music isn't annoying which is a plus. Drinks were fantastic. I had a pomegranate mojito and it was quite refreshing. One thing I did not like was the "5 for $5 Get Your Fix" menu, which I wasn't aware prior to going was only for happy hour. There was a particular veg-friendly item that I wanted, but I was informed that they were no longer serving it. That was a bummer. I opted for the fries and quesadilla (sans meat). My boyfriend got the sliders. Our food was really good. I ordered the sweet potato and regular fries and it came with various dipping sauces (including some marshmallow concoction! Yum?) I overestimated the size of the quesadilla and realized that I got entirely too much food!   When the check came, I was a little bummed that they charged me full price for the quesadilla even though I didn't want the meat. I guess I shouldn't expect those things. I will likely be back despite that. Those fries are worth it enough for a return visit!

I've already reviewed the location on Mill Ave in Tempe, however I recently moved and this location is supa close to my house.   I love Capriotti's and was so excited that a new location opened up in Old Town a few months ago. The service is always friendly, and everyone seems happy to be there!   I've tried every one of the vegetarian selections. My favorite has to be the Veggie Turkey Cole. So, so delicious. Coleslaw and Russian dressing (which I must say is the only time I've had this kind of dressing)? SOLD. The prices are a little more expensive than other chain sub places, however a small is a whopping 9 inches. It's definitely enough to fill you up. The ingredients always taste fresh.   I also like how this is connected to an Everything Bagels, although I have yet to try them.   As with my last review, I really wish they would get a veggie version of The Bobbie already! Who do I have to talk to for this?

If I ever needed a sign that I was well overdue for an eye exam, it was at the beginning of September when my glasses conveniently broke. I had been meaning to get an exam, however since I moved to central Phoenix a little less than a year ago I totally put it off. The Oculist was the closest to me and had the most flexible hours. Brian was able to get me in on a Saturday morning the same week I called. They scored points with me before having stepped into the office!  The Oculist has a very modern and organized setup-I was immediately excited when I saw how many "retro" style frames there were to choose from. It was like Christmas for my blind self, lol. Brian greeted me with a friendly hello and it wasn't very long before I met the optician Angela. She was super nice and was very thorough. As it turned out, my previous prescription was too strong-it was only noticeable when wearing contacts but I chalked it up to being light sensitive. We did my contact lens exam and she gave me a sample pair to try which were way more comfortable and even scheduled a follow up the following weekend to see if they worked out alright! As I mentioned before, the glasses selection is spectacular! There are some really unique frames and the owners Angela and Brian are really small business minded which I really appreciate.  When my glasses came in, Brian noticed the lenses had some minor imperfections and sent them back to be corrected. It was a few week wait as a result, however well worth it since these frames are high quality. You can really tell they care about their patients! I can't recommend this place enough for all of your eye needs!

It pains me to write this review, it really does. I really wanted to like this place, I've heard amazing things about the Tempe location (which unfortunately I haven't been to) and was excited that there was a location nearby to visit. The location itself is really cute. It kind of reminds me of NCounter in Tempe.   Positives:  -It's a really cute cafe. The decor is kitschy and cute, with a huge mixer in the front. I like the overall minimalist design. -I like the fact that you order at the counter, even though in a large group it can be a little annoying to have food come out in rounds.  -I can see why people come here, for the baked goods. I got a chocolate croissant to share with my group and everyone agreed it was delicious.  -The food was pretty delicious. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's french toast and the banana caramel sauce is to die for.  Onto the unfortunate negatives:  Issue #1: The staff was inconsistent. Either they were overly friendly & attentive or couldn't be bothered. Case in point-The lady who took my order was very friendly & peppy. She was very helpful at offering suggestions and even up sold me on getting a pastry to share with my group while we waited for our food. Once we got our food, it was difficult to flag any of the staff down if we needed anything and if we were successful-it took an awfully long time to get what we asked for.   Issue #2: My friend and I ordered the exact same dish but got different amounts of food. My friend noted that she felt it was overpriced for what she was getting, but then was kind of upset to see that my order had way more potatoes than hers did. There should be a standard there, especially if it's pretty obvious we're at the same table?  Issue #3: The amount of time it took for our food to arrive. I understand if you're like crazy busy, but it was only moderate on our visit. Each of us pretty much ate our entire meal before the next person got their food. I understand we ordered separately but the timing was pretty close between orders.   Perhaps this place is experiencing growing pains? I don't know. I'd like to make a return visit, but I will probably wait a bit. Hopefully I can update this review with more stars.

I'm a fan of the Little Woody, so I was certainly looking forward to checking out the triple L last Friday night (is that cool to say? Triple L? Probably not). The atmosphere is much like it's sister-it's dark and casual. There's games to play and booze to drink which I assume could make for a loud environment but that was not the case during my visit. It was pretty chill with classic rock playing.  My boyfriend and I went during happy hour, which goes until 7. More places should seriously have happy hour until 7..not 6. We ordered beers and hummus, which was delicious! I am a huge fan of hummus--I could eat it every day. For the main course, I got the house salad and my boyfriend got the burger & fries. I'm normally not one to get a salad as my main dish--however they did not have very many vegetarian options. They do have pizza and some apps that are veggie friendly, however their sandwich selection did not. That being said, I was highly impressed and happy with my choice. The house salad had baby greens, strawberries, tomatoes, cranberries, candied walnuts, feta and balsamic dressing. The combination of flavors was amazing. I was sad when I finished it! The boyfriend enjoyed his burger and fries. I tried the fries so I can confirm they were tasty.   Our server was pretty attentive until after we got our food.. we didn't see much of him afterward. We aren't huge on people checking up on us though, so that was fine.   Overall, I really enjoyed the Linger Longer Lounge and as I understand it, this place just opened recently but my experience there was on par with an restaurant open much longer. My only caveats are that the Happy Hour menu is a little limited beer wise-I don't know if this is to promote the house lager or what, but it would be awesome if there were more choices. I also wish there had been more vegetarian options on the menu (like, a veggie burger or something)?   I would definitely recommend checking out this place if you like The Little Woody and The Vig!

I've been visiting this place since it was Turf. The name changed and so did the interior, but the business itself did not.  Firstly, the renovations are great. This place still very much is a pub....with fancy chandeliers. I'm not sure what the owner is going for. But I like chandeliers so hey, can't really complain there.  I've only been here late at night but my most recent visit was a few weekends ago. For a Saturday night, this place wasn't all that busy.   One of the major factors in making a decision as to what bar to go to is whether they serve food. Chambers does have a late night menu and is one of the only downtown bars that does. They offer standard bar fare, however as a vegetarian who was quite hungry it was unfortunate that their main dish menu had 0 vegetarian options. The only things available were on the appetizer menu and consisted of fried items/hummus. Its understandable that you wouldn't have a lot to pick from on a late night menu but I think at least offering a veggie burger might be a thing to consider in the future. According to the menu, they do have a black bean burger so I'm not sure how much trouble it would be to add that to the late night menu. I ordered the hummus which was alright.   The other issue I have is with the variety of beers and the price of said beers. I feel, just as I did with Turf--the same. It is overpriced, on average about $7-$8 for a beer that I could get a for about $5 elsewhere. I'm really into craft beer and have a fairly good grasp on how much standard local beer costs at nearby establishments. It's kind of a disappointment.   Overall, I think the bar has a great aesthetic but misses the mark where it matters-the food & drinks.
