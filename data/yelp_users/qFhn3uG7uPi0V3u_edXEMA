I absolutely love this restaurant. The first experience I had at Capital Grille was in Los Angeles at the Beverly Center. From that moment on this was my FAVORITE restaurant. The food and service at any location is superb. I always get the rack of lamb with macaroni and cheese (no lobster) and their creamy bacon corn! This food will have your mouth watering every time you think about it! I went to this particular location on Valentine's Day with my husband. Everyone from the front desk hostess to the bartender and waiter was phenomenal! To have your service just as spectacular as the food is a win win combination. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and very intimate. They have a killer wine list and your waiter will break everyone of them down for you! Capital Grille is a 5 star dining experience for sure! I recommend anyone to try it at least once!

Love this venue. Its in a great location next to the best shopping venues in Scottsdale and the theater is never crowded! You get friendly servers and a descent menu selection.   I went here for the first time with some of my girl friends to see Side Effects! Loved the movie very hot and sensual! Its an awesome spot for a date night too. I will definitely be back!

So I have to be honest I didn't stay the night but I attended a social event at the hotel. I was very pleased by the service of the staff so I wanted to share my experience. The overall feel and design of the hotel was modern, fresh, and inviting. The bar upstairs has a roof top area that opens up from a 360 degree turning large glass door. Pretty awesome! So based on the d√©cor, atmosphere, and service I would definitely stay here if the opportunity presents itself. At the least I would recommend this hotel for special events, social gatherings, meetings etc.

Joined the group just last month and attended my first event last night at Hotel Indigo. It was awesome! Great sponsors and friendly organizers. Was able to network and meet some talented new designers and stylists.

Worked here and attended as a student. My experience as a student horrible! All but one of my counselors would provide consistent information. Your counselors will change constantly due to the turnover rate or internal position changes. The number of times I was told something different from each of my counselors was unacceptable. My emails would be overlooked and concerns not addressed. Now as an employee my experience wasn't as bad. I started off in the FA department with a great team and manager. However when I transferred to another department in hopes to advance I was bamboozled by the false pretence I was hired under. My inconsistent schedule, mandatory OT and immature department heads and tone were unbearable. Even so because my initial position and experience with GCU was great I don't want my last position experience to overshadow the good. Just keep in mind as an employee the department you work in will determine your professional environment and overall experience. The admissions department is not suitable for adult professionals with a family. There is deception, lack of accountability, no flexibility, and undue stress.
