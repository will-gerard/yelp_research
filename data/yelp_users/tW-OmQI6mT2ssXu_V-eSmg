The lunch buffet is $6.50, but it is awful.  Horrendous Chinese food. I will not be returning.

I'll start by saying this... The shower head is only 5'5" high.   Pros: nice room, great view of the course from the balcony friendly staff, and Grove grille is a nice restaurant.   Cons: very crowded pool with dozens of children screaming, no stove, shared balcony, and they tie up your $100 security deposit for days after you've checked out.   I had a nice week here, but until I have children of my own, I'll look for a less family-oriented place to visit.

I've been to Kyoto about 100 times for lunch, and I've never been disappointed.  Great prices, and a very friendly staff.

$4 breakfast burritos the size of Pringles cans.  You know what you're getting yourself into when you come to this place.  I did, at least.  Super Burrito provides cheap food in obscene quantities to dudes on their lunch, people looking to sop up booze at midnight, and people who love to watch Spanish soap operas on a 10 inch flat screen.  I love Super Burrito.

Killer taco selection & happy hour.  You can't go wrong with cheap tacos & beer.

Pros: friendly staff, air conditioning.  Cons: sub-par coffee, sub-par coffee selection (only light roasts), very expensive ($4.75 for a small red eye), very slow service, and they only have simple syrup or Splenda.    This may be the most overrated place I've visited. What an awful experience. Their only redeeming quality is their friendly staff.

Cartel went from zero to hero in my heart.   They introduced me to Chemex brewing (my new personal choice), and I have had several pleasant experiences since my first visit.  Since August, their ordering system seems more intuitive, the only employees I've been encountering are very patient yet highly efficient and they've reorganized the place.    Way to go Cartel.  You've officially changed my mind.

Today was my first visit.  This guy is incredibly chill and has an awesome beard.    Pros:  $10 haircuts, very experienced barber (from our conversation I understand he's been cutting hair for 28 years), super casual friendly barber.  Cons: none unless you are looking for a fancy establishment.   This is a bare bones barber shop.  There's a room, a chair and a barber.   Go in, get an awesome haircut that's affordable from a super chill dude.
