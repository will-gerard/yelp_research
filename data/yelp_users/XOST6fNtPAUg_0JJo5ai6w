Well I love this place, is my fave coffee of all... but isn't great to study or have a conversation bcz their music is too loud, is always packed (bcz is that good) also the ambient and the style of the place is very cool, different  of what u can expect in the middle of the streets in phx central area. also the employees r very cool, know u by name and show u that care for ur order.... i will say is great specially for a weekends mornings or evening... is like a great place to meet somebody by the first time like a "relax, first date" hahaha... check it out

I heard so many good things about this place that I felt disappointed ... the only good things about it was my company what made it so worth it... the drinks so "whatever" the food nothing special and the ambient just another urban style restaurant... I don't see myself going back to it.... @ least he requested again...

Food was pretty fresh, with a mix of different cultures the taste was good, I liked how the settings were a mix from a nice trendy restaurant, but with a bunch of different things hanging all over the place, like family collections, from pictures, paint and art even to a bicycle..... that was interest. something it was not so good about it, was that music too loud and tables too close to each other, that was a turn off, since is  not a regular economic "relaxing" restaurant to go.....

Awful service today. They did fail to make the coffee the way I wanted, all I asked was for more ice, less water on my Ice Americano, to which he replied "We can't do that".... so I took off...  and after this review, the manager or owner got in contact with me in my twitter account, I thought she was going to apologize for her staff for not wanted to make an ice espresso, but instead she blamed on me, for "abruptly leave the location" all i said, "I don't want anything else, I'll go somewhere else where they can serve my coffee" that was long enough for her barista to change his mind.. And after the manager contacted me and make this about me, and not that her staff fail to make an ice espresso, and not apologize so I go back and make a better review, instead she accused me of being rude for leaving the place... Now I see where her staff gets that kind of service style. I STAY BEHIND MY FIRST REVIEW AWFUL, NO WORTH THE TRY.

The gym area is big, but has a really limited amount of machines and free weights, you get bored very soon withe same things. Is always clean, that's the good thing, But their costumer services is one of the worst, they also over charge you like instead taking you your membership every two weeks they do it twice, and they want to "pay you back" with personal training sessions, because they don't want to return the money. I canceled bcz of that. SO I WILL GIVE A BIG NO,NO,NO TO GOLD'S GYM, BAD SERVICE,  ALSO STILLING YOUR MONEY.  OH AND ON TOP OF ALL THEY OFFER DIFFERENT PRICES TO EVERYONE. SOMEONES PAY $20 BIWEEKLY OTHERS $30 AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT SOME DO $40. I DIDN'T PAY A MEMBERSHIP FEES, MY VERY GOOD BUDDY DID HAVE TO PAY $100.00 THAT'S PART OF THEIR VERY GOOD SERVICE THEY OFFER. I BELIEVE IS OUTSTANDING WHEN THEY KNOW YOU BY NAME, BUT THE ONLY REASON THIS EMPLOYEES DO IS BECAUSE THE GYM HAVE NO MORE THAN 100 MEMBERS... PROBABLY !!!
