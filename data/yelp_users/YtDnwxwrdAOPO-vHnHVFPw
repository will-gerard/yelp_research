Called ahead take out order. Stated I would be getting a smoothie when we arrived, but the woman taking my order forgot to tell me the smoothie machine was broken. As I'm consoling an upset toddler she is motioning for me to sign my cc receipt. Really, my hands are full, and my order is not even ready yet. Salad was soaked in dressing. Called back, yes all to go salads are served with dressing on them, so beware, you have to eat it ASAP or have a big soggy mess. (That's what I get for stopping at Jamba Juice on the way home)

Everything was terrific! The salsa bar had huge variety. Had the Condesa Mahi Mahi tacos, and the veggies were fresh and perfectly cooked. We had a huge party, 8 moms and 10 kids under the age of 5. (We had just toured Stuffington Bear Factory and we are a very rowdy hungry crew). They treated us wonderfully and service was exceptional. All the moms raved about the food. Next time we visit we need to leave the kids at home ;-)

Everything we have tried we have enjoyed. The Morning Monte is delicious, the marmalade really adds the extra zip. Hubby loves the cheddar biscuits with gravy. Service is always great, and we love that it is a local owned family restaurant. They treat our three year old like a princess, and she loves the birds in the courtyard.

We went to Furever Friends to look at cats and dogs and left with the most amazing experience. Although, we are not ready to bring home a new pet, I will be returning here when we are ready. We have a very senior dog and it would not be fair for us to bring home or foster at this time. Thank you for all you do in our community to bring awareness to the cause of pet rescue.

This has got to be worst Krispy Kreme. The shift manager was yelling at customers because the top row of doughnuts were not for sale, and they had no others to sell. She also stated she "could't put more doughnuts out, because the more I put out, the faster they will go." What?!   The coffee has always sucked here, and but don't bother asking for water. It's Chandler water straight from the tap. Both restrooms were out of paper towels.   I guess I'll stick with the drive-thru because eating in was not a pleasant experience.

So this was our first trip to Stuffington, and it was a blast. I knocked off a star because the location was tricky to find and not very inviting looking from the exterior it looked like a rundown abandoned building. The only sign was a vinyl banner attached the the security fence. The entrance doors were not well marked.  Look for the blue double doors on the side of the building near the parking lot.  I loved that the bears are built in the USA and it is a local business. The tour was fun. I set it up with my meet-up group and 12 moms and 15 kids attended, most kids were 5 or younger. We first sat in a room and were given a cool Q&A session and lesson on how the Teddy Bear was invented, and then we walked the production floor and saw how the bears were made. We ended the tour making our own bear to take home.  It was way less expensive than a visit to Build-a-Bear and lots more fun.

What can I say that others have not stated before. Not much, the food was awful and inconsistent. Three different moms in our group ordered cheese pizza for the kids and one order was undercooked, the other just right. The cheese tasted cheap and weird. Three out of the four kids complained. I ordered the samosa and they were greasy. Don't bother asking for mint chutney or tamarind, the staff offered me ranch and Siracha.  The place is really dirty and if you want arcade games go to Chuck E. Cheese where they don't rip you off charging two tokens for most games.  The extra star is for the staff. The guy working the front was really nice. The operator of the bungee jump trampoline was wonderful and my daughter loved it. I won't choose to return to Makutu's, even my five year old agreed. We would rather spend the day at the Children's Museum of Phx, or one of the many trampoline parks closer to home.
