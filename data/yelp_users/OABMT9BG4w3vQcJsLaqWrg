Love this place...HOWEVER (keep reading).   Very Comfortable setting.  Awesome bar!  Very friendly staff!!!   The food is great (Yes one of the best burgers around)  however I gave it 2 stars because of their draft beer prices.  They do have cheaper options like half off happy hours and PBR but if you want a good beer it's $7.50 for a pint.  The menu pricing is misleading. It says Tap Beers are $5 but when the bill came they were $7.50.  Bartender although nice didn't offer to correct the price difference.  So at $7.50 that puts it above my price point...come on it's just a beer!  If not for that I'd scored them a strong 4 stars!!!  To bad because I live just a few blocks away.  Guess I'll be hitting up Mr. Fox or Ingo for all my burger & beer cravings.

If you want a tasty fast burger this is it!  Clean and friendly service.  They even clear the table for you.  They also have some of the best sweat potato fries I've ever had!

Ok we all know this is about as good as it gets when it come to a piece of chicken between two piece of bread. Tasty!.  This location is brand new and for some reason doesn't seems as busy as most, at least not yet.  Only complaint is there's only one entrance to the parking lot which is on 44th street heading north.
