I love Jamba Juice - the smoothies anyway. It's too bad that the last couple of times I've walked into a Jamba Juice (this one or the one in Scottsdale) the combined smell of fruit, cleaning products and dirty mops really turned me off. I seriously love Jamba Juice but I'm not excited to visit one anytime soon since I had the same experience two separate instances in two separate locations. :(

Hands down one of my favorite places. The people who work there are always awesome and "on it". The food is great and I just love the atmosphere; whether it's during the day or at night with the candlelight. I also love the music they play. I always feel calm and happy here. I'd highly recommend.

I found this dentist office through Yelp and the awesome reviews were spot on! :) Dr Amy and Kristen were great!   Dr Amy was so attentive and didn't try to "sell" me on anything like other dentists in the past have. She has a genuine interest in your smile, health and helping you save money. Most "new patient appointments" are simply the x-rays, poking and prodding but they did all of the exam PLUS the cleaning all at the same appointment. To me, this was awesome and made the most sense instead of just scheduling to come back yet again just for the cleaning which is what most other dentists have done in the past in my experience.   In addition, I was able to watch "Friends" while getting my cleaning done with headphones on so I could zone out and not try to not make eye contact/have an awkward drooly conversation while they are in your mouth. Side note,  why is it that dentists want to ask you questions when they are all in your mouth? Ha!  :) That really helped take the ease off and made it a much more pleasant experience. "Friends" makes everything better after all ;) I would highly recommend Dr Amy to everyone- super nice, professional and helpful.  PS- See Dr Amy, told you I would write and happy to do so! Keep up the good work!

SOLD! To the nail spa with a relaxing and serene environment. From the moment you walk in you can sense this isn't your average nail salon. There's peaceful music, calming colors/decor and professional staff. Once you sit in the chair...gasp...It's actually very comfortable and they include a back pillow which makes a difference when you're sitting there awhile. They also have a massage therapist there to give you neck massages while you're getting your nails done if you so should choose. No its not free but what an awesome idea. Jacob did my massage and he was fantastic. I truly felt relaxed after leaving this place. To top it off you can look out the window to see the beautiful homes on the mountain and it's beautiful scenery. My only let down was that the nail tech did not massage my hands and arms with lotion after my gel mani which is something I adore. Go to this place...It's awesome! I'll definitely be a regular.

This place is right up my alley and a place I like to recommend to friends. If you like simple food, a cool/darker atmosphere and hip hop music...this is the place for you! The restaurant is actually an old house which is cool. Personally, I love it :)

I've seen a couple of the NP and Dr T at the practice and I've always been pleasantly surprised. They will actually listen to you and try to help the issue. I've been to other doctor's office where you have the what seems to be inevitable long way for your "appointment time" and then the doc comes in for about 2 mins tops to see you and is gone before I can ask all my questions. I find this is not the case here. Dr T for being the actual doc really takes his time to listen/answer your questions. I'd recommend them! I now live far away from the office (about 40 mins) but I have still make it a point to go their office.

I found D & W on Yelp and have since made them my go to for my Honda service and repairs. From the phone to in person; the guys that work there are awesome! They will even tell you if something is going wrong with the car without demanding that you get it done right away. I feel as though they are very upfront and honest - highly recommend!

I found Ann/Phoenix Glow on Yelp and the wonderful reviews were correct! Ann is fantastic and her salon is adorable! Ann does all the tans herself and is super helpful, knowledgeable and personable. There's only one tanning room so it's literally just you and Ann in the entire place which makes you feel that much more comfy when you're going to be in your birthday suit. ;-) Highly recommend! See you soon Ann!

Riding around the Tour De Tavern in Old Town Scottsdale is something you should do! Get together you and 15 of your closest friends for a ride you'll not soon forget. You get to choose the music or plug in your own and enjoy as the Old Town people stare and take pictures of you as you roll on by having the time of your life. Oh yeah and you actually get to stop at the bars of your choosing along the way! ;-) The hosts on the Tour were awesome guys. Great idea!

This place is so chill. You can bring your pups with you too! You just walk around the main dining room to the "backyard" where they have dog bowls and treats for you to use. Oh yeah and they have good food and drinks for the humans too. ;)

I actually located Rob on Yelp since that's how I pretty much how I try to find everything. :) The owner Rob was awesome and flexible from the get go. After some scheduling conflicts that arose; he even offered to come clean my couch on a Saturday or Sunday when his business is closed. Of course that wasn't necessary but what an awesome gesture on his part! He took his time cleaning my couch and even gave me a spot cleaner for future use. I was very pleased with his service and would recommend I Clean Carpets. Thanks Rob!

Let me preface this by saying I'm NEVER the type to complain or even take the time to log into Yelp to share my opinion unless it's an awesome review but this deserves to be known. My good friend decided he wanted to try Pig & Pickle as he had been referred to the restaurant by a fellow KCCO-er. He knew that taking me there may be a stretch as I am a self proclaimed "5 year old eater" but what the heck he thought. When we sat down we weren't greeted right away by our waiter but no biggie. When he did come over he asked if we had ever been there and when we said no he did a good job at explaining the culture of the restaurant and the food (cool!) Once he went to actually take our order things went down hill. I ordered first and I half jokingly asked if they had a kids menu because for me the menu was a little out there (sorry for the foodies out there (including my friend) I'm sure I'm an embarrassment ;)) I mean c'mon he didn't even crack a smile at that he just looked at me like I was an idiot and said no. I then proceeded to order the burger and when I asked for pickles (it is in the name after all) he said "It will come with a pickle on the side but not on the burger" I then ordered the fries as the side and he very condescendingly said "already knew that!" My friend proceeded to order all the wonderful things he saw on the menu and the waiter was much more responsive and welcoming to him. Once we received our appetizer, the waiter came back and proceeded to talk to my friend about the secret menu and even showed him a picture on his phone of a specialty burger so obviously this waiter takes his food seriously. Which by the way I respect totally but throughout the rest of the meal the waiter completely ignored me and only acknowledged my friend. It really made me feel like he was punishing me because I ordered the burger (which so did my friend!) but I'm just not the adventurous eater...sue me! Even my friend noticed and said I feel like I'm eating by myself because he is blantantly ignoring you. I felt so uncomfortable the entire time I was there which was disappointing because my friend was enjoying his meal but not the service. So word to the wise...if you don't like to be too adventurous with your meal choices I would not recommend this place but if you are...you'd really enjoy it since the owners are actually the cooks (pretty cool!) So there's my two cents...if you get the server by the name of Sean (which I only found out because it was on the bill the I paid) beware...he may hurt your view of this potentially awesome restaurant. I will end on a good note to say the rest of the staff was much more friendly but there's definitely a bad apple.

Josefa is simply a delight to work with. She's a professional and makes you feel very comfortable. Throughout the time I worked with her I had some major breakthroughs. She helped me see things in a different way while encouraging and supporting me throughout the entire process. Josefa is very knowledgeable and passionate about her work. I'd highly recommend her to anyone. I would absolutely work with her again in the future...and probably will! :)

Yum yum yum! Their sandwiches are so good! Think of it like Subway/Quiznos style but WAAAAYYYY better! They even have huge pickles and awesome cookies to buy too! Totally will be back to try one of their shakes as I hear those are amazing too.

My friend turned me on to the SNS manicure and I am loving it! If your used to getting gel manicures and them lasting 2-3 weeks; expect the SNS to last at least 3-4 weeks. Your nails will feel stronger and will be super shiny. This is the "next best thing" and I can't wait until SNS becomes the norm in all salons.

What a fantastic concept! You can go there with your friends or coworkers and can all choose something creative that you want to do! Everyone works at their own pace using a personal iPad with step by step instructions. You can also order wine, soft drinks, a Smore's bar and cheese/meat and cracker tray just to name a few things! The staff that work there are fantastic, friendly and helpful! Enjoy getting creative!
