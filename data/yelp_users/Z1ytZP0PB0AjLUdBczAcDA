Wonderful neighborhood feeling. The bartender Nikki is the BEST hands down. Very attentive and personable bartender, not phony like a lot of Valley bartenders. Nikki keep it up girl!

My husband and I always enjoy eating at Julio G's. The queso dip is the best.  And our absolute favorite is the Pollo Diablo fried extra crispy!  We love taking people here who are visiting from out of town and so far everyone loves it.  The restuarant stays busy with customers and I have never had to wait for a table.  I always enjoy my servers.  They always polite and informative.  Keep up the great work!

One of the Valley's best kept secrets. I got married here in September 2011 and it was amazing. This venue was the prefect mix of desert rustic and beauty. Tasha the event coordinator was a dream to work with. And the vendors were amazing. I love looking at my wedding album, definitely not your typical wedding venue. This is a great place to take pictures. We even took maternity pictures at Boojum Tree. Emily Snitzer Photography had a beautiful background for pictures. Drop by and check it out, you won't regret it.

I always enjoy going to Paradise Bakery and I usually eat there when I'm at Desert Ridge. I'm not sure if that location is going through a transition but the service had gone down. The last few times I've been there my order has been wrong and servers have to ask you multiple times to repeat your order. I was there yesterday and two orders had to be fixed while I was there. I really hope they can turn things around at that location.

So I've never really shopped at Kohl's before even though I have friends who swear by the store. I needed to do some last minute shopping for me and my family before going out of town for a wedding. Kohl's was right on the money! We were able to find something for all of us with no problem and the prices were prefect. We looked great at wedding and received compliments. Thank you Kohl's so much for your great selection of products!

I ate here for the first time today with some co-workers. Yum-meeeeee!!! The small dining room stays busy was customers coming in and out to order the delicious food. Many of the customers looked like regulars. The staff seemed to have a great relationship with the customers as they filtered in and out of the restaurant. Friendly staff that made you feel at home. I'll be going back to this place for sure!

Nice variety of food and they stay open late. I'm from Atlanta, GA where sit down restaurant stay open late. Here in Phoenix things tend to close early, unless it's a bar. My family and friends can always count on BJ's for a late night meal.   We stated coming here about four years ago when we bought our house. We met one of the servers, Jamie Harris. She's the bees knees. We always request her section if she's working. She's professional and very witty.   They make their own root beer. Yum-mee! I'm not a soda drinker and was never a root beer fan until now. It's a must have at BJ's.

I'm sad this business had to close. Great concept and great atmosphere. The valley needs a chill spot like this.

Great pizza spot! Those little squares will get you in trouble. Because in you're mind you're like "just one more piece" and then you look up and you've eaten the majority of the pizza a by yourself (not that I'm complaining or anything). They deliver which is great. On a Friday or Saturday night place your order early, they get pretty swamped on the weekends. Just writing about them makes me hungry...lol.

Love love love this place! J Chen has the best Chinese food around. Me and my family have been going there for about 4 years now. We love the staff, they are like part of the family.   While I was pregnant with my son all I wanted for a while was Chinese food. Lucky me! The staff couldn't wait to meet the baby and they are so friendly with the families that come to the restaurant. They are always so sweet to my mother and if she's not feeling well they always send her their best.   My favorite meals are the lemon chicken and pork fried rice.

I love this store. If it were any closer to my house I'm sure I would be here a lot more often. I'm a first-time mom and this is a great place because it has everything you need all in one store. I've always had a great experience with the sales people in the store. They are not pushy and they give you great information when it comes to their products so that you can make an educated decision on your own. They will even suggest other products just to give you more of an option even if you think you know what you came in the store to buy.   Not to mention it's in a great location directly across the street from Scottsdale Healthcare Shea which is where I delivered my son.

Oink definitely has a good thing going. The service is great and so is the food. Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait but trust me it's well worth waiting. Everything I have had there is good. And one of the best things to order is a bacon flight especially if it's your first time in. Enjoy!

So not only are the gas prices high at this gas station but the pumps need repairs. The PIN pads were broken in two pumps and the nozzle was out of service on another. Not what I expect from a Shell gas station in Scottsdale.

Definitely a must do in the city. I learned about Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails in Phoenix Magazine's issue in the top chef's in the valley. And Executive Chef Stephen Jones was featured in the magazine. Great atmosphere, food, cocktails and decor. My husband and I got the Partner in Dine meal special which consists of 2 small appetizers, a sandwich and a salad. I highly recommend this meal special if it's your first time. It was cool seeing Chef Jones at the restaurant. I look forward to visiting Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails again.

Visit date: 09/14/14  Can I say the best griddle cakes I have had in a long while???  This was the first for me and my husband.  We try to check out a new breakfast spot every weekend.  I had heard about Matt's from friends and read some Yelp reviews.  I glad we decided to eat at Matt's.  I know there is usually a long wait, which I was worried about since we havea six month old (teething) baby.  We went prepared to wait.  The wait was not so bad, I think we only waited about 15 minutes.    Once we were seated it did not take that long to order and receive our food.  Everything we had was delicious.  I ordered the griddle cakes, country sausage patties and home fries and my husband ordered that days special.  Everything was flavorful.  Our server was great and were in and out of there pretty quickly.    We definitely be making another trip to this restaurant!

I'm definitely glad Rochelli's has reopened. My husband and I has lunch there on Saturday. We got our fix of onion rings and pepperoni pizza. Ryan was our sever. Even though he was flying solo, managed to take care of us, a family of four and make two to go orders practically at the same time. Ryan did a great job. See you guys soon.

Thank you so much Lo-Lo's! I've been suffering from morning sickness for the past few weeks so eating has not been my favorite activity lately. After being in bed most of the day, I was craving some comfort food. And boy need y'all come through for me! Not to mention our server Bre was super sweet and professional. My two year old son also took a liking to her. He said he liked her hair and she was pretty. Y'all will probably be seeing me often.
