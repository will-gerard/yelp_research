Came in to order a barbecue feast to eat and watch game 7, however, there was not enough meat left in this joint to order a feast:(. The biggest disappointment is that I completed a huge order just to have another employee come from the kitchen and tell me, "Sorry we don't have x,y, and z." So since the bbq joint had no bbq, I ordered a hot link sandwich and left. The sandwich was average, the service was quasi-average, and the organization of this restaurant was well below average. I'm hesitant to return.

Texas sized portions cooked to perfection, my only regret is I didn't have room for desert. Best chicken fried steak in Phoenix.

I'm partial to steak and Ruth's Chris is the epitome of awesome beefy goodness. Came here for my anniversary with my wife and had an excellent time. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and surprised me and my wife with a special anniversary dessert and took a photo of the two of us. By the way, the steak was amazing, perfectly cooked, and butter soft. This is one of my favorite steakhouses in all of the land!

Very knowledgeable wait staff to help suggest wine pairings with your meal, and the food is consistently amazing from bite to bite and dish to dish. A very romantic place to take your significant other, or just an excellent place to have a terrific meal with friends. Everyone should experience this place at least once, it's that good.

Being a person of color, I understand the difficulties associated with making my hair look good and because of that I have had trouble finding a place to go and get a good haircut. This place has solved that problem. My barber had my hair looking pretty good and I was in the shop for only about half an hour. A great barbershop for blacks in the valley.

Ridiculously good barbecue. I ordered the two meat meal with brisket and rib tips with macaroni salad and bbq beans for sides. The Brisket and rib tips were excellent. Perfect smoke flavor, nice crisp "bark," and tangy sweet bbq perfectly coating the meat. The macaroni salad is amazing and the baked beans are good too.  I'm stuffed right now, yet craving more. Tom's is awesome. This is one great bbq joint, "no butts about it!"

You want pizza? They've got pizza. I always order the Sicilian pizza from this place - it is the best traditional pizza in Arizona - hands down.

Tried to stop for a quick car lunch on the way to court. 10 minutes later I'm trapped in line and still hungry. Slowest fast food in America.

Very good hot dogs. These beauties are charcoal grilled so they have that authentic family picnic taste. I ordered a footlong chili cheese dog with the bun grilled and an order of onion rings. The hot dogs were great and the onion rings were dynamite. Everything is made in front of you, so no soggy dogs here! Whenever I'm back in this area, I'll be coming to Ted's.

Just when I thought Phoenix couldn't get any more awesome, I run into this place by happenstance. A real deli that offers as many meat and bread combinations as I can conjure up? I'll accept that challenge.  So after looking over all the options on the menu, I was firmly convinced that I wanted everything... then reality set in. I ordered the combo specialty sandwich(Hot Pastrami and corned beef) on an onion roll. It was spectacular. The bread was soft and the meat was abundant, wonderfully flavored,and perfectly heated. This is my new go-to deli in the valley.

Easily the worst Sonic I've been to. I came here because Dairy Queen wasn't open and man should I have just stayed home. The employee taking our order was very rude after I corrected her when she misstated our order. Food took forever to be brought to car and my Sonic Blast(Their version of a Blizzard) was given to me with a straw(yeah, let my sip on these butterfinger chunks) and no spoon. Despite me correcting them and the food taking forever, they still managed to butcher our order. I will not return to THIS Sonic.

This place is below average. I ordered my food to go - Chile Relleno a la carte and a Chicken Chimichanga Plate Enchilada Style. Staff was friendly and my order was done fast, but the food wasn't very good. The Nachos were stale, my Chile Relleno was made with New Mexico Chiles and not the Poblano listed on the menu, lastly my Chimichanga was merely chicken - no sauce or flavor to substantiate the "enchilada style" designation.  I've sampled enough of this menu to know that I won't be back.

A very good little shop. When I entered I was greeted by a very nice man working the register, he was patient with me as he took the time to explain the menu items to me. I ended up ordering a bacon bagel sandwich and biscuits and gravy for my wife and I to split, along with a bar of fudge(It is a fudge shop after all).  The breakfast was good, but the fudge was great. I'll definitely back for lunch some time, and grab fudge from this shop every so often. Great service, great food, this is my kind of place.

This place is simply great. The steak is excellently flavored, the wait staff are all helpful and very good. The atmosphere of this place is unique as well, as the restaurant is in the oldest building in Tempe. From the outside it looks pretty small, but once inside you will see that it is huge. If you are looking for a GREAT meal that won't bust your wallet, come to Monti's - it is definitely worth it.

I am usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but this is the exception. Started off with the Italian sausage and peppers - mind was blown from there. This place is phenomenal, looks beautiful, and serves tasty food. If you are like me and skeptical about chain restaurants, give this place a try and I swear they'll change your mind!

Simply delicious. I have been wanting to try this place for quite a while and I am happy I finally did. It's easy to miss this restaurant as there is no signage on the outside, the interior is pretty dark, and there are about 3 tables and a small bar to sit at. However, the staff is great and the food is amazing. I ordered the carne adovada, Christmas style w/ fried eggs. It was divine. My wife ordered the swordfish special and it was also delicious. We both ate about 1/2 of our meals because of the humongous serving size. This place is now permanently bookmarked for me. It's awesome.

Great Chinese food in Phoenix? Well this place proved to me that it does exist. Their egg rolls are great, and they have the BEST Orange Chicken this side of the Mississippi.  Order from this place once - you will wonder why you didn't do so long ago.

I'm no cheap scape, but I know value when I see it. Here is our order:   1) Chili Sauce Chicken Dumplings 2) Hot and Sour Soup(Huge Bowl) 3)Pork Egg Rolls 4) The General's Chicken Entree(With Fried Rice) 5) Kung Pao Chicken(With Fried Rice) 6) Boba Milk Tea 7) Sprite  The total cost? Twenty-six dollars. Ridiculous. To make things better, everything was delicious, and the server was very friendly and helpful. My only regret is I didn't order off of the Tokyo Style part of the menu, but there will be another opportunity for that. With such cheap prices and great service, this place is true hidden gem.

This place is awesome. I am a huge fan of Mongolian barbecues and this place is no exception. The server was ultra friendly, the ingredients looked pretty fresh, and there are instructions for you non-veterans to Mongolian bbq. So after overfilling my bowl with an assortment of goods, I sat down and 5 minutes later the raw food became hot and delicious stir-fry. I'm definitely coming back here for sure.

This place is an arbitrage shop, a grocery store in disguise, from Macarons that are shipped from Phoenix, to "fresh" orange juice that comes from the Fry's next door(the store brand at that). Not only that, but the mislabeled items are not very good. I came here for a french macaron and in return what I got was the texture(and taste) of a stale green oreo. The egg benedict came with chip chopped ham, hollandaise out of a McCormick's package and a "fresh" salad courtesy of Fry's next door. This place is an insult to my intelligence and a disgrace to the word "bistro." I can accept places that make crappy food and own up to it, but this place masquerades as an trendy French bistro using the moniker "scratch," but my question is this "What is made from scratch inside this restaurant?" The answer is nothing. Now on my do not return list.

Food is okay, but service is way too inconsistent. Service ranges from average to well below average and there is no rhyme or reason for the inconsistency. However, I love the Tuesday night music, so I am reluctant to say I won't return, but the service here definitely gives me little reason to.

This place has superb pizza, however, it isn't very well ran. After reviewing the menu online, I called in to order and the listed specials were non-existant, also many of the items on the menu had changed(including prices). I ordered pizza and wings and the pizza was delicious, but the wings were soggy(probably frozen) and came with ultra watered down ranch dressing. If I return I won't be ordering anything other than a slice of pizza and a fountain drink because that's all it seems that they do well here.

Donuts do not exist outside of Krispy Kreme, I truly believe that. This location is the best of what this company has to offer as the donuts are made on location and it has a 24 hour drive thru. So while many Americans run on that inferior brand of "O" shaped baked goods, those coming to the Superstition Krispy Kreme get to enjoy the pinnacle of donut artistry.

Very poor experience here. I came in with a small group for lunch (there were three of us total). We all shared an appetizer, it was excellent. Unfortunately, the food is not the reason for the negative review.   It seems that this restaurant is just poorly run, the night before coming here our pickup order was refused because they didn't have time to handle a pickup order. Today, we came in for service and one waitress was handling the entire restaurant. This lead to a terrible experience- our main course was brought to us at different times, and after waiting half an hour for my burger and fries I simply told them to cancel my order.   I can tell that this restaurant is concerned with the quality of its food from what I did get to eat. It better learn to be concerned with its customers' dining experience if it wants to make it in the long run. Save yourself the time and hassle and patronize another restaurant.

Standard Arizona "Chinese" fare. I ordered takeout from this place and both dishes were soggy and bland.  The service was great and the food was ready for pickup within ten minutes, my only problem was that the food wasn't very good.

Superb! In the words of Samuel L. "That is a tasty burger."  I dined in at this location. My burger was perfect - warm bun, crisp veggies, and perfectly cooked beef. My fries were piping hot when I got them and everything was done in a reasonable amount of time despite the restaurant being slammed. Next time in the area, I will be back!

A very small establishment with very simple decor, yet extraordinary food. This place is cash only, so make sure to get some before you come. Everything is reasonably priced, I ordered Pernil with arroz con gandules and that cost $6.50. Throw in a can of soda for a dollar and we're talking about lunch w/tip for about $10. My food was excellent, it reminded me of mi abuela's cooking. And the portions were huge, so I'll be having a trip down memory lane for lunch tomorrow too! 5 stars.

Great place, great food, great people. What more could you ask for? I came here on the way to the airport to grab a burger. My meat was fresh and hot, the sourdough was buttery and soft, and my fries were perfectly golden and crisp. I'll definitely return for more.

True carnivore leaving a review here. This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, and delicious, delicious, meat-free food. I had thee argentine po boy and I wasn't disappointed. The umami taste had me doing a double take and the warm, soft roll that completed my sandwich only blew my mind some more. I'll definitely be back for more of this meat-free deliciousness!

Very good Pizza and above average wings. The pizza is great - perfectly crisp, yet chewy crust with gooey mozzarella cheese. The wings were pretty good too, I ordered Habanero Mango, the sauce was awesome but the wings were a tad dry. This pizza place is great and the delivered pizza was well preserved and not cold and soggy like many other delivery places. I will definitely be ordering from this place again.

This place is exemplary of the American Dream - from food truck to a downtown location. It also doesn't hurt that they use ribeye steak and fresh local bread for their sandwiches. I ordered the Phoenix Cheesesteak sandwich, the mixture of spice from the jalapeños and chipotle mayo, with the savory and juicy ribeye and melted cheese was amazing. I'll definitely be back.

This place has some decent barbecue. I ordered a half slab of ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, and potato salad. Everything was pretty average, with the exception of the potato salad - that was horrendous. Additionally, many menu items were either sold out or no longer available. I'm not averse to returning here, but I doubt I will anytime soon.

This place is awesome, it has a huge selection of everything and the produce section here is expansive and fresh. Although I don't come here often because I eat out way too much, if I had time to make my own meals more often, then this would be my go to spot.

This place is awesome. Open 24 hours, all the machines you could imagine, free weights as well, great staff, low monthly fee, and a safe "judgement free zone" to work out - what more could you ask for? I have dropped over twenty pounds since joining this gym and I plan to drop quite a few more here. I love this place!

Came here for a late lunch with my wife. I ordered the pork belly tacos and she ordered their chicken sandwich. The pork belly tacos were great- flavorful pork belly, crispy and fresh veggies, and tasty sauce with the perfect amount of cotija cheese. The service was pretty average and from the taste of my wife's food that I had, her dish was excellent as well. I won't go out of my way to come here, but next time I visit the gardens I'll be eating here again.
