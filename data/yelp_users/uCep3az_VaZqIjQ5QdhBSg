If your looking for a good read this is the place.  If you looking for some interesting outdated prints, this is the place.  I've found great books and paid...yup, half the price.  I've found some awesome deals on REALLY old comics for my husband and have even found a few valuable records and cook books.  I LOVE THIS STORE! If you spend more than 30$ they give you a calendar with some great coupons too!

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! The staff was courteous and attentive! We went in for some final touches for our Halloween costumes found more than expected. We shopped on a Saturday evening which seemed to be a very busy day, however the staff walked around showed each customer priority. The prices are not overly inflated and the selection is AMAZING! We can't wait to go back!

This was our first time to Haus Murphy's and the family was really looking forward to some German food and German fun. The food was decent, their sauerkraut was delicious and flavorful! My husband had their cabbage roll and enjoyed each bite! We sat on the patio and the outside ambiance was charming.  Their live music was fun, i enjoyed how they roamed around the restaurant, giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy!

Scratch- I use to love you and now I've grown complacent with you.  You were once a chic place to indulge in sophisticated pastry brought me back to the quaint French patisseries in Paris.    You now serve up little to no....comment vous faire dit (how do you say)... je ne sais quoi!   The pastries were slightly old and could have been so much more.  The bathrooms were dingy and the waitress was less than knowledgeable.  Let's hope this Saturday night visit was out of the normal.

This is a great mall that offers great store selection and easy window shopping opportunities. Its family friendly and during the summer months, the splash pad is always a kid favorite!

Yogis is a great place to get some delicious teriyaki places and they also have a pretty good spicy California roll.  The prices are good and the place is always clean.  The service is okay...the cashier can be a little nicer but all in all...I'm a total fan.

European Wax Center is a great place to get all those bits "taken care of" girls! It's clean and the wax it top notch! They offer a great monthly package and the estheticians are well trained and informed.

I really like this location.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Their "mango balls" are so good and it compliments almost any of the yogurts. Don't forget to sign up for the frequent punch card.

I ordered the "Original Italian"- provolone, ham, prosciutto, cappacuolo, salami, pepperoni! I was really good, staff was really helpful and the place was spotless! I suggest you get their red pepper relish on ANY sandwich.  It was SO good! I will be going back really soon!

This is a brand new location and it's in a pretty convenient location.  We stopped in for one of my favorite sandwiches (the Vito) and we were not let down.  The music that was playing was just as awesome as the sandwich. After trying numerous sandwich joints, Jimmy Johns is by far my favorite.  I would totally pick Jimmy Johns over the likes of Subway- Give em' a try!

Such a great little pizza place.  The prices are TOTALLY family friendly and the staff was helpful and friendly.  I ordered the veggie calzone and only paid $6.00! It totally could feed two! Their slices are cheap really good! Tasted like authentic NYC pizza! Kid friendly too! We're TOTALLY going back!
