When I want to get my English on, this is the first place I think of!!! The owner of this pub is the funniest, sweetest bar owner I have ever met! Each time my girlfriends and I go here he is always greeting us and sits down and chats! My favorite night is trivia nights on Thursday evenings. It's always fun to test you and your friend's random knowledge. The best part is, everyone in the bar participates and everyone gets into it. Not only can you enjoy great food, delicious beers and fun people, the winners of trivia get free food and drinks! How does this not sound like a great place to visit?! Just an FYI this place gets crazy around soccer, I mean football season!!! Fun place to check out!

Went here last Friday night and was very impressed. The last time I had been out to this restaurant was about a year ago and it really didn't seem too great to me, hence the reason it took me a year to come back. Im not sure if they are under new management, have a new chef, or are just improving.   Friday night was of course a busy night so we had to wait about 15 min for a table for 2, not too bad. Our server greeted us right away and we had our drinks and appetizer ordered with in minutes! I love fast service! We ordered the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapeños. I wasn't sure how different they would taste from original Jalapeño poppers, but I am so glad I ordered them! They were delicious! A mix of cheese, cream cheese and chicken stuffed in a jalapeño, then deep fried! Add the cheese dip they give you with the order and your mouth is in Jalapeño heaven! I decided on an appetizer as my main dish also, for I wanted a variety of food dishes, I ordered the Sampler Platter and SO glad I did. It comes with chicken flautas, chicken quesadillas and steak nachos. It's the sampler so it's a pretty large portion, you get a few of each item, the flautas are my favorite. The chicken had a great taste to it, mixed with the different seasoning, cheese and peppers. My bf ordered the chicken chimi, obviously you can tell we like our chicken. I tried a few bites of his dish and it was also pretty tasty. I like my chimis to be very crispy, so was a little disappointed that the tortilla on this chimi was semi crispy, when they aren't crispy they get a little soggy. It was stuffed with chicken, seasoning and peppers, not a bad combination with the rice and beans.  The staff was very friendly, courteous and quick! We had a great evening!

So to start off this review I LOVE MY VACUUM! Yes I just said that, I love my Oreck vacuum. I bought my first one back in 2008 when I bought my first house. Oreck is middle range in pricing for their vacuums depending on what you are looking for. They are WAY better than what you can buy at any Walmart or Target, but not as expensive as some of the Dyson, Rainbow or Kurby vacuums. I wanted something that was great with carpet and tile for my house had a lot of both. For me it was a pain to use 2 different vacuums or put a different piece on to go from carpet to tile to wood to carpet again. The best thing about my Oreck is it did just that with no hassle. I am able to vacuum my carpets (great suction power) and go straight to my tile by a push of a button. A lot of vacuums don't vacuum tile well for the suction isn't strong enough to get what you want off the floor, well the Oreck is! I never have to re-sweep or go over anything on my carpet or tile when I vacuum. The down side of the Oreck which could be a plus too is the fact that the wand and attachments for smaller jobs are on a completely different vacuum. So we got a standing regular vac, and a hand held smaller vac. It comes in handy when you want to just clean baseboard or curtains or stairs, but when you want to do it all at once you have to use two different vacuums.  With that being said, I try to take my vacuum in for routine check-ups once a year. It was part of my warranty package when I first bought the vacuum. It was a great investment for I wanted something that would clean my house, so why wouldn't I maintain it. Its just like having a car, you have to get the oil changes every 3,000 miles. You want your nice, awesome vacuum to keep it up. So anyway each time I bring it in I always get free tune ups and they check the bar, brushes and rollers to make sure things are top notch. I have had the vacuum for 5 years now and just now had the roller replaced! This vacuum has a lot of miles on it and it hasn't given me much trouble at all. You probably thinking ya but the roller probably set you back a pretty penny, actually it was pretty cheap and hassle free. I went in they looked at it, gave me the info about just needing a brush, installed a new brush and did the tune up and I received a call within 2 days to pick it back up! No fuss at all!  Each time I come in here, I can't help but look at the new models and try their new products out! I have yet to be disappointed! I love their vacuums and their cleaning products! They all work wonders. The staff here is very knowledgeable and very friendly each time I come in too! I definitely will be an Oreck owner for the rest of my life! Keep it up Oreck you guys can help me clean my house any day!  *I realize this is a long review about a vacuum, but I know all you women and mommies out there appreciate a great product that works, especially to get the household chores done!* Also having a product that is easy to maintain, is light weight and can be fixed at little or no cost is fantastic!    Definitely recommend spending the money, you wont be disappointed!

This is going to be short and simple! The only plus side to this place is the games and the security at the door. Other than that, its dirty, the staff is unorganized, the prices for food and tokens is pretty high and last the food is awful tasting! I don't mind spending a pretty penny on my son having a good time, but I would like a little bang for my buck. At least Peter Piper has decent tasting pizza and wings. Chuck E Cheese's has no flavor to their wings and their pizza taste like cardboard. The family packs, where you get a pizza wings and tokens, not worth it! I spent over $60 for a large pizza, wings and tokens for 4 people! Jeeeeesh!!! I think this is a no-go for us in the future.

This place is always a good time! Pretty pricey but my belly is full and I am always happy when I leave. They have a great baked potato soup, that I have to get every time I come here. It warms my soul! LOVE IT! After a bowl of soup for my appetizer I usually order a steak, loaded potatoes, chicken........ seafood... you name it they have it. The service is a little slow at times, but I have never been unhappy with my food. The steak is nice and tender, the chicken is nice and moist and their chocolate chip cookie with ice cream....... mmmmmmmm! I really never have room for it, but I cant say no, so I make room! HAHA! Keep it up Black Angus! Mmmm Mmmmm good!

They put cinnamon in their pancakes people! Cinnamon! That's all you need to know! Mmmmmmm  I think this place is cute! It's an old school cafe, themed around of course aviation. It is located right next to the Gateway Airport next to the small gift shop. If your looking for a relaxing kick back, burger and fries, or omelet and pancakes kind of joint and you are in the area, this is your place. If you get a window seat and you are a kid at heart you can watch all kinds of different planes take off and land. I have brought my son and nephew here and they have a blast eating their food and watching all the activity going on outside. The staff is polite and on the ball!  I would recommend The Whirley Bird Omelet (GET PANCAKES) or the Spruce Goose for lunch!

I swear I have left 900 reviews for this place!? I guess not!? What happened lol!? LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The family staff is so friendly, attentive and great at what they do! There hasn't been 1 time I have gone here and been dissapointed. Its a cute life cafe outside the Williams Gateway airport. You can sit inside and watch planes come and go, super neat! They have great aviator decor, great relaxed atmosphere, nice and clean, easy going kind of place. If you stop by come for breakfast! Their hint of cinnamon pancakes are delicious (way better than ihop!) They also have a very affordable breakfast buffets on the weekends.  Flightdeck - You are the reason I am fat! LOL! Your food is way too delicious to throw away, clear my plate every time, no matter what I order! Keep it up! :)

Hit and miss at this place decent food, bad service. We were seated in the bar area on a Tuesday evening, the dining room had a lot of available seating, but they sat us at those little tiny tables where you have to basically sit on top of one another and cant have a private conversation. That wasn't any fun. From there our waiter was very busy, running around like a chicken with his head cut off. We had 3 different waiters come and try to help us, it got really confusing and a bit frustrating. After 30 mins we finally got our drinks and our order in. The food was decent, but with all the waiting we ate really quick so we could get out of there and get home. My sister and I agreed it would be easier to just order our cheese cake at the to-go counter instead of ordering it through our waiter. Paid the bill after another 15 minutes of waiting got our cheese cake and got the heck out of there. It shouldn't take you almost 3 hours to eat on a Tuesday night :(

I really enjoy Kona Grill for every time I go I never seem to have a problem! Each time I go I stop and look at the beautiful fish in their large fish tanks, I always sit outside on their shaded spacious patio and the staff is always incredibly friendly. This time I ordered the Basil Pesto, which was magnificent! It's a mix of sausages, chicken, noodles and their creamy basil pesto sauce. The dish is very flavorful and exciting with a hint of spicy at the end! My son was able to enjoy the basic chicken tenders and fries which seem to always satisfy him, we were able to have a very nice lunch and each of us enjoyed our meals.  This is a great place to come for lunch or dinner; they have a great bar to sit at if you are looking to come for drinks. The inside dining area is very classy and open, and if your in the mood for being outside they have high top table and regular tables to seat plenty. This place gets crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but there is definitely a reason! Great food, great service and great drinks!

LOVE THIS PLACE! It's literally a shack, not much to look at, but don't let that fool you! I love the Mexican food here, it is scrumdidallyumpshious! Prices are cheap and you get a ton of food! My favorite is their Carne Asada Burrito! Stuff full with steak, beans, pico, guacamole.... my tummy is very happy after eating here! I got my food baby on (huge full tummy that makes me look pregnant) then I went back to work and tried to concentrate while in a bliss of food comaness! Great little spot for a quick bite!

I am blown away by this little diamond in the rough! This quaint little restaurant is tucked back in the corner of a strip mall in Mesa. I have heard a lot of whispers about this place and had to check it out myself! Absolutely amazing! The restaurants atmosphere is so peaceful and relaxing you can't help but enjoy yourself as soon as you walk through the lit court yard into the front door greeted by smiling faces. The staff is very friendly and the owners actually work here. It's owned by a husband and wife, the wife is the chef and the husband runs the front. Very promising future for this little restaurant, as for the owners love what they do and work very hard at making their customers happy. They are very caring and personable with each customer; you don't see this kind of attention in businesses now a days! They have a great menu; our food was fresh, authentic, mouth watering.... Great selection of wines....... make sure to leave room for dessert! Definitely left with my big ol food baby!! John and Shari expect to see us back very soon! Thank you for such a wonderful evening!

Not so happy, happy hour at this Applebee's.   Happy hour is awesome typically at any Applebee's, but the amount of time it took for us to get everything we ordered was disappointing. When we were first seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes to even acknowledge that we were new customers waiting to give our order. Once we ordered our drinks it took another 10 minutes to have them delivered (2 beers isn't a mix drink that a bartender has to create, right out of the tap, should have taken 5 minutes tops). When our waitress finally delivered our drinks, she ran to the table dropped the bees off and darted away, at this time we were ready to order our food and she didn't even ask us if we were ready. After flagging her down we were finally able to order our food. After about 35 minutes we flagged her down again for she had walked past our table several times and didn't give us an update about what was taking so long, nor ask us if we wanted another round of drinks. Once our food finally came out, things didnt get any better. The buffalo wings were tasty, but my steak was dry and tough. The mashed potatoes and broccoli that came along with my steak wasn't awful tasting, but also nothing special. My friend ordered a burger and said the same thing. It's just a burger nothing awesome about it but nothing nasty about it.  Im sure the kitchen gets backed up during happy hour, but that is when the waiters and waitresses should be on their toes checking on their tables to put the wait for food at ease. At this time the cooks need to make sure they still care about food quality and not worry so much about just getting the food out the door.  *Currently looking for a happy, happy hour place*

No one, of course likes writing reviews on businesses like these, but it's still a business and in the end a very much appreciated business. This family owned and operated funeral home and cemetery is very personable, caring and peaceful. I know this funeral home and cemetery well for I unfortunately have been to a few services here. Yesterday we celebrated the remembrance of my aunt at this funeral home. The facility is very nice and peaceful, it has a small calming fountain out front when you first walk in, spacious hallways for family members to gather and the actual chapel where the ceremonies are held is very pleasant. They have all the updated technology needed for slide shows and music for the ceremony, the staff is very friendly and professional and the atmosphere most importantly is calm.   The cemetery itself is very serene with beautiful grass, luscious trees, fountains, benches and beautiful columbariums. Each time I come here to visit a friend or family member I am very pleased that there are never any problems. The grounds are kept tidy, headstones are always cleaned, you are allowed to decorate the headstones and trees around your loved ones site. This funeral home and cemetery treat you and your family as if you are a family member of their own. It's nice to know that your loved ones resting place is being taken care of at all times. In the unfortunate event that you yourself have to say goodbye to someone, I would definitely recommend meeting with staff from Mountain View, they do make the process a little easier and it gives you peace of mind knowing your loved ones resting place is beautiful and tranquil at all times.

Yes please! I really like this Johnny Rockets! Every time I come here I leave with the biggest food baby! Even though this is a chain restaurant I can't get over their delicious chili cheese fries! I am a sucker for good old fashion chili cheese fries! It's nice to come to a laid back atmosphere, on any regular day and enjoy great oldies music, friendly staff, big old school burgers, chili cheese fries and an Oreo shake to wash it down with! It also helps that it's in the mall and I love to people watch! A great ending to a long day at work! Hopefully everyone enjoys an easy, quick, yummy spot like me! Remember it doesn't always have to be fancy to be great.

This place is a cute little Mexican Restaurant in Old Town. I use to come here a lot when I worked in the area, but haven't been back for a while since I moved. We visited this place last Monday night and I have to say it's as I remember it. The staff is very friendly and quick; the atmosphere gives off an old, rustic Mexican village vibe and the food isn't too shabby. The best thing about this place is their meal portions. Anything you get here is huge! You definitely have to take home left overs because there is just so much. This last visit I enjoyed the nachos, all by myself (getting my food baby on) and I took home half my platter. Of course in this case these nachos come out pilled with meat, beans, cheese, jalapeños..... on a pizza pan! Holy nachos!!! I feel the meat could have had a little better flavoring but the abundance of cheese was perfect! I love cheese on my nachos! My friend ordered their enchilada plate, along with that he got rice and beans. The enchilada was nice and spicy and the refried beans were pretty tasty. Im not a huge fan of rice, so in my book it was ok, a little dry.... But ok. The food didn't blow me away, but it hit the spot!

Bleck! Stopped here Sunday morning for a quick breakfast. We waited about 20 minutes for 2 people (understandable its a sunday morning) but ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our food, that's 30 minutes of waiting after we ordered! There was nothing good about this breakfast at all. It took forever to get our food, when it finally came out the food was cold, everything was tasteless, the sausage was burnt, the toast was burnt, the hash browns had no taste and were completely dry, the eggs were not cooked how I asked and our waitress was in her own little world.... I know Denny's isn't a fantastic place or usually at the top of my list to eat at in the first place, but we had to pass it to go where we were going, we had not had it in quite sometime, its cheap and we thought it would be simple, easy and ok. But it wasn't even ok, it was just as I said earlier.... BLECK! I wont be going back here, I will drive further to hit up an IHOP or spend some more money and hit up a local spot!  Methinks not!

DEL to the ICIOUS!!! Absolutely hands down the BEST food I have ever had!! This steak house is well known to natives and its definitely worth the pretty penny it costs to eat there! The restaurant itself is set up upstairs with a seating, bar, and patio area. The atmosphere is very romantic and peaceful. Outside you have a nice view of the sunset and inside the ambiance is very relaxing. Each employee was very courteous and respectful. I loved our waiter the most!!! We were out celebrating my birthday and he brought over a little baggy that was filled with little pieces of confetti and spread it around our table to make it a little more "birthday festive" for me. Each person who came to our table wished me a happy birthday; it was very sweet that they went out of their way to make the occasion a little more special. The food was moist, hot, and above all nothing short of perfect! The chicken I ordered was basically injected with heaven, I cant describe it any other way! My taste buds went bananas! The combination of the atmosphere, the staff, the food and the company I was dining with, the evening was fantastic! Last but not least our waiter surprised me with a free piece of their delicious chocolate cake with Happy Birthday writing. My boyfriend didn't even have to ask (Like most restaurants) they just brought it out automatically after dinner! No singing, so other guest weren't disturbed, just a Happy Birthday note with cake, it was awesome! I will definitely be going back as soon as I can (im going to start celebrating my birthday every month! HAHA!) I will be recommending it to all my family and friends! Ruth Chris keep it up!!!

I hate shopping for swim suits! I can never find anything I really LOVE! I usually order my swim suits online, but I needed something new and quick for my bday party! I am happy to say that I went to Triangles and was able to find a really cute swim suit for a decent price! I spent a good hour searching for the best match and ended up finding something I was ok with. Once I asked staff if they had different bottoms, she informed me they could send them off to be scrunched for only $10 more and would be back within a few days! After I found that out I was really happy with my purchase, it was exactly what I wanted. I love that I was able to send my bottoms off to get "scrunched" and they had them back in the store ready for me to pick up in only 3 days! It worked out perfectly! Great selection, nice staff, good prices and great customer service! Thanks for the new suit! Loving it! :)

I have been back since my last review twice and I have to say I have been quite happy with my other food choices! I have not yet had the chicken parmesan again, for I like to try other dishes. The Baked Ziti and the Spaghetti and sausage were both quite delicious. My last review wasn't a bad review a 3 star is still pretty good, but I have to say I feel better now giving it a few more tries and upping my rating to 4 stars.

I obviously have bad mooshu when it comes to comedy clubs! I attended the Ralphie May show last night with my sister. The experience altogether was not even an A-OK it was kind of like a meh.... We arrived about 40 minutes before show time just incase there was a long wait line, but to our surprise we got right in and were seated. After we sat for about 15 minutes more people were sat around us and were attended to right away by different waiters. Our waiter finally came over and gave us a menu to look at and told us he would be right with us. As he returned to take our order, his very strong personality on asking us "are you sure you don't want this?" (each suggestion was an alcoholic beverage) I finally got to a point and had to be sterner with him and repeated our original order, which indicated just drinks no alcohol. He finally backed down, took our order and went to put it into the computer system. It took quite some time for us to get our drinks, people who sat down after us, were attended to first received their drinks and their food order before we even got our drink order. My sister and I were looking around for our waiter to ask politely if we could get our drinks, when I believe a manager came up to us to ask if we needed something. I thought it was very generous that he came over to attend to us, after we spoke with him briefly our drinks finally arrived and we were able to put in our food order. We received our food order a lot faster than our drink order which was nice, but also frustrating for we got there on the early side to eat before the show, the show started as we received our food and where we were sitting we had a hard time seeing our food to be able to eat. This may not be a big deal for some, but I like to be able to see my food when I cut it so I don't spill and make a mess. My sister ordered the chicken sandwich which she was not happy with for she felt it was quite dry and tasteless; I ordered the friend cheese and wasn't blown away but not upset. The food is what you would expect out of like a small dive bar.  There wasn't much more for our server to do after our 2 drink minimum and dinner, but he was polite to check on us through out the evening. In the middle of Ralphie May's set I got a text and I needed to leave to attend to my child, so we needed to get our check so we could go. My sister asked our server for the check and he insisted that he couldn't take care of it right now that we needed to check out in the lobby area. My sister was confused and said ok and relayed the message to me. I have been to a few comedy clubs and I have never heard of that, but we thought this might be new, ok let's just get up and go out into the lobby. As soon as we both got up and left a security guard turned and looked at us as if we were trying to skip out on the check he flagged our waiter down ASAP and he came running out the door. Our server walked up and asked if something was wrong and I repeated what he said to my sister. He said there was confusion and that he would get our bill printed right away. I asked politely that we were in a hurry for I had an emergency and needed to leave. We received our bill and it was wrong, he had added a few of the alcoholic beverages from the couple that shared a table with us, so I am thinking it took such a long time to check out because he had to correct our bill. After finally receiving our correct bill and card back he handed us the papers and said "Just so you know we already have a 15% gratuity added to your bill, but I only get 10% of that so if you like to leave extra that would be great, you don't have to if you don't want to but I just wanted you to be aware." This kind of irked me the wrong way because our service wasn't great in the first place and I am a generous tipper, for I usually always leave 20% when service is good. Just the way he went about it made me feel awkward and was a little unprofessional.   On a good note when the show started it was nice to be able to hear and see the comedians. Some clubs don't do a very good job at making sure everyone has a good seat and their sound systems are not that great! Also the remodel of Tempe Improv is quite nice! They did a very good job at sprucing the place up.

This is a fun little pub! Great variety of beers, on top of a full bar (liquor) and a pretty decent menu! A group of friends and I went here and each of us were happy with everything. The loaded potato skins were just enough to fill my belly, nothing special about them, but still good. The french onion soup and clam chowder were delicious and the chicken fingers, A - OK! Next time I go I would like to try some of their famous main dishes so I can leave a better review. We kind of ate from their appetizer menu, so nothing different and exciting. The place is usually hoping on the weekends, because it is located on Mill. They have live bands, a small dance floor, inside seating and a large outside patio with tables and a full bar. The servers, bartenders and bouncers are all quite nice, its a fun atmosphere! :)

Love this hall!!! I went and saw Wicked with my boyfriend and it was AMAZING! Obviously the musical itself was fantastic, great show, great props, great stage decorations, fabulous cast.... it was all 10 stars!!! Gammage itself is very beautiful, the attendants are all very nice, informative and helpful. This place is always clean, the bathrooms are neat and the seating is done very well. Not a bad seat in the house. The only thing I would love to change is having better chairs, small complaint but I guess I am getting old! Every show I go to here I always have a hard time sitting for a few hours in the chairs comfortably to watch the show.

I love this place! It never disappoints! Every time I come here, the food is great, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very kick back. Casey's gets a bit busy on the weekends, so if you don't want to stand, I would recommend arriving earlier in the night to grab an open table! When school is out, its a lot less busy! My favorite dishes here are the Chicken Pesto and the Escargot! The Chicken Pesto has a great seasoned pesto sauce, which compliments the grilled chicken breast very well, on top of linguine noodles, served with a side of garlic bread! Its amazzzzing! I have had the Escargot twice and I am not a huge snail fan, but the sauce Casey's serves the Escargot in, makes the dish!!! Squeeze some of the lemon on top of those snails and dig in! This dish also comes with 2 pieces of their yummy bread! Last of course I can finally say I had the Oysters!!! For my first time trying these, I was super nervous I would actually spit them out, lol, but to my surprise they were pretty tasty! Our server delivered a dozen to us, on a huge ice plate! We all dug in and everyone seemed to like them! Great place to kick back with your friends, have a drink and a yummy dinner!

Mmmmmm mmmmmmm GOOD! This is a TINY place with a LONG wait..... so if you just want a regular old pizza in a couple minutes, you wont be happy visiting this restaurant. This restaurant is quite famous and everyone has wonderful things to say about it so I had to try it and put in my 2 cents.   I met a co-worker here one Friday evening (pretty busy) and I have to say that I was blown away! We were able to get a small table outside and enjoy a bottle of wine from next door, as we waited for a table. If you're not in a rush and enjoying your company, the wait of 45-60 minutes shouldn't be a problem. As we were seated, yes you notice that you are a little crammed but if you can get over that fact and enjoy a quant little authentic different place to eat you will enjoy yourself.   The pizza is cooked brick oven style, has thin crust and is a little burnt around the edges..... OLD SCHOOL! The pizza sauce and the fresh topping make this pizza yummylishious! I liked that it was thin crust, not full of grease and wasn't your normal pepperoni or olive pizza! Fresh basil leaves, round fresh sausages..... just FRESH! Everyone who worked there was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The menu isn't huge, but they have a variety of pizza, salad and appetizers to choose from. They are also pretty quick with getting the pizzas out, so once you have waited for your table, there is not too bad of a wait to get your drinks and food.  I would recommend this place for more adults on a date night then families. It is family oriented, but it's so small having larger groups is harder for them to accommodate. If you don't want to wait very long I would say try visiting this place on a week night, before the dinner rush. I enjoyed Bianco's and will definitely drive the 40 minutes again to have dinner here!

Went to Vegas for the weekend to see Dane Cook, we decided to stay at the Monte Carlo because of the price and the location. The price is decent for a nicer hotel in Vegas; it all depends on how much money you want to spend. If you want to go cheap you go with Hooters or Excalibur, if you want to pay a decent amount of money you are looking at Monte Carlo, TI or NYNY. If you wanna go big, you're looking at The Bellagio, or Phoenician. Everyone is different, everyone has different taste and everyone has a different amount of money to spend in Vegas, that is why Vegas is so awesome to go to, so many options for everyone! I really enjoyed staying at this particular hotel this time because of its location. I felt like it was somewhat in the center of everything! Not too far down the strip one way! Also anytime I rode the bus, there was a stop about 10 feet from the front of the Monte Carlo, so when I was tired and didn't want to walk, hopped on the bus and took me straight to my hotel, five seconds later im in the casino of the Monte Carlo. Not only do they have a great casino, the restaurants they have are a nice variety to choose from, along with a nice variety of fast food! Having everything you need in one place is awesome in Vegas because you do tend to get a tad lazy sometimes. The rooms were nice, clean, smell free and the beds were pretty comfy! The lobby is beautiful, their convenient store carries anything you would need and the pool is pretty awesome. They have a lazy river, a wave pool, a normal pool and a hot tub! You name it Monte Carlo has it!  Very happy with the service, the set-up, the décor, the price, the room, casino, food, all of it! When I go back to Vegas this maybe my go-to hotel!

Made another trip out to Yard House last night and had a better experience. It was pretty hoping for a Wednesday night, but we were seated right away. Our waiter was very attentive, our food came out at the same time, our order was correct and everything was good! This time I ordered the Caribbean chicken, it was nice and spicy, full of flavor with lots of different peppers. My friend ordered the Fried Chicken again and that was of course still delicious (recommend this dish). My original review wasn't bad, I just know that sometimes things happen, so it was nice to know that I was correct that things happen every now and then and this is not Yard House's norm! Definitely redeemed themselves! Good food, great staff, nice place!

This place is hit and miss! I have gone here twice in the last few months and im still up in the air about it. The first time the deep dish pizza was delicious! Tasted great, came out before they said it would (was worth the 45 min wait time told to us) waiter was on point and it was a good time. This last time I went with my sister it was a mad house (was a Tuesday night). People were coming and going, really loud, everyone standing inside because it was too hot to wait outside for a table, waiters running around running into each other dropping food. A lot of tension and pressure in the air for some reason. After we sat down we had 2 waitresses that were trying to be attentive but were not very good at it. They apologized a lot and we were there over 2 hours for 1 deep dish pizza and a cookie pizza to go. When the pizza came out, it was tasteless, bland and just blah. The stuffed mushrooms..... I dont even know how to describe those. They looked great and I feel had a lot of potential especially with the sausage and cheese...... but nope very bland and boring. Close to being done we ordered the pizza cookie to go, 3 apologizes later from both waitresses we finally got our bill and the cookie and left. It could have been an off night for everyone im not sure. But really not sure if I would go back. Sometimes the food is worth the wait and hassle, but after this visit im thinking Barros will take care of my pizza cravings. :/

This park is beautiful! My son and I just had a photo session here and it has some amazing backgrounds for pictures. The lake, waterfalls, bridges, trees, it has a little bit of everything. It has a cute little "play" area for children, it has a carousel, a train that travels through the park, little boats and a tiny ferris wheel. You do have to buy tickets to ride the rides, but it's not too expensive. You can get a sheet of tickets for like $16 and that is enough to go on all the rides a few times! It is a cute little place to take your little ones. It is quite large so there is enough space for anything you're looking to do. There was a huge birthday party on one side while we were there and a wedding going on on the other side. I will definitely be going back to enjoy an afternoon with my little fella!

Had some work done on my car and am very happy with the service at this shop. There are a lot of shops to choose from out there and this one is now at the top of my list for my regular services. It nice to be able to take your car to a business and have the correct work done on it and not feel like your being hounded to have a lot more unnecessary work done. Each employee was very nice, specific, helpful and knowledgeable. Going to a shop where you feel comfortable and are not breaking the bank is a win win! A few other perks is their nice little waiting area, it has a TV, free coffee, water and wifi while you wait. Definitely recommending this shop to everyone!

Had to get a same day printer for my office (my old one died on me) The associates here were able to find the printer I needed and held it for me until I could drive down and pick it up. Everyone was very nice, it was quick, simple and easy! Thanks so much for getting me a new printer and sending me on my way in minutes! You guys saved the day for me at work!

Alrighty Sonic..... I have given you a few chances, because all of the other Sonics I go to I am pretty happy with. When its lunch time and I want something quick and easy you are usually one of my choices! This Sonic happens to be not too far from my work and home, but I will no longer be visiting..... I will drive out of my way to spend my money somewhere else. Not only have I gone here 3 times and been un happy with the food, the service...... is beyond ridiculous. Most Sonics are employed with younger high school kids...... lets get them to get their acts together specifically at this location. Each of my visits has ended with awful customer service, or just plain bad food. This last visit was the last straw for me! Throwing food out through the drive though window is unprofessional and rude, being rude and a smart patooty (yes I just said patooty) is also not appreciated and frankly absurd since your job at the drive through is customer service!!! These kids should be happy to have a job at all in this economy. After experiencing that I get to work to eat my food and..... YUCK is all I can say! The foot long chili cheese coney I received was inedible, I attached a wonderful picture of me picking through the hot dog as for the whole thing looked like this.... decide for yourself if you would eat it.  Needless to say I am pretty hangry and cant wait to get off work and enjoy fast food from any where else but Sonic.

I don't even know where to begin. The only reason they get 1 star is because the lady at the front desk was very nice, and the technicians were nice people..... they just did an awful job on my car. This review is on their job they actually performed on my car.  I was in an accident about 2 weeks ago now. My insurance company recommended this shop, looked through Yelp's good reviews, thought this seemed like a good shop,  lets get this started. The shop took my car in the day after the accident, gave me an estimate and it was approved by my insurance. Process was super easy, quick, and no headaches. A week later my baby is ready to be picked up. When I get there, you can see that the front bumper doesn't fit on correctly, there was grease on my seat on the inside, epoxy stuck all over the place (they didn't clean it up, or off of many places on my car). After driving it around and looking it over again when I got home, I decide its gotta go back, it doesn't look good at all, it doesn't sound right, it doesn't drive right, im not happy. After calling and taking it back they were nice, but looked at me as if I was asking too much. When you can tell a bumper is not put on correctly because you can obviously see it falling off, when there is still a rough idle and when you didn't clean up all the stuff you left..... I don't think I am asking too much, just a decent job as to fixing my car correctly. They adjust the bumper, clean things up and try to do what they can to fix the mechanics. I pick it up for a second time and still not happy. I go ahead and call my insurance company and take my car home, for I am not wanting to fight with Painters again on the bad job they did with my body work. That night I drove to my insurance agents office to show him my car and low and behold, another thing painters didn't do..... plug in my head light and blinker. So not only did they let me leave the shop twice thinking and telling me they were done and did a decent job, they forget to plug in my new headlight and blinker they installed....... REALLY!? I am not sure if they were just in a hurry to get my car in and out as fast as possible and didn't care about quality work, or if they just don't care about any of the work they do.  After days of fighting with the insurance adjuster and the re-adjuster, I had to take my car down to a mechanic shop, pay out of pocket to have it looked at, because painters doesn't have any mechanics at their body shop. Found out what was wrong, got it fixed, then the re adjuster called Painters to have them re-order my bumper. I am still currently waiting on getting my new bumper put on. I was so excited how smoothly things went from the begging hoping this wouldn't be a hassle and now its been over 2 weeks and its been nothing but a pain. Not happy my re adjuster is sending my car back to the same shop to try again for a 3rd time, instead of having another shop take care of my car and probably do a good job the 1st time.

My mistake!!! I thought it was a good idea to swing by this Filiberto's and grab some Super Nachos.... something quick and easy! The whole visit wasn't quick or easy and the food was meh..... after having to wait 20 minutes in the drive through I was HANGRY!!! Who has to wait 20 minutes in a drive through for food, the point of a drive through is to get your food quick and easy! This Filiberto's definitely doesn't believe in quick.  After becoming quite hangry I finally got my food and drove all the way home. When I got home, my food was cold! Are you kidding me!? We live in AZ no way on my drive home did my food get cold, it was already cold when they gave it to me. The meat was very dry and tasteless! Needless to say I ended up wasting 20 minutes of my time getting my food and ended up throwing it away and cooking something at home! Lets get it together Filibertos!!

I decided to have my sons 3rd bday here last weekend, so this review will be about the "party" side of Peter Piper Pizza. When we arrived the tables were decorated, they had plates, cups and balloons all set up. I met with my party planner and started getting the ball rolling. I got the pizza for the kids ordered; started getting the tokens cashed in so the kids could play and the guests started arriving. When you reserve a bday at Peter Piper you are only allowed to reserve in 1  1/2 hr time blocks, not any longer. When I made my reservation a week and a half prior I called the location about the time constraint. I voiced my concern on rushing my sons bday party over just an 1  1/2 hour span. The associate told me that if we needed more time they would just move us to an un reserved table and it shouldn't be a problem, they assured me there would be room. THIS BECAME A HUGE PROBLEM! Not only was my party planner rushing me the whole time, my son didn't even have that much time to play. Having a group of 3-5 yr olds, they take a while to eat, it takes a while to round them all up while they are playing and it takes a while to open presents an 1  1/2 isn't enough time for a party. The kids got to play for maybe 30 minutes by the time the pizza came out, they were still eating when the planner came up to me and said cake and ice cream are coming out. I had to tell him no to wait so the kids could finishing eating. 15 minutes later he brought out the cake and ice cream. After getting all the kids back to the table then singing happy birthday the planner came over and told me I had 5 minutes. I had to rush passing out cake and ice cream, on the last few slices, the planner came over and started clearing the table in front of everyone. I was literally pushed of my table in the middle of serving cake and ice cream still. He said he had to set up for the next party. My planner didn't even help me move my things or presents, I had to get help from all the other guest to cram our whole party into one little booth. At this time parents began getting frustrated, because there were no open tables because all the other reserved parties took the open tables, so there was no where to sit, eat or put presents. At this time I got very frustrated and just decided to call it a day for everyone was getting annoyed with there not being any room for anything even though an associate assured me there would be room if our party was not done with the party. Its very frustrating trying to celebrate a child's birthday when all that is happening is you are being rushed and then kicked off your table. I have to shove my son in the booth, rip open his present say thank you to everyone, pack everything up and leave. That all happened with in 15 minutes. It was awful! Since there was no room for anything I had to start taking extra pizza, cake and presents to the car so people could sit and visit (the few people who decided to stay) at this time the associate followed me out thinking I was leaving without paying. At this point I kind of lost it! I told the associate I had to leave the party to move all of my things and would be back in to pay for the awful experience momentarily. I think I scared the young boy which I apologized for when I cashed out, I was just very frustrated with the whole situation. I paid my bill, gathered the rest of my things and left with my son. I think Peter Piper needs to re-think their party packages and their time limit. I requested respectfully more time and they assured me I would be fine and I wasn't. My sons bday was nothing but a rushed mess (which he doesn't care he is 3) but me my family and the other parents had to go through the rushing and hassle. The last thing you want for a bday is being rushed and hassled! NOT FUN!  The one good thing was the food! Pizza, wings, breadsticks, ice cream..... was all very tasty (the little bit I had time to snack on while running around)

I love this place! Every time I come here, there is no wait, the staff is very friendly and I am always happy with my meal! Our last visit our waiter was very nice and sweet with my little boy and even gave us a coupon code from online to save us a few bucks on our meal! He was very nice and went out of his way to help us, that doesn't happen much these days! My taste buds go bonkers for their jalapeno cream cheese (fendido) sauce! It's cream cheese sauce with a kick of jalapenos, makes any Mexican dish ZING! Whenever I am in the mood for Mexican food, this is the place I think of first! Mmmmmmm delicioso!!!!   This place is good if you want Mexican food and want to watch the game, for they have a full bar section away from the dining part, or if you and your family or friends would like a nice meal, they have the dining section away from the bar that you can sit at.

This is a great pizza place. Whether we are dinning in or getting the pizza to go, I have never been disappointed. They have nice thick crusted pizza; the toppings are always spilling off the sides (which is delicious, a ton of pizza places skim you on toppings) and the prices are not too bad! Their salads and wings are also mmm mmmm good. Staff is always polite and professional! Oh and one last surprise, they have Gluten Free pizza for any of you that unfortunately suffer from Celiac! Yay! Im a fan indeed!

This place is so much fun! I decided to take my son and a few of his friends here Saturday morning before we had his bday party. Its very affordable, they have 2 large bounce rooms and a lot of different things to do. For their open jump on Saturday mornings (make sure you make a reservation because space fills up quick) it was really nice to show up, pay, no line, no hassle and the kids get right in. They jumped in one area for 45 minutes and then the other for 45 minutes. Its doesn't seem like long enough time when you think about it as a number, but my kids were pooped by the time we left! It was perfect! They didn't get bored in either room because there were enough things to do. Each room was clean, put together well and had enough activities to keep from 2-10 yr olds happy. Its hot here in AZ, so having a bounce house outside at our house just isn't worth it. Taking the kids to this place was awesome! Air conditioning and plenty to do. If the kids needed to take a break, they have a small arcade and sitting area out front. They also have benches inside the playrooms for the parents to sit and watch.  Had a great time and will definitely be going back before summer is over!

I was a little worried about taking my boyfriends car here because of the reviews about coupons. He bought a groupon for a full tire service. I called the shop to see if you had to schedule an appointment or if I could just drop it off, its Saturday, better safe than sorry, this was the most helpful. If you dont have an appointment plan on dropping your car off all day! I dropped it off about 11 and they finished it right before they closed at 4. This was nice because I just left it down there all day and got a ride home and back. They did everything I asked, took the groupon and I only had to pay about $10 extra for supplies and shop fees. The tires were done, looked good, everything worked out without any hassle or them trying to upsell me. The employees were friendly, nice, informative and even let me know one of the wheels were bent but it still balanced out so it was ok to drive on (probably a huge pot hole while driving around in Houston) lol! A- OK in my book!

Love this place! I have a ton of friends who are involved in a lot of different sports and anytime they need anything we head out to Bass Pro Shop! The last adventure we went on was a shooting expedition! We were able to get all the ammo we needed, we also picked up clay pigeons for a decent price, safety gear and some boots! In and out within about 20 minutes, no fuss!! It nice to be able to get everything you need all in one VERY LARGE shop, with lots of choices and decent prices! Random side note, I also like this place because each time I go in I see decorations I have not seen before (stuffed animals, different fish) lots of random wilderness things to take it! Just randomly fun for me! :)

Love this place! My friend wasn't able to make it out of town for the 4th, so to cheer him up I took him out for a night of fun. D&B was our second stop; we spent most of our time here because it's awesome!!!! Who doesn't like to kick back, have a few drinks then get crazy playing video games? There are enough games that everyone is pretty spread out and you only have to wait for a game if you really want to play it and someone just started playing. Most of the time if you are waiting to play, people play once then let other people go and keep rotating. It's nice to be in such a cool atmosphere, with music, drinks and video games. It's never too packed when I have gone and the food, service and drinks are affordable and good! It's a nice place to go to have a good time without having to go to multiple places and you are able to beat the hear. Everything you really need is in this one place! One tip, keep your players card, because you can reuse it if you don't use all your credits or your tickets!! Save them for next time! :)  Had a great night! Thanks D&B!

This is a cool marketplace! They have all kinds of different stores, to where you can travel to one place and get a lot of shopping done. Keep in mind its pretty large so you may have to walk, but get some exercise, don't be lazy! I really enjoy that they have misters on during the summer time. It's hot here in AZ so you get a little cool off as your shopping. They have a few different options to eat, a couple bars, lots of different shops and little kiosks. They have big stores like Target, Harkins Theatre and an Old Navy. Each time I come here everything is nice and kept clean, parking is rough though so if you are coming just to shop be prepared you may have to walk.

We went out for my moms b-day on Cinco De Mayo and really didn't want to deal with crowds. So we chose a wine place hoping all the Cinco De Mayo party goers were somewhere else! We picked correct, because when we arrived for lunch no one was in the restaurant. It was nice to have the place to ourselves for about an hour. Our waitress was very lovely and helpful. She was able to find a wine the whole table liked and gave each of us different options off the menu. I ordered the hand made pasta with chicken and basil pesto! It was absolutely delicious!!!! Once she set my plate down I dove right in! It was full of flavor, the chicken was nice and juicy and the pasta was cooked perfectly! My sister has more bland taste buds and ordered the artichoke dip. She was thinking along the lines of a regular plain artichoke dip and what she got was a surprise. The artichoke dip included chorizo, goat cheese and corn relish, definitely something my sister wasn't expecting. I thought it was awesome! They have their own little recipe to give plain artichoke dip a bigger bang! My mom enjoyed every bit of her brushetta and my sister spiced up her mac n chesses with the waiters recommendations! 3 out of 4 happy in our family never really happens, so my hats off to you D'Vine! Since my one sisters taste buds are so bland the waiter insisted she have dessert on the house. I thought that was very nice of her, for it wasn't the cooks fault that she didn't enjoy her meal. Not a lot of places are like that, so it was a nice treat for the table. A big thank you for that!  We spent quite some time here eating, drinking and visiting. The staff was so friendly and kind the whole time we were there, which is always enjoyable and the food was absolutely delicious! It was a great start to celebrating my moms birthday!

This place is pretty cool! Its inside Bass Pro Shop, which you think at first is kind of weird and would be really small, NO not at all! Bass Pro shop is huge and this restaurant is also. When you first walk in you can see a large fish tank that separates the front room dinning area and bar from the back dinning room. Once you get around the bar and the beautifully large fish tank, the restaurant opens up into a large dinning area. The celling is very high and the space in there is just so opening and welcoming. The decorations with the fish on the walls, the tables, the large fireplace in the middle of the dinning area, the paint, the fish tank..... it all works perfectly together to create an outdoor ambiance, with a lot of class and openness! I really loved the way they have this restaurant set up, its beautiful!  Ok onto the food! We received an order of I believe sugar glazed bread when we ordered our drinks! Oh my goodness this bread is delicious. The sugar on the top gives the bread a little extra mmmmmm. It might just be me because I cant eat a lot of bread due to my gluten intolerance, but I had to have at least 1 piece! They have a great spread of different kinds of meals, from chicken, to sea food, to steaks to alligator! YES I said alligator! I have never had alligator before, so of course it was one of the appetizers I ordered just to give it a whirl! The best way to describe the breaded alligator, is that it has a shrimp texture, with a chicken tenderness to it. So its a mix of shrimp and chicken. It doesn't have a weird taste or bite to it at all. The sauce that was served with the alligator actually really played with the flavor well! It created a nice little extra bite to the gator to give it more flavor. For my main dish I had the shrimp pasta. The alfredo sauce was different, and really blended with the shrimp well. It was nice to have a dish with large pieces of shrimp to eat and not little bite sized shrimp. My friend ordered the cajun chicken pasta. This dish was served with the same alfredo sauce as mine but with the cajun taste instead of shrimp. I have to say his chicken was spiced deliciously and I enjoyed his plate much more than mine. The combination of the cajun spices along with the alfredo sauce made a great dish!  The staff here was incredibly friendly, our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful when we asked about he alligator dish, the manager came and checked on our dishes as we were eating and everyone wished us a nice goodbye as we left! I like going to places like this, being surrounded by friendly people who enjoy their job and having a great meal, its just a great way to start off a good Sunday funday!

Best place to buy shoes if you are a big time runner. Running out here in AZ, we have asphalt, cement and packed dirt. All these things are so hard on your joints, bones and muscles, so getting a great pair of shoes to fit the way you run and where you run really helps. Road Runner will have you do a few test to figure out what shoe best fits your running style and if needed a custom fit insole to help correct and assist with your specific run. I had no idea that the way I ran was what causes my knee pain. After getting a pair of shoes and insoles from here, I havent been in pain once from running like I have in the past. I really appreciate the time the reps took to help me make sure the money I was spending (bit pricey) was worth every penny. Definitley reccomend coming here, you wont regret it and so far my shoes are lasting better than any of my cheaper pairs.

Yummy!!! This place is pretty delicious! Great service, wonderful decor and good Sushi! I had the Shrimp Calamari Tempura Roll! It was delicious! Calamari, shrimp, cucumber, avocado, cream cheese and crunchy Tempura bits. The bits were even pink and green for Easter!!!! They may come in that color all the time, I forgot to ask, but I would like to say since I went there just before Easter they did the bits in those colors to be festive! It was awesome! I cant wait to go back and try more! PS - Try the spicy garlic edamame, gives normal edamame a little kick! Great starter! Keep it up RA! I may become a regular!!

This place has me at a meh! Its not the best and its not the worst! Best part is its cheap, if your looking for bang for your buck this is definitely the place, dont expect quality though! Its very cool to be able to eat sushi cheap and try a ton of different kinds of rolls, but when you have had good sushi its hard to go to this lower quality taste. Yes its awesome, the sushi is on a conveyor belt, tons of different rolls to choose from and you can actually see it and pick it up and try it. Yet the taste, just room temperature, bland and squishy. I do think this is a great way to start out trying sushi for the first time! It was frustrating that most of the signs were old/rubbed off so you couldn't see what they said to figure out if you wanted to try the roll or not, or remember it for the future at different places. The staff working this day didn't speak a lick of English, which can be super frustrating when you are just asking for a water and you cant explain that any different. They had pudding and cheese cake on the belt for dessert which I found funny, but I tried it and its basically a piece from a store bought cheese cake. Funny part, since no one spoke English I couldn't get a fork, also they were really bad at paying attention to customers who needed things. They kept disappearing, very bad customer service. so anyway, I had to eat my cheese cake with my fingers! Try eating cheese cake with chop sticks..... doesn't work, fingers thanks for the help! LOL! After almost finishing my piece of cheese cake she saw me eating with my hands so she brought over a fork! A little late, I was done shoveling it in my mouth haha. If you want cheap Saki Bombers and Sushi, come here for sure, good deals! Looking for a cheap date, this is your place. Still an overall meh with me! I like more quality in my food!

So this was my first time eating at Red Robin ever..... yes I said ever...... I was really excited to see that they had a mushroom burger on their menu! Not a lot of places have mushroom burgers so I was super excited to try it. When our food came out my burger was cooked to my specifications, but the taste of the burger and the mushrooms was very dull. I felt like there was no flavor or pizazz to the burger. With all the mushrooms, onions and cheese I figured this burger would be making my taste buds jump around. Instead it did the complete opposite. I ate a few bites and decided to just visit with my friend and munch on my fries. My fries were cold and kind of mushy. When I eat french fries, I like them crispy and warm. A lot of my friends love this place, so I will give it another try, just not a very good first impression. Maybe if I order something else I will have better luck! I usually try to give new places more than one shot just on that occasional off day we all have every now and then. :)

Tried this place last week, because of the Yelp reviews and I have to say, SO GLAD WE DID! This place is different than other sushi places, as in they have a very large amount of different and unique rolls. There are so many to chose from I cant wait to go back and try new ones. I honestly think you wont be disappointed in coming here. The place is a bit small, like most sushi places, great friendly staff, nice atmosphere. If you are looking for traditional rolls, sashimi, soups, they do have them, but I suggest you step out of your box and order their popcorn shrimp roll!  Sushiya, thanks for the delicious food, we will see you soon!

I have passed by this restaurant many times visiting Tempe Market Place. I am quite upset that I did not venture in sooner. This place is wonderful! As we walked in we were greeted by very friendly staff members, and were seated right away. It was nice to be at a restaurant to where you receive service as soon as you are seated. We were able to order a few drinks and an appetizer as we looked over our menu. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, and even suggested a few options since we were new to the restaurant. Our food came out pretty quick, and was cooked to perfection. Not only was the steak I ordered cooked to my liking, it was juicy and full of flavor. On top of my potato side dish I also received a few veggies. I am not a huge veggie person, but the asparagus and the grilled peppers were a perfect combination with my steak. Pricing wise The Keg isn't too expensive, but it's higher up there. If you are looking for a great steakhouse and are willing to pay a little extra for flavor and a nice setting, this place is definitely worth trying.  I will be going back very soon!

Who doesn't like a delicious steak dinner!??? This particular Texas Roadhouse is close to home, so its nice coming here for the convenience fact. Not only is that a perk, but each time I have visited this location I have never been disappointed. My food is always prepared exactly how I asked for it. We went here yesterday for my mom's birthday with a pretty large party. The restaurant was very nice at working around our large party and making sure we were taken care of. We had 2 very nice waiter's who went above and beyond making sure all 17 of us were happy. I ordered the 8oz sirloin and had it covered in melted jack cheese and mushrooms! The medium rare steak was perfect and the jack cheese and mushrooms gave the steak a great kick. The mashed potatoes were covered in cheese, butter and anything else you would like them covered in. Very impressed with the staff and was very happy with my food!  Thanks for making it a nice evening out for my moms birthday! Keep it up!

I am not a huge Sea Food lover, but from time to time I like to get me some shrimp! I don't get all crazy with Lobster or Crab...... shrimp is where its at for me! The reason I love Red Lobster (because I get the same dish every time I go) is for their delicious Shrimp Linguine! If I am in the mood for sea food alfredo Red Lobster is where im at. The shrimp is always tasty (rarely ever fishy tasting) the linguine is perfectly al dente and the alfredo sauce is del to the ishious! Red Lobster is also known for their Cheddar Bay biscuits! Sweet mama I will eat 12 of these in one sitting, if my stomach permits it. The combination of the biscuits and their delicious fresh salads are a perfect start to your meal!  This particular Red Lobster is always a pleasure to visit. We come here maybe once a month maybe more for the location and the service. Not once have I been disappointed with the food or the service. The wait of course for Friday or Saturday night dinner is pretty long, but that is to be expected. For a chain restaurant I have to say they have their game face on, for I will visit any chain in any state to get me some scrumptious Shrimp Alfredo!   Keep it up Red Lobster and this Shrimp Lover will be back for your annual Shrimp Lover Months!!!

Not a bad place at all for the area. There are a lot of pizza places in queen creek, a few mexican food places, lots of fast food and 1 sushi place! I have to say they do pretty well for being the only sushi place in town. Its not top of the line sushi hence the reason for not a 5 star, but it is better then some other places I have been to outside QC. I think I have tried about 5 different rolls here and so far my favorite is the Betty Roll! Staff is very friendly, the place is small but cute and relaxed. Keep it up, you guys are doing well!

Stopped here for a bite to eat before the Holiday weekend, had a great time! My son and I enjoyed a nice meal together, with great service and good food. I ordered the pasta with chicken and it unfortunately was different from what I remember, so I am not sure if they changed their recipe or if my taste buds have changed. It was a little dry and not as flavorful and spicy as last time, but it was decent. My son of course had the chicken fingers and french fries, he was a happy camper! Their baked potato soup and bread is very good, I was told by my 5 yr old we have to go back every day just so he can eat the bread lol! Will definitely try some of the fan favorites next time and look forward to another interaction with the polite and smiling staff. Thanks guys!

I love Johnny Rockets!!! I love the oldies music, the atmosphere, the food!!! It's great!!! The problem is, just like every franchise it's the managers, or owners that are the ones responsible to make you want to come back or not. I have been to a few different Johnny Rockets in AZ and each one is different of course on service and taste of food. I go to the Johnny Rockets out at San Tan Mall at least 3 times a month. I would go more if the service and food quality stayed consistent. It's frustrating to go and LOVE the experience and food and the next time you go back it's the complete opposite. I just visited this Jonny Rockets on Saturday 11/24 in the evening. We sat outside for the weather was fantastic. It took them 15 minutes to even acknowledge we were outside, we waited 10 minutes to place our drink order, another 20 to order our food, then another 35 minutes to get our food, at least 15 more to get our check, we weren't asked if we wanted dessert on top of that taking another 20 minutes. Needless to say, we missed our movie that was playing right across the way, it took us over 2 hours to eat, our waiter was cranky and didn't care to take care of us. Now onto the food..... it's a hit and miss every time I go! This particular time, it was ridiculous. The burgers were tasteless, the fries were cold..... I didn't understand why it was such a bad night for this place. I want to know why their food portion and the taste changes from every visit. Do the managers change; do the cooks change.... what is going on? One time we order the American Meal Deal. You get a huge burger, a huge side of fries and a drink. This time we got a small burger, a half a scoop of fries on the same plate and a drink. Their chili cheese fries are my favorite but I always have to be super clear when I order because sometimes I get a whole plate full and sometimes I get a half a plate and told its the appetizer size. Also they change from giving you graded cheese and nacho cheese on the chili cheeses fries, and when you ask the waiter they have no idea why your asking...... well I wouldn't ask if the order was always the same. I also feel like they shouldn't advertise fresh brownies on their brownie sundays if your going to serve hard stale brownies. I would love to keep visiting this Johnny Rockets, but im afraid I have to finally throw in the towel and look else ware to eat in San Tan Mall. I feel I have given them enough chances and it's frustrating to be such a flip floppy restaurant.

This is my go-to spot for my son for his haircuts! I really like the check-in online option they have! It really saves a lot of time and keeps you from waiting in the salon for so long. Having an active 3 year old, means waiting patiently, highly unlikely! LOL! So its nice to get the wait time on my phone, then drive down there when its close to the check in time given. I have never had a problem with any of his haircuts, the information for his fohawk is saved in the computer, so each stylist knows exactly what cut I want for him. Each stylist and receptionist have been very friendly, courteous, kind and patient when giving my son his hair cuts! Great place! Keep it up! :D

This casino is pretty fun! It's on the newer side so everything is still kind of new and fancy! I love how open the casino is laid out with a variety of slot machines, tables and having the bar in the center of the casino floor. There is always a lot going on here. They have a nice fancy restaurant upstairs which is called Shula's, they also have different events in their large hall. We visited this casino for my mom's birthday and had a nice time. Each of us was able to find a machine we could play for quite some time. It's nice to be able to go to a casino and sit at a machine for some time and not loose all your money in 2 seconds. Luck may have been with my sister and I this day for each of us won quite a bit of money on one of the new machines! Caaaaaaaching! $$$$! Winning money is always fun! The decorations, cleanliness, staff and machines will keep me going back for more.   I also loved that we were able to get some cheap rooms last summer and hang out by their pool. The pool is pretty big and they have a lot of sitting areas. You can even rent a private cabana and they have waiters that walk around to take care of each guest. If your in a hurry you can visit the outside bar yourself for some food or a drink. They have a pretty decent menu for an outside pool bar!   The hotel rooms are very cool. You have a very large window with a great view of Arizona. I recommend one of the higher floors with a view overlooking the mountains, sunset and sunrise. The room we stayed in was standard, but everything in it was very new, clean and fancy! I was honestly blown away by how cheap the rooms were (with our players club card) and how fancy they were set up! Big bang for your buck!  I enjoy spending my time and money here. Not a lot of people can say that about a casino! Keep it up Wild Horse Pass!

I cant say enough good things about this bridal boutique! After our horrible fiasco at Davids Bridal, I am so glad we found this gem for my sister to look for her wedding dress. The customer service from start to finish was beyond superb, the women were very friendly, helpful, caring and knowledgeable. When we showed up for her appointment we were greeted with a smile as soon as we entered and offered some water. Then shown to the floor to take a peak while our stylist got ready. It took about 5 minutes and she was out on the floor helping us look for different styles for my sister to try. After about an hour of searching and trying on dresses my sister was sad that she still had not yet found "the one". The sales associate then decided to try a few different styles my sister thought she wouldn't want. Of course,,,,,,, BOOM...... The woman found my sister her "dress" this one was "the one!" We were shocked it was exactly what she thought she didn't want. This sales associate knew her stuff and went with her professional instincts and found my sister her dress!  Ladies thank you so much for the great experience! I know my sister is very excited for it to come in and get it fitted. So glad we found you on Yelp, you saved the day!!!!

This place is beautiful! I love the open atmosphere it creates with long large tables, large chairs and open windows and doors to the patio area. The chandeliers hanging in the main dining area add just that bit of "fancy" the place needs, perfect touch. I really enjoy the patio seating this time of year, even though you are sat close together to other groups for some reason you still get a privacy vibe. I don't know if it's the way the tables are set up, or the company I was with! They have a small stage inside that they have live music played some nights, but I don't really enjoy it for I feel its a little too much for the restaurant.  The food is delicious! We decided to get the onion dip and chips for an appetizer, something really easy that you can eat at home right? Well Culinary makes a great dip! We couldn't stop ourselves, trying to remember that our main courses were coming! I had the rainbow trout! I NEVER eat fish so when I am randomly craving it, this place is where I come. It's smothered in almonds and this delicious creamy sauce...... HANDS OFF I don't share this dish. My boyfriend decided to ordered the fried chicken (which you have to wait a little extra time for) and it was definitely worth the wait. The chicken was moist and tender and the sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw were like eating at grandma's house.  I am very impressed with the staff here. On a Wednesday night, it was pretty packed, for 2 we had to wait about 30 minutes but the staff is very courteous by grabbing your cell number and texting you when your table is ready. The bar had a few open seats, so we were able to have a drink before dinner. I like that there are no uniforms here, each of the staff members are able to show off their individuality and personality with the way they dress, which I feel makes them more comfortable and friendly. Its really hipster, the staff is very friendly and laid back! If you're not paying attention it does make it a little hard to find your waitress or waiter, but you should be so kind to pay attention to the people taking care of you for the evening.  Certainly a great place to put on your list. Great location, great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food! Keep it up Culinary!!

This park is close to my niece's school so we visit frequently. Both my niece and nephew have their soccer and t-ball games here. The grass for the games is always kept up, so it's nice that the kids are able to play on a lush field. I like that the playground itself has an awning/cover, so when the sun is out, the equipment and the kids are in the shade. There are not a lot of picnic tables so if you are looking to have a birthday party here, make sure you come early to reserve some covered seating for your party. The park also has a basketball court and softball fields around the corner. The softball fields are nice, clean and they have an open snack bar! If you visit the park during one of the major kid's games, you can also catch the shaved ice truck in the parking lot. The atmosphere is great, it's nice and clean, good park to take the kids!

This was my first visit to this doctor for my son. I have to say I was impressed and very happy with the visit. When we first called it unfortunately took 2 weeks to get an appointment, but this is a specialist so appointments are a little harder to get. When we arrived the office staff was very friendly and informative on what was needed and how long it would take to get back to the doctor. Once we got back to a room the nurse came right in and got all of my sons info and took his vitals. 10 minutes later the doctor came in to disucss what was needed to run the allergy tests on my son. He was very nice, professional and personable. My son was very comfortable when the nurses came in to do the tests and it only took 15 minutes to get the results. unfortunately we didn't figure out what was wrong with my son, but the doctor gave us a few options on what we can start with. I am hoping the medicine he recommended will help my sons nose clear up and not keep constantly running 10 months out of the year. I would recommend this doctor to friends and family for I felt like he spent a good amount of time with me and my son to help us figure out what might be wrong with him and what he could do to help figure it out.

When I purchased my new home, I knew I would have to find a company to come in and give the carpets and tile a nice deep clean. When it comes to carpet cleaning there are many options out there, so I did some digging. With a referral from my dad I decided to Try Ken's Steam Away. It is a family ran business, who have taken good care of my dads house, so I decided to give it a go. I called and got an estimate over the phone and was able to schedule the exact day and time I needed. Ken, his wife and son showed up on time and ready to work! They were able to get 4 bedrooms of carpet and all the tile through out my house done in about 2 hours. They were very friendly, informative, affordable and most importantly did a GREAT job. They were able to get all the stains out of my carpet, but one and made the tile look brand new! They left me a free bottle of their carpet cleaner and told me to use that on any stains that didn't come out and give them a call back. Unfortunately I have been so busy moving in I haven't called them back yet, but as soon as I do I know they will get me taken care of! Thanks so much for making my new house look like it has brand new carpet and tile! Great job!

Nice, simple, easy and cheap! Exactly what I wanted! I went into Sears Outlet to find a new dishwasher for my new house! The sales rep that greeted us at the door, was very friendly, informative, nice and quick! I told her exactly what I wanted and she was able to find me a brand new black dishwasher on their online store, for under $300! Cant beat that! With free home delivery! YES PLEASE!!!  Sears called me to verify appointment time for drop off and hall away. The tehcs called me when they were on their way, were on time, brought the dishwasher right into the kitchen, I signed and they left! Very nice and friendly!  Very happy with this store from the beginning to end! I will definitely be going back here, if I need anything else for my house! :D

I am not very happy with this particular Edible Arrangements location. After placing an order online it says to call the delivery store to see if you can get a schedule delivery time. So after I placed my order I went ahead and did this. After talking to a woman about my delivery she said that she couldn't guarantee an exact delivery time, which is understandable, but I was wondering if I could at least request a morning time delivery. She looked at her drivers schedule and she said her driver isn't scheduled to even start delivering until 12. So I asked her if my delivery could be close to the top for the delivery address is literally 2 miles from their store and the person receiving it gets off around 3. She said she would put a note on my order and have it delivered as one of the first stops. The day of the delivery by 1:00 I new my ordered wasn't delivered, so I called the store and asked them for an update. Another woman answered and said she talked to her driver and it would be delivered in the next 30 - 45 minutes which puts the time at 1:30-1:45ish. By 2:30 I called the person who was supposed to get the SURPRISE delivery and they still did not receive it. I knew they were leaving work soon and so I wanted to call them and give them a heads up so they could receive their surprise edible arrangement before they left, this was the reason I called the day before and asked the store to have it delivered as early as possible. By 3:00 I finally received word for the person receiving the delivery that they got it. They were headed out the door when the driver showed up. What was the point in ordering this surprise delivery, going to all the work to talking to the store to have it delivered as soon as possible if I was going to have to go through the hassle of ruining the surprise and it being delivered right before the person leaves work. I was hoping since I went out of my way to communicate with the store that was literally 2 miles from the delivery stop that it would be taken care of.  On a side note, why would a place delivering fruit wait so long to start sending out deliveries, especially if they have business deliveries to make. In my mind fruit is more of a breakfast thing and would make sense to be delivered in the morning time. Who wants to eat fruit for a snack, after they have just filled up on lunch? Also if its delivered to an office after lunch, im sure the person receiving the delivery is not really hungry anymore so they take it home, what is the point of getting it delivered to work if you end up taking it home because its delivered right before you end your day at work or you have already eaten for the day.  These arrangements are beautiful and pretty pricy, I expected a little more from this company. My surprise delivery was completely ruined because the store couldn't take care of or didn't listen to my needs, even though they assured me they would take care of it. As a customer when you go out of your way to communicate with a company and they tell you they are going to take care of it, you shouldn't have to worry about it and check up on it. I ended up calling this company 3 times to check on my delivery and each time they told me it was getting taken care of. The surprise was ruined; my delivery wasn't delivered until the person receiving it was walking out the door and it was nothing but a huge hassle. Not impressed or satisfied at all and will probably not be ordering from Edible Arrangements again, let alone this particular delivery store.

I usually don't review "mall stores" but I felt like this Tilly's really needed a shout out! I was shopping for a watch for my bf for his bday. He lives in a different state than me so shopping for him for a surprise present is a little difficult, because I want to make sure he likes what I buy. After spending a good 30 minutes picking out the best watch I think he will like I checked out. I was nervous that my bf might not like it and asked the rep what their return policy was. He stated that their watches are final sales. This made me super nervous because I was spending a pretty penny on something my bf might not like. I asked if it was possible to exchange the watch if my bf didn't like it. I explained my situation and let him know he lives in a different state and made sure there was a Tilly's by his place so just in case he didn't like it, could he exchange it in Texas for one he likes. I knew it was a long shot and a lot to ask, but the rep was very nice and was able to help me out. He added a note to the receipt and put his name and store initials. This way if my bf didn't like the style watch I picked out he could exchange it for one he liked in Texas. I really appreciate the attention and help Aubryience (sorry I know I spelled it wrong) gave me. He was able to help me make sure this birthday present was wonderful!  To my luck my bf LOVED the watch I picked out so he didnt have to exchange it, but I am glad I covered all my bases just in case! Thanks again for the great customer service!

This place is pretty cool! What you would expect out of a NYPD Pizza place. It was decorated in a modern NY style, with a huge kitchen in the back. We decided to split the Brooklyn Family pizza and had a few drinks while we waited. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to prepare, it was nice that our server let us know that upfront so we were prepared. Our server (I wish I could remember his name) was very nice, sweet and funny. When you come to smaller restaurants like this that aren't so busy, its nice to have staff that visit a little with you. He gave my friend a few different samples of the beers they had and they discussed different beer options while I sat back and enjoyed by drink. He saw a picture of my son on my phone and asked me about him and then told me a little about his family. I thought it was very kind of him to have a little conversation with us while we waited on our lunch.  When the pizza came out it was delicious! It was thin crust with a thicker edge, filled with cheese, pepperoni, sausage and basil! We ate every last slice! That was at least 3-4 slices each! Perfect size for 2 hungry adults.  Enjoyed the atmosphere, the staff and the food! We were able to walk out with a huge pizza and a few drinks for under $30! Perfect! Keep it up NYPD

My family and I have been seeing Dr. Huston for years! He and his staff are great! Everyone is very friendly, they try their best to get you in as soon as possible and you can tell they care about each of their patients. Dr. Huston has always been able to un-knot my kinks, put me back into place and alleviate any painful areas I have problems with. He doesn't rush your adjustments and makes sure he takes his time to get you back in tip-top shape!

I really don't care for this bar much at all. Its more of your divey laid back chill bar, then any of the "club" bars around Old Town. The reason I dislike this bar is the customer service. The girls that work here are so wrapped up in trying to milk tips that they really don't care to give you what you come there for, A DRINK! Each time I am here my friends and I have to literally WAVE down a bartender because they are either too busy talking to each other, singing while fixing their hair or make up, or in their own world no paying attention. The girls that serve drinks from outside the bar take forever to get your drink order to you and have always been quite rude. On weekends the place is so packed you literally walk from the entrance 2 steps in and you are shoulder to shoulder with everyone. Making it impossible to get to the bar, the bathroom, or even back outside once you have made it inside. I think it is packed like this because usually the bar has no line. So people who just want to drink and not stand in line for any of the other good bars, just default into coming here because they don't have to wait in line.  Unlike some of the other bars in Old Town this place doesn't have a dress code. A lot of people who come out don't realize that the surrounding bars have such a strict dress code. So if you find yourself not clean cut enough to make it into any of the other bars, all the tom, dick and harrys come here..... (ladies what does that tell you)  Now lets talk about the drinks! Ladies lets get it together....... Learn how to pour your drinks. Each time I come here the mixed drinks are horrible! If I order a bottle or a can BAM your set in 2 seconds, but if the bartenders actually have to put some effort into making a mixed drink, its like its rocket science. It takes them twice as long, I get something I didn't ask for, they used the wrong alcohol, or it just doesn't taste good.   The music they play is usually rock, which is a nice change from all the bars around it; they have a few TV's playing the music videos but nothing really spectacular. If you find yourself in Old Town and just want a chill place to go to this is your place. Honestly I rather go to any of the other bars over this one, for better drinks and better customer service.

Ohhhh my goodness what a disappointment. Went here yesterday to grab a bite and enjoy the nice weather. When we showed up we asked for a seat on the patio because its nice outside. There were about 5 tables empty that had not been bused yet, it took the hostess a good 15 minutes to get a table cleaned and get us seated. After that we waited another 15 minutes before our server even came over and asked us for our drink order. It was a little frustrating because the place was a little, busy but not packed. Every time we turned around our waiter was missing, yet everyone else's waiters were taking care of their tables. Finally got drinks, server forgot sweetener for the tea 3 times, 4th time, just stopped asking and drank the tea, food took a while to get out, nothing really special. We ordered 2 burgers and fries. Ordered my burger medium, was pretty well done, my boyfriend ordered his medium rare and was pretty well done. No real taste to the burger itself, the toppings helped some, but not really a great burger for the price! I think by the time the food came, we were irritated just ate and wanted to get out of there. Unfortunately not a memorable place and will not be returning. With this place being around for a while and in Old Town Scottsdale I was expecting a little more. No wonder Rehab burger around the corner had a line out their door (we should have stayed waiting in line over there)

Ok ok I get what the hype is all about now! This place is pretty cool! This particular location has a great outdoor patio area! Also on this day they were serving half off their bottles of wine! How does that not make you like the place even more already! They have a pretty decent wine selection (mostly the basics) and a nice food selection. You can get anything from nachos to ramen noodles! I have never had ramen noodles at a restaurant before, so I am thinking I will have to try that the next time I come here. We came more for drinks and hanging out then we did the food, so I split the nachos and street tacos with a friend. The meat had a great taste to it, the guacamole was fresh and the chips were nice and crispy! We were here for quite a long time and our waitress was very helpful with drink selections and answering questions, we were even able to sample a few different wines. It was nice that she kept checking back with us to make sure we were doing well, even after we finished our meals.  Great new trendy place to stop in and check out. I am interested in going back and trying more of the food!

If my tongue could do a happy dance, it would totally do it for the food at Rigatony's! Everything from the salad, to the bread, to the appetizers, to the main dishes, it all was fantastic! I had the zucchini for an appetizer, these were delicious, nice and crispy and the batter actually had seasoning so it was quite tasty. For my main dish I split the chicken parmesan and the chicken fettuccini alfredo with my friend. Both dishes were great! Each one cooked to perfection, with very tasty seasoned sauces and nice juicy chicken! The portions at this restaurant are huge, definitely enough to take home for later! I cant wait to go back and try a few other dishes! I had to flip a coin to decide what I wanted to eat this night because I wanted to try so many different things. The only reason this didn't get a 5 star was because the wait time. Waiting to eat here is a little ridiculous. We had a reservation for 7:15 and didn't end up getting seated until 7:45 because we had a party of 9. To me that is not a huge party, but a decent size. To have to wait an extra 30 minutes for a table to eat is no fun. Especially when you have a very active and very hungry 3 year old with you. I am hoping the next time we go without reservations, the wait time isn't as long. Other than that, the staff was very friendly, our waitress was very nice and quick, great décor and kind of a "homey" vibe, great place to try!!! Good for a date, night out with friends or a family time meal!!

I went to Talking Stick Resort Release Pool Party last weekend for my bday! This place is pretty cool! It is open to the public for 21 and older and you get in for free. They have a huge spacious pool, with lots of seating and cabanas around the outer perimeter along the gate. Each cabana can be closed off for privacy, had bottle service and each has their own TV. They have a DJ every Saturday and Sunday, a full bar and a nice little menu to choose from if you get hungry. The Release Pool Party is from 11 to about 4, but the DJ doesn't really start until 12 or 1. We got here early so we could find a spot with shade and wanted to check things out before it got crazy. The older crowed and people who want to kind of chill were there, the crazy party people really didn't start pouring in until about 1. Literally every seat in the house was taken by 2, people are swimming, people are chit chatting, people are dancing, eating, drinking..... its basically a huge bar with a pool, its pretty cool.  A few tips, make sure you bring shoes because the walk to the bathrooms and the bar are pretty long and you will burn your feet. They have servers who come around and take care of food and drink orders, but once it gets busy they take too long. So walking to the bar and standing in line is easier. Also come a little early if you want a chair in the shade, it gets hot and the sun can definitely do a number on your skin. I really wish they would invest in a few more umbrellas or at least have umbrellas that shade portions of the pool, because I definitely was burnt when I left. That was applying sunscreen at least once an hour too!  Overall the prices for drinks and food aren't bad, what you would expect from a casino or bar, the DJ's are pretty cool and the atmosphere is fun! It's a good time to be had!

Oy vey! This Peter Piper has been the worst I have been to. We had to wait 15 minutes standing in the front waiting for someone to take our order and there was no one in front of us. I am not sure if they were understaffed or just didn't know what was going on, a gentleman finally came up front and took our order as if we just got there. After ordering our pizza I went and played games with my son and half of the games were broken. After 30 minutes of playing the games we could get to work, I went and asked about our order (because there were only about 4 families in the whole place) and it was taking quite some time to get our pizza. When I asked the guy about our order he said it would be right up, 15 minutes later our pizza was finally ready. When I picked it up, they forgot we ordered wings with our pizza, so we had to wait for our wings to be made. The pizza was really dry and burnt tasting, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wings were tasteless, there was no buffalo sauce taste to them at all.  Dont think ill be making a trip here again

I went here for the first time on Saturday and left feeling fantastic. I had a hair appointment with Maddy, she did a fantastic job! She was able to give me a cut and color I am completely happy with! I will definitely be calling her again when its time for some touch ups. The staff was very friendly when I arrived and showed me where I could sit and wait, the business is very clean and set up very cool. All the products they sell are down stairs with a few stations downstairs in the back, then they have most their salon stations upstairs. Pretty neat! Very happy with the product I purchased, my stylist and the atmosphere!! My hair needed the love! Thanks ladies!!

It has been months since I have had anything done with my hair, so I decided it was time to go in and get my summer/pool damaged hair taken care of. Making an appointment was nice and easy, knowing I had at least a 2hr session in the chair for a cut and color they gave me a few open time slots. I was greeted right away and was taken back with an associate named Ting. She was very sweet and knowledgeable about what I was looking for in my hair color and style. She was very thorough and took her time to make sure she gave me what I wanted. When all was said and done, I LOVE my new cut and color. I haven't had someone take so long with my hair before, but I appreciated her concentration on getting it done right! I will definitely be going back to her in the future.

This little gem at San Tan Mall is pretty cool. I bought a few cupcakes for my mom for her BDay! They were delicious! We had one of the orange cream sickle and confetti cake cupcakes. We didnt go too wild, pretty basic cupcakes, but fluffy and delicious. The frosting is not too strong, or sugary and the cupcake itself is tasty. I do want to go back and try their champagne cupcake and cookie dough cupcake, look delicious just too much at one time haha.

Love this place! Every time I come here the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. They have great prices on food and great drinks! My favorite is the 3 tacos appetizer. You get a chicken, steak and pork taco wrapped in corn tortillas. A lot of Mexican food places in AZ are hit and miss, this place has great tasting everything, down to the beans and chips and salsa. Each Mexican food places I like, I like for different reasons, because of a certain dish, or what I am in the mood for. I wish I could combine 3 different Mexican food places around the valley to make 1 delicious one haha. This place has always grabbed my attention because of their tacos and tequila specials! I also have a friend who loves this place too, so its our little spot to have a great meal, great conversation and surrounded by fun people for a good night.  I am certain when you come here you wont be disappointed! Check out their happy hour when you can. Keep it up Tia Rosa!

I really enjoyed this little Mexican food joint! Even though it is quit small, they are really great at trying to accommodate all of their guest. We were seated right away and were given a very friendly welcome. The chips and salsa are complimentary as soon as you sit down, that alone filled me up for the salsa and cheese dip is amazing! The menu is a decent size, and the portions of food for the price are excellent. My friend and I both enjoyed our meal and had enough to each take home for left over's. I was very impressed by the taste, quality of the restaurant and the friendliness of the staff. I will hopefully make it back out there soon to enjoy another delicious meal. Kudos to the owner for being able to make a little hole in the wall Mexican food restaurant become so popular! Great job Morenos!

So my weekend consisted of helping a friend fix his car.... nice and exciting! Lucky for him I am a girl who loves cars and doesn't mind getting dirty! Gear head/grease monkey! Any who, since mechanic is not my profession, we needed a little help to get the diagnostic done on his car to see what we had ahead of us. When we ventured down to O'Reilly Auto Parts we were able to get a diagnostic checker and spent some time talking to Christopher. He was a very pleasant man, who knew what he was talking about. It's nice to walk into a parts store and the people behind the counter actually know about cars, not just what the computer tells them. He gave us some good information on what parts to check when we looked up the codes from the tester. After taking about 10 trips to O'Reilly's we were finally able to get the correct parts taken care of. Not only was Chris able to rent us the tools we needed, he was able to order the parts we needed and had them delivered to his store the next day for pick up. He was friendly, helpful and quick, which made the day a whole lot easier since the car we were working on was the complete opposite of all of that. Two O2 Sensors later and a new fuel pump, his car finally left the driveway! Great customer service and great prices!  Thanks for taking care of us O'Reilly's! It's nice to have someone go above and beyond not because they have to because it's their job, but because they want to help and they have the knowledge! More people need committed, nice workers like Chris!

Love this place!!! Every time I come here, the staff is always smiling, helpful and polite! Great place to grab cheap drinks and great food. I recomend any of their pizza's and their meatballs! Ohhh my goodness, their meatballs, so tasty! I wish they offered more than just 3 to a plate. Go sit inside the bar and ask for Lexi! She is so much fun, attentive, polite and great at what she does! Mellow you are lucky to have her! You guys are AWESOME, keep it up! :)

This place is pretty cool. The pool is a decent size to fit a good crowd, I definitely love the waterfall. The layout is nice, pretty spacious bar for having a pool outside. You can grab some seats inside at high top tables or at the bar. Then there are 2 more bars outside, with lounges/cabanas and a few seats here and there in the outside area. I went here on a Sunday night so it was chill, with a few people swimming and getting crazy. I heard this place is awesome for day drinking and swimming, so I am curious to come back during the day when it's hoppin to see what it brings. One piece of advice I have is, don't think you can come here to really relax and cuddle with your boo. People are there drinking and having fun, so you get splashed, hit with beach balls and people jump in right next to you. So if you are looking to just cuddle with your other half, you really don't want to get your hair wet, you have to expect to get interrupted and WET. It's not a resort pool, it's a bar full of all kinds of people so you can't get angry! Haha! Everyone is there to just have fun, your in a pool your going to get wet and interrupted!   Looking forward to a day here of drinking and trying their food menu! Ill be back!

I found 505 Sunscreens on Yelp, read the reviews and decided to call and have them come out and give me a quote. Todd came out within a few days and was able to give me a free estimate. He was very friendly, helpful and affordable. I always like to get a few different quotes when getting work done on my home because now a days there are so many different companies offering all kinds of services. You don't only want the cheapest, you want quality and customer service. After having 2 other companies come out for quotes, I decided to go with Todd. He actually took the time to answer all of my questions and concerns. The others rushed me, were not as friendly and didn't really make me feel like they wanted my business. I appreciated that 505 informed me of my different choices, what they recommend and he worked with me to accomplish what I wanted and needed for my home. Todd gave me an affordable quote, friendly as could be and was able to install around my schedule. Great service, communication and so far great product! Thanks Todd and 505 Sunscreens!

My first visit to Stand Up Live did not go so well, but I am now here to say they have stepped up their game!  We went to the Saturday night show to watch Carlos Mencia and I can honestly say I felt like I was at a new business, I am very happy with the changes! Stand Up now allows you to reserve a table for your party, so if you don't mind spending a little extra money you don't have to wait in line outside for you have a table reserved, its not first come first serve seating if you don't want it to be. I also noticed changes in the wait staff, they seemed more comfortable, confident, less stressed and on the ball the evening we had visited. Our waiter was very sharp, courteous, knowledgeable with the menu and drinks and very quick with our orders.  I appreciate the attention, care and kindness the owner and all the managers showed me, this business is looking to succeed and they truly believe in customer satisfaction. We had a wonderful evening and will be visiting again in the future. Keep it up Stand Up!

Yummy!!!! This dive bar is pretty cool! Very low key, good place to go to grab a bite or a beer. I enjoyed their Juan Pablo burger and onion rings. I couldn't believe how delicious the burger was, coming from this dive bar! I didn't expect much and was blown away! It was a 1/2 lb burger with pepper jack cheese, pablano pepper and chipotle mayo. The combination of all that together was awesomeness in my mouth! The onion rings, were not as crispy as I usually like them, but my friend downed them in about 5 seconds, so I think they were pretty tasty to him.  Cheap drinks, good food, laid back atmosphere...... fun place to go to!

Love this place!!!! The owners are absolutely wonderful, very friendly and love what they do! Every time we come here there is a line out the door, but it's worth the wait and they work very fast to make sure the line is constantly moving! There are a ton of different flavors to choose from..... you cant come here and not find anything you don't like! There is something for everyone!  Absolutely recommend the Sea Salt Carmel...... never tasted another flavor of gelato better than this!  Keep it up Frost!

I had to get a rental car while my car was in the shop from a car accident I was in. Enterprise did a fantastic job getting me all taken care of through my insurance company. After I dropped my car off at the shop, Enterprise came and picked me up and drove me to their location. At this time I filled out all the paper work and got to pick out my rental car. Everything was nice and easy and no hassle at all. I signed the paperwork, checked out the car and was on my way! The car was nice and clean, ran great and I had no problems with it at all.  A week later, I returned the car as easily as I rented it. Every employee was very nice and helpful! It was nice to have one thing go so smoothly, while my car was being worked on and having all kinds of problems with the shop it was at and my insurance company.  If I need to rent a car again, I will definitely keep this location in mind!

Well this place is fun!!! If your a beer lover this place is a MUST! I am hoping my bff signs up to brew his beer here and he releases it for his bday! So much fun for a beer lover like him. If you are interested in brewing your own beer here, give them a call! Its pretty sweet!! The staff here is very lively, attentive and nice! Nothing like hanging out with friends and crackin jokes with your bartender, or wait staff. On top of all these things they also have great food. We came for their morning special, which is a beer or mimosa along with a few specific dishes for only $10. Can beat that!!! Try their breakfast flat bread, it is delicious! Its been super nice outsdie too, so I recommend going out back and sitting out on the patio! Plenty of shade, fans and misters to keep you cool! Cant wait to go back!!

Vintage Housekeeping has done a wonderful job on my new home! I recently just bought a house and needed a good deep clean before we moved in! Vintage did a fantastic job! They showed up on time with a crew of about 6 people to tackle the house! They did every room from top to bottom (besides the floors as requested by me) and I couldn't have done a better job myself! It took about 2 hours and It was definitely affordable! They saved me a lot of time and hassle of doing it myself. I will be contacting them again to set me up on a once a month service! :D Great job! Thank you so much ladies!!

In the mood for Mexican and in old town shopping around, why not try Barrio Queen!? This place wasn't very busy on a Saturday early afternoon which was really nice! Its a cute little Mexican Food place, gives off the normal ambiance, but what makes it a little cooler and catches your eye when your walking by, is their large patio area. They have a few outside tables along the side of their building and a larger covered area out back. Set up perfect for the weather we have been having lately. As soon as we stepped inside, everyone was very kind and helpful, this was our first visit, so they told us a little about the restaurant, the menu and their drinks.  We stopped by for just a small quick bite, so we order 3 small tacos, the carnitas, Al Pastor and the Carne Asada and oddly some mimosa's to go with them! Who said you can't have tacos and mimosas for brunch!?? LOL! Our waiter was very nice, informative, and attentive and actually made our morning better with how friendly and smiley he was. They always say if you smile at someone, it rubs off! It definitely did and he really helped make our morning! I feel awful for not remembering his name  The tacos were small which we knew going in, so if you are hungry I would order a few, but they were definitely delicious! The meat all tasted good, the onion and cilantro was all fresh, tortillas were fresh and warm! Great tacos!  Wonderful food, wonderful staff, cool place, had a great time!

I am very skeptical about car wash places now a days because it seems that most companies just care about getting the car in and out as soon as possible. So I have hand washed and cleaned my cars for years! Companies really don't take the time or effort to actually get in the nooks and crannies of the car to get it cleaned. My mind was changed once I visited this car wash. I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman named Mark. He was able to give me information on which car wash would be best and answered all my additional questions about getting my seats shampooed. It was time for my car to have a nice little make over, for my son has made it quit a mess with fishies, chocolate and muddy shoe prints. With discussing options with Mark I felt very comfortable on the car wash choice and the price. I was able to get one of the nicer (more options) car washes and he shampooed the whole inside of my car for only $35, to me that was a great deal for what I needed done. He was also very courteous when I asked him to please park my car in the sun with the windows cracked so the seats could dry and I would drop by after work to pick it up. When I came back to pick my car up, it was parked in the sun, locked and the windows were cracked. I was able to pick up my car looking and smelling brand new. The company did everything I asked for. To my surprise when I got in my car, everything was cleaned and looked great! No streaks, no spots, vacuumed perfectly.... I couldn't have done a better job myself! Thanks a lot to Mark and his team for changing my mind on car washes!

First time visiting a five guys! Can you believe it!? I stopped here for a friend who was craving it and so glad he was, because it was delicious! The burgers are made fresh right in front of you, along with any buildable burger toppings you want (mushrooms, onions, ketchup etc). Frys, shakes...... great burger joint! Good flavor, cooked how you want it. If you are looking for a fast food burger, stop by one of their locations. Nice and quick, clean and really nice staff. Keep it up guys!

This place is fantastic. I went here a few days ago and was really blown away. It looks "ok" from the outside, a little ran down and kind of shoved back behind RnR off the corner, we weren't expecting much. Little did we know when we walked in how cool, fun and delicious this place would be. It's definitely got the Cali feel to it, with pics on the walls, bikes, surf boards, and fish tanks on the TV! It's really neat the way they gave this tiny place such a big Cali feel.  The place was packed on a Sunday early afternoon, so we sat at the bar. I ordered the chicken pesto pasta and my friend ordered the hangover burger. It didn't take long for the food to get out to us, while waiting we people watched and enjoyed our beverages! The food was AMAZING!!!! The pesto had a weird mix to it, when I ate a bite with no chicken it was meh, on the ok side, but when I added a piece of their marinated chicken in the mix my taste buds went bananas! It was crazy! I started laughing so hard because the chicken brought out so much more flavor of the pesto sauce! Man am I becoming a foodie. Their hang over burger was to die for. It sounds weird at first, but then when you think about it, you're trying to figure out why no one has combined eggs, bacon, colby jack cheese and green chili on top of some deliciously cooked hamburger before! I had one bite of my friend's hamburger and I was hooked. We both started chowing down like we hadn't eaten in days! I didn't think this lunch could get any better, until I checked in and noticed a coupon for their brownies! Ahhhhh man that did us in! The brownie came out super hot (watch your tongue ouchy) with some recess chocolate pieces in it, with of course ice cream on top.....DELICIOUS! I literally don't remember the drive home because I was in a food coma from this place! My friend was lucky they didn't have to roll me out the door!  I can't wait to go back! This place is awesome!!!! Keep it up Rehab, you definitely showed me what I have been missing out on!  PS - Staff was fantastic! Everyone was so happy, smiling, courteous, and helpful, it was awesome! Not one sad face in the whole house! You don't see that much anymore! You're staff is awesome!

I am not sure exactly how I feel about Firehouse yet. I feel like I need to go back and have a redo, for my first impression might be a wee bit biased. I stopped here for my sister and decided to go ahead and try it out. She loves it and cant get enough of it. I ended up ordering 4 sandwiches for me and my family. Unfortunately, I think at this time they were a little under staffed for there were a lot of people waiting in the dining room and the 2 employees working, were rushing like crazy. I ended up waiting 20 minutes for 4 sandwiches. I was in a hurry, so I was super annoyed, so this might be why my review is biased. When I finally got home, I felt like my sandwich was mediocre, nothing to rave about. A ton of people say Firehouse is WAY better than Quiznos or Subway....... but at those places I have never waited 20 minutes for a mehhhh sandwich. My family loved their subs, but my turkey, ham and bacon sub, was just meh.  This place is right down the street from my house and my sister eats here once a week, so Ill have to give it another try and see what happens. First visits aren't always the best, so you always owe it to yourself and the business to try again, because you never know. Well unless everything about the first visit was horrible. Haha!

This place is really cool! I ran into this place on accident while on a bike ride around Scottsdale. This place is a quaint little house/restaurant on the corner of a block, with a huge backyard/patio area. There is not a lot of "decorations" inside to create an actual theme, just very basic nothing really created. They have a TV, tables and chairs set around a pretty decent size rooms. The patio area is beautiful! They have a fountain in the corner, the brick fence is covered in vines, there are very large trees to create shade and they have hung lights around the outside to create a relaxing ambiance. Its nothing spectacular, but simple and peaceful, even with it being right next to a main road. They have a pretty decent menu from the basic tacos and burritos, to vampiros! I had a carne asada taco and a carne asada vampire, both were very good. The meat had a good flavor too it, and I am not a huge guacamole fan, but their guacamole gave the taco and the tostada a really nice kick. I also ordered a side of chips and bean dip. The bean dip was a little bland, but it was nice to have real style Mexican bean did, then the refried Americanized bean dip. I took a little bit of the hot sauce and the guacamole from my taco and added it to to bean dip and it was delicious.  This is acute little place to stop by if your in the neighborhood looking for an easy breakfast, lunch or dinner! I definitely recommend the vampire (basically a tostada) and enjoying the nice AZ weather out on their patio!

I took my car in for an oil change and an AC Check. The manager behind the counter was quite helpful and nice. I was able to get my car in without an appointment and got a courtesy call to come and pick it up in 2 hours. I didn't have an appointment so I was expecting a long wait, I was told they may have to keep my car all day, but I understood because I didn't have an appointment. I passed my keys along, signed the paperwork and left. Two hours go by and I received a call that my car was ready to be picked up! That was fast, I was very surprised with them being done with my car already.   They did a great job, kept my car clean and gave me a full report on what they did. They did everything I asked for, didn't try pushing services I didn't want and made me feel comfortable. A lot of mechanic places try to "persuade" women into things they don't need. Luckily I know my cars, so persuading me has never happened. I didn't have to have my guard up here; they respected me and just did what I asked them to do. Great customer service at affordable prices! Good online deals!  Thanks for taking care of my car Brake Masters Ill be back!

Pretty cool place! Great customer service, friendly staff, neat idea of the way its set up, build your own enchiladas! The only thing I would want to change a little is to add rice and beans to the enchiladas (like on the side) I love enchiladas but I need a little more variety. Eating a huge bowl of just enchiladas gets a little bland. Other than that, definitely recommend it for people to try!

My family and I always have a nice time when we come here! The weather is perfect right now!! Take it while you can, before it gets hot!! I love traveling to this park probably because it reminds me of the good old days when I was young! Its right across the street from my old high school so I know this park well! Haha!  The park alone is very spacious and always clean! There are a few different fields to play soccer or football, they have huge basketball courts, a few volley ball courts, a few different playgrounds for children, a ton of benches and tables (covered and non covered) a nice little lake and a few trails that travel around the lake. There is so much to do here, spending just an hour isn't enough, walking around the lake on one of the paths could easily take an hour (depending on how fast you walk of course)   When I was younger I would come here to jog, the paths are perfect and its nice to "get away" a little by running one of the paths that travel behind the lake into the desert area. Now I like to come here because my son and my friend's dog love to run around together. There is a leash policy for pets because this isn't a dog park, but if its not too busy we just let them run around. The great thing about the little lake is it's filled with fish. So if you take all the required measures to fish, you are more than welcome to prop up a little chair under a nice shady tree and cast a line!  Good times!!!

I went to this gym for a few months when it first opened. The owner is really nice, you can tell he is dedicated in helping each person that visits his gym. Crossfit is definitely not a slacker gym, so if you are really looking to better yourself health and body wise this gym is one of the best to go to. Every Crossfit gym is different, for I have been to a few and by far this one was my favorite because of the coaches. The coaches make the difference when it comes to Crossfit, because you need to be pushed to your specific max and if you have coaches that don't pay attention and really don't care you can hurt yourself or not work yourself out hard enough. I have left this gym throwing up (in a good way) the best part was, I had more energy, I had toned every inch of my body and I added muscle. I felt like I had my dancer body I use to have back in high school and this was after I had my son! This gyms motto for the ladies is "If you still look cute after your workout, you didn't go hard enough!" Great motivation for the ladies out there. If your looking to work hard and go big I would recommend this gym.

Great little place in Mesa! They cook their meats right up front behind the cashiers, so the smoke gets a little much at times, but they keep it ventilated as best as they can. Decent prices, meat taste really good, great refried beans and yummy salsa. Over all 4 1/2 stars. Make sure you stop by between normal lunch and dinner times because it gets pretty busy!

There are a ton of places to eat in Vegas, Bubba Gump happened to be on our list because they have an outside balcony patio that we could sit at and look over the strip and my sister has never been here before. When we first got here the customer service was fantastic, everyone is smiling as they greet you and show you the way to be seated. After hiking up some stairs and walking for a bit, alas the hostess to seat us! We were sat within 5 minutes and greeted by our waiter. The drinks here are WAY over priced and the food was bleh....... the drinks were very weak and cost us about $16 each for one regular mixed drink in a regular sized glass, a beer was $13...... ouch! The food was very bland and just...... well bleh. No taste, no flavor, no yummy to it at all. I remembered the Bubba Gump in SF being WAY BETTER! Definitely disappointed in this visit. Along with the cheap food and expensive drinks came panic at the end of our meal. I paid with a $100 bill and made sure I told the waitress it was a $100 bill, she brought be back change as if I paid with a $50, then disappeared. After talking to 2 other waiters, they finally found my original waitress and she pulled the rest of my change out of her coin purse, her actual personal coin purse and said "oh im sorry I must have counted that wrong, let me get you change from my tips" its ok to miscount money I understand, but why would you have put it in your personal bag and not in the cash register, and why would you be paying me back in your tips!??? I didn't say keep the change and leave you a large tip..... so why wasn't I given exact change? So that was weird and not fun, the whole dinner was just disappointing, time consuming (for service was super slow) and having to hunt for my money back is just a pain.  Spend your money and time somewhere else!

ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR AWESOMENESS GOES OUT TO ALPINE SKI CLUB!!!  A group of friends and I just got back from a trip to Telluride booked by Alpine Ski Club. I was a little nervous at first, for I am use to planning my vacations myslef. Well now that I have gone through Alpine Ski Club, I may just get use to someone else planning my new adventures. I can't think of one complaint nor was I disappointed the whole weekend we were away!   When you first book your trip you have to pay a small deposit and then a month before your trip you have to pay in full. I really liked that Alpine has this "payment plan" for if you have the cash upfront you can pay in full or you can make payments. We had a friend drop out last minute and Lee was very understanding, we were able to replace our original person with a new person for a small fee. It was nice to be able to just give them the new persons name and know they would take care of everything else.   The meeting place in Phoenix was perfect, the bus driver was great and the long journey seemed to go by pretty quickly. Our trip captain was very funny and knowledgeable about Telluride which was nice for me for I have never been and was educated on a few things! We stayed in the Lulu Condos in Telluride, the room was perfect for our group, it had a full kitchen, living room, 2 full bedrooms and a loft with 2 beds. We also had a hot tub right out the main door which was perfect to relax in after a long day of snowboarding! Last the location was great because their was a lift up the mounatin right accross the street from our room, a grocery store right around the corner and downtown Telluride only walking distance away!  You get a lot of BANG for your BUCK with this company and they don't let you down! Thank you goes out to Lee and Alpine Ski Club for such a fantastic mini vacation! I will definitely be coming back next year!!!

Can I get a sweet jesus or even a hell ya!!! Best hot dog I have EVER had!!!  This place is super cute! I love the way it's set up, very open, fits a ton of people, cute little patio out front, they have a convenient drive through and have a great mix of old school/Chicago decor, set up in a modern way (if that makes any sense)  The menu is larger then I thought it would be there are salads, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and of course hot dogs!! I decided to go with the Jumbo Chili Dog, Cheese fries and a drink! Wish I had room for dessert, or a chocolate shake! Definitely going to order that next time! A lot of places over cook hot dogs, or have awful tasting chili they pile on top. It's nice to actually get a perfectly cooked/juicy hot dog, on a delicious seasoned bun, with flavorful chili! Ohhh and the fries! I LOVE crinkle fries.... a lot of places stopped serving them! Portillos hit home with me with the crinkle fires! Nice and crispy, crunchy, the way crinkle fries should taste!  Overall great experience! This place is very laid back, casual, family and date friendly! The staff is very courteous and welcoming! Worth the lines and the kayos! I recommend going later at night around 9pm is when we went (I know that is late to eat) but there were no lines, received our food in about 5 minutes, sat and enjoyed each others company while people watching and took the long drive home!  This specific location is about and hour away from my house, but certainly worth the drive! I can't wait for them to open up their new location this summer at Tempe Market Place!  Great night! Thanks for finally making it to AZ Portillos!

Pretty awesome place! 4 stars for "attractions" they have a pretty decent arcade, laser tag, laser maze, jungle gym, bumper cars, mini bowling, bowling and pool tables. 3 stars for food, it isn't awful, but its also not great. They have a decent menu but think along bowling alley food/small bar taste. 3 star on price unfortunately, if you don't come on a night they have a special running or you come on the weekends, prepare yourself for spending an arm and a leg and waiting in longer lines for the attractions. I came here last night with my son and a few of his friends for his bday. I think I ended up spending about $125 by the end of the night. This included attraction cards for each kid, arcade cards, food and drinks, we stayed about 3 hours. Office staff was nice, helpful and the place was clean and safe. If you can come on a weekday night and try avoiding weekends its less hectic (think of amazing jakes/peter piper as one and 3 times as busy)

Joyride is a really cool place! I recommend going on Taco Tuesday, for they have specails! It is a laid back open atmosphere, kind of on the hipster side, friendly attentive staff and a decent size menu. I recommend their carne asada tacos, guac and chips and if you are not in the mood for tacos, their enchiladas are pretty tasty. AZ is finally having some awesome weather, go sit out on the patio and have some good food!

Love this place, so much fun! This is mostly an outside bar, but there is an inside if you don't want to sit in "AZ Cold" weather lol! They have the heating vents placed all around the outside, lights hanging, music playing, chairs, tables, couches and of course, it is decorated for Christmas...... lots of fun! The Perch has its own brewery in the back, so if you like different beers, this place is a good place to try! Their food selection is OK, not fantastic, but decent. I like to go more for the atmosphere, enjoy the nice weather, listen to live music and catch up with friends! This place is very random and different, one of the main reasons I like it so much! Its also right in down town chandler, so if you like Christmas light looking, you can check that out down town after you're done enjoying this place! Have fun!!!

I am about 3 weeks post-op from a breast augmentation with Dr. Olsen. I have been looking into getting one for years and have visited a few different doctors. After my consultation with him I finally decided to go ahead and do it. He was very informative, he wasn't worried about "pitching" me, what I should and shouldn't do, he started off informing me about the procedure and answered all my questions. He made me feel very comfortable and not rushed, I felt like he cared to help me with what I was looking for, not another patient in and out the door. He also took the time to describe what he does, how he does it and why he does it the way he does without pressuring you to do what he thinks or wants you to do, its your decision and he voices his opinions, concerns and facts. Having an actual discussion and not a sales pitch, I knew he was the one for me. The office staff is also very nice and helpful, I think I spoke with Jane and Brittany multiple times, with different questions. Every time I have called or visited they have taken good care of me. Everyone's body is different in the way surgery goes, healing process, it can all vary, but so far I am satisfied with everything. The surgery center was nice, the nurses, the anesthesiologist, everything from start to finish was nice and smooth. The healing process is always a bit rough, but I am doing good! Thank you to everyone at APSI and thank you Dr. Olsen!  Ohhh and on a BIG side note, I appreciated the night after my surgery Dr. Olsen called me himself to check to see how I was doing. At that time I was good, but the next morning I was in a lot of pain. I unfortunately text him at like 6am with my concerns thinking it would take hours to hear back, if even at all on a Saturday morning and he got back to me within 2 minutes! Who does that!??? A doctor who cares, that's who! I really appreciated that on a Saturday morning, he was so nice to help me and with his suggestions made my problem 10 times better. Thanks so much for that!

Had an great time at this race! It was another FUN RUN I participated in with a few of my friends. The race itself was set-up well, easy to register, not a bad price, reminder e-mails, information emails, not once did I feel like I was left hanging trying to get prepared for this run. Packet pick up was easy and quick nothing much to worry about.  The day of the race, parking was a snap ($10 was a little pricey to park your car) we got in parked and walked right through the gate. Our start time was 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, but we were able to be released with the 1:00 start time, because we were in the last large wave.  The run itself was set up well, having to run some and get through obstacles. The way they set up the spacing between obstacles was nice, for if you were tired from an obstacle you could run or walk to the next one to take a little break. There are a lot of different kind of athletes that run these fun races. People who go to have a good time and run/walk, people who like the obstacles but don't run at all, and people who get through the run and obstacles as fast as possible. So no matter what kind of athlete you are, you can take it at your own pace and everyone has a good time. With their being obstacles, you of course have some kind of backup/wait at each obstacle but its not too bad. You can catch your breath and chit chat with people while waiting in line. The obstacles were very fun and different from any other run I have participated in. You had monkey bars, a big wall to go up and over, large barriers that you had to get over/hurdle, slides to climb up then slide down, blow up slides that got you wet and covered in foam, a large and long bouncy obstacle you had to bounce through to get to the other side, the wrecking ball, where you had to travel through water on a small path without getting hit by two large balls on a crane swinging at you and last but not least the largest inflatable waterslide to cross the finish line. This race was basically like the show Wipe Out!  In the end everything that had to do with the actual race was awesome! They do really need to spruce up their after party and have better vendors working there. The beer ladies were all terribly rude, the food options were yuck and the DJ didn't get the crowd pumped at all. Those few things along with a better t-shirt design I think the race would have been perfect!!!! Hopefully some better things to come next yr!  Thanks for the fun run ROC!

ROC RACE 2014!!!! YEEEEEHHHAWWWWWW! I love that you added a few new obstacles, I love that the course was different than last year and I love that you did smaller waves of people for the run! Everything went a lot smoother, lines were shorter, obstacles were funner (yes I just used that word! HAHA!) Great job! I definitely look forward to attending next years run! Keep it up! :D

Dr. Allen has been the best pediatrician for my little guy! The doctors office use to be called, East Valley Pediatrics, I believe they recently changed to Banner sometime this year. Each time I have to bring my son in for a sick visit or a well visit we never have any problems. The staff is nice and friendly as soon as you walk in the door, it's always a plus being greeted with a happy tone and smile! The lobby has a TV always playing children's movies, to occupy the kids and they have a sick room. It's nice that they have this separate room for kids to play in if they are sick, so they don't spread germs to the kids who are there for other reasons. I understand with children's doctors appointments, things can take time, especially if something major is going on, so our wait usually is in our room in the back, which is a lot longer wait then out front in the lobby. Dr. Allen has always been friendly, caring, knowledgeable and sweet to my son and me. It's nice to have a doctor who actually asks questions, listens and makes you feel like they care for the wellbeing of the patient then treating you like another body going through their office. My son was a preemie, so she always made sure she took extra care of him to make sure he hit all his milestones and has always given us information (as first time parents) for what to watch out for in infant preemies. My son is now a very happy and healthy 3 year old and his last check up was perfect! I think Dr. Allen will be seeing my son for quite some time!  Thanks for having a great staff and a great doctor! Dr. Allen you are the best!

This is a really nice place and the staff is very friendly, but I have experienced better. I made sure I called in the morning and made a late afternoon appointment for me, my sister and my niece for my nieces birthday. She wanted to get her toes done, so I thought it would be fun for all of us to get it done together. When we got there, right around our appointment time, they were slammed. Yes I understand they randomly get busy with different people and different parties, hence the reason I made an appointment. After waiting a half hour after our appointment time, they put me and my niece together and put my sister clear over on the other side. So we weren't all able to talk and visit while getting our toes done like I wanted to. Our pedicures were also rushed and I feel like done half..... you know what. They did this because they were busy and had to get everyone in. My niece and I ended up getting done 20 minutes before my sister so we had to wait another 20 minutes to leave. It just wasn't the great bonding experience we wanted for my nieces bday. There is no point in going in a group and making an appointment when nothing is accomodated. Also it shouldn't take 2 hours to get 3 pedicures done, especially with making an appointment! It threw off the rest of my nieces bday plans for the evening! Really disappointed.

Great stadium!! All the park food and drinks you can think of, they take both debit and cash at the stands. Many choices in beers, even hard alcohol! The food is pricey along with the drinks, you have to expect that though for any game. We got the cheap seats in outfield on the grass, it was perfect!!! Bring a towel or blanket and a hat, sit out and get a tan while you watch the cubs play! It was the Cubs so of course the game was sold out and the stadium was packed, but it wasn't bad at all. A lot of room, a lot of vendors, large bathrooms, so no lines! The only problem you run into is the shop, very busy, long check out line, I recommend shopping while the game is still going on to avoid the crowd. Nice, clean..... had a great time!!! GO CUBS!

Im not a religious person, but I work with a lot of people who are Mormon, so with all the buzz around the office I had to go check out this LDS Gilbert Temple, while the open house was going on. WOW! This place is amazing!!!! The architecture is outstanding, marble floors, silk, crystals; no expense was spared when building this temple. I cant believe how elegant and breathtaking everything is. It took a lot of skilled people to put together this building and they definitely deserve massive recognition! I also would like to thank all the volunteers who made this open house possible, everyone was very kind, helpful and happy. Not once were we asked nor bothered about joining the Mormon faith, you can just come and look at it if you are curious and of course stay and ask question if you are interested in joining! LOL!   If you haven't had a chance to make it out and look at this amazing building, if you're religious or not, it is a sight worth seeing!

This place is AWESOME! Being on and from the East side, we run out of things to do, usually all the cool stuff is on the West side in either Scottsdale or Phoenix. Having something close that is fun to do is a cool change of pace! This place is an outdoor course for both paintball and air soft guns. They have everything you need, so if you are a newbie you can go without any gear and they will get you taken care of! The prices are decent for rentals and you can pay one fee and play for as long as they are open for the day. It's pretty hot out right now, so I would definitely recommend going as soon as they open. By 10am we were sweating our butts off and ready to leave after about 5 games. If you are a girl, don't worry, it doesn't hurt too much at all! I would suggest wearing a long sleeve shirt and some pants for your first few times! Once you get better you can show some more skin, but bear skin will bruise a lot easier then covered skin. Also get one of the chest guards, to protect more of your body. I got shot a few times and only left with one good bruise, really didn't hurt at all! I can't wait to go again! The people who work here are very nice, happy and have a good time!  Side note - There are some people who take this game seriously, so if you go out for your first time and just for fun, try to stay out of their way so they can enjoy themselves too. They aren't rude, but they are determined to WIN! So watch out! Haha! And ladies..... no potty..... so be prepared to hold it or cop a squat!  :)

Pretty cool place! They definitely hit the theme research, I like that they stuck with it through out the restaurant. Your beer testers come in little beaker jars and their lighting is custom with lab flask! Very unique. Not only do they serve different types of beers (not your bud light kind of place) they brew a few different ones themselves. Pretty decent selection! As far as food goes, I wouldn't recommend the tacos, but definitely try a burger! The pub burger to be exact! Huge, pilled on with bacon, eggs, it was delicious! Stop by and give this local place a try! Ohhh and if you can sit in the section with the waiter with the awesome monopoly man mustache, do it! He was very attentive, nice, funny and lets face it, has the coolest mustache I have ever seen! LOL! Im sorry I cant remember his name, but BRI give that guy a raise! :D

THe portion sizes are HUGE so if you dont want to leave overly stuffed share with a friend. I had their philly cheese steak sandwhich and chili cheese fries...... mmmmmm! Lets just say my mom had to roll me outta there when I was done eating! Stop bye you dont be dissapointed.

This place has SOOOOO MUCH potential, but honestly, its sad how bad it is! Being a video game bar, you would think they would have taken the time to put all the wires in the wall, but they are out and hanging around. If you want something to drink, make sure its basic and comes in a bottle. Anything outside of a normal beer, the bartenders have no idea what your are talking about. I asked if they had Salior Jerrys, the kid had no idea what it was and asked me what type of alcohol it was. They didnt have it, so I said ok any rum and coke.... he then said ummm would this Bacardi kind be of for you? It would have been easier if I walked around the bar and poured the drink myself. Now for the food, YUCK! I expected it to not be grand at all, but to pay $8 for burnt cheese sticks, really! How do you mess up cheese sticks!! You probably got them out of a frozen bag and dumped them into the fryer.....easy!! Yet you didn't watch them, so you served them obviously burnt. They were BLACK! And you still served them!! I think the business could really benefit, if they hired a real bartender, kitchen staff and a business manager to help clean up their act! Maybe charge a small fee for hourly play, something to bring in money to get that place rockin! It has real potential and you want it to be so good, so it sticks around. If they keep headed this direction, it wont stay open long. Other than all that, they have a decent selection of different game consoles and a good list of games to choose from.

I have been going to this dermatologist for a few months now and I have to say this office has helped me out the most and is really great! The staff is always polite, friendly and fun. Each time I have gone in here, I haven't had to wait too long for my appointment time, the nurses are always polite and the doctor is very informative, she is just wonderful. She has been able to help clear up my acne and has actually gotten it to not come back as much as it use to. I hate adult acne, its such a pain in the butt and you hope you don't have to deal with it once you graduate high school, but JUST KIDDING, you can have it when you are old too! Dang it! I really appreciate the front desk lady, she is always so friendly and super fun with my son when he comes to my appointments with me. He says she gives out the best stickers!!! Haha! Great office! Highly reccomend!

Well this place is super fun! Not only does it carry the great drinks and food from Culinary Drop Out, you get a completely different atmosphere then the normal restaurants and bars. First off, most of the place is outside, under shade of course, has 2 large bars, ton of places to sit and to top it off all kinds of games! Yes games, cornhole, ping pong.... its really entertaining to watch people play or get a group together and play while having a few drinks! Downside is this place is always packed and you have to get their early to be able to play any of the games, or wait a while for your turn. Another plus, huge TV's everywhere, so if you wanna catch a game you definitely can! Its a mix of hipsters, college students, corporate people, sometimes families with kids, it has a little bit of everything for everyone. Great food, decent service, awesome atmosphere! Good place to kick back, relax and enjoy your time out!

Ummmmmm yeah!!!! So from what I know there are 2 Top Golfs in the city, one in Scottsdale and one in Gilbert. I never had a chance to make it out to the Scottsdale one, but if its like the one in Gilbert, I finally understand what all the hype is about! This place is so much fun, whether you like to golf or not! There are 3 stories full of bays to golf from that are set up for single players or large group of players. They have a bar/seating area inside if you don't want to play golf or if you have to wait for a bay, you have something else to do. They also have an outside bar/seating area on the 3rd floor. If the place is packed like it was the night we went, they open up their banquet hall so people have more room to sit and eat.  Food - They have a really decent menu! Lots to chose from. Pizza, burgers, wings, tacos, salads....... yummy! I had their nachos and their buffalo chicken sliders! The nachos are delicious, large chips layered in your choice of meat, cheese, bean puree, this chimichurri sauce.... it was delicious! The buffalo chicken sliders were also very tasty! Spicy wing sauce, served with lettuce, tomato and ranch.  Atmosphere - Very fun, laid back, good for dates, singles and families  Service - Great service! The night we went a pro football player rented out the entire 3rd floor for a Gopro special, so it was packed! Not only was there enough staff to take care of peoples golfing needs, there was enough to greet people when we entered, exited, for valet parking, servers, bar tenders, everyone was on the ball and all smiles!  Overall we had a great time!! Cant wait to go back!  Good side note - You do have to purchase a one time golf card for $5 when you first go, you pay by the hour for your games. Each game is about 20 swings per person. If its your first time a concierge will walk you to your bay and help set you up.

SOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN!!!!! Dallen, thank you so much for making my moms Bachlorette party such a good time. So excited I found this place on Yelp months ago and was finally able to go. Basically you get locked in a room with friends or strangers depending on which room you choose and you all have to work together on finding clues, figuring them out and getting out of the locked room in just 60 min! We were able to get out of the rec room in 53 minutes, just in time!! The way everything is set up, the way they do the clues and how everything works is really fun! I dont want to give anything away, that would take all the fun out of it! This is a good time for team building for businesses, or just a night out with friends, you will have a blast trying to figure everything out! Highly recommend!!

I HATE having to leave this review because the Portillos in Scottsdale blew me away when I first heard of this chain. My 1st visit to this Portillos in Tempe, was this past weekend. I was super excited for I was traveling from QC to Scottsdale and new this location had just opened and I had to pass it to get to my friends house! Why not try it out since the other location is out of the way and FAR from me! I was soooo super excited I think I may have exceeded the speed limit to get there! LOL! The drive through was pretty thorough and awesome when I arrived. You had very nice (but crazy people, because they are standing outside all day in this heat) taking your order. I ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries. My ordered was confirmed by at least 3 different people walking down the drive through taking orders and by the person who collects payment; they were all very nice and quick. I pulled up to the last person who brought me my order (even repeated my exact order back to me), super happy my order came out before the 2 cars ahead of me (how nice and fast) left the drive through and rushed to my friends to devour my delicious food. When I got home and opened up my bad of deliciousness I was completely disappointed!!! Immediate sad face! I received the wrong order! You know the feeling you get when your parents tell you you're going to Disneyland and they end up taking you to the doctor instead? It felt like that, the build up of awesomeness, then the tremendous sadness in the end! I was so sad and frustrated, for you are looking forward in enjoying a delicious meal and you receive an order you don't even want. I received a regular hot dog with mustard.... it would have been fine and I wouldn't be upset if I liked mustard, if I liked mustard a tiny bit, but I completely cant stand the taste of mustard, I hate it. I tried scraping the mustard off the hot dog and throwing the bun away, but it still had its mustard taste, so I tossed it! My chili cheese fries ended up being normal fries, so I ate those and pouted! I know things happen in the drive through ever now and then, it was just frustrating for my order was repeated to me so many times, there was no way I felt I even needed to check it before I left the drive through. Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating. It's a waste of money and then a waste of gas to drive back to get my correct order. I will try to give Tempe another chance if I am in the area and checking my order every time will be a must now! You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :(

I dont understand what the hype is all about. We waited an hour Saturday around 10:30am. It was packed. We sat outside (after waiting for an hour outside) in the sun. Its too hot to have tables outside in the sun with no misters. We were able to sit half way in the shade after a while, but still didnt help with the heat. Service was mediocre, ran out of water a few times and had to flag people down for re-fills, ordered the omelette..... nothing but grease. Hash browns had no taste to them at all....... just really not worth the hype or the wait. I think its just busy because its a newer place in old town Gilbert. Dont let it fool you, honestly if you are going to wait an hour, it should be worth it!

Yummy yummy yummy I got GREAT sushi in my tummy!!! This place is fantastic!! I mean worth more than a 5 star!!! The staff is very friendly, the place itself is small but put together very well, very clean and has a relaxed atmosphere. Their menu is pretty large, all kinds of different rolls to chose from, sashimi, salads,  soups, kids platters..... something for everyone. They have a really good happy hour, different hot and cold saki, saki bombs, beer and wine. I was really glad I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot! The sushi was so fresh and tasty, no problems at all, like heaven in my mouth! It was really nice to go to a place that has 5 star food and 5 star service! Now I know why almost every review is 5 stars, they are truly a 5 star place! Cant wait to go back when I get another sushi craving, think this is going to be my new sushi spot!!

Still having opening pains?? Went here on a Sunday for the firs time, wasn't very busy. It is a very large place, very open and spacious on the inside, great patio on the outside. They have a few different tables outside to play games, open kitchen (you can see into kitchen) a few different bars, lots of tables and TV's spread throughout. It reminds me a lot of The Yard. The only reason I give the 2 stars is very poor service. I am not sure if our server was the only one working on Sunday or if it was an off day. He was polite and tried taking care of us, it just took a very long time to get drinks and refills. I also had higher hopes on the food, the food is meh...... not a very large menu, so not a lot to choose from. I ordered the wings, nothing really fantastic about them, they also weren't horrible. My girlfriend ordered one of their burgers, but only ate half of it. Decent beer selection, obviously its a brewery, good drink deals on the weekends. Not sure if this place is on my list to try again though.

Well most of these reviews are about the staff, my review is about the food. This is a new restaurant in Queen Creek people, you are going to wait AT LEAST an hour for a table and staff is going to be on the fritz for a little until they get their groove down. This happens every time a new place opens up out here, so we decided to get it to go, smarter choice so we thought. I ordered lunch about 12:15 figuring it would be a while for them to make it, so our pick up time was 1:15 (an hour for a to go order, ouch). When we picked up our food at 1:10, nothing was hot, you could tell it was made a while ago and was just sitting out waiting for us to pick up, if you are going to tell us a prompt pick up time, don't let the food sit out forever. We already waited in line to get our to go order, I wasn't going to send the food back. Got it home, yep, ice cold!  I got the pesto pasta, my boyfriend got the regular spaghetti with sausage, my sister got a pizza and my son got a slice of pizza. After we all re-heated our food, we finally got to eat. Unfortunately I only took about 3 bites of my food and I threw it away. The cheese was hard (even after I warmed it up) because it had been sitting out at the restaurant too long so it made the pasta really dry, there was hardly any sauce which made it taste really bland and I couldn't eat any of the bread bowl it came in because it was rock hard and stale. My boyfriends spaghetti was ok, nothing special about it, the sausage was nice and spicy so that was good. My sisters pizza was also tasteless (you're a pizza place, how does a pepperoni pizza not taste good!?) Then last my sons cheeses pizza, cold and hard as a rock. Luckily he's 5 so pizza is pizza, he was the only one who ate all their food. Oregano's I know you just opened and things are rough at the beginning, having poor staff is one thing, but serving awful food....... come on!? A waste of $50 on family dinner, ended up having to cook something because everyone was still hungry.

So second day open...... Not awful, not great. You can tell the restaurant is still working out some kinks which we knew would probably happen. A lot of mishaps with our meal order and drink orders, 4 different servers..... And a lot of confusion. We were patient and understanding having a good time hanging out. The set-up at this BWW is pretty cool, the bar is in the middle, surrounded by dining tables on the outside, nice and open, big TV's, pretty cool place and different from the others. We are excited to come back in a few weeks when they get it together a little better. Our server said the manager would comp a bit of our bill for the problems, but the way they compt it was giving us a free cake, appreciated, but still charged us for food we didn't even get!? Second day open and you already ran out of one of your specials! I don't know.... It was a bit confusing so we just were patient, paid and left. See you guys in a bit with hopefully an updated review! :)
