I'm on a quest to find the best hot wings in Phoenix; so far Teakwoods is at the top of the list - plus you get to chuck peanuts on the floor, and the staff were really friendly and helpful.  Beer was ice cold; can't go wrong with that.

Wow - finally a pizzeria that reminds you of a New York slice - until now, we haven't found anything in town as good as NYPD Pizza - but have to say, this was really good today - and the prices are better than NYPD - also, our food was out very quickly, and was HOT, which is a really nice touch compared to what you usually get!  We will definitely be going back, maybe to try the Party Pizza Challenge!

While I love seafood, I'm afraid I have to agree with the previous poster - had a horrible experience here with one of the Crab Pot dishes - one thing about seafood such as crab, mussels, etc., is that it needs to be very well cooked, or one is asking for trouble!  My dish was not, and as a result, I found plenty of trouble!  It's too bad, because we had gone here in September of 2010, and it was much better.  Things seem to have really gone downhill since then.

Disappointed - I had read all the great reviews, and was excited to check it out.  We've walked by there many times on our way to Teakwoods next door, and it always looked like it was crowded, and good times were rolling.  I had read that as you come inside, they throw you a hot towel for your face (kids were looking forward to this too!) but the only thing that hit me was the cold slap of reality - it just wasn't very good.  My second star was for service - they were friendly.  But the meal was not that great - the sushi was very plain, and little too close to room temperature for my taste.  I'm always hoping to find that awesome out of the way place that'll keep me out of the chains like Ra, etc., but this wasn't it.
