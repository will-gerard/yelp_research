Had a really great blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese!  Saw the reviews and was a little nervous but mine was perfect!

Been here a few times and really enjoy it.  Went to Valerie a few times so far.  I love that she puts a hot towel on your back and after that part of the massage and rubs you a little with the towel.  This helps to not feel greasy when your done and getting dressed.  Also like that she covers your eyes with an eye mask when you are on your back.  That way if you open your eyes,  there's no awkward eye contact. A final hot towel was also wrapped around my neck to finish the massage.  The lotion scent was nice, slightly minty but not overwhelming.  The room was quiet and peaceful and you couldn't hear others in the building,  even though it seems like a small space.  Prices are great,  especially with a membership,  and appointments are pretty easy to get.

I used the taco cart for catering a birthday party for 50 people. They arrived on time,  set up quickly, and were all super friendly. The food was amazing!  I got chicken,  carne casada, and carnitas. Everyone at the party raved about the food and many have already asked for the contact info to use themselves.  I plan on visiting the restaurant for lunch as well. The service is easy & convenient since they bring everything they need,  including plates,  utensils,  and napkins, then clean everything up before they go.  You also get to keep whatever is left over. I researched several companies before choosing Taqueria Guadalajara and picked them from all their positive reviews. I'm so glad I chose them!

I went here with my family after going to the Carefree Christmas craft fair and before the parade. It was a very busy night and seemed that no one that worked there could handle the rush. At one point while waiting for a few of our guests to arrive,  a waitress (not ours) came and took the appetizer plates that were in the empty seats and gave them to another table, without asking or saying anything to us. Not only was this rude but completely unsanitary to take something of one person table and give it to another without cleaning it! I ordered the chicken ceaser wrap and asked for no dressing but was told on special event nights there are no changes at all to the menu. Really? It doesn't seem difficult to not put dressing on my wrap. In the end,  the waitress told the kitchen it was due to a food allergy so they accommodated me, which was nice. The chicken was horrible and tasted like it was coated in salt. Overall it took 2 hours for 6 of us to eat because things were so slow. I won't be going back.

Ordered a Groupon and scheduling the appointment was convenient and easy. I contacted the company the day before Thanksgiving and was asked to text them my info and they would get back to me right after the holiday, which they did! Robert called 45 min in advance the day of to confirm the appointment and arrived promptly. Robert was extremely professional and really appeared to love his job. He was even able to get out rawhide stains left over by my dog that I thought had destroyed my carpet.  I would definitely use Sweettouch again and would request Robert. Thank you!!!

Love,  love,  love these watches!  No matter what my outfit for the day is... Or even my mood for the day is... There is a color to match! Super easy to mix and match and with so many color options you can never get bored.  Every time I wear my watch,  I always get compliments.

Love this place!  After a long Friday at work,  the service from Jill the bar can't be beat! Her energy and personality are so much fun. The food and drinks are great here but Jill is really the reason I keep coming back.

More than a year since my last review and I still love the Haymaker and The bartender Jill.  After a long day at work it's great to get happy hour here.  Even with the new places opening near by,  Jill (and the great food)  will keep me coming back!!!

Super disappointed.  Pizza was bland and tasteless.  Beer labeled as shock top was not that.  Worker was rude and pretty short with customers.

Went for the first time on 4.16.16 to see Ian Bagg. What a hilarious show and wonderful establishment. My group arrived about 30 min early and were seated promptly and had a fantastic waiter.  The room was small enough that there was no bad seat but big enough to have a great crowd. Even though the crowd kept the wait staff in their toes, they were attentive yet not distracting to the show. Had a party of 4 and all ordered different drinks and food items and no one was disappointed. Great flat breads and burgers. Ian Bagg had us laughing the whole time and made for a fantastic evening. This was a great way to celebrate my birthday and I will definitely be back to the House of Comedy!!!!

Such a great place and with a bartender like Jill, you are sure to have a great experience and night out! I've never been disappointed with any of the dinner food I've ordered. Breakfast is also amazing with lots of options and top it off with a mimosa for a great start to your day! I will definitely be a return customer.

Omg what a great place!  Went in and Alan was extremely helpful and so patient.  They have 89 flavors and I tried almost all of them! Great selection of products too.  Love that there is a new place close to home.  Prices are great too so I can keep making changes without worrying about breaking the bank.  I will be back!

What a fun way to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Attempted the apartment and had lots of fun but didn't make it out...bummer! Super impressed with the creativity of finding all the keys and codes.  This would be great for a team building work party or just a great night out with friends.
