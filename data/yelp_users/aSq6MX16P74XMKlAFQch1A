I saw all the positive yelp reviews for Phoenix appliance and decided to give them a try. I needed my dryer repaired and they were able to come out the same day. Vladimir was incredibly friendly and fixed my dryer gave me advice on how to maintain it going forward. If I ever have any issues with any of my other appliances I will definitely be giving him a call again!

So I wanted to leave a good review, I really did.  I would honestly give it negative stars if I could. I frequent the Zipps on Greenway and have always had impeccable service and great food. This Zipps totally fell short. We waited nearly an hour for our food and when it arrived, it was burned. When I mentioned it to the manager (Matt), he literally laughed in my face. Another manager came over and rectified it after Matt had his outburst. I love Zipps, it's beer, great food and environment. But this Zipps has the WORST management I've ever beheld.
