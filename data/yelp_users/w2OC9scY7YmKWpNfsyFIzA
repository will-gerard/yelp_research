Great museum, exhibits change every few months.  Free on First Friday evenings and Wednesday afternoons.  The bar/restaurant is delicious, and it's nice to have a drink and a bit in the sculpture garden.  Wonderful place to volunteer at.  Drop in and spend the afternoon, you won't be disappointed.

Top quality sushi restaurant!  It was easy to slip in for an early dinner on Friday evening, we were seated quickly at the sushi bar.  Excellent service from everyone and delicious food.  I will certainly be going back, often!

Andy gives a really good shine, complete with a saddle-soap washing of the shoe before he goes to work.  Also had a heel replaced, shoes are sent off-site for repairs, I wish I knew exactly where, but the heal replacement was done well and was reasonably priced.  The location can be hard to find if you aren't paying attention.

Solid burger joint.  This place does so many things right, and only one thing is lacking.   What they do right: Excellent customer service -- it's clear that they aim to please; always polite and professional.  They usually jump at the opportunity to clear your tray/trash for you. The employees seem happy and the managers appear to run the place well.   Good menu -- straightforward menu options, good pricing.  Fast service -- only a few minute wait for your food Efficient -- the pager/buzzer device almost seems too much for a burger place, but when you think about it, it helps save the annoyance of constantly hearing orders called out, or having to listen attentively for your own number.   Great food -- the burger is good, the fries are good, the onion rings are good.  The quality of ingredients seems really good, and they make tasty food.   What could be better: Juiciness -- the burger patty is a bit dry, seems to be cooked just a hair under medium.  Maybe there is some way to make it more juicy?  I should try requesting a medium rare burger.  If not for the somewhat dry meat patty, this place would be a full 5 stars.    Great place, I'll be back.

Great sandwiches, excellent service.  Delicious pickles.  Reminds me of Toaster Oven in San Francisco.  I normally get the wreck.  Get there before 11:30 to beat the lunch rush!

I should have read the reviews before I ordered.  Instead, I read some reviews while I was waiting for 20 minutes for my order to be finished.  Longest food truck service time ever.  These guys have a really clever name, their culinary cleverness stops there -- they are a two man crew when their operation and location truly warrants 3 or 4 to get the job done (Food Truck Thursday at the Hayden Ferry Lakeside campus in Tempe).    During my 20 minute wait I read some reviews explaining the blandness of the food.  I didn't really notice until I had nearly finished my meal, but it was indeed very bland.  It didn't really taste like anything. Except the chicken.  It tasted dried out and overcooked -- I am not sure how they managed to do that.  If they had pre-cooked the chicken would my order of chicken and vegetable stir fry taken 20 minutes?  If they cooked it fresh, why was it bland, dry, and overcooked?    I'll pass next time.

Excellent lunch spot.  I found this place randomly while looking for something new and different for a downtown lunch.  This place is great to go for a quick sushi or bento lunch.  The service is quick and attentive.  I usually get the bento lunch special, which is a great value and very well apportioned... one could probably make two meals of it with a to-go-box.    It's a bit off the beaten path from the main drag, but it offers one of the best lunch values of downtown.  They don't have a prime location or over the top decor, which allows them to give the lunchgoer a good value. The taste is excellent and the food is fresh and well prepared.  They are staffed well so there is hardly a wait even if it is busy.  I've noticed they play 90s music sometimes, which gives the place a quaint ambiance.  This has become one of my go-to spots downtown.

I came in for an emergency medical appointment after accidentally lubricating my contact lens with hydrogen peroxide cleaning solution (I wish I could leave a review for whoever designed the bottle for the lense solution!).   It happened on a Sunday, and I called as soon as they were open and explained the situation. They were able to squeeze me in between appointments and I was seen by the doctor within an hour of calling them initially; I only waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes or less.   The entire staff was very sympathetic and helpful for my situation.  I don't recall the name of the doctor but he was young and very relaxed which helped calm me down.  The visit was out of an abundance of caution and I received a good assessment of the issue and peace of mind. The recommended treatment was effective and I am a happy customer.  I was happy that they had hours on a Sunday of all days, and grateful that they could see me so quickly. The copay was reasonable and the service was excellent. 5 stars for a job well done!

It's new, it's fresh, it's a good value, and the service is great.  What is not to love about this new Cityscape lunch spot?  One evening last week I saw that this place had just opened- seemingly out of nowhere.  The next day some coworkers and I went here and were impressed.    It's all very straightforward, you can build your own for a certain (very reasonable) price and get unlimited toppings, or you can choose from one of their pre-made pizzas.  Several others made their own 'masterpieces', but I wanted to only get my feet wet so I had the Starving Artist Marghareta.  Mine came out really good (have posted a picture of it), but I wish I had just built my own and loaded on the toppings.  One of my colleagues said he felt guilty by the amount of meats he loaded his pizza with.  Another boldly claimed that this was his new favorite lunch spot.  We took a menu and shared it with some others in the office, and I expect that we will return often.    We showed up at 11:00 and there was a healthy but fast moving line, so one might go early to avoid a longer line.    The price is right, the service is great, and I don't see how you can go wrong.
