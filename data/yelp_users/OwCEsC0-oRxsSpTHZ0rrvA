Liberty Market is my favorite place to go for good coffee, good food, good people.  The staff makes that place what it is.  They are friendly, efficient, and just genuinely good people.  The espresso bar is by far my most favorite part of this establishment.  You always meet a new person at that bar while enjoying a nice cup of coffee.  I typically work on my laptop while there and chat with the baristas and other patrons.  The food is beyond delicious.  Most entres are very filling and do yourself a favor and try the red velvet cake.  They always have something new from the baker worth trying.  The owners are all great people who will do anything for their customers.  Like previous posts, do yourself a favor and check out the bathrooms, I prefer the chef's.  See you at the E-61 Bar.

A quaint place located in the heritage district in Gilbert.  If you are lucky, you can get right in and get a table.  The staff is very pleasant and the food is actually really good.  I always get a scramble and a cup of coffee.  A scramble is basically an omelet that was smarter then the cook and kind of exploded everywhere.  Customize one to your liking and you will be happy.  The restaurant can be very crowded sometimes... but can't blame them... you Arizonans are slow eaters.  Remember, always eat locally.

First time I have ever been here.  This is a dive bar.  And let me tell you, I sure love dive bars.  Their wings are delicious.  Some of the best wings I have ever had in Arizona.    We went on a Sunday on a Groupon deal so we splurged for wings and 2 burgers plus beer.  The pints were well priced but they didn't have a large selection though.  The burgers we had were delicious.  I had the "Hot Burger."  It was the special for the day and was only $7 and change for a huge burger and a large helping of steak fries.  The wings we had were the sweet chili.  Yum.  The service was real good.  They were very attentive and speedy.  The atmosphere was nice and I was more than comfortable at the bar for my first time there.  TVs everywhere and what was cool was that there were TVs in each booth!  Pretty sweet.  Would definitely return to bar for some good bar food and some brewskis.

Went to this restaurant on a groupon deal.  It was well worth it for the value!  Two entrees, a bottle of wine, 2 desserts for a reasonable price.  The veal marsala was bomb.  A good portion which I ate ridiculously fast because it was delicious.  The service was good and speedy.  The restaurant was about half full most of the time we were there.  If we didn't have the groupon deal our bill might have totaled upwards of $130.00 or more, so it can be a bit pricy, but overall I think it's worth it.

My all-time favorite bar in Gilbert.  Friendly dive bar atmosphere and get this... It's not sticky.  All the bartenders are extremely nice and the owner is usually working.  After my first time there, they were already makingnan effort to remember my name.  The have trivia games available.  Everyone is friendly and there are always some kind of shot/drink special.  The drink selection is beyond impressive for beer.  They have over a dozen different beers on tap.  The bar is extremely long and there is always room for you and your group.  Hightop seating as well as booths and regular tables are also available however I rarely use them sincei prefer the bar seating.  There is 4 pool tables which are usually available, except of Fridays which is tournament night.  Karaoke is on Saturday but unfortunately everyone sucks.    You really can't go wrong with this bar.  Just remember this is a dive and not Mill Ave or Scottsdale.  Had my birthday party here this year, too bad I don't remember it.

This is Italian food at its best.  The owner is a wonderful man with a big heart.  He puts his passion for life into his food.  Him, his wife, and son can be seen working their butts off every day to make sure your experience at their restaurant is the best.  Best Italian I have had in AZ... except for my mom's.

This business is definitely worth checking out for sure.  First thing that stood out to me is the extremely friendly, attentive, and outgoing staff.  The entire atmosphere from the beautiful murals on the wall to the smiles of the servers faces are only overshadowed by the delicious food and even more delicious prices.  Holy moly do you get a lot of food for your buck.  I'm not even going to discuss the individual foods we have ordered, have gone a couple times now.  Do yourself a favor and order the hommus.  Ridiculous amounts of hommus and extremely fresh delicious pita.  All food tastes fresh and comes out smoking hot.  Never ran out of my drink and every question, every need was addressed promptly and professionally.  Will be a lifelong customer.  Thanks guys.

Headed over for a friends birthday party.  There were 9 of us at the table.  We were seated quickly because we had a reservation and asked if we would like drinks almost immediately.  That is where the good service ended that evening.  My friend, the birthday girl, ordered an overpriced flavored soda and received the wrong one.  Simple mistake right?  Well she asks another server if she could get the drink she ordered and was told they were out of it.  Happy the server thinks its ok to substitute orders without asking, that's taking initiative there!  We ordered appetizers, they were good.  The hot wings were really freaking hot and even before we tried them we asked for a little extra ranch.  "Of course, I'll bring it right out now."  5 minutes pass... 10 minutes... 15.... we ended up asking the busboy and he brought it out right away.  Kudos to him.   We are still waiting for that ranch from the server 12 hours later.  Entrees arrived.  All delicious, delivered hot, ours lacked a pizza scoop but no biggy.  After everyone finished 7/8 of their pizza the servers decides then to ask if we need cheese or pepper flakes.  Tad late for that thank you.  "Ready for the check?"  How about no... we would like to order dessert, and thanks for asking.   Dessert came out.  Delicious food.  Cookie/ice cream, brownie/ice cream and cobbler all delicious.  But even more delicious than the raspberry chocolate sauce drizzled over our desserts... the icing on the cake!  Icing on the cake was the automatic 18 percent gratuity added to each of our bills.  Now it makes sense!  The ridiculously lousy service we received by our space cadet service could be attributed to the fact no matter how terrible he was as a server, he would still get a better than average tip from our table.  I really hope my first and probably last visit to Picazzo's is not the same for other patrons.  Don't get me wrong the food was delicious, however pricey.  Their saving grace would have been good service and I didn't get that.

After a promising response after my previous yelp review, I was pleased to see them reaching out to reconcile the poor service I received at the restaurant.  After 2 months, I have not received the alleged giftcard.  Would have been nice to use that giftcard to give them a second shot, but I guess not.

I still remember the first time I went to Joe's Farm Grill.  It was a mild May evening and we decided to eat outside. The idea of farm fresh foods really appealed to me.  I am always beyond satisfied with my meal.  I don't think there has been a time that I have been there that I didn't order a barbecue chicken pizza.  I am not a fan of most novelty pizzas, but this one is just amazing.  I'm pretty sure the bbq sauce they use, is the same one they use at Joe's Real BBQ.  The enormous tree behind the Farm Grill is sick and we always crack jokes about the sign about falling and scorpions.  The line can be a little long, but they are quick at the order window and it is definitely worth the wait.  Don't forget to try them for breakfast as well, mmm breakfast tacos...  Do yourself a favor and walk off that delicious meal through the farm and sneak a grape (when they are in season) that grow on the arbors and fences.  Enjoy and remember to eat local

Been going to the BBD for a while now.  Favorite thing is their cheap prices.    Breakfast food is real good here too.  I have never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table.  Normally there is no wait whatsoever.  The Griz is amazing and it like 50lbs of meat and egg for your morning pleasure.    Fridays are the Fish Fry and apparently its like $8.99 for unlimited fish!  You get some fries and hush puppies yum  Come on in and get a coffee.  Enjoy your dinner with a cold beer or a fluffy bear.  Whatever floats your boat.

My first visit to Sweet Republic and when I was done my first thought was, "why did I take so long to come here!?"  I sampled a few of their ice creams and let me tell you.  All delicious.  In particular the mint chip ice cream was delicious.  It tastes like fresh mint because get this... it is!  Service was quick and friendly.  We got in right before a rush and let me tell you, the staff were able to handle it like pros.  Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one.  You can tell how proud they are of their creations.  I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose, you will love.  Stop on down, took me 30 minutes to get there from Gilbert, and enjoy a cone or cup.  Do yourself a favor and don't delay for 3 years like I did!

This radio station is awesome.  Best rock/classic rock radio station in the valley.   All DJs are excellent.    Check out Sludge and the crew for their morning show Monday thru Friday.

Best pizza I have had in Arizona since moving here from New York in '07.  The personal touch the owners put into their work is refreshing.  The pizza is beyond delicious and always consistent.    The garlic knots are real good as noted in other reviews.  I have gone to this restaurant a couple dozen times and the pizza is also  better when you dine in.  Pizza is always better hot haha.  Do yourself a favor and order extra cheese-well done.

So I thought that good chinese food was not in Gilbert.  Finally have been proved wrong.  This place is delicious.  Always full and always delivers fresh food.    Kung pao chicken was spicy and tasty.  Lo mein is fresh and tasty.  Mongollian beef was a little lacking in spice but still good.    The soups were really good.  I had the luck of being able to sample the egg drop and the hot and sour.  Both real good.  The decor is typical Chinese food restaurant.  Kind of homey.  Prices are typical and justified.  Remember to eat your cookie not the fortune.

I love Gordon Biersch.  Biersch Biersch, Biersch, down into my belly.  I enjoy their beer.  I enjoy their food, and I enjoy their atmosphere.  I have been going to this Biersch location for about 2.5 years and I love it.  Awesome happy hour prices and amazing staff that is always helpful and fun.  People who complain about the prices need to utilize the happy hour prices which are available daily.  Even not on happy hour, their beers are only $4.  I've had more expensive beers elsewhere.

Pita Jungle... Pita jungle....  I don't know what it is... You're atmosphere is usually not my cup of tea.  Not normally a fan of my servers having dreadlocks and tattoos.  But you know what?  Keep bringing me that hummus and taboule and I'm transported to a world where I too have dreadlocks and tattoos!  Maybe even a few piercing.  And all of the sudden, I am an art critic too.  I'm in love with the food here at Pita Jungle.  Never a bad experience.  My biggest issue is when I forget what I ordered and what is what on the plate.  All I really care about or think about when eating here is, "does it taste good with a pita?" The answer is usually, "Hell yes it does!".   The art all around the restaurant is a nice touch.  Service is always quick and the food is always fresh.  Wish additional pitas were free but it's all good, I can spare the 34 cents.  Always happy with my experiences here.  Bring your hipster friend here before it's not ironic enough for them.

Amazing gym.  Extremely clean.  As stated in other reviews, the staff is extremely friendly.  I love the towel service.  All of the machines are in service and I have never had a problem with too many people in the gym working out at the same time.  I have not utilized the group fitness sessions but from what I can tell and what I have heard, it seems pretty solid.  They have TVs on the cardio equipment and needless to say, that's pretty awesome.  Come on... Ace Ventura was on one of the couple dozen channels and if that doesn't help pass the time on the cardio equipment, I don't know what will.  The juice bar is pretty sweet but be careful because it can add up quickly if you don't watch it $$$.

I will keep this short and sweet.  Service - Young guy. Really friendly. Solid 5  Coffee - Americano - really weak.  Maybe I should have asked for another shot... I think my large Americano only had 1 shot... Weird. 2 stars  Food - chicken Sammie - chicken was ok, little dry. Wasn't expecting a lot but the tomato was not ripe or fresh. Disapointing.  2 stars.  Atmosphere - music was way too loud.  Mostly college kids.  Everything was dirty.  The tables, the chairs ripped, the floor carpet was gross.  Tiny flys everywhere because it was dirty.  If I had to use 1 word it would be sticky.  Cobwebbs and dust everywhere.  1 star is being too kind.  Overall - would not go back due to the filth.  If you aren't going to clean it, hire someone to.

I did not stop laughing once during the show.  There we 3 comedians before the headliner and they were all hilarious.  The headlining comedian was so funny.  I wish I could repeat some of the jokes but they would surely violate some yelp policies on profanity haha.    We were seated in the main room before other guests because we agreed to order some dinner.  We just got some loaded fries and nachos.  Typical bar food and they were good.  Had a full bar but we didn't utilize it more than a couple rounds of draft beers.  The waitress was prompt and not pushy which I liked very much.  The host was friendly and made a few jokes himself.  Never felt uncomfortable or out of place like I do at other Scottsdale venues time to time.  Can't wait to go back and would recommend this venue to others.

Sunday morning rolls around.    We decided on finally using that Groupon for Family Cafe.  This dining experience is a perfect example of not being a cheap-ass and spending the couple extra dollars for actual edible food.  In hindsight, we should have just walked out of there the second we first arrived.  This place is a hole in the wall in Mesa behind a Taco Bell.  Don't judge  a book by its cover is an important saying to always remember.  In this case the book's cover matched in pages inside.  We entered the... I guess restaurant, and had to walk halfway into the dining area to be welcomed.  The hostess, who I assume was a family member of the owner looked frazzled and confused on what to do.  She ended up telling us to seat ourselves.  I assumed that this was a family member of the owners or someone that worked there because she couldn't have been older then 13 or 14 years old, if not younger.  Very unprofessional, but that's just me.    I don't know about the other diners who go to this establishment, but the air was musty and smelled of bathroom cleaner when we first entered the restaurant.  This foul odor lingered through our meal and time there.  After seated at the table, we waited for at least 7 to 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by our server.  My coffee and water made it to the table promptly, hey nice job!  GF:  "Does your water taste funny?"  Oh it sure did.  I look around and I noticed everyone else had straws...  Why am I already pissed and I haven't even placed my order yet!  The menu looked somewhat promising.  A nice selection of comfort food and things that appealed to me.  Phew, this Yelp review may be saved after all!  I asked the server about the "Southwest Omelet" and ended up settling on that.  Food ordered... Delivered...  ...   ...   ...  ok something isn't right.  Omelet right?  Like egg surrounding omelet stuff?  That's not whats on my plate though.  After 10 minutes or so of not seeing my server, I waived down another server and asked them what food was on my plate.  What was the name of the dish?  His answer, Chorizo Scramble.  Yeah, that's not what I ordered.   He did offer to take it back but, hey it was a third choice for me.    The texture was that of blended scrambled eggs mixed with ground beef.  The color of the dish was a lovely brownish green.  The home fries, or as I will call them, undercooked potato slices, were cold and tasteless.  I deemed my dish inedible and ate my toast.  Thank you for striking this monstrosity from my tab and no I didn't mind paying for the tax... hahahaha.  The server made a comment about how she was sorry that I didn't like my meal and that I will probably go to Taco Bell next door.  I wonder if that happens a lot.  I do feel pretty bad to leave such a negative review, but I didn't find much positive to review about.  Not worth the drive and expenditure on gas.

Uncle Bear's is a nice little neighborhood bar to go eat and drink.    The bar food is well bar food.  So don't go there expecting gourmet foods and drinks.  The price for non happy hour food and drink is a little steep but is well worth it.  Come on, how can you enjoy one their beers on tap including 4 Four Peaks selections without diving into a mouthwatering plate of cheese fries or coconut shrimp.   The building is adorned with pictures of dogs.  And there are peanuts in dog dishes.  So great!  All this place needs are dogs playing poker and then we got a winner.  Our waitress was pretty awesome, extremely sweet, and mostly readily available.  Saved me some $ suggesting a pitcher of beer over a just ordering pints once my friend arrived.  Kudos to her!  Trivia is playing and surprisingly people were participating.  So of course my table did too.    The overall atmosphere is laid back, low pressure, friendly, and feels like a neighborhood bar.  Definitely recommend

What can I say about Yoli's cafe...  ooh that rhymed!  Enough rhyming.  Would never have found this place if not for yelp and my normal Saturday ritual of typing breakfast/brunch into the search option to see where the internet is going to send me to fill me up with breakfast goodies.  When I saw a place in Downtown Chandler that was both reviewed as delicious and inexpensive, that's when my search that day ended.  Popped that address into GoogleMaps on my phone and away we go.  "In a quarter mile make a left turn," says my phone in that lovely monotone robot voice reminiscent of a test proctor in grade school.  Are you sure Google Lady?  That looks like houses...  "Make a left turn!"  Ok ok ok, I believe you.  Don't have to yell at me.  Oh dear, where are you taking me phone?  Another quick right turn and we are clearly in a neighborhood and right as I about to turn around... "Your destination is on the right."  Oh wait!  It is!  Walking through the doors, I wasn't too sure if I was walking into a restaurant or someone's house.  That's ok though because it smelt heavenly and based on the amount of people in their, this was a restaurant or the home of a really hospitable homeowner who liked to cook.  We were promptly offered a place to sit and given menus.  Phew, it is Yoli's.  I ordered a cup of coffee and an egg skillet.  And dear lord in heaven above, I swear i heard angels singing when it was being carried to my table.  Too dramatic?  I may have let out an audible, "Oh Yeah!" similar to that of the Kool-Aid guy though.  Eggs we're cooked to perfection and and coffee kept flowing.  The waitress was very kind and prompt with everything.  It is a definite family feel here at Yoli's.  Did I mention my bill was less than $15 for breakfast for both me and my girlfriend!  Give them a try down at Yoli's!  Trust me, you'll love it.

This review is for my most recent visit to Tryst.  Normally, I would probably leave a 4 to 5 star review (and maybe i will reevaluate and update this review on our next visit)  The point of this review is not to highlight their food.  Honestly, their food is top notch for the most part.  Never any complaints here.  My review is to highlight an over served regular customer who made every other customer uncomfortable who walked into this establishment.  I understand that servers cannot control the behavior of their patrons, but to allow a customer to be beligerantly rude and disrupt others is not good business.  Some servers seemed to play his little game and egg him on.  Other servers seemed agitated with his antics but didn't do anything to handle the situation (and honestly I do not expect them to, I expect a manager to.)  A huge part of how I choose where to dine is due to the ambiance of the place.  If I feel uncomfortable, chances are I will not be going back.  If my girlfriend is uncomfortable, chances are we are never going back.  If this man wasn't there and/or was dealt with in a proper fashion, this would have been a lovely dining experience at a restaurant I have been to many times.

Been here a few times.  The subs are all delicious.  The service is fast and friendly.  You can call ahead and pick up or order in store.    The restaurant is clean and the seating area is nice with a couple TVs in it.  Definitely a good place for lunch.

I was really excited to go to this restaurant due to all the hubbub about the other locations.  So many people seemed so happy about this new location opening here in Chandler.  I work in the area so I thought, "what the hell, why not!"   I called ahead and put my name down for a reservation.  Haha, probably didn't need to do so.  It was empty when we arrived at 5:30.  Though early, still disheartening to see an empty restaurant.  We showed up 15 minutes early and got seated right away, sweet.  Our waiter was right there when we got seated and had water in tow.  Already a plus.  First thing I asked was his recommendation.  He had 4 or 5 recommendations for 2 or 3 different scenarios (light meals, heavy meals, chicken/beef etc."    Salsa and chips were "eh had better"  The green salsa was yummy and different because it was sweet, but the red salsa was your average run of the mill tomato salsa.  I ordered the "Nuevo Chile Relleno," and it was phenomenal.  Prepared beautifully, extremely tasty, and an average sized portion which was plenty large enough.  ($14)  My girlfriend had the beef "Flying Saucer." ($8) It was served on top of a crispy, muy delicioso fried tortilla thing and was stacked as tall as it was wide with yummy goodness.  The beef was shredded and seasoned to perfection.    Ok the most depressing part of this meal... you knew it was coming... the Spanish rice.  It was surprising when it came out to my table because I had no clue it came with my food.  Totally failed reading comprehension apparently.  It was bland and tasteless.  Much much colder than the rest of our meal and honestly if they left it out, my meal would probably have been better.  whoops.  All together a great experience.  And I will return to try more on the menu.

Not my favorite gelato place by far.  The gelato was icy and was more like the consistency for ice cream of frozen yogurt.  Felt rushed by the person at the counter.  Not really any reason to go back but not terrible.

Best sushi experience I have had in the valley.    The sushi was real good and constructed well.  The prices were very reasonable.    The service was very kind and accomidating.  I would choose this establishment over any other sushi bar in the valley.  The dinner and lunch specials are awesome.  A bento box with your choice of 2, 3, or 4 entrees and miso soup.

mmm, this is chain mexican food that I will eat when I am sober...  That is saying enough if you ask me!  ok ok ok, Senor Taco is muy delicioso.  It is real similar to say a Filiberto's but super clean and efficient.  Similar salsa bar setup with the weird jalapeno and carrot mixture that when you ask what it is called they tell you, "Jalapenos and Carrots?"  Carne Asada is the bomb and I enjoy their California burrito.  Think all the unhealthy things you can put in a burrito... Sour cream, guacamole, potatoes, beans... yum.    Biggest downfall is the measly six chips they give you with your meal.  I am sure you could probably get some more if you wanted them though since they are always super nice.  The salsa are aight.  Oh an the 10% student discount they give me when I wear my nerdy name badge... ohhh yeah.  Go there and enjoy some chain mexican food.  You know you want to!
