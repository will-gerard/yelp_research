Welcome Diner in its latest incarnation is a gem. Their new hours make them far more accessible for dinner service, but you'll still want to plan on showing up relatively late, at least during the summer, as most of their seating is outside.  The food here is the star, but the workers and cooks are all having a great time, really genuine and fun, and overall make the experience even better.   The Port of Call burger is exactly what you want: perfectly cooked, coated in cheese and onions and whatever else, and the type of meal that will leave you just barely too full.  The fried chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, if you can unhinge your jaw to take it on. Get it with melted cheese, and go even further by tacking on gravy and bacon, if you think your heart can handle it.  The fries are fantastic as well. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of ingredients loads the food with flavor and makes it well worth it. They also have some amazing specials, and: their biscuits. Their biscuits are a thing of beauty, either with honey on them, or as part of the chicken sandwiches; they're simply perfect.  They're just a hop-skip off the 7th St. I-10 exit, and well worth trying out.

Coronado Cafe is a fun little restaurant off of 7th, just north of the 10, tucked away across the street from a Cocos of all things. Do yourself a favor and duck into Coronado instead.  They have some fantastic appetizers, including this great brie & lavash dish and some fantastic salads with great dressing.  I've had their half-pound angus burger a few times and it's delicious. It's an $11 burger for lunch, and they offer a $14 version of it with some better ingredients for dinner, but it is perfectly cooked and dripping with flavor.   And then there's the Cookie. The Cookie need be described with a capital C because of its potential to destroy worlds and move mountains. The Cookie is a mound of dough, cooked through with just a bit of softness to the very center, drizzled in chocolate and absolutely amazing. Even though I had been here TWICE before, I completely forgot how substantial each Cookie was, and encouraged the two ladies I was with to join me in ordering a Cookie. One for each of us.  This was a mistake of the best form, as the three of us barely dented one, and we ended up bringing them home. They're fantastic and gooey and crazy and totally well-priced. (Under $5, if memory serves.)  Coronado is pretty tiny, so you're going to want to make sure you call ahead. They have a cute little patio that does its best to shield you from 7th, but it's too damn hot out even with the misters to do anything but inside.  The location is a bit odd to me, but the food is good and whenever I'm in the neighborhood, I'm happy to duck in. The service was friendly and our waitress was accommodating and took care of things in short order for us. Overall, a fun time every time I've been.

Honey Bears is a place I'd heard fantastic things about for quite some time and so when I finally made it over there one weeknight with some friends and office-mates, I was surprised to find it so incredibly lackluster.   More than that, it was simply not good. I'm not sure if the food was just old and done for the day, as we were there about an hour before closing time, or what, but the meat was basically sprayed with some sauce and they called it a day. The meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked. I had chicken but the ribs were absolutely nothing to sneeze at either. The corn on the cob was simply some frozen piece nuked up or boiled or what-have-you, with some chips thrown in for good measure and that was about it.  The insides aren't impressive in the slightest, either. I've been to plenty of dive places and had a great dining experience and considered it more the fun for it (Lolo's original location in Phoenix comes to mind, as it has a certain fun and well-managed charm inside) but this was dark, dingy, and unpleasant.  The sauce was perhaps a saving grace if the food wasn't served nearly lukewarm and was able to bring something to the table on its own. Sadly, no amount of sauce-drowning could save my meal. I left unhappy and unfulfilled. I've heard so many great things from people I trust, so I may have to try it once more, during the day, but for now, the one star stands, as there was simply nothing even a little redeeming about this food.

Romano's tries hard, and I give them credit for that. This wasn't a horrible dining experience. Probably closer to a 2.5 star. But it certainly wasn't fantastic. I ordered the carbonara and despite it being "hand made" and fresh and including an egg on it, it just didn't hit on all cylinders for me. It was rather light on flavor. Part of that is my fault for ordering carbonara: a dish I'm always more disappointed in than I remember.  Service was decent, though our waitress wasn't aware that they apparently served Orangina. "I think they're just decorative." Me: "They're in 24-packs stacked up in between those huge tables there. I think they're for sale." (They were.)  Overall, you get what you expect here, and I wasn't expecting much. Mission accomplished, though my mother enjoys some salad thing they do, and again, it wasn't *awful*. It just wasn't great.

Aloha Kitchen is damn good Hawaiian. After mourning the loss of my favorite Hawaiian haunt in Tempe, my wife suggested we try Aloha Kitchen. They've been there forever, but I hadn't ever made it over.  They're fantastic. Great teriyaki chicken: perfect tender and fresh and a great sauce, great macaroni/potato salad (the combo is nicely balanced, and no celery or relish, which are dealbreakers for me). They also whip up some mean bulkogi and have a great kalbi special pretty often.   Overall, they're exceptionally tasty, well-priced, and even the mini plates are more than enough food for me, and I can put away a lot of food.

Quite fantastic food with decent service. Had the traditional with bacon, eggs (a bit closer to over hard while I had ordered over medium) and amazing potatoes, great toast, and a great biscuit.  The girlfriend ordered the crab eggs benedict, one of their specials, which was fantastic, except that she found a few pieces of shell, which is a jarring and unpleasant experience in ANY crab dish.   We finished off with the blackberry cinnamon bread pudding and it nearly killed us with its deliciousness. I was dithering on whether or not we could finish an entire serving, and thus, if we should get it to go or not, and the waiter offered to bring out a sample with the rest to go, which was really perfect and totally appreciated.  Seriously, they say "award-winning" and they say it's great, but until you've tried this... you have not had dessert. It. Was. Incredible.   AJ's also has it on sale if you need a quick fix. Will be returning definitely. Very tasty.

Rino D's and I go way back, to right when they first opened. They've been our family's go-to pizza place for over a decade (though NYPD has really brought it with regards to pizza) and we still hit Rino D's about once a month or every other month.  This has to be said: Rino D's has categorically the best hot wings in the valley. (And frankly, likely the entire state.) They are HUGE, with their delicious sauce (which I believe is based on the Frank's Red Hot original style, true to real wing form), and most importantly, they're perfectly cooked.  So many wings (I'm looking at you, Vine) are previously-frozen, dingy little sticks of sadness, slathered in sauce after the fact. Only Rino D's makes them perfectly, cooked in the sauce and then fried up properly. They're simply amazing, and they never freeze their chicken--it's their secret to success with the wings, and you honestly CAN. NOT. find better out here.  The pizza is a slightly more meddling affair. I'd recommend that you ask for it with thick crust (available on sizes up to large), and try their garlic butter crust flavoring. The pizza is damn decent, fresh, and well cooked, and the staff is always really nice. It doesn't scream out and grab me like NYPD's amazing pies do, but they're also slightly different in style.  All-in-all Andy & company have done amazing things with this tiny space. The wings are serious showstoppers. Get 'em hot and they'll ruin you for all other wings. The pizza is damn good, the prices are right, and the staff is fast and friendly. Great neighborhood pizza joint.

Liberty Market is a wonderful restaurant run by absolutely great people. Kiersten and her husband (lead chef) Dave do their best to keep things running smoothly, but always have time to chat with you and genuinely listen to you. They're very passionate about delivering a great experience, and it shows, as Kiersten is there at all hours, on nearly every shift.  Joe Johnston, the other partner (of Joe's Real BBQ fame) is tremendously friendly as well and usually behind the coffee bar, engaging customers and trying new things.  Now to the food:  Everything is quite fantastic. The grilled cheese was long my favorite, as simple as it sounds, with a bit of mayo and several cheese and a nice tomato, grilled perfectly and served with one of their great side salads--I always go with the caprese pasta salad.  The burger is delicious. The rancher sandwich has a piece of filet with carmelized onion and arugula and is just amazing.  Breakfast is great too. Really, there's nothing bad I can say about the food--my only feedback is that I'd love to see everything about a buck cheaper.  Their minestrone soup is incredible, for someone who doesn't even like minestrone, and their meatballs are great as well.  If you're there and enjoying yourself, take a trip to the bathrooms. On the way, you'll see the kitchen, through large plate glass windows, and each of the four bathrooms are designed by one of the partners for their own unique flair. Definitely a fun touch to a great dining experience.   It's a bit of a drive if you're not on this side of the Valley, but it's really great food and a great price served by great people, all around.

Great place, delicious breakfast, relatively cheap. Sad that they don't use real maple syrup, but their cinnamon buns are amazing and their scrambles are top-notch.

Fantastic lunch, great prices, nice people, and possibly the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.   Things get busy, but they still manage to get stuff out to us pretty quickly. We always get it to go, so I haven't had to deal with any rudeness.  I liked their soups and their croissants are great. Overall, a good place to eat.

My favorite hot dog of all time is the Ripper from Rutt's Hut in Clifton, New Jersey. Something about deep-frying a hot dog until it splits open, bursting forth with flavor and cholesterol, really does it for me.  In lieu of that, Ted's is a good quality hot dog place with unique, charbroiled-tasting hot dogs. They hail from Buffalo, New York and the line often wraps around the front area near the grill, where you shout out your order to the current grillmaster, similar to Chuckbox when it's busy.  The highlight is almost certainly their incredibly onion rings. They serve huge portions for decent prices and everything is always fresh and tasty. (Spent $8.15 for a large iced tea, all-beef hot dog, and onion rings.) The onion rings are more of a torn apart onion blossom than the traditional rings--an approach I much prefer. There are plenty of sides and toppings you can request as well, from cheese to chili to onions, 'kraut, ketchup, mustard, and all the other basics.  Overall a pleasant experience and a unique flavor. Worthwhile if you're looking for a damn good hot dog. (And they take credit cards now, after many years of holding out as cash only!)

Mining Camp is something of an Arizona institution, as they're currently celebrating their 50th anniversary. The first thing to know about Mining Camp is that they're far. From everything.  Situated at the foothills of the Superstition Mountains, you'll be driving further east than you've ever cared to when not making a trip to Superior. It's several miles off of Idaho Rd, one of the last exits on the US 60 before it splits up and heads into the hills.   Mining Camp's traditional restaurant room is meant for family style dining. For $21.95 ($14 through 7/4/10 if you pay with cash!), you get an unlimited amount of rolls, chicken with stuffing and gravy, ham with pineapple orange glaze, green beans, baked beans, coleslaw, and ribs. Amazing beef ribs, the equal of which I have never tasted.  The ribs are well-sauced; not a dry rub or anything like that. They're cooked until the meat simply falls off the bone, the sauce is a homemade BBQ sauce with a bit of a citrus kick, and they are probably the best cooked ribs I've ever had.   Their chicken is also not to be overlooked. They make their own homemade stuffing out of their raisin bread and top their chicken with a delightful homemade gravy as well.  The servers are nice and accommodating and more than willing to bring you exactly what you want, in any quantity. You are NOT able to bring anything home once you order seconds though, so keep that in mind.  Our family does Mining Camp every Christmas Day. We have for the last 15 years now, and we intend to keep doing it as it's a lovely place to eat a nice holiday-style meal without having to deal with it at home. Truly fantastic, and we're thrilled their open every year.  They've opened their other room as a separate, regular restaurant, but I haven't had the chance to try it. I don't really think I will, either, since if I'm making the trip out there, I'm going to gorge myself on ribs.

Cowboy Ciao was one of my favorite Arizona Restaurant Week places to date. They put out a solid menu with some fantastic options and they know that Restaurant Week should be at least a little bit of a deal. (I hate restaurants that just toss three items on their menu that would've added up to $29 anyway.)  I had the fried mac & cheese which was delicious, topped off with a fantastic tomato-chile-salsa type thing. My only complaint here is that it was just this side of not-warm-enough. (The Mac, not the chile stuff, which isn't supposed to be hot.)   I also had a good several bites of the girlfriend's Stetson Chopped Salad. I understand the hype. It's at once fresh, crispy, and packed with flavor--it's more an experience than a salad. Absolutely perfect and beautiful to boot.  The scallops with beet risotto were just fantastic. The goat cheese was a masterstroke, the scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the dish was just the right size for a three course--three large-ish scallops. The risotto was tasty though it could've used just a little something to perk it up, but the goat cheese did some fantastic heavy lifting on that front. Absolutely awesome.  Finally, the banana cream pudding/pie and the bread pudding. Both hit  the spot, but the banana cream felt a little less special, if that makes sense. The bread pudding was fantastic, but definitely a heavy dish after such a meal.   Overall, a great experience, though they're a touch on the pricey side... regardless, we'll be back... those scallops were too delicious to ignore.

Pepin has been around forever and the novelty of the flamenco dancing isn't enough to eclipse the otherwise only-okay food, high prices, and sometimes dodgy service. (Not to mention they're randomly-being-closed).   The paella is really quite expensive, and unless they're dumping entire handfuls of saffron into each pan (they're not), it's pretty well over-priced. It's also essentially impossible to share, since it's a per-person charge, which is frustrating.  The crab and black rice croquettes were a pleasant surprise, I'll give them that, but service is typically slow, paella is typically only just decent, and overall, it's not really worth it beyond the initial novelty. (It's really dated inside, to boot.)  I prefer Tapas Papas Fritas up the road a bit, though they don't offer flamenco, but their food quality and service is generally much better.

This review references just the steakhouse. We really only had time for our meal here, so I'll leave the rest of Rawhide to others.  Rawhide produces a decent steak, most of the time. On this night, me and one of my friends both ordered a NY strip, medium rare, that essentially came out medium well-to-well.  Overcooking a steak is just something you don't do if you're a steakhouse. Devise a system. Time your steaks right. Do whatever you have to do not to screw that up. We were a bit pressed for time, so we didn't send them back, but they were tough, although had a bit of flavor to them.  My vote was 2 stars, but my cohorts without overcooked steaks enjoyed their meals alright. The sides are somewhat standard fare, nothing spectacular or amazing by any means, but they bake a potato as well as the next budget steakhouse.  On that note, the budget isn't terribly cheap. I think my steak was pushing $25, which is fine for a NY strip if you get it right.   The corn on the cob was disappointing (likely frozen and then warmed/briefly grilled?) and that's something you shouldn't try to cheap out on.  For dessert, we had a lovely pot o' stearno-powered table-made smore kit, which was fun, and a good $3.   Overall, unless you're making an old west evening of it, you can clearly get a much better steak for cheaper at some place like Texas Roadhouse.

Defalco's is good, delicious, Italian fun. I've been on their meatball subs, with everything homemade and loaded with cheese, for some time now. They've got my order just a bit off once or twice (bringing out an entire, large caprese instead of the small side salad) but everything is so delicious and fresh and the place is so fun, you won't care. Plus, caprese!  It's also a great source for hard-to-find Italian ingredients, like ladyfingers for my friend Lorenzo's famous tiramisu. They had just the right kind and for a decent price. Add delicious cannolis, fast service, and a huge menu, and you've got a recipe for awesome.

RA is slow, expensive, and only so-so on the actual sushi part of things. Rolls are not exactly loaded down, though most are of a decent size. The fish is fresh enough, but sometimes comes out a bit warmer than I'd like, and today, a very simple lunch order took over 1.5 hours. Not great when on lunch hour from work. I prefer Sakebombers down on McClintock and Broadway. It looks a little dumpy, but they pack the fish in, it's fresh and delicious, and priced right.

I'm not sure what it is about FatBurger that's caused it to fall out of my good graces so, but here we are at two lowly stars. Maybe it's because my first FB experience was at the Las Vegas Strip FatBurger, at three in the morning, surrounded by hookers, pimps, punters, johns, pushers, bookies, trannies, and all remaining manner of late-night underbelly. It added charm, whimsy, and terrifying people watching.  Since then, every time I've been progressively more disappointed. We've reached the nadir here, with burgers that lack any real flavor to me, unless I punch them up with the tasty cholesterol of a fried egg on them. I don't know what they're NOT doing, but when Smashburger just down the street is creating a burger of kings, jam-packed with SMASH flavor, I can't help but be disappointed at the lifeless patty of beef crying out for a savior of spice. Alas, none to be found, it forces its way down my gullet, falling into a heap of shame and indigestion.  The fries are, well, they're run-of-the-mill frozen steak fries.  I suppose for someone that bills themselves as the last great hamburger stand, I really wish they'd focus on, you know, making great hamburgers. For now, I'll swing down to Smashburger or, in a pinch, shame-eat at Five Guys.

Looking for a mediocre dining experience coupled with inattentive staff for which you can overpay? Look no further than Gordon Biersch!  "A less tasty, more expensive BJ's," as a I typically refer to it, Gordon Biersch is frustrating in its shockingly bland menu, served by staff who don't know how to keep a drink refilled (but frequently just hang around and chat amongst themselves) and quickly stop caring about you once the food is delivered.  I've had a number of bad experiences, from waiting nearly an hour and a half to get our (by then, lukewarm) food during their busy time, with nary a care from our waiter, to having the wait staff completely abandon us after delivering the check, despite it being a slow weeknight and the fact that we were clearly sticking around to talk business for awhile.   The menu is like an upgraded Applebees. The food is shocking in its blandness, like a hodgepodge of tex-mex, americana, and stunning mediocrity. Entrees will routinely run you between $16-$20 and won't be worth it, they won't cook a burger the way you ask, ("to a minimum of 155°") and things are just generally unpleasant.  People love the garlic fries, but it's just shitty frozen fries doused in what I imagine is canned garlic. I'm not expecting the world here; it's a chain micro-brewery, but these fries do NOT deserve the rave reviews they sometimes get.  The pasta dishes are more of the same: Sysco or thereabouts quality but just wholly lacking flavor and inspiration. Everything feels phoned in, and the entire place just rubs me the wrong way. I've had the misfortune of continuing to come back because it's close to my office and clients like it for some reason.   Generally, I'll avoid if at all possible. It really leaves a lot to be desired at prices that magnify their shortcomings.

Let me start by clarifying that my five stars are for lunch on Mill. Rula Bula is a bit of a sleeper lunch place: if you've gone at night when school's in, it is very clearly a "get crunked" frat boy crazy kind of bar. So it will come as a damn good shock to you when you go during the light of day and enjoy a nice, relaxing lunch.  The fish and chips here are delicious. Beer-battered, thick and hearty, and real fish, served with a great tartar sauce and their awesome "chips"--lightly fried, thick potato slices.  Their boxty is a whole different story, but it's packed with flavor and incredibly hearty. Their salads are huge and everything is made up fresh, and you can tell they take pride in cranking out a really great lunch and catching you off guard. They're like a better Robbie Fox's, but they were here long before, and it's not hard to see why they've done so well.  Their patio is fantastic, the help is on top of things, the food comes quick, and everything is absolutely delicious and beautifully homemade, not just frozen, Sysco, dropped in the fryer, like so many pubs and bars. It matters and the price is right and it's WELL worth it to try this place for a great lunch.  My only complaint is that a few of the authentic Irish tables inside are too low for my legs to fit underneath, so I do well to avoid them for lunch. Otherwise, I'm always happy here for lunch.

I've never used a travel agent since I hadn't really seen the purpose before and I've planned several large trips. Things have been busy at work lately, so I decided I would enlist the help of my Mill Avenue neighbor in Sue from Mill Avenue Travel for booking my honeymoon.  She was fantastic. I was always convinced that I could do "just as well" or perhaps even cheaper without a travel agent, but this trip dispelled me of that notion pretty completely. While Sue's prices were typically exactly what I was finding myself, she was able to assist us with upgrades to the hotel and airfare that I would've been helpless to manage otherwise.  The only thing we paid her directly for was to have her book our airfare, and that was only $35 per person. She managed the entire booking and was also able to find us a fantastic hotel in Buenos Aires in the perfect part of town--a boutique hotel, picking up on the fact that we aren't the typical five-star-touristy-hotel type.  Sue was genuinely excited for us and for our trip, and worked with the cruise line to ensure we got all of our on-board credit after I noticed we had some missing.   Overall, Sue made the trip planning process a great deal easier and it was well worth it to use her services. If you have a trip of any complexity at all, I'd highly recommend her. She's on top of things every step of the way and it simply feels like you have an ally in the travel arrangement process.

Sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop. They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)  If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special.   From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed.   Oh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.

The Chicken Ballontine is the absolute best chicken meal I have ever had in my entire life.  About a year ago, I first visited Tricks. I was debating between the Chicken Ballontine and the Airplane Chicken. I asked the waiter who replied, "the Airplane Chicken is a nice meal; it's like a very upscale Thanksgiving dinner and quite delicious."   Me: "And what about the Chicken Ballontine?"  Waiter: "Um, well, about that. Some people have said it's the best chicken they have ever eaten in their entire lives."  Me: "I'll take it."  The Chicken Ballontine is a simply amazing chicken dish. It comes as chicken stuffed with foie gras and brioche stuffing, coated in a cognac demi glaze, with a light layer of seared caul fat surrounding the chicken to give it a crisp, served over greens (kale, I think) over butternut squash.  The dish is absolutely incredible as the flavors blend together. Everything is in perfect balance in this meal and you will find yourself cursing the gods that chicken has been ruined for you in all other forms. Even at $26, it's that good.  I know "best chicken you've ever had" sounded hyperbolic and I thought it was strange for someone to speak *so* highly about a dish. Usually, a waiter will taper their response to make sure they don't look a fool if you dislike it.  This was of no concern to him for good reason.  The chicken was incredible. And then, three weeks later, they switched to their Spring menu, and it was gone.   Distraught, I emailed them asking if it may come back. They mentioned that it was a possibility, but that chef Kelly Fletcher had been forwarded the email.  He responded saying that while he never brings a dish back in rotation, he would make an exception because of the response he had received to it.  When we visited last night, I made a point of mentioning that I had petitioned for the dish's return. The waitress (who was wonderful in all regards) sent chef Kelly Fletcher out to greet us personally. He came out with a grin and asked how we liked it. I explained that I would likely be doing serious damage to my heart several times over for the next few weeks as he had gotten it just right again.  The dish is very complex--he explained that the demi glace is of course homemade and requires ten+ veal bones, the caul fat is a process in its own right, and getting your hands on enough foie gras to use it in a dish like this can be a challenge, but it's absolutely worth it.   It really is the best chicken I have ever had.  (And the goat cheese-cinammon-apple-chutney-with-lime-basil-syrup tart was amazing too, and the perfect end to our evening last night.)

Bill has been around for over 30 years and he is absolutely fantastic. He's great to talk to, offers a keen eye on how best to frame your artwork, and comes up with clever solutions to tricky problems. (He perfectly set a 1/16" thick masonite painting on a mounting frame that let me finally hang my 3' x 4' piece.)  His pricing is fair, he has tons of frame options visible at his shop and will walk you through them in person so you can see what will work best, and he offers quick turnaround times. There's absolutely no reason to go to Michael's when his pricing is so competitive, his expertise is absolutely unmatched anywhere (seriously, more than 30 years of this!), and you get to work with such a nice guy.   If you need ANYthing custom framed, do yourself a huge favor and bring it by Bill's Custom Frames.

Chuckbox is a classic, a great, juicy burger with tons of flavor from their mesquite grill, run-of-the-mill-frozen fries, and a fixins bar that's real nice. They offer up a few extras, like a great chicken sandwich, but the star here is the beef and the charbroil it takes on.  Cash only is obnoxious, but the staff is consistent and the burgers are damn flavorful and good sized.

1 And ye the LORD looked down upon the earth 2 and He saw a hovel on Apache Boulevard 3 and saw fit to populate it with a mere approximation of pescetarian "food" for 4 our God is a vengeful, spiteful, cruel God.  5 The sins committed by the men of Tempe were so wicked as to deserve such punishment 6 that they were never to be spoken of. 7 A pile of horrible, tiny pieces of fish-meal 8 are the LORD's manna from hell, 9 a punishment unlike any other on the soul, mind, and stomach.  10 Requiring only the smallest number of shekels, 11 God sought to tempt even he without sin 12 into sampling its putrid fruit, 13 the punishment for partaking not unlike that of Adam and Eve, having partaken of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  14 As they bit into the crusty, bland fish, 15 they became aware of their horrible betrayal of God and their stomachs 16 and were banished to the restroom for the rest of the evening.   17 "Frozen chunks of pressed fish meal does not fried fish make" sayeth the LORD, issuing several commandments. 18 Thou shall not try the Pete's Sauce for it is awful and I hath spewed it from my mouth as it was lukewarm and tasted horrible. 19 Thou shall not give in to temptation for cheap fish, when it is known that Pete's is neither cheap (for one's soul, if not the wallet) nor fish. 20 A curse upon the household of any man who tries the hamburgers. The cramping of 10,000 stomachs shall be felt upon your own gut, a horrible taste left in your mouth for eternity. 21 You will forever recall the intense disappointment I feel of you as you feel for the meal you consume at Pete's. 22 It shall cast your mouth and gut into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  23 The serpent may tempt with "chips". 24 "Do not heed his words," sayeth the LORD. They are soggy, ill-prepared, and above all, flavorless. 25 The breading hath no flavor but sadness, the fish no flavor but bland meal, both betraying its true genesis: 26 A frozen, preformed patty of processed misery. 27 God condemned this abomination and called, "you are not one of my creatures!"  28 "They shall take only cash, as not even the credit card companies dare near their tainted field," God commanded.  29 The seventh angel will pour out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice will come out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is done!" And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. 30 Now the city was condemned to only ever eat from Pete's forevermore, an eternal damnation, a hell on earth, the sins of man so great, the punishment fitting with God's will.

This is some fantastic pizza. The quality of cheese and sauce is exceptional, and the crust is pretty much spot-on. We get the four cheese, subbing in red sauce, and oh man is it a treat.  Service here is always unflinchingly polite and fast and overall awesome.  I only have a couple gripes, and they're extremely minor: For one, they can't come up with a way of providing me an extra side of red sauce without basically making it a bread appetizer order for an extra $5 or so. Not a huge deal, but not a great way to handle that, and I love to dip the pizza slices in the sauce. Two, their regular black iced tea situation is not one I'm fond of. I think it's unsweetened fountain iced tea which I'm not crazy about. It's made worse by the fact that I keep forgetting and keep ordering it. Three, it's just a bit pricey, but this could be primarily because I'm tacking on a bread appetizer every time. Overall, a single pizza is plenty for me and the girl.  And oh the pizza. The four cheese is just heaven. Some of the best ricotta I've had, mixed lovingly with a few others, including a mean mozzarella. Everything going on with the pizza is just fantastic. The appetizers are great too. (It should be noted that, at least the four cheese pizza does NOT keep at all: the cheeses are too liquidy/fresh to store for any period of time, so keep that in mind and devour the whole thing. It won't be a problem.)  Overall this is a great find with a cute interior in a weird location. They're apparently moving when Big Lots finishes their move so we'll see how that goes but we keep coming back and they keep bringing the goods.

Tott's is some of the best Chinese food in the area. It's insanely affordable, large portions, and NOT the hole-in-the-wall, mom & pop, lighted-pictures-of-the-menu-on-wall-against-a-floral-backdrop style place you've read about in Fortune Cookie Chronicles. (Which is a fantastic read if you like Chinese food & history.)  Instead, it's clean and modern inside, and Young, the insanely nice owner or brother-in-law of owner, is always very kind and generous and funny, to boot.  Now, the food. You'll need to check the menu before you order to make sure they have everything you're used to. While most Chinese restaurants all pick from the same playcard, Tott's bills itself as an "asian diner" and so standbys like moo shu pork are absent. To flesh things out, they add a handful of curries and some other pan-asian dishes you wouldn't normally see. (In the same vein, delivery service is also absent!)  Now that that's out of the way, ignore everything I just said and order the orange chicken. It is the best I have EVER had. (I make sure to order it "not crispy" since the shards-of-chicken approach is UNpleasant to me, which they abide by perfectly.) When it comes out fresh and uncrispy, there is no greater. It is just a bit spicy and has some red chile-type things in the sauce, so be prepared, or ask them to tone it down, but it comes out fresh, and hot, and amazing.   Their chow mein is also fantastic. It's chow mein as it should be: soft noodles, not dry at all, and with tons of vegetables. I have them throw in shrimp, and they always include a big portion of just-right cooked shrimp.  I usually tap things out with an order of their great crab/cheese puffs. They're a bit light on the "crab" side, and might be "krab", but the flavor is amazing and their sweet and sour sauce is fantastic. Some of my favorite cheese puffs, pretty much ever.  If you dare order the pork rolls, a word of warning: they are an entire meal in and of themselves. They are the about as thick as your arm and there are two of them, served with sweet & sour mixed with spicy mustard. They are so big that they have to rubber band the foam container.  The portions are huge for dinner, and at about $11 each, you EASILY have two meals out of them.  Take the time to hit up this place for a different take on great chinese food. And if you ask Young for the orange chicken, not crispy, don't be surprised if he thinks you're me. (That's usually how he recognizes me!)

Durant's is an institution and now that we live just 4 blocks away, the wife and I have been getting our prime rib fix from here far more often than we should.  Durant's knows how to steak. The meal begins with a lovely vegetable crudite on ice and their famous butter garlic leek bread, served by professionals who are friendly and on top of their game, and a support staff that ensures you never see the bottom of your glass.   Not content to simply deliver a solitary piece of meat on the plate like some ultra-high-end chop houses, their steaks include a salad and choice of potato, which is greatly appreciated.  We always upgrade to their Caesar salad, which borders on perfection: the dressing coats everything lightly, the plate is freezing cold as damn well it should be, and the lettuce is extremely fresh and crisp.  If you want to splurge, their shrimp cocktail, while a bit pricey, features four enormous, two-bite-each jumbo shrimp, with a stir-it-yourself-thank-god cocktail sauce with some of the hottest horseradish known to man. The details matter: the lemon they provide has a sheath to ensure that the juice goes on your shrimp and not your date.  The main event is fantastic, though I must admit I've simply never ordered anything other than the prime rib, rare, with a baked potato. It's seasoned beautifully, extremely flavorful, and always served to perfection. The baked potato is good, though I prefer when they're coated in just a bit more salt on the outside. My wife tried their garlic mashed our last time, though, and I think I may have to switch from here on out--they were that good.  Dessert, if your heart allows for it, is also typically great. The strawberry shortcake for two is actually for four, and, pro tip, you can order a half portion and still have enough for three people easily. Our last visit was for my birthday and they brought out their brownie sandwich, which was extremely tasty and appreciated.  We've always had great service, the decor is true to its roots, and if you haven't been during the holidays, Durant's does it UP at Christmas. Do yourself a favor and walk through the kitchen, and thank them for what you're about to partake.

AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.  You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.  Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.  They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.  Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)

FEZ does a damn decent job at most everything they touch. I've been twice now (with groups that like to share) and the quality is high, dishes are flavorful, and the prices are great. Service has been tops both times and the atmosphere is downtempo, laid back, but not blaring-music-loud. Very cool.  I had their mushroom burger my first go around, which was pretty damn tasty, but for being not quite as medium rare as I would've liked. Otherwise, it was damn good.  Today, I split their pomegranate chicken with the fiancee. It was fantastic; perfectly breaded, insanely flavorful, and the chicken was hot while the salad it was served over was still cool, which I really appreciated. (We were there at 3pm on a Sunday; I hope that'd still be the case during their more busy time as well...)  They have great hummus, good sweet potato fries, and fresh, creative salads.   Overall, a fun twist on psuedo-mediterranean, like a more competent Pita Jungle in a sense.

Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.  I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll.   By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.  The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.  I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!

Treachery! Seek it out:  Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.  P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a "gourmet" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced.   Once you've paid nearly $14 for their "orange peel chicken", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.  Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.  Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's "i" so that it would "fit on the signs better," or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great "American Chinese" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of "wok charred beef", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.  The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:  'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. "Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant," Jim told me, pointing at the statues. "It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing." From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'  Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.

I have a confession: For some reason, early on, I wasn't that big a fan of Joe's. We're talking years ago, when I was much younger and the dry-cooked/add-sauce thing didn't appeal to me. How foolish I was.  I absolutely love Joe's. Everything you can order here has so much flavor that you really can do no wrong. The sauce is fantastic, the ribs are delicious and very meaty, and the chicken is delightful.  The staff is friendly and food comes up fast, since it's largely cafeteria-style, with a walk-up window for quick takeaway.   The macaroni and cheese is a must-have, and the buttered corn is great too, and if you're feeling like an insane weight upon your stomach and soul, the jumbo baker will do you in.  While Joe's is tip-top in almost every way, I've stumbled upon in the last 3 hours of a weekday only to find them out of either or both of my favorites: the ribs and chicken. I understand that everything BBQ, when done right, takes some serious time, and thus planning your supply for the late evening is tricky, but nothing breaks my heart more than rolling up to find they're out of my favorites, especially since it's a bit of a drive for me now. (I've taken to calling ahead.)  Secondly, I've always felt that it's about a buck or two too expensive. It's a small detail, but a 2-meat, 2-side meal will set you back nearly $12, though that includes their bread and enough food to send you packing.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is prepared with exceptional care to be absolutely delicious. My very favorite (beef) ribs are at Mining Camp in Apache Junction, but for fantastic (pork) ribs somewhere in the vicinity of society, Joe's is great.  (They also make up part of the "birthday trifecta" of Joe's restaurants--head to here, Liberty Market, or Joe's Farm Grill for a free meal on your birthday. And yes, they encourage you to complete the trifecta and hit all three.)

Essence is good. REALLY good. REALLY REALLY good. High quality ingredients, and unique dishes that leave you quite satisfied. I usually get their big breakfast, with a potato mash and eggs and bacon and this lovely mushroom mix. It's tasty and light and yummy. The scrambled  eggs are perfectly done with a dollop of dijon mustard and taste nearly perfect. The toast is great, and the preserves go perfectly.  I also had the good fortune of trying the quiche for the first time the other day. It was absolutely brilliant. A perfect, buttery, flaky crust. Delicious egg & spinach & baconness. It was everything a quiche should be. The salad that went with was nice, too.  Finally, the macaroons are ridiculous. They're a bit pricey, but they're absolutely fantastic and a real treat. Perfectly done, perfectly flavored, delicious.  My biggest criticism of Essence is that I always feel like I spent a couple bucks more than I should have. The portions are usually just right, but they can run on the small side, and it's easy to spend $11-$15 on lunch, when all is said and done. The lemonade is great but it's homemade and so doesn't include refills. It's such high quality that I don't mind dropping a few dollars over the $10 range I try to stay in for lunch, and generally it really is just enough food, done perfectly, with great quality ingredients.

The Vig is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or late-night for some damn decent food, served up relatively quickly, and with a good variety of dishes to boot.  We showed up around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and there was no wait, seat yourself. We chose to sit outside because the music was just BUMPING inside and we wanted to at least be able to hear ourselves over dinner. We found a nice booth with plenty of room for the four of us, and a waiter (Scott, who was very nice) stopped by within a minute or two, max, to tell us waters were all ready on the way and could he get anything else for us.  I had the Love Me Tenderloin, which was this lovely beef dish served with these fantastic marinated onions & mushrooms, and this wonderful cheese-y potato dish of happiness. Overall, a good experience, and decently priced.  My compatriots had the salmon dish, which was cooked spot on and served with an awesome corn-mash chorizo side, and the potato pancake, which was equally good.  We cleaned our plates, played with some of the Trivial Pursuit cards on our table, and enjoyed a few beers.   Overall, a pleasant experience. Our server was there when we needed him and kept our drinks topped off, and everything came out fine (minus a misheard-for beer early on that was quickly resolved).  I was a bit disappointed that the patio didn't have any misters at all, as it was damn hot if you weren't out under the terrace where they have some cool ceiling fans, and the music was really quite loud even outside, though, to be fair, I think the booth we chose was right under a speaker. It was a live DJ, so I understand the virtue of keeping things up there, but it's a bit rough to have to shout to people across the table.  All in all, we'll probably be back, and I like that their late night menu is served through 1 am.  (Oh, bonus: they have lawn games on this stretch of lawn outside at the patio, including bocce ball!)

Oh god. It's like GOD'S VERY OWN HOT POCKET. Fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, though I have trouble bringing myself to get anything but The Pilgrim (served with turkey, cubed sweet potatoes, onions, and deliciousness). Cornish Pasty is great, though you'll likely want to consider takeout: it's TINY and finding a table can be a real pain.  The staff is fun and helpful, even though they're quite harried, and the oven-roasted potatoes are fantastic, as are nearly all of the pasty options, all priced damn well, to boot. If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me.  Overall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands.

Oh god. The fingers. I award stars based on the context of the restaurant. For a fast/fried food place, this place reigns supreme. I found it on Yelp and I'm so glad I suggested it to the office because holy crap can Alan fry up some chicken.   I love that the breading is light and simple; you're not eating through eight inches of batter. You get right down to business. Meaty, delicious, tender, fresh business. Their chicken is never frozen which goes a LONG way when it comes to quality frying. It's flavorful and fantastic. And whatever their special sauce is (I've heard it referred to as "fry sauce" by Utahans?) really works.  The texas toast is a great touch and the fries are above average, though I'm pretty sure they're frozen and doctored with a bit of seasoned salt kind of flavoring.  Overall, the price is right, the location is CLEAN (and apparently habitually so if you see they've aced their past dozen+ inspections) and the service is friendly, even if Alan is run ragged a bit during the rush.  I wish they were open past 7pm, and I've been hit by an odd day off here and there but we keep coming back because it's just freakin' delicious.

Sprinkles makes a damn fine cupcake. They are an indulgence, and something you should probably only take on once every couple of months, but their frosting is absolutely incredible and the cake is usually paired quite well with it.  My initial impressions, way back when, were that the cake was a bit dry. I learned that by ensuring you have some of the ample amount of frosting smashed in with every bite, there's a perfect balance that really works.  The cake is flavorful and tastes pure and clean. Not laced with filler or with that weird chemical flavor that accompanies any store-bought cupcakes, and not cooked into oblivion, I find them to be delicious.  My absolute favorite is Orange but they only sell it on Tuesdays for reasons passing understanding. The frosting is simple, pure, and delicious, and just the right consistency. I've not had the "hardened" experience of other reviewers at all, but I practice safe cupcaking. (Plastic bag around the box when I bring it home, etc.)  I usually flip mine upside down onto a plate and dig the fork straight through to ensure the proper frosting ratio--but I'm a professional. I've had to stop receiving their Twitter device updates because the free cupcake-a-day siren call was too much for me. (And my heart.)  That said, Sprinkles is expensive. $3.25 for a cupcake is definitely an indulgence, but you truly get what you pay for and this is a fantastic dessert for one.

Chompie's has a ton going for it. They have a stellar bakery (which services a bunch of coffeeshops, restaurants, and groceries throughout the valley with bagels, cookies, cakes, etc.) and fantastic deli food, through-and-through.  Their Mile High sandwiches are absurd. Stacked 6-7" tall, you won't be able to get your mouth around them. Start chipping away from the side and hope for the best.  Breakfast is typically top notch, if a bit pricey. The pickles they bring out absolutely kill me, but that's because I hate pickles more than anything on this earth. The wait can be really bad, even on a weekday--we were seated instantly, but it took a LONG time for the four of our basic food to come out.  On the other hand, the potato latkes, pierogi, brisket, sliders, roasted chicken, matzo ball soup, and basically everything else is DAMN good. Oh, and their bagels are top notch too.  Grab a butter cookie on your way out, or a "character cupcake" done up like a Sesame Street character. (The Cookie Monster one is especially meta.)  Ran by nice people with decent service (when it's not slow), you're sure to get a taste of the classic New York deli right here in Tempe.  Oh, and I'm on the Wall of Shame for failing to complete the terror that is the Slider Challenge. Don't even try it.

I'm not a sushi expert by any stretch, but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced, fresh-tasting, and overall pretty damn delicious, with good presentation.   I'm not a fan of their tea, but that's just a personal preference, I think. I enjoy the Las Vegas, but the Spank Me roll was really good as well. We usually mix and match our way around, and right now they're running a "happy day" 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3, each. Definitely worth it.  Good service, laid back vibe, even if the decor is a little "college dorm" with the lighting, but overall, fun, good food, and affordable.

Scratch is an uncanny experience. Tucked away in a strip mall, next to a Subway, there sits a wonderful French pâtisserie. And recently, they've started serving dinner.  It may seem a rather absurd notion that you could find amazing French cooking in a strip mall next to a Subway, but Duc Liao has managed to deliver in spades. The fashion photographer met his fashion-model wife in Paris and they jetted out to be closer to her mother, chasing a dream to start their own bistro.  Charming story aside, the food is absolutely amazing. I started with a wonderful buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad served with mixed greens and a wonderful balsamic vinaigrette served on the side. The cheese was fresh and delicious and the presentation was spot-on.   I moved on to the brilliant stuffed chicken breast, with a wonderful mushroom and rosemary stuffing, with tarragon and other wonders, served in a delicious sauce with rice pilaf. Absolutely incredible.  My partners in crime had the french onion soup and the foie gras salad. The french onion was a monument to great soup, while the foie gras was simply an insane amount of foie gras served for $14. My $12 chicken and the girlfriend's $5.50 house red really kept things reasonable as well.  As we were the last diners in there on a Thursday night, Duc came out from the kitchen and introduced himself, asking how we were enjoying ourselves. We discussed the lamb that girlfriend was eating and he lit up when she mentioned that medium rare is the best way to go. He began discussing his specialty lamb dish, but said that it typically requires 2-3 people at least to enjoy. He then invited us to call him and plan an evening around it, saying he'd run out and grab the special ingredients necessary and set to the four hour cooking process early in the day for us if we gave him due warning.  Our other companion struck up a conversation on his own attempts with pastry and Duc walked him through some of the challenges and tips and tricks of the trade. The entire experience was absolutely incredible, and I can't wait to celebrate there very soon with our own special herb lamb offering, cooked up just for us by Duc, who absolutely insisted two or three times that we just give him a call and ask.   Our server Howard was also friendly and fast and helpful and knowledgeable; all good things for a waiter. The experience as a whole was already spot-on, but interacting with the co-owner/chef was a treat and a privilege and I can't wait to bring my other foodie friends back for more.  (Oh, and the dome chocolate hazelnut craziness that I had was incredible as well.)  Absolutely wonderful, and worth it in every way. Dress casual or dress up a bit, but don't expect any pretentiousness here. It's just amazing, simple, delicious food served by great people who clearly love their craft.

Middle of the road burger. Decent enough, but nothing special. The fries are decidedly unspecial.  Service is okay, food is pretty quick, even on a game night, and otherwise, it's alright. Much prefer In-n-out or Smashburger, but this does in a pinch.

I'm not going to lie, I come to Charlestons primarily for their oven roasted chicken (which is fantastic, though I wish was available in all dark meat) and their croissants, which should be outlawed for simply being insanely good and perfectly done up.  Their glazed carrots are everything glazed carrots should be: sweet, delicious, and perfectly cooked. Their mashed potatoes have a ton of flavor as well, and even if this is a done-up chain type restaurant, this place gets it right a fair amount of the time. I almost feel guilty enjoying it as much as I do, but it's really damn decent food for a relatively decent price. (I had the burger recently, which was only so-so, as they were out of my chicken, but the champagne vinaigrette salad is awesome.)  Most of the time, I get curbside takeout, which is fast and efficient, but seating inside is nice if there aren't screaming kids. The music trends from decent to absolutely awful, but I don't know how much control anyone there has over that. And it's nice and dark and comfy if you eat in.

Had a fantastic lunch here today. Extremely tasty BLTDCA or whatever they call it. Chicken, dates, pesto mayo, bacon, apples, etc. Really tasty sandwich, great pecan shortbread cookies, yummy salads (though it's a bit of a bummer to eat them jammed up in their plastic cages), and a fantastic spot that feels a good deal removed from the desert. A tad on the pricey side, but really high quality stuff.

Paradise Carpet Cleaning is basically a guy named George. This is to your advantage. You don't have to deal with a scheduler double-booking your technician. You don't have to deal with the overhead associated with a big company. Instead, you have George, and his van, and that's it.  George keeps things simple. Steam cleaning has a set price of 20 cents/square foot. He measures out the carpeted space, and boom, that's your rate. He also takes 10% off for just mentioning Yelp, so that's a big deal too.  He took care of my space and had it looking fantastic, he was able to squeeze me in on just the day I needed him, and he was a genuinely nice guy who didn't try to upsell or put any pressure on. He was on time, did the job well, and charged a more-than-fair price.  I really like working with "just a guy" like George. I know what I'm getting and he took care of things.

I've been mourning the loss of Mai Island Grill since it closed. Desperate for a nearby Chinese fix, my coworker and I swung down to brave Paradise Lost Hawaiian BBQ, as I'm wont to call it.  It's incredibly hot inside. The dining area is air conditioned, but the lobby/foyer where you order, not so much. The food is just barely passable. It lacks the rich flavor that I'd come to associate with good Hawaiian from Mai, and I suppose there's a decent amount of it, but it feels just slopped into a take-out container and there you go. The rice is a too-sticky mess (not in the good way), and the broccoli and macaroni salad were disappointing.  I had the lunch special and the chicken just wasn't doing it for me. My coworker was excited by a big noodle soup bowl an older Korean gentleman was slurping in the dining area, but he was brusquely informed "we no serve soup". So much for that.  The cook was just behind the counter, literally sweating onto the grill, dropping his grill-cleaner on the floor, and having at it again without much of any concern. Now, I know I leave my grill scraper outside and I'm sure I've dropped it, but this is just one of those things that piled on the disappointment. The food was lackluster, but you get a lot of it, and it's relatively cheap.   I won't be back. I'll resign myself to hoping the Mai people come back as they've hinted at on their Facebook and Twitter.

Very simply, these guys are fantastic, if you need your BMW serviced. I had a very specific, very awkward problem. (The MOST connection had been pulled out, deactivating my stereo and SOS system.)  They had me in as a drop-in, and had the problem fixed in 30 minutes. Billed me $45 for the half hour. Done and done.  Insanely friendly, helpful, explained everything, and couldn't ask for more. Having gotten screwed by Chapman BMW so much recently, I'm making these guys my go-tos for maintenance and service.  You just instantly feel you can trust them, and that what they say is what's the case.

Petite Maison is a wonderful little French restaurant run by a couple tucked away in north Scottsdale. I'll admit this: I've never been for their regular dinner. Instead, I've gone to their ingenious late night seating they refer to as "Staff Meal." Staff meal runs from 10pm-midnight on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. The menu varies dramatically and is only revealed on the day of, at around 4pm over their Twitter account. And it's rarely French.  This has the wonderful quality of ensuring something completely new and different will always be on tap. The food served is completely from scratch, "the hard way," no matter what you're ordering, and the pricing for staff meal dishes varies between $8 and $12, with a $5 staff drink to accompany.  Since I've started going to staff meal, I've had the pleasure of enjoying duck tacos, foie gras sliders, fried chicken with homemade ranch, oxtail bbq sandwiches, tuna melt, scallops, philly cheesesteaks, and a bunch of other crazy delights. The quality of the dishes is always absolutely top notch, each with their own fun "fine dining" take. The portions are a bit small, but our group splits a cheese platter, and for $10, no one can complain.  The staff at Petite Maison is absolutely fantastic. They're attentive, and the owners like to get to know each and every one of their guests when they can. They're passionate about great cooking and staff meal is a fun concept where they allow their sous chefs to create the dishes, giving them flexibility they wouldn't otherwise get at other restaurants.  They still include some regular menu items like their escargot and their incredible pommes frites as well, and they have a fantastic bar with some absolutely delightful and exotic liqueurs.   Staff meal is typically the highlight of my week, but I've heard amazing things about their regular menu as well so I figure I'll have to make it out before ten one of these days.

I finally had a chance to try Petite Maison for my birthday dinner and let me say, they absolutely exceeded my expectations.  Start with the service. Chad & Mike have been my usual waiters when I've swung through on Staff Meal, so I was happy to see they'd be helping take care of us for dinner. Both of them represent the absolute top of the trade with regards to waitstaff. Mike is fantastic tending bar while Chad has an encyclopedic knowledge of every single food, special, beer, wine, and cocktail on the menu, and both bring a passion to their craft you may not be used to seeing.  I had a porterhouse special for two that was cooked perfectly, with some incredible potatoes and asparagus (and on a follow-up for my brother's birthday, tried their menu regular steak frites to fantastic effect).  Try the pommes frites--you'll be amazed that "fries" can taste so good, even if you end up using them as a simple vehicle to get more aioli in your mouth. You *will* destroy your napkin though, if you're eating them as finger food, as they're coated in paprika and other spices.  Overall, everything was spot on, and I couldn't be happier. These are people who are passionate about ensuring you have a great dining experience and it really shows. Make sure you get reservations, since they are VERY small inside (around 35 seats?) and they can get completely slammed quickly.

Either Lolos you choose, you're going to end up with some of the best fried chicken in town and some pretty damn amazing waffles too. Service is quick. Waffles are insane. Portions are huge. Chicken is great. Cheese-eggs are a godsend. And the Kool-Aid is entirely opaque. Terrifyingly so. Likewise, avoid the Sweet Tea if you're diabetic, or ask them to cut it half-n-half with the regular tea because DAMN is it sweet.  If you're in the Phoenix location, you may have this sneaking suspicion that you'll come out to find your car up on blocks, but I've never had any trouble and if it's that much of a concern to you, the Scottsdale location is all nice and pretty.  Four stars only because the chicken has been a bit skin/batter-heavy and in a way that hasn't been amazing the last couple of times I've gone. When all's said and done though, you can't beat the combo.   Do yourself a huge favor and order less than your starving self thinks you need. The waffles will fill you up quicker than you can imagine and the syrup (while not of the Maple variety) just tacks it on.   Nice folks, great food, fun times.

Smashburger provides absolutely fantastic tasting burgers. There is a great deal of flavor in each burger and it's delicious. The bun is great, the cheese is great, the burger is great. The smash fries are really quite good as well, though they can get just a BIT oily.  $10 buys you a burger, fries, and drink, with tax, which is firmly right near Five Guys and Chuckbox. I'm a MUCH bigger fan of Smashburger than Five Guys, and it's neck-and-neck, burger-quality with Chuckbox. (They're different flavors, and Chuckbox's mesquite-grilling goes a LONG way, but their fries are freezer fries and bleh.)  The staff is very friendly, they typically hit their 5-7 minute statement, and it's one of my favorite burgers anywhere now. Definitely a good place.

FnB is a wonderful treat: vegetables prepared beautifully and uniquely, impeccable service, and a general sense of wellness that accompanies a meal that doesn't miss a beat. Pavle treats everyone as if they're family and walked us through a tour of the lagos, skirt steak, roasted potatoes, and so much more.  The lagos was a wonderful turkish-inspired bread dish served with enormous orbs of roasted elephant garlic, which we spread "like butter", served with a nice cream sauce. It was fantastic.  The skirt steak was perfectly prepared and served over an interesting cold salsa of roasted corn and apricot and some other goodies, with a chimichurri sauce on top. Spot on, and an interesting blend of textures and flavors.  And the potatoes. I did not know you could do such things to potatoes. Roasted and charred perfectly, with a nearly spongy crunch to them, served with delicious melted cheese and an egg on top.  The menu rotates pretty frequently so I won't go into too much detail of the several other dishes we had but I'll say they were all pitch-perfect, up to the amazing butterscotch pudding we had for dessert.  This is one of those special meals that will warm you over as you get to try new approaches to interesting ingredients. Each step is exciting and different and tastes fantastic. I'm not a wine drinker, so I can't comment on the Arizona-only wine selection, but I've heard good things and with everything else being so spot-on, I'd be surprised if it were to be found a shortcoming.  I plan on coming back in the next quarter when the menu shifts up again, but that's only because I'm trying my hardest not to come back immediately and do it all again.

I'll keep this one simple. Do yourself a favor and hunt this truck down. I've had crepes from a street stand in Paris. TGF makes you feel like you never left (oppressive heat notwithstanding).  I had my first experience with TGF today, just before they wrapped up. I had the People's Choice: a simple crepe jam-packed with Nutella, peanut butter, and bananas. It was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. Tack on their great pommes frites with the truffle oil ketchup and you have a serious winner. To top it off, Jeff hooked me up with a sample of his new custard creation which was absolutely fantastic.  Friendly people, great food, and they're on wheels! Now to find a way to get them down to Mill Avenue, where I work...

Mabels feels almost like a speakeasy; some forgotten 1920s haunt, dimly lit and awkwardly tucked away off of the main drag in Old Town Scottsdale. It is run efficiently by capable, friendly staff who genuinely enjoy chef Aaron May's fun cooking and who know how to pour a drink.  Up until this point in your life, you've likely never tried a deviled egg burger: a burger lovingly prepared with a smattering of delicious deviled egg, with a perfect bit of cheese all on a wonderful english muffin of sorts. This simple fact needs to be remedied: try one at your earliest convenience.  It will get everywhere, as the burger is too big for its britches, and the deviling helps not a bit with cleanliness, but the flavor is fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable.  The shrimp cocktail brings about a very few (four, I believe, in my case) enormous shrimp, but at roughly $2.25 a pop, I don't think I'd repeat, though the cocktail sauce is delightfully prepared and the shrimp are as big as your fist.  The bar is wonderful and eccentric, and on Tuesdays, you can attempt to stump Chef May. Though I haven't tried yet, it sounds like a world of fun in its own right. Better still, they pour heavy, which is good as the cocktails can run in the $7-$14 range.  Overall, the atmosphere is subdued; you almost hope it'll be smoky each time you walk in. The stamped tin roof is fun and the penny-floor is a quirky touch in the men's bathroom. And don't forget to ask about Moby Dick.   A good date place with a small but expertly prepared menu, but easily a $60 night for two if you each have a meal and two drinks. The happy hour, though frustratingly placed in the middle of the work week, is an amazing deal and I might just have to try to convince the office to abscond one Thursday.

This place does what it says on the tin. Modern, updated, comfortable room. King-sized bed with a queen-sized pullout, which was nice. Decent bathroom, though a lightbulb was dead (and promptly replaced). Could hear a good bunch of noise in the adjoining suite until 6am, but not enough to explicitly keep me awake. Otherwise comfortable.  I paid $108/night for what was supposed to be $186/night rooms, courtesy Priceline. Checkin was just fine, but it was at about 1am. Centrally located, though a bit of a walk through the PH casino to get back to the strip proper. Overall, you're right in the thick of it, though.   Nice blackout shades, remote controlled on the TV, along with AC and such. Definitely had trouble waking up cold and dry, as the AC was a bit finicky, but rather that then hot and uncomfortable. Shower was a bit weird, but nothing too big to carp on.   Overall, what we were looking for at a fair price. No resort fees and no parking fees either make it really attractive.

RigaTony's has been a standby for me for as long as I can remember. I even went there for prom night, many years ago. I've been to both of the old locations, and more recently to the new one, and I've tried a good deal of their menu.  I find that the quality of their food is usually pretty damn spot-on. I've been disappointed with my food only once or twice; my normal favorites like the Chicken Picatta are absolutely fantastic and topped with a great mix of tomatoes and capers and such, and perfectly cooked and breaded. The Italian Sausage is fantastic, and the stuffed shells are great too, but the alfredo is usually a bit... tacky. The sauce is a bit thick in that it's usually lopped on top and doesn't mix well, though it's pretty tasty even after that.  There's enough special about this place to keep you coming back and enjoying yourself. Instead of the industrial strength, flavorless slabs of breaded sad-chicken I've found at other nearby Italian places, the overall quality is really enjoyable for "mid-range" Italian food.   The prices are fantastic: $16 or so for a "Tour of RigaTony's" that includes the picatta, sausage, shells, and alfredo is spot on, and easily two meals. The bread is incredible (ask for some scampi butter instead of the oil for a fun treat) and the salad and house dressing are REALLY good.   The service is hit-or-miss. I haven't been to the new location during any sort of dinner rush, just once a bit later where our server was just fine, but I've been disappointed by the service (especially at the old Brown location) so many times that I've taken to just taking out. RigaTony's travels well, and their carry-out deals include the salad, bread, and usually a dessert, including their tasty chocolate cake.  Not much of an oenophile or drinker in general, so I can't comment on the wine selection at all, but overall, you can have a tasty experience here with generally high quality food all around. Little improvements could make things a lot better, and I'll have to report back the next time I visit during dinner on the service, but I've been going for years and I love the place.  (Oh, one final thing: their lunch specials are INSANE. They vary from day to day, but you can be in and out in about a half hour for $7 with some GREAT food!)

We hit up Tapas Papa Frita for Restaurant Week. First, let me just say that Restaurant Week should represent a deal of some sort. Fortunately, it did here. $29 got you an entree, tapas, dessert, AND a glass of sangria or house wine, so roughly a $10-$12 discount. Perfect.  The tapas were pretty well executed. I enjoyed the Pimiento de Piquillo con Centollo: Crab-stuffed peppers in a saffron sauce. They were incredibly good. The Chorizo just wasn't for me; VERY smoky, but my dinnermates enjoyed it. The Espada de Solomillo left a bit to be desired; nothing was wrong with it, but it just felt uninspired. Finally, the Tortilla de Patatas (Spanish potato pie) was tasty and well-executed, and a decent portion at just $4.50. (The other tapas were closer to the $7-$9 territory, but this was AZ Restaurant week, so we weren't paying attention.)  Our server was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and there when we needed her. She even quietly placed the dessert spoon properly for my left-handed friend; something he noticed, but the rest of us wouldn't have ever caught, since she simply did it and brought no attention to it. Very good attention to detail with something like that.  Our entrée were quite decent, but the paella valenciana was a bit lacking for me. It was a bit light on the seafood, and seemed almost hastily put together in a sense. It was tasty, but it wasn't absolutely incredible, and I think I prefer Pepin's, though I haven't tried it in some time.  They rounded things out with a fantastic creme brulee and an incredible apple dish called the Manzana al horno: Chocolate-stuffed apple with a Cider-Chantilly cream. It was absolutely fantastic, and had a bite of mint to it.   The sangria also got good reviews, though I stuck to my teetotaling ways.   Overall, a pleasant experience that left us just the right amount of full. I enjoyed the blend of tapas and entrée, and though I wasn't blown away by the paella, I think I'll be back. It was a really enjoyable time, and the live music was great too. (The serving staff costumes were a bit on the nose, but it's part of the ambiance, I suppose.)

With Sucker Punch Sally biting the big one in just a few months, I'm a bit cautious to give my heart away to another new place on Mill. I don't want to get burned again.  That said, we gave Stan's the opening day try today. It was definitely... opening day. The staff was friendly, but everything was a bit chaotic as they're still getting their sea legs under them.  Our sandwiches came out with the wrong bread on them, but that was quickly addressed and taken care of, no big deal, and our waitress Lindsay was extremely nice.   While things were a bit crazy, everyone was making sure we were taken care of, and we had management and waitresses alike visiting regularly to keep on top of things.  I had the roast beef sandwich with lettuce, mayo, and provolone. The roast beef was nice and rare, and the sandwich was overall quite tasty. It was pretty loaded down with meat, which helps against the $9 cost. That $9 is about on par with Chompie's, who sells a sandwich loaded with even MORE meat for about $11 and a half for $8.  The fries were decent, but definitely of the frozen variety, so nothing to sneeze at there. My friend had the pastrami on onion roll and seemed to enjoy it. He also took down a chocolate milkshake and a slice of chocolate cake that was massive and dense in a way few cakes I've tried are. VERY good cake. (Though they should track down the pie chef from Sucker Punch and have her come in for pie, as they offer none and Sucker Punch's pies were simply the best I had EVER had, ever.)  I wasn't terribly impressed with my macaroni salad, but it's macaroni salad--I don't know where you go to make it fantastic, you know?  I'm going to give these guys another couple of weeks to get the swing of things and give it another shot. They have a bunch of stuff on the menu I'm happy is in walking distance from my office, like a basic egg salad, grilled cheese, tuna salad, regular salads, burgers, pizzas, deli sandwiches, and breakfast served all day--no launching with a half or partial menu at all, which I take to be a good sign.  The staff is very friendly and they seem to really want to hit the ground running. They're also open til 10 every night and til midnight on weekends, which is pretty darn wise of them. Rumor has it, they'll be adding some form of alcohol by September, so we'll see how that rolls. I'd be surprised if they didn't extend to stay open for the last call crowd once school starts up.  Overall, a good experience with friendly people, and I'm betting it only gets better.

Bliss is really really really good. Perfect pork chop, fantastic mac n cheese, great service, great pricing, quiet and good service the couple of times I've been. I need to try a few more things before I bump this up to 5 stars, but it's essentially a 5 star in my mind.  Was really pleased with this place.

I first sampled Chef Beckett's food at staff meal at Petite Maison. He had cooked up an amazing grilled cheese with pancetta and tomato bisque. Happily, that's on the menu at his own restaurant, which just opened this last week.  The girlfriend and I decided to try out Beckett's new restaurant tonight and we were simply thrilled. The food included huge portions at fair prices, and it helped that it was delicious. I had the braised short ribs with mashed potatoes and green beans ($19), the girlfriend had the chicken and dumplings ($16). The bread was made in the wood-fired oven and delicious, and the bacon-cheese biscuits ($5) were fantastic. (The bread was so good, I may actually forgo the biscuits next time, sadly!)  Even though it's brand new, the service was absolutely perfect. Our helpful waitress (Tracey) was able to recommend a perfect wine pairing for the girlfriend's meal and was attentive and in a very good mood for being rather close to closing time.  My short ribs were perfectly cooked, full of flavor, and enough to bring home for seconds (factoring in dessert). The girlfriend had plenty of chicken and dumplings leftover and loved her meal, and though she mentioned it was just a bit on the saltier side, she was thrilled to have enough for lunch the next day.  We rounded things out with the chocolate-covered bacon s'mores. That's right. They arrive deconstructed, with each component piece separate on the plate for you to build to your liking. Housemade marshmallow, peanut butter cream, chocolate covered bacon, and graham crackers make for a unique and fun dessert that's just the right amount of food, though it feels utterly indulgent.  The chef and his owner-partner also made sure to greet us and were extremely kind. It's clear they've put a lot of passion into the space and the menu and the food, and it really shows. There are a bunch of things on the menu I'm excited to try--a good thing, as the experience was just fantastic from top to bottom.

Damn this place is damn good. Damn. Damn damn. Walked in, was greeted by who I presume was the proprietor explaining how things are done: deli-style, by the pound, ala carte. Had a meal deal for $9 for, I think, 1/3 pound of pork loin, brisket, or turkey. I chose the pork loin. Tender, delicious. Two slices of white bread ("you get however much white bread you want, but you have to eat it all"), amazing mac n cheese, fantastic sweet tea... yeah, we'll be back.  Obligatory gripe about cash only--in the age of 2.75% and no transaction/rental costs Square, this kinda thing chafes me a bit: it feels like a push to use the ATM which ALWAYS hurts ($5 on $20 is just absurd, when you factor in your bank and the ATM fee of $2.50) but fortunately I had cash this time around. It's just one of those things that will make the guys in the office think twice, if they don't happen to have cash with them, and I completely agree.  That said, service was AMAZING, guy brought out a sample of their chopped beef as well, everyone was unfailingly polite, that sweet tea, seriously, fantastic, good sauce, good smoke, good BBQ.

As literally the closest sandwich shop possible to where I live (I'm in the same complex), the perky Arizona Sandwich Company surprised me with dirt cheap, huge, fresh tasting, damn good sandwiches, made right.  I get the Italian Bomber most times, which is loaded down with salami, ham, and pepperoni, along with lettuce, dressing, mayo, and the works. It's delicious, the bread is fantastic, and it's HUGE. The $5 "shorty" is more than enough to fill me up.  They're fast, friendly, and really tasty. I hate Jimmy Johns and I'm not at all fond of Subway, so I'm glad that there's a local sandwich shop that I can actually enjoy. Even better that I live one building over.

What a great venue! It's as if someone said to themselves "perhaps we shouldn't do everything as cheap as humanly possible, they'll come anyway". Instead, real thought went into basics like the vibe and general look and feel of the place, their relatively small but quite tasty and well-priced menu, their friendly staff, and even the layout of their main stage area.   Thoughtfulness basically permeates Crescent from top to bottom and it made a concert more fun than the normal sweaty, angry ragefest most shows tend to be, to the extent that a venue can control that.  Enjoyed myself and enjoyed that they really knew what they were doing up and down the line. As venues go, probably my favorite in the state now.

Sweet heavens there's a good breakfast place on Mill now!  NCounter is fast, fun, and tasty. Great portions, good variety, well-executed meals. I've been three times this week, and I've noticed a few minor missteps, but it's their first week and they're off and running.  Loved the bananas foster french toast (though the bananas were a little cool, as was the bacon that came with), not sure if they use real maple syrup, since it was coated in awesome... wouldn't mind clarification on that.  A bit annoyed that they only have Minute Maid lemonade, and a few other things seem to be more quick-and-dirty versions than home-grown versions (the potatoes for instance, which are tasty, but don't strike me as homemade like Liberty Market's or Matt's Big Breakfast.)  Fantastic toast and jam, and good eggs. I tried their chicken sandwich on Foccacia today and it was delightful. Good portion, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The atmosphere is fun, the cupcakes are dangerously dense and delicious, the seating is flexible, and the service was incredibly friendly and darn fast.   I wish a few things were a bit higher quality, but that's because I've been spoiled to death by Matt's & Liberty's take-no-prisoners approach. NCounter is a great fit, they've done great things with the space, and seriously: three times this week, the office has trekked on down there.

Paletas Betty sells fantastic paletas (ice cream bars) that are completely homemade, and delicious. I tried their fresa con crema and it was delightful. Full of strawberries and perfectly sweetened, it was extremely tasty.   They change their menu frequently, and that's a bit of a concern since there are already about 9 flavors I'm dying to try. Friendly, $2.75 a pop, and each one includes a sticker, which is fun.  I dig that these are light and made with sugar and real fruit and spices and stuff, so they don't taste artificial or syrupy or anything like that. They're a good size for a snack, but that's not to say it's going to become a healthy habit for me to munch through a few of these every week, especially considering they're a stone's throw from my office...

Chick, I wanted to love you so. I order oven roasted and rotisserie chickens all the time from restaurants that do them really well. Chick's not quite there yet. It's also brand new, so I have high hopes.  For one, things are a bit expensive. They at least have quarter chicken portions, and the sides are accommodating: You get a big ol' artichoke for your side which was decent, and a bunch of whipped potatoes. The potatoes are a bit soupy, mostly by virtue of swimming in butter; when they first came out I had them with sour cream, chives, and cheese, and they were just too salty. The chef came out and we mentioned that and he brought back a huge bowl of the regular whipped potatoes that were really quite tasty.   Our friends had the roasted vegetables, which were carrots and parsnips. Not much to write home about, right? Wrong. They were actually fantastic, crispy and bright and with a bit of something that made them really pop. If more of the sides hit like that, we'd be closer to home run territory.   My girlfriend got the pot pie. It was actually really tasty, the crust was fantastic, and it had that hearty kinda inside to it. Could've used a dash of salt (perhaps stolen from my potatoes) but other than that, it was really good.  The service was slow, and the server misheard our friend ordering a half glass even though she repeated it twice, and brought out a full glass (and charged for it). Even still, he got basically everything else right and was able to split the check just fine. We did have about a 35-40 minute wait from ordering entrees to seeing the food, and they were a bit busy but that's a bit much in general. The biscuit appetizers came out right quick.   The wine concept is really cool. They use those purging machines that allow them to pour any quantity they want without affecting the other wine: it fills the bottle with an inert gas so that they can do that with literally any bottle, and they have a large selection available. I'm not a wine drinker, but my other guests liked the idea.  The chicken just lacked pizzazz for me. For a place that's built around that entirely, I think they need to amp it up a bit. Even from a chain like Charlestons, they know how to season and roast a mean chicken. Here, there wasn't much of any flavor on the outside, and while I didn't have that dryness others have complained about, it just didn't reach out and grab me. Especially for a $9 quarter chicken, organic or not. I'd like to see more flavor there. It was okay, but it wasn't magical.  The sauces are pretty neat and the honey truffle sauce was pretty tasty, but I don't know if I should have to rely on sauce to jazz up something like roasted chicken. They definitely add something though, and the variety is unique. (I tried the creamy garlic as well.)  I'll say this: the chef came out to talk to us and after replacing the potatoes, he was really nice and brought out some of his cheese biscuits as well which were pretty tasty. He was incredibly friendly and you can tell he's working really hard on building this out.   For that, I'll give it a few more months and give them another shot to see if they get their sea (or chicken) legs underneath them.

Q Up makes exceptionally tasty BBQ. Their Gangsta Grilled Cheese has become my Wednesday go-to: it's a sloppy, barely-containable mess of brisket, melted cheese, their great homemade BBQ sauce, and their homemade mac 'n cheese, all served up on a great sourdough.  Their hand-cut fries are a perfect addition (though their tortilla chips are really great too) and I'm finding it nearly impossible to pull myself away from Q Up to any of the other food trucks.   The wait is never that bad, even with a bit of a line, and you never go away hungry. Q Up isn't just "good as food trucks go." It's absolutely fantastic BBQ, great sauce, great meat, and insanely flavorful, if a bit damaging to the heart and waistline...

To paraphrase Hamlet, "Get thee to the Crêpe Bar!"  I've been a fan of Jeff's since the days of the truck, but he's brought crepes to a whole new level here. They're simply delicious, bursting with flavor, and perfectly prepared. I had the grilled chicken with onions, cheddar, arugula, and an herb sauce that complimented everything perfectly. Finished with a dash of pesto and a touch of sea salt, you really couldn't ask for more.  I had to razz Jeff a bit about the lack of duck-fat frites, but he told me that was owing to the lack of a hood in their kitchen and that he was hoping to experiment a bit with his oven.  Either way, the price is right, the crepes are absolutely BRILLIANT, and Jeff & co. are just lovely people to visit.  Do yourself a favor and have a lovely crepe lunch or dessert. They're really stick-with-you fantastic.

Pig & Pickle is extremely, extremely good. They have a fun obsession with sneaking pig into as many items as they can that fortunately doesn't carry over to the pickle side of things, which I'm thankful for.  I had their lovely pork belly appetizer and their amazing burger. Amazing because it was charred on the outside, in such a way that when it was first delivered, I was worried they had screwed the pooch on "medium rare". Except that as I cut into it, it broke into an example of the most radiant, beefy splendor, perfectly cooked, with no ketchup necessary. A perfect tomato, the right amount of lettuce, and some delicious cheese. This, my friends (and to paraphrase a scene in How I Met Your Mother) is a BURGER.  Their desserts were great as well, and everyone really loved their slightly different take on things and quirky menu options. We'll definitely be back.

Matt's has become what some may say is an addiction of mine. I prefer "hobby". But Matt's did make it into our wedding vows. (True story.) You see, since I first tasted the glory of the Five Spot, I've basically made it a point to get one on every available weekend day. So my wife thought it wise to pledge support publicly in front of friends and family for my perhaps less-than-healthy "hobby".  The wife works a lot of weekends, and I've found out that the Five Spot can travel the 10 minutes or so to my home largely intact. A perfectly balanced combination of spot-on eggs, melted cheese, grilled onions, and THE best bacon possible makes this the absolute best egg sandwich I've ever had.   Every ingredient is so delightfully high quality that the sandwich shines, bursting forth with flavor and cholesterol and existential angst. (Or, as some might call it, "maple syrup that I dip it in".)   Make sure you order a side of home fries. They're specifically not included with the sandwich which is "how they get ya", but I can't go without. Crisp, delicious potatoes served with a few sprigs of rosemary and... also dipped in syrup.   I had over 140 check-ins to Matt's before they moved and Yelp created a new profile for them. Every single one of them? A Five Spot with Home Fries. I'm pretty sure if you ordered a "Chris", that's what you'd get at this point.   Their waffles are amazing too, along with basically everything else on the menu. Absolutely perfectly fluffy, flavorful, and delicious, from what I've stolen off the wife's plate. And Erenia and the rest of the staff are as kind and amazing as can be.  The wait is rough, there's no doubt about that. But whereas most breakfast places slog along with watery eggs, sub-par, see-through bacon, horrible, waxy cheese, and no twists or turns, Matt's gets it perfectly right every time. Or at least all 140 times and counting.

Pallets needs a bit of work. The decor is fun, but I could've done without MMA on the TV. That said, the service was fine, the tea was fine, and my pork fried rice was decent. The egg rolls were also decent. Two of my friends were more than a bit disappointed with their dishes; one was severely lacking in substance (where "vegetables" meant literally a piece of lettuce and cucumber) and the pork with fried egg and steam rice was very light on the pork.  The outside patio is pretty nice, and again, the people were nice and attentive. Honestly, I'd like to rate closer to 2.5, but it just wasn't fantastic.

Wow this pizza is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. We had the mozzarella margherita, which was one of their "Napoletana certified" flavors, and it was exceptional. They use imported San Marzano tomatoes and imported moz and they blend together in this perfect way that packs far more flavor into a three topping pizza than you would ever guess.   Our server was fantastic, the meat plate we started with was top notch, and the pizzas take barely 90 seconds in the 900° oven, so they come out crisp but not scalding hot, which was just fine for us.  We had a lot of fun, and for $14 for a pizza with enough to share for two (especially with a light appetizer), we'll definitely be back. A lot.

I've had a few pies here now, and I appreciate what they're trying to do, but I've been underwhelmed every time. My biggest issue is with the crust. Crust should be a beautiful, flaky, slightly salty base that provides some contrast and structure to the filling. Pie Hole/Mamma's crust is just extraordinarily bland.  Several of my friends have said much the same (and a few of the other commenters here) and I think that it really holds things back. The fillings are perfectly respectable and sometimes even quite good, but the crust is just nothing to write home about and it really dings the overall experience for me.

Damn good burgers, freshly-ground beef every day, damn good dogs, and Faygo. If you're missing your Coney fix, these guys are doing it right. The fries are great, the food is fast, and everyone is extremely nice, even on the crazed opening day we came in for the tail end of. Do yourself a favor and swing on by.

A superbly enjoyable meal here, from top to bottom. We had the artichoke and arancini and both were extremely good and perfectly prepared. I then had the filet and the wife had the bolognese. The filet was just surprising in its presentation and flavor. I'm not typically a fan of sauce on steaks but this was exceptional all around and perfectly cooked. The wife loved her bolognese as well.  Finally, the nookerdoodle dessert was insane and brilliant, and the service was excellent. Our waiter Ralph was just on point.  We'll definitely be back. A real fun menu, great staff, and delicious.

Wanted to like Clever Koi more than I did, and maybe I'm a bit too picky regarding Asian fusion and certain flavors, but my dish was only... alright, and my tablemate's dish was insanely, INSANELY salty, nearly to the point of inedibility. (I believe she had the tofu kimchi fried rice, but I don't remember exactly.)  We had a couple other misses that night: dishes that had potential but whose specific execution made them a bit too strong in one direction and not well-rounded or enjoyable as full meals, and the place was slammed so service was a bit slow.  I had the Chicken Katsu, which was alright, but the nori was a bit off-putting next to fried chicken for me. Typically a meal I'm not crazy about would net a 3 star, but three out of four of us were unimpressed overall, and my friends are nowhere near as picky as I am. They just didn't love the specific executions they were served.

It simply does not get better than Merci and the masterpieces Duc provides. The most generous of spirit chef you'll find, Duc puts his heart and soul into crafting perfect plates of amazing from Scratch.   Everything is of the finest quality and honestly the most delicious preparation. Homemade buns and sauces for the burgers, the best quality beef and turkey and lamb, insanely great sandwiches and salads: you won't regret a single item on the menu.  His dinners are no different: insanely high quality at a price point that honestly doesn't make sense. It's so affordable you wonder how there isn't a line out the door, and perhaps consider not telling your friends to keep it that way, but it's just so good that you can't keep it to yourself.  Do yourself a favor and take a few friends to Merci for a wonderful lunch. Do call if you head over for dinner; they're still establishing their firm dinner hours, so letting them know you're coming during their tentative dinner hours (on Wed-Sat) is a good idea.  They'll take amazing care of you. And try the pastries. They'll blow you away as an encore.

What a fantastic time! The whole crew and all of the staff are just wonderful, the entire process is fun, and the ride was great. Even better, the meal at the end was delightful, all around. There's something really cool about having a gourmet prepared meal served out in the middle of wherever you just landed.   Honestly a great experience and wouldn't change a thing!

Eric was recommended through another installer who wasn't confident they could handle the job, brick on an older house. (I appreciated their candor!)  Eric was phenomenal: he showed up on time, walked us through the process, and then set to work. His work was as close to art as you could expect to see on a dog door installation. He had to go into plaster and through the baseboards, and it ended up flawlessly.  He's also an extremely kind, genuine person, and that comes across in his work and interaction. Unfailingly polite, and the sort of person you should have no compunction about inviting into your home.  His workmanship was incredible; it looks like the house was built around the dog door. He went through 73-year-old brick with the care and attention necessary to ensure a flawless installation.   He was even cheaper than Hale while installing a Hale door, and able to provide their warranty as well. If your dog door installation project is a bit tricky (or even run of the mill), experience is what separates a clean install from a botched, expensive ordeal. Eric has over 16 years of experience doing this and it shows.  Honestly, one of the nicest contractors I've ever had the pleasure of working with. You won't be disappointed.

I've been a long-time fan of House of Tricks and Chef Kelly's work there, so it's no surprise that he's bringing it to the waltz, so to speak, just a few blocks away at The Revival.   We swung by for lunch today and I had a fantastic short rib sandwich with great fries, while my lunchmates thoroughly enjoyed their grilled cheese, duck sliders, and reuben sandwich. The host and server were quick and took care of things, and while they're still getting their build-out situated, the food was completely fantastic. I'm excited to try out dinner.

Tempe Dogs is the only place I'd ever bring my boys to. They're staffed by fanatical dog people who just love animals through and through. It's an original concept: open boarding, live-staffed 24/7, 365. It's nearly impossible to find any other boarding service with this combo and it's perfect for active dogs that like to play. Basically, it's like an entire day at an indoor dog park.  The other reviewer who left a one star review is frankly delusional. Yes, you may have to ring the bell if no one is up front because they're sometimes back with the dogs. There are plenty of women who work there (4 of whom I can name off the top of my head), but way to judge a place based on your one single visit. The place definitely has a smell. It's the disinfectant they use. And I won't lie, my boys come home with a bit of that scent on them, but that's because they're so rigorous with how they clean (and golden coats are sponges.) It's not to everyone's liking, but it's what they do to keep the place safe. And as for her fourth opinion about "boys scruffing dogs," I really have no clue what they're talking about. I know that the staff is just crazy about dogs and treating every single one of them like family, and playing with them the right way. They're insanely generous, and loving, and it shows in everything they do, but most importantly, it shows in how our boys respond to the place. THEY LOVE IT.   Taking them to "the place" as we call it (in contrast to the park, where it's too damn hot right now) gets them so excited they BOWL me over when I open the door.   Tempe Dogs does everything right. The pricing is insanely competitive, they treat your dogs like family, they're available whenever (literally WHENEVER) you need, including being able to call at 2am to check in, they take tons of photos and videos and post them to Facebook so you can follow along on longer stays, and they're just wonderful.  My boys come home thoroughly exhausted and contented, and as young goldens, I couldn't be happier that they're getting the exercise and socialization they crave.  Take your dog for a test visit and see how happy they are. If they love a dog park, they'll LOVE this place. Almost every other kennel only promises "at least an hour of social time!" and most charge way more. I don't think I've found any that offer true 24/7 live staffing, either. (Usually, they'll have a caretaker around in case of emergencies, but you can't call them to check on your pups or check out at 2am if your flight gets in late.)  This place is run by phenomenal people who do great work. Couldn't be happier with my dozens of nights and days I've had the boys there.
