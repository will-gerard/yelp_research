Rhythm Room- by far PHX's best venue.   It will be no shocker in 2010 when every concert goer in PHX becomes acquainted with Rhythm Room. It's going to pick up the slack for Phoenix's lack of venues...which is good, b/ this place is great. Way better than the clubhouse...21+ can actually see the stage!   I'm rooting for you Rsquared.

um, this place is great!   definitely for the person that does not want to compromise the aesthetics of a nice set of frames!!!   family operated local business, I found them on Yelp and then went in to see what they were about.  I am REALLLY picky when it comes to eyewear, I have very particular taste, and definitely know what I want in a pair of glasses. I found the style of glasses I had been searching everywhere for within 2 minutes of being in the store, and trust me-no small feat! They are funky, geeky, clear acetate heaven...so pomo...aanyways, just go here! It is great!

Have you ever felt the sentiment of when something is so bad it actually surpasses its badness and becomes good?  now let me ask you this......have you ever had that feeling where its so bad it becomes good then goes back to bad then meagerly yet triumphantly manages to fall into the GREAT category???   I give you... ORGAN STOP PIZZA!!!!!  Rule #1 You will want to be under the influence of ANYTHING upon entering this establishment.  -TRUST!!! ordering here is a nightmare..it's a really weird system..u may have to barter and/or trade wives or something to get pizza....could be cash only.. idk (or can remember [ I adhere strictly to Rule #1]) but do you really go for the pizza...or the experience-- this word needs to be italicized.  Rule #2 -You must drink alcohol while in this establishment!!! For your own sake! (be surprised they even serve alcohol here!)  Rule #3 - It is encouraged to request crazy-ass songs... "they" (being the crazy exclusive largest organ on earth made of cellophane/cardboard/packing tape illustrious organists) seriously know everything!! They even know Beyonce! for real, I swear one time they played "Crazy In Love".   -Also, you can totally take credit for this, but suggest to your friends a game where your group is versus every other patron/family there and try to totally dominate the request bowl.  here's a hint: suggest- "moon river", anything disney ("under the sea" boasts actual bubbles that float down from the ceiling and land in your pizza), I don't know the name of it but we call it the 'crazy cat song'...it includes a puppet show of 4 janky-azz cats that bop up and down behind the organist....they seriously look like they got the mange. definitely request that one..it WILL get played. in fact that's the only reason we go anymore..for the cats.  -Rule # whatever. sing really loud to annoy the 65+ ...once they leave you will be the only ones there...just like a private show!   -RULE: Don't forget to tip!  *and don't forget to stop at the "gift shop" on your way out!!!

The best indian food i have found in the phx/tempe area.  Royal Taj is awesome. tandoori anything...GET IT! delicious naan try the special naan...soooo good! So much saffron!  The owners(I'm assuming) are sooo nice and always remember my friend when we come in. They also bring us on the house sticky balls for dessert usually (I think these are called galub jamen err...something)  One funny thing we always look for though is a poop stain on the wall in the womens restroom...it is ALWAYS there! makes me wonder about other things...but eh....BEST INDIAN FOOD IN TOWNZ!

Everytime somebody suggests we go to Time Out Lounge I want to send them to timeout...with a dunce cap on!!!!  this place is gross and now haunted.   as if the location isn't creepy enough (trashy strip mall on mill) and trust me, I am all into the dive-bar scene, this place takes the cake when it comes to nasty atmosphere.   The lighting is awful, and the bartender was a huge bitch once. I bet this place attracts the weirdest crowd. Including ICP/KottonmouthKing fans since it is next to Blaze, your average creeper 55+ pedophilic men,  and the poser hipsters taking a load off after their 6 hour shift as the manager of urban outfitters/american apparel.  *barf*  I'm giving it 2 stars, because they serve alcohol.

The best bar in Phoenix. The Bikini Girls have experience. I've had some of the best nights up in that bitch.   sexy.   and PBR is like so cheap. Don't be appalled when you see all the dudes drinking straight from a personal pitcher, its one less glass for the ladies to clean.  Also, JOHN MAYER!

if you're into bread that is chewy silvermine is the best. smoke out the driver and they will bring you brownies...but don't say you will and then forget to b/ you are too drunk. and try not to barter with bjs, b/ then they will not even come and pretend to not remember you when you call the next morning demanding your subs and brownies sans d-s'ing free of charge. lots of lesbians work here too..I'm assuming only the ones that are into chewy bread though..

was a fan until recently.  I got hit by a car and had to drag the bike that I  bought from them to the store to get repaired.. well the kid that helped me was just  a prick in my tubes. gee whiz, a real douche.   After all the money I have spent in that store, not to mention they kept my bike light after wrapping my handlebars one time.. no wonder every time I go in there there is absolutely no customers and tempe bicycle has a steady flow. This Schwinn is anything but a win- a real rip off. I hate this place now, and you should too.

Tops will leave ya' tipsy...  Greg the owner is quite the dear who truly appreciates  his customers-- however, some of his employees on the other hand could use a few  pointers in the customer service department.  fer real........ I'll go to Tops to support the owner and also  to laugh at the sweaty asshole that works there.

yo, bro, let's compare forearm tats and drink some New Castle. P.S. everyone saw you bif it on your fixie as you rolled up to the bike racks.  for real, most predictable crowd ever!!!!  I can talk mad shit on this place all night long, but when it comes down to it, I love it. The location lends to its patrons- alternative college students living in the only historic (PHX like) neighborhood in Tempe. Plus it is right next to HTC, so everyone is sure to be rocking the flyest of  -50 gauges. puke.  but.......the charm of casey's is in the cats. they are cool and roam around. Also, the best patio ever, and lots of room. Don't go inside unless you can't get a drink b/ your waitress forgot about you (which is most likely what happened). Or if you like old dudes 65+ eyefucking the shit outta you be my guest. Also, one night after I was there, the next morning someone had charged $2000+ on my credit card for an ad in New Times. shady......or recession? I think I know how this happened, they leave your card within an arms reach from the bar inside, face-up so any creeper with 20/20 can get a peek and thief you out of your identity and money, or maybe it was an inside job???  but I really like this place and still have "casey's nights" even though jimmy eat world sucks and I live in phoenix.   oh yeah, this place is haunted too....and if you are a girl do not go pee in the grotto.gross.

This place is realllly yummy.  If you like/are Rockabilly you will love this place.  If you have an affinity for girls/guys with tattoos/gauges you will enjoy this place  If you want thanksgiving dinner shoved into an unhealthy English version of a Pita Pocket you will DiiiiiiiiiEEEEEEEEEEE (Rachel Zoe ) this place.  I'm naut ruckabillie but I "dig" this place. It's really dark inside, and the food goes good with beer which they have much of.  There are really great/grotesquely intriguing pictures of coal miners on the walls too which are fun to look at while eating said pastys...not the nipple coverings.  TRY: the pasta salad..it ain't a pasty but holy-rockabilly-hell it is effin' good!

ah, the lost leaf.  I have a loving relationship with this place, even though I know exactly why some people hate it.   The best part about it is its' discreet nature....keeps the people away that need garish signage to point them in the right direction. Basically what I'm saying, is if you don't know where it's at, it probably ain't for you. BOOM. ROASTED!  also, one of the bartenders is really hot, but puts out such a dick vibe. Also all the other bartenders are a-holes. but who cares...I like this place, and I think it does a great job staying on and off the radar due to its simplicity. It is a haunt for the locals. Nothing ever changes there, except for maybe the hideous art.  oh, and the beers good too.  8% !!!!

This place blows like a con-air.  Everyone has an expensive stick up their ass ( that they bought on credit and now cannot afford to pay for), not to mention terrible personal style...why would I trust Ricky Martin with the white pants and Ed Hardy fedora to touch MY style? The only thing going for this etch-a-sketchy is the shampoo girl, she gotz long nailz...i mean fingerz.

Almost perfect! 4* b/ I always seem to spend like $20 here on one meal.  My favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix though.  I am 24/7 craving the soup with the cilantro and chicken in it...holy crap, the broth is amazing and it is colorless...but super flavorful. If you like cilantro you have to try it.  Also, I love the restaurant and how it looks like an ex-diner. I hate the fact that at a lot of the booths either you or your guest is forced to look at the atrocious glowing walking couple that is on the East side of the PHX art museum..it is so annoying..so disproportionate... too languid a pace...anyways..    Also, the best dream I have ever had (I know, I know, everyone hates dream stories including myself but this is good) is that I fell asleep inside thai hut during lunch, and they let me sleep..then to top it off sent me home with chicken fried rice..  this place rules!

They either serve Rainbow flavored pizza or that sticker means that you can have glitter as a topping!!!!!   HEEEEEEYYYY GIRL! PHX's 1st Gay friendly pizza parlor that ain't afraid to proclaim it-or to watch out for the monsoon! (whatever that means)...  Let's just say the pizza is fab-u-lous!  As far as the joint itself, I stuck my elbow somewhere into a pool of what I'm assuming to be ranch dressing???(I hope)  They just need some shade outside.....and it's right in the heart of crackwhore/head alley..aka my favorite stomping ground.   my new MAJOR place to score some ZA' besides Pizzeria Bianco's dumpster.

eh.  bad service.  One night my family and I went in about 40 mins until closing, and boy did they look UNHAPPY! Seriously though..40 mins til closing time and they couldn't muster up a semi-sincere greeting. Whatever.   I can't even remember the pizza.

Cannot get enough of this place!  -great location  -all the tables seem to have privacy, yet you still can see whats going on.  -the toilet paper is stamped with their logo (This means they got   somethin' good going on I'm sure)  -cheap during happy hour  -super cheap during happy hour ($5 pitchers everyday foo ' (I think between 11 and 5)  -Special $20 wine/bruschetta thingy.   -hot staff..except one guy yelled at me and my friend for smoking in the parking lot on our way to our bikes...whatevs.. we quit anyways!  -not too many douchey customers (that I've encountered)  -oh, and best hoegarden on tap i have ever tasted!  win winw inwinwinwinwinwinwi wiiiiin! Postinos...FTW!

Get the Michelada to drink. It truly is more than just a tecate in a glass, it has a spiced/salted rim with fresh squeezed lime juice and some other glorious  liquid in it that I am unsure of.   the small portions here are awesome, which makes this place perfect for late night drinks/snackiez.  also the guacamole for $7 is worth it-- it has fruit in it or something.  on the downside, shitty music, it's obvious that one of the wait staff has their mini ipod on shuffle or something, and the service kinda blows. Also, cheap decor, but really nice lighting.  I am really pretentious (obviously) but I like this place a lot.

I don't know whatcha'll complainin' about.. - this place totally delivered everything I was anticipating from a joint touting itself as 'modern tiki'  For CHRIST's SAKE GET THE SCORPION BOWL!  reeeeeeeeealllllly strong, enough to get you and your friend a wee bit more than snoggered. The drink doesn't taste very good, but that's not why you  buy it....you buy it for the kitsch and the 2 foot long hot pink straw you drink it with!  The food- was really good...I don't know what everyone is bitching about...they must have sand stuck in between their swimming suits and crabs. lame-os.   this place is fun...even more if you're wasted.

I'm just gonna do the damn thing and give this place 5 stars.... they seriously have the BEST coleslaw ever!!! I hate coleslaw and this stuff is really good. I love the cilantro in it and how it is not too saucy unlike myself.

since I cannot show my face in Gallo Blanco ever again, this has now become my fave gourmex establishment where they will trade food for $!  the tacos are good. the salsa is better. the only downfall, is NO ALCOHOL! ...which may be why I am still able to show my face in here...and perhaps why the hairspray is not sticky... NO ALCOHOL!

If you love all things furry, cutesy, quirky, creepy and fun this is definitely THE place.  I really wanna live in here and fulfill all of my childhood Candyland fantasies: Rendevous with a kooky rock man, be-friend the two-headed baby doll dragon, and eat multiple pieces of the multi-tiered pastel cakes and glittery mushrooms!  This is one of the most unique stores Phoenix has to offer, and of course it has the BEST location- right next to Bikini Lounge!   Another beautiful/fantastic thing is that Beatrice Moore the "Grand Dame" is the owner/shopkeeper crafter of the joint!   pom poms and pipe cleaners galore, you will definitely find a one of a kind super kooky kraft to cherish here or if you are in the market one of Moore's amazing paintings.  If you don't like this place, a big BOO to you. You're probably no fun, like, at all.

Should be called: miss/sub-par... maybe I'm being a little harsh.    The menu is snooze. They need a better beer selection ASAP!!!! $6 for a can of Guinness... that must be a guinness record for overly priced.  I knew the menu better than the waitress!  Um, welcome back?   2 stars for turning 905 into something slightly better, aka less pretentious.

In love with Jo....but he's part Bot....man vs machine....can I have both?  :/  The new space is mighty fine.  Delicious coffee! Delightful! Divine!  My favorite part is the new patio a go go! and the spare room for "chillin" with your iced-mocha with soy no whip extra shot double pumped caffeine feind shaken not stirred yes please and thank you!  So tute!   Also..the best part, it knows what it is:  unpretentious furnishings and VIBE. I like this place. I love my Bots.
