I really love korean food. I ordered a bunch of things last night. I had ordered a vegetarian soon tofu soup with everything in it (seaweed, mushrooms, and kimchee) and eveything else ordered was shared with my friend except the soup. Although my friend tasted the soup and thought it diddint taste fresh. Towards the end of dinner, around 9:15, I began to feel suddenly ill. I went to the bathroom and threw up violently and painfully. :( Went out, and went back to throw up. Struggled to walk out of there, I threw up multiple times on the way home. By midnight I was hyperventilating, in extreme pain everywhere, and could not walk. I called my friend who was just with me to take me to the emergency room. I considered calling an ambulence. :( I truly felt like I was going to die.  My friend found me on bathroom floor. Rushed me to hospital. In the hospital, I blacked out a few times, saw the light, as they rushed to attend to me. I couldn't talk, walk, or function. I had severe food poisoning.  I had chills, sweats, shakes, and feeling hot and cold. Absolute worst feeling in the world. They immediately gave me fluids, nausea meds, and morphine for pain. I was there untill 3:30. My feeling is that soup was bad. It diddnt taste right to begin with, nor did it look right. Also, considering it was a veggie broth, I wonder if because it may be something the Asians there NEVER order (perhaps), they probably had a batch that went wrong, or... maybe something else in the soup wasint right. Lastly, the soup is usually super boiling hot. I felt like it wasint, cause my egg diddint cook right away as usual. Maybe it was the egg from samonila poisening. I'm going to talk to the manager, I want a full refund.  This has been the most traumatic health issue I've ever felt, and certainly the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had. :(  Update: Sean the owner helped to get me a full refund. And I expressed that I would like to give this place another chance without getting sick. He also gave me a gift card for future use. Thank you Sean.

Amazing service, amazing food. What can I say?! Super yummy salad bowls... :) yay!! So glad they have vegetarian black beans!! As a vegetarian, being able to eat here is awesome and delicious!!! Not all Mexican places have 100% vegetarian beans. Often the beans have lard, so again, happy for chipotle!!!

Alrighty, this place is extremely legitimate. Large authentic Vietnamese menu, smiling faces for service, FAST SERVICE, EXCELLENT ON POINT CUISINE, and excellent excellent excellent pricing. Makes me wish this place was right next door! I would be coming more often. Probably every day or other day at that. The herbs were fresh and aplenty, and the condiment to-go station was well organized to do it yourself. Great dessert options for authentic Vietnamese choices. Apparently, my girlfriend tells me this area is Vietnamese-ville? I don't know, but the prices for great Vietnamese food in Tempe and Scottsdale is WAYYY more... and the menus in these cities I've found don't even touch the menu that is offered here. Here, its way more extensive. Two appetizers, and two main dishes was $21. There was take home too! OH YUMMM! BTW growing up being "Asian" myself, and eating authentic pho every week in China Town Honolulu makes me a good judge of good Vietnamese food... ;)

This place has been a huge and pleasant surprize. I pride myself in knowing what great asian food is, being I am half asian and I grew up on asian food every day, rice and kimchee lol!   This place has given me hope for asian restaurants that claim to be asian fusion. To me, they did it right. And even better!  This location offers EXTREMELY, perfectly executed AND authentic sushi, Vietnamese,  Thai AND Chinese dishes!!!! WHATT?!! :D  To top it off, the service is great, they offer many vegetarian dishes, AND ITS SO CUTE INSIDE! Prices are legit, and I couldint ask for anything more. So stoked that I found this place!!!

Best authentic vegan/American cuisine ever!!! I can't stop going for their Big Whack burger!!!! So bad, but SOOO GOOD!!! Thank you for existing Green!!! Super happy to have found ya! I have not tried the Asiany dishes yet cause I'm stuck on this sandwich. But having been to vegans places in LA, this one tops as one of the best!! Place could be a little cleaner as far as the tables being wiped, but other than that, no complaints! Staff is usually nice too. Open one in Fountain Hills!! Or some place close to that!! Haa haa...

I am happy to have found Ping's Cafe, it's right in my hood. Being vegetarian, there are a few dishes I usually order that are delicious... They have generous portions which is the amount any real Chinese restaurant should serve, and the owners are really sweet and accommodating. I can't find much tofu in Founatian Hills, but thank goodness they do!

I hate to give bad reviews. :(   I excitedly came here after careful research in AZ as to "Hawaiian food" and found this place. I am from Hawaii and am part korean. So my Hun and I excitedly came here with high hopes from reading the reviews and comparing to other places. We drove 35 min to get there. Upon arrival, the place reminded me of plate lunch places in Hawaii... Kinda hole in the wall ish. With Hawaiian stuff decorating the place. This place reminded me of a chain in Hawaii called "Yummys Korean BBQ", except not as clean, veggie portions not as big, nor did they have a veggie place option (5 larger portions of veggies and 2 scoops rice). :( Or a fried tofu option like Hawaii often has... :(  I proceeded to the counter excitedly explaining I was newly relocated and from Hawaii and that this was the first "Hawaiian" place I found online and was going to try. There was a lady that helped me that was completely rude, unfriendly, and did not care about what I just expressed. :( Just rude and wanting to hurry and take an order from me. With that said, I would never return back to such a rude place where no true aloha is being expressed from them. :( You would think a simple "hi" or "welcome!" back would have been great, especially because I happily greeted her with a smile and that I was from Hawaii excited to try their food!  But nada. Just rudeness, straight face, and no smile. Bummer. Not coming back. They need a veggie plate option, a website, and nicer servers who don't act like customers are bothering them.   I am one who highly values my interactions with others, especially when it comes to being served, and when a restaurant claims to have anything connected to Hawaii, I would hope to find some true aloha spirit there to keep me coming back for more. What a disappointment. :(

This place is a jem within Fountain Hills. With its lovely views of the lake when dining outside, and live music/ performance playing every so often, it makes this place such an romantic and joyous atmosphere to dine in. We loved the wonderful variety of foods that we tried being that flavors here in Fountain Hills seem to be bland and usually American, this place kicks it up a notch! Ethnic eats, and soulful atmosphere makes us want to return again and again. Service was always excellent.

The most beautiful yoga studio I have ever visited.  Being that this yoga studio is coming from SWIHA, its got all the SOUL connected to it.   I am so happy to have set my feet on this place. There is a beautiful pond next to it with fishes and duckies...  After enrolling at SWIHA, and took some classes here, I was so inspired to take the Yoga teachers training course. Thank you KC for your vision, and for making SOY happen, creating a army of lightworkers for this world!!!  Anyone who values health in body, mind, and spirit should not hesitate to take some classes here, you will be transformed!!!

I came in to see Rachel after a string of bad hair cuts since relocating here in Arizona, not knowing who to turn to. She did an amazing job, was very knowledgeable, and even offered some tips to style my hair. I was very happy to have her listen to what I wanted, and then be able to execute my vision properly. I had very long hair with layers that were ruined from other stylists, but she fixed it up!! She was a joy to talk to, as we discussed healthy lifestyle topics, yoga, and life. I am glad I found someone I can trust, and someone I can get along with as well. I look forward to future cuts with her!!

Pretty good. I just wish there were more tofu or vegetarian options listed. :(  A dish that stood out the most was the salt and pepper tofu. It's listed on the appetizer menu, and it was super tasty! Next time I would get that as part of my main dish, and order some stir fried veggies to go with that or something.   Being that I'm used to getting Chinese food in Los Angeles that is pretty damn good and a lot cheaper, I'm spoiled with that.  Nonetheless, I guess living in Fountain Hills does not give you the option to eat like in LA of course. I am grateful this place exists. Service was good.  They have pad thai on the menu which was interesting. This neighborhood could sure use a purely Thai cuisine restaurant instead. If they are going to mix up the types of Asian foods there, you might as well throw in some. Korean or Vietnamese while your at it and make everyone happy since you can't find these foods in Fountain hills.

It was... OK. I would give it 1 star had it not been for the excellent customer service and nice atmosphere. Food was so so. Not authentic asian. I was happy with the large portion of noodles, but the veggies and tofu was lacking, same with the sauce. It seemed there was no sauce. And it was supposedly a spicy option. :(  So over all, judging the food, I was disappointed. Also I ordered spring rolls to go with my order, and for $15 bucks, I get plain noodles and super basic spring rolls that were over priced. I'd rather just go to a real Thai/Vietnamese place. Sorry. I'm over the Caucasian catered Asian restaurants in this area. I want some real Asian food, with more veggie options as I'm used to getting in Los Angeles and Hawaii.

I was soo damn excited to try this place, being really close by, and being raised on authentic Chinese/Hong Kong hot pot in LA and HI. I read all the reviews, got excited, and went. :( I hate to give low scores, but this is based off of my total experince. They get one less star because of lack of correct business information posted here as far as business hours, and BBQ hours. They also seriously need a website. This is an aweful business practice, and they could be making some serious improvements. Businesses need to be on top of these basic and fundamental things!! Wth?  Well, fist off, on yelp, it says they are open at 11am. Nope. When I arrived excitedly, sign says 5-2am. Ok. No prob. Ill come back!  Next day I go back, yayyy! Upon entering, I am bombarded by loud and obnoxious techno that keeps reapeating itself. Other than that, the decor was cute, and as everyone described here. The techno music put me on edge lol. I could not relax to enjoy my experience. With a few tables filled, did the music need to be so loud?  On to the menu and service...  We had originally come to try this famous rice ball everyones been talking about, and possibly get some little vegetarian BBQ sides, similar to yakitori. When I mentioned the word "yakitori", the waitress dressed in Japanese garb was like "what u say?"... ok right, this is Chinese owned Chinese/Hong Kong restaurant... she was nice. She priceeds to tell me that the BBQ menu is only avail Thurs - Sat. What!? You guys seriously need to update your yelp info!! I already missed eating here once cause your hours are posted wrong, and now I sat there unable to try what I came here for?! :(  In my observation service was not very efficient or quick. Service was slow as I observed in general. It was not busy, so I couldint understand why our server was not more attendant.  We had ordered a sake bomb to share, and no second cup was brought out... had to ask.  The food itself was great. I always order vegetarian things, so I was happy there were an item here and there was. I had a terrific eggplant dish that itself deserves 5 stars. We also shared the tomato vegetarian hot pot. Lighter in flavor than others I've had in my life, it was still yummy. It said there was supposed to be lotus root in there. When I told my server there was none, she was like "oh really? Sorry." Nothing to correct the situation. We shared it. Its made for one. And it comes with a choice of two dipping sauces... they sucked. See in LA, you get all these sauces at the table for FREE and they are authentic and damn good. I could tell they Americanized the dipping sauces here. :(  Over all, slightly dissaponted. And just wish AZ had a really bomb and authentic hot pot experience. Hong Kong hot pot that im used to feeds four cause the pots so damn huge, and its like $15-$20. For one pot here its $10 +. :(  We were finished with our meal for a good 10 min, and began to gather our things before she noticed to give us our check. Where did our free ice cream go that everyone was raving about? We did not get any. :(  I see where everyones been confused about this place. Its Japanese decored, but Hong Kong style food. Maybe they should consider changing the theme to stop the confusion lol.  I will give it a try again, just to get my asian food fix nearby. But I hope for better dining experiences.

*UPDATE: I got sick from the tacos and it was a crappy experience all last light - literally. :( I feel like my body was hit by a freight train, and still does this morning. Had to call out of work, and I had chills in my body all night including pain. Wow. Never going there again. They need to step up their game.  So I really love Senor Taco, but this location was a miss for this first visit. I've been to two other more popular and busy locations across Phoenix that open till 2 am and the food there was much more noticeably fresher than this location, including the salsa bars. I don't blame them, from what I understand this location tends to be slower, and it was towards the end of their night shift - 10 pm. I was super excited to share my favorite "taco" place, but was disappointed by the fish being dry, along with the corn tortillas. The salsa bar here I could tell by the end of the night had been sitting there for a long while, being dry along the edges. Nonetheless, it was still "good". Just not the killer good I am used to at the other locations. I feel bad for this location, as it has potential. I also learned a bad taco place used to be here before they took ownership, so maybe that affected the business - from others who remember the old place and prefer not to give this new place a try? I don't know. I look forward to eating at the other locations in which I had always been blown away by each and every time. I was hoping tonight would have been one of those times. Not sure if I will try this location again. It was rather small compared to the other ones I've been to also. Portions seemed the same by the way. Just not as noticeably fresh. For such a great price, I suppose I can't complain.

If your looking for a mom and pop authentic Vietnamese restaurant thats served with a smile.... this is your place. They happen to have an extended restaurant next door that offers vegan Thai/Vietnamese food, yet they will serve it to you on the pho side. :) Service has always been consistently friendly, atmosphere never crazy, so I like that.I love thier vegan pho, and also tofu rolls. Its in my hood and I'm grateful.
