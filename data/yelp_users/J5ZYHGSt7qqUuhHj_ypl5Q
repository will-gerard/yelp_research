I was referred to this company by my wedding venue which only allows a handful of caters to work at their establishment. The first tasting went very well, when I emailed asking for specific items and made a second appointment that is when I was called an "over zealous bride." That the tasting was just to give confidence in his skills and that he would not be doing 15 tastings for one bride and that there are 10,000 other caters in AZ and to pick one of them. The lack of professionalism was honestly astounding. It has been the worst experience of planning my wedding and took me completely off guard as the flip from nice to disgustingly rude was instantaneous.

I adopted a companion for my 6 year old pit mix from a local shelter. She had food issues, and was terribly insecure. I found puppy training and socialization classes with Wendy and it was unequivocally the best decision I ever made! Every week they both go to doggy day care and love it!

Amazing pizza, possibly the best I have ever had. The sauce is unique almost sweet and the fresh dough it light and tasty.

As an apartment complex manager I had been used a previous company for warranty work and would wait and wait and wait. Once the warranty expired I changed companies and couldn't be happier. Not only am I scheduled quickly, in most situations Justin is able to get the needed parts quickly and I no longer wait weeks for a solution.    I will never use anyone else for our appliance repair needs!
