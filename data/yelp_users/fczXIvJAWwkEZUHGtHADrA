just another day of going in here, except this time after i picked out the The Blu-Ray i wanted (a 2010 remake of an old 1982 film) i went and waited in a long ass line for a long ass time and after receiving my Blu-ray at the door i walked out to my car, had a feeling something wasn't right so i checked the disc, and I'll be damned, the dumb cashier gave me the 1982 (remastered bluray) version, after walking back inside i looked at the cashier who swapped the bluray i returned out for the new one, he looked at me and instantly headed for the back of the store. so i got in line (and was next in line) but between the two other cashiers who were slow (mentally and physically) i waited for a loooong time and when i got to the counter i told the lady he gave me the wrong disc and she sat there dumbfounded as to how to swap the disc out, she went and got a manger who told her to do it like any other exchange, and then after having all this time wasted she proceeded to tell me there was a sale on batteries tomorrow (Christmas day) if i come in and buy something... after wasting more of my time and the other 40 people in line she finally forked over my bluray and i was on my way.

This Location is closest to me being less than a mile away from my home, but my past experiences has me driving 4 miles to tatum and bell for the 24 Hour location (also because of their amazing service and good food) every time i have been to this location it has been a bad experience especially with employees who have terrible accents and are very hard to understand in-person or through the drive-thru window which gets very frustrating on my end and on there end which has even led to one of the employees talking to me like i was a baby which i was very unhappy about plus with the drive-thru window the service inside and out is slow as hell, and as for the food, it's always wilted and looks as though its been sitting out for awhile without being changed. as for the drive-thru, the audio quality at the crappy looking menuboard is awful, almost impossible to communicate through causing confusion, and frustration amongst the customer and the employees  pros: it's subway, close to my house  Cons: Service quality is bad, and the employees are hard to understand and are extremely impatient as well as unfriendly, the drive-thru audio quality is impossible to communicate through. food is gross looking, and taste is not far behind.   conclusion: i would definitely not recommend this location to a friend but if you absolutely had no choice i guess you could always put up with the crap the employees dish out in-store and in the drive-thru

been here a few times since its been FedEx office, once to use the "office" to print something because i was out of ink at home,another to ship a $130 headset (which was THROWN into my gated yard and nearly damaged upon receiving via FedEx that i'm not counting in this review) and another to fax an important document. when i went here to print via the computers available for public use via a reloadable store card the employee who loaded the card and got me started made me feel like i was stupid for not knowing how to insert the card and get their old windows 2000 fired up for use and printing! the overall staff and service quality is OK, never really crowded but the staff is rather slow on a good day, the prices are rather pricy but not too bad, this location is just a few miles from my house so it's pretty convenient if i need to ship something. if you need something shipped or faxed ( i would say printed to but i went here instead of the mesquite library near PV Mall because i was heading to blockbuster down the street, however the library doesn't charge to use their pc's and printing is cheap there) I would definitely recommend this location to a friend (as a matter of fact i actually have when somebody i knew needed to ship something in a hurry and wasn't sure where to go)

Pros: It's McDonald's. the food here is OK, and the location is convenient to my house.  Cons: slow service, long lines, and have had to pull around several times because of messed up orders. the actual customer service is terrible here. no more ice, especially on a day like the 4th of July. friendly, NO!.   never been inside this McDonalds location, only in the corner store, which is a different story! I guess convenience come with a price, not physically but verbally!

I have been here several times and I love the style of the establishment as well as the fast (as in getting in a chair fast, but unlike most conventional haircutting places they take there time to make sure its flawless), friendly, and affordable service.  After the first haircut i got, i no longer go to great clips and sports clips and i would recommend any man to go here and get there hair cut too!

whenever I go to Wal-mart this is usually my first choice although it is 4 miles from my house, however that could soon change considering they are converting this store into a super-center. the service is alright here, never had any problems. I have been coming to this location with my family for many years, I was also in a fox special report they did here in 1999 (youtube it!) its great their is also a built-in Subway even though I still go to the one at the end of the lot by Dunkin' Donuts. since they have started remodeling it has been confusing to locate specific items in the store but I'm sure they will get it sorted out once they finish. other than that, no major complaints like some of the other stereotypical Wal-marts in Phx.

so i went through the drive-thru today, and upon ordering 3 burgers and two with just ketchup and cheese, the "Se hablo espanol" working the mic kept ringing them up as "ketchup/no mustard" and repeated it back like 3 times,  after saying she didn't know how to get the order right because they got a new system (NOT MY PROBLEM!) doesn't give them an excuse to mess up my order! anyway we also ordered a "caramel apple sundae" the muchacha even repeated it back as "caramel apple sundae" then rang it up as a "hot fudge sundae" (not what i ordered!) then upon getting to the window they hand me a hot fudge sundae, after telling them about it, they go and get a caramel apple sundae with maybe an inch of ice cream and light caramel drizzle. at other McDonald's i get about 2-3x as much!!! i guess i wont be going back to this one for a while (at least until the estupido learns the "new system")

Pros: Great Donuts and hot chocolate, Great Service,  Friendly most of the time, Open early, Convenient location, great prices, cleanliness - for the most part, OK Customer service.  Cons: in the past I have seen flies - buzzing around the donuts, and they close to early in the day, when I'm out in the afternoon or late at night i am forced to take my business elsewhere - usually a convenient store with suckish donuts.  when I start achin' for a donut, this establishment is usually my first choice.

I have been here many time in the last few years since the JitB at cave creek and cactus turned into filiberto's. the only reason i even come to this one instead of the one at 32nd & cactus which is just as far from my current house is the food quality is better here, i have never really had a 'good' experience here but it's sorta what to expect. but several times in the past, yesterday and now today they have told me to stop and wait after the car ahead of me leaves so they can "fix their time/clocks" I always got frustrated because of this but today it almost got domestic in the parking lot after the cars behind me started honking their horns, i yelled at the DB directly behind me that i was instructed not to pull up, after the employee "Julia" came to the window and told us just to pull up, i demanded an explanation, and to speak to the manager, but she said said there was no explanation and hesitated to say the managers name, instead she just kept saying "he is working the back and can't talk now" so i kept demanding until she said it. it was a terrible experience and i don't see myself returning here for a very long time.

I personally have been there many times and after having my pre-order info messed up twice by amber who looks really unprofessional with hair that's usually two different colors, as well as the other workers who lie on the phone about price and inventory info making me have to go to the PV mall to find a certain game at that Gamestop, although their customer service on returning recently purchased used games is good, the HUGE, disorderly lines every time there is a new midnight release makes me not want to pre-order here ever again. All-in-all i wouldn't recommend anyone to make a "GAMESTOP"  here unless they absolutely have to.

This place is roughly 4mi from my house so it's not convenient, and it is right across the street from 24hr subway so I don't go here often enough when I'm over here for late night food, but I love their cheap tacos and their 99cent churros. Never had a problem as far as customer service goes, the staff is friendly unlike most McDonald's and Jack in the boxes. Would recommend somebody to go here for cheap mexican food, I actually prefer their cheap tacos to Taco Bell's 89cent tacos

i used to not be a very big fan of Subway in-general, but ever since the $2 cold cut combo and meatballs subs in December i have come to love their subs, but the thing is, i have been to several other subway restaurants in phoenix/Scottsdale and the experiences were sorta bad (and I'll get to them in their own review), but of the 10 times i have been to this particular location i have had no issues other than it being 4 miles away from my house  Pros: Fast, Friendly service, open 24/7, fresh ingredients, food tastes great  Cons: other than the location inconvenience, none whatsoever  Conclusion: If you like great tasting subs for a great price i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, and also if you have a bad experience at another location don't blame them all, because their are good locations such as this one!

My Family has stopped here and picked up Pizza Before and they've never really complained, so after seeing the commercial about the $10 dinner box I decided to get one of them here, upon arriving I got out of my car and smelled a horrible odor which I Figured was coming from one of the tire shops on either side (Fat Boys/Discount Tire) but upon entering the building the smell actually worsened, it smelled like stinky feet, as for the actual customer service - I have experienced much better. after sitting down and putting up with the odor, the manager (i guess) and what appeared to be other workers started lecturing another employee on how to be a better employee (the way they were talking it sounded like they were once military instructors) very disturbing even for just waiting for my order, what if i was in here having dinner with my family or something, I surely would not want to hear a lecture while I was trying to enjoy my food. upon leaving there was several employees outside texting in the reasonably small parking lot

This is the worst McDonalds i have ever been to. (period)  Actually I go there quite often, and every time I have been there the food always has dries up particle of mustard ketchup and other food items. I don't think i have ever been inside this restaurant and I'm 99.9% sure i never want to.  I went through the drive thru and some "estúpido extranjeros ilegales" were deliberately switching mics and speaking Spanish then switching back and laughing while trying to take the order.

Been here handful of times over the past few years have only had minor issues (putting veggies in a dish specified with "no vegetables") other than that, the food is delicious and you pretty much get what you pay for, the food is kinda pricy but you get pretty big proportions. service is friendly enough, you can also call in your order if you wanna pick up your order when you get their or are in a hurry. the actually eating area of the store looks clean but when i glanced over the counter in the back it looked awful, (food splatters, water all over the floor) but im no health inspector and it was before closing.   also, the teriyaki chicken is AWESOME with white rice!   Conclusion, if you have enough cash and want some good chinese food definitely go here to get it!

I went here and ordered a hamburger about two minutes til closing, and sure enough i was in the ER with severe stomach pains by 3 AM. I am about 99% sure that is what caused it but due to the inability to give a stool sample within the first few hours the doctors were unable to absolutely say it was their fault... Plus the wait times are horrible even for expensive food and a small menu to go along with the terrible service.  I would recommend anybody who wants to get a hamburger late at night, to go elsewhere unless you want to run the risk of severe stomach pains and nausea!

great place for men, their is a small TV for you to watch while having your haircut and a big one to watch while waiting, the service is great, wait times and price not so much but for all the old men who are always in their that just want to be mauled by younger women i guess its OK. I would recommend men to get their hair cut here if they are willing to pay extra just to associate with the young women and get a haircut no better than some average establishment such as great clips.

Pros: its QT. Great prices as all locations, fast/friendly service, clean. convenient location.  Cons: Fountain drink/frozen coffee machines usually neglected or being serviced most of the times I have been there. They are constantly mopping whether you're standing there or not. And one time they even started dusting the lids and counters while I was standing there with a lidless drink.

i went here again recently and the floor was wet, the worker was reaching past some young Hispanic kids to fill his small cup while they were busy having there cups filled by their parents/grandparents and several of the ice dispensers were not in service and the frozen coffee was all watery.

went here again today, expecting to get a hot chocolate with whipped cream for my sis and a few drinks for the other fam members and just like the last time i went in here (about a week ago) the whipped cream machine was down still, i made mention of it infront of an employee and she said the mechanic who fixes it has been there every night but still wont fix it, not my problem. i expect to go in there and actually be able to get it, obviously not the case here. after gettin the chocolate i went for the fountain drinks, and several of them were out too. luckily they had the kinds i needed to get, after getting them i went to put them in a carrier so they would be easy  to carry in the car but as i opened them they split apart way too easy. very disappointing, but its just something about this location.... i have never had any good experience when in this store.

AWFUL. not just this location but COX in-general. Their service is awful, I have had their service for many years and have had TONS of problems with the cable, internet, and phone. after being scammed on the phone garbage I have had cable/internet bundle. and many years of stressful internet outages, torturous setups, bad service at the stores, glitchy poor quality tv service, and grouchy, incompetent technicians that take three days to come out to your house to fix any problems you have... and as far as other services go they are very overpriced. when i first hooked up my HDTV almost the first thing i did was trade in my SD DVR  (which i had to return about 4 times for hardware failures) for an HD one. got it home plugged it in and THE QUALITY IS AWFUL. (HDMI and Component which is downright lying when their commercials make their HD sound flawless) also the only channel I actually care about watching is discovery.... AND I CAN'T WATCH IT BECAUSE IT PIXELATES AND THE AUDIO GLITCHES! its WRONG!!!! for a long long time I was paying for 12Mbps - 15Mbps internet and I was getting a maximum of 8Mbps in the day time, after calling 'em up and replacing my modem and router with a very high-end gateway the problem still persisted so they ended up telling me the problem was the connection being split with two TVs plus anyone else in the neighborhood who was running the same line as me.... (BS!) someone im related to is a friend of someone who is higher up on the food chain at COX and he said that it shouldn't matter how many times its being split especially living in a neighborhood that supports up to 20Mbps. in fact when we moved in we called COX to send a technician out to the house to install there cable lines in the house, after them being at our new house for 2 hours ALONE and leaving, absolutely nothing was changed.... what in god's name did they do for TWO HOURS!.... oh and they installed a set of cable and phone jacks in the upstairs bedroom and not two months afterward the phone jack fell apart (inside and out) and left a gaping hole in the wall and refused to fix it. that's just a few of the countless problems I have had with them, I know you're probably thinking JUST CHANGE, but I'm technically not the one in charge of being able to do that or you know i would, If i haven't given you enough proof not to let them rip you of your hard earned cash, hit me up, i have plenty of more examples if you absolutely need them. now as for this store, its bad as well. the service is slow and there was a colored man working at the old Bell rd. location who, when i traded in SD receivers for SD DVRs, gave me an outdated DVR that gets terrible quality service and is incompatible with newer DVR updates. who still works at this location, he is downright rude and goes as far as having no general compassion for the customer as long as he makes a sale. the location itself is inconveniently located but does offer free WiFi at a speed faster than i pay dearly for which really doesnt matter as there is a starbucks right across the street that also offers WiFi Bottom line: I WOULD SUGGEST PASSING UP COX IF YOU VALUE YOUR DOLLAR AND HAVE THE CHOICE. TAKE ME AS AN EXAMPLE.

Went here on 1/2/12 to find out they were taking a 3-day weekend, so i came back today. THE PLACE WAS PACKED full of people wanting to return/exchange receivers as i was because i got fed up with not having the service being functional. the only good things that actually came out of this 45 minute wait was getting a brand-new cisco receiver, which still didnt fix anything. called em up, and they refreshed the signal which helped for about 5 minutes before screwing up some more. now i have a scheduled technician visit tomorrow....it'll probably  either a crotchidy old man, or a younger man telling me to quit complaining because there are less fortunate people who dont have cable even though i'm paying dearly for my services. once again, i am VERY disappointed with cox communications. Wish me luck on the appointment!  --UPDATE--  the Cox Tech (a stocky redheaded guy) finally got here an hour late, and comes in with a hell of an attitude, acting like he knew everything and the problem was my fault, blaming the receiver not cox as well as being told on the phone that he would bring cords and a ladder, upon getting here he said if it needed a new cord that i would have to schedule another time because he was on a schedule that didnt include that. after all this bullcrap and proving the box was not entirely the problem, he changed the head of one of the cords connected to my HD DVR it fixed the problem slightly. so he went and changed the receiver and blamed the receiver for being glitchy, new and giving off too much noise in the signal he finally got it working good enough he ran on out to his truck, started to leave and i realised he left one of the other tv's and the modem still unplugged. so i called him back in and upon repairing he growls and says " god, im soo stupid, i left the other things unplugged.   i bet by now you think we probably just come in and fix one thing by breaking another, well thats not how we work."..... pfffftt could've fooled me, upon fixing this issue he runs back out to his truck and takes off, and after getting a complaint from the watchers of two of the other tv's i call him back again and he came back in and fixed them.  also forgot to add, the third time he came in he blundered through my house knocking things down, including a once-expensive camcorder. but being the nice person i am, im going to overlook it.  he also said the new cisco Explorer 8642HDC (that cox is giving EVERYBODY) he said there is a well-known widescale issue with the recording and playback, and that there should be a fix within a week. sounds great, cox giving out a box that THEY KNOW is broken. once again, i am very displeased with their service, customer service, and technicians. and i would most certainly not recommend cox to anyone.

I Realize this place has only been open for two days now, so I can't say for Sure, but the employees stocking items seem very unprofessional, rude, and lost...yes, lost. what i mean when i say this is that, no matter where in the store I was there was either a worker pushing me from behind with a dolly or a group of workers standing around trying to figure out what's next. while they were unloading boxes from palettes they would just stack the boxes up at the end of the aisles completely blocking off the aisles and would get bent out of shape if you, god forbid, tried to get past them.     I understand they're also saving you maybe 1-5 cents on a limited number of items compared to Wal-mart's big selection of rather low prices. I'm not really sure what "Employee Owned" means, but according to the "Employee" on Channel 3's news yesterday I'm guessing that means they can slack off as often as they want and treat customers any way they want without consequence.      all the aisles in the store are horribly unorganized, not like items out of place, but aisles out of place. for example, in the "meat" Section there is just different kinds of the same meats scattered about, not really a big deal, as i see they are trying to confuse people so people see more irrelevant items and try to pass them off as low-priced with propaganda to make people buy more.      as far as the design in the store, i have seen more color and excitement at a morgue. The walls are simple white with a blue stripe, the roof is just bare rafters and the floor is just polished concrete which is very unappealing.       now, I'm not so sure as I am not nor is anyone i know handicapped, but this place does not cater to handicaps in the slightest bit, being unsure on the matter but a long time ago wal-mart used to be like this, such as not letting handicap carts out the door, but over the years they lightened up as i see more and more carts in the parking lot there, LoseCo on the other hand has tall metal poles welded to the fronts of the handicap carts to prevent them from making it out the door as they would have to hire somebody to fetch them, also the poles are very distracting for customers, can't even imagine how distracting it is for the people who actually ride them.      as for the noise level in this place, i felt like i was visiting a factory, in one section there was a phone ringing off the hook over the loudspeaker and in another section there was a guy driving a scissor lift up-and-down aisles which caused a constant loud beeping noise.       upon checking out I quickly learned that they save you the few cents is by not hiring baggers. (let me get this straight, they are trying to make jobs for Arizonans, yet they don't have baggers... many of my friends who are also young-adults and looking jobs like that but no, they put the customer to work by making them do it thereself) If I wanted to be a bagger, I would.      on the plus side....... oh wait, sorry, there isn't one  I'm not the kind to be so quick to judge but this place was awful, I will update this review if i ever go there again, but I honestly doubt I ever will. If only their opening really was an Apil Fools Joke, I have never been so disappointed in my life!

So I went back here again, I can't say i Like the place any better, some food is dirt cheap but some other foods are twice as expensive to make up for it, The Cashiers are too old to be doing a job that should be done fast and efficiently, the checkout lines as well as the deli are still rather long, Being in here to buy something in-particular with the "Low-Price" in mind just to find out they don't carry it, was rather disappointing. I will go back, as absolutely needed but this will definitely not be my store of choice.
