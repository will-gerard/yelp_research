This is my second time renting from Steve and Melissa. I am glad I have picked them both times for my kids party because they value a clean, presentable bouncer. I know that I can rent anytime from them and get the same quality I expect. Prices are inline with what I expected and they have plenty of things to add to the party experience! The choices for theme are almost endless and they have water slides for the 8 months of the year it's hot!   Don't look back and order from Dreamland with confidence. You will not be disappointed! I haven't been yet.

This place was amazing. Almost got scared away by the area and look of the restaurant, but glad I wasn't. It sure was a pleasant surprise. The Tacos Al Pastor were the best thing on the menu and at $1 a piece you can get a few.

So I plan on going to Ted's today, checked the hours on their website (9am-8pm). Sweet. I show up at 3pm. They are closed. Nothing on the website about them being closed on a Saturday. I walk in and there's people all over the store, including the "help" that's cleaning the "lead" from the range. They are all wearing work clothes and jumpsuits and... Flip Flops? Makes no sense to me. Anyway, I go to the front desk and they tell me the range is closed. I asked, "On a Saturday?" The lady at the desk tells me, "Ya, we are cleaning the range. Was supposed to be done last night, but they went home early." Alright, your cleaning your range. On a Saturday. Unannounced. And you tell me there is nothing you can do about it? You can't give me an hour of range time for my inconvenience? I drive up from Florence to visit your range during business hours and your front line people don't see fit to give me or any one of the other people that showed up something for their trouble. It's not us that came when you were closed, it's you who were closed when you said you were open.   Next time I'll just go straight to Caswells and not deal with the lack of customer service at Ted's.

Called up Southwestern needing a windshield replacement and was pleasantly surprised. They can to me, on time and replaced it within a half hour of arrival. Jordan, the install tech, was friendly, knowledgeable and explained the process to me as he did it. Next time I need a windshield replaced, I will be calling them again!
