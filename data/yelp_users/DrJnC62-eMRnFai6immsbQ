Went to Cooperstown for lunch today. It was amazing!!! The Big Unit was huge and I had the whole works on it. I'm really not a big fan of sauerkraut, tomatoes, and onions but I went for it cuz it had bacon...and you know...bacon makes everything better. =o) The Big Unit is 22 inches long that was covered with chili, bacon, cheese, onions, tomatoes, sauerkraut, and relish. Hmmm...maybe I left off some toppings and it came with side of fries. This is definitely a meal that you can share with someone. It's just under 20 bucks. Oh...when they come out to serve the food the bell rings and they scream "BIG UNIT!!!"   By the way...please remember to bring quarters when you come to this place. A minute away from the place we realized we forgot to check if we had quarters. Luckily, I had quarters otherwise we would have had to detour for some quarters.   The service was great and quick. The place was clean and the staff was friendly.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!  Ever since I discovered Oregano's I've never been back to Olive Garden. I think their food is fantastic and I've learned to try other things aside from their meatballs...ummm! Service is always, always, always fantastic! The servers are so helpful and friendly. I have nothing bad to say about this place. If you do come here...be sure to explore the menu.  One bad thing, but I can't knock a star off for it, is that the wait can be extremely long especially during lunch hours. I've waited an hour before and at other times, I've gotten lucky to get the last table available.   Check out the pictures!

Went in this morning and I was on my phone so I didn't get greeted, but I thought I would when I hung up the phone since I was the only one there, but no...I decided to greet her instead. No smile on her face...how disappointing. Moving on to the pastries...  I ordered a strawberry, cream cheese, and blueberry danishes. I'm still trying to finish the strawberry one. All 3 cost 5.30 which I don't think is too bad. It's a good size portion and just enough balance to be sweet, but not too sweet. I thought the fillings were great and the cream cheese itself. Overall, it started my morning pretty great! (They just have to work on their greetings.)

I'm not much of a fan for this place. I like the idea of eating at buffets and not getting up to get your food, but the food here is just not up to par with me. I didn't even get another plate after my first; however, I found myself just eating all the sweet stuff. =T Sugar makes things better, right? LoL! I do like one thing from this place (but it's not enough to make me want to come back here again) and that's their sopaipillas; however, I feel like it used to be better before because they actually put stuff on it, but when I came here, they served it plain. I had to drench it with chocolate syrup.  I was really surprised that it cost about $20 for two people with drinks included...I know I can spend my $20 else where and be satisfied completely. Sorry...

OMG!!! This place is amazing! It was my first time here and I just loved the food. It is a little pricey, but not too bad for what you get. My coworkers and I started off with the salmon and artichoke. I tried artichoke before, but I was not a fan so I was a little hesitant to try it again, but I am so glad I did. Their artichoke was so good and the salmon was even better. MMMMMM...goodness! Then I had the Hawaiian Rib-eye with Fries. My meal was wonderful and I practically ate it all. My boss had the Barbecue Pork Ribs and the meat was like falling off the bones. It was ultra good!

Someone told me about this place and their all you can eat spaghetti. They also mentioned that they have great meatballs...so I had to check it out myself.  The first thing that bothered me was the noise level...it's like all the conversations going on in this place remained within the walls. However, the staff was very friendly and the service was good.  I had the Artichoke, Shrimp & Crab Dip which was good, but I wish it had more chucks of crab. I obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which I thought was good, but not  the best I've had. The sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that "wow" factor, but it was good (just not the best). I had also ordered a customize Calzone and that was without a doubt fabulous! The size and flavor were definitely in the "wow" factor. This helped to push the rating to a 4 star plus the service.

Went in this morning for breakfast. They had omelets that are cooked to order, waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage, biscuits, cinnamon rolls, cereal bar, milk, juices, and the whole works. There was a huge variety of food and totally awesome for only $4.99; however, drinks were extra like a buck something...definitely still worth it all.  On Sundays it goes from breakfast to dinner at 11am so I got the best of both worlds. Soon the fried chicken, Alfredo pasta, fish, mashed potatoes, pilaf rice, etc all came out.   Most unique thing is the grilling section. They served steak cooked to your liking, BBQ ribs, carved turkey and ham. They also have a seasoning section with their own steak sauce, A1, hot sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic salt, and all kinds.   I know I probably missed to mention a few things, but there's just too many to write it all down.  It was extremely busy when I arrived, but I got seated fairly quickly. Service was great! Workers were friendly and delightful. I would definitely come back...personally I think this beats Hometown even though their from the same family.

#1 - MUST have their garlic dipping sauce...so good!  I like that they have really cheap appetizers...I ordered all the $1.00 ones. I figured I might as well try them since they're cheap and see if I like them. I liked the Falafel, Spanakopita, and their bread (so good).   The food is pretty good and the portion is perfect (okay, maybe it's just a tad bit more than enough).   The workers are super friendly!

Wow! This place looks great inside, but the food is just do good! I had lunch here and ordered a Gyro Picado Pita which had strips of gyro, grilled green peppers, onions, and jalapenos with a side of Greek soup. The soup itself is wonderful and I could just have their soup alone. The gyro is yummy!!! You've got to come a little early to beat the lunch crowd.

Went here for the first time yesterday and it was great! I love fried chicken and theirs is really great especially if you add on the Louisiana hot sauce...ummm! Shared a KK's which consisted of 3 pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and scrambled eggs with cheese and onions. The waffles were tasty. The eggs were just alright. Then I had some grits for the first time and my friend said you really gotta add some salt and sugar to make it awesome...and that is exactly how you do it! The portions are pretty decent for its price. The service was great...the workers always came by to check on us.

Decided to be adventurous and try a new place. BINGO! The first thing that caught my eyes from the street was that they had pictures of food posted on their wall. I think pictures always helps out. They were closing in 30 minutes, but they were still very friendly upon greeting me. I ordered quite a few items: Hot Wings, Shrimp Fried Rice with Garlic, Krispy Noodle Chow Mein, Beef with Broccoli, Scallops and Shrimp with Garlic Sauce, and Lim's Special Chicken. For whatever reason I told them that it was my first time here and they had given me a discount on my order. On top of that, they also gave free drinks while I waited for my food. I didn't want to take the drink cuz I felt somewhat bad, but she had insisted. What a GREAT person! The food arrived in like 15 minutes and I guess I ordered a little bit too much. LoL! The food was packed nicely and in a box...must have been a few pounds. They even provided some sauce and the essentials of soy sauce and fortune cookies. Arrived home and I was just hungry and began eating. I should have taken some pictures, but I was starving. The food was great and I am going back again!

It's been awhile since I've been here and I almost forgot how great of a place this is. I ordered a few things, but one of the new items I tried was the Shrimp with Cream Sauce...ohh emm gee! Amazing sauce!!! I asked what kind of veggies it came with: mushrooms, snow peas, celery, carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. I'm not too big on some of the veggies, but the whole thing just went well together. Please try if you haven't...it's so GOOD!

I've been here a few times and I love Love LOVE their karaoke! I love how the waiters sing...they have such great voices! The place is loaded with several televisions to watch all your sports. Not only is this place great for entertainment, but the food is great too! The pizza and wings ftw!

I'm a big fan; however, I've noticed that the food has not been as great and service has slowed down.  Tonight, I called my order in at 6:48 and said my food would be ready in 10 minutes. I know they don't usually have it ready on the dot so I arrived at 7. I paid and then waited for #311. I watched people order their food for dine in and take out. I was so puzzled by the person who ordered their family meal like 10-15 minutes after I've been waiting and they got their order first - please explain Ono. They got all the orders up to #328 and then my #311 order was ready.  To make things worst, the Kalbi had a lack of taste. Why oh why? Why do you have to do this to my favorite food? The beef was a smaller amount than the usual.  I was totally disappointed. I don't know if I'll give them another chance or find an alternative. Please review this location and make things better.

One thing I like about this place...are the cacti! There are just everywhere! This is a great place to go camping in and to take lots of pictures of the scenery. The random people here are all very friendly and so are the staff from the Visitor Center.  The place definitely looks different when you compare from summer and winter.

I love how the ladies get in for free and offer free drinks! I thought the crowd was good and the staff was overall great!  Unfortunately, I saw my friend get treated very unkindly by one of the security people. She was in the way (it really didn't appear that way) of the walking area. The security asked her to move and she said ok. Then for whatever reason the security just went off on her and told my friend to not have an attitude with him or he will kick her out. She looked at him all puzzled and asked what she had done wrong. She explained to him that he had asked her to move and she just said ok. His response was awful! He basically started screaming at her and at the end told her to shut her mouth. I can't believe how rude this guy was!!! I have never seen a security guy be so rude to a girl. And seriously, she did nothing wrong and was following exactly what he told her to do. Having to have seen this happen...I had to lower down the stars. I would not want any of my friends or any of you go through this. One more thing...when this happened we were in the VIP area with a group of people. Can't believe this jerk treated my friend like this who was in the VIP! Rude, rude boy!

This is the nicest library I've seen in Phoenix. I only went here for a few minutes, but when I got in, I just felt an instance rush of happiness like a kid. It's getting remodeled inside, but I can't wait to see how it'll turn out. I'll be visiting here more often since my work is relocating towards downtown area. The next time I come, I have to explore the place a little more because I only stayed in the first floor and I heard it was 4 stories. Oh...the glass elevator looks awesome!

I admit that I only usually come here on Tuesdays cuz that's when they have their special on wings. I LOVE eating wings and I totally fell in LOVE with the SALT & VINEGAR flavor...oh man! That is what I'm talking about!!!  This place can get crowded and service is not as great due to crowds, but it's alright.

I love going to this spot. They've got great music and the karaoke spot is crazy! It's always fun to watch some drunk people perform. The host also does a great job entertaining the crowd. They have specials on drinks...they always mix them up. No cover charge for the girls...that's how it should be. =o) Sometimes there is a coverage charge if there is a special event going on.

I wonder what happens if I don't fill out a star because that is what they deserve!  Apparently, you have to put a star...ugh!  Came her last month (Feb 2012) to take care of some business...within a month I started to get some documentations of some of the business that was taken care of...except for the most important one. I called Bank of America Customer Service...doesn't show any changes. Told me to go to the same location bank I went to make the changes and to meet with the same rep. Went to this bank again (March 2012) to try to meet with rep, but the line was too long (just like last month...waited for an hour and then the meeting took like an hour)...so I was smart enough to not wait and make an appointment the following week. When I tried to make the appointment, I insisted I meet with the same rep, but the person wouldn't do it. BS! Excuse my language. So I go there today and met with the same rep. I explained my situation and she obviously doesn't remember and I understand since she probably works with a lot of people. But when I told her the reason why I came there last month and how she was "helping" me...she said that it would have been impossible for her to help me out in any way so it couldn't have been done. Are you kidding me? Why did she waste my time and assuring me things would be taken care off...when in reality it was impossible for her to help me? Then I asked for copies of documentations that were done last month...and she said they don't keep any documentations in their office. Wow! Just WOW! I can't believe the hours this bank has wasted my time and for the POOR customer service this bank has. Ohhh...I had asked if they have a bank outside the country and she gave me an address and phone number from her Google search on Wiki. LoL! Are you serious??? Why wouldn't she just go to the Bank of America website which should be a reliable source instead of Wiki??? And I kept insisting they do not have one in this country and advised they did at one point, but no anymore, but the rep was like...yes they do look here on Wiki. I left after this...what BS! I went home and went on the Bank of America website for international and confirmed there is no bank in that country.   Sorry to be so angry...but this happened just a few hours ago. Customer service such as these upset me...because you are suppose to rely on them for help and to trust them that they are doing their job...it's truly disappointing to discover that nothing was done.

I've been going here for the past 3 years since it's the closest one from work. The place is clean and well staffed. I've always been greeted when I walk in and when I leave. All the workers are generally friendly; however, some may stand out more than others. One particular guy, Timothy, always has a smile on his face when he greets me and is very courteous even when they are busy. Since I go there frequently, I feel like I get royal treatments and I must admit...I do enjoy it!  I hate getting shocked when I open doors so I usually take my time at the front door. I have to touch the glass then tap the door handles a few times before I get the courage to put my bear hands to open the door. Apparently when I opened the door it wasn't busy inside and like all the staff had been watching me. I kind of got a weird look from them and Timothy says BOO when I walk in and I just respond by saying that I must have looked like an idiot. I was a little embarrassed, but everyone had a good laugh.  Our office is moving soon so I hope the new FedEx spot I end up going to is just as great as this place.

This place is awesome! I went here before with my boss and I had their Machaca tacos...and this is when I fell in love with Machaca.   I went here again for breakfast this time with my boss. I had the Machaca con Huevos and oh my...it was amazingly delicious! The really cool thing about going here for breakfast was that they still serve chips and salsa right way. It was great! They have traditional chips, but they're chips are like wontons. It's really good!  Service has been great every single time I've been here. It's a definitely must-try place. Enjoy!

My friend and I went here last Saturday. I thought it was a great place. The music overall was great! I like the mix of music, but towards the end of the night, I just wasn't feeling the music (it was off and on for me, but that's just me being picky).   My friend ordered a glass of Vodka and Red Bull. The bartender said that it was $2 extra for Red Bull and she was fine with it. She said the drink was strong. She ordered another and closed her tab which was only a total of 4 bucks!!! How great is that!   There was a good mix of people at the club. Met some interesting individuals. I'd definitely come back to check out the place again for the music and the next time around, I might want to buy a drink or two cuz it's so cheap!  The dance floor was small, but decent. But when the floor is crowded with people dancing (or those just standing around watching) it gets extremely hot...but isn't that how it is everywhere? They've got stripper poles in the dance floor...hahaha...that's always a plus for the drunk ones. I tried to get some guys to use the stripper poles, but I guess they didn't have enough to drink cuz they didn't dance. =o( LoL! But I did see 2 guys go up and a few girls.

I have been here several times and it has always been so good to me! I love coming here for the 16oz steak! YummyYumYum!!! The steak is cooked just the way I order it and it is seasoned well. Ask for your hash to be more crispy to get that extra crunch!  Do come a little early because you will probably find yourself waiting...there is always a line! But the food is great and the workers are friendly. This place is packed to it's max! Meaning...you'll be closely sitting to some stranger...but if you sit outside (since the weather is so lovely) you'll have more elbow room.

My boss took a few of us here on 07-15-10 because he saw it on Man vs. Food. We ordered their famous Del Rey Torta and this meal was huge and absolutely delicious! I was only able to consume half the sandwich, you can surely bring a friend to split the meal. I would definitely go back and order this again. They also give you a red and green salsa. The red one is great cuz its got some heat after you keep eating some. Their ceviche is wonderful too!  I also had their flan, but I wasn't a big fan of it. I make my own and mine is creamy and sweet. Theirs is...the opposite.  Our order of water took awhile. The one in the group that ordered Coke got their drink first, probably cuz they paid for their drink...joking. But I ended up requesting to get our waters then they brought it.  Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely need to stop for the Del Rey Torta again and bring some friends.

I really do just love this place...from the very first time I set foot. Unfortunately, the first time I came here, my friend and I waited for about 2 hours, but it was well worth it. I came here after watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and knew I was going to order the caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. How was it? Ummm...absolutely divine!!! The second time I came here, (LoL) I decided I didn't want to wait and I arrived at 6:40am. Yup, I learned my lesson the first time. FYI: These days were during the weekend...so they have a tendency to be more crowded. I recently went back here to bring some friends for breakfast and as always the food was great. We got everything that was featured from Food Network. =o) I wasn't too sure about the waffle dogs after watching it from Best Thing I Ever Ate because it's just a sausage in waffle batter...that you can really compare to a corn dog. I was completely wrong! The waffle dogs were so perfect! The ratio of sausage to batter was great! It was just so tasty! To be perfectly honest, we ended up having to get another order after devouring our other plates. It's a definite MUST-TRY! The dipping sauce totally caught me off guard...I think I was just expecting something sweet, but boy was I in for a little shock! It's actually a mix of Cholula Hot Sauce and maple syrup. The after shock of something spicy was a little weird, but dip the waffle dog into the sauce and it's a perfect combination! I find myself just thinking about these waffle dogs and how easy it would be to just eat them as I drive to work. *drool* The next time I come, I might just have to order 2 or 3 orders just for me (I don't want to share). LoL!

It was my first time here and I really wanted to see the metro pizza myself - and oh my goodness! You can watch the person rolling out the dough and turning it into a 39 inch pizza. The pizza was delicious!!! I want another metro pizza! Got the Sausage with Broccoli (the sausage is amazing here - please try), the pizza with the Artichoke, and their Vegetarian pizza. All were delicious!  They also start of by serving you bruschetta (thumbs up). I ordered a pasta dish with mussel and calamari - sauce was great with a hint of heat. I decided to get dessert to end my meal - Creme Brulee.  Man, am I stuffed! But the food was fantastic! So glad I finally tried this little gem so I can come back.  I must add that our server was awesome - super attentive and answered our first timer questions.  Lastly, the bill arrived with a rose for me - awwww moment and I also got to take the balloon home too! Not only did I fall for their food...now they really captured my heart! I'll be back...count on it for sure!

I love this place!!! This is a hidden gem inside an Asian market place. One of the things that surprised me was their workers spoke English very well (in my experience, this isn't common). The service I received from this place was Super Excellent. The food and the service makes me want to come back. The best thing I ate from this place is their Fried Pork with Seasoned Salt and Jalapeno (perfectly cooked and so tasty!)...broccoli with garlic sauce (you just can't go wrong with this mix)...and I had their combination of roasted duck, pork, and BBQ pork (I thought this was just okay).  I would definitely recommend this place and will come back again!

OhhhhhEmmmmGeeee!!! I totally heart this place!!!! My friends and I came here for the very first time and...it's just...so...heavenly! I just had to try a scoop of the pineapple sorbet and coconut sorbet. It was pleasant. After my friends and I ate our 2 scoops we discovered that this place was actually featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. First off, vanilla ice cream just sounds so plain and simple. Second, I am so-not into salted sweet stuff (salted butter caramel just doesn't sound pleasing to my taste buds).  But we went ahead and ordered the Toffee Banofi Sundae which is consisted of double scoop vanilla bean with fresh bananas, toffee butter crunch, salted butter caramel and whipped cream (Alton Brown's recommendation - Food Network). You've got to put each little pieces of heaven in each spoon and savor the flavor! The combination of all these goodness is so perfectly put together. It's going to be hard to imagine eating ice cream else where. This place totally rocks!  I have to also admit that sometime it may seem that Yelpers might bring too much of a hype on some places, but you really never know unless you try. Even though some recommendations don't necessarily sound pleasing to your senses, you should have an open taste bud to try new things because you can discover something quite heavenly (it may shock you).  Try this place if you haven't...it's seriously delicious!!!

I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!   They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.    So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.    I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).    Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.  That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.

I was in this side of town and was craving Greek food. Checked out the reviews and thought this would be a good place to try...but I was extremely disappointed! I can't believe I'm giving the first bad review on their food... This is absolutely my least favorite place of all the Greek restaurants I've tried. They do have a young boy working the cashier/taking orders and he did okay for his age. The service was poor. I think this place lacks people skills. No one follows up to ask how your food was. Okay, yes...it's a small place and maybe the workers might be young, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't check on your customers. And they certainly didn't follow up to bring my baklava (that they forgot to give me in the first place). The food was...well...just like their service, it was poor. The food presentation looked great, but my taste buds just didn't agree. .:sorry:.

I totally love this little place!!! The family that owns this place are friendly. The service I've received have always been excellent. The food has never failed me. I love their Panang and Eggplant...I find it really difficult to avoid ordering the same thing, but it's just so yummy! This is by far the best Thai food I've had in the Phoenix area.

I'm going to give this a 5-star for their Avocado Shake! I love, love, LOVE their avocado shake. It's best made when the owner (father looking man) makes them. His kids (well at least I think it's his kids) help out and make the shakes too, but it  just doesn't compare to how he makes them.  I'm not into trying the other shakes because they're not made with real fruits...they use powder mixes...except for the avocados.

I suggested we go here for my boss' surprise birthday for lunch!  The place was not packed during lunch on a Friday. The place was beautiful! The staff was super friendly. First thing I had was their Cheese Bread and I MUST admit, it was the best that I have ever had. The cold/salad section was wonderful! I couldn't believe the huge Parmesan cheese they had...OMG! I love the idea of just sitting down and having the food come to me. Once you turn your sign to GREEN...the meat just came out one after the other and it was WONDERFUL! Every person at our table (group of 5) took a bite of meat and all you could hear, one by one, was MMMMMMMMMM!!! I caught myself MMMMMM then I heard the next person say it too then I just started noticing that we were all MMMMMMing. LoL! I told one of the staff that it was my boss' birthday and they give a FREE DESSERT of your choice.  Would I come back here again: Most DEFINITELY!

A quick FYI: This coming week for Restaurant Week they will be offering dinner for $40 per person...a great deal!  I love LOVE this place! I love the wide selection of their Salad Bar and Meats. I also LOVE their desserts!

Late notice, but for the month of August they are offering one service you've never had for a buck (certain services only)!  This place is clean and sanitary. The workers are friendly. If you come here, I would recommend to ask for Erika.

I've been here a few times and I absolutely love having lunches here.   Let's see what I have tried from this place.  Lahvosh...gotta have! I had their Cajun Chicken Lahvosh; however, I have fallen in love with their Garlic Shrimp Lahvosh. It is bombay!!! I could probably just have a full order of Lahvosh as my lunch, but I have always gotten a half portion so I can try their other yummy foods.  Sandwiches Upon the recommendations of many, I ordered the Coca-Cola Ham sandwich...and WoW! It is wonderful!!! Their Seasoned Beach Fries have great flavor too. The Spicy Sirloin and Fernando's Chicken pretty much tasted the same to me. It was just alright. Fire Island...some of you have mentioned about this and I'm not sure if this is what ya'll were talking about. This was good, but really extra cheesy for me, but if you like cheesy food then this meal might be for you.  Mini Cookies At the end of your meal, you are suppose to get these mini chocolate chip cookies. I've only had them given to me once . It's just a great bonus at the end...free food (who would say no to that?).

I actually love this little place. It's clean and the staffs are friendly!   First time I came here I got the Torta Cubana and the Torta Mexicana. Both tortas were good, but I definitely loved the Cubana much more. The torta (I think this is the bread part) is tasty and soft. I could probably just eat the bread itself, but the mix of meat and the juices...that's a whole new taste bud there...so good!  They have a few salsas and grilled veggies free for grabs. They also have ice cream or gelato; not sure which one. I haven't tried any of the desserts, but they look tempting.   Came back and got the Tacos de Ribeye which is so good!!! They give you lots of meat and I love how it comes with a slice of avocado on each taco!   I didn't even know they had pastry on the other side of the restaurant until the second time I came...LoL! I came here 3 times within the first week that I discovered this place. I'm actually not much of a sandwich person, but the Cubana satisfies me completely. =o)

After my horrible review, I was contacted by this place to give them another try with another person that they say is much better. I figured I should give them another chance because one person should ruin the whole company, right? Anyway...as I promised, I would update my review...I call this an update, but want to keep my previous review posted as that was my worst experience ever. =o( I came back here and met with a new person. I'm happy to say that my hair was not yanked in any way and was treated much better; however, there was just something that seemed so off. At first I thought it was just me and maybe going to the Scottsdale location spoiled me in some ways, but no. I truly believe that the services in this place is just not comparable to Scottsdale or the one in Glendale, AZ. I went to the next closest place to me which was in Glendale and they performed their services just as great as Scottsdale! =o) So...with this experience I can finally say that this particular location just does things differently that are not pleasant to me. They wax over the same spots and it's just a harsh feeling...you know when they keep waxing at the same spot...it becomes more sensitive, but they just keep waxing...it's that kind of harsh feeling. Just like any places you decide to read reviews on...there are going to be awful reviews and great reviews...but it really boils down to your own experience and how you like it. Sorry to say that I will never come back to this place...the only reason I would come back is if my current esthetician started working here.   Previous Review: I've been to Scottsdale location, but wanted to try this out since it's so much closer to me, but my goodness! This is by far the worst service I have ever received!!! I should not have given a tip, but I guess I just felt bad if I didn't tip...such a mistake in my part. I really hate to give such a bad review and I'm not even going to mention the person's name. I came here to get a facial and particular person dropped some wax and it dripped to the back of my neck. She began yanking on long hair without even giving me warning! She blamed my hair for getting on the wax. Are you seriously serious??? I felt like she was a newbie and who was so unsure of what she was doing. I would NEVER come back to this specific location!!!

I really like the choices of salsa. They give you some interesting flavours and textures by using pecans and jicama. As weird as it sounds, it's worth trying it out to discover new things and it might surprise you like it did me.  When I came here, I was a little disappointed because they didn't have any shrimps so I couldn't get one of the tacos I wanted. I ended up getting  the Baja Sur Shark Taco and another taco. Both were very good, but I did prefer the Shark Taco. I also had their horchata which was just okay...it had too much cinnamon for me, but I like the addition of fruits and nuts with it.  This place gets crowded especially during lunch time and it's a small place. They've got interesting paintings on the walls.

Went here with some family because we were desperate for food. The food was ok, but I think I just expected to be "wowed." One thing I did like...they had a few choices of hot sauces to add to your food. The staff were friendly, but I don't think I would come back to give it another try.

I feel horrible! I wrote a previous comment on this place, but it was intended for another place...my bad. Sorry.  I went here late at night and the staff was great! I just love eating chicken!!! I wish their chicken was more spicy; I'm just looking for that kick! I'm not a big fan of sweet ice tea and I can barely swallow one sip, but their sweet ice tea is yummy! Sugar cane sugar makes things wonderful!

After reading the reviews from Faith and Thomas, I decided to stop by at this place because it's really close by to my pad.  I was greeted by a guy when I walked in and he showed some of their display of meals. He was very helpful as to answer my questions for descriptions of their food.  I decided to order the Family Meal of 20 taquitos that came with beans, rice, chips and salsa. Also orders carne asada burrito and horchata. The horchata was just okay, it wasn't bad, just not the best that I've had. The taquitos were alright, but if you add on the lime and hot sauce...it's delicious! The beans were a bit salty, but good. The rice was just wonderful. The burrito was great and they put a good amount of carne asada in the filling.  I really wanted to try their panderia section, but I came here for dinner and decided that I should just visit next time in the morning when it's more fresh, but I must admit, when someone passed by with their tray of pastries...oh man...was I tempted! It smelled so GOOD!!! Overall, a great experience and would definitely come by again!

I was on a hunt for a new esthetician for quite a while since mine moved out of state, but now I can finally stop! Yay!!! Read the reviews and saw the 50-50 really awesome and really horrible experience, which scared me so much due to my worst experience from another location, but I said I needed to give this place a chance and see how they work for me. I am so glad I took the step in coming here for the first time and meeting with Jessica. She was just so great! She was very professional and gave great advice! I would definitely recommend her! Like I said, I have finally stopped looking around because from this point on I'll be seeing her. =o)

Of all the times I've come here...I have received the best customer service ever! The owner of this place is so down to earth and friendly. The food is amazing! I thought it was a little weird to have coconut and pineapple as a topping on top of hot dogs, but mix it in with their chipotle mayo...bang! You got this sweet and spicy thing going on and it's so wonderful! The other time I came here he made a special request for me. I have been wanting to try their wings because of the "odd" use of his secret ingredient sauce. The wings were just as delicious as their hot dogs. I have to try the burgers next.

5 stars rating makes me want to check out places, but I was a bit iffy when I fist came here. It's a strange looking place, but I decided to come here during daytime (made me feel safer). Once you get in...it doesn't look any much nice, BUT the staff is super friendly!  I tired all the dollar tacos (I mean...how can you really go wrong, right?). BUT...I tired the FISH TACOS...oh boy oh boy!!! It's the BEST I've ever had for such a cheap price! Seriously, you MUST try them. The horchata is like a hit and miss with me, but it was the first time I ever had it with fruits and nuts...it's pretty good. The little side of grilled onions is *wiping my drool* so good! I don't prefer not to eat onions...I'm not into them, but it's so good from this place. I know this place has lots of 5 stars and you might think people are putting too much hype into the place, but go try it out and judge for yourself...but if you are craving for fish tacos...definitely hit this spot!

Hmmm...I was really excited about coming here, but I was disappointed in their service. I came just past lunch time so that I could avoid the crowd, so by the time I arrived, it was just me. I didn't get greeted, but instead I greeted the guy in the front. He didn't start any small talk with me and it was my first time here. =( He took my order and I just waited to get my food. The lady that came out to ring me was much pleasant, but it was very short. I take into account how people intermingle with their customers - it's a big thing in my book as well as the taste in their food. So...the food was great, but nothing that stands out more than any other Jamaican place I've been to. I'm a bit harsh sometimes, but I won't be coming back since I didn't feel welcomed here.

This place is pretty decent for it's price and what they offer. I came here because I had purchased a voucher. It is inside a mall and there is only 2 courses with 18 holes each, but you get to play 3 games.  They've got great paintings on the walls (glow-in-the-dark).  I would have to pick this place out versus playing mini golf outside in the heat. I did come back here again while I was babysitting and they enjoyed the place. The kids really liked the fact it was glow-in-the-dark and the paintings. Doesn't seem like many people come here...I would suggest to check it out.

I went here for Grand Opening for a sneak peak. They had a minimum of $2.00 for admission in which part of the proceeds are being donated to a charity. There was a long line, but it flowed pretty smooth.    This was my first time ever going to a maze...wasn't quite too sure of what to expect. They did a great job with the graphics and how the place was decorated overall. There were people sneaking up on us and they totally got me. One guy got me good 3 times...I think they he thought I was a good target cuz I was such a scaredy cat. =o(  Overall, it was done well and it was a great experience for my first maze.

This place has one of the most friendliest staff! I usually come her to dine in. The service is fast and the food is tasty! I like how they give free soup when you dine in. The price of the meal and the serving is a great deal! They will also customize meals for you if you want to take something in/out or have the meat cooked a certain way like from another dish they have. It's a nice and quiet spot.  Today, I actually called in for pick up. I only ordered soup cuz I'm sick. But the person who answered the phone was so friendly and understanding. He had asked if I was sick then he said that he was sick last week...and that there must be something going around. And before the conversation ended he said I hope you feel better. =)  I just love friendly people! And on top of that...they got good food. I'll be back...soon!

I love how quickly they can bake your pizza and I love having the control of deciding what goes on my pizza. This is a great little spot to grab a quick meal during lunch. The ingredients are a great variety and look mighty tasty! I like to change up my order when I come here...the choices are endless!

The first time I went here, they didn't have the Chef's Signature Dish. I believe at the time it was Osso Buco. Today, it's my birthday and I wanted to come here to celebrate and get a Chef's Signature Dish, the lamb chops, but they didn't have it. They didn't have the other Chef's Signature Dish, mahi mahi. It was just a disappointment - worst feeling on your birthday. I did stay because everyone else didn't have a problem with their order. I was able to try the New Peaks for the appetizers. Our server was kind enough to give me any dessert for my birthday so I was able to try the New Peak on the desert list. I'm the type of person who likes to try new items and things that are on a limited time. I would suggest calling first to make sure they have the Chef's Signature Dishes.  I did give a 4 star even though I was very disappointed. I'm trying not to rate according to my feelings completely. The food was good and so was the service. But I still didn't get my lamb chops. =(

I went here for the first time with a friend and it was absolutely terrific! The atmospher was very laid back. Staff was friendly! Food was delicious!   I ordered a PBBLT - I love seeing the word Pork Belly so I had to get this sandwich. The fries on the side was plenty. The service was fast and my water was always filled!   I can't wait to come back here again!

I ordered my food online and they forgot the BACON! They also forgot the condiments on the side for my side items. They also messed up on the sauce I requested.  Also, I was not satisfied with my food, baby back ribs and the chicken crispers. The food was cold. Overall, just a disappointment.
