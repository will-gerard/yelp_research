Alan Cawthon is amazing... he has been doing my hair for over three years now.  He just made the move to Sachi and I am very excited for him.... if you are looking for an amazing hairdresser, he is your guy! He always gives you what you ask for and offers excellent opinions and advice if your are unsure.   He will make a great addition to Sachi!

We just moved to Mesa and were happy to hear about this place. We love Mexican food.  We were looking forward to a green chile burro enchilada style.  The meat in the burrito tasted like canned meat and was gravy like.  The rice and beans tasted like canned food too.  Not authentic at all.  We did not finish our food but ate a lot of chips and salsa which weren't bad.  Finished our drinks and left.   I am not sure why everyone raves about this place..... They must not know good mexican food.  We won't be back.
