Stopped in yesterday for a quick lunch with the kids after a visit to the Science Center.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Worst experience as a mom ever!!  The waitress, Abriana, did not have customer service skills whatsoever.  Our orders came out incorrect, figures since she didn't even write them down.  After we informed her that the orders were wrong, she proceeded to tell us that we were wrong and this is what we ordered.  Kids have been waiting almost 35 minutes for the food now.  We had the manager come over.  He apologized for the error and waited on us the rest of the visit. Food was good, but the service was not up to par.  We would not go back.

Very good food, nice atmosphere, efficient wait staff.  My only complaint would be that there is always a wait for a table. Get there early people!

Great sushi!! Service is just okay. The happy hour is great and super affordable. The sashimi has always been fresh. We live around the corner from this place so we frequently go here. Definitely would recommend it!

Food was great, nice atmosphere, lots of space so you don't feel cramped.  Service was quick.  We went for lunch during the week and it was a great experience.

Awesome neighborhood bar/burger joint. The Cheese Burger gang approves and will be back for more!!  Between the four of us, we tried the Texas All American, the California (on special), the Double Down Bacon Cheeseburger and the Classic Cheeseburger. All were great and full of flavor! We shared the herbed fries and the sweet potato fries. Both very tasty!  For dessert we went with the House Bread Pudding and the Warn Doughnuts with salted butterscotch...and these desserts were awesome!!!!  Can't wait to go back!
