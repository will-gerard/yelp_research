I went in to the salon to see my girl, Kendra, and had a new hairstyle in mind for my curly hair. With the sweltering summer on the way, I wanted to cut a ton of length and darken my blonde tresses. After showing her a few Pinterest pins and talking through what would be the plan of attack, she started on what was about to be my favorite hairstyle ever! Kendra takes so much care and is such a pro. She even diffused my hair, instead of the usual blow out, to see what my typical hair, now short 5 inches, would look like. ( by the way, 5 inches on curly hair is about 7 to 9 inches  in curly hair) It is perfect! Better than I planned. I also want you to know that my face is pretty square with a large "four-finger" forehead, short hair is not typically the friend of that shape. I love it, I love it, I love it! Curly hair girls, start lining up!

Do yourself a favor and try a cranberry scone! They are so delicious. I personally like mine with butter. The food is always fresh and so satisfying. The only part I would change is the consistency of some of the food. I love the chicken salad sandwich, but somedays the mixture has too much mayo, and a tip... ALWAYS order dressing on the side for salads. Otherwise be prepared for soaked veggies.

Very friendly staff. They get super busy but they offer same day appointments if you don't want to wait to see one of the bankers. They also offer a lot of ATM services so that you can skip waiting in the long teller line. They have an app that you can make check deposits and also you can make an apt through the app as well! Love B of A!

I've used this pharmacy for the last 2 years and I can't say enough good things about all of the pharmacy techs. They want to help you as much as they can. They are not numb to the fact that everyone is grumpy and clearly needs help. They try to work your insurance as much as they can and don't shrug you off.  One pharmacist in particular, Mr. Harjit, goes above and beyond, he is the Indian gentleman with a great demeanor and treats you with kindness and respect.

For all the ironic hipsters, bargain hunters, vintage cravers, and trend following junkies and out there, look no more, here is your desert oasis. You will no doubt find your one of a kind diamond here. You will find everything from mid level designers ( Kate spade, Marc Jacobs ect...) to department store brands, preppy, hippie, grunge, the list goes on. The staff is mostly hipster, cochella-esq complete with body covering tattoos and piercings. They are super nice and will happily make suggestions to help.   The cherry on top is that you can sell your fab closet as well as add to it. The buyers have to be picky with what they will take from you. They are fully stocked but will never miss an opportunity for a funky find. They do have guidelines! So don't be upset when they don't buy your 4 year old "trendy" sweats stained clothes.

This is such a cute coffee shop! I like the outdoor seating and there are regular who claim a certain shaded table... So beware!  the staff is so friendly and very fast. Morning coffee runs are so much more pleasant when the barista is nice and offers espresso shots. Double shot iced Americans please! Black, no sweetener.

I love this little sandwich nook in Tempe! The sandwiches are so tasty but the baked goods is the reason that you go for sure! Be sure to get your punch card for a free bread loaf! Yum!

Tacos were amazing.  Period. Very tasty and flavorful. The refried beans were house made and delicious. This review is not for the drinks. My margarita was ok. And for the price of $8 it was meh. Next time I'll have a $5 Mexican beer and I'll know what I'm getting. The Service was great and they made the most of the small space and were flipping tables as fast as they could. The salsa bar had an array of about 15 flavors ranging from super spicy to very mild. I'll be back for more tacos soon.

Service was ok. The place was a mess the counter was full of dirty blenders, and instead of washing those, the guy went to the back to get clean ones to add to the pile. He was nice enough, but was wearing a backpack the whole time and a flannel shirt... Other locations wear the one stop tee or a polo or something! I was only in there for a smoothie, and that had no flavor! Super  disappointing.  I'll stick to my other locations  from now on.

We had outstanding service from Hansen's . We received a prompt estimate and service the same week. On the service day they were on time. Before I knew it, he was done and the work was fantastic! From now on, we will only go to Hansen's for any of our plumbing needs.

These coaches are so motivating and drive you to work hard! No matter where your fitness level is, count on getting an amazing workout. Worth it. Michelle even took the time after gym hours to give me a 45 min. nutrition consult. She gave me the tools to succeed outside OTF!

I went for dental work that I needed done and I feel compelled to write a review about my experience. When I got in the chair, it seemed perfectly nice and comfortable. There was a TV right above my face to enjoy while I had a cavity filled By JUSTINE, My dentist. This is where the trouble began. She consistanly commented on my "baby teeth" telling me that they were abnormally small for an adult.... Then her filling tool was malfunctioning while she was commenting on my teeth. In between that I felt she was not focused on my mouth as much as she should because she was talking about a reality show with her dental assistant. while she was so involved in the conversation, the "gun" would not fill the cavity, and the instrument she was using to pack the filling into my tooth, kept pulling the filling out. So she would have to start over with the malfunctioning gun. The irrigator tool, to keep my tooth hydrated, had too much pressure and was like a bad sprinkler that would ricochet off my tooth and spray out of my mouth and all over my face. All the while, she complained about how terrible her instruments were, but never apoplgizing. I later had a lot of pain and was concerned about that tooth. I found out that the filling was too high for my bite and all the pressure when I chewed was going on that tooth. I went to another dentist at Dental Brother's and he was able to file the filling down and fix the pain that Magic smiles created.

El chino taqueria is so hospitable! From the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a family home. The tacos were so good. It honestly doesn't matter what kind, just get some!  The owner, Raphael aka, the chino, was very helpful with recommendations and so friendly. The salsa bar was so fresh and had lots of options for toppings. Best taco experience yet!

Very hipster. Complete with marquee signage, random shapes and sizes of Edison lights, handmade salvaged wood bar, chalkboard menu with four types of grilled cheese sandwiches, and ALL of the beer and plenty of wine. Only down side is that you have to shimmy around the bar to find a seat and basically rub against the floor to ceiling chalkboard or a strangers back who is trying to enjoy their drink whilst being bumped into. Hence 4 stars.

I usually get the chicken pad Thai. I am a big fan! However the quality can fluctuate. I've had it a few times and it's been awesome and other times it's been not so great. I keep coming back so that says something! When it's good , it's SO good.

I love the decor and overall aesthetic of this place. The people working are nice and attentive once you get to ur table. However when we walked in no one greeted us or offered seating directions. The food is delicious! I had the Egg-cellent sandwich. Yum! And the potatoes had so much flavor. Super yum! And the cherry on top was that the coffee was rich and flavorful. I didn't have the heart to dock a full star just based on walking in, because EVERYTHING else was so good.

Very good food. Environment is not your typical pho joint. It's a bar that does live music, and has covers charged on occasion. Which I personally find annoying. My meal is $10 and the cover just to sit is $5? No thank you. I suggest getting your order to go. Calling ahead is fast and they are very good about getting your food out to you once you get there. Servers and service is good and very friendly. I will be back for the pho but not the live music.
