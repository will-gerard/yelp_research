I was first introduced to Matt's Big Breakfast when I was a resident of Flagstaff, AZ, where waiting for a good breakfast is an everyday part of life.  I know that some people in Phoenix will not be able to wait, since they have their Denny's and Waffle Houses in their neighborhood.  With that said, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait.  Waiting is good for you.  And the wait is usually not that long.  And, while you are waiting, there is stuff to look and see and do!  The Downtown Public Market is adjacent to Matt's, the people at the Coronado Hotel are pretty cool after you give them a cigarette or "shfifty shents".    The staff is always in a rush but as pleasant as cherubs.  The coffee smells delightful, and the honey lemonade is the bees knees  The food is the best part! I love the ingredients that Matt picks, which are local and organic when the product is convenient, affordable, or rockstar status.  All the eggs are from local cage free chickens.  All of the jams and jellies (which rotate on a daily basis) are from local businesses and they will probably help relieve any allergies you have (if you live in Phoenix).  When I was a young Big Breakfast eater, I enjoyed the Five Spot and worked my way up to the to the succulent egg and pork Chop and Chick before graduating to simply ordering the special, and trusting that Matt and his minions will take care of me.  The specials are the reason why I keep coming back, and why I bring my friends.  I have brought out of town poets, musicians, and artists to Matt's.  They all love the diner feel, the orange and simple menu, the nice and friendly staff, and of course - the BIG breakfast.

When you live in the hot desert, you get parched.  Carly's has the cure for  any kind of cottonmouth.  Mojitos, cheap beers, draft beers, coffee - if it's wet, they got it.  I've been to a lot of cold kitchens, and I have to say that Carly's does it better than most.  The hummus is kickin', the sandwiches are scrumptious, and the salads are put together better than anywhere else I've been too.  I take away two stars because on some nights, I've had to wait for over thirty minutes to get a menu and water.    It's too bad... a couple of years ago, CARLY's WAS THE BEST PLACE TO EAT IN DOWNTOWN PHOENIX.  I wish they would start hiring younger go-getters and not bartenders that were fired from other restaurants.  Some of my friends would even go as far as to call this place "Snarly's".  It's funny, but not accurate.    Back to the grub... If you order the hummus, get it with veggies or bread instead of the terra chips.  You will run out of chips before you run out of hummus.  Orzo is highly underrated and Carly's knows this - they offer it as a side to any sandwich of their menu.  The portion is small, but the light feta sprinkles on the orzo will rock your world.

Seven days a week, this bar is ready to be your destination.  The friendly and smart staff is ready to make you feel at home, find a drink that works for your budget and palette, and are polite enough to make it known that this neighborhood hangout is NOT a sports bar or dive.  The Lost Leaf was already my favorite bar to chat with a bartender.  When I was a single. lonely guy trying to establish my role in Downtown Phoenix, The Lost Leaf was the best place to get a nightcap, where I could talk to experienced and seasoned musicians, artists, and foodies.  Every person that works there is more than what meets the eye.  The Lost Leaf already had the best beer selection in The Valley, but they recently added a small draft selection, including the delicious locally brewed Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout.    Let's say you go to a party and you are talking to someone that is about to leave because their ex showed up.  Invite them for a nightcap at Lost Leaf.  You are at the poetry slam at Lawn Gnome and homegirl's poem rocked your socks off and you want to talk about the importance of  diversifying potato varieties in America's diet.  Tell her to meet you at The Leaf.  You went on a blind date and it went really well, and he smells so good, and his smile is so white, but you find out he doesn't drink, but you don't want to be only one drinking... buy him a soda at The Lost Leaf.    I have gone to the Leaf with sober friends, alcoholic partygoers, my girlfriend and my mother and everyone of them has had a good time.

The atmosphere they have created in Heritage Square is fantastic, and Rose and Crown has really figured out a couple of ways to keep the prestige and offer something with a little 'weird' to the mix.  I love the bizarre Clockwork Orange and Winston Churchill paintings and the busted quarter pool table that spits your billiard balls out for free games and 9 ball variation fun all night!  They host a really fun, funny, and interactive trivia night on Wednesdays.    The food is basic deep fried pub food, and the drinks are all bar standards at standard 'make money' prices, which is the only reason I won't give them the fifth star.    Two more compliments: 1) The jukebox is the best jukebox I have seen.  It has really bizarre music selection and it is tucked away in a doorway so it makes for a secret mood changer for someone that has a practical joker side to them when they are drinking.  2) The triple bar setup allows for quick drink pushing even during the busiest of times, brilliant bar design!

There is the salsa bar with around a dozen house made salsas.  I am truly amazed by this place. It is small so not recommended for big groups.  Maybe a second date if you notice a parking spot open as you are approaching.  Horchata with chopped nuts, fruit, and cinnamon for the win.

If you are vegan or a veg-curious, Pomegranate Cafe is the best hope you have to stick to your new-found diet.  The staff and owners are passionate, intelligent, and incredibly hardworking.    Look folks... in order to be able to make as much fresh food as this place does, it is going to cost a lot on overhead.  Just to carry all of the fresh veggies and fruits for smoothies and juice has to be a fridge jenga feat on it's own.  Most restaurant owners do not care enough about their regulars to make this a reality.  To be completely honest, Pom is undercharging on most of their pastries and juices which is why I am totally blown away by their customer service.  What's that?  You used to eat cheesecake while watching Oprah in the 80's but you can't do it anymore because your trainer said that those days are over?  Well, then you should eat the delicious RAW VEGAN CHEESECAKE at Pom (shhh... it's made of nuts and other goodies).  What's that?  You like to go to Whole Foods and pay 10 dollars for juice?  Pomegranate is faster, cheaper, and they use local ingredients when it is smart to do so.  Conscious capitalism indeed.  Oh, you like to eat in unique, vibrant settings?  This place has beautiful colored walls, an open view of the juice bar and clear fridges so you can dine and feel like you are part of the action.  While most places will hide what they do to YOUR food, Pom offers more transparency, so you can rest easy that your food is being prepared with great service and with fresh ingredients.  What is this green stuff?  Look, I have eaten a lot of the stuff here, but STRAIGHT UP, you have to try something that has the cilantro pesto.  This sauce will gussy up any Mexican food dish, a spark for the tip of your tongue, with a small lemon tang, and a nice fresh smooth and soothing swallow that blooms with spice and heat.  And this sauce is a beautiful baseball field green.  I didn't even know that this was a culinary possibility until I ate here.  I noticed that there are some reviews on here about bad service, but I was informed that the space was remodeled about a year ago.  Most of the one star and two star reviews were from before the remodel, which shows how much focus and attention the owners (a mother and daughter that currently work at Pom) and staff have really put into growing as an establishment.  Please, do yourself a flavor, and stop in for a juice or treat if you happen to be in the neighborhood.  You can either sit down and eat a full meal (appetizers, course, desert, coffee), or take a quick juice or pastry to go in minutes.  It can't be easy to offer so many types of service AND be all natural plant based.  KUDOS TO POM FOR SETTING THE BAR HIGHER.  Nom Nom Pom.

Downtown Phoenix needed a larger venue that could accommodate active dancers, puking drinkers, and wallflowers into a room that has a good sound system, year-round temperature control, acoustics, and good promoters.    Thank you Crescent Ballroom.  You saved the day.  Now I don't have to watch Phish in 120 degrees, turning into human bacon, paying too much for a foamy beer that is going to turn into pee water in two minutes.  Oh, and I don't even like the band anyway... because they always play in dusty-outdoor-half-empty amphitheaters with awful sound caused by rattling sheet metal and airplane noise pollution.  So, when a friend asks me,   "Dude, you want to spend 120 bones to see String Cheese Incident at Mesa Ampitheater?"     I am going to politely say no and go see Big Freedia from a dark corner in a cool ballroom and drink my delicious whisky and coke that only costs 5 bucks.    This venue is great for the music industry, it's great for the penny pinchers, it's great for the socialites, and it's great for Phoenix.  Charlie Sheen can't win this much with three nostrils.

I am not going to pretend I am a vegan anymore.  I look like a hipster, I smell like a hipster, and occasionally I eat like a hipster... so I have to eat some vegan stuff once in awhile.    I know that my vegan friends will not judge me for eating delicious little animals if I go with them to Green once in awhile.    When Thai food and salad bars are not enough, Green picks up the ball and paves the course for the future... providing a comfortable and hip atmosphere, great service, and mouthwatering delicious stomach stuffing.    I have eaten everything on the menu, and there is not a single thing on it I wouldn't order again, which I cannot say for any other eatery in the Valley.  But if I had to suggest something to a meat-eater that is venturing out into unknown territory, I would recommend "Thee Argentine Po Boy".    If you were raised by American McDonald's junkies like myself, and you are trying to change your eating habits, and you love to eat that ice cream cone after your McFeast, then feel free to hoof it over to Nami next door and satisfy the sweet tooth as well.  Thank you Green for making me feel a little less 1950's America in a ever-evolving world.

When my kidnappers finally dropped me off in an alley, I cut off the rope and removed the duct tape from my mouth.  The afternoon sun dried my tears and my belly thought my throat had been cut.  It was not.  I was famished.  I mean, I could have eaten an ox, an elephant, a scabby dog, and a horse between two vans.  My captors took my wallet with identification, my keys, and my belt.  All I had on me was a ten dollar bill.  There is only one place that would accept me in this condition and feed me enough food for my survival.  It is time to man up and get in line at the Chipotle.  When I entered the restaurant,  the air conditioning was an immediate relief.  For the last few days, my only form of air conditioning was a Popsicle being waved in my face.  And then I heard music coming out of plywood walls.  The corrugated steel and concrete made me have flashbacks of my echoing warehouse prison I was detained in.  I had to stay brave and line up with the people that have not read any books about "Communist Russia" or "The Grapes of Wrath".  We were all hungry, and evidently, we all forgot our wallets and purses and were forced to eat here with our ten dollar bills.  All of the employees were pissed off that they had to serve people food while wearing the same t-shirt for an entire week.  The air was permeated with beefgrease, and I imagine that odor clings to fabric.  It would be nice if companies that require dress codes gave their employees enough clothing for a week and not just one shirt... but then again, it would be nice if my pants were not falling off while I was trying to decide if I wanted three sloppy tacos or a drippy burrito.    I went with the drippy burrito, in order to not actually see what was going into my peckish gape.  The first thing the employees are eager to give you, is rice.  They will pile it on.  One heaping spoon was too much, but then she slapped on another small spoon too and smiled at me.  She was nice, and I was too hungry to tell her that she was taking up space for the real stuff.  I wasn't in a position to make a scene, although, in retrospect, everyone was already looking at me.  I was shuffling like a penguin down the assembly line because my ankles were still handcuffed together.  Jokes on them, I pawned those bad boys and got about as much as I paid for the Chipotle rice-filled burrito.  When I finally got a bite of beef, it was savored.  Not because it was prepared in a marinade and cooked to a mouth-watering perfection.  Because it had a piece of tough ligament or rubbery fat still attached.  Whatever.  I was hungry, and just spent the previous eight hours hogtied in the trunk of a car.  Don't judge.  It is really hard for someone to mess up a burrito that you tell them how to make.  I feel privileged enough now to write reviews on Yelp about all of the amazing artisans, small businesses, and kitchens that help make Phoenix a vibrant place to live and eat.  Mexican food is as diverse as the people and landscape that the food comes from.  When companies act as the face of an entire cultural experience in the exact same way all over the world, negative stereotypes are formed about Mexican food.  Chipotle, a company that brands itself  as a Mexican eatery is more representative of flavors and products that can be eaten in a Taco Bell than eating from an eatery in Hermosillo or Nogales.  Unfortunately, every corner in Phoenix is being taken up by cookie-cutter prefab restaurants that replace genuine opportunities for families and bootstrap DIYers to make something out of our unique life experience while providing healthier, fresh, and local products.  I was once kidnapped.  It was that day that I learned my city was hijacked.  Eat at Tacos De Jaurez on 7th St and Portland or La Santisima on 16th St just north of McDowell instead of Chipotle for better food in a more relaxed and comfortable community atmosphere for about the same pricepoint.

All convenience stores need a lone video game machine, cigarettes, an assortment of drinks, and an array of everyday items you may need to MacGyver through any crisis.  Bodega 420 has all of these things, AND they have healthy food alternatives to usual gas station or Circle K candy bars.  Fresh produce, bulk grains, local dairy... are just a few of the awesome things that this awesome store (located in a repurposed 1930's Sears catalog home) carries every single day!  Although Bodega may not have everything you may find in a Walmart, it comes pretty close for such a small space, and the locals have the advantage of being able to request what they would like to see inside the shop on the chalkboard by the front register.  I highly recommend this place for those staying in the International Hostel or any downtown Phoenix hotel, motel, resort for a quick flip-flop grab of some movie munchies or a college student that needs a cheap and healthier alternative to a Big Mac.

Old coffee beans, sugary crack drinks being suggested, and generic art on the walls means coffee shop FAIL to me.  This might be the only coffee shop that has covered parking, so if you are a really boring person that drives an SUV and has lots of screaming children, then I recommend you go here.  The staff was really nice and they are just happy to be out of Starbucks, and your screaming kids won't break anything valuable in this place because non of it is valuable.  There's even some nice couches for AA meetings and businessmen without offices.    I have also heard that they have great events.  I live down the street and have not seen evidence of this yet, but I hope that they put the culture in their name soon.  I mean, God worked for seven days and then he drank some coffee and created culture, right?

When I was a young man driving across America, I developed a lovely relationship with Waffle House.  Now that I am a married man planning on having children, I try to eat fresh plant-based foods more often.    Bragg's Factory Diner is - forks over knives - the best vegetarian breakfast and lunch spot in Phoenix.  They serve everything a highway diner should: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes and waffles, and an array of sandwiches.  Other than the eggs and the occasional slice of cheese on a sandwich, the menu is VEGAN, and they do not skimp on flavor and taste.  The kitchen staff must have been chemists before they opened, because they figured out how to properly execute a vegan BLT (using a vegan marinade on eggplant that is comparable in taste and texture to crispy, delicious bacon).  Oh, and the diner is located in a quaint historic pie factory.  Much to my delight and Waffle House "nostalgialust" - Bragg's Factory Diner does have pie and they serve it from a refurbished 1950's style rotating pie-case.  Pie-case, now there's a device we don't see anymore.  Oh, and the pie is also vegan with a flaky pastry crust that will keep your slice intact and gooey contents contained.  The coffee is delicious, the staff is nice/young/hip, and the decor pays homage to the Arizona days of yore.  Why are you still reading this?  Go stuff your pie-hole!

Located near ASU downtown campus, Melt. is a perfect addition to the Arts' District.  I mean, why didn't we have a local ice cream parlor in PHOENIX yet?  The small shop is ran by a nice youthful and friendly couple and the ice cream is made with local ingredients.  You can grab ice cream and take it next door to Lost Leaf and make a beer float, take it across the street to the bookstore and watch the open mic, or just sit on Melt.s incredible front patio.  At first I was a little scared of their 7 dollar milkshake until I was reminded that it was made using local dairy products (and it was the most delicious shake I have ever put in my face).  Melt.  It's a First Friday must stop venue too!

I thought I was over hot dogs.  Short Leash has proved me wrong.  I was impressed with the concrete and tiled bar, the sleek and curved wood barstools, the gray and white wallpaper, the cute mantras of good living with fun orange and turquoise colors.   My wife and I were greeted by a very nice young lady who sat us at a community table.  Maybe it's just me... but I am usually weird about this kind of thing.  I hate to eat in public anyway, since eating time is when I get a chance to relax and not think about putting on a smile or selling something to someone.  You know?  Someone serving me.  Well, this was not the case. In this place, I saw a few people I have known from years in the Phoenix area, and then realized that the community table is a new concept that I actually enjoy.  I look forward to sitting at this table and possibly have a conversation with Alice Cooper, the Mayor, my neighbor, my teacher from 2nd grade.  This concept is especially great for a neighborhood full of artists and college students!  Thanks Short Leash for making me get out of my comfort zone and appreciating my community over great tasting food (at a community table, you are more likely to be offered a bit of someone else's appetizer...)  I am going to keep this leash short - THE FRIED PICKLES are one of the greatest things I have ever stuffed in my face.  The pickles are thick-sliced and prepared with a slight spicy kick (what they put in their brine is a mystery to me).  The panko outside is chunky, crisp, and dry!  Each bite was deep-fried magic  The staff was nice, casual, knowledgeable, and not afraid to make substitutes to give each customer what they are looking for.    The hot dogs are incredible and range from classic styles to new spins and ingredients with a unique flair that could only be born from a very competitive food truck market!  I ordered the Mac Daddy, and although the meal was not what I expected (I expected macaroni noodles but was surprised to find cheesy penne on my hot dog) I felt that it was a smart move and was probably a healthier and more tasty alternative.   The chili had black beans in it, and I give it a thumbs up too.  When we left, I felt great.  Usually when I consume a meatbrick from a pub or bar I feel like a tub of lard wallowing out into the street.  At Short Leash, I feel like they have really created something fun and savory for Phoenix that left me satisfied, relaxed and entertained.

If I am up late and my tummy is grumbly, I am almost certain I am going to end up here to get two of the best slices of pizza I have had in Phoenix.  The ingredients are fresh, the pizza is never burnt, the staff is what you would expect from a tough-guy-hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Grand Ave, the specials are different every single day, they deliver, GAPC offers whole pies and slices.  I used to have the high score on some of the old arcade games there, so if you beat my score, you have to buy me a slice since I was the one that told you to come here in the first place.
