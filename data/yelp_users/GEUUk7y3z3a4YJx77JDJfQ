Graat program for teaching kids to swim.  Love that it is indoor so you do not have to worry about the weather elements or applying sunblock.  Staff is very friendly and they are organized about the whole process...from billing to scheduling.  The place is immaculate and they take their water safety very seriously.  Highly recommend Aquasafe!

My husband and I went to CG with no reservation truly hoping to eat in the bar.    We could sit right away and proceeded to get the worst service we have ever encountered.  The bartenders were a man and woman and were actually bickering at each other the whole night in front of the customers.  They looked disheveled and acted completely overwhelmed.  We had to beg for service......and even tried to waive to get attention.  We had to ask several times for wine, bread and dessert.  They barely made eye contact and were cleaning glasses in the bar dishwasher.  I say the kitchen should do the dishes b/c the bartenders were spending their valuable time loading/unloading the dishes instead of waiting on customers.  Plus, the dishwasher was emanating the strongest chemical steam every time they opened the dishwasher...so a complete appetite buster.  The food came out under cooked.......I even ordered the onion soup and the cheese was not even melted on top so obvious to the kitchen, runner, waiter and bartender  but they still served it any way...thus cold soup.  My husband ordered the smoked salmon and it looked and smelled ripe.  Our steak entrees were wonderful....but it is a steak house....so pretty much expected that.  The restrooms are located past the kitchen where the waiters/waitresses are moving at rapid pace in and out of....so it truly is like running the gauntlet to get past them to go to the ladies room.  We go to Flemings, Maestros, Dominicks all the time and wanted to try something new to us............NEVER again.

Amazing atmosphere, fantastic menu and wine/beer/cocktail selection.  We had the Pumpkin Soup (superb) and salmon salad and pizza with the apple fritters for dessert.  So jazzed to have a great American rest in the area.  Shocking how poorly run the service staff were.....they were indifferent, borderline snotty and inefficient. Had to ask for utensils, salt and pepper, water, drinks etc.  We asked for parm cheese for the pizza and the waitress actually brought us an empty cheese clear shaker.  We ate dinner at 8pm and even though the rest was half full, the young wait staff were breaking down everything for the night.  When we left we literally had to walk past the chef, manager and lead waitstaff having a meeting at the exit area and no one said goodbye, thank you, hope you enjoyed your meal etc.  I had to say thank you to them and they looked annoyed to be interrupted.  To make it in this town you have to have more than great food and atmosphere........Service, Service, Service ( and I am not talking fawning/fake/over attentive service.....I am talking decent hello, thank you and caring about the customer vs hiring young and beautiful people type service.)

Great consignment store.  The owner is very friendly and helpful; but not pushy.  She has a fashion eye with her merchandise.  Lots of designer or name brand items.  Fabulous selection of designer purses.  If anything, she needs more space especially for her shoes.  Worth the visit.
