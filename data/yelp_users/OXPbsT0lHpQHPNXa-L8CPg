Service sucks!  Walked in and was seated immediately.  Sat for 10 min and was never greeted by a waitress.   Walked out and went elsewhere.

Went here on a Monday night for dinner and drinks.  We arrived in time for happy hour, so took advantage of the prices and ordered a Redneck Cocktail and a couple of apps.  The J.I.M.B.O. was good and served in a mason jar glass.  It didn't taste like there was any alcohol in it, so switched to a beer when it was gone.  The Chips and Dip were delicious!  We also tried the Corn Dogs...expected to receive mini corn dogs, but there were 3 actual corn dogs on the plate with 2 types of mustard and ketchup.  They were really good!  For dinner I had the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup.  The Grilled Cheese had 3 different cheeses (American, Provolone and Goat) and I ordered the candied bacon for an additional charge.  Totally worth it!  The soup was tasty...not a plain tomato, but a creamy tomato soup with some cheese on top.  My dining companion ordered the Bad Ass Bloody and the Strawberry Shortcake for dinner.  The Bloody was served with a slider on top.  It's a great concept, but the drink had an over abundance of celery salt in it and wasn't finished.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience.  It's nice place.  I would have preferred to sit at one of the booths...they have taps on the table that I would have liked to try out!  I would definitely go back.
