Nothing quite like hearing the owner Brett reprimanding his employees infront of guests and employees. Shame on you sir, be more professional.

All right guys and gals here is my review. First of all this place treats you like family they remember my name and my drink and always genuinely ask how I am and about myself and aren't afraid to tell me about their lives. It's nice to come here to get away to a different life. Here's what really gets me the cooks especially Victor is great!! His burgers are amazing!! Also guess what I work at a burger joint "yumm" and his are like I said amazing! He is always happy to meet a guest that is happy with his food. John is the owner you can usually point him out with his happy strut.
