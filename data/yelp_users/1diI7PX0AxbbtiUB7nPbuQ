Outstanding coffee and incredibly sweet earth child barista (don't think I'm allowed to say "hippy chick").  And the first time I had their iced mocha (I think triple shot espresso) I exclaimed "wow, that's damn fine coffee".  Wish it wasn't 20 miles from my house!  They need to get a new couch or two in there.   But the coffee was so damn good I'd forgive them anything.

I'm told this is one of the nicest Food City locations.  Where else can you get a bag of pastillera for a few dollars?  Instead of several dollars each at AJ's.  Love the selection of mexican food stuffs.  $15 Jimador  with a nice glass was a nice bonus find.

Terminal 4 has really upped their game in the restaurant department.  A dozen of the valley's trendier places now have locations in the terminal.  And some of them are even on the other side of security!

CPK catered our playgroup event, and what a terrific job they did!  Their people were charming and all the food was delicious, especially the linguine, the Thai chicken pizzas, and the wild field greens salad with candied nuts.

We've been taking my twins here since they started walking and gone to more birthday parties here than I can count.  Love the train ride, especially when they have the Christmas display.  Pretty good playground.  Ice cream shop is a good deal for the kids, huge scoop on sugar cone for $1.50.  Not as yummy as Churn, but at 1/3 the price it is just fine for the kiddos.

Was 5 stars, now is (merely) 4 stars.  Which means it is still a damned sight better than most other places.  I go here about once a week for over a decade now.  Salads are the stars though sandwiches and baked goods are great too.  They regularly revise their menu which is great when they add some terrific new item but frustrating when that great new item falls of the menu again a few months later.

Damn that green flannel is great.  It has corn beef, potatoes, fresh jalapenos, and green peppers.  Even something normally as pedestrian as english muffins are great  (tip, make yourself a flannel english muffin sandwich).   Food is terrific and so are the folks.  My wife has dreams about their monkey cakes which are banana/almond/coconut pancakes.  Our twins consume the heroically large pancakes too.

Great little local pizzeria, popular place.  It is casual and inexpensive.  Pizza slices seem to be made to order, instead of throwing items atop a slice and re-heating it like other places.  My 5 year old says "It is SO Yummy, it's delicious!" and I must agree.  He inhaled his cheese slice faster than I've ever seen him eat a pizza before.

Dinner has always been terrific.  Been here a 1/2 dozen times.  Always have a good time at dinner.  Happy hour thought?  Had a puzzling poor happy hour experience, drinks and food weren't good.  Can't figure out if it was an off day or they just phone it in during happy hour.

This has always been my favorite Pita Jungle.  We've been coming here for almost a decade and it has been pretty much consistently great for all that time.  I love the shawarma wrap, black bean burger, and stuffed grape leaves.  While we were eating outside a little bird is snatching sugar packets off table.  But only "Sugar In The Raw", not the fake or white packets.  Quite a discerning little critter :-)

Gross.  Wife didn't even bother to take left-overs.  Place does not look clean.  A warning sign for us should have been that this "mexican" place is staffed with gringo servers.  Every quesadilla we ordered arrived soggy, not a single item we ordered was crisp.   Margarita was one of the worst we've had in the north valley (which is really saying something).  Kids seats had broken seat belts.  All of this is sad because we had high hopes for this place especially after reading the positive reviews.  Not mexican, but infinitely better is Mi Comida at 43rd Ave & Bell.

Got hungry for a taco while driving back from the Covalent surfboard factory by the Mesa Gateway airport.  Yelp suggested Rudy's.  I tried and loved the California Burrito which is terrific carne asada with potatoes, peppers and other stuff.  I had them roll it with the red hot sauce already in to make it easier to eat on the go.  Rudy had a steady flow of customers while I was there mid-afternoon so must be popular with locals.  Fairly nice inside for a taqueria.  Looks like it was a new take-out pizza place that went out of business and then Rudy took it over.  I'm sure this is a huge improvement over the previous tenant :-)

Returned from long vacation to find one of our Lennox central air units wasn't blowing any air, despite me being able to hear the blower motor.  Called them to schedule a service call to replace the blower.  Kevin asked some questions then instructed me to check outside for ice on the compressor line.  Sure enough, there was a grapefruit sized glossy snowball of ice on the line despite it being 100 degrees out.  Kevin said I don't need a service visit to get it running again.  Told me there's probably 6" of ice on the coils inside the air handler so I merely needed to turn it off for 3 hours, then turn the fan from auto to on for 30 minutes and everything will be fine.  He was right, it was.  Kevin explained that it froze up with the storms we've had here and the sudden rise in humidity.  That a contributing factor was my too restrictive & dirty air filter from Home Depot.  And / or that I might be low on coolant.  He also explained what kind of filter to get instead of the ones we had been using.  I had Kevin out a week later as a follow-up and recharged the coolant which was low.  So, we'll be using Kevin from now on for all of our service & repairs.  Will give him our business too when it is time to replace our 15 year old systems!

Super nice, love the intimate vibe and smaller than Scottsdale setting.  Nice simple food.  It was a 5 stars for my first visit.  Really nice folks, and a complete lack of douches and gold diggers.  Not perfect though.  On my 2nd visit brought my wife along on her birthday for their Friday the 13th party.  Fun event with major issues though like the paid wine tasting finishes at 8PM (which they didn't tell us) and they'd lost their cook that day so it took 90 minutes to get a minuscule flatbread.  So we had to go to Carefree Station to get a 2nd dinner.  Lesson is don't expect to eat there during their big parties, especially if their cook is MIA.

My favorite is still the one on Shea but this is also great.  Kids meal can't be beat.  Fattoush Salad is great, so is the black bean burger (just add Sriracha).  Tapas portions at happy hour look great, but we always forget about that until after we've already ordered.

Great little place, very nice folks.  Fresh bagels every morning from her cousin's bakery.  I love my scrambled egg & feta with lettuce, tomato and diced pepperoncini on toasted everything bagel with my iced coffee (ok, actually I never make it out of there without having a 2nd iced coffee).  5 stars for being within walking distance of my house at Dynamite & Alma School.  My morning ritual has become walk 2 miles there, breakfast then walk home in time for work.  Wished it opened a bit earlier than 7AM.  update 3/2/2013 - new owners, new menu and furniture.  breakfast and baked goods look quite good but no longer has an espresso machine :-(   Will write an updated review once I've had more than just a coffee.

I don't usually both rating a fast food place.  But this was the nicest McDonald's I've seen in the US.  Nicest ever was McCafé in Brisbane where the waiter brings fresh chocolate croissants and espressos on fine china to your table.  So this isn''t the nicest ever but is still heads & shoulders above the others in town.  This location makes our local Starbucks look dumpy in comparison.  Check my photos.  Modern design throughout with a café lounging area, touch screen video game corner for the tykes, pub tables, high-backed booths for privacy, blown glass sculptures and a chandelier.   Didn't use the restroom but would hazard a guess it is probably gorgeous as well.  Double lane drive-through jammed up at evening rush hour makes for a busy bee kitchen.  Folks were hustling hard.  Gotthe kids meals quickly.   And the wraps were a bit better stuffed than some of the other locations that really gyp you if you order them with grilled chicken.  My only regret was forgetting to order a coffee while I was there.

So unexpected, so fun, so yummy!  The venue is a huge space.  Retro w/o being trying too hard.  Loved having a DJ spinning motown.  I'm struggling to think of a place in town with drinks as terrific as these.  All are made from scratch as each drink is made.  Fruit cut, oranges squeezed on a per drink basis.  And the sliders are a treat, especially the brisket.    We were there on a slower night and still had a blast.  I'd love to see what it is like when it is really hopping.  Can't think of a better place to take a big crew.

At least you have those comfy leather chairs to hang out and chat.  Oops, you removed all of those and packed the place with really uncomfortable wooden ones instead.  Thank goodness your baristas are all really nice helpful folks.  Oops, those folks left and were replaced with hipster kids that seem slightly annoyed to be waiting on you.

Could not be happier with my first visit there with my twins today.  Marina is as nice as can be.  Place charming though small.  But the porch seating is the place to be.  Crepes and coffee are the main attraction.  But my twins thought Marina's scrambled eggs were the best ever, in fact they even put away a 2nd order.  Nice menu of savory crepes and a 2nd menu of sweet ones.  Didn't get to try a savory one but saw many coming out that looked and smelled terrific.  Did try my twin's bananas foster crepes and loved them.  Cafe americano with a bit of skim was so good that I had two.  Zoom zoom :-)

Went for pop-up charity sale event.  So not yet had the full-on nightlife experience.    The space is very nice and the food is shockingly nicer done for a bar.  We had the wasabi slider and soy/wasabi chicken. Both were excellent! (color me surprised). The chicken was perfectly marinated and wood grilled, doesn't even need the dip.  The slider was terrific as well though surprising with a dim sum steamed bun style bread.

Amazing flan, great food, cheap tasty drinks.  Color me pleased.  During happy hour until 7PM or all day Sunday it is $3 for a top shelf mojito in Scottsdale, and $5.50 for 5 street tacos.  Seriously, what is better than that?  An early reviewer said expensive, but compared to what? Taco Bell drive thru?

Nice store, well organized and lots of light because of the huge windows.  As opposed to most consignment stores which are cluttered and frankly can be a bit gross.  The items look new or little used especially the shoes which appear to be brand-new.  Good selection of clothes, toys, a few kids bicycles and tricycles and lots of bicycle stroller / trailers.  I have twins so really appreciate a place where I can get nice stuff for less than retail.

Probably 4 stars on a normal day but I had such a blast at the Yelp charity brunch they hosted.  Pancakes are genuinely terrific.

Gorgeous cars, serious engineering goes into those.  Is like buying a car at the apple store.  Staff are pretty knowledgeable.

Had a lot of fun at the bar chatting w Trent and having great drinks and food!  Marisa loved the Moscato d' Asti.  Orecchiette was really terrific w rapini, chiles and sausage.  Wow!  Loved dessert too, had the chocolate budino with homemade marshmallow meringue and biscotti crust

Love everything I've had here.  Marisa is a fan too.  Kafta and gyros are great, fresh-cut fries also terrific.  Table service instead of queuing at the counter.  I'll be trying the baklava after I'm down a few pounds.  Today I had the chicken shawarma and ask Tamer to put a little hummus it too. It was really outstanding and Panini press as well which was nice surprise perfect crisp crunchy texture on the outside everything inside terrific, it even has slivers of pickled radishes in it that are great.  And as an extra bonus they have stupid fast free Wi-Fi here 38Mbs.  The brother owners Tamer & Mohammed are doing a great job.  btw, my chicken shawarma looked so yummy that I would have taken a picture for yelp.  But I devoured it instead :-(  update 1/3/12, joy of joys, they have beef shawarma today!  It too was terrific.  Wi-Fi is still stupid fast at 29Mbs down / 39Mbs up unlike the Starbucks that I just came from.

Yes, it is that good!  Pizza was very good the second time though not as spectacular the first visit. I think the kitchen got rushed. But all is forgiven, Everything else is perfect. Love the chop salad. Great beer. Great wine.  Gorgeous date.

I just caught the tail end of this event but enjoyed it.  My wife Marisa did every participating shop.  Some like Michael did every shop and even a dozen that weren't :-)

Love the airing of the grievances.   And the dozen food trucks too.  Beer garden doesn't hurt either.  It is basically just a more festive version of the Saturday market done at night with more food and drinking.  But that's not a bad thing :-)   btw, yes Short Leash Dog is terrific, but is it 2 dozen people in line terrific when there's a bunch of other great food trucks with no lines right next to it?  I especially love Aji Mobile's El Gaucho sandwich with chimichurri.

Muy bueno!  Damn the salsa is hot though!  Deserts look really yummy, very moist cake, getting one to go. update:  had the cake when we got home, it was fantastic!  Seriously pissed the wife off though when I questioned how much of it she was eating.

Really nice place, menu is great!  Definitely worth visiting.  Some dishes were good but not terrific, maybe it was just an off day?  I'd say between 3 and 4 stars.  Place has the potential to be solid 4 or even move into 5 territory.

My menu had food stuck to it, so the hostess stood there at my table scrapping it off with her fingernail instead of just grabbing a clean menu.  And the food she scrapped off the menu was left on the table right in front of me until she came back many minutes later with my tea.  I'm not a neat freak but that was gross.  Only had some yakisoba which was pretty good.  Can't comment on their other dishes.

Stopped in instead of fighting 5pm traffic.  Nice place and happy hour specials makes it very happy indeed.  I think Gallo Blanco is bit better which puzzles me since it is the same people.

This place would be slammed busy if it were in CenPho.  It is a great dinner with lots of yummy things for breakfast and lunch.  My favorite is the breakfast burrito.  btw, Milk Shake Mondays!  $2 all day.  I've not had one yet but they look great.

Really nice for such a casual place.  Nice folks too.  Food was quite good.  Not Good Fellas fantastic but then again it isn't 20 miles away either.

Oh wow!  Choco tres leches.  Brought 1/2 dozen buddies with me and we all had a blast, everyone was impressed.  Each dish was better than the last.  We'll definitely be back next month.

Went with a bunch of Yelp friends, had a great time.  Hamburger was great, nice beer selection.   Lively atmosphere despite being a Tuesday, it was really busy.  Can't beat the $10 burger + beer deal.  Easy 5 stars except that on this evening the service was slower than the 2nd coming of Jesus, I think there was 1 lady serving every table in the place.

Oh, now I get it!  Chipotle style assembly with a wood fired oven and Pei Wei interior.  And they have beer & wine.  Neat!  Pizza was excellent, toppings were great.  Nice thin crust pizza, artfully made with everything in the right proportions.  Crisp thin crust, singe around the edges.

Picked up a couple $49 doorbuster nightstands on Black Friday.  Really nice units that'd otherwise be more than $100.   They have a lot of great furniture here.  I especially like the kids split-level bunk beds and the coffee tables with rising tops.

Twisted Rose's pulled pork is best thing here!  Shout outs to Brat Haus and Deseo.  And a lot of places bringing their A-Game.  Z-Tejas citrus lime ahi, North, Sassi, many others.  Even Orange Sky has something great.  Taggia at Foresky has amazing gnocchi w pork.  And Pietini's apple cobbler is a treat.  Oh, Oh, Campfire Grill @Tom Thumb is here!!! I'm in  bbq pulled pork taco heaven now!  If they'd brought their bourbon pecan pie then I could die happy right now!  Honorable mention: Hyatt Regency's chocolate tarts.  I ate 3

Such a fan, 10x better than any fox concept.  Greg is a great host, and it is such an inviting cozy place you have trouble believing it has only been around for weeks and not decades.

I was thrilled that a potentially great mexican restaurant moved in near me.  Just wished it turned out to be more thrilling.  Had problems with service, completely inflexible.  Kitchen managed to muck up a basic of quesadilla order.  Server was incredulous that we might want that fixed.  And she questioned what a quesadilla should be, tried to take the kids menu from my 5 year old boy so she could read & verify WHILE he was coloring it with crayons.  Couldn't she just get herself  another menu?  They really need better servers.  And it was pretty expensive for a lunch time meal that was really just mediocre.

Being a Fox Concept, we assumed it'd be competent though maybe not exceptional.  We were floored by how absolutely terrific the place, food and service proved to be.  This is an experience very different than typical Fox.  Korean skirt steak with tempura green beans atop curry rice is not to be missed.  Tried the wife's roasted tomato black bean chili which was terrific as well, though the Korean skirt steak is in a whole other league.  Club house margarita was terrific.  Mule was good, thought I'd suggest it needs more ginger beer since the lime overpowered a bit.  Croissant bread pudding was very yummy, didn't leave one bit of that.  The space is really terrific, quite refined w/o being stuff.  Will be back to try their coffee shop and breakfast too.  btw, might suggest reservations.  You might have a long wait if not unless you get a seat at the bar.  Lounge area is very nice, comfortable couches and chairs so that's a pleasant place to hang out with a drink and appetizer.

Big fan of Fired Pie and the separated at birth MyPie.  I'm glad Fired just opened one 15 miles closer to us.  Lots of great toppings and crisp lavosh style crust.

Of all the Vigs, I like this one best :-)  The others are solid 4s so I guess that'd make this one a 5.  Daily flatbreads are great.  Hot Habby is a great habanero margarita.  Chris behind the bar is quite amiable.  We came hear for dinner with friends and had a great time.  I visited more recently during happy hour, nice food specials.

Lucky to have this place!  Locally sourced, unpretentious and yummy.  My kids consume the burgers and dogs in record time.  Marisa and I love ours too.  She always gets the Paris Texas Red Yam Fries.  I get the great waffle fries.  Hamburger is marinated 24 hours in red wine.  Toppings are great, be sure to ask for grilled onions.  Never new red chili paste can really make a burger.  The mayonnaise-free slaw is great by itself or as a topping.  I'm sure to lose my Duke status after others discover it.

Many places have macarons but just about none are as good as these. Terrific gelato too. These folks are a really nice french couple making the tastiest things in the valley. I'll be trying their croissants next.

Is there a rating lower than one star? They had issues when it used to be Danny's but now it's 10 times worse. Came here to get a car wash today full-service and waited and waited and waited and everybody was hanging out around the computer chitchatting nobody would come take my car wash order and when I went inside they couldn't even find a manager. What a waste of time this place is.

Q: So why did you open a donut shop? A: "Because I love donuts and there weren't good ones here in our neighborhood"  that is pretty hard to argue with :-) Lisa makes an amazing donut and runs a great shop. Brought the kids here and they consumed one of everything. And Lisa is so charming. Definitely a happy place to come in the morning. Marisa and I don't think twice about driving 40 miles round trip to here in the morning. Opens at 4:30am too

Terrific place, a great upgrade for this location :-) Yummy bruschetta and $12 wines are $6 during happy hour. Loved my bruschetta board with shrimp/avocado, eggplant/mozzarella, prosciutto. Will be back soon and often.
