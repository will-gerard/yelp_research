Wish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!

Loved this mall back in the day. Nothing wrong with it today if people would shop there. Great central location and lots of good places to eat.

I love McAlister's Deli and it's great to have one nearby. The kids meals are only 99 cents every day, which means my family, which includes four kids, can eat here for under $20! The food is delicious, the sweet tea is the best in town, and it has a great lunch atmosphere for casual or business lunches. Highly recommended.
