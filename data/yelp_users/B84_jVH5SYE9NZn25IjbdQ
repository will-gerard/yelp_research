Wow!!! I just took a spinning class from Ty and it was great! I had a knee replacement 10 years ago and have not been able to run since. I have done other cardio workouts but nothing compared to running. This class gave me that 'runner's high' I so enjoy. Ty is a sweetheart and very motivating. She uses a terrific mix of music too.

Meh.  There's so much better food and service out there in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  We tried this place again, only to be disappointed by the small portions and very poor service.  Our third time here was not a charm!

Terrible customer service. Enter store, go to Ipod location. Employee Nick looks at me.  Says nothing. I say I need an Ipod Classic. He tilts head toward his microphone and calls for a key to open the case. Opens case, removes Ipod, nods toward cash register. Asks if I am part of some rewards program (he mumbled so I'm not sure what program he was asking about) Rings up sale.  Tells me the amount. I pay.  He pushes item towards me then says 'Do you want a bag?' I wait for him to say thank you. . . not happening, he never says another word.   I say 'You're welcome' End of transaction.  Hello Fry's Electronics!

I really enjoy this place. My husband is big into handicapping the ponies so we head to the track a couple of times a month. If you are in a kick back mood, grab your lawn chairs, buy a beer and head out to the grassy area to watch the races. Or you can go to the grandstands with beer in hand and people watch. The folks that attend are quite varied. Everyone from the Red Hat Clubs, well heeled guys and dolls, twenty -something party friends and the guy who resembles the bum on the corner (will work for betting cash?)   I truly enjoy lunch at the Turf Club. The food is very good. The lettuce wraps are crunchy and tasty. I think that the tuna melt is the best I've ever had. The Texas toast bread is toasted perfectly, the tuna mixture is warm and comforting. The fries are OK. My husband likes the sliders. Tap beer is surprisingly inexpensive $4 for Heffie.   The Turf Club is where you go and see some of those better dressed folks and the rest of Turf Paradise is all about society's melting pot. Fun spot!

Step back into the 1990s and enjoy a workout! Nice clean facility. Equipment sort of jammed in at odd angles (in the large weight/cardio room) but its good stuff. Not sure the purpose of two weight rooms. I think the club is more tennis based yet they have do have group exercise classes, racquetball courts and a pool.   I think the spinning room may have been a children's nursery at one time based on the wall graphics, the black light effect is unique. If this were my club I'd place the emphasis on spinning classes and convert the smaller weight room into a spinning studio.   Dropped a star because the women's locker room doesn't have a sauna.   Very friendly employees! I am so glad to be greeted with a smile when walking in the door. Everyone on the staff is friendly. Quaint club. . . in a good way.

I am so happy with my skin! I had microbrasion and a peel from Jennifer and the results are wonderful. Jennifer is very personable and took her time explaining what she thought would be the best skin procedure for me. She is a true professional.

Raffles has terrible customer service. Just rolled into Vegas, checked into Mandalay and hungry. First restaurant we see and approach (first mistake). Hostess is obviously pissed off that we would want to be seated. We're curtly told that it will be a few minutes. . .hmm. . .the place is nearly empty. Get seated, menus tossed at us then . . .wait for it. . . we became invisible! Amazing! I've always wanted that power and now I've got it at a time when I am extremely hungry. Sat, sat, sat, sat, sat, sat, sat, ad nauseam. We took our souls elsewhere.  And I am not lying about being invisible because no one even noticed when we left!!

I want the old Fry's back!! something has changed in transition. My husband and I have shopped at Fry's for more than 13 years. We'd even go out of our way to shop here but no more.   Our main complaint is the customer service (or lack of). The friendly, helpful staff has disappeared. Where did they go? Who brought in the second stringers from AJ's? Grumpy is not attractive. Though I must give the Sushi folks credit for enthusiasm and free samples.    The layout of the bakery and deli departments is so crowded we avoid that area completely. The aisles seem more narrow than before.   We now hit up Albertson's, Bashas and Costco.I am sad to lose my good old Fry's!!  We'll pop in once and awhile to see if by chance things change.

I am appalled that you would publish a customer's phone number and address. This obviously shows your lack of professionalism. You just shot yourself in the foot because no one in their right mind would use your services after you posted a customer's information because you were angry. Wow!

Really bad customer service. Grouchy employees.  We had a coupon for a discount on services and my husband had to argue with them in order for them to honor it.  I've been in a couple of times and the older man who works there acted as if he was doing me a tremendous favor by waiting on me. The lady who works there told me that the closest place to send FedEx was at Tatum and Shea.  Well there is a place right across the street on the  NW corner of 32 street and Shea called Ship and Post (they handle both FedEx and UPS).  My husband and I own our own business and we will be using Ship and Post from now on.  The fellow there is very friendly and efficient. Too bad UPS Store, we were using you for most of our business needs.

Very good chicken salad sandwich! Maybe yogurt in the mix? Will return. Also, the bartender and manager were very friendly. Cool spot!

I may very well have the happiest digits in Phoenix.  Sundrops Nail Spot is fabulous!  Read Gabbi's review for all the details.  I had the cherry blossom mani/pedi, simply wonderful.  Kelly did a great job. I'm never going to one of those "in and out places" again!

Superb customer service! I went in to have spinning cleats put on my shoes. . . the gal (sorry don't know her name) who helped me was so courteous and helpful. I'll take all my cycling needs here.

We've had great experiences here.  One of our dogs became very ill and had to be put down.  The whole staff was very kind and sympathetic.    Another time our puppy bit into a small cactus.  Our puppy had to be put to sleep while the vet pulled out all of the barbs.  I was so impressed with the time they took with our dog and with us as to the followup instructions.  I read the other reviews and am wondering if we are in different dimensions of realty.    Also, there is clinic next door that does low cost spay and neutering.  The day we took our dogs in a lady was bringing in feral cats to be fixed.  I was told that the vet does this service for free.  Cool!!

My husband and I took in some jewelry to Eric. He gave us a quote and even suggested we get a few other quotes before buying.  We thought the offer was a good one and left with a check. I like the fact that he only buys jewelry, this way he can give a fair price (since he doesn't have the overhead of store merchandise). And he's a pleasant guy to deal with.

I received a wonderful massage from Mary.  In fact, I purchased a membership.  That sums up my experience.

My husband and I had a wonderful stay. We upgraded to a suite during check in and it was worth the extra expense. Our balcony overlooked the golf course and we had a 3/4 panoramic view of the surrounding mountains. We ordered room service, I had the short rib burger, delicious, My husband had a spicy Chinese pork dish which was excellent. The carrot cake was just so-so but the chocolate fudge cake was yummy. The ice cream was very, very good. The room was spacious, the appointments were very nice, I especially liked the Native American motif.  Comfortable bed, huge rain shower and nice balcony chairs. We didn't spend time by the pool, there was a young crowd enjoying a party atmosphere and it sure looked like fun. If I were twenty five years younger I would have joined them. I spent a couple of hours in the casino and I was impressed by the friendliness of the casino/hotel staff. Overall it was a terrific experience.

I am writing this for my son and husband.  They don't have Yelp accounts so I am yelping for them.    My husband had a sandwich that he said was delicious.  He even noticed how cool the place is!  This is saying something, from a guy who rarely notices his surroundings when chowing down.  My son walks to 32 a few times per week.  He's really into good coffee and claims this is the best!  Loves the outdoor seating and the fact dogs are allowed.  Yay!  There you have it, a review from a couple of my loved ones.  You can bet I'll be going there soon.

Do not use this company to tow your car. My husband called to have our car towed and told them he would present our AAA card to them for payment.  They towed the car to the dealership and then informed us that the bill would be $147.00. When my husband reminded them that we were using triple A they then informed him that they don't accept AAA. Funny how they didn't let him know that when he made the appointment. Scammers!

Oh my. . . oh my!! I love my Valentine's Day flowers from Enchanted Florist! Candy too. Tulips, roses and some sort of white blossoms that are simply gorgeous. The vase is a keeper too. My husband did very well in choosing this florist.
