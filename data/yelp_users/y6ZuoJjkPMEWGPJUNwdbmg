Came here in the afternoon with a friend and definitely regret choosing this place. Staff is not friendly at all and we waited over 20 minutes just to have some one take our drink order. The person that finally takes our drink order places the silver ware on a napkin and practically throws it on the table. Just flat out rude. She brought or drinks and I asked her for straws 3 times and she finally  gave them to me... Again throwing them on my table...definitely not coming this place again!

Landed at this place because it was the only thing still open that wasn't on the strip... I was visiting from out of town on Memorial Day weekend with my best friend and I'm a huge fan of Italian food but wasn't expecting much since it was almost 2am and I was just flat out hungry. Man oh man was i impressed!! This place was AMAZING I loved everything about it. The service was awesome, the atmosphere was so relaxing and stunning. The furniture, decor, music and lighting was spot on perfection. Then finally we received the food, one word WOW! I couldn't have asked for a better place to go to and I was truly impressed and taken back at how truly amazing this place was. I can't wait to go back! It was truly amazing!

Awesome staff and delicious food! The price was perfect! My friend and I came to have an early dinner and they were super busy but the service was so quick as soon as we sat down after ordering they brought my salad out. The pizza took awhile since they have a wood brick oven but it was well worth the wait! This place is amazing but what really puts it over the rest is their awesome customer service. There was these twins working at the counter and on the floor that were so attentive and super nice! And I think the manager was the one who checked up on us and asked how things were going but this is place was awesome definitely going back

I had the best experience here with my family. The food was delicious but what really made my visit was our server Chris. He was hands down the best server I've ever had. He was very patient and attentive. The BEST customer service ever! I wish every server was as awesome as he is! Awesome place and awesome staff! 5 stars all the way!

Best pizza EVER I'm a huge pizza lover and this place is the best. Their pizza is no comparison to any other pizza I've tasted. I also tried their appetizer it was bread with melted cheese idk what it was called but it was amazing!!!! And my awesome waiter convinced me to try their cannoli and man it was soooo good and I'm not a fan of chocolate (shocker, I know) but it was so good and I paired it with their vanilla gelato and I left their extremely satisfied. Not only was the food amazing but our server Brandon was phenomenal I can't wait to go back!
