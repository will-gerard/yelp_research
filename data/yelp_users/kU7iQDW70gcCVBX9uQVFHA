Was happy to hear BWW re-opened at this location in Glendale.  We met several friends there to watch a football game and enjoy some food.  It was ok.  The service was slow, had to keep asking people for refills, food was average.    We/ve always like the wings at BWW so those were good, I tried fried pickles for the first time and enjoyed them.  They brought the wrong order for 3 people in our party of 7.  Waitress gave my hubby a beer, he took a sip from it and told her it wasn't Blue Moon (like he ordered).  She said "Oh, it's a Michelob Utra!" They proceeded to ask a couple of other waitresses nearby if they were waiting on an Ultra.  She went to hand the beer to another waitress (to give to another patron).  I practically jumped out of my seat and stopped her...I told her AGAIN, my husband took a sip of it and realized it wasn't Blue Moon...you can't give it to that person!  She gave me a glare and told my husband he shouldn't have sipped from it if he didn't plan on drinking it.    I told her that she brought him the WRONG BEER....I told manager on duty what happened, between the beer, waitress trying to give to another patron after sip was taken, orders messed up with 3 at our table, etc.  We were not happy with this visit AT ALL.

Wow! Was going to write a thorough review and it was not a positive one, sad to say.  I guess they saw it coming; I drove by and see THE BUILDING HAD BEEN TORN DOWN at this location....(In Surprise, W. Bell Road)

My husband and I have been looking for a great Chinese restaurant, and our local search is OVER!  We went out on a date night, had heard of Big Buddha in passing, checked out reviews and decided to give it a try.  WELL...we arrived at 830 pm they close at 9 pm).  We were greeted right away in a friendly manner, we were shown to a table and service was AWESOME, QUICK and FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND TASTED FRESH!  We had a wonderful meal, were NOT rushed by staff, everyone was super nice and we ended up having a great evening.  Price was very fair as well!  We had eggrolls, beef skewers, egg drop soup, fried rice, beef and broccoli, orange chicken for (2) and everything was delicious and hot.  Meal came out to only $36....considering we had a beer, soda and everything I mentioned...GREAT VALUE!   If you want good Chinese Food in Surprise, I agree with Floyd C...WE FOUND IT!

We were looking for GOOD NY-style pizza and great wings.  We found both at Lucky's Pizza!  It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.  Their pizza, calzone, and wings are awesome!  We love the delicious and fresh pizza with great quality ingredients.  Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!  We are "regulars" there and are never disappointed!  We are definitely fans and feed our family of 6 (with leftovers)...very filling and tasty.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!    (Delivery would make it PERFECT, but it's WORTH the drive...about 10 minutes each way....we pass by (4) other pizza joints on the way so I hope that's saying ALOT!)

Husband and I stopped by for lunch one day on a whim. We were hungry, saw it driving by and popped in.  We were greeted ad soon as we walked in.  Never been here before. First impression, clean, attractive spacious.  Plenty of tvs.  Set up seems to be comparable to other "Sports bars/eateries."  Sat in a booth--comfortable, waitress was polite.  Ordered wings and fries, couple of sodas.  It was all ok. Wings were nice and big, decent taste, but not necessarily "better" then what we've had elsewhere.  Took awhile to get our orders although it didn't seem overly busy (we went to late lunch around 1400, had to flag waitress down for refills.)    Food was mediocre, overpriced.  Service was mediocre (slow service, minimal followup) Not impressed, it "filled the hole."  It wasn't terrible, but easn't memorable either. Might try again if in the area to keep it real....might have been an "off" day.   As of now, with so many other good eateries out there, not enough to make us "crave" it to come back.....

We love this Sam's Club.  It is well lit, well organized, well stocked and clean.  Employees (in our experience) have always been friendly and helpful.  It is a pleasure shopping at this Sam's.  We find everything we need (and then some), prices are great ....what you expect at Sam's.  Their produce is exceptional quality and they have a great variety and selection of items.  Their eatery inside is pretty good.  Great prices (you can get a large slice of pizza and a large drink combo fro $2.59)  They also offer Nathan's hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, churros and ice cream sundae with berries (delicious).  Parking is plentiful, wish it was better lit for night shopping, but otherwise just fine.  We are so happy this Sam's is here in Surprise! It is conveniently located off 303 and Bell.  We visit so much we know some of the regular employees by name.  Always a pleasure!  Definitely WORTH checking out and shopping if you live in/near Surprise!     TIP:  You can buy a pizza there uncooked and they will cook it for you to take home freshly baked!

Great experience. Restaurant was clean, nice size.  Plenty of parking, well located, parking lot clean.  The staff was polite, friendly and great customer service.  The food was hot, tasted fresh and received pretty quickly.  Good portions.  Don't hit fried chicken for fast food very much, but this KFC made me glad I did!

I've looking for almost a year now for a great spot to get manicures/pedicures.  I FOUND IT!  Am very impressed with my experiences at 8 Pretty Nails.   Have been here (3) times, alone, with GF, and with teenage daughter.  The employees are polite and professional.  It is very clean and attractive.  They have spa liners which they replace after each customer.  They have new instruments in package for each customer.    Great, relaxing experience each time. Great job and manicures and pedicures, usually last 2 weeks.  LOVE THIS LITTLE GEM IN SURPRISE for pampering!  My nail technician is Angie: SUPER!

This is our "go-to" dry cleaners.  Very close by, near Dunkin Donuts so we "kill 2 birds with one stone" and grab a Vanilla Chai and donuts and pick up dry cleaning.    This dry cleaner has fair prices and been consistent on times promised for pick up.  Employees have been polite and helpful, store is clean and well lit.  Been happy with service consistently.  Any garment dry cleaned and pressed for $2.50!

Just discovered this place.  It's right up the street from the Northeast library in Surprise.  Had a bit of a challenge finding it, not well marked.  Look for a chalkboard sign right across from the tennis courts.    At first glance there didn't seem to be much to it.  A counter with large chalkboards with specials and LOTS of menu items.  There was an adjoining area and outside seating that was clean and quite comfortable.  They had tv and free wifi.   Nice casual place, saw people with Laptops and books chillin' having lunch and/reading a book having a coffee or smoothie.  We looked at menu and picked (2) lunch plates that sounded good.  I had the Chicken Buffalo dip sandwich with coleslaw, daughter had Turkey Avocado sandwich with potato salad.  We BOTH really loved our lunch!  Nice portion, excellent taste!  SO PLEASED!  They have lots of coffee drinks, milkshakes, smoothies, will have to come back for those!  They don't offer burgers or fries, but that's ok, there are plenty of burger joints around.  I understand they do catering as well....  Will definitely be back!  When I complimented the ladies at the counter for a wonderful lunch, they told me Fat Freddy's will probably be closing FOR GOOD in December.  Business has been super slow......my guess is because it's kinda tricky to find.  They mentioned they weren't allowed to put real signage along the street (Paradise Lane) next to Surprise Civic Center.  BUMMER......  THIS PLACE WOULD BE A GREAT KEEPER for our town!   If they can get business poppin' maybe we can keep them open!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Been to 1 Brothers (3) times hoping it would get better.  It is in a great location for us, next to Frys and about 2 minutes from our house.    It's definitely average.  There is nothing special about the pizza or the wings.  Not bad, but nothing to look forward to.  The restaurant is clean, plenty of seating with tvs strategically located.  There has been a rude lady at the register/counter each time we've gone.  Not sure if that's "just how she is," but we expect SOME kind of positive customer service.  She was talking on the phone (2) times we were there and waited to end her conversation before acknowledging us.    There has always been one guy in back cooking (in my experience) and he was also the one that brought our pizza out to us.  There is limited parking directly in front, but it is in the mini strip mall area at Prasada Frys Marketplace, so you can park close enough.  It's never crowded, but not a surprise, its not that good!  Would be "ok" if you want to "fill the hole" are in the mood for pizza to grab a couple slices, but definitely NOT what we look to for family pizza night out or even "to go."  They don't offer delivery, but their pizza and service is average, so wouldn't ask for it anyway.  Such a shame, we TRIED to make it OUR PIZZA JOINT!  We go 10 minutes out of our way to pick up Lucky's Pizza......PERFECTION if you're looking for delicious, New York-style pizza with fresh ingredients.  (See my Lucky's review ;)

I love this Fry's Marketplace!  Have not been disappointed at all in my experience here.  Have been shopping there for almost a year now.  It is conveniently located in Surprise with plenty of parking.  There is a Starbucks counter inside and you can get a special-order sub at the deli.  We lived in Okinawa for awhile and had been missing California rolls and Spicy rolls.  They make them fresh there near the cheese section.  They often have samples available, and it always good.  Produce has had decent selection (not the best, but pretty good).  There is an ATM and small satellite bank and pharmacy inside as well.    It is a great one-stop shop for us.  If lines start to get a bit long, they've opened more registers making wait time minimal.  They also have several self-checkouts near the customer service counter.  Have always found employees to be friendly, polite and helpful.  There are (2) Redbox kiosks in front, a water machine (25 cents a gallon).  As a VIP customer I save ALOT on our groceries.  For a family of 6 this is a huge bonus.  We also get discounted gas that is tied in to how much we buy (just saved 40 cents a gallon to gas up our SUV....it came out to $3.23 a gallon!...every penny counts!)  I recently got a mailing with about $30 in coupons, including free case of water, free bottle of salad dressing, free dozen eggs, etc)  Saved me even more.  We love this Fry's.......!        Getting water (25 ¢ a gallon @ machine)&  Gatorade, buy 10 get 5 free (plus $1.00 coupon off 5)

Absolutely terrible! First sign of trouble was weceaited in front almost 10 minutes and finally just seated ourselves.  Flagged down an employee and told them (4) for buffet and ordered drinks.  We normally look at buffets to see what they have, bit we had been running around fir hours and were hungry so "figured" it would be good...it was a Chinese buffet, we should be able to find decent food eh?  I mean, the China Buffet in Surprise is good spool...we took a risk, and lost, BIG TIME.   Food tasted lukewarm, sweet and sour chicken "rubbery"and sauce "watery."  Took forever for drink refills, desserts tasted stale.  Nothing good to say about it!  Went with husband and our (2) teenage sons, they all barely ate.  After about 20 minutes of picking at our food ended up going to Jack in the Box after wasting about $40 here...(2) enthusiastic thumbs down!

Great little store offering sweets and lots of nostalgia.  Fun shop to pop into.  I found candy (such as salt water taffy and googoo clusters) from my childhood, sweets from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, even regular "staples" such as Sweet tarts and MaryJanes.  They also sell novelty items such as tin signs, pez dispensers and metal lunchboxes.  There is also a nice variety of sugar-free confections.  Prices range from fair to somewhat pricey, but if you're aching to find a sweet that sparks a memory---this is the right spot!    Located near UltraStar Theatre, so great spot to pop in and grab something before a movie or to peek in and satisfy that sweet tooth!

We prefer Jersey Mike's and other delis for subs, but this Subway is nearby and very convenient so we frequent on occasion.  Compared to other Subway's we've been to, I'll say this one is one of the best.   The employees always greet when we walk in, regardless of how busy it is.  Even with a line, they have great customer service, act as a team to get customers taken care of quickly.  We've found the food to be put together nicely and haven't been disappointed (knock on wood).  Store is clean, behind the counters as well.  Employees look neat and friendly.  There is a comfortable amount of seating inside and out.  Our Subway has extended serving hours.  Subway is NOT our favorite franchise to get a sub, however, we enjoy when we do decide to pop in for a quick lunch or easy dinner for our kids....MUCH better alternative then a fast food joint like Sonic or McDonalds (in my opinion).

Been to the Saigon Kitchen 3 times now.  Once with a friend, another with my teenage daughter and other on a lunch date with my husband.  Will have to say have been absolutely pleased each time.  I ordered the Shaken beef (diced Filet Mignon) each time.  Husband ordered the Chicken Curry (which he liked) and we enjoyed egg rolls.    The food has been hot, tastes fresh, excellent presentation and absolutely delicious.  Portions, in my opinion, are definitely a good portion---just right.  Entree is served with white rice, soup/broth, and a tasty shredded side salad with a great Asian dressing.    Staff was polite and attentive, food came out in a timely manner.  Have thoroughly enjoyed my experience each time.   They play nice "Global Ambient" music, the restaurant is somewhat small yet cozy.  It has a nice "grown up" simple Asian feel.  Definitely a great place to meet a significant other or good friend to lunch.    NOT a place I would recommend for children; tables are somewhat close together and it has a relaxing feel.  Menu seemingly NOT designed with kids meals etc.  Also a bit expensive if considering price.  Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks, it came out to $39.    Worth the money, but if you are watching budget on a lunch date, just something to consider.  We definitely have listed this as a favorite place for us to dine sans kids!

Been to both the Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers in Goodyear and on Bell Road.  WE ARE HUGE FANS!    We are always greeted quickly and in a friendly way.  The staff is very helpful and attentive!    The food is amazing, great value for the money.  As one reviewer pointed out the burgers are thin...but we order a double and let me tell you "it'll make your tongue slap your eyeballs out!"  The burgers are VERY filling, so don't let that fool you.    The fries are shoestring style and super crispy, their Freddy's dipping sauce and the seasoning is outstanding...we even bought some there and use at home to season our own BBQ and fries/hashbrowns.    The Frozen custard is delicious and creamy.  Great portions and worth the money....our family of 6 (myself, husband, 3 teenagers and a 9 year old) ate for $38 which is just about what we pay when we (used to) go to McDonalds or Sonic (we don't "do" them anymore...burnout!)  Why go there when we can hit FREDDY's!  We go out of our way to visit them.  Never been disappointed (knock on wood) ;)  Only bummer...kinda far for us.....which now that I mention it could be a good thing, don't wanna turn into a SuperSize version of ME   (yep, it's THAT GOOD) ;)

Been looking for a regular spot to get mani/pedi for myself and my teenage daughter.  Royalty Nails is the closest to us, located right next to our local grocery store, so I was hoping this would be it.  It's NOT.  My daughter and I walked in on impulse and decided to give it a try.  The employees there were short, barely spoke to us and had to repeat what I wanted at least 4 times.    I took my own nailpolish (OPI) since I fell in love with the color and the lady doing my pedicure didn't want to use it.  She insisted I chose one from their wall, so I chose one that looked the closest, but not "exactly" what I wanted.    The nail technician was rough, my chair didn't work (was supposed to be a massaging chair) and I did not feel like I enjoyed the pedicure at all (relaxation and enjoying the pedicure ...in my opinion, is part of the experience of getting my pedicure!)  They gave me a hot stone foot massage, which I didn't as for.  I tried to stop the technician working on my feet and she kept nodding her head and did it anyway.  Price is comparable to others I suppose, paid $35 for spa pedicure with stone massage (had to pay for something I didn't want!)  I was not happy with the experience so far, so I told them to forget the manicure.  The man who rang me up had my card and another customer's card at the same time, I had to stop and correct him from charging the other customer's  card for my pedicure!  (Good thing I was paying attention!)  To be fair I tried them one more time, they did a decent job with waxing my eyebrows.  Same short reception when I walked in.  Employee was hard to explain anything to.  I lived overseas, so speaking with someone of another culture is not problematic, it just makes sense to have employees understand and express points to customers since they are the ones providing a service.   I was looking for MY SPOT for manicures, pedicures and waxing, this is NOT it.  Bottom line:  If this is how they treat ROYALTY, I would rather be commoner and go elsewhere!

My husband and I love to entertain and also enjoy a bottle of wine or a couple beers together.  Total Wine offers domestic and International liquor.  Everything from beer, wine, vodka, soju, sangria, etc.  Prices range from fair/modest to expensive (depending what you are buying).  They also have a walk-in Humidor area with a nice selection of cigars (yep, I smoke a nice cigar with my hubby on occasion!)  On certain days they have a counter set up where you can sample wine, one day we were lucky enough to sample some wonderful tequila.  The representatives were knowledgeable and helpful.  No high pressure sales; "if you like, you buy"  if not, it is ok too!  There is an amazing variety, fair prices (you can get 10% discount for buying a case of wine), the staff is friendly and super helpful!  It is a great one-stop shop!  It is clean, uber-organized and if you don't find what you are looking for---the very knowledgeable staff is quick and very informative.  Total Wine is our TOP SPOT for stocking up on all our alcohol!  A MUST for entertaining and party planning!  Super pleased!

Been to Beef O'Brady's twice.  My hubby and I were psyched about having a place nearby to have some appetizers, a few drinks, maybe watch a game and chill.    Unfortunately the service and food was below average.  Service was very slow in taking our order and delivering our food (both times).  We had to stop waitress to give us another drink refill (sodas AND beer)...had wings (average tasting), nachos (never had been someplace that "messed up" nachos)---apparently the chips are made there and were overdone around the edges.  My mozarella sticks were undercooked and the dipping sauce was runny.    We tried to give them a second shot after the first disappointment, but the second visit was just as much of a bummer....don't plan on making a third visit...had heard awesome things about this franchise, this one is a forgettable dining experience!

Been to Uptown Alley about half a dozen times so far.  Several times meeting up with a small group of friends, and a couple times on a date night with my husband.    WELL...cannot speak on the bowling alley part since we haven't been able to get into a lane due to the wait times.  But on the upside, we were able to get some good food and enjoy the company.    Highly recommend this as more of a "grown up" place to hang out if you want to eat too....there are LOTS of people there on any given night and food choices can get expensive (in addition to shelling out for video games) for kids (ours are 19, 15, 14 and 9).    Our favorite night to go is Thursday nights.  From 1500 (3 pm) until 11 they have HALF-PRICED appetizers and $2 domestic drafts.  My husband and I stopped in twice on thursday nights and had amazing service, not as busy as "usual" and we ordered (3) of their tasty appetizers and a couple beers a piece.  It came out to $26...WOW!  THe food was hot, fast and fresh.  Bartender (Claudia) was very friendly and attentive.    We watched pre-season game on their wall of tvs and had a really nice date night (within a tight budget this is awesome!)  NOTE: Thursday night is also Karaoke night which is cool if that's what you're there for, but you can hear the singing (howling in some cases) in the entire building so it kinda put a damper on trying to watch the game and catch whatever Olympics events we could see.....BUT we did hav a blast overall and it didn't dent the wallet! lol  Only negatives I see at this point are: limited and expensive food options for kids, forever waiting line for bowling (a bummer if that's what you came there for)---will have to update when I take the kids in for video games and paintball.....  Overall, a great place to hangout with friends or honey for a drink and a quick meal.....WE plan on being regulars (on thursdays)....especially after checking out a movie on date night!

A small but handy spot to get our lotto tix, pick up Redbox movie and get a car wash.  It is small, 6 pump stations, but convenient.   Attendants (in my experience here) have always been polite and professional.  Parking lot and store inside tidy.    The car wash is "brushless" so it saves wear on our paint job....great little convenience store/gas/car wash spot in Surprise!

Was looking forward to having a Mexican restaurant nearby.  Went with family to check Federico's out firsthand.  We'd heard it was an "awesome" franchise so we were jazzed to try some good Mexican food really close to our home!  We were pretty disappointed overall.    Pros:  It is nearby, decent parking available, simple, clean.  Portions are decent.  Employees were polite.  They had a couple strategically placed tvs and plenty of seating.  Their Horchata is delicious!  Cons:  On the expensive side for a quick place to eat (around $7.00 for a plate and a drink), with 6 of us this added up to the same it would cost to eat at a "fancier" place. Most of what we tried was very bland.  Small dollop of Sour cream and guacamole extra 69 cents for EACH serving. Adds up to about another $1.38 per person!   Husband liked his carne asada burrito.  The enchiladas, refried beans and rice were VERY bland.  The beef burritos had sliced green peppers and big chunks of tomatoes (not salsa consistency).  Never had a burrito with green peppers in it!  (and don't care to ever again!)  We left disappointed and like we'd blown  $60.00.  Even our teenagers were unhappy.  No one finished their plate.  We weren't happy, but will try again on Taco tuesdays for $1.00 tacos.  Hubby says he would get carne asada burrito by itself.    Will update review if/when we try again.  It is a shame, as its close by and we'd heard good things about the franchise!

OK....been back (2) more times to this Federico's (in Surprise).  The customer service has been outstanding.  The restaurant has been clean.  Food has been hot, and took others advice and stuck to the tacos.......Holy Frijole!  THEY ARE AWESOME!  Got the shredded beef tacos with an Horchata.......I am SO WOW'd by these (2) visits, that they made me take the time to update my initial review/impression from a 2-star to a 4-star.  The people working there, the service, the Tacos...well....YEP, HAPPY!
