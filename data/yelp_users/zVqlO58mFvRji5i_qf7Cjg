Went into this place yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. Great atmosphere, kind staff and great selection of colors and services. I had Becky as my nail tech and she was phenomenal. Glad I gave this place a chance.

Came to this nail saloon the other day for a full set of white tips. When I first got here the ladies were real kind and caring and a movie was playing. Throughout the process I noticed they didn't do things like the other places I have been to. About an hour later I was all done and felt satisfied with the job. While a couple hours later my nails were snagging on everything I touched. Then two days later my nails all cracked on the sides forcing me to cut and file the nails down. Needless to say this was the worst full set I have ever had done. I will never be back to this place.

This place needs to check how they rip people off. I have now given this store three tries and each time I regret it. Today I went in with a bag of clothes from brands like forever, Francesca's, American rag, Nordstrom bp and junky trunk. When the girl finished my sale she said we will buy 16 items for $35... I asked to see what she was buying and she told me one of my dresses ($52 with tag still on) was going to be sold for $14 and that I would get $4.25. I mean seriously... Then I said take the dress out which meant getting $2 per shirt. Not thinking about how much I was getting ripped off I signed my name and went on my way. Now looking back I wish I would have gone elsewhere. Considering that same dress I would have gotten $4.25 for here I made $15 for at a another place. Will never come back.
