WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! Seriously. Get it together, Half Moon. It's too bad because the food is decent. Waitresses have no idea what is going on. Asked for a manager and no one knew who it was. It's complete chaos.

I love going to this salon! I make my appointments during the week and I'm always the only customer there. It's quiet and relaxing. The place is really beautifully decorated as well. The staff are always friendly and meticulous. The shellac polish is amazing! I have already and will continue to recommend this place.

My fiance and I have gotten take out at least 3 or 4 times from this place so far. The food is great and the staff is so friendly. They always give me a few egg rolls free too, which is really nice. The vegetables and meat are always fresh. The fried rice is great. They are also fast! I usually call ahead and can get my food within 10-15 minutes. The combo deals are inexpensive and you get a lot of food.  As for some of the negative reviews, I don't know what you are talking about! Besides, if you have a problem dealing with someone's accent maybe you shouldn't order Chinese food. :) Just a thought.

Jenny is top notch! Jenny altered a gown for me to wear to a gala downtown back in August and she did such an amazing job that I brought my wedding dress to her in February. Altering my dress was a big task. I bought the dress last May and have lost some weight since so the dress needed a lot of work. Today was my final appointment and it felt like I was putting the dress on for the first time all over again. You know that feeling you get when you have THE dress on? It was beautifully altered and fit like a glove. Jenny pays close attention to detail and makes sure that she doesn't change the design of the dress or disturb the pattern. My dress was full lace and she made sure that whenever she needed to take it in she moved the lace back so it looked the same. She is very personable and remembers me whenever I go back to her. I will post some pictures of my dress after my wedding. I have already and will continue to recommend Jenny to everyone! She does quality work!
