Neat looking place, terrible customer service. I made an appointment a week ahead of time to have my car in for a simple repair - I was told it would take, at most, two hours. I bring it in on time and at first, the employee tells me to wait and stay in the car - me sitting in the car and my wife waiting with our infant. So were waiting and he never shows up to greet us. Eventually, I get out of the car and go to his kiosk, where he seems less than thrilled to see me. Begrudgingly, he takes my keys and tells me he will call as soon as its ready. So I'm at home on a Tuesday, not at work and in need of my car, waiting. After a few hours of being in limbo I call him to check on the status - he tells me they haven't even begun to work on the car yet and that they will try to get it in today... Two hours pass, three, four, five - and *boom* it's already 4pm. So they kept my car all day with no warning. This time he calls me and tells me they don't have the part for the car, even though the appointment was scheduled a week ahead of time... Ultimately, they want to keep my car over night.   Just keep in mind when you come here - if you have an appointment - it basically means nothing since they seem to take walk-ins. Also keep in mind that there is probably a healthy dose of incompetence involved as well.   Other Recommendations: Airpark Auto, anywhere else

As a fan of dive bars I have to give this place a big thumbs up. I may be a bit jaded though by have alot of friends play here. Cheap drinks, dark, low stage all pluses in my book. Also gotta love they serve white castle burgers. If youre into dive bars you definitely gotta hit this place.   Oh yea, and the pool tables are shit.

Great bar service and great drinks. That says it right there. Bartenders always seem to be right on.  Whenever I get to this place they always seem to have a card tournment going on that I just miss. Which is kinda weird. I was there the other night and it looks like they've redone their bathrooms which is a plus. They were getting pretty trashy there for awhile.   Seems like Pranksters gets alot of regulars, when I do stop in usually see alot of the same loyalists. The interior is not as dark as I prefer in my dives, but  you can always go outside to the patio. I can tell this is not a particularly popular place (which may actually not be a bad thing); but definatly a good place to drink with close friends (espically if your from CHICAGO or know anything about Chicago sports teams). They have food and it's good. So there you go.  I found all the upside down, crazy, crap on the walls to be lame and annoying. But hey, what do I know... Maybe flipped signs and pictures are funny as hell when youre trashed. I just don't see it though.  But yeah, did I mention the service was kick ass here? Had to tack on a 4th star for all the hustle and on-the-ball-ness.

This is a dive bar first and foremost. Cheap drinks, and a kicking jukebox. Nothing but good to say imo  Warning: Looking for a collegie Scoottsdale bar, best look elsewhere.

This place seems to always draw older business types, mainly business men or ASU guys. Yeah, it's important to note, not many women frequent this place. The waitresses are pretty and really nice. In the past I've never really had any problems with service. But, I've got upset at the cost of drinks.  Prices are way to high in my opinion, mainly for the quality of food (sports bar food). On top of that they actually want you to pay to get into this place (weekends). SRSLY? Just because everyother crappy bar on Mill. is charging a cover doesn't mean you have to follow the crowd off the cliff. Seems like Libary doesn't get it though.   /end rant

Everytime I come here the service is great. Great food, great drinks, good prices. One of the best bars in Tempe, if not THE best.   A few bad things... The inside bathroom is pretty terrible and waaaay too small (another outside). Sucks when your stuck waiting for some coke-head to get out of the bathroom so you can go. Parking can be a real problem, mainly on weekends. You may have to get creative where you park (side-streets, near dumpster, dirt).   Crowds here consist mainly of ASU college types, hipsters, and theatre geeks. I've noticed most of the older folks usually hang out at the inside bar. No jukebox, but sometimes they have random entertainment, like setting up video games outside. Giant patio for smoking, if that's your thing too. Be prepared for large crowds on weekend nights. Oh, and a hungry kitty prowling around  =)  This place is definitely worth checking out if you've never been.

Great food overall. Great location. Can get really, really crowded and loud, if that's your thing. I can see die-hard extroverts loving this place. 5 stars for always making my pick up orders easy and no nonsense, so I'm not held up too long.

Great pub with a geniune celtic feel. Like any good irishman I like space to roam around - this place has it with ample space and seating (upstairs and downstairs patio). The beers here are great, selection is great, as is the live irish music. One of these days I'd like to bring my fiddle and opt in for an irish jam session. Waiting staff was friendly and quick with food and drinks. Last time I was in about a week ago, there was a fight on the entrance patio one guy got a broken nose, the other a bloodly leg from a bottle cut. The cops were called and broke the whole thing up. Everyone else on the patio just hanging out, watching - entertainment, I guess. It was a good night though. I'll be back again.

Ah, I remember having my first Stella here oh so long ago...  I really enjoy Carly's atmosphere. Dark lighting, nice live music, and plenty of local art. The menu has a nice selection (mainly sammichs and paninis) and is vegetarian-friendly. I opted for the tuna melt, which was fantastic.   I have had some problems with bar service and service in general(minus 1). Basically the waitress took our order and then dissappeared for long periods of time. This sucked very much when it came time to get the check.... Maybe I'm being too kind but other than that it's a stand up place and in my opinion, one of Phx's most overlooked spots.

This is a great place to bring a date.  Plenty of chill area. I found it sorta odd that most of the light in this place comes from the small candles on the tables. Fun fact. I can't really think of anything else or bad to say about this place. Everytime I go there it's a good time. Cheers!

I'm a fan of Chasers. Great metal bands, good jukebox selection (less supersearching!), and interesting strangers. However, what I'm not a fan of is the covers. Worst of all $10+ to get in on amature night? Gangsta pleaze... Haven't graced the Chase in awhile but I do hope those have gone down some. Drink prices are OK, but I usually drink beer there so not too sure on the mixed stuff.

Great place to mellow out. Nice local art. I usually like to taper down and end my night here. Typically, the first place I think of when my family is in town and wants to head somewhere in the PHX area. Also awesome beer selection and a staff that doesn't get on your nerves.

So I was having a really stressful day. My cell broke and had to take it in to get repaired. Which, actually leads me to my review of Born (right next door to cell repair shop). As soon as I walked into this place I got a sense of calmness and peace. They have soft Asian music playing in the back ground, the lights are dim, they have walls of books, a lot of cultural stuff (China/Japan). Everything has a really amazing authentic feel.  You know, the kind of thing you don't get from a place like Starbucks or big commercial chains. Anyways, I ordered an iced green tea, which was the best I've had in a long time (most of what I've had has been the trash from ASU). The prices seemed to be a bit high, but with this kind of quality it's very worth it. They had some interesting stuff like green tea ice cream, which I sadly didn't have time to try =( Next to the two full bookshelves looked like there was a nice study area that I plan on taking advantage of in the future.   I definitely recommend this place to people who are sick of the whole crowded coffee house (Starbucks) gathering thing.
