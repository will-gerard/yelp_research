The margaritas here are good.  All of them.  We stopped in during our Cinco de Mayo, Tour de Margarita, and were not disappointed.  Unfortunately we did not eat during this visit, much to the detriment of our sobriety, but I'm sure there will be a next time.

I haven't been to the Hi-liter in years but have fond memories of this fine establishment.  A couple of years ago I was kicked in the head by a dancer who was giving a dance to Mike Tyson...  twice!  There was no blood so I let it slide...  I mean, did I really want to take a chance interrupting Mr. Tyson's good time and risk decapitation?  I think not.

Good food and a friendly staff typically make for a positive dining experience, El Bravo delivers on both fronts.    On my latest visit I opted for the green chile popover, it was very good.  The popover bread was perfect and the green chile was very tasty and pretty spicy.  I've had the bean and cheese popover and the sweet one as well, both are great.  I've ordered just about everything on the menu and have never left disappointed, although that may have something to do with the delicious cookie they give you with your ticket.

This place has really gone down hill over the years.  Every now and then I will give them a chance to redeem themselves and every time they have shit the bed.  Super Nachos and Carne Asada Fries, simple enough, right?  Wrong.  Both looked disgusting and had only a few crumbles of carne.  Their Green Chili Burrito?  I don't even know what to call the concoction they created, but it certainly was not a Green Chili burrito.  It seemed as though they simply slapped some beans in a tortilla, tossed in a few crumbles of carne from the previously mentioned fries and nachos, and topped it off with some of their mediocre salsa.  Wait... that's  exactly what they did.  If they get another chance from me it will be because someone else is buying, and when it sucks again I will not be surprised.

Chen & Wok is on the top of my list when it comes to quick chinese food.  Their house fried rice is very good and comes loaded with big chunks of meat and large shrimp.  Their lunch bowls are good and are a fair value.  I usually opt for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I have yet to be disappointed by anything I have ordered.

Bad food and bad service.  Been here twice since the reopening and likely wont be back.  +1 star for the TVs.

Dropped in the other day for an iced coffee, but opted for an Iced Vanilla Latte.  I was going to get a regular, but opted for a large.  It was really good and it was huge (That's what she said, right? Har Har Har)!  All jokes aside, I like this spot as an alternative to Starbucks.

This review is for the deli, mainly just for the baked chicken breast that I enjoy throughout my work week.  I've had the baked chicken breast from other Fry's delis and it is always dry, not here though, their's is always juicy and of healthy size.

I used to eat here at least once a week when I worked in the area, at LEAST once a week.  My go to items were as follows;  Red Chili burrito W/ beans (enchilada style), Machaca burrito, Machaca plate, Red Machaca burrito, Tamale and Enchilada plate, Two Taco plate, Chicken Tostadas, Green Chili combo....  Basically the whole menu.  Now that I think about it, my Carolinas fandom was probably the single greatest contributing factor to my ever expanding waistline.  It is not the best Mexican food evarr, but it is pretty damn good.

I have no idea how this place is still open...  The pork fried rice was horrible, I'm not even sure that it was pork.  Maybe it was pork, either way I wouldn't have known because there was more fat than meat.  If a chinese place can't do fried rice right, one is left to wonder what they can do right.

The first time I went to Los Reyes I ordered the Del Rey (before Man Vs Food)...  That was the last time I ordered it.  I was unaware of what I was getting myself into and was pretty embarrassed when it came to the table.  I definitely should not have ordered 2 of the ceviche tostadas to start!  That being said, the ceviche tostadas were great and for $.99 can't be beat.  The platillo de pechuga asada estan muy bueno, it's really, really good.  I have never been let down by anything I have ordered here.  From the quesadillas to the burritos to the mariscos, everything has been great.

La Promesa is a great bakery.  The empanadas here and at La Purisima are the best around, perfect flakey crust combined with delectable fillings.  Strawberry, lemon, apple, cherry, pineapple, all scrumptious and free of preservatives.  This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.

I stopped by this Paradise Bakery location today and ordered a half sandwich and salad, roasted turkey artichoke and chopped chicken cobb, to go.  When I got home I attacked my salad with the fury of 10,000 screaming Dothraki raiders...  it didn't last long, the salad was delicious.  That's when the horde, that was my hunger, turned its attention to the isolated and vulnerable half sandwich.  The attack was over as quickly as it began.  It came as great surprise that the half sandwich had erected impenetrable stone defenses otherwise known as bread.  Sad day you say?  I think not!  I called the location to voice my complaint, the bread on the sandwich was burnt and rock hard.  By this time the store had closed, but the very sweet manager not only offered me a whole sandwich to replace the concrete half sandwich, but a full refund as well.  I drove back got my sandwich, a refund and a bag of free cookies.  The food at every Paradise Bakery I've been to has been good, but the customer service tonight was incredible.  That to me is what sets any establishment apart from the rest.  The food at any random place could be great but if the service is lacking and unfriendly I will never return.  I will be back.

Ate last week at the Gallo Blanco and everything was great.  Drinks, food, atmosphere y todo.    To start we had an order of ceviche and two drinks, prickly pear and sueno mojado margaritas.  The drinks were good and the ceviche was spot on.  For our meal we decided to split the five tacos on the menu, as well as the oaxaca tamale.  The halibut taco was good, carne asada taco was good, shrimp taco was good, cochinita pibil taco was very good and the veggie taco was excellent.  The oaxaca tamale we ordered was was fantastic, the maza was perfect and the filling was amazing.  They make a great tamale, there is no question about it.  I was not expecting to enjoy my meal as much as I did and left quite satisfied.

Stopped in to have dinner for my brothers birthday.  Our party was a bit too large for the small dinning area, there was 8 in our group.  However, after a short wait they were able to accommodate us.    Everything I tasted was great, the only thing holding me back from giving a five star review is the small dining area.  I had two tacos and rice and beans.  The cochinita pibil taco was very good but the star of the show was the Aztec tinga.  So flavorful, so fat, so hot!  Man, good thing I had a horchata to cool the flames.  The horchata was very good but around halfway through it became nearly impossible to drink through the straw because of the fruit and nuts.  It was no big deal though.  All in all it was a great meal at a very reasonable price.

Best barber shop I have ever been to.  Massage and hot towel?  Are you kidding me?  They fade so clean and tight, the massage and hot towel are only the icing on the cake.  I was loyal to the same barber for over 5 years when I decided to give these guys a shot.  I never went back.

Solid spot!  Generous servings, and flavorful broths to satisfy your cravings.  I had the Tokyo ramen with pork and added an egg, corn and garlic puree.  The broth was light with just enough kick from the spice and the vegetables were very fresh.  We also had an order of gyoza and the shrimp purse.  Both were good but the ramen was clearly the star.  Next time I'm in the area I will have to make a point of stopping back in.

I've never watched a film at the Filmbar but I have indulged in many a fine beverage at the bar.  Liquor is not served here but that is made up for by the quality of beers that are available.  On Saturday nights the resident DJ, DJentrification, host "The Palace" and provides an international sound that really sets this bar apart from the rest.

I come here for the beer.  They have a great selection of beers on tap.  I am partial towards porters and stouts and what they carry satisfies my thirst.  I have only had pizza by the slice and the spinach artichoke dip on my visits, both were good but nothing special.  4 stars for the variety of beer and friendly service.

This is a great place to stop by before a game or event downtown.  Live music and great beers on tap make for a good time on their own.  Throw in a hip environment and solid food and your golden...err...copper.

Very, very good donuts.  If you're on a diet have just one... and when you start to feel guilty about it have another to remind yourself why it was all worth it.

I'll just make this quick.  The tapas here are fantastic, if money is your concern then come during happy hour.  The Spring Rolls, Panko Shrimp, Quail Eggs, Spicy Wantons and Pork Potstickers are all worth ordering. Again and again and again.  On my last trip I ordered the Soup Gyoza and the Pad Thai. I was so far beyond content I could hardly wipe the smile off my gluttonous face.

Sat at the bar last night, Kira Age Soy and Chicken Lollipops were the targeted tapas for the evening.  The Lollipops were very good, but the Kira Age Soy and the sauce that it came with were great.  I was also able to try the Fried Okra and that was very good as well.  Can't wait to go back.

Never having had Pho I stopped in not really knowing what to expect but expecting to order Pho.  Well, I didn't order Pho.  What I got was, Hu Tieu Nam Vang.  When I ordered the server asked me if I wanted it served American style or Vietnamese style, I bravely stated Vietnamese!  He proceeded to ask me at least three more times to make sure I was absolutely positive with my decision.  I was a little uneasy during the wait, because it seemed to me that he was trying to convince me to change my mind.  What had I gotten myself into?!?  A bowl of fantastic is what I got myself into, that's what!!!

I really like this casino...  and the casino really likes me...  because I lose, consistently.  On my last trip I dropped $20 into a slot machine called "Majestic Buck".  I was easily lured in by the image of what was indeed a majestic buck.  2 minutes later and $20 poorer I sat myself down at one of the many Blackjack tables.  My luck didn't change so I retired to the lounge.  On this particular evening the lounge had the outside doors open and the fire pits going while the band of the night played away.  Maybe next time I will skip the gambling and just hang out in the lounge.  /Lies

My rating is based on experiences from previous visits to the sister establishment on 16th St.  The service and quality do not hold up here.  I hate to be so blunt but that is the way it has to be.  I have watched people walk out due to lack of service.  Watched a father and son dine without silverware!  THEY DID IT.  Will they be back???  Watched my uncle clean a dirty table that had been sitting dirty long before we had decided to sit outside and just before we had decided to leave.  All in the same day.  The food has been really good here, but they definitely have some growing to do.  We have come to love La Santisima's and would have no problem going back to the 16th St. location.  Get it together.

This place is a cesspool, hands down the worst Circle K I have ever been to.  I used to work as a driver and have seen my fair share of Circle K stores throughout the Valley and it is not even close.  This store could be demolished tomorrow but the stains would remain for an eternity.  If you should have the misfortune of running out of gas in front of this store, do yourself a favor and push your car to the Circle K on 83rd or the QT on 99th Ave.  Just stay away.
