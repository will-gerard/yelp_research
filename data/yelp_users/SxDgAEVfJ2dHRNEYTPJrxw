My Kind of Place!!  Nothing snobby or fancy, just great homemade italian food!  We didn't know that the restaurant closed at 9 PM, so at about 9:20 PM we walked in on saturday night to a packed restaurant.  I asked the owner if they were closed, he told us to hold on while he checked with the kitchen... a minute later he had us seated... we were very grateful!  I moved to AZ about 5 years ago from NJ, where in my opinion some of the best italian food is...I have not found a good italian restaurant in AZ until now... I ordered an osso bucco that sat on top of homemade pasta.  OMG, so good, It was a very generous portion and the meat separated from the bone with a fork.. delicious and $19.. How can you beat that?  Osso bucco, whether beef, pork or lamb anywhere else will cost you at least $30... We also ordered a calamari appetizer that was swimming in a tasty gravy which we dipped garlic bread in... the gravy was extra tasty as well.. My partner ordered a bolognese sauce over home made noodles... the bolognese had 6-7 cured meat in it, which made for a nice meaty flavor... could have used more garlic but was nonetheless delicious.  We were too full to try any desserts but the tiramisu looked great and I will definitely be back to try that.  The owner made it a point to come over and have a conversation with us.  He is from NY and takes pride in the food they make.  Some other reviews have commented that the food network sign they have in front is a little much... perhaps, but they are a small business and I don't think there is anything wrong in taking advantage of the fact that they are good enough to be featured on that network.  I would have never found this gem if it weren't for seeing it on the show... Thanks again, and I can't wait to be back!!

I came here because of the chopped salad pictures I saw in other reviews.  We went on a saturday for lunch.  I ordered the cowboy ciao signature chopped salad and my partner ordered a burger.  The salad came out and looked beautiful only a lot smaller than I thought.  Ingredients were nice and the best part was that you could actually eat it with a spoon!!  That is the way a choppped salad should be..Warning, if you are really hungry, this chopped salad is probably not going to be enough to satisfy..  Service was good, however, I thought this restaurant was too pricey.  My partner ordered a burger and asked for bacon and cheese on it...this ended up costing a total of $17 for a burger... Overall: Food: 4, Service: 4, Value: 2.. should be 3.5 stars ..

I live in Buckeye, but we make the drive to wash our dogs here.  Without naming other businesses in the same industry, I can tell you that wag n wash is not only slightly better, it is head and shoulders above the other self-wash pet places I have been to.   Price: $13 - basic (which is great for me since i bring my own shampoo), $15; and $17 (premium treatment), very affordable  Customer Service:  This place rocks!!  The employees are very good with animals; they take you to the washing station and explain to you how everything works and give you a bucket of all the things you will need (towels, shampoo, conditioner, 3 different brushes to brush out hair to start, another one while they are lathered up, and one to use while drying), the staff checked on us 4 times while we were washing!!!!  Unbelievable! the place we used to go near our house would not check up on us even once and they charged $15... if we need extra towels, or assistance with anything, anyone of the wag n wash staff are right on it!  This is how you run a business!  When I had to transfer dog to drying station, one of the employees told me to hold on and to set a towel on the ground so my pet wouldn't slip!  Are you kiddin me?  That would not happen where we used to go(again not naming names)  The dryers here also blow warm air!  We have been used to high power dryers that blow cold air, so the dogs are uncomfortable and they don't get dry.   Thanks Wag n' wash!  keep your prices aggressive and competitive and customer service where it is, and we will be customers for life (or as long as we live within a 40 mile radius :))  LOVE this place!!

I hate writing a bad review... The last two times I have gone through their drive through I ask for an Americano with 2 inches of steamed half-and-half... Both times I get my beverage and I'm halfway home and realize they have not put a drop of half-and-half in.  So I drive back to walk inside to tell them. And they do offer an apology.. Not one time did they offer to comp my drink even though they've wasted about 15 minutes of my time getting home and then getting back just to get my half-and-half.  Not only that but the second time I tell them, they continue to make about seven drinks before they get to mine... The people seem nice but as far as customer service goes I give them 2 stars

Ditto to Elmer from San Diego's visit on 3/21... :)  I am very picky when it comes to thai food.. these guys are the real deal and as Elmer stated, "in the valley of the sun where mediocre and chain restaurants hail supreme..." he's right, I moved here from NJ where most restaurants are owned individually.. but he's right on with this place.. good, tasty food with this kind of flavor takes time..  This is problably one of the only restaurants who can make the food authentically thai spicy... I drive 25 miles from my house at least twice a month to get this food and I always order too much so I'll have leftovers.  All the curries are thick (not watered down) and so tasty!  I would definitely recommend getting the Tom Kha soup (cocunt soup) and eat it with some steamed rice... it's the bomb!    I don't know how this place averages only 4 stars... there are obviously people who don' t know what good thai food is about!    Oh and not that this part matters as much to me, but it is very beautiful, clean, and the service is good too.. (added bonus) :)  Happy eating!

The only thing I can rate is the frozen custard.. I don't know anything about the other food they serve here.  It started with one scoop of vanilla custard in a dish everyday for a week.  Then, I started to crave it more and got 2 scoops... this stuff is so tasty.  I like vanilla better than chocolate and I am not interested in the flavor of the day.  I have been trying to "break the habit" of eating this stuff so finally one day I asked for a nutrition guide... turns out 1 scoop of this bliss has 308 calories (more than haagen daas).. so 2 scoops is equivalent to a one hour run... just to put it in perspective.. If you don't care about calories, this  stuff is sweet bliss in a dish!!!

We went here for dinner last night.  The price was $26/person.. not bad considering there are raw oysters, big shrimp cocktail, sea bass, salmon, duck drumettes, Prime rib, ribs.  It is not the largest spread I've been to like at the Rio in Las Vegas, however, it is not as pricey either.. Surprisingly the stone oven baked pizza was awesome.. they had one with wagyu beef on it that was really good.  Service was extremely attentive, the staff very polite, and the food was consistently being replaced.  In fact, I was reaching for some grilled asparagus when the server behind the counter told me to leave that and he would have some fresh grilled asparagus for me to take instead... This is one of the cleanest buffet's I have ever been to as well.  If all you are looking for is a huge buffet and you don't care about the quality of food this may not be your place, however, I found the selection to be more than sufficient... oh did I mention they have gelato.. really yummy gelato..?  Good buffet, I would recommend.

A beautiful and quaint addition to Suddenly Slimmer!  I just wrote a review on Suddenly slimmer so felt that I needed to rate Rio as well!  I love coming here as well just for the quiet, but fun feel of it.  It has a different vibe than SS.  It's a great place to come in if you don't have a lot of time and want to be in and out for your wax... Dannielli does my brow waxes here and she is a genius with brows!!   You can get them cheaper elsewhere, but they will not be as good ( I learned the hard way)!!  You will feel very comfortable here.

I usually go to Starbucks for coffee before i travel but all they had was cartel and paradise bakery in my terminal.  I chose cartel because I am not a fan of any coffee/espresso from paradise... I ordered a small vanilla latte which I thought would be 12 oz... The cup was 8 oz so I was a little disappointed.   Took my first sip and it was pure delicious!  Well worth the 4.25 spent!  They take a longer time to make the coffee but it is soooo worth it because it is soooooo smooth... It is located in terminal 4 gate C11-19... worth the walk if you are in terminal D...

I ordered the sea scallops in a sweet potato and bacon hash.. It was excellent! 5 large scallops seared beautifully.
