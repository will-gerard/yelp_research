We use to go to the Desert Ridge location in Phoenix, AZ every week.  Last month we went there and my son wanted the baked chicken on the kids menu.  The menu says choose two, so I asked him what else he wanted.  He said chicken.  When I asked for double chicken the person serving said no that they had to be two different items.  I said that was dumb, it doesn't say select two different items, the sign says choose two.  I was then told it was "corporate policy."  Really?  Corporate policy to be down right rude to your customers about it?  Well tonight my son wanted to go back.  Dreading the trip, I fought the same battle.  To prove how shady this location is, after having the same battle, I asked for the corporate office phone number.  They REFUSED to give it to me.  Again really?  Do they not understand the Internet and power of social media?  Rather than handling the situation in a customer friendly way, they gave me a tough sh*t attitude, refused to give me the corporate number, and were very rude over all.  Let's see if they understand the power of social media and review sites now.  Unreal a company this day in age could be so rude to people...numerous times!
