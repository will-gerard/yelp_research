I had never heard of this place when i went here for a lunch meeting.  We arrived about noon on a Wednesday and the place was busy, but not packed.  The weather outside was awesome and we wanted to sit outside but the noise from the fountains/waterfalls up against the patio was really loud to talk over so we sat inside.    The chips and salsa they brought out was amazing.  The bowl had 4 different types and flavors of chips and the salsa had a good taste and spice without being too hot.  For a meal i picked the Meatloaf and it was a ton of food.  2 huge pieces meatloaf that was seared on a grill after it was cooked came out with corn & mashed potatoes and a roasted tomato BBQ sauce.  I ate the whole thing (even though it was more food that i should have eaten) and i didn't feel bad!.  The meeting was a little hard to pay attention to though since the windows faced the pathway and the women from ASU downtown and all of the businesses kept walking by!!!

driving down northern we saw this place and decided to give it a shot. the place is VERY small inside but luckily the weather was nice so we were able to eat at a table outside.   The sauce was really good and so was the cheese,  the pepperoni was really good also.  the pizza was cooked just perfect, not soggy, not too crunchy, i wish it was closer.

Been going to this place since i can remember.  they use to sponsor my little league baseball team!  stopped in last week with some work friends from out of town who wanted something different than Mexican Food!  Got the Cheesesteak with onions and peppers, fries and fried zucchini.  like always the food was amazing, the waitress was friendly and we got everything we wanted and refills.  the one thing i have to remember is i need to order a HALF since the whole is WAY too much food for me now :)

Stopped by while on the other end of the world running errands.  I saw a sign and had heard about it so we went in and got some food.  Got a Gyro and a Chicken Picado Pita.  Both were amazing, and the extra tzatziki was really nice to dip the fries in.  The staff was really friendly and seemed to be checking on the customers to make sure everything was ok.  I'm wishing this place was closer so i could try more menu items, but i guess it will have to wait till i'm out that way!

.So happy they opened back up after a fire.  The food here is amazing.  I have tried most of the things on the menu over the years and have NEVER been disappointed.  the other night i got a "daisy dog" which was a corn dog but with the different type of batter!    To sum it up if you want some good food, cheap, with the risk of getting killed in a drive by shooting then this is your place!  i know i will go back soon!!!

this is a place by my work that I eat at from time to time (over the past 12 years), mainly cause it's convenient!  the food is decent, but not great.  the menu is really odd, instead of a build your own sandwich menu they have 60+ (yes, 60) pre-made ones, and the difference between some is only something simple like mayo...   if you want a sub and are in the area, it's worth a stop, but i wouldn't go out of your way for it

Went with some work friends cause it sounded good.  they have some great meat selections to pick, and being all you can eat i tried it all, and then kept eating.  the guys coming out with the meat on the sticks were really friendly.  the salad bar was the start of the meal, and really sucked, was a waste of time :)  for drinks we ordered some drinks and got one they said was strong 151.  the drink sucked and barely had the taste of rum in it so we mentioned it to the bartender (hoping maybe they would throw a little extra in the cup) and got a total attitude about it and the refusal to do anything.  The "House" drink the waiter recommended was really good though.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and atmosphere but not sure i will go back (the whole  weak drink think really bothered me)

in the area with family and found this place on yelp.  Trying to find it in person was a LOT more difficult though being tucked back in the corner behind trees.  At first glance the menu was VERY overwhelming, but the owner (?) and the guy taking out order explained it all since we were 1st timers and it made it much easier.  We got the "Italian stallion" and the "suicide 6".  Both sandwiches were amazing, not sure which i liked better (i think the suicide 6), and they did NOT skimp on the meat/cheese that is for sure.  My 4 year old loved the chicken soup and picked at the pasta salad for a bit.  It did take some time to get our food but since it's all fresh and the weather outside on the patio was awesome i didn't mind.  overall i was very impressed and next time i'm in the area i will go back!!

wow, the best burger i've ever had from a take out style place!  was in the mood for a burger and finally decided to give this place a try.  Stopped in about 7:30 and ordered 2 cheese burgers and some chilli cheese fries.  while waiting for my food the owner came out to say hi and we talked for a bit about BBQ and Smoking Meats.  he gave me a taste of the beef brisket and i will be ordering that next time i go in, the meat was amazing and the sauce was VERY flavorful.  The burgers were also amazing.  the quality of meat this place uses is awesome, not what is expected for a takeout style place and for the price (very inexpensive).  The mayo sauce is made in house and also very tasty too, these guys know how to BBQ!  I can't wait to go back and try some different menu items, i'm glad i decided to finally stop in!

Good burgers, zucchini and root beer floats.  I hit up the drive thru and grabbed some food and for the place looking like a bit of a dump i was pretty impressed with the food.  I will definitely go back and try some other stuff!

Went with a group (6 adults) of friends and my 3 year old.  While I don't eat fish I hoped they had something I would enjoy.  Their menu was awesome.  They had beef, chicken, pork, vegan and vegetarian meals so there was something for everyone.  My daughter got the sesame chicken kids meal and i got the steak teriyaki (everyone else pretty much got raw fish!!!).  the food came out and everyone was happy, my steak was amazing and cooked rare, just like I ordered.  My 3 year old's chicken was amazing, and the portion (for $6) was enough for an adult!  We did a check-in and all got free soup too, so check foursquare to see what they have.  Overall it was a good time, the waitress was on top of our table with food, drinks, and refills even though she had orders to take care of.  I can't speak for the shahimi or sushi, but everyone seemed to be happy with the variety and quality of what they were bringing out.

WOW! i LOVE burgers and picked up a Groupon for this place about 5 months ago and finally got around to using it tonight (since it expires next week).  The Hostess and Waiter was really nice and friendly, explaining all of the specials, the happy hour, and the YAPPY hour where you can bring your dog with you to eat on the patio. They also had a very large bar and selection of alchohol but i didn't get anything.  I skipped the prebuilt burgers and built my own 2/3 lbs (after cooking).  The add-on choices were great, and the spicy sour cream was amazing!  The Sweet Potato fries were also amazing and came with dipping sauce that tasted like melted marshmallows.  We also got a side of the cheesy cheddar fries and loved them.  Overall, this place is great, high quality foods and toppings and a great staff.  the prices seemed a little high when ordering but after we ate i didn't feel that way and plan on going back again soon!

I really like this place.  The food has always been good, i've tried about 8 different things and never disappointed.  The quantity of food is VERY generous and i am always stuffed.  The prices are decent, not cheap, but not more than a large combo at McDonalds and it's way better.  I've never been inside since they have a drive through and i'd rather eat at home watching TV.  the drive thru is slow, but i'm sure going in isn't any faster.  The staff has always been helpful, answering my stupid questions of "what is a blah?"!

this place is great for Breakfast and Lunch.  we stop by about once a month, usually for breakfast (the nana's breakfast w/green chili)  The inside is small, and not many seats inside, but we always make it work.  The area is very "questionable" though, and i think it's the reason it's not open after dark.    major downside to this place is the parking.  the small lot is SMALL, tight spots, and anytime i pull out we almost get hit cause of the blind exit so be careful

drove by this place and wanted a burger so i stopped in with friends.    Order a bacon cheese burger which was really good, the house sauce is very tasty too so i'm glad i choose that.  I also ordered the Cheese Fries which was a pretty large portion with melted cheese wiz type cheese on it and very enjoyable.  The rest of the food also looked amazing and i was wishing i ordered the Italian beef after seeing another table with it, so next time i am getting that.  Also being close to ASU was nice since there were a few hot chick working behind the counter.

i always hear about this place and the Hype that goes along with it so i stopped in to get a good burger.  for a place that was pretty empty it took a while to get our food.  The sweet potato fries were very good, i will say that, but the burger was pretty thin and i think they hoped all of the toppings on the list would hide that, but it didn't.  the burger was "ok", nothing special but i won't be going back

Saw the cow outside and stopped in. Once looking at menu remember a friend talking about the hanging meat thing.  we went inside and had just missed the dinner rush so the place was pretty quiet (which was nice since we brought our 3 year old).    The food was awesome, the staff was so friendly and gave us lots of attention.  The Decore was nice, the place would big, i can see it getting packed on weekends and special occasions.    i can't wait to go back and try a few other things!

Went with friends to grab a few drinks and the place was dead, and for being 9pm i was a bit shocked.  The waitress never came around and most of us sad with an empty glass so we decided to just move on to another place!

Stopped in after dinner at Caesars to get a few more drinks with some friends cause when we walked by it looked good.  we walked in and found almost all of the tables said "reserved" even though the place wasn't packed.  we sat at a reserved table that the sign magically fell off of, within a minute the waitress was making us move cause those tables had a bottle service minimum.  we moved to an open area by the window which turned out better cause we could watch everyone walking up and down the strip.  The alcohol was reasonably priced with a good selection.  I tried the signature drinks "mango something", "Cosmo", "Pineapple express"!  only think i would have changed was the music was a bit loud and made it hard to actually talk, but we made it work and had a good enough time we didn't want to find another place!

decided to give this place a shot since it looked like it was busy and full of life.  We went to the second floor and found a couch and chairs to hang out in.  Our waitress was good, kept our drinks full, and was helpful with suggestions (and she wasn't too bad to look at either).   One thing i didnt know is that they have a bathroom on the floor so twice i went down the stairs and through the casino just to pee!

This is the type of place that when you drive by you would NEVER stop in, its a small small market that caters to WIC and food stamp people in the surrounding ghetto.  I work down the street and one day when driving by i saw a sign pop up that said "Pizza & Wings" and since i LOVE pizza we took the chance with our life and stopped in.   The guys who work there are awesome and friendly.  The pizza is awesome, they make their own down and sauce, and all of the meats are BEEF based since they have a lot of Muslim customers.  I've been back tons of times and they have catered a few work lunches for us too!

been here twice now, and the burgers are awesome.  i love the ability to build my own burgers on the phone APP at a stop light and then pick it up 15 minutes later.  the first time i went for some reason the order never got made but i only had to wait a few extra minutes and they got it for me (and the workers were VERY apologetic)   It;s close, good price, and good food, and i will keep going back

stopped in cause i love Shave Ice but it's hard to find good stuff here.  the place is a decent size and very clean inside.  I ordered the Original with mangos and Milk Glaze.  i bought the Small cause it seemed really big (and it was really big) but it was so amazing that i wished i got the large.  the guy working the counter was friends and helpful and i can't wait to go back and try some other flavors!  People just need to be aware, this is NOT a snow cone place, if you are looking to get one of those you need to keep looking!

Stopped by the weekend they opened and the place was packed.  The employees were friendly and fun, and obviously enjoy what they are doing.  I've been back many times since and have ALWAYS loved my drinks and the service.  The italian Soda's are amazing, and the Mocha Freeze was awesome too!  My only complaint is that they used "canned" whipped cream, i wish they made it themselfs!

met some friends here for lunch last week and had never heard of the place.  Upon walking in i was PLEASANTLY surprised!  The name "twin peaks" finally made sense and i was greeted by 7 girls wearing VERY not much, and that was nice!  the place was full of big screen TVs with all different sports on so that was nice.  the burgers were decent and the price wasn't too bad, but the waitresses were defiantly the best part!
