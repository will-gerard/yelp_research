The food is better than typical bar fare - my husband and I both enjoyed the food - but I cannot recommend this place because we had such a bad experience here.   This was our first visit to Duke's on McDowell Road, which is pretty close to our home. Great location for a sports bar and a cool place to watch sports on a hot summer day in Scottsdale.   We went to Duke's to watch Game 7 of the NHL Western Conference playoffs, and the owner refused to put it on in the main part of the bar, despite multiple customers' requests.  He told hockey fans to go to the pool (billiards) room to watch the game. No one went.  As we were leaving, my husband told the owner that we would have stayed longer if we could have heard the game. "What do you want to hear, the puck going into the net?" he says, laughing at us. And he tells us, "See ya later," telling us if we don't like it we can leave. Who does that??  We weren't asking him to turn off the Dodgers game. We wanted him to turn off the sound for baseball and turn ON the sound for hockey.    We'll never go back to Duke's. Scottsdale has many other, better choices.

Went here on a Sunday for brunch, about 10 a.m., and was seated right away. I've eaten here many times for brunch, lunch and dinner and for some reason they just can't seem to get it together for brunch. Always slow service, even with lots of empty tables. The couple seated at the table next to us gave up and left and just as my husband started our countdown to departure ("10, 9, 8...") our server showed up. We had to ask numerous times for coffee refills (which the server said they were brewing - how does a restaurant keep running out of coffee??). It's such a bummer that Herb Box doesn't offer better service. The food is good (not great), it's close to home and the setting makes me feel like I'm on vacation while I'm there.

This place is so convenient to our home, and we wish it were better. The food is very good, but the service is consistently late and the staff is consistently unapologetic and borderline rude. We've given the place several tries, hoping they were just working out the opening-week kinks. There are too many good pizza and Italian places nearby to waste another trip to Vito's.

Maybe it was growing pains, but the place has significantly improved. We've moved out of the neighborhood but continue to go back to Vito's. It's one of my son's favorite places for pizza, and my husband and I love the pesto sauce. They'll make things off the menu, if they have the ingredients. The staff (some of them) remember us, which makes us feel good and enjoy this neighborhood restaurant.

Rehab Burger is known for its creativity when it comes to burgers. They've got some crazy concoctions. I'm a traditionalist when it comes to burgers - just give me ketchup, pickle, tomato and lettuce. Their buns and burgers are top quality, the fries are amazing, and the service is very good.

This place is quickly becoming my favorite neighborhood place. The first time I ate here, my son & I went for brunch. When our waiter learned it was our first visit, he told the manager, who brought us a delicious complimentary dessert. Smart move: I've been back several times, and each time gets better.   My favorites: chicken risotto, roasted artichoke hearts (incredibly smoky flavor), cheese boards (with frozen grapes!), any of the eggs benedict for brunch and, of course, their wine list.  My only complaint is the noise level. I'm pushing 50, so the hearing is just starting to go. If it's nice out, opt for outside where the cacophony  of the bar area doesn't drown out your conversations.    Ok, I have another complaint - the parking sucks and their valet is hit and miss. My husband and I ate here on New Years Eve, and I was wearing heels - didn't want to hike across Safeway's parking lot - and they had no valet service.   However ... the food, wine list and service are worth the walk ...

The BEST sushi in The Valley. We eat here at least once a week. The fishes are the freshest and portions are generous. We never order from the menu and look forward to the custom creations that J surprises us with. He knows we prefer rolls without rice and he has never disappointed. We love this place. He's a sushi artist!

Great service. Best burgers--juicy, fresh and coked exactly to order. Delicious with and with the bun. Great beer selection and we look forward to their on-site brews once that's up and running. Everything we've had to eat here has been delicious.
