This has become one of my favorite spots downtown! I keep going back and probably always will as long as they never change! I've been for late night dinner, Sunday brunch, happy hour. The service has been consistently good and the food is amazing! This is no ordinary bar menu. You can have an actual dinner. Prime rib, chicken, salmon, burgers, wraps. My favorite is the Bourbon Steak Wrap! It's just that it's too big for me to finish! Every day of the week they have specials and they are always hosting parties, events, etc. Guaranteed there is something for everyone. The staff is great! Ray and Jeff the bartenders are professional and still fun! There is a nice patio and I've heard there is also a big upstairs room but I've never been up. Next time. Lots of TVs and plenty of room for large groups. Clean bathrooms, live music some nights and even a DJ on Friday nights I think. Brunch menu is unbelievably good! I had mimosas of course to quench my thirst. : ) Hits the spot-especially after a night of drinking! AND the deserts they have are even delicious! There is a lot more I can say and I am pretty picky about the places I like. Definitely go!

Probably the worst Italian food I've ever had!! And those who know me, know I have been to PLENTY of Italian restaurants. So to say this place had the worst food, trust me it was that bad. My friend commented on the lasagna that it didn't even taste as good as Stouffers frozen. The Chicken Marsala I ordered was so tough, I couldn't even cut it! I definitely could have done 100 times better. The atmosphere is great, but the service doesn't support such a cool looking restaurant. I'm not sure how long it took to get a glass of wine and beer from the waiter but it semed like forever! There is no parking in the front so you have to drive around to the back which is a tad unsavory honestly. How do you mess up Italian food THAT bad?? Really! Go somewhere else. Do not take anyone but your kids here and order something like spaghetti and meatballs!! Then cross your fingers!

I love our arenas! Seriously, we have amazing sports arenas and this one was too! I had nice seats which always helps. I am not a big fan of all the stuff they do at games with dancers and contests and mascots, but whatever, you have to put up with that crap. I don't even like basketball that much but the stadium was really nice and clean and lots of selection on food and drinks-which is important to ME! Lol. I was upgraded to one of the suites and the suite was very nice too. Highly recommend meeting someone that has suite tickets and then get them to invite you up! Bathrooms clean, staff very helpful. I look forward to going again.

This place is so NOT Celebrity! LOL I think I have heard the other locations might be good, but this is a below average store with nice better than average beds. Their prices are not very good. The packages almost definitely include a "set up/admin." fee But I have to say, they have a good variety of different levels of beds. The big turn off to me is there are no mirrors in the rooms and very little amenities like extra towels, clothes hooks, or extra space for dressing/undressing. The staff will always try and upsell you or get you to buy something but honestly, they aren't that friendly. The standup is the worst I have ever used, which is just that particular manufacturer I'm sure, but it's got gaps/voids on all sides so it's not even distribution of rays at all and it's just a very strange "bed" with nothing in the room whatsoever. Weird. Didn't like it. Very vanilla shop. Nothing special. Good beds if you are willing to pay a high price for them.

Sometimes it's more than just the food at the restaurant! You can't really ignore the setting, decor and ambiance of this place. It's literally nestled in Old Town near the galleries and sunken below the street level. It's surrounded by wine art-like bottles coming out of concrete walls and fountains, wrought iron, and shrubs and greenery. I mean, you could get engaged here it's so beautiful and romantic! ME, however; I'm there for the food! And it's tadiefawr!! We had the special appetizer which was a Buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto and olive oil drizzle. Salads were fresh and crisp. I went with the veal scalopine and it was incredible. They offered options and variations of some dishes which gave you the ability to mix and create a  little. I would love to try sometime for lunch. There was music on the patio outside but we were in the restaurant area. Now that it has cooled down, I would go back and sit outside. I bet it's amazing! The waiters and wait staff are sophisticated and educated on their dishes so talk them up and get their feedback. This is probably now one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale for sure for the whole experience. Unforgettable!

The whole idea of a no kill shelter is admirable, especially in Phoenix where we have such a problem with homeless pets and overpopulation. The staff were great, friendly, patient and knowledgeable. And each one explained every step of the process all the  way to what they were all about and why they are a no kill shelter. I learned as much about the members of the staff as I did each dog. They never rushed us or got impatient with our indecisiveness. It's so hard to pick one dog to take home with you! You can tell they genuinely love their jobs and what they are doing and they have organized systems and policies which is great. The only minor complaint we had was that we arrived around the same time as another family and were all there to see (adopt) the same dog! We finally had to go back to the sign in sheet and see who actually signed in first but they handled the misunderstanding with diplomacy and tact and at the end, everyone took home a new pet! And that's the most important thing. I love my new puppy and I think I was meant to get her instead of the dog that went to the other family. Funny how things work out that way sometimes. They had reasonable adoption fees, leashes and tennis balls to take home, a bag of food and my puppy was spayed and microchipped. Overall a very good experience! I just wish I could save all the dogs there!! : (

Got my windows tinted here right before summer. Whew! My bartender recommended the place! I was informed of all of my different options, prices, effectiveness and even what might look best on my car while still preserving the integrity of it's appearance! The service was great and it was ready even ahead of schedule.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Their lifetime guarantee is great. I would definitely recommend this place for tinting and alarm systems!

Friday night, ordered for pick up. Food is always amazing. But the serivce seems to be getting BETTER. The bartender offered me a drink while I waited for my order to be picked up. They gave me EXTRA ranch, where most places charge you, and just overall friendly and professional. Garlic knots are my favorite. I ate them the next day for lunch AND dinner! Mmmmph! Pizza is terrific and the menu includes a lot of other dishes I am eager to try!

I've been to this office several times and not every trip or treatment was amazing, but overall, the staff was pretty nice and friendly. Marilyn is amazing! You want to just take her home with you she's so nice! Cleaning your teeth has never felt better than when she just tells her simple stories in her soothing voice as she works! LOL The front desk girls are young and a little inexperienced, but they seem to know their job and have friendly tones for the most part. Going to the dentist is usually not fun, but the office is clean, plenty of magazines to read, a TV, some toys for the kids and they are very good at following up to schedule future apointments and also at confirming them. Which is important. I've never really experienced anything bad at this location, so not sure where the negative reviews are coming from. I brought my son in also and they cleaned his little teeth too!

The only coffee place that has it all. Good service, good drinks, very informative menus/display boards, free WI-FI + free laptops, patio seating on the Lake at Anderson Springs. If there was a downside at all, it would be the parking. But even when it's busy, the staff is extremely efficient while still being incredibly patient and friendly. Starbucks? PUH LEEZ! Touche.

Ahhh, my favorite place for tailoring! Us short people rely on places like Artful Tailoring. It's been a while since I have been in, but I have given them everything from my Lucky Brand sweats, to Ann Taylor slacks to an old pair of jeans for mending! I've never had a bad experience here and their prices are fair. Service is fantastic and you can count on your clothes being ready when promised! The store is clean and has an upscale feel. Aladdin is knowledgeable and friendly. They are great at difficult jobs or specialty items too! Won't ever go anywhere else.

Like Sandy, I love this place! Hard to believe such an amazing place is hidden off the I-10 but once you find it, you will be in awe! Follow the signs past the casino to Aji Spa. I have been many times for the "day pass" where I think you pay $40.00? to just use the steam room, the whirlpool, lay out in the sun and swim in the pool. They have a women's pool and a coed pool. They told me clothes were optional but why am I ALWAYS the only naked woman?? Anyway, their facility is clean, private, relaxing and professional. They have great product in the showers-shampoo and conditioner are actually really good. They sell many spa products in the gift shop. I like going for the seasonal treatments like around winter time they start offering cranberry body scrubs and some pumpkin pumice foot massage with your pedi. Oh my gosh! That's what I call Autumn! I can say I have never really seen it get too occupied which is good but it also lends to the feeling of uncomfortable-ness (is that a word) in the locker room. I noticed most women in there are a little older and maybe not regular spa goers. Hence the "why am I the only naked person"? Oh well, aside from that, love it and love the helpers and staff!

It's not the only 5 star restaurant in AZ. for nothing! I would advise to defintely bring and open mind, your best manners and an entire paycheck. (Our bill was over $600) I had the steak because I was afraid to try buffalo. Everything that touched your mouth was amazing though. We had a lobster appetizer, I also had goats meat which was strange, unusual but delicious. All this with a bottle, or 2 or 3, of Morgan Double L Pinot and then some chocolate mousse and more wine at the end! The food was amazing but the service is unparalled and I have been to some extraordinary restaurants. The flow of the service went from the hostess, to the Sommelier, to the waiters (uh, 3 per table?) and just extended to all aspects of the entire experience. We were greeted at the end of the evening by the valet who had left a hand written note and a box of custom Kai chocolates on the dash of our car thanking us for our business. I mean if that's not class and superb customer service, I couldn't tell you what is.

The sommelier Chris, is one of the most subtle and low profile wine experts I have ever met! I had fun talking wine with him but was in awe of his vast knowledge! The store has a great selection of fresh products, gourmet food and good quality staple items for cooking. I go for the cheese, garlic, olive oils, but I always come away with a tip or idea from someone in the store or better yet. a great wine pairing idea. Great girts for foodies too! Just overall wonderful place to shop if you take pride in what you serve/prepare.

I stumbled upon this in town hotel as I was searching for pet friendly places to stay overnight. Funny, I pass it al the time and just never really paid attention. My room came to $188 on a Tuesday night but it was a nice stay. The front desk person was friendly and helpful. They offered my dog a treat bag. In the room, there was a microwave, 2 tvs and plenty of space to lounge around. As all hotels it seems, it wasn't very quiet to outside noise, but there was hardly any. They featured a continental breakfast, Wi-Fi, room service, and of course, pet friendly areas and accommodations. It is right next to the mall so convenient to everything in Chandler pretty much.

I love PF Changs. I have never had really great service in Tempe but the location in Chandler always has terrific service. Large menu, lots of yummy and different things to choose from. The staff seem to enjoy themselves a lot. I heard one waiter telling his table that he has been with the company since 2001. Their egg drop soup is so good and you can eat off the lunch bowl menu during the day and your entree comes with the soup. We had the egg rolls today and our waitress prepared a sauce at our table-medium and it was amazing! The drinks and desserts are really good too. You can go here for a special occasion or just lunch. Most likely the manager will pop over to make sure everything is ok-and most likely, it will be!!

This is a great little lunch place and the service is fantastic! There is a nice lunch menu, good prices, TVs, lots of seating and the staff is always energetic and friendly. I am not a sushi person but my friend loved what he ordered off the sushi menu. The menu is HUGE and there are so many different and unique plates. I like getting the mixed tempura or a teriyaki dish. It's also pretty quiet and laid back. We always get in and out quickly too.

This place has stood the test of time. I've been coming for years. I wouldn't say I am a regular, mostly because the service is mediocre. So you never really know how your visit will turn out. The food is good. I can say they don't seem to change up the menu really. But they do offer daily specials and have a great decor inside. There is ample seating, it's always clean and cozy. The outside fire pit on the patio is one of my favorite spots in the cold months. They serve Guinness and Jameson so until that stops, they are one of my "go-to" spots for dinner!

Thus far, all I can review on is the lobby bar and pool! My date and I went there for a nightcap. The drinks were very strong and they had the more exclusive alcohols. Always a plus. The lobby was crowded with glamorous people, but also some laid back guests of the hotel. Nice to see that the service was great to all. The grounds are amazing. We sat in the gazebo beds and looked at stars and walked down to the fire pit by the pool and chatted with another couple. I will definitely be back to experience more!

So I can't complain too much about watching the Angels play in 84 degree weather, BUT where they play, I've definitely been to much better stadiums. The concessions are very minimal with the lines forming in the sun, in other words there is no shade or relief from the sun almost anywhere here. There are lots of tables,although no open seats, but again, all out uder the sun with no cover. The food was good, burgers, hot dogs, the normal stuff. The bleachers have no cup holders so that was a challenge. And yes, my kid did kick over the kid next to us snowcone, it was ugly. We bought the poor kid another one. Scenery wise, looking at the traffic forming on the I-10 was NOT such a good view, but the Buttes next door is nice. There are really no bars or anywhere close by to kind of hang out before or after the game. Maybe Top of The Rock bar? Parking is a joke. We heard about it ahead of time and got there an hour early. But those poor suckers that didn't walked at least a mile or 2 to park in nearby office parks. I saw so many people getting lost after the game roaming around trying to remember what plaza they parked their car at! It was $5 to park but the gentleman collecting money did point out that it was going to charity. And then he high fived my son. :) It took 35 minutes to get from the parking lot to the street after the game. They really don't have that situation planned out very well! The gift shop had a ton of Angels stuff which I thought was awesome, but again, it's just a tent of sorts, no store to go in and cool off for a few minutes. The staff in the gift shop hated their jobs it seemed but elsewhere in the stadium, people seemed really friendly. I don't know, could be that it was St. Patrick's day and I wasn't drinking? Ha! Bring sunblock! GO ANGELS!!

Thank God I took a chance and called a random glass company based on their reviews!! I JUST got my windshield replaced 2 weeks ago by Safelite and I will NEVER use them again. So when my windshield broke again, I started looking for other companies. Roberta took my call and couldn't have been more helpful and understanding. She even got my insurance company on the phone for me and answered most of their questions so there was very little I even had to do. I requested Lexus specific glass from the manufacturer and they were able to have everything DONE in 2 days!! Safelite took 2 and 1/2 weeks to do the exact same thing! The tech was super friendly and professional. Just all the way around an easy, convenient experience. I hope this doesn't happen again but if it does, I won't call anyone else!

I've always loved this place. It's like a landmark of Phoenix. Over the years, I've just become fonder due to the nostalgia of the place! It has such a presence downtown. And even though some other hotels have gone up over the years in the same vicinity, this is still probably my fave! I recently got away for a little stay-cation and this was the spot I chose. The rooftop pool is on the 3rd floor and it is a little small, but it caused guests to talk to each other and interact which may not happen at a resort with a huge overwhelming pool. While there is no waiter service at the pool, they will bring you room service up. We ordered a bottle of champagne and some OJ and sipped mimosas until the sun went away.   The interior of the hotel is breathtaking. In my opinion. All the decor and furniture just perfectly placed to create a spectacle of luxury. There are conveniences such as kiosks for key pick up, online check in/check out, business center, fitness facility-oh did I mention The Compass Room? Maybe one of the most noteworthy Phoenix spots! I don't care who you are, the view from The Compass Room restaurant is impressive, something not to be missed. ESPECIALLY if you already live here and have never been.   The room was nice, modern and upgraded. We had a room with a private patio that overlooked the street from the 7th floor. It was incredible!   Of course the service was every bit what you know of Hyatt. Very friendly and top notch. And don't forget how fun the elevators are! I dare you not to say "Weeeeee!!" as you head from the top to the lobby!

Ok, not the cleanest place ever but it is Phoenix. Still, lots of party supplies, costumes and the quirky unexpected things that you can't find anywhere else. Pretty organized inside. They have areas arranged by them so it makes stuff easy to find. I went there for a Mardi Gras party and they had plenty of decorations, beads etc. I have found noisemakers for NYE and even novelty items. The staff is helpful when you are looking for something specific. They seem to enjoy the fun atmosphere and are friendly. It's a big place and it's been there a long time! I guess if you need to find "fun" stuff, you know where to go!

I disagree that this place is average. Well not the menu anyway. I was really impressed. Definitely not average bar food. The atmosphere is decadent, yet relaxing and friendly. I went for lunch and I have also been at night. Perfect location to just drop in and hang out, have drinks on the patio and people watch. Or after a couple cocktails head up to the Compass Room for a dessert. This is one of those downtown landmarks that I may be partial to, but I happen to love!

So we ordered from the office for about 4 people curbside service. Lots of food and stuff-hence the, bring it to my car window so I don't have to get out and try to carry all this shit! When I got there the was a car taking up both curbside parking spaces and there was no one in the car. So I called the restaurant to let them know there was nowhere for me park. The hostess literally sighed on the phone and said "I guess I can. We don't normally do that." I was like I am literally outside but the take away parking is occupied and there is no one even in the car! She's says, "Well don't you just want to come in then?" I'm not going to even finish with the food that was ok at best because her attitude pretty much sealed it for me.

You would have a hard time finding this place and probably would not be impressed with the decor, Mr. Wong has been hemming my pants and jeans for years! He promises me that one day, years from now, his shop won't be there anymore. On that day, I suppose I will have to go somewhere else. Until then, I bring him my Juicy, my Lucky, my lined work pants, etc. and he gets them done quickly and precisely. If it's not broke, don't fix it and Wong's works! Prices are very reasonable, work is excellent.

My friend suggested this place based on the filet and the singer. Well the singer we expected wasn't there. But the filet? Touche! The crowd this particular night, was...of the elderly/senior citizen type range. But honestly, it was kind of different and fun. No snooty Scottsdale bimbos or night club douches. Just happy couples dancing, sharing drinks at the bar. We sat in the bar/lounge area and listened to the jazz singer. Also a senior citizen! lol But again, fun and refreshing! He sang Sinatra and Dino and chatted up the audience. I don't recall his name. The lamb chop appetizer we started with was delicious! One of my favorite "every day" wines, Silver Oak Pinot was a nice accompaniment. They also offered us a fresh batch of "potato chips" as a snack and they were awesome! These were NOT Ruffles! Yummy. We had salads after the appetizer. The filet was very good, presentation of the food was very nice and the prices were reasonable.  Probably $100-$125 minus the cost of the wine. Our waitress was wonderful. Very friendly and patient. Very attentive. The hostess was helpful in trying to let us know when the singer we were wanting to see would next be performing. So overall, this was a great restaurant for a casual cozy dinner. I wouldn't say you're going to meet someone you can take up to Pussycat Lounge with you-or maybe, who knows! lol But great food, service, and envireonment. Try it out!

My "foodie friend" insisted I try this place and has been talking about it for a very long time! We went today. I had to park in the back which is surrounded by an unsavory residential area. So parking was my first concern. The restaurant inside was quaint and nice. For such a highly acclaimed restaurant, I wasn't at all impressed with the service. I was not greeted. Since I was meeting my friend, I decided to just look around myself. I understand that this is not an On The Border or "traditional" Mexican food as soon as I open the menu. Unfortunately, that's the kind of Mexican food that I like! No chips and salsa. Isn't that a staple at any Mexican restaurant? They served bread, which wasn't even good. Very basic bread like what you could purchase at Basha's and some type of chili/tomatoe spread. I skipped that. We ordered guacamole which was awesome. Too bad the chips they served were so dry and bland. Again, in my opinion the guacamole would have been so much better on the thin salty chips that I am used to! I was starving so I decided to get adventurous and order something that sounded somewhat familiar. I ordered what I thought would be a simple chicken enchilada. It was a mole sauce, which I had never tried before. Not a fan. I had just a couple bites. This "mexican bitter chocolate" sauce had no place on food at all, but I've heard a lot of great things about it, so maybe it's just my personal taste. My friend's pulled pork was delicious, had a couple bites of that. I've obviously realized by now that this is Mexico City type food and not traditional "beans and rice, chips and salsa" type food. The meal was served with a side of very soggy vegetables-again, not typical vegetables that you would even want to eat, so I didn't understand that either.Is this a side? Is it a garnish? Is this creative? What the F I am hungry!! I had a bite of what I think was zuchini. It was almost like they were soaked in oil and steamed. I would have loved to have spotted and better yet tasted anywhere in anything we ordered some cilantro, some green onion, but no such luck! Again, I realize that a lot of people probably love this restaurant. Just putting my review out there to help those who have not been be aware of what kind of experience they might have. I would never go there again.

Went for dinner on a Sat. night. I made reservations 1 week in advance and when my friend and I arrived to check in for our table, we were handed a pager and told we could go STAND in the bar area seeing as how there was no place to sit and have a cocktail. Not real sure why I bothered to make the reservation. About 40 min later we were taken to our table where there was NO ONE else seated at first for the Teppan cooking.Kind of a bummer. About another half and hour and more people were seated. It's only about 10 pm now and my friend is literally starving. The bar area is a joke. Maybe I just don't go to Scottsdale often enough but are these people serious?? There were maybe 4 guys under 25. The rest were in their mid to late 40's. The women were about the same age probably but wore outfits like they thought we wouldn't know how old they were if we just focused on the sparkly sequined shirt and puffy skirts. Or as my friend said, are these ladies re-living prom night or what?? Anyway, food OF COURSE is so over priced and where you think you might get 4 of an appetizer, you get 2. Nothing real special about this place. Once you look beyond the decor and focus on the "scene", service and food-Thanks, I will go to Hon Machi!!

Turkey burger. Best anywhere. I've been going here for years. Whenever I am in the area, I have to eat there. The 2 go take out service is really good but for some reason the wait staff, not so much. Still hands down, one of my fave places to go for a burger and fries. This is NOT In n Out! MMMM!

Sometimes finding a restaurant that actually stands out in Vegas is tough! There are so many!! I can't say I've ever really had a bad dining experience in Vegas and I have been to some of the best places to dine there! This one, perhaps my favorite. I was staying at the Wynn for my birthday. We were arriving that evening so I wanted something in the hotel and a nice dinner that would appease my snobby food/wine side and my boyfriend's finicky side. Mission accomplished! The entry into the dining area is above a beautiful winding staircase. The place just oozes elegance. It was like a birthday gift having my waiter be from Dublin and I got to listen to him talk all night! I wish I could remember his name but he was the best! The fish case was a spectacular site and although I am NOT a seafood girl, my bf is and he ordered the scorpion fish. Watching them prepare it to be plated at the table, picking out the bones and adding vegetables and sauce right in front of us was amazing! I almost wanted to try it, but no thanks. I went with, you guessed it, the filet. By the way, one of my favorite dishes and this one was probably in my top 3 anywhere!! Including the grass fed filet I had in a castle in Ireland! It was that good! I only wished I had more room in my stomach. After salads, bread with butter accompaniments, entrees and then a special dessert for my birthday I was full until lunch time the next day!! This restaurant was sooooo amazing, I would literally go back to Vegas just to eat there again.

This is a very unique bakery. A couple of times now I've received cupcakes as gifts of congratulations or thank you. I think they make a great gift especially if you don't know what to get someone! Everyone loves cupcakes! The baked goods are not what you may be used to. They are not going to taste sweet and processed with a lot of sugar. The ingredients taste fresh. I love the coconut! Mmmm! They also offer breakfast and lunch! A little hard to find and to park but worth it. Something different and fresh and delicious!

So...I haven't even started the actual repairs to my Audi yet....but that's the GOOD part! Based on my experience so far, I know my car will be cared for and taken care of the same way I have been which is amazing! The service I have received is way beyond what I know any other place would give and beyond I KNOW what they even have to provide. I came in with my nightmare (see Berge Mazda review) and without even beginning the work, they have already earned the highest review I could give! The communication all the way through the process so far is outstanding. They explain what they need to do, why, the best way to do that, what my options are and the different scenarios involved. I bought a car and within 6 months, it's undriveable. My frustration is overwhelming but Mike has helped to advise me on talking to the dealer and the warranty company (niether of which handled anything correctly at the time I bought my car-SEE BERGE MAZDA REVIEW!!!) so I can get my vehicle repaired with the extended warranty I purchased and with as little out of pocket expense as possible. From all the positive reviews, I see I'm not the only one that they go above and beyond for but that consistency in service is not easy to maintain! Everything Mike has told me has been true and accurate and honest. They are professional but friendly and down to earth. I called in when Mike was out and Joel knew exactly who I was and my situation. The personal attention they provide is such a relief-especially considering what I have been dealing with! I know as long as they are there and as long as I have a vehicle that I need repaired, I will never go anywhere else!

This is one of those restaurants that you will probably never go to...unless someone tells you to go there. So I am telling you. Go. It's so different and unique. You have to go with an appetite because the menu is large and inviting. I mean, the appetizers section alone could satisfy me for dinner. We tried the Focaccia and Peasant Platter. But the rest of the menu, especially their chicken plates, is amazing. I had to debate between pasta, which I really wanted to try and the caper chicken. It was fresh and flavorful and the portions were huge. Next I want to try the pitas. The menu is so authentic and the environment is casual yet special. You feel like you will never go to a place like this again, and that's because you probably won't! I went on a date and it was so surprising and not what I was expecting. It's a little pricey, but I feel, well worth it. This is no chain restaurant! You could go for lunch with friends or a nice dinner and that's what I love about this place. I will keep going back.

I can't believe I've never been here so I finally made a point to go!  Ambiance is great. I was on a date but I could have just have easily had a dinner with anyone here and it would have been perfect. The menu is not elaborate but very creative. My friend ordered the pasta and they offered to split two dishes for him so he could sample both. Great wine list. Not the best I've seen but you can definitely find a nice bottle.  Mark up is going to be ridiculous of course so find one you like and then get it at AJs or Total Wine.  The service was prompt and friendly. The table next to us was doing Grande Marnier flight which was different.  Dessert which we never skip was delicious! We had the mousse. I had the Scotch beef.  It was so tender and flavorful,  it just pulled apart on my fork. We also tried the pizza as an appetizer.  So good!  It was dim and quiet.  Some music played and there were plenty of servers.  Overall very nice place. Prices are a tad high comparatively.  Filet was about $49. But if it's a special occasion or, you're not paying,  definitely recommend! !

I love the "Trend Setter" area of Nordstroms!! Kind of the young womens department. The labels are better than the teen department, BP. I go looking for Michael Stars, Splendid, Calvin Klein, Free People and Michael Kors. The staff is always friendly and professional. They make really good fashion recommendations which I love cuz Lord knows I don't have any on my own!! I recently had a dress that I loved shipped to my house in my size and I didn't even have to ask. She was already putting in my address because she knew I loved the dress but that store didn't have it in my size! They're great!

I can't find one good thing to say about this particular store. I've been in a handful of times and if the service isn't poor, the selection definitely is. I've never found one piece of clothing in excellent condition. Most of it is poor to good at best. I've seen shirts hanging with stains, stitching that's unraveling, clothes that is old or outdated. The very worst part to a brand name snob like myself is I have seen brands such as Old Navy, Mossimo and Xhileration (Target!) hanging. If you want to market yourself as a high end designer resale store, might want to improve the offerings you have for sale. And to the women that have the lady balls to act snotty  while working in a consignment store, please remember. I am bringing you my ACTUAL high end brand clothing that I don't even WANT anymore. Please adjust your attitudes.

I've never had anything bad here. The service only suffers a little during the lunch rush but both times I had bad service on the phone, the manager personally delivered my order with his appologies and a coupon/discount off my next order.That's what keeps people coming back to your place. (Owners-write that down) Their food is delish! And I am always mixing up my sandwiches, changing breads,toppings, etc. They've served up to 10 people in my party before and still got all of our orders correct! Their sandwiches are very different and imaginative. And did I mention delicious?? The Irish girl in me loves the Corned Beef sandwich! Mmm! Getting hungry! I know where I am going for lunch tomorrow! Oh! Treat yourself to the cookie for goodness sake! You deserve it!

This was kind of an unexpected find. I was perusing local hotel rooms for $100-$150 and this one popped up. I was not the payer or booker but I did enjoy the stay! Yes, the rooms are smaller and kind of average as far as amenities but they have been nicely updated and HULLOH there was a whirlpool bath in our room! Bath salts provided, get some shampoo (or bubbles if you actually bring them) and it's actually pretty nice! The décor is chic and the the grounds were nice. The bed was horrible so bring your ibuprofen. I got up at 5 am from the pain in my back to take a hot shower but for a nice moderately priced hotel, this one gets a nod from me. It's close to Old Town so we went to dinner and then the store for beer on the way back. Couldn't really figure out the HBO or cable so much but watching TV in my room is not a top priority for me anyway. Before we checked in, we sat at 7s Bistro next door and had a glass of wine. I'd stay there again. Not bad.

This was a good experience for me. I took my kitty, Ireland in because of a cold and I was told it was not serious and I didn't HAVE to purchase medicince unless I wanted to. No upselling, no panic tactics to get me to spend more money. There was just an exam charge and all of the staff was very friendly and took good care of my sneezing kitty! The cold did go away on it's own as the vet implied so I am glad I didn't purchase antibiotics. Kitty is a Humane Society animal so they were very good at checking her over and making sure she seemed healthy and thriving. There has been no follow up since the visit, but other than that, very good service. Easy to find, convenient location, good parking, clean office.

This is one of those places that doesn't get enough acknowledgement! It's been here for years. Businesses have come and gone in this particular plaza and yet, after 6 years, they are still there. With a simple idea but one they are passionate about and so it shows in what they do. I've tried many different things here and have never had anything I didn't love. The Colada Cooler is my fave. The smoothies come with 2 boosts. Like calcium, energy, immunity, ginseng, etc. They also have great Acai smoothies. They have juices and yogurts too. This place tastes better and has more selection than any of those OTHER juice smoothie places!

Do you love wine? And chocolate? Or both together? Need I say more then?? I first stumbled upon this glorious place while shopping in the Biltmore. I mean, who (ok maybe just us females) would NOT walk into a chocolate store  that also sells alcohol! You can sample off a tasing menu and sip a luxurious cocktail or take something to go like a box of chocolates. This I probably don't need to say makes for an amazing date or just something different and special to do! I got a Valentine's gift this year from Julia and LOVED it! Can't wait to go back again! Check out the website to really get the idea!  http://www.juliabakerconfections.com/

So it's probably not very fair or objective, but hey, first impressions, right? I went over for a slice for lunch around 1 pm. I've always noticed that this place does not provide much space to sit or hang out and I thought the 'lunch crowd' might have died down by then. Not so much!  There was 1 girl passing out orders and taking them. She was super friendly and upbeat though. I had to be the girl to point out there was no ice in the soda fountain but she was more than happy to hop up there and put more in. So considering that there was only 1 person behind the register and a ton of patrons, say maybe 20? It wasn't a bad experience. I waited about 10 min. from the time I walked in to when I walked out with my slice. Pizza slices are ginormous which is always fun and better than every other place with just regular sized slices, right? However; it was mediocre pizza. I mean, I definitely prefer, Buonos, Pestos or Barros for this area. Thin floppy, greasy slices are not what I like in a pizza, but I would like to go back when I can sit down and spend more time checking everything out. It's always busy so maybe I need to give it another shot. It's not like pizza can ever be that bad, right? Like sex? Even when it's not that good, it's stil pretty good!! Jimmy and Joe's, you're all right, but unfortunately, "I've had better!"

I'm starting to get the impression that you are not supposed to expect a good experience when working with a car dealership. Everyone I talk to is like "Oh yeah, that's dealers for you." What?? I wish I had known this!! The story of my experience is long. That's mostly because I went in to this dealership in Aug., they didn't complete my financing until late Sept. and it's October and I still haven't received my license plates! I had to go to the MVD today, wait for an hour, pay the replacement fee to get my new plate, because I figured that was easier than dealing with this dealership anymore! There were one or two involved in my experience that were pleasant and seemed somewhat genuine. The rest, were shady at best. They would dodge my calls, tell me anything to get rid of me. They had my vehicle that I was trading in-PAID FOR and worth more than the car I was getting from them. Twice I had to threaten to come get my car from them if they could not close my deal or call me back with real honest answers about the loan they were trying to finance me for. Only then, did I get anyone to get back to me. They tried to get me financed through a bank that told me on the phone I didn't even qualify for the type of loan they were trying to get me! The whole process took almost 5 weeks, the whole time, yes I had their car, but they also had mine. And the money that I was supposed to be receiving back from the deal!! This whole experience was more of a nightmare than I ever could have imagined. It's unfortunate that one business and one group of sales/finance people can ruin your opinion of what should be an exciting thing! I had a Lexus before, went through the Lexus dealership 3 years ago and I had a great experience. Too bad Berge. You've lost a customer for life!

I came in to this store after having one of the worst weeks. Phone stolen. Bank card stolen. Fraudulent charges to my account. Yep. One of those. I couldn't have been very pleasant. Dan assisted me and helped me figure out what I needed and made some great suggestions for options I could use. I made the mistake of stopping in on my lunch though and unfortunately that didn't lend enough time to complete everything. I returned after work around 6:30-waaaay too busy. The next time I came in was on my day off and Ricardo helped me pick up where I left off. There were a couple really grumpy impatient people complaining about the wait and he was very friendly towards them. They found me a used Galaxy S5 at another store and the manager drove over to that store FOR me to pick it up and bring it back. I was perfectly willing to drive on my own but that apparently is a service they offer so I didn't have to use my own gas. The process was long yes, but I've never been into a cell phone store that didn't have a long wait. Overall, I got what I needed and will be saving money every month. Can't beat that and great service goes a long way with me!

I am "one of those" girls-spa whore, whatevs. Anyway, I've been to my share. Especially in Vegas. This one, not my fave. I was surprised at how long the walk was just to check in. Soooo much wasted space and time just trying to make our way to the lobby. No attendant to walk you or direct you, just walk forever, read some signs, you'll probably find it. It started way before this though. My boyfriend and I had a few treatments scheduled specifically at the time we needed and everything strategically planned out. One little hiccup and the whole thing was a debacle! I had to get on the phone with the spa manager just to sort everything out because the person on the phone was so confused. She ended up cancelling everything, rescheduling for the wrong services, then the wrong times. What a mess! Their policy is you pay full price for the service whether you have it or not so when talking about $385 services, I was quickly losing my patience. As I said above, once there, there was no real service. I had a lady in the locker room show me how to work the locker. No attendants to escort you, show you the amenities, nothing. Just here are some shoes and a robe. Way less than I would have expected-ESPECIALLY for the price I was paying. I could go on about the massage and more lack of service and attentiveness but let's just say, I won't go back. There are too many other places in Vegas or near my home that will exceed my expectations for sure!

I guess a restaurant with a 4 Diamond rating doesn't need another review. I've been to a lot of fabulous restaurants, mostly in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and I always rave about a great restaurant. I can honestly say that our waiter made the difference for me here. This guy looks like he was a 20 year old scene kid with some of the craziest hair I have seen. And he blew me away with his knowledge of wine, regions, vineyards and history when totally caught off guard. He was prepared for every question we had, topic of discussion. He proceeds to modestly share that he worked for The French Laundry. He was sooo attentive, so friendly and his presence and skill at his job just left me in awe. Seriously. Anyway, to the food. We were brought a bread basket with some very unique spreads and butters. Try them all. Hands down the best filet I have ever tasted. Pepper crusted with a bernaise sauce. My friend wanted to order the Wagyu like we've had before out here for about $10 an oz. $34 an oz here! No thanks! The bison tenderloin he chose was a perfect substitute! Food, wine, desert, service is going to be amazing. But the views are incredible! Make time to sit at the bar to check out the city!

I saw a bad review which really surprises me. I go there often, but wouldn't call myself a regular. I don't know any bartenders' names or anything. But, I've never had a bad taco, bad service or bad anything ever here. The crowd always seems chill. The patio is nice. I like the red lighting. Good for street watching too. Their food always tastes fresh and their salsa bar is very yummy! Tequilas-great selection. I believe Herradura is one of my faves. I say, can't go wrong with this spot. If you like a casual fresh Mexican kind of sporty type bar with a lot of modern touches and nice staff, don't see why you wouldn't enjoy!

A friend recommended this place when I was craving a breakfast burrito. Meh, not that great. Just your basic breakfast burrito, nothing super special. I had to ask for a customized burro and ended up not getting everything I ordered on it. It almost feels like a cafeteria more than a restaurant inside. Casual is kind of an understatement. Felt a little dirty, Plastic tablecloths that smelled of mildew and less than adequate dining furniture. Oh well. It's been there a long time so maybe I am in the minority here!

Ok, I did not go here by choice, but because my former company decided this would be a classy place for a Christmas party, I can at least maybe spare others!! The show was funny and entertaining, yes. And yes, I did get pulled up on stage-I had to can can kick like a Vegas dancer. It was the food and the service that left the "bad taste" in my mouth. Now maybe a diner on Van Buren should not raise anyone's expectations, Orrrrrr....maybe you could try that much harder because you're a diner on Van Buren!! They didn't. Food was about as good as what I remember of hospital food. The servers were wrong, confused, unprofessional and didn't seem to have the simple concept of "service" down, but again, show was kind of cool. Skip this place if you can! There are too many other places in the area to even waste on meal!

This restaurant was amazing. The service was pretty good. A little forced with their manners and courtesy but they tried and were attentive. Very young and maybe even a little inexperienced staff. However; the food made up for anything that could be construde as a negative! The atmosphere was also nice. A little too bright inside I thought. We ordered based on the waiter's recommendation, the lobster tempura which was $68 but so delicious!! Presentation was incredible on everything. The tempura asparagus was a great compliment to our beef entrees. My friend ordered the Japanese Wagyu meat which is highly exclusive and was priced at $10 and oz. So amazing though we both had some and thought it was worth it! They served it with two salt dishes, a black lava salt and white truffle and they accented the flavor perfectly. I ordered the filet that came with a chili ginger sauce. Also delicious! The meal was amazing, presentation and serveware was beautiful. Their wine list really surprised us. We did have to correct the bill at the end as they charged us $130 for a bottle of Roar which was featured on the menu for $90. This would be a place you could take your girlfriend for her birthday or someone you want to really impress. Best Japanese food I've ever had, hands down!

Honestly, the food here was decent. But in my opinion when the service is so bad, sometimes it overshadows the menu! This is that instance. We waited 20 minutes to be greeted at our table. Another 35 for our salads. And our waiter was so arrogant and distant that my manager actually left him a note saying "it appeared we were bothering him by being there" Anyway, the waiters and waitresses seemed to be more concerned with each other in the back corner of the restaurant, but unfortunately in plain sight of patrons, than they were with their customers.

I rarely rate anything 1 star. So I promise, this is not an exageration. It was really just this bad. I see that some other people have had the same experience so I would think twice about coming here. Don't say you haven't been warned! As some others, we came here to watch the fights. It's free, there's lots of seating, generous parking, and they had a pretty good menu. There weren't too many people and a lot of staff, so naturally, we thought service would be prompt and friendly. Not so much. We waited for everything. For a waitress. For the drinks we ordered. For the napkin I asked for. For the menus so we could order. For the waitress to come back to TAKE the order. By the time we placed the order, we just ordered 2 more beers each since our glasses had been empty...during a 3 hour fight...for about 15-20 minutes. Now if servers were walking around serving people, taking orders, delivering food, etc. then I could understand. But the waitresses were literally standing in the corner, 2 or 3 or 4 at a time just hanging out and chatting while we waited to flag someone down to get a refill! So wait. I am getting to the best (or worst?) part. We ordered food. Should be a pretty easy task. I kept it simple so I thought and requested a burger. Medium to medium plus please. Just no blood, I said. With a smile. So after waiting (we had gotten used to this) my boyfriend got his food. I was still waiting and then my burger came. On a soggy, wet bun. Not done. Red and bloody. EKkk. Ok, no big deal. With a smile again, I asked if they could just cook it a little longer. The cook (who the manager told me was "new") microwaved the burger, lettuce and all,  through it back on the same soggy disgusting bun, and then served it to me! The outside was tough and charred, the inside, you guessed it. Still red. Lettuce now wilted. My boyfriend ended up asking our waitress if SHE would eat that, to which she made a grossed out face and said Absolutley not! This story basically ends like this. Manager comes over, appologizes, does not offer to take the food off my bill but I had to ask. She asked if I wanted something else and by then, the fights were almost over and we were definitely over this place. It's just too bad that this was my first experience here. I'm sure they probably don't screw up that bad every time, but for me, one time is all I care to risk.

I don't know why I have never reviewed this place before! (I almost feel bad!) They have been around for a while and I swear, it seems like they are just getting better! I have to say, the service and ambiance is great but the food, hands down, is the reason I go. I'm not even a big Greek food eater but hummus and pita is one of my most favorite things EVER! This place has the BEST! I've gone for lunch, dinner, they have wine, they have an adorable patio setting. I meeeaaannn, what else can you ask for? I love the grilled shrimp entree, lamb, salads, appetizers, etc. I just need to go more! Om nom nom and healthy too! :)

There is nothing more convenient than having your drycleaning delivered to your apartment or business. At my office, many of the residents take advantage of the free delivery and have their orders delivered. Clothes arrive pressed and on hangers. Prices might be a little more expensive than some of your local independent places, but those also don't have the staff or capability typically to accomodate such a luxury. So in my opinion, worth a little extra money for the convenience. If you're like me, it's hard to work full time + commute and then try and get your clothes in before they open or close. Organic has friendly employees and a helpful staff. If it helps the environment, which some are skeptical, well even better.

I have never had a bad meal from here. I can't say the service is quite up to par considering the menu, interior and pricing, but sometimes the food is all you need to be won over. This restaurant is within walking distance from my work and when I have gone for lunch, I have never had to wait. The host is professional and poised. Unfortunately, the hostesses are not as much. But again, you can quickly look past that. The menu has already changed at least a couple of times which makes the dining even more fulfilling because you can keep trying new things! The food is definitely not average or casual cafe style, yet you can find things on the menu such as homemade chips, baked macaroni and cheese and a buffalo sloppy joe. The bar is beautiful and they have live jazz on Saturday nights.Great for a business lunch, a romantic dinner or tasteful happy hour.

Ok, let's just forget about the food cuz I only had one thing and it sucked and that's not why I went. So DH gets a free pass on that for now! The first time I went, they had the NHL draft on which I thought was awesome!  (Not enough people are into hockey in my opinion!) I was with a bunch of Polar Ice guys so it was a lot of fun. But the REAL reason you go to Dark Horse is definitely for the Karaoke. It's one of the best song selections I've seen-ahem Wings and Rings down the street could maybe take a hint! Good crowd. Wide variety of "talent" and the MC Karaoke master is like a guy out of The Wedding Singer but you gotta love him! Service is not the best. They seem to take care of the regulars a little better. Still if you're looking for a good time on a Friday night, I highly recommend!

The best thing about this "bar" was the band and the chick bartenders that were nice and made a great cosmo. The worst thing was the actual bar itself. It's so small, and there's not much seating. I guess it's a cool idea. Upstairs, dark, small. Lol, but I thought the bouncer or whatever he was-door guy seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe cuz he was stuck outside on the stairs all night. The people there were mostly rude. We did manage to kind of create a dance floor where there wasn't one and then it got fun. But again, not a lot of room to dance. We went on a Sunday night. So perhaps a Friday or Saturday would have a different vibe and crowd. Overall kind of fun for a casual drink or maybe a good place to have a couple drinks before you go out somewhere else. ; )

I've been coming here for years now. It's a wonderful experience, especially if you are looking for something different or for your out of town guests. I go to the mimosa station or my favorite, the omelet station where they prepare you an omelet on the spot with the ingredients you choose. All this while you shop a couple local vendors and boutiques. I am able to pick up a couple specialty grocer items and pastries and baked goods to take home. The restaurant (Vincent's) is open for seating. It does get cold in the morning. There's hot chocolate and coffee, pets are ok on a leash to stroll with you. Love this place!

"Hidden" is almost accurate, it's more...unexpected, location wise! But who cares! This is one of my fave Italian places right now. Mainly because of the food! I've been a handful of times so far, the service is not terrific but usually predictably decent and friendly.But the food has been consistently great! I've had the shrimp scampi a couple of times, the Italian sausage with the spicy Vodka sauce-Fuhgeddabawtit!! Amazing! My guy usually sticks with the classics like spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna, but I've tried both. Yum! Wine of course is average supermarket wine but it complements their food well enough. Bread came out cold one time, but hey, I need to eat less of that anyway! Bar seems to be fun and friendly but there are plenty of TVs throughout. It's always busy when I have gone but you don't have to wait an HOUR like at Oreganos up the street and I promise the food is just as good or better!

I tend to agree with Shannon M. I thought the idea was great and definitely a cool place to stop but the food was nothing to boast about. Pretty average. They did have a good beer list and I was able to grab a Nitro Milk Stout and my guy an IPA. We brought a couple friends for a ride during bike week on a Saturday so I don't know if that's why it was so crowded but the line to order was really long. We all got burgers and fries. Pretty generous portions and there luckily were a lot of tables so we had no problem finding a place to sit. The atmosphere was great as we got to "bike watch" (when you like bikes more than people) and even caught the notorious Cave Creek sports car display. No one minds watching a 911, R8 and Ferrari pull in.  (wipes drool off lip) So overall this is a great place to take in some lunch on the weekend. I'd go back again if we rode up that way and see what else is on the menu that I might like.

Thank you Willows for opening a boutique sized store at Biltmore Fashion! Just the perfect amount of samplings from the main store on Indian School. The store is beautiful and elegant, but unlike many I've been to, it's not snobby or pretentious. My favorite thing is T-shirt Tuesday where Michael Stars T's are 20% off! The moment you enter, the environment and atmosphere calms and relaxes you. There are so many lovely things that you experience with all of your senses. I love this place for candles, special serving pieces and luxurious comfort clothes. Great place to find a gift for someone! Anything you buy is a treat!

So if you sing The Humpty Dance on karaeoke people DON'T like that?? Not such a fun crowd. I think my table was just way too fun for everybody else! Well, if you pick a Journey song, of COURSE we are going to help you sing! Duh! I personally loved our rendition of You and me baby ain't nothin but mammals....everyone else, not so much. Whatever. I had fun. Food was average. For my first time, wasn't so happenin'!

The best part about working with these guys today was the constant communication. Normally I don't require stating and re-stating of a plan but I couldn't help but appreciate how thorough they were with contacting me. John called once in the middle of the move to see how everything was going and then again after they were done. And the initial call I made to schedule the move, which was the day before due to my scheduled mover backing out, was equally thorough and informative so at the end I knew exactly what my price was going to be. Before they actually showed up they also called me to let me know they were on their way and were there exactly at the time they projected. They introduced themselves and did everything they said they would do and asked questions regarding my things to make sure they were handling things they way I wanted. The fees were definitely not as expensive as other companies I checked with but were still about what I would expect from a reputable, legitimate company. There were 3 guys for the hourly rate and 2 of them definitely needed a bit of time to "warm up" and come out of their shell but overall they were very friendly and easy to work with. My stuff arrived safely and in a reasonable amount of time. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how quickly they moved me out of my 3rd story apartment! They had all the supplies and even were able to sell me mattress covers at a WAY cheaper rate than going to the Uhaul store. On such short notice, I am definitely glad that I found these guys! I will probably need to use them again in the near future!

I , like Chris R, am excited for the new watering hole next door,but I am not as impressed. The service is average, so is the food and the patrons, because they all seem to know each other already, lack that friendly enthusiasm-more like watching TV at your uncles. I had a chicken sandwich and a couple beers on a Sunday and it was just that-a chicken sandwich and a couple beers on a Sunday! However; I am going back to give it another chance because I can WALK home! ;)

This place was very basic. There's no spunk no flair and nothing that seperates it from any other place, plus it's small inside. And parking is not that great. I just feel like, I would go to Orange Leaf that's maybe 5 minutes away. They did have a lot of toppings. But the yogurt flavors were just your average, chocolate, vanilla, fruit. Maybe I am getting picky on my fro yo, but with so many of these places sprouting up, shouldn't there be something special about a store?

Don't let the fact that this restaurant is located in a casino deter you!! There is nothing cheesy or "restaurant casino" about it! I'm talking primarily about the food. Service is good. Restaurant setting, nice. Seating, plenty. Blah Blah Blah. Anyway! The menu is very creative for Asian food. I love the pepper steak prepared with friend rice, asparugus and mushrooms. We ordered the sampler appetizer with the traditional pot stickers, crab wontons and coconut shrimp. It was delish! The menu is fun and extensive. F'in loaded sliders, the F stands for filet mignon. They have lunch portions which helps since the food is a little pricey. But I am a firm believer in you pay for what you get! This is definitely one of my favorite Chinese places ever!

I've been coming by this place for years. The owner and/or staff are nice and friendly but it's reeeeely not a very good resale place. I buy expensive, never from an outlet, name brand kids clothes and I bring them in in great condition. I never leave feeling satisfied with my exchange. Like not one time. I continue to find low budget cheap brands like Mossimo, Old Navy and some brand from Wal-Mart (I don't shop for clothes at Wal-Mart, I had to ask!) I bring in Quicksilver, Under Armour and Abercrombie, barely worn and they pass them up. Every time. I will come out with less than $10-$20 which is not even worth the trip. I don't know the last time I bought something from them, it's been a while. Their selection is usually worn, dated and brands I would never dress my kid in. But they do have a nice shop. I like that they have dressing rooms and sizes even up to 0 and 2 so I can shop for myself from time to time. The prices don't really reflect the brands. For the money and the experience, I think I'd rather go to Nordstrom Rack.

This is a great boutique in a great area! I walked to Paradise Bakery after dropping an undisclosed amount of money in this shop! The store is clean and well arranged. I got a lot of outfit ideas from the owner who was very knowledgeable about fashion and trends. She was friendly and complimentary. There were some pricey high end items like Rock Revival, True Religion and then more affordable pieces to compliment. Also nice accessories. I picked up a very unique necklace which my hot Fed Ex guy loves! That's worth the price right there as a good ice breaker ladies! wink wink I got on the email list and also got a follow up call telling me that I had left my sunglasses, ooops! and thanking me for stoppping in. You may have to save up to put together a full outfit or two, but I would definitely recommend if you are ever in the area!

Ah, the dreaded broken arm on an 11 year old boy! You guessed it. Monkey bars. I was at work! So this did not happen on MY watch! But anyway, a friend of mine in the medical field referred me to the Orthopaedics department, Dr. Greg White. It was difficult-VERY difficult trying to schedule an appointment over the phone and I found myself waiting for several minutes, becoming impatient and then calling back to try again. Well my relentless dialing paid off and I'm so glad. The hospital is so organized and streamlined in their processes, from the parking garage to the elevators, every step of the way, we were greeted, assisted and guided. They even have a automatic appointment confirmation call that reiterates directions and your apt time a couple of days before your set appointment. Onto the staff. I wish I could remember the names of all them, because each one was so helpful and patient. Adam gave ME a sucker because it was my birthday! And he had my son cracking up, anyone that has a kid knows how important it is that your kid is treated well!! The nurses that assisted with Scott's cast were great and very funny and sweet. Everyone genuinely seemed like they loved what they were doing and every kid that walked through the door. My son was probably the oldest the couple of times we were there, but there were some little kids, screaming and crying getting casts on and the staff never let out a sigh and just gently took care of all of them. I'd have to say Dr. White was my favorite part of the experience. From insisting that my son was going to get a pink cast because that was the only color they had, to cracking jokes about his monkey bar skills. He lightened the environment and we found ourselves laughing, smiling and having a good time in what could have been a very uncomfortable and scary situation. He explained every step of the process, he kept me informed and put my mind at ease when I would start to question or worry. He even told me that he would be doing the same thing if it were his own child's arm, which really helped me to feel at ease. We have another appointment coming up and I am honestly excited to take Scott back there! He loves it and so do I!

I should have done this so long ago, but we forget our Doctor's need reviews too! I've sent my boyfriend, my family and my friend's to her. You should know about her too! I've been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years! She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright, smiling, genuine and just overall warm! You want to thank her and hug her at the same time. Her staff is professional and friendly. Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job. I've followed Dr. Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else. She's helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed! What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is! I take my son to her now and he isn't afraid to go in. Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well, and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!

I don't eat this type of Chinese food. Normally, I'd go to  Changs or Pei Wei but I needed delivery to my work. They were fast with that. However; I could not understand the guy on the phone. At all. So naturally they did mess up the order. Even if they hadn't! I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, thinking that would be a safe entree. It was the most bland thing I've ever eaten. No flavor, no vegetables, no pineapple or anything I would expect. Just a cup of some sweet and sour sauce that I could pour on top of the no flavor breaded white and dark meat chunks of chicken and white rice. The fried won tons, same thing. Just bland no flavor meat. I had to put those in the sweet and sour sauce too just to eat a coupe. Did not try or eat the soup. I was over it. $11 for those 2 things. Wish I had just gone to Pei Wei.

I work in customer service for a living. I eat, breathe and dream it. One of the hardest things is when someone walks in around oh....10 or 15 minutes before you are about to close your door. What can you do. I force one more smile and treat them as if they are the first customer of the day. That's the industry I'm in. Last night I went into AT&T about 15-20 minutes before 7 knowing exactly what I wanted and ready to leave with a new phone. I don't think this sales guy could have been more dissapointed that we were there. I had a couple of questions that he couldn't answer as if I was speaking Russian. I literally had to ask my friend to disect and explain my questions for me so that he could understand them. Anyway, the worst part is they locked us in and when I asked my friend to please grab my water from the car, they wouldn't let us!!! They said if we leave, we can't come back in! It's an "auditing" thing is how the manager explained it. And by "explain" I mean her snippy rude response to my question "Uh...we need to get OUT please?" So you're telling me, rather than sell one more phone to a new customer tonight-which is the very reason you come to work every day-you'd rather close at 7pm. Obviously we left. They unlocked the door luckily. And I got a drink of water and no new phone. Weirdest display of company policy I have ever seen.

I guess this place isn't aiming for high customer service but any level courtesy and friendliness in a business where customers come in and pay you for a service is at least warranted. That aside, for getting what you need, it is much easier than going to the MVD but don't get confused. There was still a line, a wait, cranky bureaucrat style employees who shout your personal information across a small retail pad shop lobby in front of everyone else there instead of taking the time to privately consult with each customer. I had to get duplicate tags for my registration which was $12.00. At the MVD it is $5.00. So I guess in a way you are paying for the convenience. Just don't expect anything special or to be in and out quickly!

As most reviews of this place state, the food is fresh, healthy and amazing. For us gluten-free seekers, there are many options that satisfy on the menu. The inside is large and spacious, casual. Service is not great, but this place also gets pretty busy around lunchtime. If you don't like vegan or vegetarian, this is not the place for you! There are no chicken sandwiches or turkey burgers here! I love the fresh smoothies, but they are quite pricey. Smoothies come in a mason size jar with a straw so this means you're getting a very small glass for about $8. But it's one of the only places of it's kind in our area. So if fresh, different and healthful is what you are craving, you will enjoy.

I've never edited a review I have posted before, but this one is worthy! I had a bad experience when I was first went it but this was quickly resolved by the owner. It takes 30 seconds to make a first impression and rarely does a first impression change once it's made. Not so in this case. Everyone has "off" days sometimes and the way I was treated the second time I went in was more than enough to compensate for my initial experience! The owner asked me to give his salon another chance and I am glad I did! The salon is clean and bright when you walk in. Also, there is a lot of parking in front of the shop which makes it very easy to make it on time to your appointment. (Sometimes difficult in the downtown area!) At the front desk, they are friendly and offer you water while you wait. I didn't wait long , maybe a minute or two for my technician. She was amazing! Frida has been doing pedicures for years and I got a nice introduction to her and background which I thought was great! It helped me to relax knowing how experienced she was. She asked often during my pedicure if the pressure was ok, the water temperature. I appreciate being asked if everything is ok so they can adjust to your comfort level. The owner personally came by to offer more magazines and check on me. He happened to be there that day, but I also  get the impression he takes great pride in the service his salon provides and is very involved in the day to day functions. My pedicure looked great and felt amazing when it was finished and has lasted through days of being shoved in very high heels and lots of being on my feet so far! They were very attentive to me personally and made conversation about the event I was getting ready for. The owner even complinted my pedicure after it was done. Every girl likes to be complimented! The salon has a wide range of professional services and prices are reasonable. I am looking forward to trying more services there, they are close to my work and I came out feeling refreshed and relaxed! The owner walked me to my car and thanked me. That kind of service would make anyone feel pampered and valued and that's what you go to a salon for!

Yeah, I'll be the one. The idea is fun I suppose. But even a good dive should have at least something going for it. So not the people, not the service, definitely not the music-they have a lot of seating? Yeah because there was absolutley no one there on a Friday night. Stay weird Duce people. No thanks.

I've been meaning to try this place and got the chance to on a Sunday afternoon. It was only moderately busy, which was nice. No lines. No waiting, table to eat at. I liked their selections of yogurt flavors. All the delicious expected ones! Chocolate, Cheesecake, Coffee, Strawberry, Kiwi, Pineapple, Coconut. Looking forward to creating new treats! Fresh toppings. You get to build your own here so the possible comninations are overwhelming! But overall, very simple idea. Store is clean, modern, trendy but there was a good variety of patrons there. Staff consisted of a couple unfriendly teen types, but oh well. Yogurt was delish!

I loved this place! The food was great but the people and atmosphere really made the experience. I loved the burger I ordered and the onion strings! Everything was simple but delicious! Definitely a fun, casual place for burgers and more with very nice people and great service!

This place is awesome! For bowling, drinking or eating! But the bowling is a plus!! The ambience and colors inside are fabulous so you feel more like you are walking into a club than a bowling alley, but very cool. The menu is WAY better than it has to be. You should not expect traditional pizza and fries at this place. The bar tender Teddy makes great drinks and Buddy, well I don't really know what Buddy does, but he's very friendly! This is a great place for a date, a double date, a party or even for happy hour. The hosts are not overly friendly but that isn't that surprising. Overall fun and beautiful! Good times!

I've been back several times since my first review! One of my favorite places to eat for sure! The menu is amazing! Sunday brunch is great! Football, food, mimosas. Prepare for a wait most likely but I usually get right in without one.

I first tried Spinato's in 1997 when it was a hole in the wall in an industrial complex buried in Tempe. It really wasn't a restaurant at all. More like a secret pizza establishment that only the lucky few knew of...yet the line was always out the door around lunch time. Now year's later, I work right down the street from the Ahwatukee location and STILL remain a loyal, faithful customer who is convinced that you just can't order anything like it anywhere else. My first experience was the famous spinach pizza. I can honestly tell you, I had never eaten spinach before and had I not tried that slice, I may never have! Today I like to try different pizzas as well as their other dishes too. Tonight I ordered the Nicole's favorite but I get it with ricotta instead of feta cheese. Oh mah gah! So amazing! Calzones are huge and so soft and fresh. Salads are perfect. I can't think of anything this place can't make right! If you are looking for something south of Bianco and with a twist, check it out. It's even worth a drive I'd say.There's a reason their spinach pizza is "famous". Oh. Don't skip the chocolate chip cookies on your way out. Trust me on this.

Hey! Do you love bread?? You: Why yes I do!! Do you love really stale, tasteless bread? You: Love it! Wait, do you like eating plain, bland sandwiches and cold, soggy hardly cooked bacon with just a drop of mustard so that you can't even taste it and it just seems like you're eating a dry slab of meat and bread? You: Oh my gosh, YES! That's my favorite, pile that sh*t on! Ok last question, 2 really bad cafeteria quality sandwiches and the delivery driver will forget part of your order and have to come back, around $25.00 seem fair?? You: Totally!   Ok then, Jimmy John's has you covered!!   Oh. And by the way. If you ever deliver me food again and don't bring me NAPKINS, I will have your soul!!!   I'm out. (Drops mic)

I love the downtown location. It's not like there are a lot of sit down Asian/Thai places in the area. It's just as hard to find parking of course as any other place in Downtown Phoenix, but well worth it. The food is great and they have a very expansive menu! I love the simple stuff like Thai Basil with Chicken or fried rice. Ingredients taste fresh and have unique flavor. The service is good and there is indoor seating. They deliver sometimes, but if they are super busy, you may have to go pick it up. They serve a lot of dishes with Jasmine rice and theirs is perfectly made!  They have desserts and the ice creams are UH-mazing! Green tea and coconut?? Oh ma gosh. This location can be nice even for a casual date or lunch meeting. Can't wait to go there and try something else!

It's not like you can find a good cheesesteak place in the valley, right? Yeah you can! It turns out! Who knew! I loved this place and the food was great! Prepared fresh right when we ordered. They even have Thrifty ice cream (which is the BEST) so we tried to save room for our huge scoops of that. They explained to us what they offer and how they prepare it as well as their recommendations for us. I had the cheesteak with onions and peppers. They put a white cheddar cheese sauce on the bottom and then flip the meat over on top to cover it. Oh ma gosh! So good! They serve onion rings or fries and also feature other food like burgers. I haven't gotten a chance to try their other food yet but I am sure it's just as good! The restaurant has a small patio and adequate seating inside. It looks like an old diner or coffee shop inside. Very cool find! Different than your chain restaurants and great service too!

I loooooove breakfast and the atmosphere and food combined that TBC offers is one of a kind! I went on a weekend morning in October. Perfect weather, sat outside in the courtyard seating area of the restaurant. It was fairly crowded so the service was a little slow. We had to ask for things a couple times. The mimosas were expensive and not that great but the food is. Having a leisurely breakfast Downtown is something most of us don't get to do because of week-day work schedules, so I definitely recommend spending some time there if you get the chance. I had the Belgian waffle with strawberries and a side of bacon and my guy had a huge southwestern burrito. They were both terrific!

I've only been here for lunch but both times were great! Jeremiah is awesome. Attentive, funny, patient and makes terrific recommendations! My first time I had the marguerite pizza and wedge salad. The salad was creative and fresh. Pizza was too thin and kind of soggy for my taste, but still tasted good, especially if you like thin pizza. The other day for lunch I tried the grilled chicken sandwich. . The menu is typical but there are a few creative things that stand out. I've never had to wait and the waiters are very attentive and friendly. The interior is surprisingly roomy, casual, comfortable, very clean. Good place for a business lunch or casual dinner. I plan to go back a few more times. They are now serving brunch too!

I have been a patient of Active Health since it opened. I come in regularly for adjustments, health and wellness strategy and massages. There are not enough good things I can say about the entire staff and the overall experience I have each time I stop by. The appointment times are flexible and generous and they even provide Saturday hours. Most doctors are golfing on the weekends but mine is in the office treating patients whose busy schedules don't always allow them to come in during the week. The front office and reception area is friendly and professional. They know most patients by name and remain energetic and pleasant throughout the day. The office is clean and very organized. They have state of the art equipment and areas for physical therapy. One of my favorite machines is the rolling massage table! It's like a bed/massage chair in one! Dr. Neufang has big balls. The kind you find in the gyms, for exercising. He also encourages me to stretch and has demonstrated a variety of exercises and stretches that I can do at home. He promotes a healthy active lifestyle which I resist a lot of the time but he always gets me back on track with my eating, proper posture, etc. He hikes, plays softball and is a great example of healthful living which makes me feel good about coming to him for treatment. I've known some Dr's that even smoke which is such a contradiction to their philosophies on medicine! The staff at Active Health is genuinely caring and incredibly knowledgeable. Each one seems to contribute something unique to the office and makes it an all encompassing one stop health shop! Spine health is probably the most important and valuable attribute that I would want to have as it is so crucial to the way I feel and function every day. The Doctors, especially Dr. Neufang, at Active Health don't just treat your symptoms. They educate and teach preventive measures for continued health. Dr. Neufang has never tried to urge me into an appointment that I did not ask for or sell a service that I wasn't in need of. They make you feel like they care about your health and even better, celebrate when you feel better. How many medical professionals today are happy when you DON'T need them as much!  I've even had questions on my insurance coverage and copay and the wonderful girl at the front desk was more than willing to explain things to me. She is super intelligent about the inner workings of the office and it shows. Dr. Neufang always treats the staff and his patients with the utmost respect and kindness. He has been in his field for a very long time and it's refreshing to see someone that has not become tired of their career or the job they do day in and day out. I'm thankful that I have never needed physical therapy but the patients that I have seen during my visits seem to be very pleased and leave feeling better than when they came in. As long as this chiropractic therapy office remains in Ahwatukee, I will never go anywhere else! I hope to be coming to Dr. Neufang when I am a little old woman! :)

I arrived and signed in and with no one in front of me. The lady called me and one other girl and took her in so I kind of stood back and waited. Then she came back and called 2 other people. I asked the other lady at the front desk if I was supposed to follow her. I think she was new but she told me to just sit tight for a minute. Another 10 minutes went by and I brought to their attention that I was still waiting and I had already been called. Then they were confused as to what I was supposed to have done. ( A simple drug screen) They had no phone for making outgoing calls to find out what type of test I needed. They couldn't find the forms I needed. The lady that originally called me up kept mis speaking and say the wrong thing. Just seemed really flustered and disorganized. Another lady came back from a break, her lab coat was completely wrinkled and she was on her cell phone in the front. Very unprofessional place. Glad I won't have to go there again!

World?? Maybe a small village worth. A little acre of land of beer. NOT a world. Not only was the service horrible, the beer menu was not at all impressive. In fact, it took probably 3 or 4 tries to find something they had. I would have been fine with my go to Guinness but they didn't even have THAT! And my boyfriend trying to ask about their IPA's, it was like a bunch of  dumb blonde deer in half shirts looking into headlights! He even asked the owner/manager/seemed to maybe know a thing or two guy about his favorites and what he'd recommend and he was too busy counting money to even fake a conversation. About beer. At a BEER bar! Whatever. No thanks Tempe. Go home "World of Beer"-you're drunk.

The menu and food here was great! The service, was horrible! I think for a sandwich shop downtown, you should be able to work quickly, be friendly, not get flustered however; the staff the day I went in had none of those things going for them. And worse, were very un-apologetic for being so! I repeated my order (a simple turkey sandwich) to 3 different people and 4 times total. As I repeated it a 2nd time to the 3rd person, she said "Ok, I got it!" when I repeated it louder than the first time I told her. (My fault apparently) Then we waited for them to figure out who had what sandwich, one came out before the other (my friend's) The whole situation was way too frustrating. But unfortunately, I loved my food so I will most likely go back and hope for a better experience!

This is one of my new favorite places in Chandler for Mexican food! Even if it didn't have great service food and drinks, the restaurant is beautiful! The patio is amazing, decorated with lights and wrought iron fencing. Very rustic and old world Mexico. Large pillars, tile work, stone and old wood everywhere. Great ambiance. But I do love the food! Not your typical combo #6 with beans and rice! They have fish tacos, pork verde and steak entrees. The appetizers, like the Mexican pizza, is enough for dinner! I like their nachos, piled high and loaded with fresh ingredients. I usally grab a taco plate of some kind. The carnitas are amazing! They have a great tequila selection and happy hour specials too. The bartender offered me up a sample of their habanero tequila. Which is just a blanco tequila in a large jar with habanero chilis! Ay Carumba!! Careful with this one kids! It's not meant to be  a shot! The servers are friendly but not the best or fastest I've had. The bartenders I know, Mike and Gary are very helpful and friendly. Overall nice place for good Mexican food where the chips, salsa and margaritas flow!

I have been wanting to try this place for sooooo long. Just needed someone to get up early on a Sunday and come with! It was after noon when we arrived (Sorry, I hate mornings!) and it was quite busy but there is a lot of seating so the wait time was expected to be only 20-30 minutes. We opted to sit at the bar instead where you can select off their Breakfast Cocktail menu (whaaaaa???) and enjoy dining there instead of having to wait. The morning cocktails are nothing less of fabulous. Traditional mimosas OR, one's with pineapple juice, or with tequila instead of OJ and then each one has a little special twist to it. Ours were very blah and mostly just juice so I asked the bartender to add more alcohol. She did so that was nice. Her service unfortunately was not so hot. She just seemed like she didn't want to be there and that we were just a nusiance to her for the most part. We had to remind her and wait quite a while to get water that we asked for and to place an order. I would have rated it higher based on the food and drinks but the service was just less than mediocre. So then I go right to, well I can just go to TC Eggington's or BLD for great food and at least the service is typically friendlier. I would probably go again if in that area but I can't see going out of my way. The breakfast menu itsef was pretty impressive and I went with the OMG french toast but it didn't blow me away. Not quite as much flavor and sweetness I was expecting but still a very nice dish. He ordered the Benny Goodman which was an open faced breakfast sandwich with poached egg and salmon and asked for sauces/accompaniments on the side. Not something I would ever want to have but he seemed to like it. It's a nice place. Great area. You can browse around the Rack or hop over to Biltmore to shop after. But I am big on being treated like you want me there and want me to come back and they, I can honestly say, did not!

This place was such a nice surprise! We were craving Italian but so many good restaurants are closed on Sundays. Nook, OPEN and 1/2 off bottles of wine! There were a few TVs with baseball on which was great. The environment was laid back but casually elegant. In other words, with the right person, this place can be either romantic or fun or both! We started with a charcuterie board which featured, some nice meats and 2 cheeses, olives and spreads. Very good. I had a mixed greens salad with red wine vinaigrette. Very fresh tasting, simple but good. For the entrees, he had the Diavolo pizza. It wasn't amazing but pretty good when I tried a bite.I like my pizza a little crispier. I had the chicken marsala which was very good. It was made with Gran Marnier and you could taste the sweetness through the marsala sauce. Everything arrived promptly. There weren't that many people there but a few came after we did. The waiter I think was Ralph and he was very friendly and helpful with the menu. The wine list is nothing special but there are a couple good ones. The one we tried was the Yangarra Grenache which we both felt was flat with no lustre, no finish. But at least it was half  off.  I know the bottles of wine were half off that time on Sunday so I am curious to see what other specials they have as I'm sure I would go back.

After all of the bad reviews I read on here, honestly, I went just to see how bad it was. Luckily for me, it was pretty nice. However; I went on a Tuesday, in the afternoon and hardly anyone was there. I also hung out at the bar, not upstairs. So here's what I think about my experience. The bartender was a friendly, chatty readhead and she was attentive to us. She helped us remember when happy hour was about to start so we could take advantage of the specials. The food was amazing. We shared a beer board which consisted of beer sausage, beer cheese spread and beer bread. A little on the bland side but pretty good. After our Guinnesses (which they have on tap. Thank you!) we had their specialty drink called Jamie's Boone. Served in little copper cups, it's basically Jameson with ginger beer and crushed mint leaves. Yum!! My boyfriend had the green chili pulled pork and I had the smokehouse burger. The rooftop is a nice idea but you can already see where the sun and weather has worn things like chairs and cushions. Don't know how many people would really be up there from May-September, but hey, I guess if you're trying to be a trendy hot spot (ahem, it's not Downtown Phoenix, but ok) you gotta have a "rooftop bar" Whatevs. One other bartender was kind of friendly and talked to us, but the servers seemed to lack enthusiasm and didn't have much going in the outgoing department.  Overall, really cool place to hang out. There weren't many people there so I can't attest for how douchey it may get on the weekends. I knew where this place was but if you are not familiar with Downtown Chandler, you WILL have a hard time finding it. Best bet is to park where you think it is and just start walking around. Good luck!

I have only been here for about a month, but so far, so good! I haven't really checked out the amenities too much yet but the things that DO make a big impression on me are: the amount of pet waste stations! Great to have if you're a dog owner. And lots of grass and trails for walking and "business" The landscaping and grounds are always neat. There was an issue with the front gate but it was repaired timely. My apartment was in great condition when I moved in. I have used the grills and picnic areas and they are working, kept up and clean. For those who take these things for granted, trust me! There are communities that DON'T make sure these simple things are tended to. I've only had minor work orders and they were fixed right away. I have a garage and a quiet apartment that offers Valet Waste (which I have always been a fan of) and a friendly office staff. So I'm happy!

DAMN YOU BURRITO HOUSE!! YOU ARE DELICIOUS AND NOW I MUST RETURN!! I found this little spot out of pure hunger and geographical location and from the outside, ok from the inside too, you really wouldn't think much of it. It's tiny inside. Not intimate. Not private. I could do lunch here. CASUAL lunch. They do have good beer selections. But just from the tacos I ordered-carnitas-I KNOW I have to go back and order again. The chips and salsa was so good it's what I ate for breakfast soooo...I will come back again and wait in a line and watch your slow outdated methods of ringing up orders just to get another taste! This was a good find for exactly what they serve. Some of the best tacos I have had anywhere. And, we are in Phoenix!

I don't know what all this crazy talk about Kneaders being better than Paradise Bakery is but I think not! Not only did they mess up our order and not give us everything we paid for, the sandwich I got was no where near as good as Wildflower, Paradise or even Jason's Deli! The chicken pesto panini was so bland and lacking flavor that I didn't even eat it. The chicken was just a thin piece of flavorless meat that didn't even cover the length and width of the bread. Next time I'll just go somewhere that I know instead of coming here again.  I'm afraid to try anything else on the menu.

Ohhhhhh Fractured Prune. I have NO idea what your name means but you have won my heart. This shouldn't even be referred to as a "doughnut" store. They are little delicious poofs of cake in your mouth!! On a good day, I can throw back 2 of these bites of heaven in one sitting. (Or maybe that's on a "bad" day cuz I sure feel like a glutton afterwords.) For those who have not already experienced the Prune, you can order off a sheet of either pre-designed donuts, OR, you can create your own! You select your glaze and your toppings. My favorite custom doughnut is a chocolate glaze with coconut and sweet sea salt. Oh ma gawd!!! Yeah. You're welcome. Anyway, I order off the list sometimes too. They feature things like OC Sand (om nom nom) Salted Caramel, Death by Chocolate (whaaaaa??) and Cookies and Cream. You can order a big box of a dozen or like I do, just stop in for a quickie and eat one (or two!) there. There's seating inside and out and the best part of course is that you get to watch them makes these fresh to order right in front of you! Oh sweet baby Hey-Suse! When your donuts are ready, they are warm and dripping with sprinkled toppings that are like Christmas in your mouth! Today, I had my dog in the car and waited outside, but those doughnut angels delivered my box right to me! I am actually kind of glad that there are only a couple of locations because if this place was closer to my house, I'd probably weigh 200 lbs. Just sayin'. Ughhh. Just scarfed down 2. I need to lie down.

This place was a little hard to find but the sweet Robert Irvine look-alike British guy was very clear with the directions so I was able to find it. Overall, they were very friendly and helpful and anyone that owns this brand of vacuum knows, you simply HAVE to take care of it right. Good thing this place is around! No charge for diagnosing my clog and fixing it up for me. Now that's unheard of!!

So I rate bars/restaurants/ on a few different things. Obviously, food is a pretty important element of a restaurant. However; the place itself seemed very cool to hang out..if you don't want to eat. :) They have oversized Jenga like you've seen at Dos Gringos, they have corn-hole, lots of seating, lots of TVs and indoor and outdoor areas. The wait staff was somewhat efficient but not friendly. I asked for a water and never got it. (I assume because that was not a paid drink) The guys in the kitchen looked dirty and unkept with long hair all over the place, piercings, and no form of uniform to tell them from the patrons. The women behind the bar were so scantilly clad that I felt more like I was in a gentleman's club than at a restaurant. If I had gone there with my son to eat, we probably would have had to leave because of all the ass cleavage and toe being flaunted. Gross. The food, steak and chicken kabobs, white rice, and mashed potatoes was so bland and void of seasoning if I wasn't starving, I would have left it. The "appetizers" of chips and guac were stale, the pigs in a blanket were a little beneath my expectations and something I think I could have made at home. Oh well, not many places in that area stand the test of time and I predict this one will probably be gone soon too. There was one guy, I think the GM, that was very helpful with the TVs and spent time trying to find the game we wanted to watch. He was awesome. Everyone else kind of seemed like they didn't want to be working.

This place is beautiful on the inside!! ...And then there's the food. Lol. My friend and I went here for dinner. It was a Sunday night and pretty dead so we were seated right away. The bar area is nice but we opted for a table. It had nice views overlooking the lake BUT, anyone that knows Ocotillo knows that smell is NOT so nice! Even with the misters on, it's a hundred degrees outside. I'm not sure why they kept the large patio doors open. So anyway, the atmosphere was great. Candles lit and dim lighting. Could be very romantic and posh but, instead of Bocelli or Sinatra they were playing Smashmouth and Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was so "off" for this type of establishment. What made it even more awkward, was our waitress kept dancing and signing near us like we were in a club. Not very professional for such a nice place but again, whatevs. The wine list was not impressive at all. In fact, we both had a really hard time deciding because there was so little to pick from. I mean, I've seen a couple of these bottles at Target, come on. Since you can order by the glass, we did since buying a bottle of something they had was just not going to be an option.   I ordered the chicken vodka penne. My friend ordered the Godfather pizza and we had a Caesar salad. Right away when the food came out, we both kind of looked at each other surprised and he said to me, "Uh, that was fast. There's no way they cooked that pasta just now" I agreed. The pasta sauce was great but the chicken was dry and I kept thinking, it was like it was made for something else and they just cut up and tossed it in my penne. The salads were delish though! I had a couple bites of his pizza. It was pretty good too. I would probably go here again just to see if my experience would be different and to try something else, but it's definitely not living up to it's potential.

I've only been once. Today for lunch. But how much can ingredients really change (or improve) from one visit to the next? I'd probably still go back to try something different, but my review for now was Meh. In my opinion, if you are all fresh ingredients and the only meat you serve is added to improve the salad, it should be good, right?? I ordered the Asian Salad with chicken. Not only was there VERY little chicken, (Not even close to enough to accompany the salad) the quality and taste was analogous to any fast food restaurant that prepares a salad. That's NOT a compliment. (Sorry Wendy's) The lettuce and ingredients were tasty and fresh but overall, it was still just an overpriced fast food style salad. I'd rather just do a take out order from a restaurant.
