Ate here last night on the recommendation from a friend and the solid yelp reviews that I saw for their happy hour and specials Sun-Thurs.  The simple answer is that this place DID NOT disappoint.  We were greeted at the door and felt welcome from the hostess, waitress, sushi chefs and even both of the owners all in the first 5-10 minutes.  We explained to them that this was our first time and we asked what they recommend.    They told us about the buy a Kirin beer and get a discounted appetizer so of course we did that (twice).   We tried the crunch scallops and the jalapeno boat and both were delicious.  For sushi, we went with the scallop dynamite, spicy tuna and a las vegas roll.  My gf is trying to avoid carbs as much as possible so we asked for no rice on the spicy tuna.  The sushi chef didn't blink an eye and made the roll with no rice and it was delicious.  He explained that he had no problem making any roll without rice as long as it wasn't a specialty roll where he needed the rice for the toppings.  The manager checked on us multiple times and even offered my gf a sample of a new wine that they had just added to their menu.     With 3 drinks, 2 appetizers and 3 rolls of sushi our bill was only $40 which I considered a very fair value.  I'm sure if you wanted to avoid alcohol and just go for sushi you could eat for two people for under $25.   They had a large selection of rolls on the happy hour menu that ranged from 3.50-5.50 which is awesome.   I didn't get a chance to try any of their specialty rolls but will definitely go that way next time to venture out a little bit now that I know the fish is fresh.  Also, another interesting thing that I appreciated was they have 3-4 specials each night and they actually make the special and put it on display at the front and on top of the sushi bar so you can see exactly what you would get if you order it.  I haven't seen that in a long time and it was a welcome sight.  Add everything up and this place has taken the top spot on our sushi spots.

Had lunch here the last two days and very impressed.  Nothing fancy just a solid sandwich shop that blows away subway any day of the week.  The fresh bread and veggies really make the sandwiches stand out here.  Good pricing and highly recommend.

alright let's be real for a second....if you live in north phoenix, this is the go to spot for sushi.  Granted the ambience isn't the best, but for take out fantastic sushi this is the only spot you need to know about.  I've been to every spot in north phoenix and this place completely trumps J and K sushi over on 7th street and bell.  I have got take out from both places numerous times and let's just put it this way, I won't be going anywhere else than HANA from now on.  All you need to get here is the spicy scallop roll or the rainbow roll and you'll be in sushi heaven.

Just a simple straight forward review here.  Came in around 11 AM by myself for a quick lunch.  Ordered a mini shrimp ceviche tostada and mini torta norteno de res (carne asada).  Tostada came out within minutes and was perfection.  Cold, clean, fresh ceviche which was a perfect snack.  Torta came out piping hot and fresh.  Added some salsa and chopped jalape√±os and it was perfection in my opinion.  Just a nice clean spicy torta.  Bill was $9 plus tip.    Highly recommend anytime

First time checking out this place and would give it 4/5 stars.  It was packed with the lunch crowd but line moved quickly.  Ordered the wreck and it was solid, much better than Quiznos but same style.  $5.25 or so for a regular sandwich so you won't break your bank.

This place is legit.  I have been there 3-4 times and had a great experience every time.  I usually go with the sliced brisket (not on the sign, just ask for it) sandwich.  Brisket has been spot on every time.  The owner has personally came to my table to ask about the food every time which is a rare thing these days.  I need to try the hot links next time!

First time there, asked about a certain chefs special sauce and was immediately offered a sample of the sauce as well as an actual sample of the wing!  Who does that????  Very impressed and ordered what I sampled and it was amazing.  I asked for a little spicier and they nailed it.  Highly recommend

Not sure what's up with this place?  I have driven by 3-4 times in last two weeks to get some wings to take home and it's been closed every time and phone is disconnected.   Not sure if they haven't got everything up to speed yet or what their issue is.  Perhaps the owner can respond here to let everyone know what's going on.
