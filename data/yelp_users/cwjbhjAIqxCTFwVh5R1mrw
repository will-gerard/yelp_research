The front staff was very nice and professional. I took the day off work specifically for this appointment. As a new client, an expectation is an exam, x-rays, and cleaning. However, after twenty minutes into my appointment (x-rays and exam were done-- and I was very happy) I was informed that I had to reschedule my cleaning, because the hygienist was with another client and then leaving for a personal appointment.   If they were unable to accommodate me, they should have never scheduled the appointment. It gives me the impression that this chain wants to get as many people in as possible and doesn't have respect for the time of the individual person.   Yes, it was only two hours of my day. It was great to know that I have no cavities. But I still have no cleaning; the whole point of going to the dentist. Now I have to wait until Western Dental submits the claim to my insurance stating no cleaning was done so I can re-book this appointment with another dental office that will provide thorough care--taking away more of my time (and as a very busy person, I value that immensely).  I do not normally write reviews; however, I feel like in a time where dental offices are a dime a dozen.... I wish that someone had written a review about this office, so I could never have booked the appointment to begin with.    The two stars are for the front desk, and the limited service I did receive.

My boyfriend and I went during AZ restaurant week for our first experience. The ambience, drinks, and food are amazing! I still have dreams of the duck meatloaf :) If you like cocktails I would definitely recommend the seasonal mule-- best I've ever had! Would definitely recommend this as a date night place or a night out with friends!
