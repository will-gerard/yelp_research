I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.  I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...  The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.  The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.  There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.  There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.  A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.  Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes.   Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.  There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever.   I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.  Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!

Holy smokes. Words hardly exist to describe our experience at this place.  This was the third place on the list for our limo to take our bachelorette party, because I'd heard that it was only to be visited while trashed. Also, they had a mechanical bull. Additional bonus: I was told we were likely to be the hottest people in the place.   How could this go wrong? Well, being the hottest group in a place is simply not all it's cracked up to be. Other reviewers mention being completely freaked out by everyone around them - this is entirely true, and a diplomatic way of saying that beer goggles cast no positive light on the ugly mugs surrounding you.  I'm all about the common person getting their party on. But the common folks as a group usually include some average people, some below-average, and some above-average. The crowd at this place made it seem like there were bouncers at the door who kept out anyone who looked average or better.  Our group came in costume - 80's clothes from the Prince era - and when we might've looked like a hot mess at other places, we somehow didn't stick out at all in this joint.   Creepy men - ones old enough to be my dad - asked me to dance and actually proposed to me on the dance floor. One guy with such heavy vodka breath practically spit all over me on the dance floor and incorporated a move I've never experienced before - he grabbed my glowstick necklace with his teeth and shook it around like a dog with a bone.  The "normal" people were kind of like folks you'd see at a work function or company picnic - in khaki pants with pleats down the front and tucked-in polo shirts and cell phone holsters on their belts.  The 80's room dance floor is shaped like a circle and has 2 cages. When they're populated, they're usually up to some silly over-the-top 80's or 70's dance moves. It is really fun when some strange people are totally into it and have the "up with people" vibe with such enthusiasm. Think of a dance floor full of girls like the "Flight of the Conchords" biggest fan.  It's about as harmless as a gay bar in there, except that's where I was proposed to, so you do have to have a sense of humor. The wierdest part is the 50 year-olds, with very bad fashion sense, booty-dancing with each other. There was also a man who looked to be about sixty who was spastically running in place in a cowboy hat and tennis shoes while his face went through epileptic siezures. Many folks like this were there - people who decided they would be "hip" by wearing John Lennon sunglasses with reflective lenses or something. If you stand too close, one of them will fixate on you and begin dancing in your direction.  The hip-hop room is a rectangular room with four cages on each corner. An orgy was occurring in one of the cages. Three girls who looked like they were from Scottsdale (somewhat thin, in designer jeans and holding Gucci bags) decided to go ASAP - As Slutty As Possible - and grind on each other in the cage. This was going as you'd pretty much expect, until it took a turn for the worse.  A tall white-trashy looking girl, who looked like a very cheap stripper, was hanging out below the cage. She had long wavy, frizzy blond hair and glasses, and was wearing an uber-short pleated skirt and black tank that showed her midriff, and a thong. She decided to reach her arm into the cage and started rubbing one of the girls' crotches over her jeans from behind, before she decided to jump into the cage.  She jumped in the cage and began VERY aggressively grinding/bucking on the girls - because she was so much taller than them, they were easily pushed around. I watched one of the Scottsdale girls talking to her friend about "How to get out of this" while she was being essentially banged from behind by the stripper chick. They were knocking into each other, stumbling like dominoes in the cage.  At some point, the Scottsdale girls reluctantly and slowly caved in until the stripper chick threw one girl's back up against the wall and started jackhammering her like a dog on a leg. By now, the cage was surrounded by guys who could no longer keep it together, and hands started reaching through the cage and grabbing anything they could grab.  This scene continued on for about 20 minutes and escalated until a large body builder guy with a shaved head jumped in and took off his shirt and sandwiched himself between them all. He had a large asian-font tattoo across his back that said "JESUS."  Security showed up to break it up ... only because the guy had taken off his shirt.  My friends were propositioned by dad-aged men, some of whom would invite them home by standing behind them and staring, wordlessly touching their arm repeatedly until the bar closed. Since it seemed so normal, it made me wonder if it's also normal there for a girl to respond by jumping in the stranger's car after the last song.  It was more like an anthropological experiment than a normal night out on the town. If you go, expect culture shock.

Bill knows what he's doing, he replaced all the a/c hoses for us so we have cold air in our Westy, he knows that R12 is the right refrigerant to use in these old vans and that anything more modern will expand more than the old system was made to handle. He rebuilt a 2.1 engine for my van in 3 days so we could leave on time for our camping trip. To save us money, he put in a free (used) transmission, which unfortunately failed once we got out of town and started leaking transmission fluid everywhere. It was a sad story, bro. But he footed the bill for us to get towed back to Phoenix from Camp Verde and fixed our van so we could get back on our way.   He took our van to get its windows limo tinted (an AZ necessity) one time when we were getting all sorts of work done on the camper's interior. Our tent came back with holes in it from someone who popped the top and closed the latch inappropriately (fabric: not supposed to be closed inside a latch!). He couldn't verify whose fault it was but he offered to install a new tent free of charge, and it's a time consuming task.   He makes it right if something fails to solve the problem we came in for, and my van is from 1985 with about 200k miles, so figuring out the cause of a problem can be a real mystery. You want to make sure that your mystery problem-solver knows what they're doing and doesn't cut corners and call it "fixed" inaccurately. A point of comparison - I took it somewhere else once or twice and they solved our problem by removing the O2 sensor altogether. They said we'd like the extra power anyway. Well that was nice, but the air pollution wasn't so great and the 13 miles per gallon we got wasn't a very good value. Plus, it turned out later that they'd adjusted something else to try to compensate for our problem and that was making the engine work harder than necessary ... all this crap instead of actually finding and FIXING what's broken. Bill doesn't proactively half-ass anything and call it done. He'd only concede to that method if he talked to you about it first and you understood and insisted on the half-ass approach (not me).  The final price is always fair and he's generous about throwing in helpful this & that. He drives a Subaru-powered Syncro Vanagon (4WD) that he continually tries out mods on, which helps him advise what will work, versus what won't work, and advise about the value of upgrades. He'll never recommend the priciest option, but he'll give me info on the full gamut of what's available ("you could go this route, which has these features & benefits at the highest price, or the middle-priced option which has these features & benefits, or the cheaper option with these features & benefits, or the cheapest option which will fix your situation but not offer you any improvements.")   For example, we recently decided to buy a new muffler that would allow the engine to breathe way better than an OEM muffler would, but we didn't spring for stainless steel since we're in AZ and don't worry about rust. And we didn't buy the $1600 exhaust system because well, wow, that's expensive for just a smidge more power and a smidge better gas mileage. He's quick to point out where you'd experience diminishing returns for your money spent, and will only lead you toward solutions that will give you the best value for the money. This is where I think the "Affordable" plays a role in "Affordable German." This trait is a big asset because on these old vans it'd be so easy to drop $40k into them (and some people do, but not everyone wants to).  He's also pragmatic. He doesn't have that attitude that old VW owners should suffer while in their cars as part of the experience. He understands that it makes practical SENSE to have air conditioning in Phoenix, and to have more power to get somewhere faster. When we're ready to go nuts on the van, he'll be around to do a Subaru conversion. I know from experience that he's there to help me afterwards, not just collect my money for a sub-par, partial solution and get me out of his hair. He calls to check up on me, and other customers I've met mentioned that he calls them too after jobs to see how things are going. Have you ever had your mechanic call you a week or two later to see how your car is driving now? Dude, I haven't even had a doctor call me later to see how I'm doing after an appointment!  I'd recommend him to anyone. He's worth the drive on the nasty-ass I-17 out to South Phoenix. And the people who work in his shop are all awesome mechanics. They're all conversational, involved folks who give a shit. They all will explain and show you in detail what they did and discuss the process and why. They even tolerated my husband hanging around for a few hours looking at their work over their shoulders out of curiosity about the process. Big thumbs-up to them all!

1. The honey latte here is the most badass mofo of a morning drink. The last sips are the honeyest.  2. If you eat bacon like I occasionally do, bear in mind it's really fatty at Lux. I'm not into that sort of thing, because I prefer a bacon bits texture, only hot. So I have to ask for them to make it extra crispy. When they comply, it works, but I do still visualize clogging arteries. I consider what cholesterol looks like, and fatty liver disease in non-alcoholics, and all the other things I research on the internet because I consume information even more voraciously than food. I also think about how pigs are as intelligent as dogs so then I engage in some mental self-flaggelation and ultimately proceed anyway and just promise I won't do this very often and that I'm going to go vegetarian for another 5 years to fix things.  3. There's a scene in Lena Dunham's Tiny Furniture movie where her crummy old high school friend, the one with the British accent played by Jemima Kirk, whose character is a questionable ex-heroin addict who's so self centered and unhelpful that she's seemingly bent on keeping Lena Dunham down is trashed in her mom's house in the bathroom with her while Lena Dunham's little sister is having a totally-not-allowed party in their NY flat while their mom is out of town. While Lena Dunham's character is totally worried about what to do regarding the high school kids party going on in the house, her British friend is like, "Yeah, they're really being bad. Do you want something to eat? Listen, I want something to eat. Let's go into the kitchen. Let's scrum into the kitchen and get a crust of bread or cheese."  When I heard that line, I thought it was so odd and it really stuck with me. I mean, why would anyone have a craving for a CRUST of bread?  Then I went and ordered the baked eggs at Lux and it came with sliced thick pieces of french bread on the side with huge crunchy crusts that are totally amazeballs, and especially so when you're basically done with the baked eggs, but see that there's actually still some baked eggs left, stuck to the sides of the big mug that they bake them in, and so you use the crust of bread to clean out the inside of the mug, which is so much more effective a utensil than a pathetic fork, plus it's an edible utensil, and then you learn how completely right on that British ex-heroin addict friend of Lena Dunham's was.  Even friends who are mostly totally wrong are totally right about some things.

In the movie "The 40-Year Old Virgin," there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: "You're putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that's your problem!"  Matt's Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked "What's the probable wait time?" We were told, "Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times." The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table.   Then this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said "Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now."  I just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.  I'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the "traditional breakfast food" so "different."  I ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.  The omelette was more like "Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese." The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?  I'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to "go there" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?  It was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely "real," which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats "Moons Over My Hammy" for instance.  But we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.  The bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said "That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there," while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.  Mostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department.   I might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.  The "thick-cut bacon" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it's hard to do bad.  I see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950's signs that say "Eggs!" and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it's better than Denny's, and it's better than 5 & Diner. It's NOT "The Best" and it's most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.  The chalkboard on the wall inside says "Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner." I hadn't known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it's worth the wait.  I'm glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog.

My family and I have been eating at Sierra Bonita since they first opened. They keep getting better. One primary differentiator I can point out about this place is that they do not skimp on the veggies. A lot of the time, eating out means carbs with a side-o-carbs, featuring one protein ingredient and maybe some cheese. They don't just do vegetables as an afterthought, they use delicious and unusual ones. Their mix has green and purple romanesco, rainbow carrots, broccoli, squash, green beans, spinach and usually sauteed with butter and rosemary. Sometimes choyote is in the mix too - at brunch, order Cowboy Hash. And then all too often, at other places beans are "just beans" and don't have much flavor (or my least favorite, are honey-like and sugary). Sierra Bonita's beans are totally rich and flavorful, they're whole beans, not refried and are super savory, elevated far above the ordinary "side of beans." They have a Moscow Mule that comes in a copper cup and tastes super refreshing in the summertime (plus you can rest the cup on the inside of your wrists to cool down from your drive there). I love their Southwestern Cobb salad for lunch. Their Carne Asada is super filling, even the half-size. Same goes for the Buttermilk Chicken, and it's nice to get mashed sweet potatoes instead of just mashed potatoes. Lots of good, rich flavors and intensity here. They have a new dinner appetizer, butter-braised mushrooms. OMG these are to die for. There's gorgonzola cheese in there, and maybe a little bit of heaven. I've had the Albondigas soup, the green chile posole and the Azteca soup and they're all rich and deliciously filling.  Then the most out-there sounding dinner entree: chocolate and espresso-rubbed pork tenderloin. It says all this but the taste that pops out the most is the vanilla. It's like Holy Crap, how did anyone think this up and how does it actually work so well? Gah ... I just ate there for dinner and writing all this makes me hungry all over again. They just added salmon tacos to their menu. Totally heart-healthy, what a good excuse to go. Super juicy and delicious.  Everyone who works there is nice and relaxed and a lot of them have been there for years. Happy hour is fun. There are always people from the neighborhood there and their jalapeno poppers are super delicious - not fried with ranch dressing like a pub would have. Their jalapenos are sliced and filled with seriously flavorful cheese and served on a skillet with a tomato wedge sizzling in between each pepper. I could go on, but if you do a ctrl-f search on my review for the word "super" you'll find a word count that's high enough to show what I think of this place.
