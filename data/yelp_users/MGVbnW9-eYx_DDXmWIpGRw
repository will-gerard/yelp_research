I've dined here a million times and as a rule, I'd give this place a 5 start rating but today, the wrecking ball is being put into place to bring this place right down to the parking lot.  Let me explain ......  The food?   Outstanding !!  The service ......  Outstanding (Our server Brian rocked it)  The actual restaurant ambiance ......  Very cool  So what's the problem?  I had two (2) business friends with me (party of 3) and at the end of the night, dropped about $600 which included a nice tip.  Then I went to leave and asked them to validate my parking. "No problem sir, I'll be right back"  They use a token coin thingy that had to be changed and that was okay.  I went to leave and the token didn't work and the parking dude said I still had to pay ....  Count to 10 before you vaporize this guy.  I convinced him that after dropping $600 for drinks and food, I had no intention of paying a dime for parking.  We argued some more and the parking dude made it clear he didn't like my attitude.  Tough, get used to it.  So over being required to pay for parking, I've banned this place for all lunches and dinners.  They clearly have too much business so I think we all need to help them with an attitude adjustment.  Thanks for reading  After my review:  I received the following message from the restaurant:   Justin S.     Comment from Justin S. of The Capital Grille    Business Manager   3/26/2016 *  Doug, this is certainly not the way we would have envisioned your visit concluding and I offer you our sincerest apologies for the trouble you had retrieving your vehicle. We do appreciate you as our guest and are eager to demonstrate that. When you have a moment, I hope you will take a moment to contact me.  Best,  Justin Scruton  I'm always glad to have a business respond to a negative review .....  Shows that they care and I appreciate that very much.  It was nice but not enough to change my position and stance on going back.  Nope their out of my "LBRB"  (Little black restaurant book)  Thanks for reading

I hope I have the right store as I do not want to knock the wrong one but I'll carry on anyway.  Yelp removed my previous review as they thought I was too harsh and lacked enough detail.  I'll start over.  The worst pizza I've ever had in my life.  That's pretty detailed.  Why?  I ordered the pizza on line and they were literally knocking on my door 20  to 30 minutes later.  Can you prepare, fully cook and deliver a pizza in 20 to 30 minutes?  I don't think so. That's pretty detailed.  The center of the pizza was literally uncooked, raw dough ....  That's pretty detailed.  I was hungry so I fire up the oven to 425 degrees F (That's pretty detailed too) and attempted to finish cooking it.  I called the store and asked for "A manager type" of person and got a very nice young lady that I doubt was 20 years old (I'm guessing but that pretty detailed) and told her what I had received. Her response was "sorry" as if that solved the problem.  That was more detail.  I threw the pizza in the garbage and went out for dinner so in my detailed opinion, Papa Johns pizza is the absolute worst piece of crap on the planet and I'll never, ever try them again.  Was that detailed enough for Yelp??  Thanks for reading

What a piece of crap air port!!!  It's near midnight and we have a 1:30 am flight to miami, I know .... bummer. Anyway, we need to get to the B gates but the B gate security gates are closed. No problem, walk 20 minutes back through the A gates and loop back around.  Restaurants or open bars?  Nope not one.  There was 1 vending machine that couldn't or wouldn't take a credit card.  So much for a bottle of water.  This place SUCKS!!!!!

Having recently moved, I needed a company to come in and set up all of my home theater items, audio, visual with wall mounted TV's.  iWired was recommended by my builder so I gave them a call. An appointment was made and they came by the house to better understand our needs.  They made a couple of recommendations (that we accepted) and set up a second appointment for the actual installation. Erik T. was our technician and arrived on time, with a smile on his face. He went to work and in no time at all, a clean and professional application was completed.  I couldn't be happier and am already planning another call to iWired to wall mount 2 additional TV's in the house.  Give these guys a go ......  I think you'll be pleased.  Thanks for reading.

These guys absolutely rock!!  I have Pella brand doors and windows throughout my home and I wanted all the glass sliders checked to make sure everything was in good order.  My tech checked out all the doors and found a single problem which he repaired in a snap.  Total repair bill was about $150 and I couldn't be happier.  Great attitude and great service.  I'd recommend them in a heartbeat.  Thanks for reading

With her Royal Highness in tow we stopped in for lunch as my darling once again, got sucked into a "local dines" coupon .....  Bit I digress.  The place was pretty busy and I noted that they had one and only one waitress that was very nice, but very, very swamped.  Her highness had some sort of veggie, gluten free pizza that made me want to gag but unlike her majesty, I eat pizza that tastes good as opposed to pizza that good for me.  I had their Italian meat sandwich which was actually pretty good.  I think the key to success was the lack of bun, or bread .....  Don't you just hate a sandwich or sub where's there's 4 oz. of meat and 2 pounds of bread ??   The food quality was right in the middle, neither good nor bad and the wait staff was cheerful. The menu was pretty complete and included lobster Rav which in retrospect, I wished I had ordered.  An OK place but from our part of town, just way to far to go .....

Took a customer to lunch today at the tempe store and had a great experience!  We sat at the bar and we're well taken care of by  the bar tender ...... Nuts, I did not get his name.  2 great lunches and 6 adult bevies and out the door for $98.00 which included a 20% tip.  This joint has always been good.  If you've not tried them, give em a try and I'll bet you'll be pleased.

I played this track a million years ago prior to its current name and for whatever reason, decided to give it a try.  As a recall, this course was pretty with tons of elevation changes so what the hell .....  Let's go.  We arrived (give yourself plenty of time) and the first problem was finding the bag drop but after calling the pro shop, back tracked and sure enough, there it was.  Got signed in and headed to the practice facility and was surprised to find that they charge for warm up balls. With the fees they charge, warm up balls should be free. The practice facility is small, very small.  We headed out and were disappointed that the course was cart path only ..... That should have been brought to my attention when I booked the tee time, but again, it's that magic time of year so shut up and let's tee it up.  The course really is awesome with million dollar views and with a monster influx of money, could be a true diamond in the rough but whoever owns this course, appears to be operating on the cheap.  The greens were akin to putting on carpet, and I mean 70's shag carpet .....  Furry and slow!  The tee boxes looked like they were built with tinker toys and even the tee markers needed to be painted.  I was struck by the fact that you'd be looking down hill (or up hill) and have a beautiful view and then if you looked off to the right or left, you see grounds that looked like a 4 wheel drive club just had an event ....  Too bad.  The carts were also circa 1950.  GPS on board?  Nope .....  Dirty? .....  Yep .....  Towels to wipe your hand or face?  Nope ..........  The guys in the pro shop were less than friendly, almost curt but maybe they were having a bad day .....  Hey, it happens but hang on, here comes the beverage cart !!!!   Oh crap, no hard liquor .....  I hope you want a beer because there will be no mimosa's or bloody Mary's for you.  Tip .....  Bring a flask or two or three and get a cup with ice and a mixer.  Cheaper anyway.  For the cost, the conditions, the location and the lack of amenities we will take our golf dollars elsewhere.  Last comment, do stop for lunch at the resort restaurant.  Good burgers, nice people and they serve adult bevies .....  Thanks for reading.

Combine bad service and awful food and bingo ... You've got Harold's. With about a billion restaurants to pick from, why would anyone eat at this dump and based upon the dining area and it's level of filth, ya gotta wonder what the kitchen looks like.

The fact of the matter is that I can't figure out how this place stays open.  We met several friends on Sunday, to catch a couple of games and generally speaking, it's a pretty good sports bar  In no time at all, virtually every chair in the place was taken which ought to be a good thing right?  However, waiting 20 minutes for a drink or 20 minutes to put in a food order is the kiss of death in my book.  They were so under staffed that our waitress said she was ready to walk out.  This has happened the last 6 times we were in there ...  Bad service combined with normal or average food.  Won't be going back ....  Don't knows who manages this place but firing that person would be a good start.

Played this track yesterday, sort of on a whim as I used to play it all the time but Lordy, that was 20 years ago .........  This course is about 2 clicks away from being a world class golf club but I'm sorry to say that the short comings are so dramatic, that only an enormous infusion of cash and care could turn this sinking sink back into the wind.  Let's start about what's right about this place.  The views from almost every hole are simply fantastic and almost worth suffering through your round to see.  What else is good ................  Ah, nothing.  If your not familiar with the Cave Creek/Carefree area this course can be a challenge to find, but once you do find it, locating the bag drop is just about as difficult. I actually had to call the pro shop to ask where it was.  Once in the pro shop, I found the staff to be way less than friendly, almost curt and I found that odd as most golfers are pretty friendly.  The practice area (they do charge for your warm up balls) is very small with maybe a dozen slots or positions and pretty narrow but I guess it's OK as what happens on the course is all that matters right?  I've got to talk about the carts which I'm pretty sure they purchased in 1950 and never replaced. On board GPS ??  Nope.  Our brake lock wouldn't work and as this course is extremely hilly, just parking the cart became a real issue .....  "Park over there, it's kinda of flat"  We laughed our butts off when we noticed that our cart had a built in ash tray right in the dash ......  What a scream!.  Towels in the cart ???  Nope. So when you get sweaty, just wipe your face on your shirt sleeve.  But's let's stop complaining and move onto the course.  As mentioned, the views from almost every hole make playing this course worth it.  There are tons of elevation changes and I mean tons.  Most holes played way up hill or way down hill and none of them were especially hard to score on.  What was an issue is that they just over seeded and it was cart path only.  I wish they had told us that when the reservation was made.  Oh well ......  The fairways were OK but the greens can only be described as furry ......  Long, long grass that made putting something akin to practicing on carpet ......  Shag carpet.  The traps were as mess as well.  Early on the front side, I found myself in a trap that must of had a water depth of 24" ........  Poor drainage to say the least.  What they need to do ...............  Invest, invest, invest and invest.  What I found weird was desert waste areas next to a beautiful hole that appeared to have been scraped off with a road grader and left empty.  Tee boxes with makers so old, it was  hard to see what color you were on.  Class it up boys.  This course could be a true diamond if someone with a good eye and a budget took it over but I don't think that's the case and that's a real shame because this course screams of potential and greatness.  From a cost standpoint, this track is way over priced and I can't imagine what the rates will be during the winter season but as I have no desire to go back, I won't have to worry too much.  Thanks for reading.

The area we live in is on a mountain and is famous for scorpions as well as all the other standard desert critters.  We use this firm on a once a month basis as any service less than that just doesn't seem to keep the creepy crawly's at  bay.  I've used these folks for more than 15 years and find them friendly and professional and in my experience, they do a great job.  From a cost stand point, they are quite fair and I'd recommend that you give them a try.

We have used this company for the past 5 years or so and used them again yesterday. Had to stop and say that they are absolutely fantastic!  They show up on time, their employees are clean and friendly and their rates just can't be beat.  I'm sure you will be as happy as we are so thanks to Sue and all the other staff members at Carefree Clarity.

First off .... if you've heard the rumors that the donkey is closing, please note that it's not true!!!!!  They are alive and well.  Let's get down to business.  One of the very best happy hour joints in the entire valley with an outstanding staff, combined with aoutstanding menu.  The Cantina shooters ($5 happy hour) are sick and are so good, they need to be outlawed.  The $5 happy hour chips and salsa is close to a meal by itself and it comes with 3 different salsa's.  Delisssssh!   The beer and wine offering may not be the biggest in the valley but believe me, it's more than adequate.   This is not a sports bar but they do have one tv at the bar ..... hurry as seating is limited.  Give this place a try and I'm betting you won't be disappointed.  Thanks for reading ....

Stopped in for lunch today and tried the Hawaii burger and regular fries. A very good burger and my waiter (Andy) did a great job. Complaints?   The music is a bit too loud for my taste. 2 adult bevies and I'm out at $58 clams which includes a tip.  PS..... I'm not a beer dude but they have 118 beers on tap!  If you're in the Desert Ridge area, give them a go.  Thanks for reading .......

Her Royal Highness and I decided to stop in for a bite to eat after watching the new "Jurassic World" movie in 3D (Great movie BTW) and for the first time ever, I'm giving this place a complete thumbs down review.  Sheeeeesh!  Clearly all the wait staff got up that morning and took one (1) angry pill and one (1) stupid pill.  I've been in this joint a million times and I'm now wondering if I will ever go back. Yeah, OK ......  They were sort of busy but there's no excuse for bad service, served up by angry waiters. We ran up a pretty large tab and for the first time in ages, I felt that it was completely OK to stiff them on the tip ......  I left them nothing which is exactly what they deserved.  Sorry, but once again I have to say "Ho Hum food with knock out service is OK but Ho Hum food and awful service is the kiss of death"  Too many other restaurants to go to.  Thanks for reading.

I stumbled around trying to find a firm that could repair and restore our beautiful west facing (yes, west facing) wood doors and after some work, discovered Desert Rose Door and man was I lucky!!  If your like me, you just don't use or look at your front door that much and when it was brought to my attention that my doors looked like they had been hit by a bomb, I flipped.  Rose at Desert Rose was awesome to work with and in no time, she had a professional crew of three (3) guys  removing the front door and at the end of the day, the work was complete and the door and sides looked brand new.  I was very, very happy and will use them again ......  Thanks for reading.

So if you've followed me at all, you would know that I'm a big pizza guy ..... So last night her Highness and I got back into town a bit late and didn't want to stop to eat or attempt to cook at the house so we made the monster mistake of ordering a couple of pies from Barro's for a home delivery.  That was my first mistake.  Granted, there was a Sunday night NFL game on and I suppose that might be the reason it took 3 hours for the delivery and I also suppose that because dumb and dumber was out driving around all night, that the pizza's showed up cold and floppy but what I do know is that I've learned a valuable lesson in placing an order for take out or delivery dog food ....  And that won't happen again.  Barro's is the worst and you'd be well advised to take them off your list.  I'd give them no stars but apparently, that's not an option.

Anyway, Marty and the Screen Mobile came to the house, On time mind you and did a wonderful job.  They were in very quickly, the quality was great and the price was very fair.  I'll use them again and I think you should as well.  Thanks for reading

Stopped in for a  super bowl  breakfast.  Maybe  the worst decision of 2015.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and  clearly, these folks have never been to the south.    I had one bite and sent it back.  my dog wouldn't eat this crap   Run for your life.   Avoid this slop house. .  Yuk  After this last review, I received the following hate mail from my server:  Subject: Why you gotta be so mean?    "Hi, Doug, I was your bartender both times you came into 92nd Street Café.  I must say that I am extremely offended by your unwarranted, hateful comments.  You have ordered TWO items on our menu, obviously they didn't appeal to YOU, but was it necessary to call the place, and I quote, a "slop house"?  I offered to do anything to make the experience better for you, but you would have none of it.  You didn't want to be happy, you wanted to be mean and insulting.  I tried.  Funny that you couldn't find it in your review to mention that Stephanie enjoyed her pancakes or that I provided good service.  Instead you used an all over generality to condemn the entire place over two dishes.  FYI, 8 orders of biscuits and gravy served at the bar, only complaint was yours.  Bad mood? Likely.  I hope Stephanie returns.  She was a really nice person.  Sincerely,  Kelly Sheppard"   I stand behind my second review 110% and what I find funny is that Kelly apparently did not take the time to read my first review which was very complimentary and for the record, she never offered anything to "make it better" .... If I go to a restaurant two (2) times and get bad food or bad service, I write them off.  Once again, there are 10 billion restaurants to go to, why would I go to a place with food that in my opinion is sub standard??

I eat at this place on a very regular basis and I've always been pleased with the quality of the food and the quality of the staff ...... until tonight.  I ordered a large 5 meat pie to go and when I arrived home and opened it, the pie had NO cheese on it.  All the toppings were off the pie rolling around in the box.  No cheese? Isn't that against some sort of cosmic law in the pizza universe?   I was starving so I took a couple of bites of the crust, which reminded me of pita bread and promptly threw a $30.00 pie in the trash.  Very, very disappointing

So here we go again....  Eating (and loving) raw fish!  This place is hopping pretty much all the time and the draw has to be the outstanding menu.  Try the "Hot Lips" and I think you'll be very happy. All the standard rolls are great too and even a sushi novice will find something they will be happy with!

Being a Sushi freak I'm always a bit worried to try new places but friends raved about Pure so my Queen and I decided to give them a test drive.  We were very pleased with the quality of the product and the staff was a pleasure as well!  Maybe a tad spendy but the overall experience was super and we will most certainly be back !

I'm really troubled about this review!  My darling and I decided to give it a go in lieu of "The Thirsty Lion" as I had not been there before.  The place was not real busy and we sat at the bar in order to watcha bit of NFL action and were immediately greeted by our bar tender/waiter staff and he was great.  Really great !  We ordered a couple of adult beverages and started to review their menu which is extensive to say the least. They also have a separate shushi menu and you know I'm checking that out. So we ended up trying a couple of shushi rolls and ordered a couple more drinks.  The rolls came along pretty quick and folks, they were off the hook good.  I was surprised.  We order one more roll and one entree and again, the food quality was great, and the service was fast and friendly.  Then the kiss of death jumped up a bit this place in the arse ....  I excused myself to use the restroom and upon entering, thought I had stepped back in time.....  And not a good time.  The restroom was filthy and not just dirty but that "Oh my God" kinda of filthy!  We finished and the check with a tip was very fair and reasonable so what am I supposed to say?  I like the place ....  The food was great as was the service ..... The cost factor was good ........... But I have to wonder what the kitchen looks like if a public area is that dirty??  I will give it one more try to try and be fair and determine if this was a fluke but as of today, this is "strike one"

This is a hard one because I actually like this place but every time I go there, I leave wondering why I keep coming back.  This is a sea food joint with a great menu. In fact, the menu might be almost too much.  The food is great as is the parking and the only store issue is the noise levels.  Pretty loud so speak up!  I had the crawfish etouffee  and if you're not familiar with it, it's white rice (about .50 worth) next to a delicious gumbo base (another .50) that contains the actual crawfish ($4 bucks maybe) and from a taste standpoint, it's wonderful.  What's the problem?  Our waitress was a tad salty, we had to ask for a side salad twice, and the over all price.  The crawfish etouffee I described above was $23.95 plus tax and tip.  Way, way, way, way (did I say that enough?) overpriced.  Thanks for reading

Sorry ... Maybe my expectations were too high as many folks had told me how great this place was and specifically how great the BBQ was! In fact the BBQ spare ribs may have been the worst I've ever endured and even that might have been given a slight pass had the wait staff been even remotely nice or friendly .... But that was not the case either so we had an awful meal, served by a staff that even a mother couldn't love and for this cowboy, I'll not be back ... Ever!

I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ, decided to give them another go .....  I was right the first time!  As before, the food was ho-hum at best, the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again, their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service?  We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (That's odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us.  To top it all off, they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food, crummy service and high heat!!!  For me, this place is officially off the books and we sure won't be back. Lesson # 1: "Your in the service industry, try and acy like it"  As a BBQ fan, I'll try elsewhere ...............

All I can say is that the stars and planets must have been out of alignment as I can't believe the trouble we had last night!  Her Royal Highness and I took in a movie and decided to try this normally excellent spot and left very, very, very disappointed.  We sat down, waited forever to be greeted, waited even longer to order bevvies, waited some more to order, had to beg for a second drink, had to ask for water THREE times, and when the food came out, we got three orders but not the forth.  Ten minutes later, the manager came and advised that the kitchen had goofed up and they had just now put the order in .....  Let's wait some more .....  That meal came and was so under cooked, her Highness couldn't eat it.  And what was funny is the fact that they weren't half full so being super busy can't be an excuse.  In defense of the restaurant, they did take the late meal off the bill and they did apologize.  The quality of the food (when we finally got it) was OK, not great and not bad, just OK and I thought they were a bit over priced.  This normally great joint just slid down the list and hit my "bottom 50" group.

A regular stopping place for me ....  The desert Ridge location.  Standard Kona menu with service that sort of comes and goes but across the board, a pretty fun place to stop.  One short bitch has to be that on my last visit, I ordered the pan fried dumplings and asked that they be over fried and as crispy as possible but when they came out they were as limp as a noodle, no pun intended.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure that was a one time goof and will certainly go back.  Thanks for reading

It's not a corporate environment. It's a locals joint and you either get it or you don't. I had lobster ravioli in a wonderful tomatoe base, warm bread a a couple of adult bevies.  Service was somewhere between awesome and great as was the quality of the food.   Maybe what I like the most is sitting at the bar and talking to other scottsdale locals.  Fun  The prices are high, no doubt but I don't come here looking to eat on the cheap.   Lob ravioli plus bread plus drinks .....  $51.00

My daughter and son in law wanted to give this joint a try and as I personally believe that pizza is one of the 5 basic food groups, I immeiately declared that I was all in.  I don't want to over pump this place but after going there 2 or 3 times, I was forced to call "911" because the food was so good, I lost my mind and needed help getting it back.  Super ambiance, great service and the food ....  Oh the food !!  Make this a must go experience, you won't be disappointed!

Stopped in tonight as there's no food at the house and it's right on my way home. I have mixed feelings about this joint as they claim their burgers are "Lush" burgers ...... Not so much but, I tried the seared ahi tuna tonight and was shocked!  It was as good as any shushi place in town.  No I'm not kidding. The service was friendly and prompt and my only serious complaint is that the restaurant was way to hot!  Turn on that AC. Give them a try .....  BTW, her royal highness left me and I'm suffering from a broken heart

Stopped in last night as it's on the way to Casa Doug and tried something new that I thought you might like ......  The Chinese Chicken Salad was Ka'Razy good!  Good portion size, wonderful warm pretzel bread and awesome taste!  The salad and one adult bevie ......  Out the door for $32.67 and that included a $10 tip!  Hats off to my waiter Marley who (as usual) was friendly and did a great job.  Thanks for reading .......

Stopped in tonight as it beats cooking at home.  Kind of a pain in the ass to find and with all the arts things that are going on, a pain in the ass parking  Tonight parking was a breeze.   Golf on TV (ya baby ) and a wonderful vodka in my hand.  If your a pig like me, try the sloppy Joe (reminds me of my youth) you'll enjoy the sloppy Joe.  Loved the sweet potato fries.  Had Allegra joined me, the night would have been  perfect   Try this joint  Thanks for reading

Stopped in this afternoon for lunch and had another knock out experience ......  More or less.  The menu is pretty good for lunch and the atmosphere is very relaxed, almost to a fault, more on that later.  I ordered the "Steak N" Bleu" salad and was very pleased.  The portion was very large and the salad was very tasty because of the cranberries, the sugared walnuts and  of course, the bleu cheese crumbles.  The steak itself was probably around 4 Oz. and the quality of the meat was good. As a rule, steak on a salad falls in somewhere between donkey butt and/or old German shepherd but not here .......  Tasty and tender with just enough seasoning to wrap it all up.  Price??  $16.00  What I didn't like:  My waitress was about the nicest girl I've ever met and I did tip her 20% but the place was slow (9 people in the entire place) and I thought she spent way to much time talking to the other employees.  It's not like she ignored me but twice, I had to more or less wave at her to get her attention.  The are on Bethany Home Road, right off the 51 and you should give them a try as I think you'll be pleased.  Thanks for reading

If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.  Sorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.

Stopped in this AM for breakfast and all I can say is WOW !!!!!  My server (Liza) rocked me with great service and a wonderful smile but get this, she asked if I had tried their breakfast quesadilla and as I had not, thought I'd give it a try.  Off the hook Deeeeelish (I love chorizo) and large enough that I couldn't eat it all.  Breakfast, coffee and two (2) mimosa's .......  $19.36 plus a tip.  What a great deal on some truly good food and get this, on the weekend, this breakfast comes with unlimited mimosa's ......  Can you say Uber??  Looking forward to going back.  Give em' a go, I think you'll be very pleased.

Stopped in to one of my favorite breakfast spots and had a craving for a nice plain ham and eggs meal ......  Complete with sweet potato tots, coffee and a mimosa. My server suggested I try it in a wrap ........  A tomato/basil flour tortilla and so they smashed 2 scrambled eggs, about a pound of ham and the sweet potato tots in the wrap.  Crazy delissssssh and I couldn't finish the entire portion.  If you've not tried Tryst, you're missing great dining opportunity.  Give em' a go, I think you'll be pleased ......  Oh yeah, their patio is dog friendly so be sure to bring Sir Mutely with you.  Thanks for reading .....

I'm very disappointed.   I've been sitting at the bar for 10 minutes and I've yet to be greeted. They have a high top with 6 guests and another with 8. They have 9 other total guests managed by a wait staff of 3.  The food here is actually pretty good but I'm completely underwhelmed by the service  Ok, my pizza arrived and I've done my best.  Way way under cooked.  Yuk. Raw pizza is a bad thing.  Stand by for a cost/ price evaluation

So anyway, I walk into the laundry room and there's water coming down through a drywall ceiling. Nuts.  I needed help today and the very 1st plumber I called was booked up but suggested I give these guys a call.    For starters, their phone people were off the hook professional and very, very nice. They advised that they could have someone out between noon and 2 PM and sure enough, their guy showed up on time.  He found and repaired the issue in less than 2 hours and the total bill was under $125.00  When their tech left, he gave me a business card and for once, I actually kept it for future use although, if luck is with me, I won't need a plumber for a long, long time.  I would recommend them.

This is a fairly new to the valley, "Fast food" type of place with both drive through with a dine in area as well.  I've been to every "specialty burger" joint in the valley and none of them, and I mean NONE of them, can hold a candle to the food quality of Culiver's!  If you do fast food, and quality is what your after then you must give these guys a go!!  Awesome food, a very unique menu and very friendly staff members.  I give it 5 starts and 3 thumbs up!

Went there only because a customer asked if we could .....  the customer is always right,  right?  Well there was nothing right about the food.  I ordered the pastrami sandwich, served rueben style (add saurcraute and dressing) and what a train wreck.   The bread was either (pick one) so stale it was crunchy or so over toasted it was crunchy.  Who toasts the bread on a sandwich like this anyway?  The meat was skimpy and I couldn't locate the dressing anywhere on the sandwich.  One guest has what was referred to as Flatbread pizza and Franky speaking, it so so limp, he almost had to eat it with a fork.  Our other guy had a salad that he called "ok I guess"  I get it that most of us guys are there to ogle at the boobies but let's not forget it's still a restaurant and when it comes to forgetable, this joint has all the qualifications.   Run for your life

I believe the food can be described in 2 simple words .......  "Dee Lissssh"  Pasta so good it's probably outlawed in several states but let's just move on OK?  The service was off the hook ... Friendly, and prompt but not over bearing.  The food from the sea bass to the pasta was crazy good and if you are a pizza freak like I am, I can assure you, you will not be disappointed.  Be it pizza by the slice or the whole pie, you will be pleased.  Prices were about right as my darling and I each had 4 adult beverages and we split 3 entrees (Hey ... Watch the fat jokes, I'm just big boned and we did take one home for later) which came with salads etc. ....  Total cost before a tip ; $91.00  I'm going back and I hope you will too !

Lord please help me.  Her Royal Highness asked me to take her to din din and I picked Cibo .  They recently remodeled the restaurant and we wanted to check it out  The new bar rocks ...... the out side patio is awesome. ....... they pushed the kitchen back and  the general floor plan is great!!  So why won't I return to one of my formally favorite joints?  Got there at 5:30 PM and the place was basically empty.  So far so good.  The crowds arrived and that's when the wheels fell off.  One bar tender (her second night behind the bar) Amber, was supposed to handle all the bar service plus the patio    Result?  Beg for service   Food?  Zzzzzzzzzzz .   Boring, and no taste.  Bad service combined with bad Food?   Put a gun to the head of Cibo and let's just call it a day.  Move on to a better joint.

Took her royal highness to the Tap Haus as she wanted to try something new. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and meals as well.  We both thought the food was OK (You need to like German style food or just move along) as was the service and the drinks.  What struck me the most was that the food is severely over priced whereas adult beverages were just as much under priced.  I think this is a great building, with good parking (dirt lot ladies so be ready to dust off your heels) but I'm convinced this building is cursed and whomever moves in, is destined to go belly up.  Tons of seating but the place never seems to be busy.  Tons of large screen TV's but still not so much a sport's bar.  I think the wait staff could use some pointers as they seem a bit confused and less than welcoming .......... Tons of beers to pick from but people around us said the beer was cool but not cold.  Warm beer??  Maybe over seas but not in the USA.  I think we'll go back ...... I think .......... Or maybe not ........  Not loving it, not hating it, give it a try and see for yourself.

Let's just say that it's a pretty cool place that based on service won't be open long. We stopped in for MNF and had to beg to be served! Then they took the meal order for my girl friend, but didn't take mine. One meal came out and they finally put 2 and 2 together and figured out what happened.  Next, we had to actually reach over the front of the bar to get silverware. Most restaurants automatically give those to you.  Next, the ice in the drinks is so small, you have to use a straw, whether you want to or not.   Can't rate their food becasue they never asked if I wanted to order but the service was awful and I won't be back.

A ton of people I know demanded that I check this locals spot out and as the location is pretty OK, I gathered up her royal highness to check it out.  The place wasn't extremely busy as we made a point of getting in early, but it certainly filled up in a hurry a bit closer to happy hour.  First thing that hit me (rolled me over actually) was an over whelming smell of sewer gas !!!  I trust that was a one time thing so I won't pin these guys to ground just yet.  We did not dine so no comment on food.  Service was OK, neither great nor poor but I thought the pour was a bit short.  Lots of older people .... In fact, the place filled with the older set but the joint was jumping and certainly there was no dance of the living dead going on here.  Might go back, might not .....  Stayed tuned for another review.

Her highness and I stopped into the Soul Café for breakfast today and wanted to share a great experience. Here highness had a great 2 egg breakfast over veggies and GF toast. She was very, very pleased !!  I had my favorite .....  Biscuits and gravy with two (2) eggs. As good as I've ever had.  The total menu is very well balanced and perhaps the best thing about this restaurant is that EVERYTHING is made in the restaurant and is about as fresh as fresh can get!  Costs .........  Today they had a "buy one breakfast and get a second for half price" special.  Including the half off deal, we walked out for $61 which included an $11 tip.  That might seem high but we each had 2 mimosa's which was $24 of the total bill.  The staff was bright and cheery and I recommend you give them a try.

If you've read my reviews at all, you will quickly understand that for me, the restaurant business is a combination of service and product quality.  In other words, if the food quality is high enough, I'll put up with ho-hum service. Likewise, if the service is good enough, I'll deal with ho-hum product quality .... A slippery slope that every restaurant ought to be concerned with.  So we went to the "Oink Cafe" for the first time as it seems like a fun and cool place to have breakfast and we walked in right at 8 AM with 4 adults and 2 kids under the age of 5 ....  The place was for the most part empty and I immediately had a bad feeling when the hostess asked if we had a reservation.  I answered "Yes, but I'm going to eat here anyway" and that famous one liner went right over her head .... So much for my stand up routine.  Now remember, the place was pretty much empty and the hostess actually said "We have a hard time with groups as large as 6" ........  You're kidding right??  A hard time with a group of 6 and you want me to make a reso at a breakfast joint??  Strike one  Our server was pretty good and had a great smile BUT she let us all order regular black coffee and after it was on the table, mentioned that they also had a wonderful list of specialty coffee's which would have been nice to know before we ordered.  Strike two  The food quality quality wasn't over the top great nor was it awful.  Right in the middle as breakfast is more or less, hard to screw up to bad.  Cost was also more or less right in the middle so that wasn't an issue either.  What was an issue and probably the key reason I won't go back was the noise factor!  The walls and floors are all hard and after the morning crowds showed up, the noise level shot up and we had to literally shout at each other to be heard !!  Strike three  A fun place but a pure novelty that I doubt will be open in a year from now.  There are just too many competitive breakfast places that do a better job.

One of my favorite happy hour places in the Scottsdale area. The staff is always prompt and friendly without being over bearing and their menu is very solid.    Make sure you give any of their oven cooked flat breads a try as they are all fantastic

Stopped with her Royal Highness on the way out of town for brunch and walked in at exactly 10 AM .....  Which is when they open.  We sat at the back outside bar as the Arizona weather was so nice and the snow birds are slowly leaving town, thank God for that.  I would guess by the service that the wait staff walked in a 5 before 10 AM as the service was cordial but dawdling at best. I asked for coffee and was told that they had no coffee except de-calf .....  "We ran out and nobody went and picked some up"  No coffee .....  Really?   At 10 AM??  The food was OK, not great and not bad but just OK.  I stopped to use the rest room and was very unhappy to find the men's room a complete disaster with all the trash cans over flowing onto the floor ....  Apparently, the previous night had been very busy and the restaurant just didn't have time to police up the bath rooms .....   I hope they had time to clean the kitchen!!  The ambiance is nice and the background music was great ......  But at the end of the day, this place is nowhere near the top 5 (or even top 10) for breakfast or brunch places.  The prices were way too high for the quality of the product and when combined with poor service ......  Well, you know the end to that one.  I sure don't mean to pick the place apart based upon details but attention to details is what defines greatness in every business .....  Ho-hum I can get anywhere.

Her Royal Highness wanted to stop for adult bevies as she had been there before and I had not. Pretty cool vibe and generally speaking, a good atmosphere ...  The problem was the less than sterling service. I'm pretty sure that when you have to stand up and wave your arms to get the attention of the staff that seemed more interested in each other, than their customers, that you've got a serious problem.  I liked the outdoor seating but the snooty staff was enough of a turn off that I probably won't go back.

Her Royal Highness asked me to give this dump another try and how could I say no? I've been told several times that the general food isn't very good bu that their pizza was pretty good, so we thought, why not?  I was wrong.  The pizza was ho hum at best and probably wouldn't stand up against Little Caesar's $5 hot and ready pizza, which I wouldn't feed to a homeless dude.  Better yet is that this dump still hasn't figured out that they are in a service industry and that their customers need to be serviced. The ample staff twittered away their time, looked bored and as usual, we had to ask the bar tender to get us a drink.  Rule # 1, when a customer attempts to throw money at you, don't duck!!  Personally, I would recommend you skip this place (along with the 40,000 flies that were there) altogether and seek out another place to spend your money.  We won't be back!

Worst service on the planet.  Stopped in ahead of picking up a friend and sat at the bar.  I had to beg for a drink and the idiot bar tender never asked if I wanted to see a menu.  I'd love to manage this bar ...... I'd fire all the bar tenders and hire a bunch of hard runners. I'd double their revenue on day one.   What a tragedy  Post review comments ...........  After my review (which I still stand by) I was contacted by Chelsea's via E-mail and they appeared to be  sincerely concerned about my experience. They offered to refund my bill (which I declined) and in a second message, offered a gift card .... Which I also declined.  Good for them for addressing my review but if they want to continue to operate, they'd better address their awful wait staff.

If you're looking for a breakfast spot to take a nap, you'll be on heaven here.  Sleepy church or opera music mixed with a library environment and it was all I could do to not stab myself in the eye.  The food was pretty much ok as was the service but honestly, no liquor license?  What's up with that.  The lack of vibe will certainly send me to any other number of fun breakfast spots.  Thanks for reading .....

I've always been been a burger Ho' so trying their green chili burger was going to be a challenge  ....  after all, this joint ain't a burger place ......  Or is it?  The green chilli burger rocked my day with 2 patties, bacon, lettuce, fresh chills and some sort of Delisssssh sause.  Served with steak fries and a cocktail and my day is perfect!  Good service and friendly staff made it perfect!  Only drawback is the parking.  Worth the trip and I hope you'll give this place a try ...  Thanks for reading

Her Royal Highness came up with this spot and as pizza is one of the 5 key food groups, we decided to give it a go. There was only 2 other people in the place so perhaps I can't rate the service as how can you have bad service when you're the only one there?  A nice, warm atmosphere and our waitress Megan was very nice. We tried two (2) different wood fired pies and both were fantastic!  Now look, if you think Domino's or Barrow's is what pizza is supposed to taste like, then you're not going to like this place.  They had a full bar and a pretty good wine list.  We'll go back and hope you will too!

As a burger snob, I'm completely qualified to review this joint.  You order the size of your burger,  and every option to add to your burger to create an organism of taste.   The best burger I've ever had and I can't wait to go back.  2 meals, 5 adult bevies.  80 bucks out the door which included a 20 dollar tip  Can't wait to go back

Man O' Man do I feel dumb!  If you read my previous review of this place, you'd know I was their # 1 fan and today, Her Royal Highness decided to re-visit what I thought was the best burger joint in town.  Major disappointment .............  First, the strong suit of this place was your ability to "design" your own personal burger feast!.  Pick the bun, pick the size of the patty and then add what ever your sick little heart desires .....  From different cheeses, to lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, onions or what ever ............  That's now gone (sniff - sniff) and your forced to  order off the standard menu.  I thought "Well, OK, the burger will still be great"  Not so much.  I ordered the "Big Poppa" bacon cheese/BBQ burger, medium.  The flavor was flat as a pancake and the patty was extremely well done, maybe even to the point of describing it as burned!   Our server Anthony was very nice and did his best to wait on us but appeared to be a bit overwhelmed with the number of people and tables he was trying to serve.  I like (or liked) this place a ton (Read my previous review) but the drive from our home in Carefree is entirely to far to get a ho-hum burned burger ......  I will continue my never ending search for the best burger in beautiful AZ and it truly saddens me to cross this formally 5 star restaurant off the list.

The first time we stopped in, this place was barely open and the patio had not been completed and we wrote off the awful service due to the fact that they weren't really ready to open so when her Highness suggested we try them again, I said "Why not"?  So allow me to start with the fact that this "Irish Pub" is about as Irish as a pig's arse, so if you're really looking for an Irish experience, go elsewhere. The overly loud, pounding deep bass, hip hop music made it impossible to talk but what the hell, it's a bar.  The service was awful but the awful service was poorly delivered by a happy and bright, under trained staff so they do have that going for them ......  I had to wave an empty beer glass at the bar tender to get his attention, but that appeared to be OK by their standards.  We ordered a couple of burgers and were surprised that they quality and taste of the grub was pretty darn good so that's an upside right?  The bill for 2 meals and 2 drinks a piece came to about $60 bucks so I didn't think the costs were over the moon but based upon the poor service and noise factor, I won't be going back ....  Try the Skeptical Chymist for a much closer Irish pub experience

Her Royal Highness decided we'd take a friend to this spot as several neighbors said it was pretty darn good. Aaaaah not so much!  It's not that the foods bad or the service is bad because the food is neither great or awful and the service is the same, neither great or bad.  The menu is confusing and  gave me a headache trying to figure out what to order but the real problem I had was the noise level.....  Forget about having a conversation at the table, unless your prepared to twist and shout!  Our server was bright and cheery and came to our table every 45 seconds or so to see if we needed anything, which to me is not always a good thing.  I would not tell you not to go but for my time and money, there are probably better choices to be made.  Not good, not bad ... You decide

Took the kids to breakfast and was completely under whelmed. While lunch and dinner include a wait staff, breakfast is served cafeteria style. Yuk.  Order your food, wait, food comes out ..... nuts, didn't get silverware so go back in (we sat outside as apparently I hadn't ingested enough car exhaust) and nuts again as I forgot to get a drink.  They don't have a full bar so forget a breakfast bloody and the food was very forget able as well.  They employees were very nice, bright and cheerful so perhaps we will try it again for lunch or dinner.  Breakfast?  Not so much

Having driven by several times, her royal highness and I decided to stop in to check it out. A trendy joint with a pretty good menu but suffering greatly from unfriendly servers, resulting in lackluster service ........ I can't tolerate bad service!   Her highness ordered a turkey burger and declared it "one of the best she ever had" ..... a very good thing. Because of the bad service, I elected not to eat and instead sat there and pouted. .... although I did have 2 adult bevies and they  were ok.  Prices were fair but I'm not sure that we'll go back.  Major bonus?  Dogs every where  out front and being a dog lover, they saved the day.  Give them a try, maybe you'll have better luck. ;)  Review update:  We decided to give them another go and I'm glad I did. The last time we stopped in, the affair was spoiled by some not do friendly service. This time however, all the staff members were awesome. I think the food was better too so I'm revising my original not so good rating to A-OK.  Maybe on the last trip we were under a full moon ..........

Her royal highness invited me for lunch today and we gave this place a go.  I liked the interior decor and what a friendly staff!  Her highness had a salad with salmon that was truly a work of art and I had a Ceasar salad that was awesome.   I probably should have added anchovies but that's my bad.  Two  great salads for a total of $23 plus another  $48 for adult bevies for a grand total of $82 which included a tip.  Gi ve them a go ..... I think you'll  like it!

Absolutely wonderful people who were friendly, professional and on time. I packed all the personal items (clothes etc) and had them package the big stuff. We moved a 2 bedroom condo to a local self storage facility. They arrived at 8 am and we're completely unloaded by 1 pm.  Total cost of about $1,000.00  Very pleased and I'd certainly recommend them  Thanks for reading

Stopped in tonight without her royal highness to check out this new joint. Bright airy environment with a very friendly staff. A well rounded menu if you like pizza joints.  Appies ate priced from 2.29 to a high of 12.99.  They have a fair salad offering as well as a pretty good sandwich list. Their pasta offerings are very good.  The rubber meets the road for their  pizza (which I ordered) which includes a good selection of off the shelf favorites, backed up with a great "build your own" pizza page.  Prices are awesome and I hope the pie is too.  I'll  report later on the product quality. .....  Stand by!  Pizza was outstanding!   A 10" 2 topping happy hour pie for 7 bucks ...... are you kidding me?

I gotta tell you ..... I love the concept and the general format rocks.  So forget about what's good about this place  and let's talk about the elephant in the room.    Maybe the worst service I've ever seen!!! The wait staff is confused and completely unorganized   Please, I'm begging you ..... Don't make me beg for a cocktail.  The staff is "nice" enough but we were there today with a group of maybe 25 people (happy hour) and with a bit better service,  the bar tab would have doubled   I'm not going back .....  What do you think?

I'm being generous today as I don't want or mean to slam this joint too much but please .....  C'mon, your supposed to be a restaurant.  Problem # 1 ......  The bar staff was glommed onto a "friend" who must have been a local and we felt completely dissed.  We finally ordered and her Royal Highness got some sort of crazy salad (That she said was pretty good) and I got the angus burger.  My burger came with fries (no other options were offered) and they were limp, soaked in cooking oil and had clearly been under a hot lamp for a while.  The burger was actually pretty good and I was not unhappy with that.  This place seems to be a "Yard House" wanta be and even the décor struck us as similar.  Prices seemed high to us and when we walked out, we agreed that if you lived a couple of blocks away, it might be your go to place but if you had to drive anyway, there are a million better places to try.

Her Royal Highness asked that we check out this brand new Scottsdale joint and I'm glad that we did.  Our bartender (Dove) was awesome and made sure we were well taken care of.  Her highness had a very cool salad while I elected to eat animal flesh, also very, very good. We ended up with two (2) good meals, several adult bevies (go figure) and walked out spending about $100 with included a 20% tip.  In all honesty, we will probably go back because of the wait staff .....  It's better than the food but it aint bad either.

One of the newest places in the Carefree/Cave creek area and it's surely going to give every other restaurant in the area, a run for their money!!  Her Royal highness and I stopped in and had a fantastic experience to say the least.  Here highness tried the salmon and said it was one of the best she had ever had.  I on the other hand, had the Catalina salad (full) and I can say it was the best salad I've ever had. Full flavor and it had some sort of crunchy do dads in it that were awesome too.  A very wide open seating area, a great bar which is both inside the building and outside too.  Warning !!!!! ......  If you sit at the bar facing west, at sun down, make sure you bring welding glasses as the view to the exterior is blinding.  The owners (Don and Regina) and as real as they come and you'll certainly meet them.  Give this place a try .....  You'll be pleased!

An absolutely fantastic experience. I had yet another cracked windshield and as the law enforcement community is actively pulling cars over for windshield damage, I thought I'd better get busy and get mine replaced.  I started with one of the really big national chains and was disappointed to learn that with sales tax, I was looking at about $600 ......  Ouch, especially since this was an out of pocket expense.  I spoke to a real pro (Dara ....  Hope I spelled that right!) that was friendly, knowledgeable and very efficient. She even called the day after the quote to see if she could be of service and I said, "yup, lets go".  She set up an appointment for one day after the initial call (that's unheard of) and the next morning, their installer called to let me know he was on the way and in less than an hour, I had a brand new windshield in my truck,  Here's the real deal .....  My final, out the door, installed cost was $244.12 !!!!  New OEM glass, professionally installed with a lifetime warranty against leaks etc.  If your in the need of auto glass, you simply must give these good folks a go, I am very happy and I think you will too.  Thanks for reading.

One of the newest, coolest, hipest joints in Carefree (located in the Spanish Village) and this joint might be my newest favorite happy hour place in town.  Think Mexican/Caribbean beach restaurant with a   laid back friendly staff combined with a well rounded menu and many great happy hour appies.  Tonight I tried "Chrissy's red enchiladas" and they were awesome!  $13 so this dish is well priced.  One of the cool twists on this joint is fully half the menu is all Italian fare.  So if your headed out and one of your complainers says "I don't care for Mexican food" you can go and take card of them too!  Lots of outside patio dining and they can handle large groups as well.  A relaxed decor that you'll enjoy ...... Give them a go, I think you'll be pleased.

This is another "good news - bad news" reviews that I hate to offer, but as always, I want clarity, not consensus.  Stopped in last night with her Royal Highness (insisted we give it a try) along with two friends and started in the bar for a pre dinner cocktail.  Nothing but good things here!  Don't know the name of the bar tender but this dude rocked !! Friendly but not overbearing and considering it was elbow room only (On a Thursday night no less.) he fired the drinks out and they were perfect.  Let's move onto the dining experience where the wheels didn't wobble, they fell all the way off.  A delightful young lady seated us in a great dining room and then ..... Wait, wait, and wait some more. Our waitress did finally come over, delivered menu's and with great flair, began to explain how to read the menu.  Pretty sure we have that figured out but OK, she's just trying to impress us. Here's a thought, impress me with good service.  The tables are far to small for a party of four and even after we ditched the wine glasses, felt crowded to the point of discomfort.  Let's move on .....  Enjoy that first cocktail because getting a second is almost impossible but after asking a bus person to go find the waitress, we managed another round of bevies.  The menu is outstanding, well rounded, with something for everyone.  We had two (2) complaints in our group that being that the menu font was so small, and the lighting so dark, that actually reading the menu was a problem.  Oh well, it's not a library anyway so let's talk about the food.  We ordered a prime rib that was beautiful in size, color taste and texture .....  Truly a beautiful example of prime rib.  Her Highness got shrimp cocktail and the presentation was fabulous and apparently good to the pallet but then again, shrimp cocktail is pretty hard to screw up.  Another of us got two (2) lobster tails (maybe 4 oz. each?) and they seemed ok as well.  I wasn't especially hungry so I limited myself to a salad ....  Certainly OK but what the hell, a salad is another one of those things that are hard to wreck.  We ordered sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus and were warned they were "large enough to share" .....  Not even close !!  The potatoes were maybe 4 oz. and the asparagus was maybe six to eight pieces ....  Hell, that's not enough for me alone!  The four of us spent about $240.00 before a tip ....  Way to high for what we got.  I will however, probably go back to explore the menu once again but with the price point and poor service, that might be my last time back.    Don't forget that Mastro's is within walking distance and while pricey as well, I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  Preston's needs to work very hard on the customer service aspects.  Thanks for reading

Her royal highness demanded that we give this joint a try so away we went with a song in our heart and a big appetite.  This joint is what I refer to as a "50-50" restaurant meaning that half the review is good while the other half is bad and at the end of the day, you have to decide if the good was enough to put up with the bad.  For me, the answer was no ..........  We sat at the counter which had way to may chairs in place, resulting in the feeling that you were stuffed into a very small area .....  Almost too small to place your plates in.  The chairs are these retro 50's plastic thingies that were both uncomfortable and difficult to move once you were in them.  They had one bar tender that covered the immediate bar area and the  general seating in the lobby of the building and get this, he did all the specialty coffees as well as morning blood's, mimosa's and so forth.  The net result left us begging for both drinks and coffee. And the bar tender definitely copped an attitude when we asked for service.  Not good.  Another major downside was the noise !!!!!  All the walls and floors are hard, bare surfaces so no noise is reduced or absorbed into anything,  The screaming kid behind us was enough to make me want to put a fork in my eye ....... It's loud, real loud.  The food however was great! Her highness had a very nice omelet while I tried their version of biscuits and gravy. Both were truly fantastic the price was a real deal as well.  Two complete breakfasts, three mimosa's and coffee for 45.49  You should give them a try but be patient and wear hearing protection.  Thanks for reading

Call the fire department as I plan to burn this place to the ground!  We've been coming here since day one and were pleased to see so much improvement over the past few months and then just like that ....  Boom, right down the shitter they went ....  Let me explain.  With her Royal Highness in tow, along with another 3 or 4 friends, we stopped in on Sunday to get a meal, a couple of adult bevies and catch the Cardinal game ....  Go Cards.  As we had a pretty big group, we exited the bar and grabbed a table only to find that they have NO wait staff taking orders from the tables.  WTF ???  Want a drink?  Go to the bar, order it, wait for it and then carry it back to your table. We got menus but didn't order as not everyone in our party had showed up.  Twice, a couple of twits (that can't take a drink order mind you) came by and asked for the menus back because "they didn't have enough to go around" ....  Seriously, your a restaurant and you don't have enough menus????  It only gets better from here.  All our cocktails were served in cheap plastic cups because "we don't serve glass wear after about noon".  Really ....  Wine served in cheap plastic cups???  This was like a family reunion back on the farm someplace in the mid west.  Hang on, there's even more bad news.  We went to order food and found out you have to take your order to a window and place it yourself.  Again, NO table wait staff but I did and when I got to the window, some guy says :We're all fucked up back here, if you want something to eat, take your order to the bar" ......  WOW is all I can say !!  Took the order back to the bar and the bar chic took the order and placed it for us but get this, when your very ho-hum quality food is ready, they call your name out over a loud speaker and you go pick it up and carry it back to your table.  The burgers were awful, the French fries were cold and oily and the onion rings were burnt to a crisp.  My spin is that this dump must be in financial trouble.  Cut the costs of your wait staff.  Cut the costs of cleaning glass wear and serve your "food" in a plastic tray so there's no dishes to clean.  We will avoid this joint like a case of AIDS and hope that if you make the mistake of trying this dump, that you do better than we did .....  This place is forever off our "go to" local fav's.  Thanks for reading

This place can pretty much be summed up with one word .....  Boring.  The menu is pedestrian at best with ho hum burgers, salads and so forth.  I tried their version of a Rueben ($13) and frankly speaking, they need a quick trip to NYC to find out what a Rueben is supposed to taste like.  The only high note was my waitress.  A real pro, and very friendly.  I'd go else where if I were you.....  Thanks for reading

If your in the High Street area and like a bit of country mixed with a bit of Rock and Roll then this place is going to be right for you.  It's pretty new (Opened 01-2016) and I stumbled in by accident today for lunch.  A good stumble as it turns out because I was quite pleased.  The place was virtually empty at noon which I don't understand because if you go next door to Desert Ridge at lunch, you won't even be able to find a place to park and frankly speaking, there just aren't that many good places at D.R.  Back to the review .....  They have a great lunch menu and there's NOTHING on it that costs more than $10.00 so their price point is right on!!!    They do have a complete and separate lunch menu along with a night time menu and I looked at all of them and I think that if you go, you'll agree that they one of the most complete menu's in the valley.  This is a large place with ton's of seating, a separate room designed to cater to large groups, a dance floor for the live music, and they have a roped off area for bottle service if you feel in the mood to pretend to be a rock star ....  My server, Arianna was a peach and was very interested to know what I thought of the food and service and we'll get to that in a minute.  For lunch, I picked the half rack of ribs and home cut potato chips. I'm not a potato chip kind of person, but these were off the hook good!  The ribs need some work and include good news and bad news.  The bad news is that they were a bit on the dry side and I would not use tender to describe them ....  Chewy yes but not tender.  The good news on the ribs is taste.  They hand rub their ribs and the flavor was fantastic.  My server also mentioned that every single item on the menu is made right there in the store. Nothing is processed, store bought or frozen which certainly sounds like a good thing.  I'm sure that if you're out for the night looking for a country/dance spot, that you'll be a happy camper.  Give em' a go and thanks for reading
