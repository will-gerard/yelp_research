I should have listened to the horrific reviews before we went in but we were starving and by the time we were going thru them- we had already been seated.  The WORST possible service EVER. It was 7:30 On a MONday night- there were maybe 5 or 6 tables and yet it still seemed to take the waitress 12 min to bring waters. Not to mention the diet coke which she finally brought as a doctor pepper. 10 min later I get a diet coke and its flat. Ok, not her day personally but it sat on the edge of the table untouched the whole time and she didn't even acknowledge it.  Food was boring and mediocre to say the least, salad was wilted and calzone was runny and burnt.   seriously an hour and a half later she finally rolls around to check on us and bring the check, we mention the diet coke being flat and she apologized and took it away. Brings the check and the coke is on there. Ask her to please comp the soda which she says ok too, we give the card, bill comes back, the bill has now been charged WITH the soda still on. Let's not forget that she disappeared with the card and bill for an extra 8 min, yes I was counting.   All and all, someone needs to get involved- like maybe a manager or someone who knows how to run a restaurant. This is absolutely unacceptable. And the whole vibe of the place was the same so j highly doubt it was just our one waitress.

Well, yelp, you got me good on this one. I was fly expecting something super delicious based on the great reviews and 4 star ratings. Not the case. It's a cute hole In the wall place but nothing to rave about by anyways. Chips and salsa was not edible. No other way to describe it. And when your special salad of the day can't even have fresh fruits in it (the strawberries, peaches, raspberries- all going bad) that's pretty sad.  Service was good however- very friendly.

The food has gone down hill since they first opened, or my taste for decent food has gone up. I remember this play being at least edible and presentable looking, however today it was not. They are lucky they are in AZ and have blasting air conditioning and entertainment for the kids, otherwise they would have been out of business a long time ago based on their food.

Let's stop charging extra for salad, when a whole table has ordered full entrees, and ONE person orders an appetizer and you charge for a salad. And by full table I mean 5 meals were ordered!!! Grrr.

I haven't even tasted the cake and cupcakes I just bought, but after searching for two days for anything gluten and dairy free, I am so happy this place even exists!! My baby can have a cake on his birthday!!! 5 stars in my book

Love supporting small businesses and I'm so glad I found this little place to do so!  Food is delicious, I tried a little.of everything and these pastries are on point.  I enjoyed it all, even the mac and cheese!  The owner is a sweetheart as well and was there working alone on a Friday night! That's some great commitment and I will be back for sure!

Just discovered my fit foods and for a person who is trying to eat healthy and doesn't have the time to prep and cook this is the perfect place to get your food! They have food for every pallet. I have yet to try a dish that I don't like. I am addicted.
