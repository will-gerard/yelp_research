In-N-Out is my favorite place to eat. Even when they are slammed, they have the best burgers on the run you can find. 3x2, Animal style, no lettuce, no tomato, and add chiles. You will not be disappointed.

I've been eating and drinking at San Tan for years and years. Glad to say that the beers are just as amazing as always and the food never fails to disappoint. Used to go for thirsty thursday all the time, i'm still known to rekindle the bromance now and then and show up. Love this place.

Super neat coffee spot. I'd always heard great things and decided to check it out myself. A real good space with plenty of seating and free wifi!

Great place for a quick filling meal. They have lost a lot of fans recently, but the food quality is just as good.

When I visited, there was a hair in one of the fish options, and the line worker just scooped a handful of fish out instead of discarding the entire tray. Very unsanitary. Also the drain under the soda fountain smelled awful, like it had not been cleaned. The food that I did try, a bit apprehensively, was very tasty and filling, with vibrant color and bright flavors. I just wish their food handling was a bit more sanitary.
