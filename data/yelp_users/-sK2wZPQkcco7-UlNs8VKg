Best Mexican food in the valley!  The tortillas are amazing!  Don't go during lunch during the week though.  Took 50 minutes to get my order!

I have given this car wash so many chances! I have tried various locations and even tried to go first thing in the morning.  Thinking they wouldn't be busy so they would take their time and provide quality but I was wrong.  There is no difference between the basic wash and the ultimate. After the wash, I purchased armor all wipes and wiped the dash and surroundings and the wipes were filthy.  What's the point in spending $28 on a wash when you just have to redo it yourself?

I was impressed from the moment I walked in the door!  I was greeted right away and didn't have to wait long at all.  My nail technician was Amy and she was very kind, thorough and gentle.  I got a gel manicure and she was very detailed about trimming my cuticles and prepping the nails for polish.    She also took care to polish the nails efficiently.  I will defiantly be returning!

Updating from my original review....the manager contacted me, apologizing for the bad experience and asked that I come out for another car wash on them.  This time the experience was much better and my car was thoroughly cleaned.  I appreciate the good customer service! ***original post...I got the Big Kahuna wash and for such an expensive car wash I would expect added detail...but that's not what I received.  The car wasn't dried properly so there are water spots all over.  There are several areas of the car that didn't get cleaned from the drive through car portion and wasn't followed up in the external cleaning by the guy and gal workers.  There were areas on the inside that weren't wiped down.  I had to ask the workers to vacuum an area because there were still crumbs on the carpet.  There were still finger prints from the kids on the back windows.  No attention to detail which is very disappointing.  I think they need a manager out there to evaluate the car before the keys are given back to the owner.

I am not all impressed!  I purchased a groupon for (3) of their ULTIMATE car washes which is supposed to include: vacuum, clean glass, tire shine, air freshener,   clear coat protectant, triple foam wash, interior dressing, underbody wash, cream conditioner-applied to dash, doors and console; exterior dressing-applied to all plastic.  If anything, the wash that I received was nothing more than basic.  I could have done a better job going to a $3 car wash and vacuuming it myself. The pics speak for themselves. I don't even think they pulled the mats up the vacuum underneath.  The car was still filthy and dusty and there was certainly no conditioner applied to anything!!  Extremely disappointing!  This ULTIMATE wash is regularly $27.99...wow maybe they need to quality check their process as I don't think the employees know what kind of wash you are supposed to be getting.  Why is it so difficult to find a great car wash these days?
