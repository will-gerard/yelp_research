Best service at the Gilbert/Germann intersection!  We go here all the time cuz we know the food and it's always good and the service is AWESOME.  Never have any problems.  Managers always come greet you and everyone is friendly.  They probably know us by now we come there so much, but always ask if we've been there before :D  Sweet tea's always cold, food's always hot and cooked right. Go for the Early Dine and everything is way cheaper!

Wow!  I was not expecting delish vegan food from a food trailer!  OMG it was soooooo good!  I had the Vegan French Toast and the grains and fruit and everything tasted AWESOME and was all very hand made! I'm going to try to eat from this place as much as I can from now on!  If they had a restaurant nearby, I'd be there all the time!  There service was great!  They took credit which made it easier for us.  Even emailed me a receipt!  The prices are great for the quality of food as well!  I give it 2 thumbs up!

Avoid.  They just destroy your car.  Rear brakes were not even working after taking it in and told by Chase, with an extreme cocky attitude that is how it is suppose to be.  We bought the car new and know what wrong feels like.  Had to take to the Honda dealership service to redo their crap fluid flush (that left the brake lines full of air) and repair the wheel stud they felt they needed to destroy and not even show us (wheel stud was fine when we took the car to them).  Should be out of business.   Out of a bunch of money because of them. Will never be using them again!

Not the best sushi I've ever had, but good.  The Revolving sushi conveyor is pretty cool and keeps you interested.  They do have a lot of progressive types of foods that come around as well which make you want to try them and they're good.  Got the Groupon so that made it super cheap....3 of us ate for the $12 and they gave me a free green tea shake just for checking in online.  Service is decent, but could be a little better since we had to keep on our waiter about refilling our sodas, but he was usually not far away or too busy so that wasn't a huge deal.  We went for lunch so it was pretty quiet then and we could just take our time and relax.  I'd go there again.

These dudes are AWESOME!!  We've had them at our house 3 times (must mean we like them). First time was because I put in for a quote on Thumbtack for replacing the Pressure Vacuum Breaker on the front of our house.  THEY WERE THE ONLY PLUMBER TO ACTUALLY SHOW UP TO THE HOUSE OUT OF 5 PLUMBERS!  The of course got the job!  A couple of months later we did some renos at our house and thought that installing a toilet would be cake, and we were wrong.  Got one in, but the other one had a rusted out flange, which we quickly realized that we did not know how to fix and neither did anybody at Home Depot.  ASAP Plumbing to the rescue!  It's so shocking how quickly they show up when you call!  It's like they want your business, and being a business owner myself I know exactly how important clients are!  They came over, replaced the flange, and were even going to put the new toilet on that we had already purchased, but low and behold the dang thing didn't fit. Even though he had put the whole toilet together and tried to install it, he didn't charge us a thing when it didn't fit.  He totally didn't have to do that!  The last time we had them over we had an emergency!  The water main coming into our house from the street had sprung a leak!  The yard had started to spout water puddles near the house so they came right out and the next day they replaced the whole underground line without having to dig up the entire yard.  Talk about impressed!  I was so afraid they were going to have to dig up the whole nicely landscaped front yard, but instead, just dug out a little at both ends of the pipe and had this cool tunneling device that followed along the length of the old pipe underground!  How cool is that!  They even said the new pex pipe is guaranteed for 50 years!  They even had a landscaper along to make everything beautiful when they were done.  How awesome is that!  You couldn't even tell they had been there!  Now let me ask you, how much do you think something like that would cost?  I thought it was going to be a fortune!  Was I glad when the final bill was under $950!  Amazing.    We will be using ASAP for all our plumbing and my real estate business and my clients! I guarantee!
