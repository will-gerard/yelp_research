The Arizona Science Center is a great local destination, suited mostly for kids. It's definitely much smaller than some of others I've been to in other states, but still overall a good time.  We've been here few times now, and one of the times was for an Adults Night Out. They had set up mini bars around the Science Center to grab drinks to enjoy while exploring. If you're going without kids then I definitely recommend going on one of those nights! Another time, we got tickets to the special POPnology exhibit. It was fun to learn more about technology and realize the evolution over the years.  Overall, I'd say the exhibits are entertaining, even for adults. If you're a kid at heart, I think you'll definitely enjoy learning about random scientific phenomenons and won't realize where the time has gone!

Updating my review for Welcome Diner after having been there a few times now! I will admit that if it weren't for my boyfriend who decided after the first time that he loved it, I probably wouldn't have gone back.  Anyways - I'm a huge fan of their fries, first and foremost. I get them every time. They're the thinner shoestring variety & come with a different kind of delicious creamy dipping sauce, rather than just ketchup. You can get them topped with jackfruit, pulled pork, or poutine. With one of the toppings, it's basically the size of a meal.  I also really like the bumblebee sandwich. The fried chicken is one of the best and it tastes great on their biscuit with some honey!  My boyfriend swears by the jackfruit po'boy & for good reason. It's really a tasty vegetarian option, which is commonly difficult to find at most places. While he's not vegetarian, it's his go-to option, and the first time he had it, he said that it tasted very similar to pulled pork!  Also, if you're a fan of fish, try out the fish po'boy. The tarter sauce that comes on it is smooth & creamy and balances out the tart coleslaw. My favorite part about it is that it's much lighter than the fried chicken.  They open later on in the day and are open until 2am. It's our #1 choice for a late night bite!

This is quite an enjoyable place to go especially when company is visiting from out of town. The area is really big so there are a lot of different desert plants to see & it takes a sufficient amount of time to walk around. They have a group guided tour for free if you're interested in that. We have been through twice now - once during the day time & also once when they had the Chihully exhibit during the night time. Both times were a pleasant experience although if you're going to the exhibit, it's definitely more worth it to go after the sun has set as the glass looks much more vibrant & beautiful. The only complaint is that the adult ticket is very expensive. Make sure you bring your student ID if you have one & a AAA card if you're a member for a discount!

We were driving around & decided to Yelp nearby restaurants. China Chili popped up in the list & had received good reviews, so we decided to stop by. The parking spaces in front & behind the restaurant are limited & when we got there, there were no spots open so we had to park on the street. When we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was much larger than it appeared from the outside & was pretty busy - a good first sign.  We were promptly seated & brought our drinks. We ordered the Fried Golden Prawns for an appetizer and the Chicken in Phoenix Nest & Sesame Chicken for our meal. The prawns were good but nothing special. There were sweet & sour and horseradish sauces on the table which were the only reason that the prawns had any taste. As for our meal, the Chicken in Phoenix Nest was in an interesting tasting sauce - the first couple of bites were good but left a weird after taste. I only ate 3 or 4 bites. The Sesame Chicken was the same way. I understand that it's a different preparation than the sweet American version but this plate just had a bunch of slices of fried chicken with a gravy tasting sauce poured on top. I only ended up eating about 4 or 5 bites of this as well & was done.  Additionally, one of the things we noticed was that our waiter was really nice. We had a few questions about the menu & he was more than happy and nice, answered everything. Some of the ladies who were waitresses there, however, were not friendly. They glared at people when walking around picking up plates & dropping off meals. It was a little un-comforting / intimidating to get these looks while eating. Overall, due to the taste of the food & experience, we probably will not be back.

We went to this museum after seeing multiple articles about it online. Overall, it was a really disappoint experience. There wasn't much to see - the museum was alright as far as the exhibits displayed go, but the walk outside wasn't that interesting. All the signs during the walk were really shiny making it ridiculously difficult to read the words ... Not sure why the AZ sun wasn't taken into account when making those. If you're looking to waste some time & have absolutely nothing else to do, sure, this will take up your time, but there are many other options that are worth the money & time.

After repeatedly going to a few of the same breakfast / brunch places, we figured we would try somewhere new! The Nosh Cafe came up in our Yelp search, so we went at around 11am on Saturday. There was only a short line in the front where they take orders, and I'm not sure how busy the cafe usually gets, but we were able to snag an empty table right away after ordering.   I got a create your own sandwich: toasted jalapeño cheese bagel with veggie cream cheese, turkey, tomatoes, sprouts, red onions, and cucumbers. The sandwich came with either a bag of chips, potato salad, or pasta salad; I chose the potato salad. My fiancé ordered the Mediterranean Omelet which had olives, onions, tomatoes, artichokes, spinach, & feta cheese. It came with a side of hash browns.  The first thing we noticed when our order was brought out to us is how large the portions were! The bagel sandwich had a ton of turkey on it along with very thinly sliced veggies. I thought it was good, however it didn't have any unique flavors that I haven't been able to get in the same type of sandwich elsewhere. I did consider when I initially ordered that their non-custom-made sandwiches would maybe be more unique, so I'd be willing to come back to try one of those.  The Mediterranean omelet, similar to the sandwich, was stuffed with a ton of toppings as well. My fiancé really liked it and was happy that they didn't skimp on anything, but he did say that the hash browns were just okay. We were not certain if they offer another side with the omelet but if we returned, he would definitely ask about it.  Overall, we had a good experience! Unfortunately, I can't see myself driving out of my way to come here, however it would be somewhere I would consider stopping by if I were already in the area.

I've been to My Wine Cellar previously & wasn't very impressed with the experience. Since our friends wanted to try it out, we decided to go back. It was not at all busy when we went & were told we could sit at any table. We really wanted to sit outside but were warned that there's a golf course behind the restaurant, thus there is a mosquito problem.  We grabbed a table & our waiter came to greet us & take our drink order right away. I thought it was disgusting that he acknowledged that there was a mosquito squashed on the page of the menu but gave it to me anyway. I think that it wouldn't have taken much effort to go grab another menu. It was his first day I guess.  We got the Oatmeal Stout beer & the pink Moscato for drinks and the bistro burger & the salmon cakes for our meal. Both of the food dishes were good. The bistro burger was large & filling and the side of fries was also tasty. I think for the price we paid for the salmon cakes, it would've been nice to get an actual side instead of just the spring greens.  The service was fine. I've been to wine bars before & enjoyed them more so I doubt we will be back.

We have driven by this restaurant & have seen the billboards that we finally decided to stop in. I guess that I should have gotten my expectations in order before going in.  I'm basing the number of stars I have given on the quality of the food. We ordered the double order of gyros .. Half regular & half chicken. It came with 2 large portions of meat, onions, tomatoes, & gyro sauce. By far, the best thing on the plate was the gyro sauce. The chicken was dry & tasted weird. I personally thought that the regular gyro was a little bit better but not by much. Additionally, as a side, we upgraded to the Greek fries, which was a mistake. The fries themselves were good (especially with the gyro sauce) but for $1.25 extra, it was not worth it for the little big of feta cheese sprinkled on top & a lemon wedge.  I will say that for the amount of money that we paid, the quantity was large. There are quite a few other Mediterranean places in town that I would prefer over this for the quality, however.

I've now been to a few Mediterranean places that are like this: market on one side and restaurant on the other, and Princess Mediterranean Market & Deli has been my favorite so far! We were greeted when we walked in and every single one of the staff members was really friendly the entire time we were there.  For dinner I got the chicken shawarma entree which is typically what I get at Mediterranean restaurants. The cost for the plate was $9 which included the chicken shawarma, garlic dipping sauce, a choice of three side (either garden salad, rice, arabic salad, hummus, baba ghannouge, tabouleh, or fries), and also pita bread. I chose the garden salad, rice, and hummus. My date got the gyro entree ($8) that came with tzatziki and chose the arabic salad, rice, and hummus.  We both really liked the hummus with pita bread, the rice, and thought both the salads were really good too. I was unable to eat the whole plate of food, but my date helped me out. The price was definitely really fair for what we got. I meant to grab baklava, but forgot. It was only $1 for a piece though ... We'll be back!

Great local frozen yogurt place! They had a small variety of frozen yogurts which change daily along with a variety of toppings. They have a selection of to-go frozen yogurts that aren't on their daily menu which is nice. Their offerings also included some snacks such as nachos & pretzels. The vanilla frozen yogurt with gummy bears was really good as were the nachos! I'll definitely be going back!

I love going to Coffee Rush, especially for the flavored iced tea. They have many different syrups to offer & you can mix a couple (as desired) to sweeten the tea. My favorite is the raspberry mango. Additionally, the frosts are really tasty, and it makes it that much better that all the drinks are well priced.  I also like that the store is right by the lake ... Makes for the perfect place to grab a coffee with a friend or go out on a date.

Abuelos is one of my favorite Mexican places in town for the food! I've tried a few different dishes & my favorites are the Durango burrito, Chicken enchiladas, & the Spinach enchiladas. The papas con chile & rice are delicious sides which I opt to get every time (instead of the beans).  They have lunch prices for these items which are very affordable & the portions are pretty large too. The dinner prices are only a little bit higher with slightly larger portions, still worth the cost.  If you're really hungry (or going to share a dish), then the fajita options are great because they're really big & super tasty too! Their margaritas are strong and make for the perfect start to the meal. The salsas they offer with the chips are different than they typical ones. There's a light green one that tastes sweet to start off with but definitely has a kick to it. They also have a regular mild salsa & a hotter one.  I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the service is kind of off sometimes. We've gone during lunch time and they've tried to seat us in a corner table when there are much better tables open and it's not even busy. I'll always ask them to seat us in the middle section up-front now, which is sometimes received with a snarky comment but other times, no comment. I've been opting to get things to-go more often now for this reason.

One star for this restaurant for the delicious Tequila Fettucine ... No additional stars for anything else. We decided to stop by CPK because I had a gift card and also had pretty high expectations because I've dined at other CPK locations.  We were seated promptly when we walked inside and it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress came by to introduce herself & from that moment, we were pretty put off by her attitude but kept an open mind. The service we received from her did not improve .. in fact, it just got worse. CPK has a pretty extensive menu so it was taking us a few minutes to decide what we wanted to get. It wasn't as though we were holding up other customers from being seated while taking our time, since, as I mentioned before, it was not busy at all - only a few of the tables had patrons the whole time we were there. We had to wait for a while for her to return to ask if we wanted anything else and she was very frazzled the whole time, running back and forth. From what we could see, she was only waiting 2 tables. Anyways, so long story short, we were very displeased on that front.  Moving on to the food. We ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine (substituted chicken for shrimp) and the Garlic Fettuccine with chicken and mushrooms. Both were good. The Garlic Fettuccine was lacking any flavor other than garlic but the chicken & mushrooms tasted good in it. We enjoyed both of those dishes so we thought we'd order some dessert. We decided to try some Beligian Chocolate Souffle Cake. It came out pretty quickly but we were horribly disappointed as it was served to us on a dirty plate. There were little food particles that had clearly dried up on it ... something that shouldn't have made it to our table. Considering that they were pretty obvious to us & we flagged down the manager right away to show him, it should've been pretty obvious to the person who put it on the plate as well. The manager asked us if we'd like another one or something else instead but at that point, we were done. It made us second guess the quality control of things that are being served at this restaurant, so I'm not sure we'll return.

My father & I went to Liberty Market years ago but didn't end up staying because of a long wait time. This time though, when we walked in the front entrance, we were greeted and really liked the the vibe so we figured we would wait. It took only about half an hour to put in our order which was less than expected looking at the line. The best part was that even though we had to order prior to sitting, we were given a number with a designated table so we didn't need to worry about others holding tables, etc.  We ordered the Crab Cake Po Boy with a side of roasted sweet potato salad ($1 extra for the side as their sandwiches normally come with chips) & the Pancakes with blueberries ($1 extra for the blueberries). Everything came out quickly & it looked great!  The blueberry pancakes were really fluffy & delicious with an ample helping of blueberries in each pancake. I think it's a bit of hit or miss when it comes to pancakes but these were so spot on! The Crab Cake Po Boy was also delicious; the crab cakes themselves were really light and seasoned well. I also really liked the chipotle aioli that was served with it. The portion size of this sandwich was really large, way too big for one person to finish. The accompanying sweet potato salad was also so so good! The reason why we got it is because when we were walking through the line, we passed by a case that had all the cold sides ... tricky tricky!  The other items in the pastry case also looked really good. Now that we know how quickly they get through the line & how delicious the food is, we'll most likely be frequent visitors!!

We had one horrible experience which was bad enough that I will not be returning. We went to lunch for a friends birthday. It wasn't busy when we went in & it took a while to get a waitress to take our order. We decided on the two salmon salads & both were horrible. For the amount of time it took to get the food, we were expecting something really tasty! ... No such luck. The salmon tasted weird & was way overcooked ... Completely charred.  We talked to the manager as a result of our bad meals & were offered a complementary dessert to make up for it. Knowing how long it took to place our order, to get our order, & the quality of the food, we should've known better. We thought we would give them a chance & get the Heathbar Mud Pie. At this point, we literally thought we were being punk'd. The ice-cream was really icy, the crunchy things were rock hard, etc. Don't even get me started on the amount of time it took us to get the check .. Thankfully, we just left cash to cover the bill & left! We were not pleased at all.

We decided to give a different YC's a try & had a very pleasant experience. It was a week night that we went & it wasn't very busy in the restaurant. We were promptly welcomed in & got started through the line. The item buffet was clean & well-maintained which was very pleasing. Obviously as it wasn't too busy, we got our food very quickly & were ready to eat.  The price includes a bowl of food along with some other items such as soup & ice-cream. I opted to get the chicken & vegetable soup (not sure what the official name is but it was chicken & vegetables in broth ... tasted like chicken noodle without the noodles) .. It was kept warm & tasted good. The bowl was also good. It was my fault that I didn't put enough sauce in the bowl so there was some water sprayed on my food to cook it. I guess my only complaint was that the sauce flavors didn't come through as a result of that, but I still enjoyed the meal.  We will be coming back to this location!

I had read a few reviews about Bahama Bucks on Yelp and I've been wanting to try it for a while ... We finally made it in! After the first few bites of our shaved ice, we definitely felt like we've been missing out!  We ordered the small root beer float shaved ice & the regular passion fruit & mango shaved ice, both topped with cream. I'd say that on the normal day, the small is definitely plenty (might have even gone for the baby size) but the regular is great for an extra treat. I personally liked the passion fruit a little bit better than the mango but the combination definitely worked well together. I think for the one I got, I would've skipped the cream. It was good (definitely didn't take away from the passion fruit & mango flavor) but it wasn't so impressive that I want to pay the extra little bit for it again. When I had ordered, the man working who suggest it had said that with the passion fruit & mango, it could go either way & he was right.  As far as the service goes, it was constantly busy but there were quite a few people working so we got our order in & got our shaved ice very quickly. We were offered a punch card as well. Minus one star, however, because when we went to the counter when we first walked in, one of the guys working was rude. He looked highly annoyed when I said that I had never been in and wanted suggestions and actually walked away! Another guy who was right next to him quickly stepped up and was helpful in picking out flavors. It's a bit expensive but so delicious! We'll be back!

One of my friend's super cute finds in the heart of Downtown Mesa! The best part was definitely the patio area which they've transformed into a very quaint environment for all to enjoy. A group of us went to Inside the Bungalow and brought along a few board games to play outside as the weather was absolutely perfect.  We ordered lunch at the cafe which was delivered to us in a very short amount of time. I got a sandwich with a side potato salad. Their food was delicious were their other treats. Many of us even went back to get something again!  I know that they not only have lunch but also coffee & pastries. I'd definitely recommend checking this place out with a group of friends or even if you just want to go by yourself. I can definitely see myself returning with a good book to enjoy some time alone!

This review is based on the food alone. Per a friend's recommendation, we went by and got takeout. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken combo which came with the Kung Pao chicken, an egg roll, two wontons, & fried rice. The fried rice was cooked and seasoned well, but it was a little bit on the salty side. The chicken itself was delicious. It was spicy but I enjoyed it, and the best part was that it was full of vegetables & peanuts. They definitely didn't skimp on the portion side. The egg roll & wontons were just okay.  I didn't order the crab angels but my friends did & I definitely regretted that. They were large & full of the cream cheese & tasted great with the sweet and sour sauce.  We will be back.

I've been to RA in the past & haven't been highly impressed with it but we thought we would check out this location. We asked for a table for two & were taken to the back of the restaurant. After stepping to that side, I immediately got a strong stench of something disgusting. It was so bad that we got a seat back up in the front area.  We had gone in for happy hour & yes, the prices are really high. I ended up ordering the RA'kin Shrimp & the Pineapple Cream Cheese Wontons. I was ok with the wontons but saw that the shrimp were not deveined. Considering the price (especially at almost $12 at regular price) I think that they should've taken the time to devein them. I spent a little bit less than $20 for just those two items with tax and tip.  Worth it? Definitely not. Will we return? Nope.

I think that this is basically your typical brewery restaurant ... nothing special that can be raved about. I'm not much into beer but have tried a few from their selection - the Hefeweizen & Sunbru are two I've liked. As far as the food goes, after going there a couple of times now and having tried a burger, some of their appetizers, and the fish & chips, I'd have to stay that if I go back, I'll stick to the fish & chips! I tried the popper burger made which chicken breast & it was extremely huge & messy/hard to eat. The fried onions were really oily & the chicken wasn't grilled well so it ended up being really dry. Their nachos & spinach artichoke dip aren't bad.  Keep in mind that at this location, parking is a little bit of a pain. They don't have much of a private parking lot so you'll have to find street parking. Plan on taking a little bit of walk to the restaurant because it's almost always ridiculously busy. Additionally, if you're going there as a group, they don't take reservations and require at least half of your party to be there before you can be added to their list to get a table. Even though they're busy, I do have to note that every time I've been there, the service was good and they were accommodating and offered to do separate checks if we wanted.

Cafe Lalibela is one of the restaurants we return to time after time. I've been here a few times with just one other person and also in a group; so far, I haven't been disappointed!  We normally get one of the combination plates which comes with a variety of different entree options and a generous side of injera bread. Out of the dishes we've tried, our favorites of the meat dishes have been the Doro Wat and the Key Sega Wat. From the vegetarian dishes, we've really liked the Tikil Gomen, the Miser Wat, and the Yekik Alicha. Each of them have their own unique taste and make for a really satisfying meal. Even though the menu says "spicy," I haven't found any of the options to be very spicy. They do have a lot of the Ethiopian seasonings so they're very flavorful.  Other than that, I'd say that their platters have very generous portions. Even though they say they feed 3, I think they'd feed 4 people. If you go in a group, I recommend getting a platter & adding 1 or 2 options depending on how many people are in your group!  They're typically pretty busy so at times you do have to wait and track them down to get drink refills. It's definitely worth trying out especially if you like to try something new!

After having been to a few different Indian restaurants in the valley, I'd say that this one is one of the better ones! Their buffet offers a quite a few vegetarian options including curries & samosas; they have 4 or 5 different kinds of chicken options - chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, karahi chicken, etc. along with egg curry. The best part is that with the buffet, you can also get naan, a plate of chaat, & mango lassi. The food is a little bit on the spicy side but it's really tasty. As with pretty much all buffets, the desserts aren't that great, a little bit surprising considering that they sell them in bulk. The highlights are definitely the mango lassi, naan, chicken tikka masala, & chaat! I will go back for those every time!

We've been to a couple of other comedy clubs in the Phoenix area and finally decided to go to the Tempe Improv on a Saturday night. Chris Titus was here and we had heard really good things about his show so we had high expectations. We didn't pre-purchase tickets, just got them right at the door. They were a bit slow in this process for whatever reason, however we had gotten there early enough so it wasn't a big deal.  We were seated in the middle area towards the back so we had a pretty good vantage point of the stage. The middle/big isle was behind me so I didn't feel cramped. I'd definitely recommend getting there about a half hour or so early, if not earlier, because the tables started filling up really fast after we got there. I imagine a lot of the shows are just as popular as the one we went to and fill up in the same way.  I definitely enjoyed the show! Chris Titus is a funny guy. If you're not a fan of kids or don't mind poking fun at parenthood, this is definitely a good show for you to see!  Additionally, the service during the show was good. We were greeted upon arrival and ordered drinks right away. Since there was a two drink minimum, we made it easy and told our server to get us a round of the same thing when he came by halfway through the show. I think it would definitely be a good idea if you want something different than what you originally order to just tell your server beforehand. There were some people a few seats away from us who were have a conversation multiple times with the waiter while the show was happening. It was a bit distracting to us as well as others around us.  Keep in mind this ends up being a fairly expensive date night. It was $50 for 2 tickets ($25 each), and the specialty cocktails were about $70 (2 drink minimum, so 4 total drinks each at $14 plus tax & 15% gratuity automatically added). I'm sure there are other options that satisfy the 2 drink minimum at a much lower price though. It was a fun experience for us, so we'll return.

I went to Haji-Baba with a group of 6 people and we were all pleased with our experience. There were an array of items ordered at the table; I got the chicken shawarma plate & others had gotten the combination plate (vegetarian & non-vegetarian), the chicken kabobs, etc.  As far as my dish goes, I thought the quality and quantity was spot on. The chicken was tender and delicious; it went really well with the rice and the garlic sauce was a good addition but I didn't find it to be necessary (which is not how it is at some other restaurants). I'm not a huge fan of tabouli but I liked how they had made it here, it didn't have an over-powering taste. I'm very critical of hummus typically and I enjoyed this one. It wasn't lemon-y and tasted so good with the pita. I snagged a couple of bites from my friends combination plate and I thought everything from that also tasted good.  As I said before - the quality and quantity was good, as was the price so I'd definitely return.

We were driving around the Tempe area when we stumbled upon Arai Pastry. The pictures that were posted on Yelp looked so good, we thought we'd go in to get a couple of things for dessert after dinner. Firstly, the little animal looking pastries are super cute ... too cute to order and eat!  I decided to get a piece of the vanilla cake filled with layers of strawberries, and my boyfriend got the fruit flan. Both were so delicious we couldn't stop taking one bite after the other. If you're only limited to one treat, I'd recommend the flan over the cake ... personal preference, but as I mentioned before, both were so good!  The service was really good too. They had a bunch of other options so we'll definitely be back in the future to try other things out!

After having walked by House of Tricks many times & seeing how busy it was, I was excited to take up the opportunity to go for lunch here with some friends. We had gone on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't too busy and they had conveniently seat us under two large umbrellas. They have a lovely patio area & with the perfect weather, we all really enjoyed the ambiance.  There were a variety of dishes ordered at our table .. The salmon with lettuce, the smoked pulled chicken sandwich, the frittata of the day, & the vegetarian sandwich. Everyone really enjoyed their food - the portions were big & the everyone agreed everything was really tasty. I was one who ordered the smoked pulled chicken sandwich. It was much different than any other BBQ chicken sandwich I've had -- it tasted good with the slaw, and the fried pickles added a unique flavor and crunch. I thought the highlight of the dish was the potato salad, however. The bacon added a special something but wasn't overpowering. I'd definitely recommend trying it out!  I will say that House of Tricks is a bit expensive for lunch time but it's a nice treat. I've heard great things about their dinner so I'm planning on returning for a date night!

As far as the food goes, this restaurant has one of the best tasting grilled chicken sandwiches! I order the same thing pretty much every time - the regular grilled chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese. Their topping bar is great too so you can help yourself. I typically get lettuce, tomato, onions, & mayonnaise. Their sides are good - my favorite is the onion rings but I've also tried the fries (sometimes a little salty), fried zucchini, & fried mushrooms. This restaurant also has delicious ranch dipping sauce which is one of my favorites for food like this. The line is almost always really long but well worth the wait. It's fun to watch them cook your food in front of you & they serve it cafeteria style. I will say however that a couple of times, when we've ordered our sides, they've gotten a bit cold or have been taken, especially since the wait is a bit longer for chicken to cook than the burgers. The prices are pretty reasonable & it's a great hang out place as well for groups.

Thai Basil on University Dr is absolutely delicious! When I lived closer to Tempe, it was one of the places I went to frequently, and I still make the drive to go there.  I typically get the Panang Curry with chicken but also really like the Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai. Every time I've gone with someone else they've enjoyed their meal as well. The veggies they use always seem crisp & fresh, and the spice level is always on point. If you ask for mild, it really is mild, if you ask for hot, they really bring on the heat!  My only note is that during lunch and dinner hours it gets really busy, and while they have parking in front of the restaurant, it fills up quickly. If you're going to get something to pick-up, I suggest going at an off-time so you don't run into any problems with that. Either way, the wait and parking pains are worth it!

Ka was the second Cirque Du Soleil show we saw in Las Vegas (first being Mystere) and we had a great time. As my date described it after it was over, "this show was epic!" -- Firstly, I really liked the MGM Grand. We didn't get a chance to go there the first time we were in the Vegas, but this time, we spent quite a bit of time there. The theatre was big and the seating was comfortable. We had seats in the lower half of the auditorium on the right side when facing the stage. It was a good vantage point to see everything that was happening.  The story itself was very easy to follow which I think made it even more entertaining. There were a lot of great tricks & martial arts moves, along with some comic relief. The thing I like best was the moving stage; it created some really dynamic scenes and gave the actors a lot of room to perform.  We're recommend this show to others when visiting Las Vegas. Try to get a seat in the lower half of the auditorium since there are intricate details which I imagine can't be seen from higher up. We've heard great things about Zumanity, O, & LOVE so we can't wait to visit again and see more Cirque shows!

We were walking around Downtown Phoenix after grabbing lunch and came upon Tammie Co Cakes. The store was small, but really cute ... Everything was Valentine's themed for the weekend! They had 3 different kinds of cupcakes (Coconut, Ooey Gooey, and Red Velvet), a few different kinds of cookies (Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, etc.), along with whole cakes, brownies, as well as some other kinds of dessert items.   My boyfriend and I decided to each get a cupcake. He got the Ooey Gooey which was a chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream, and I got the Red Velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. Both of us agreed that we preferred the Red Velvet cupcake over Chocolate cupcake because it was a bit more moist and the cream cheese frosting was more tasty than the vanilla buttercream. There was a lot of frosting on both cupcakes but it was less sweet than what I find at other cupcake places, so that was definitely a plus.  The cost of 2 cupcakes was $7 and some change. Although I probably wouldn't think of driving out to Phoenix to get a cupcake from Tammie Co Cakes, I'd definitely stop by to grab a sweet treat if I'm in the area!

This hidden gem is tucked away in the heart of downtown Glendale. Little Saigon is a very small restaurant and does not seat too many patrons at one time. When we went in, there was a couple leaving and we got their table, the last table available. There were only a couple of people working in the restaurant, but they were very efficient in getting drink & food orders, answering any questions, etc.  After a glance over the menu, I knew I was in the mood for some fried rice so I decided to get a grilled chicken plate and substituted for fried rice. My date got the most filling pho soup per recommendation from our waiter. I'm not a huge fan of pho, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. He said he'd definitely recommend it since it was flavorful and had a lot of meat; like our waiter said, it was very filling. As far as the rice dish goes - my only complaint about the chicken is that it was a very fatty piece. The fried rice however was really good. When we go next, I'd ask if I can get just the fried rice because it was the best thing on the plate, along with an order of the egg rolls. I might try one of the stir-fry noodle dishes as well.  The food & service was good, so we'll be back here in the future!

Every time we drive by Udupi Cafe, we think about stopping in & finally we got the chance to! We were really hoping for the buffet, but they only have that in the morning (11am-3pm daily).  After browsing the menu, we opted for the vegetable manchurian & the South Indian Thali. The Vegetable Manchurian was really tasty & was a very large portion (it was definitely priced well considering the quantity); the manchurian was a not very spicy, which I appreciated as I'm not a huge fan of spicy food (silly, I know, considering South Indian food is always really spicy). The South Indian Thali was very large as well & contained really spicy items ... It was also worth the money.  The service was good - it wasn't very busy on the week night that we went on & they had a new waitress - she asked us a couple of times if she could get anything out of the way when there was clearly still food remaining on all the plates - we didn't mind as she did note it was her first day. We'd definitely recommend this restaurant & will be back!

One of our favorite places to go to eat! We've gone there multiple times & have had a really good experience every time! Their hummus is absolutely to die for and the chicken kabobs & rice are two of my favorite menu items. I get the chicken plate pretty much every time. The only "complaint" I have is that I wish that the plate came with both hummus & rice like the gyro does. I'd say this is definitely my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the valley!

There was a festival in downtown Glendale and we were hungry so after we browsed some Yelp reviews, we decided to stop by Haus Murphy's. It was fairly busy, even at a later hour, but we were promptly seated. Our waitress came by and got us our drink order. We had ordered a couple of beers, which took a while for them to come but they were pretty good as expected.  I will preface this review by saying that I've never had German food before so I didn't really know what I was in for. We were really hungry so we started with the mushroom appetizer dish. It was definitely interesting - The filling was really mushy but flavorful; the cheese sauce it came with was the highlight on the plate. We also got the chicken schnitzel for our main meal. It was really bland / tasteless, mainly super greasy and sides that the meal came with weren't much better. Of course all of this was served up for a pretty pricey ticket. I'm not sure if I just don't like German food or what, but I don't see us coming back.

I love going to Olive & Ivy! I've been there probably 10 or 15 times now & haven't had a bad experience. The pesto & bread that's served before the meal is the best! You're able to buy the pesto at the little marketplace at the front of the restaurant. My favorite menu items are the Funghi Trifolita flatbread, the Turkey Grinder, and the Sweet Potato Cannelloni. They also offer a delicious $5 table-side mimosa for brunch & their peach bellini is also delicious. I've just walked in before & have been seated with my party within 10-15 minutes max, but I've made reservations for a table as well before (a few people & also a table of 10) which is really convenient. If you tell the waiter that you need split checks beforehand, they're really good about accommodating that. The service & food is so good, I keep going back!

I'm going to update my review for Olive and Ivy up to 4 stars. I've come back here with new friends to introduce them to the deliciousness and each has absolutely loved it!  Menu items that remain my favorite for brunch include the Turkey Grinder and Chicken Panini. For dinner I really like the Fungi Trifoliati flatbread, Mediterranean Salad (with either salmon well done or chicken), Sweet Potato Cannelloni, and Natural Chicken. The flatbread and salad are available on their lunch menu as well!  As I've mentioned in my previous reviews, the pesto and bread they serve is absolutely phenomenal. The patio area is great for a group get togethers. We've been out there a few times just to enjoy cocktails and appetizers. The main dining room also provides a great ambiance for a group dinner or intimate date night. We'll be back!

I'm basing this review on the Chocolate Almond Croissant only since I just got that and it has pretty much changed my life. It has a perfectly flaky, crispy crust and the filling is moist and delicious. I'm probably going to get this every time, whenever I go to Essence.  There are two things that left me bitter about this place:  1) The lady who works there is really rude. We went in the afternoon to try to get the almond chocolate croissant b/c my friend wanted to try it. She dismissed us right away and said, "we have what you see. That's it." Oh okay. Walking out then.  2) The fact that on the door, it says that it is open on Monday. I went there Monday at around 7:00am and of course it was closed. I went again another day and asked the same lady as referenced above about it. She said "oh yes, despite what the sign says on the door .." Umm? Why? Please change the sign & don't lie to the people who just want to get a croissant to start their day!

We've been to Gelato 64 a few times & I can officially say that this is my favorite gelato place to go!  They have a wide range of flavors .. Plain Vanilla to Chocolate Chilli to various fruit flavored selections. The Stracciatella is one of my favorites - it's a sweet cream gelato with chocolate shavings. The mango, guava, & peach flavors are really good.  Definitely try out a few flavors when you go! .. We will definitely keep coming back.

Whenever a group of us is planning on getting together for dinner in the Tempe area, it's only a matter of time before Cornish Pasty comes up. It's kind of shocking that we have been there so many times and can honestly say that we have never gotten anything that has left us disappointed!  A few of my go-to pasty choices are the Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Portobello Chicken. All though the fillings are great, my favorite part of the pasty is the soft, doughy, yet flaky outside. They seem to bake each one to the perfect golden brown! One pasty is pretty large, so depending on how hungry I am, I sometimes finish the whole thing but most times have some leftover.  They have a pretty extensive menu and the choices are so unique there's literally something for everyone. If you're vegetarian then you'll definitely be in luck because they have a whole list of vegetarian and vegan options too!  Unfortunately, the only dessert I've tried at Cornish Pasty has been the Shirley Temple's Pudding. It was so delicious (with both the creme anglaise and ice-cream) that I can only imagine how the rest of the desserts are! I definitely recommend saving room to get something.  Overall, the service is also good but it's a popular spot so they get pretty busy. The patio is large, great for groups to enjoy the Arizona weather during the cooler months, and also it's dog friendly! We'll definitely keep coming back.

I really wish that I could give this restaurant a better review because the food was really good. For the food alone, I'd give this place 4 stars.  We saw many great reviews on yelp for this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try. It was pretty busy when we went in which was expected as it was a Friday night. We expected a wait but there was none & we were seated promptly. The waitress was completely in a hurry & seemed like she wanted us to order right away. Since we had never been to the restaurant, we were taking a look through the menu & trying to make a decision.  After a few moments, we decided to order the Drunken Noodles with Chicken, medium spice & the Pad Garlic Sauce with Chicken, medium plus spice. About 25 minutes after we had ordered, we finally got our order. No one checked on us during that time to let us know our food was coming or asked us if we wanted to order something while we waited as it was going to be a while. Considering how hungry we were, we definitely would've ordered an appetizer.  Like previously mentioned, the food was really good. The Drunken Noodles were full of flavor & the spice level was just right. The Pad Garlic Sauce was the same way. It came with a side of steamed mixed vegetables, which honestly, I wish they would've tossed them in the garlic sauce with the chicken but since it was a large bowl, I mixed together the rice & vegetables in it.  I've eaten at quite a few different Thai restaurants in the area & it seemed like the portion sizes at this restaurant were smaller than what they normally are. For the taste, I guess it could be argued that it was worth the cost ... Maybe.  After we had finished our meal, our waitress came back & dropped off the check. She didn't ask if we wanted any dessert or how our meal was (no one checked in with us while we were eating either). Not sure if we will come back .. If we do, it'll probably just be to pick up an order.

The Gelato Spot was a random find of ours while walking around Old Town Scottsdale. Neither my date nor I were too incredibly hungry so we thought we'd get a couple of things to share. To start, we got the capriciossa pizza. It was absolutely delicious! It took a while to come out even though it wasn't too busy in the restaurant, however it was worth the wait. The crust was crispy and the toppings tasted really fresh. I'd definitely drive back there just for this!  After we were done with the pizza, we also got a couple of gelatos. They were super nice in offering samples which we took them up on. I ended up getting the Roasted Almond one & it was really tasty! Not only that, but it was also really light & airy. I believe that dessert goes to the place in  your stomach that doesn't exist which means you can have has much as you want ... right? Anyways, for this as well, we will be back!

I've had a few different smoothies at Jamba Juice - the Mango-a-go-go used to be really good but over time, I find it's now just really sweet & not too impressive. The Caribbean passion is the same way. When they introduced the Fit 'N Fruitful smoothies, I gave those a try, to only find myself disappointed. They almost just tasted watery & unappetizing. I haven't had the oatmeal in a while but it used to be a pleasant breakfast.  Since it's hot here 80% of the time, it's nice to get something cold & refreshing but when there are so many competing smoothie places, it's hard to choose Jamba as my place to go.

I understand that Joe's Farm Grill is very popular as a result of Diners, Drive-Ins,& Dives, but after going a couple of times, I fail to understand all the hype.  I've had both the Farm Chicken Sandwich & the BBQ Chicken Flatbread. The sandwich was not that great; I ordered it with American cheese & grilled onions ... & the fries that it came with left much to desire as they were ridiculously salty & greasy. The flatbread was not a much better alternative.  The price isn't worth the quality & the restaurant is out of the way from everything so I don't see myself making the drive out there much. Also, most of the seating is outdoors & there are a lot of flies. 2 stars is even being a little generous but it's nice to know they use local ingredients from the farm.

I went in to the store to pick up an order that was placed online. I first had to wait for a while until someone came up to the front to ask if needed assistance ... which I thought was fairly clear that I did since I was standing up at the cash register. After that, one gentleman looked for my order and couldn't find it so he called someone else up to find it. After the other gentleman finally came to help me, he said they had misplaced a piece of paper for the order that they need signed by me. I had to wait probably for another 7 or 10 minutes for him to print out the form so I could sign it. The only good thing however, was that BevMo was very accommodating. The order was placed by someone I know who lives out of town & I was able to go pick it up after they gave special instructions when placing the order online ... I just had to show my id.

Highly disappointed with our dining experience last night. I'd say that for the amount of money that we spent, we could've gotten a much better meal somewhere else. When we got to the restaurant, they told us it was going to be about a 15-30 minute wait ... we got our table in about 5 minutes. Good start! We were browsing through the menu & trying to make a decision during which time our waiter came by twice & asked if we had any questions. We said that we still needed a little bit of time but he was helpful in answering questions we had about the menu.  We decided on the Seafood Platter with a lobster bisque & the Crispy Alaskan Salmon. The Crispy Alaskan Salmon was pictured on the front of their menu & it looked like a hearty piece of salmon topped with plump shrimps & scallop on a bed of sautéed spinach ... my plate didn't reflect that. The salmon was cooked great (I had asked for it well done rather than the normal medium-rare to rare) whereas the shrimp were just okay - one was overcooked and one was not. The scallop was really squishy (for a lack of a better word) & the few pieces of crabmeat that were added to the plate were tasteless & could've been left off. Honestly, I think it would've made for a really good dish if the fish was served by itself next to some rice pilaf or steamed vegetables ... I would've much rather preferred that. As far as the Seafood Platter goes, it was your typical fried fish platter, nothing to rave about, even though it cost $27.  Lastly, it's to be noted that the service left much to be desired. After we had ordered our meals, we were brought a basket of bread and butter ... no silverware. There were two strips of bread in this basket: one which was soft & cut into two pieces and the other one which was not cut & quite hard. We didn't receive any silverware the first time we asked & had to ask again. The waiters caused some commotion at a table nearby after someone had dropped a water cup made of glass on the floor. None of them seemed very on top or quick about getting it cleaned up.  We did round out the evening by getting the bread pudding for dessert (our servers suggestion) & this $5 dessert was probably the best thing we had all evening! Overall, I'd say that if it was worth the money, I would go back to Pappadeaux's for the salmon; based on this experience, however, it's not likely that we'll be going back.

We returned here for dinner and had a much better experience than previously.  This time, we ordered the appetizer trio, shrimp gumbo, the fried shrimp & cajun chicken tenderloins platter, & the 2 catfish plate. We thought that the best thing on the trio platter was the shrimp & crawfish fondeaux! It was really creamy & tasted delicious with the crostini. The two other items on the plate were also worth mentioning; the hot salmon was really flavorful due to the honey mustard that it was topped with & the alligator sauce was really tasty (I've never had alligator & it wasn't for me but it was really crispy). The shrimp gumbo was interesting ... again, not for me but not bad either. Our dinner items we had ordered were good - the shrimp & chicken were both crispy & tasty, the catfish not as much but still okay.  I think that this restaurant, based on the service & food gets 3.5 stars (4 only b/c I really enjoyed the fondeaux!!). This would have been much more impressive of a restaurant if the prices were lower, but I'd leave it as an option for a once-in-a-blue-moon date night option.

We were in the area & decided to look on Yelp at what restaurants were nearby. Forefather's popped up at the top of the list & we saw that it had gotten pretty good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.  The gentleman at the cash register was really helpful & recommended the Steak Cheesesteak with Cheese Whiz, OMG! Style (with onions, mushrooms, & green peppers) and the Chicken Cheesesteak with Provolone, OMG! Style. We agreed & got those along with a side of fries. Their combo includes a free drink when you order a sandwich & any side.  The food came out really quickly & after only a couple of bites, it didn't seem worth it. Our combos were $11.25 each after tax ... Way overpriced. I only tried a bite of the steak so not much to comment about that but the chicken was cut too large & had no flavor ... the OMG didn't do much for it either. They had "fry sauce" too was basically just mayo & ketchup - not very impressive.  So, in conclusion: Was it bad? No, it wasn't bad; we ate what we ordered. Was it good? No, it wasn't good either ... and it was definitely nothing special where we will we return.

We went to Charleston's solely for the bread pudding & ended up leaving after a wonderful dining experience. The hostess seated us immediately upon arrival (unexpected at 7:30pm on a Friday night) & our waitress came by to take our drink and appetizer order soon after.  After browsing pictures on Yelp, it pretty much went without say that we were getting the Shrimp Cargot. It came out so piping hot that we had to wait a couple of minutes before digging into the delicious-ness. The escargot dish was filled with 6 succulent shrimp in a garlic butter sauce & was covered in havarti cheese; it was served with 2 pieces of garlic toast. The only qualm I had about this was that there wasn't enough garlic toast in ratio to the shrimp, however we enjoyed what was served.  Upon recommendation of our waitress, we ended up getting the Ribs & Oven Roasted Chicken combo, split. The Oven Roasted Chicken was by far the biggest disappointment. It was lacking flavor & any kind of pizzaz and was covered in a thick layer of fat which was highly unappetizing. I had to pick it all off. The ribs on the other hand were actually cooked really well and the mashed potatoes & baked beans were tasty. The portion size was definitely enough for two people to split (you may have leftovers depending on how hungry you are, if you get an appetizer, etc). The best part was that they brought everything out on two separate plates so we could just get to eating immediately.  Finally, we put in our order for dessert! Yes, I had VERY high expectations and yes, I was satisfied. We were presented with a beautiful piece of bread pudding that was topped with a Bourbon Whiskey sauce. When I pierced my spoon in the pudding & grabbed a bite, I immediately knew it was hot hot hot! Steam filled the air. After only the first bite, I was converted. It was the perfect amount of bread, cinnamon, and sauce but a bit heavy on the raisins; I think those could be lessened since it did start making the bread pudding seem overly sweet towards the end. The size was big so I got to take a little bit less than half home for the next day!  Charleston's doesn't have a very big menu but the choices offered seemed great. The service was also pretty on par so I'd recommend this restaurant to others.

I'll start my review off by stating that I specifically went to Spices to get Chicken Shawarma and Rice, so yes, I was really disappointed because they didn't have rice at the time I had gone, however, am basing my review off the food that I did end up getting. Spices re-opens for dinner at 4:30pm and unfortunately the rice wasn't done being cooked when I arrived around 4:50pm. I was given an expected time of about 15-20 minutes. I wasn't able to wait but in the back of my mind thought that they should've had it ready to go 20 minutes after re-opening. I'm not sure if this is an everyday thing or if they were just running behind on the day I went.  Anyways, I decided to still get the Chicken Shawarma plate which came with the shawarma, a small salad, french fries, and pita bread along with tahini sauce. I have to hand it to them for packing probably one of the best to-go boxes I've ever gotten! Pictures of the packing are posted! The salad (mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, & onions) was in a small container and the chicken shawarma was wrapped separately so the juices from both didn't mix together in the box and get the fries all soggy. The only thing I didn't like from the meal was the fries because they were way too salty. Also the tahini sauce was really bitter, but the chicken was flavorful enough and tasted great as a "wrap" in the pita with some salad that I didn't even need that sauce. I will ask for tzatsiki next time though!  The price of the meal was fair. Considering how tasty everything was, I'd go back to try the rice & arrive at a later time to make sure I get it!

A couple of words that will make your taste buds incredibly happy - Greek salad! ... So so good!  I've been to Pitta Souvli a few times now & have tried the chicken kabob pita, chicken shawarma pita, & the most recent time, the Greek salad. I was impressed with the chicken on the sandwiches but didn't care for everything else on it so I figured the Greek Salad might be worth a shot. I got a small one and was really disappointed in not getting the larger size since it was absolutely delicious! The salad has lettuce, tomatoes, olives, onions, feta cheese, and dressing. As previously mentioned the chicken is really good so I like getting the salad with it.  The prices are fairly high, especially considering how many Mediterranean places there are to pick from now, however it's family owned which is nice. As far as the service goes, I've only been by the restaurant to get take-out. They're really friendly, however unless you're dining in, I'd recommend calling ahead since the wait times are typically pretty long.

We were all pretty disappointed by the experience we had at The Farm Kitchen. Now that it's finally nice out, we decided to stop by for an early lunch. It's really confusing when patrons walk in because drinks are to be ordered first on one side of the counter and then meals on the other side of the counter. While it wasn't busy, it didn't make much sense & was even more so confusing because the menu was hung over the drink counter area where I believe it would have mad sense to have it above the counter area where the order is placed.  Other than that, this place is just completely over-priced. For a sandwich & a bottle of root beer, I paid almost $18! I got half of the Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich & half of the Pecan Chicken Salad sandwich; it wasn't even close to worth the money. The Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich lacked flavor because the turkey was essentially salt-less and the cranberry & aioli did not help make it any better. I enjoyed the Pecan Chicken Salad sandwich more, however it also needed a bit of salt to add flavor. Additionally, the sandwich order didn't come with a side of any sort! For that price, I don't think it would've been much to throw in some chips or a small salad on the side. My order took much longer than everyone else in my group & I had essentially ordered the same thing. It was kind of cute that each order was brought out in a little picnic basket so if you'd like, you can easily bring your food to one of the picnic tables under the trees.  The nice part a about this location is that the farm is really pretty, and as previously mentioned, the weather is much nicer now so it makes for a good spot to just hang out for a while. I've been out to Morning Glory before and although there's normally a really long wait, I'd definitely go over there over The Farm Kitchen.

We've gone to Brio a couple of times now and have been pleased. This most recent time, I went with my mom & bf and really enjoyed our experience. Our waitress came by after we were seated and took our drink orders immediately. She was great in coming by the entire night to check on us if we needed anything, got us drink refills, etc.  For food, my bf really wanted some eggplant. Although there's no entree with eggplant on the menu, our waitress said that the kitchen would be able to make eggplant parmesan. Exactly what he was looking for! Me and my mom shared the Pasta Brio with chicken. I snagged a bite of the eggplant and thought it was cooked well, the breading wasn't too thick & it was really flavorful. Only thing lacking was maybe a bit of the pasta sauce since there was quite a bit of pasta that came with the dish. The Pasta Brio was cooked al dente and even though the split portion looked small, it was actually very filling. My mom doesn't like mushrooms so I got all of them, which made me realize that there were actually more than I thought/expected! They didn't skimp on those nor the portion of chicken.  The prices of the entrees are a bit on the high side, however I think for the quality of food, I can still justify giving them a solid 4 stars. We'd recommend this restaurant to others.

Absolutely disgusted with this restaurant. I was looking up restaurants that had received good reviews in the area & found this one to try. I've never had Vietnamese food so I was really excited. We walked in and were promptly seated. It was really busy which we took as a really good sign. There were some big groups that had come in but the service was still on par - the waitress took our order & it wasn't very long before we got it.  I had ordered the Lat Na & my lunch companion ordered the House Pho'nomenal. The Lat Na was just some chicken, shrimp, & noodles in a sweet sauce ... Nothing flavorful. And I had ordered it at a 2 on a 1-5 scale & it came out pretty spicy. The chicken had a weird taste / smell & the shrimp wasn't much better ... It had the texture of frozen shrimp that had been overcooked. I tried a bite of the Pho & couldn't have much more than that but my companion enjoyed it.  The awful part was that the table was really sticky and there were soup spoons in a holder which I had to pick through 3 of them to find a clean one to use. Also, there were some patrons at a table just next to us who asked to move b/c there were ants all over their table. When we got to the front to pay our bill, we also saw some ants on the counter & there were 2 people who worked there standing right by them who made no effort to clean it up! Additionally, our to-go box was leaking ... Perhaps the ants had bitten through it.  We are definitely not going back!!

Stopped by Paradise Hawaiian BBQ during lunch time on a weekday. It was pretty crowded but they were getting through the line fairly quickly. I will say that the lady working the  counter was not friendly at all. She was hurrying people along which is understandable since it was busy but but no need to do it in a very rude way.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken with rice and 4 sides. The pasta salad was pretty good but the rest of it, including the chicken was just okay. I felt that it was nothing special, especially for $9 and some change. Based on this experience, I don't see any reason to come back and try anything else.

We found this restaurant while walking around one night in Old Town Scottsdale. They had a few menus outside of the restaurant & after taking a glance, we decided to go in. The first thing that impressed us was that their were prices were much lower than typical restaurants in the area AND on top of that, their happy hour doesn't end until 8:00pm .. way later than most restaurants! We sat out on the patio & there was a TV screen that had a slideshow of some of their menu items, all which looked absolutely delicious! We ended up ordering the turkey burger with regular french fries & the gladiator with sweet potato fries. The burger was a little dry but tasted okay ... The fries were probably the best thing on the plate. Based on the uniqueness of the menu items, we were a little bit disappointed that the sweet potato fries didn't come with their own dipping sauce. I think they have a very extensive menu and as previously mentioned, their menu items are unique. I'd say that this is more of a hangout type place much like most places in Old Town, where you'd go to enjoy drinks & some appetizers. I'd probably stop by to try brunch as we've heard it's really good.

Singh Farms is absolutely amazing! We went to their Farmer's Market on Saturday and had such a pleasant experience. The farm is located off Thomas Road and the 101 in a secluded area which is so beautiful! Since there has been quite a bit of rain the past week, the parking lot was terribly muddy. At first I didn't realize that there are actually two parking areas - the first one which is 20 minute parking & handicapped parking, and the second which is the regular parking. The second lot was much better than the first!  As I was saying previously, the farm area is really quite beautiful. There are a lot of trees, bushes, etc. that line multiple small walking trails. All throughout, they've made provisions of seating to enjoy your morning. The farm is actually much bigger than we thought, but it's still quaint enough that you can take a stroll around and enjoy the atmosphere for some time.  When we got there, we first took a look around the actual farmers market. They had many different types of vegetables, homemade breads, compound butters, pastries, and various other small edible items for sale. We were most fascinated with the homemade bread so we got a couple of loaves of it. They had set up small samples of their bread with olive oil and compound butter. The bread was so soft we knew we would really love it!  Since it was still really chilly in the morning, we got a cup of the creamy broccoli soup, super tasty, and walked over to one of the benches that was hidden amongst the trees. It was so nice to just sit there while listening to a man play the accordion, and enjoy the crisp, fresh air!  Among other food options, they also had probiotic sodas for sample (orange turmeric & root beer) ... definitely not my cup of tea, but they were interesting to try out! I did see others getting wood fired pizza, coffee, along with other beverages too!  This actually made for a really fun/different Saturday morning event for my boyfriend & me. We'd definitely return, even if it's just to get some yummy bread and soup ... and the serenity!

I'm a big fan of self-serve yogurt places & Yogurtland is one of my favorites. The peanut butter & cookies and cream frozen yogurt are two of the ones I get pretty much every time & the guava sorbet is delicious ... hopefully a flavor that will be permanently added to the rotation! I have to give this place minus one star because although the frozen yogurt is good, I've found that some of their fruit toppings aren't fresh & there are other yogurt places that offer a larger variety. Get their mobile app to get offers such as 3oz frozen yogurt free or check in on yelp for a discount!

We stopped by at The Buffet at ARIA based on a recommendation and we were definitely pleased! The brunch here was $29.99 (+tax & tip) and we were happy to find that there was a little bit for everyone!  My favorites were definitely the breakfast selections .. cute little baskets with waffles & french toast!! I thought some of the other delicious items were the blueberry blintz, the side of mashed potatoes & gravy, and general so's chicken & fried rice. The dessert selections were delicious as well, especially the panna cotta!  The services was spot on during the time we were eating. We got drink refills in a timely manner, our plates were cleared off our table while we got up to get another plate, and for what we received, we thought the buffet was very fairly priced.  Although the line to get in was long, we thought it was worth the wait. This has by far been the best buffets I've been to in Las Vegas!

We've only been here once & probably will not be returning. When we walked in, there were quite a few people waiting to be seated. We were at the door for probably like 15 or 20 minutes ... Only because we had heard so many good things about this place that we decided to wait. Finally someone came up to us to let us know to wait & we gave our names. We waited probably 30 or so minutes after that & I really wish we hadn't. We were seated at a small table in the corner next to a large party. We ordered the turkey pinwheels & bruschetta plus some drinks. Nothing was bad but nothing was great enough to rave about. The restaurant was so loud it was hard to speak & hear each other. There are definitely other wine & bruschetta places in town that offer much better food/drinks & service.

I've been to Culinary Dropout a couple of times; the first time I took it as a fluke since the service was so poor, but after another experience that was similar, I'd say it was not a fluke.  The first time we went in we opted to just sit at the bar & have drinks & dessert. No one was attentive; we had to flag down the bartender to take our order & get our check. Additionally, I got a lot of attitude when I told them that I didn't really like the dessert. Overall, it was just a blah experience, especially considering how much we paid for our order.  The second time we went, the service was a little better than the first time. We sat down for dinner & ordered the mac burger & the fried chicken. The coleslaw which came with the fried chicken wasn't very good; if ordered again, I'd get just the chicken with mashed potatoes & gravy. The mac burger was large & my date seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, however, I find that there's nothing great about the meal or the experience when dining at this restaurant. I understand there might be other meals that are worth the money but as I've experienced it, I can't justify going back & getting $16 fried chicken & mashed potatoes.

I had this restaurant bookmarked for a while after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. We were attending a show in Downtown Phoenix, so we went by La Santisima before that. It was around 6-ish in the evening when we arrived and there were only 1 or 2 small tables open, so we were seated immediately. Getting to the table was kind of like walking through a maze since the restaurant is small and crowded.  It was very obvious that they were super busy and there were only 2 people taking orders, delivering food, etc. It took a while for them to take our orders and then even longer to bring us chips to snack on & our drinks. When they did, however, we were more than happy to wait for our food as we were were enjoying all the different salsas with the chips!  The salsa bar they have is very unique. They had very flavorful salsas that I've never had before. My favorite was the peanut one. It was kind of thick and creamy with a bit of spice. Other salsas that both me and my boyfriend liked were the pecan salsa, the salsa roja, the guacamole, etc. There were a total of maybe 10 or 12 different ones, all that tasted great with the chips and also on our tacos. I'd come back here just because of the salsa bar!  As far as our food goes, I ordered the Tinga taco and the Cabo Shrimp taco plate with rice and beans. My boyfriend ordered the La Santisima Speciality tacos with chicken. Both the tacos I ordered were completely different from each other. The Tinga taco tasted good as it was served but I thought that the shrimp taco needed a couple of salsas to enhanced the flavor of the breaded shrimp. The La Santisima Speciality tacos were much like the Tinga taco in that there were a bunch of different toppings on them, so they tasted great as served. My boyfriend couldn't help but to add the delicious salsas on them anyways, however!  Next time, we come in, I'd probably skip both the rice & beans and instead order one more taco! It's not that the rice & beans weren't good, it was just that the tacos were SO GOOD! It's great that everything that can be ordered a la carte or as a meal. Some tacos are bit more expensive than other ones, but the whole menu seemed fairly reasonably priced.  Overall, like I've said, the food was great but the service is where there could be some improvement. We'd recommend this restaurant to others!

Not at all impressed by the food at India Oven. I've been here a couple of times & it's definitely going downhill. It was never that great to begin with but one huge noticeable change is how they bring out the tandoori chicken when you go for the buffet. Before, they used to serve it on a hot & sizzling fajita platter with onions & lemons & we went there just a couple of days ago and all they brought out was 2 pieces of cold tandoori chicken on a small plate. The chicken itself didn't taste good. As far as the buffet, it's nothing great ... actually, it was not even good. The mango lassi had a weird taste, super tart, almost as though it had gone bad. The two Indian chicken curry options had okay tasting gravy; the chicken was a little slimy though so I didn't eat it. The chilli chicken was not tasty at all, just spicy & it was almost like they had tried to make it Chinese style? The vegetarian options weren't much better either. My date & I were discussing the food as we were eating it & I think I said "I don't like that" enough times that I'm not going to be returning to this restaurant. The only thing I did say that was good, & in my opinion is a huge part of enjoying Indian food, was the garlic naan. Also, the service was on par, even when it was busy. Highly disappointed with my experience, especially when there aren't many Indian restaurants to eat at in the Gilbert area.

After having gone to India Oven a few times now, I'm updating my review for their buffet to 4 stars. I think it's great that they have it for dinner as well which is fairly uncommon to see for an Indian restaurant. For $12, you can have some good Indian food. The highlights of the buffet are the chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and the paneer tikka masala. Other solid options are also the palak saag, samosa, and pakoras. Everything is mildly spicy. The garlic naan that's brought out is always piping hot, soft and fluffy. I go mostly just for that!  Unlike other buffets, their desserts are also pretty good. They have carrot halwa and gulab jamuns which are served hot. Both are good.  I can't give it 5 stars because the service is sometimes on the slow side. I've noticed that when you go in a group, it takes a little bit to get naan and for them to clear plates, get the check, etc.

First review of the new year, so I figured I'd finally review one of my favorite lunch places! I was told about Arizona Sandwich Company by a colleague of mine and it's really dangerous that they're a fairly short drive from where I work! I've been here a few times now & their sandwiches have been so good.  I've tried the Sparky, the plain turkey, and also the Italian Grinder. Their sandwich ordering system works as follows: you pick a sandwich type, so basically the meat and cheese (or vegetarian) and then at the register they ask what you want on it. Everything on it means you get lettuce, tomato, provolone cheese, mayo, onions, mustard, and dressing. You can opt to get all/some/none of these. Each time I've gotten everything on my sandwich and it has been pretty packed and delicious! Sometimes their bread is a little on the dry side, so I wish that were better.  If you get one of the sandwiches that starts off at $5 & upgrade to a meal with a bag of chips & a large drink, the total comes out to only about $7 and some change! I think that's definitely a more than fair price for what you get since the sandwiches are large. I normally can eat only about half!  It gets really busy at lunch time, so I recommend going in before noon crowd. They're pretty fast at getting orders out though so you probably won't have to wait too long.

We've been to Stand Up, Scottsdale a few times now and have had a really good time on each occasion. The comedians are entertaining and always seem to do their best to put on a good show. We like that there's no drink minimum like some other comedy clubs but we typically end up getting a few drinks anyways. The Psychotic Episode is absolutely delicious!  Keep a lookout for their specials - The last time we went, we got 2 tickets, 2 drinks (beer, wine, or well drink), and popcorn for a very reasonable price. If you're planning on going a night there is a special, it will be busy so reserve your seats ahead of time & arrive early!

Found this hidden gem while randomly walking around downtown Phoenix. We had gone in because we wanted to just have a quick drink & coincidentally, it was about 8 minutes after Happy Hour had started (on a Saturday too which you don't find a lot of the time!). The bartender was really nice and listed off the items on the HH menu - we went with the house special for the day, the Rasputin. It was absolutely delicious & refreshing, especially in the Phoenix heat! It wasn't busy the day we had gone in but the waiters were telling us it's normally very busy. We're planning on going back one night when they have live music!

If you're in the mood for a cold treat then this is the perfect place to stop by in south Chandler to get one! Although they have many extra healthy options, I'm not a fan of those .. I guess when I do dessert, I have to go all out! Lol. My go-to is the cake batter fro yo with marshmallow sauce & chopped almonds.  The staff is always really friendly and the interior is really modern & clean. Definitely stop by when you get a chance!

First and foremost a piece of advice for you: get the MANGO LEMONADE!!  After spending a morning at a painting place in Old Town, we walked over to the Herb Box to get a late lunch. It wasn't too busy so we were promptly greeted & were seated at a table right away. Our drink orders were taken; my friend who normally gets the mango lemonade ordered it, and I'm so glad I decided to follow suite. I'll admit that throughout our meal I may or may not have had 3 glasses of it ... It was so good!  For my meal, I ordered the blackened salmon blt sandwich. I'm not sure that I've ever had bacon with salmon before (it was a little bit on the salty side) but it was pretty good. I'd consider asking them to lightly season the salmon next time (or leave the bacon off) as I preferred the taste of the red pepper aioli that was on the sandwich. The best part however, was probably the side of sweet potato chips. They were the perfect crunchy bites to accompany the sandwich.  Unfortunately, the service wasn't that great. We had to flag down our waitress a couple of times to get drink refills & get us our checks, etc. but I've heard some great brunch recommendations such as the red velvet pancakes & the french toast, so for the food I'll be back.

We were running errands in the Gilbert area and this restaurant came up in our Yelp Search. It's a pretty small restaurant but it wasn't too busy when we had gone in.  I ordered the #6 Combination Plate (which is as follows: grilled chicken burrito with pico de gallo, beans, guacamole, cheese smothered with Hatch Chile sauce and topped with sour cream) with only rice and my date got the #6 Combination Plate (which is: three Carne Asada tacos with onion, cilantro, tomatillo salsa) with rice and beans.  While we were waiting for our food, we enjoyed some free chips and salsa from their complimentary chips and salsa bar for dine-in customers. They had three types of salsa - a pico de gallo style, a green chile one, and a hot salsa. All were equally delicious ... the hot salsa definitely had a big kick to it and the other two salsas were really flavorful.  As far as the food goes, the burrito was really really big ... way bigger than I had expected it was going to be. I had ordered it smothered in the green chile sauce, which I thought was just okay but the chicken, beans, guacamole, and sour cream made for a delicious combination. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried a bite of the Carne Asada tacos and they were really good as well - they had the perfect amount of onions & cilantro to compliment but not overpower the meat.  Also, the price was definitely right. I paid $8  and some change for my giant meal, half of which was leftover. We'll be back.

If you're a fan of pizzas, pastas, & most importantly pizzokies then this is definitely the place for you! Of all the things I've tried at Oreganos, my favorites have been the vegetarian sandwich with waffle fries, the Alfredo the dark with chicken pasta dish, & the Pablo Picasso salad. I've also tried a few other times which haven't disappointed!  If you're going for lunch, they also have a pizza slice special. Don't be fooled, the slice you receive is really big & filling! The bowl o pasta is also a really good deal! All the items I've had have been very large in portion, ample serving to share.  Just a note that if you're planning to pick up an order, give yourself plenty of time. You might have to wait up to 30 minute for a salad on a busy night but it's worth it!

For my first experience I give Butters Pancakes & Cafe a 5 star rating! We went as a large group (10 people) on a Sunday for brunch. It was really busy and we had to wait a little bit over an hour but after everything was done, I definitely felt that it was worth it.  Firstly, I thought our waitress did a great job the entire time we were there. She was on top of taking our orders, keeping our cups filled with drinks, etc. There was a variety of items ordered at our table and per recommendation I ordered the Wildberry Bliss Toast. It wasn't a very long wait before we got our food and everything looked awesome. After only the first bite of french toast, I was totally hooked. It was a bit sweet but not overwhelming so; the mascarpone in the middle offset some of the sweetness too and it made for some really delicious bites.  Everyone seemed really pleased with the quality and quantity of food that was served to us. I'd love to return here & bring some more friends to enjoy the deliciousness!

I have now been back to Curry Corner a few times & must update my review! After trying out a variety of items like the paneer tikka masala, vegetable hundi, etc. I found the hidden gem .. the Chicken Makhni!  Most Indian restaurants serve their curries with rice, or nothing at all, so I'm happy to be able to be able to pick one or the other depending on my mood. Both taste equally good with but I prefer the soft yet crispy naan! The portion size of their dishes is large enough that I normally have some for dinner & the rest for lunch.  This place in on my way home from work so I often stop by to pick up a to-go order. They have it ready within 15 to 20 minutes. It's always piping hot & remains that way until I drive home. I've become a frequent visitor here & will continue to be one!

The staff up front is very nice; When you first walk in, they check you in & offer water or brewed iced tea. I don't get a haircut very often (maybe only once every 6 months) & have found that a lot of stylists don't know how to cut curly hair well. I've gone to see Marianne 3 or 4 times now and she does a good job. She listens to what I have to say & gives me advice on which style would look better as I normally have a couple of them in mind. The shampoo/conditioner & products they use are always great and leave my hair feeling clean & rejuvenated. I'm happy with this place.

Quite honestly I didn't have very high expectations for this place and what do you know - we didn't like ANY of the food we ordered. I got the chicken enchiladas plate with cilantro lime rice & black beans; my boyfriend got the shrimp enchilada and shredded beef taco combo plate with the borracho beans & latin fried potatoes. The enchilada sauce that the chicken enchiladas were smothered in was alright but unfortunately, the rice was undercooked to the point of crunchy and the black beans were just plain tasteless. The taco tasted like the shell was stale and the borracho beans tasted like they were cooked pinto beans on which someone had poured beer and served. The fried potatoes were really mushy & oily and salty.  When we had walked in to get a table, all we saw were people drinking huge margaritas. Apparently they must've known what we didn't - don't bother ordering any food .. or order after having a few drinks. Each of our meals were $7.57. I could've gotten a better deal at Taco Bell.

We decided to go here for lunch as it's close to my work. The food itself wasn't anything special. I ordered a chicken roll. The roll took a very long time for them to make & arrive at the table ... Wasn't worth the wait. It had a few pieces of chicken, bell peppers & onions and some really tart sauce in it. I wouldn't order it again.

We decided to go back to this restaurant for lunch. This time we both ordered the lunch bowl. The service was really fast and the food was really good. The rice bowl came with paneer masala, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, okra, garbanzo beans, & some cauliflower and potato. The paneer & chicken tikka were my favorites but the rest of the choices were good as well. The cost for the plate was $6.55 with tax. Definitely worth it! I'll definitely come back for it.

If you're in the area, stop by The Bagel Man for a bagel for breakfast ... you won't be disappointed! We finally found the opportune time to go in & I got something a little different - a cheese bagel with scallion cream cheese & my date got the Egg & Lox bagel with the works. The bagels were really big and fluffy; I'm hoping they're hot and fresh the entire day, but as we had gone in pretty early in the day, they definitely were. There was a bit too much cream cheese on the bagel but it was easily spread off.  I'm a huge fan of bagels as it is, so it's plain & simple - we'll be back!

I've been to batting cages outdoors but figured we would try out MVP Zone & hit some baseballs inside. We had reserved a time to go in but arrived a bit early; they were more than happy to just let us in right when we got there. We're not baseball players by any means, but we had just come in for a fun date night.  The facility itself is nice. They have bats, helmets, etc. everything you need. We'd definitely recommend this place if you want to practice or just date night like we did.

This is one if my favorite dessert places to go to! Each ice-cream sandwich is only $2 & you can mix-and-match any 2 cookies which any ice-cream flavor. The cookies are soft & slightly chewy and the ice-cream flavors are really good sandwiched between them! My favorite combinations are the white chocolate macadamia cookie with the black cherry ice-cream or the red velvet cookie with the strawberry ice-cream.

I've had my eye on Vintage 95 for a while & was super excited to have a chance to stop in.  The environment at this wine bar was super relaxing & we really enjoyed the entire time we were there. We started off with some drinks as we had gone for happy hour and then decided to accompany them with an order of the garlic fries & the brie with jam and walnut toast. For the cost of the fries, we thought there was an ample amount, they were garlic-y but not too garlic-y, and the dijonaise that came with them was an absolutely perfect dipping sauce. I'd definitely get them again. We felt similarly about the brie & toast, it was a perfect sized amount to go with some drinks.  We had a little snafu with our meal order but the staff / management was so gracious, we really appreciated it. I had a chance to look at their lunch menu and saw quite a few tempting sections ... We'll definitely be back!

I decided to go by another Dutch Bros to try something different & had a really pleasant experience. I ordered the Strawberry smoothie. It was absolutely delicious. I went back one more time and got a Strawberry Mango Smoothie which was equally if not even more delicious. I wish the prices were a little bit lower for the smoothie drinks but I think it's safe to say that I'm hooked!

We were so excited when we first heard that Postino's had opened closer to where we live ... It's definitely a great hangout spot! We've been there a couple of times now & have had the Bruschetta, the Grilled Cheese, & the Pub Board. I'd say that out of all the offerings, their bruschetta is definitely the best! The Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and the Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios are my favorites. The Pub Board & Grilled cheese were quite good (especially since the Grilled Cheese came with a variety of dipping sauces & the Pub Board was pretty large), but they weren't as good as the bruschetta. If you're a wine drinker,  $5 for a glass is a pretty good deal. The only thing is that the wait times are normally really long, especially if you go in the evening and because most people enjoy sitting & drinking wine while chatting with their party, the wait times they tell you are normally not very accurate.

We've gone to Sunny's a few times now for breakfast and I think it's very much the kind of breakfast place you'd expect in a college town - one that has mediocre food but decent prices. I've gotten the 2 eggs, home fries, sausage or bacon, & toast special which costs only $3.99. In my experience, the home fries are always mushy and pretty unappetizing & the turkey sausage is alway dry. The greek omelet is pretty tasty ... especially the side of tzatziki.  Our last experience with the service was interesting - our waitresses Jennifer came to check on us about 6 times within like 10 minutes! We placed our order & our food was brought out to us. She came to make sure everything looked okay - completely okay. She came back again 2 more times to ask if everything was okay - a little annoying. And what put us over the top was that she came over to our table right when I was putting my last bite of food in my mouth & asked if any plates can be taken away. Ummm, I guess? I know it wasn't all that busy at the place but this was just over the top!

By far my favorite brunch place in the East Valley! I have yet to try something that I don't like. So far, the crepes I keep going back to are the Vanilla Bean Custard & the First Time. The crepe itself is delicious but the vanilla bean custard on that crepe and the nutella & banana combination on the other makes them so delicious! It's also nice that they bring over a little snack while waiting for the order. I've introduced many people to this place as a result of the delicious food, low prices, prompt service, and laid back atmosphere. I will keep coming back over & over.

I'm fairly certain that crepe bar gets better and better each time we go. We went in today (on a Sunday) and got there a couple of minutes before 9:00am, right when it opens. It's a testament to how good this place is because there was already a long line out the door at that point. When the restaurant was open, we ordered, got a table, and were just getting settled in when we were given a small treat (some cereal) while we waited for our food to came out.  For the first time, I ordered the Breakfast Burro with Chorizo. It was really tasty - the Chorizo wasn't overwhelmingly spicy as it sometimes is, but rather complimented the chipotle drizzle, eggs, bacon, and avocado perfectly. Each bite was even more tasty than the previous one. The maple butter crepe with banana brûlée was also great, as is always is. I would order both again.  My date got the Grand Prix crepe. I tried a bite of it and really liked the coffee crepe, which makes me think that I'd like to try the Pick Me Up next time we go in. He said that it all tasted good and was very filling but probably wouldn't get it again. He liked my Breakfast Burro a lot and also liked the Duck Cuban more, which he has gotten in the past.  Throughout our meal, we noticed that the line was consistently long (pretty much out the door) and it was no different as we were walking out. I'm really glad that regardless of how busy they are, there's a lot of attention to detail put on the plate. The crepes come out spot on. We of course will be returning again, soon.

Previously I had only experienced the amazing-ness that's crepe bar in a sweet fashion, however this time, both me & my date decided to give the savory options a try. I ordered the Basil Chicken crepe & my date ordered the 13 Mile Crepe. With the check-in, we each got the delicious iced tea to start. I'd say that it was a solid minute & a half before someone came out to deliver food to another table that my date said, "we need that" and put in another order - it was for the Egg Up.  The Egg Up was brought out to us first - It was a delicious piece of brioche toast smothered with avocado & topped with an egg. It was served with a small side of greens (kind of?) tossed in a delicious vinaigrette which tasted really good when put on top of the toast! Looks were really deceiving because this was actually really filling. Then our crepes came out. The Basil Chicken was on point. I might have preferred it with a little less cheese but it tasted great. The 13 Mile Crepe was even better! All the fresh veggies were so well cooked & went well together with the crepe. We'd definitely order everything we had again!

Wow! What a shame that this is named the best buffet in Las Vegas! We were only staying on the strip for one night and Caesar's was what we chose for Saturday night dinner. When we got there, there was a fairly long line but we were prepared to wait. It didn't take too terribly long to get a table, and for $50/person (+ tax & tip) we were ready to have our turns at some delicious selections. After only the first plate, we were disappointed!  It was my dates goal to try a small portion of everything that he wanted & I did the same. The best items were by far the carved turkey, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes & gravy ... but honestly, how would you really mess those up?  We were highly disappointed by most of the rest of the selections. They had sushi, fresh seafood, Chinese options, meats/cheeses, fried foods, etc. Also, the best part really should've been dessert (I was hoping) but again, we ridiculously disappointed by those! They did have made-to-order crepes  which was nice, however there definitely wasn't enough nutella topping.  I understand that it was constantly busy but we didn't get very good service. Drinks were not refilled & plates stayed on our table for a while. I definitely wouldn't recommend this buffet .. There are many other options in the Vegas at much cheaper prices!

A group of five of us went to Bar Louie on a weekday for happy hour. We got the spinach artichoke dip, the cheese quesadilla, a chicken flatbread, and some drinks. The food was just alright and the drinks were not much better. Also, being that it was a weekday, it wasn't very busy but the server was not very attentive. We had to flag her down to order refills on drinks & more food. In fact, we probably would've ordered more if she would've come back around to properly take the orders. Considering that there are other restaurants in the area that also offer happy hour deals, we probably won't be back here anytime soon.

We stopped by Loco Patron for lunch & overall it was just an "ok" experience. It was pretty crowded but we were seated right away & our waitress came to get our drink & food orders promptly. I got the chicken taco with extra rice for my meal. There wasn't much flavor to the tacos nor the rice. My friend had the shrimp tacos & he said they were really good. Perhaps I should've ordered those. I think they have $1 tacos on Tuesdays for happy hour which might make them worth it.

We went by Hummus Xpress one evening and were very surprised. When we arrived, we were a little bit skeptical and debating whether or not to even go in but I'm really glad we did! This little place is pretty much like Chipotle with Mediterranean food.  I didn't really know what would taste good together so I honestly just followed the recommendations of who was making my bowl. I think I ended up with rice, chicken, cilantro jalapeño hummus, garlic herb potatoes, tabbouleh, and some toppings. My date has gotten a bowl with some fried eggplant which was delicious .. I regretted not getting that!  This place seems a little bit expensive for lunch - mostly because I normally don't want that much food anyway but it's still much less than other options. I'll be back!

We stopped by The Stand and I ordered two tacos ... the chicken taco & the vegetarian taco along with a side of fries. I wasn't much of a fan of either taco but the fries were pretty good. I understand having a simple, small menu, but it goes without saying that then, the items on the menu have to be amazing. It would've been nice to see a grilled chicken option in the burger category.  As far as the service goes, however, they're really nice and efficient at moving through the line and getting orders out. I wish I liked the food more because it really is a great concept!

When we got there (around 8:15 on a Sunday morning), we were seated right away. I ordered the cheese omelet (scrambled) with mushrooms, peppers, cheddar cheese & hash browns and white toast. The portion size was huge .. Looked like way more than 3 eggs. The eggs were really tasty as were the hash browns & strawberry preserves that was served with the toast. If I order the same thing again, I would leave the mushrooms & bell peppers off ($1 extra for each) b/c I didn't think it really needed them. The service was good & we took our ticket up to the counter to pay which made it easy. It was getting a lot busier by the time we were leaving so I'd definitely keep that in mind as well!

We've been back to Matt's Big Breakfast quite a few times now and after having had breakfast food at many other places in the valley, I have to update my review to 5-Stars!  I think that if you're a fan of breakfast foods then you'll be a fan of Matt's. My favorite item to get there is the cheese omelette (except I ask for it to be scrambled) with mushrooms, a side of the house potatoes, and sourdough toast. They serve all omelette dishes with 3 eggs so it's definitely a generous portion. Same for the potatoes, you'll get quite a bit of those as well, and they offer you an option of regular hash browns or the house potatoes. The house potatoes have lots of seasoning & taste different with rosemary ... I recommend trying them out! Even the toast tastes great as it's thick cut sourdough, and they serve it with yummy homemade preserves.  The only annoying parts are the parking situation and sometimes the wait time. Parking can sometimes be challenging to find and the wait time can be long if you are part of a large group. Either way, the food makes it all worth it!

Why get 1 hand pie when you can get 3 hand pies ... rrrright? Well, that's exactly what happened when I stopped by AZ Food Crafters! The man at the counter who was taking my order was patient and gave me a rundown of the hand pies they offer despite my arrival of only about 10 minutes before closing. They offer everything either served warmed, ready-to-eat, or frozen to take them home and re-heat at your convenience.  Of the warmed, ready-to-eat hand pies they had remaining, I decided to get the Apple & the Chocolate Cream. Then I remembered that I could get a free one with a Yelp check-in so I got the Tangerine hand pie as well.  As expected, I liked the Chocolate Cream the best. The filling was made of dark chocolate but it wasn't bitter and it was also soft and fluffy. Yum! Apple was also great. It was a bit tart, but it was the perfect sweetness so it made for a great treat. I liked the Tangerine the least of the three but it was still really good! It was very similar to the traditional lemon hand pie, but not tart at all ... great for this time of the year.  I can't wait to go back soon to try their savory hand pies .. particularly the Chicken Pot Pie! Definitely will be back & will recommend this place to others.

We decided to stop by Mika's Greek after seeing some positive Yelp reviews & I was definitely not disappointed.  I asked the friendly man at the register what he would recommend between the Greek Grilled Chicken pita & the Chicken Souvlaki pita ... he said the Greek Grilled Chicken so I got that with a side of fries. It wasn't busy at all so the food came out really fast and I could tell it was fresh since everything was way too piping hot to be consumed right away.  As for the taste, I'd say it was good. The pita came with diced tomatoes, onions, & their house made tzatziki. The chicken was a bit on the salty side but tasted good with combined with everything else.  I found it to be very clean inside the restaurant too, which was great. It was very modern looking & well maintained. I'll definitely be back.

I've been to this Snooze location a few times and had really good experiences! The first time I was part of a big group and the other times it was only me and one other person. Wait times were long in both instances but that was expected.  Each time, we've received good service & good food! We all really enjoyed the different eggs benny options and the pancakes too. My fiancés favorite one is the Winter Harvest Benny, and I personally like the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman. Our pancake favorites are the Pineapple Upside Down, Peanut Butter Cup, etc etc.  Overall, I'd be inclined to return to this location and recommend it!

I've heard so many good things about Joyride that I was super excited when the opportunity came up to try it out. I had very high expectations. I guess it goes to show, that time & time again, when expectations are high, they are hardly ever met.  My comments about the service are very positive .. No complaints at all. When we walked into the restaurant, there were quite a few tables open & the hostess let us pick where we sat. The establishment isn't that large, but it was kind nonetheless for her to offer us the option. In general, we noticed they are really quick about bringing chips & salsa to the table as they do it as soon as all patrons are seated. They are good at keeping water glasses filled, making sure any questions are answered about the menu, orders are put in right away, etc.  My comments about the food are not so positive. I opted to get three tacos (comes with a free side when you get 3) - the shrimp taco, the crispy fish taco, & the chicken tinga taco (the second two per recommendation of our waitress). None of them blew me away .. Nor were they even that good to mention to someone. The chicken tinga was just spicy, which I am ok with, but lacked flavor. The shrimp was the same way. I would say of the three, the crispy fish was the best, but again, nothing to rave about, & almost too heavy with the added stuff on top. I got the black beans as my side ... My mistake. They just tasted like beans out of a can topped with a little bit of cheese. No seasoning. I didn't understand nor enjoy them. My dining-mate got the veggie burrito & it was really good. For how much he paid, he enjoyed it & more.  Lastly, it's to be noted that there are a ton of flies in the restaurant. It was not only annoying, but also felt un-sanitary. I almost wanted to leave before we even ordered, but decided to stick around. I guess I should've gone with my original gut instinct!

I've been told about Republica Empanada by a few friends & it definitely lived up to the hype! I went in just to get a takeout order with the Republica Chicken, Bean & Cheese, and Fig & Caramel empanadas.  I'd order the Republica Chicken Empanada all day long! The chicken and vegetables filling was so delicious and seasoned so well. That would definitely be my #1 recommendation if you go in!  The Bean & Cheese Empanada was different than I expected but also good. It had whole black beans with melted cheese inside. While it didn't have too much seasoning, I'd say this is a good vegetarian option but probably not my first choice.  Lastly, the Fig & Caramel Empanada was a treat. It was really gooey with the caramel & cheese and had an interesting texture because of the figs. I picked out the figs and ate them separately, but I've never had caramel & cheese together before so that was definitely different.  All the Empanadas were fried the same so each had a delicious flaky crust. Next time I go in, I'll probably get a meal with the rice, beans, etc for some variety. The service was good too! Since it was my first time going in, they were good in making recommendations & got the food out quick. Definitely one of my new favorite places to eat!

We're happy to have found this little place that's in the middle of downtown Phoenix! We were walking around and happened to see a small street sign that pointed us to Melt. It wasn't too late yet so there was no wait when we walked into the small establishment. The staff promptly greeted us and offered us samples. We had never been here before so we gave a couple a try! Each flavor was unique and really delicious. I decided to get the mango sorbet which was really fluffy and just melted in my mouth. Also really unique is that they serve ice-cream in little Chinese take-out containers and also give a fortune cookie!  There's some seating outside but not much. Like I said previously, it wasn't too crowded when we got there so we were able to find a seat, however it got much busier by the time we were done enjoying our ice-cream.  I definitely recommend giving this place a try!

I've heard people say that the Food Truck Caravan is a bit hit or miss depending on the food trucks that come by on the given weekend, however on the occasions we've gone, we've had a pleasant time. I typically head over to their Facebook page to check out their weekly listing of which trucks are going to be there. Some of our favorite trucks are Frites Street, Waffle Love, Flippin Rice, and so on.  The ambiance is pleasant and it's great for a group of people to enjoy since there's always a variety of trucks present. If it's my boyfriend and I who are going together, we will each get dinner from a truck and then get dessert from another one to share. It normally gets really busy but we are still able to snag seats as someone else is getting up.  Minus one star because they always have music there which is way too loud! It's okay to listen to for some time, but then it gets overwhelming and tough to have a conversation with others. If you go late in the evening, the area does get a bit messy and it isn't well lit. We'll still come back to support the food trucks!

We have been wanting to go to The Gladly for a while now and finally had the opportunity to for New Years Eve. It was an absolutely fabulous experience!  I'll start with the service (because it was so good that it deserves to be mentioned). Our waitresses, Cecelia, was great the whole time we were there. She answered all the questions we had regarding their menu items & was spot on with the recommendations that she made.  I ordered the Moscow Mule to drink & it was delicious. This was my first Moscow Mule ever so I have nothing to compare it to but I enjoyed what was given to me. It was refreshing & enjoyable.  The food -  For our first course, we opted to get the original chopped salad since that's what the restaurant is know for. It's a very unique salad with a variety of flavors & textures. It actually confused me at first that the corn was so crunchy but I guess it made for a healthier alternative to crunchy croutons! They were right in suggesting to mix the salad up well to get a nice balance in very bite. I'd definitely order this again!  For the second course, I ordered the Chimichurri chicken & my date got the Duck Meatloaf. I tried some of the meatloaf and wasn't a fan because I don't like duck, however my date really enjoyed it. Not too many comments on my part about it other than: it  was very tender and I could cut through it with a fork. The grainy mash (for lack of better description) underneath it was also tasty and it made for a good balance with the sauce and meatloaf. The chicken dish was phenomenal! The potatoes came in a spicy delicious sauce and went so well with the chicken and the spices in the Chimichurri rub. It was a really hearty dish with lots of flavors packed in. My date tried some and liked it better than the meatloaf. I'd definitely recommend it & would order it again in the future.  Their dessert for NYE was different than what's on their regular menu; it was good as well. I'd say that the main dishes were the highlights of the entire experience. We will be back!

Wow! As someone who doesn't eat sushi at all, I had very low expectations for Harumi Sushi, even though I had heard lots of good things. From the first bite to the last bite, I was in sushi heaven! Cannot wait to go back for more!!  We arrived earlier in the evening on a Friday and snagged a parking spot across the street. It was actually pretty busy considering how early it was, but we were greeted immediately & seated towards the back. I would ask for a table closer to the front next time (the restaurant is very small but there seemed to be a lot of staff traffic in the back). Considering how good the sushi was, I'm sure it gets super busy, so I recommend going during off-hours.  Anyways, the sushi itself was amazing! I ordered the Las Vegas Roll and my fiancé got the Mini Roll Combo with three different rolls. I can't remember all the ones we picked for the combo but I do remember the Super Crunch Shrimp! It wasn't a traditional sushi roll, but I liked it because I'm a fan of shrimp! My favorite thing we got was the Las Vegas Roll but I was glad that we got to try four different items in one visit. Each option we had was unique and everything seemed really fresh.  The service was also good; all the waitresses were helping all tables, so if we needed anything, we just grabbed someone who was walking by. We will definitely be back & would recommend this restaurants to others.

A true gamers paradise! I have of course strolled by Gamestop at the mall & seen their various other locations but this is the one I frequent. Mostly, I go in to get my bf games (yes, yes, I'm the best) ... but I also have a 3ds, so I get games for me to play on there as well. The staff is always helpful in getting items located within the store, calling other stores in case they don't have what I'm looking for, etc.  We typically purchase pre-owned games and of the 20+ games that we've gotten, only one has ended up not working. Their policy does not allow returns of products that are pre-owned, so unfortunately we were out of luck on that particular one. If you ask them though, they will test out a game prior to your purchase, so I recommend doing that. We have gotten a fairly decent amount of money back on selling back other games, so definitely hold on to yours after you're done playing them!

Five stars for the food, four stars for the service, so overall a solid 4.5 stars for Ingo's.  It was a gloomy day in AZ, however the stars aligned as we pulled into the parking lot & were able to park in the last parking space AND THEN were able to walk inside & sit in the last two empty seats. We were greeted after a few minutes and decided to order the Ingo's Greyhound & red wine. The Greyhound was probably the best drink I've had in a long time! It was really refreshing with the grapefruit and mint, the perfect summer-time drink. This drink is $5 during happy hour!  After a glance over the menu, we went with an order of the Shattered Potato Chips, the Crispy Chicken Sammy, and the Farmer's Daughter Burger. Our potato chips came out first - I really liked the potatoes were fresh & were fried to a perfect crisp; they tasted great with the lebni which was a bit lemon-y with some spices in it. Our main meals came out shortly after and it was literally love after first bite! The Crispy Chicken Sammy was PHENOMENAL! The spicy sauce on there tasted perfect with the tart apples, and the perfectly fried chicken. As much as I want to try other items on the menu, I'm pretty certain that I'll probably be ordering this sandwich every time. My date reallynenjoyed the Farmer's Daughters Burger. I had a couple of bites and while I'm not a huge sauerkraut fan, I thought it did go well with the grilled onions & the burger itself.  I wasn't a fan of the service as our waitress was a bit rude. She wasn't very willing to answer questions & didn't ask if we wanted anything else. After the fact, I learned they have ice-cream sandwiches so we missed out on that, but we did get one of the salted chocolate chips cookies on the way out. Like I said, the food was so great so we'll definitely be back!

After looking at the high Yelp rating for this restaurant, we stopped by the Angry Crab Shack around 7:00pm on a weekend night. It was very busy; we were told it was going to about a 45 minute wait, but we were so excited to try it that we decided we would wait. We went by the bar to get some drinks - the waitress recommended the Hurricane as I asked for something fruity. It came in a cute little jar and was very tasty but didn't taste like it had much alcohol in it.  After we got our table and glanced through the menu, we decided to get an order of the gator nuggets, the hush puppies, the shrimp po boy, and a pound of the crawfish with the trifecta sauce, hot. It didn't take too long for the food to come out, so we started digging in right away. I personally didn't like the taste of the gator nuggets (I've never had gator before) but my date enjoyed them. The hush puppies were pretty good. They were a little bit dense but flavor was good. They had chopped jalapeños in them for a little kick. As far as the shrimp po boy goes, it was recommended to me because it was said to have lots of flavor (I was deciding between the fried shrimp basket and that) and I'd say I disagree with that. It had fried shrimp, mustard, and some slaw on it, all of which was not very tasty. I picked off the shrimp & just ate them by themselves. If I were to order again, I would've went with the fried shrimp since I was told that the basket comes with 6 shrimp whereas the po boy had 3. Lastly, the sauce that the crawfish were served in was absolutely delicious. I wasn't a fan of the taste of the crawfish itself but again, my date enjoyed them quite a bit.  I will say that the kicker came at the end when I overheard another waiter deliver someone else food to their table. They had ordered shrimp without the heads. The reason for why I hadn't just ordered the pound of shrimp initially was because the head/eyes freak me out. If I would have somehow known / been told / asked that I could order shrimp in that way (and gotten what I actually wanted), I probably would've had a much better dining experience. Our waitress wasn't very attentive through the night and we had to flag down someone else to get refills / more sauce, etc. Based on the prices & all, I'm not sure if we will be returning any time soon.

This was super overdue, but we FINALLY got a chance to go back to Angry Crab Shack. Unlike our previous experience, this one was absolutely AMAZING!!! The estimated wait time given to us was about 40 minutes so I grabbed a margarita from the bar, but it ended up only being about 20 or 25 minutes. Our waitress came by soon after to grab our order. I got a pound of shrimp, head off, with 4 pieces of sausage in medium trifecta sauce and a piece of cornbread. My boyfriend got a pound of the vegetables with 4 pieces of sausage in hot trifecta sauce and gumbo. It didn't take too long for our order to come out; everything was piping hot and looked absolutely delicious!  My shrimp was so so good. I'd say that medium was just the right amount of spice for me .. spicy but not too spicy with a lot of garlicky delicious flavor! The sausage was kind of an after-thought, and next time, I'd probably skip it just because the shrimp was so much food! Surprisingly, the vegetables were really good too. The bag had an array of different kinds including broccoli, bell peppers, even some pineapple, as well as ones that we actually didn't know what they were. I love cornbread as it is and thought the one here was phenomenal. It was more cake-y than what I've had at other restaurants, which was fine. It was super moist and had a bit of sweetness. My boyfriend who typically dislikes cornbread thought it was good too! Lastly, the gumbo was super tasty. It was thick and chunky with lots of little shrimp, pieces of sausage, etc etc.  The prices here for a pound of seafood are pretty fair. The next time I return though, I'd most likely be inclined to order just a big bowl of gumbo and cornbread.  Our waitress was really attentive during our visit. She made suggestions for food, came by to check on us, grabbed us refills and our check in a timely manner. Like I said previously, this experience so great, we'll definitely be back!

I'm a fan of the Fox Restaurant concepts & after visiting The Henry, I'll say I'm quite pleased with this restaurant! I came here for Sunday brunch with a group of people and we all had a great dining experience. A table was reserved for us so we were able to get seated upon arrival. Our drink orders were taken shortly after. We were waiting for a couple of people who were running late, but our waitress came by to make sure we had full cups of drinks, asked if we had questions, etc.  After a look over the menu, we all ordered a variety of different things, breakfast selections as well as lunch selections. I got the Wood Grilled Chicken sandwich with truffle fries. It was good; I wasn't super amazed with it, so I'm not sure I'll order it again, however I pretty much got exactly what I expected & what I was in the mood for. The only let down on the plate was the truffle fried which I upgraded to for an additional charge. They weren't crispy/crunchy, but more so soft/soggym however the truffle sauce that they came with was the saving grace.  Everyone else really enjoyed their meals. The cost was pretty high, especially for breakfast food, however I think it was worth the treat. I'd say The Henry is a great meeting place for a group. The decor inside is really pretty & the floor layout is very open so you're not sitting directly next to the table to your right or left. They also have a small coffee shop next to the restaurant, which I'd also be interested in trying out. I think we'll be back.

We found a deal on Groupon for Bad Water Brewing so my boyfriend & I have gone in for a quiet night out in Scottsdale. The groupon offer was for 2 beer flights & a charcuterie board which we enjoyed while playing Battleship & other games!  By far one of my favorite things about Bad Water is that it's very small & homey but there are some activities to do such as play board games or throw some darts at the dart board ... a little friendly competition!  As far as the charcuterie boards go, we've tried a few different ones. We've gotten the Desert Kettle board which I call the "jerky board" since it comes with 3 different types of jerky, some cheeses, a really yummy jam, and lavash. The Salud board is a mix of meats and cheeses which we liked as well. Also, the Noble Stave is also really good especially if you're not a fan of meats as it has a few different types of cheeses. I've heard this from many different people that the Blueberry Goat Cheese is their favorite and it's by far one of my favorites as well!  The beer that they have is good too. My boyfriends favorite is the saison. While i'm not a beer connoisseur, I enjoy getting the beer flight so I get a variety & have something to sip on.  The service is a little bit off sometimes, but overall, they do a good job. I'd definitely recommend this place for a date night or even with a group! The Groupon is an AMAZING deal so check that out before you go.

We have driven by Joe's Italian Ice many times & have seen the parking lot full almost every time, so on this hot AZ day, we stopped by. Firstly there were only a couple of ladies working so the line was moving rather slowly but when it was finally our turn, we received good service. I had a couple of questions about the flavors & would have probably been given a sample if I had asked for it.  I ended up selecting the small Wild Cherry Italian Ice. Was it good? Yes. Was it great? No. And would I get it again? Nah, probably not. Agreed, the price is cheap, but there was just nothing impressive or memorable about this place that will make me return any time soon.

After having seen My Waffle Crush multiple times at various food truck gatherings and not being hungry enough to try them out, I was very excited when I saw them at a location I could go to on a week night. I did indeed skip dinner and went straight to dessert!  The younger lady who was helping us make a decision when we got to the food truck was very friendly and patient. She made a few suggestions and I decided to order The Scoop and my date got a waffle with strawberries, raspberries, and cream.  The Scoop was good - it a waffle topped with nutella and ice-cream. The highlight was definitely the waffle. It came out warm and fluffy but had a little bit of a crush on the outside. Everything else on top was just a little bit too sweet for my taste so I honestly would just order a waffle plain without any toppings next time.  Can't wait to check them out again!

I've been to Uptown Art twice now and have had a great experience both times. The first time I went, the painting was of an owl which was pre-drawn and the second time, the painting was of a tree which was not pre-drawn. I'm glad the first time I went I didn't have to worry about drawing anything but rather could just focus & get used to mixing colors, painting on the canvas, etc. The second time was a little bit intimidating, but the painting turned out much to my liking.  One of the reasons for why I like this studio so much is because the staff is great. They're really willing to help you get your painting where you want it to be, whether it be assisting in getting the "right" colors as you want them or touching up parts of it to make things look better. At the same time, they're good about not taking over or hovering if you really just want to do your own thing.  My recommendation: Check out their calendar online & pre-register so it makes checking in super fast. Don't forget to bring a bottle of wine, snacks, & some good friends along when you come!

After hearing so much about Little Miss BBQ, when a group of people I know decided to go, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity. I will say there were some great things & some not so good things about this place.  I'll start with the not so good things. Firstly - parking. Yes. Like many others have mentioned, the lot is very small. I got to the restaurant at 10:30am & there were only 2 spots remaining. I definitely felt like a lucky one because there were multiple people waiting for a spot afterwards. Secondly - the wait time. I got there half an hour before the restaurant opened & even then the line was already long. I got to the front and got food at 12:10pm.  Now, let's move on to the great things. The people who work there are really nice. The first person I saw at the counter when we walked in was the owner. He was really friendly & helpful, handed out little samples of meat as we waited for our turn. I liked that they do everything by weight. Initially, I was pretty sold on getting either a BBQ pulled pork sandwich or a BBQ turkey sandwich (even though the first thing a friend said to me when I suggested that was, how do you think to get turkey at a brisket place?). Well he was right. What was I thinking? My mind changed very quickly when I was handed a small piece of brisket to taste; I ended up getting the brisket sandwich with a side of grits & a pecan pie.  I enjoyed the brisket, especially with the house BBQ sauce. It was so deliciously delicious there are no words to describe it. The meat was tender & juicy. There was some fatty brisket & lean brisket mixed & put on there - I might ask for just a little bit less of the fatty brisket next time ... However, yes. I wanted another sandwich when I was finished. The grits were a perfect compliment - a little bit spicy with the jalapeños & just deliciously creamy. I also wanted more of those. Heh. Just a note that even the pickles that came with meal were the "right kind" IMO - the hamburger pickles, none of that sweet pickle stuff. Lastly, the pecan pie was good, a little bit too sugary for my taste so I probably won't get it again.  I paid $16 and some change for my meal. I think that it was pretty expensive. No doubt that the food was good .. 1.5 hour wait & $16 good? Hmm.

Update to five stars! .. I won't even fudge the truth and will openly admit that I've spent quite a few hours in line (on different occasions) to get delicious food at Little Miss BBQ. The wait is always super long, even in the summer time, so if you're not a fan of waiting then I recommend gathering a bunch of friends together and putting in a to-go order!  I actually don't eat red meat at other places but when I go to Little Miss BBQ I save lots of space for lean brisket and cheesy jalapeño grits ... Sometimes the beans as well. The food speaks for itself & there really are no words to describe the deliciousness that is present on every plate. It's totally worth the wait! I actually really like getting one of the sandwiches best but since the wait is a long while, I get the 2 meat plate and save the leftovers for the next day.  Staff is always friendly & it's a treat to get a teaser bite of brisket before ordering. Of course I'll be back!

We decided to stop by Nekter for lunch. The gentleman at the cash register was really friendly & answered all of our questions regarding the menu. We ended up getting the Date Nut Smoothie & the PB bowl. Even though it was really busy, with a lot of people waiting for their order, it only took a few minutes to get both of our orders.  The Date Nut Smoothie was really good ... It tasted kind of like a banana nut cake in smoothie form - a little bit sweet, but not overdone. I had ordered the 24 oz which was a pretty big size. The PB Bowl was also really big but really good - contained the fruit smoothie-like mixture on bottom, topped with granola & fresh fruit.  Even though the prices of the menu items are high, it's nice that they use fresh ingredients. The place was clean & we were pleased with our experience, so we'd go back.

After coming here a few times & trying a few of the smoothie & bowl options, I have to say that for the amount of money you spend, it's not worth it.  The things I didn't like - I've had the Banana Berry Burst which was completely tasteless ... I can make a better strawberry banana smoothie at home. Also, the Pink Flamingo which is supposedly the best seller in the store ... I thought it tasted really weird, my guess is because of the coconut water (but it was really bright & fun to look at if that matters to you).  The two stars on their whole menu are the Date Nut smoothie & the PB bowl. Definitely stick to those if you go. Even then, I'd recommend to only go once in a while because the money you spend on these items is going to be an obscene amount. Disappointing.

As weird as it sounds, Fractured Prune has restored my faith in good donuts. I really liked the concept of being able to pick how you want your donut topped and was really happy that the execution was spot on. I stopped in with a craving for something chocolate-y so I went with the donut dipped in chocolate & topped with chocolate sprinkles. As much as I liked the chocolate, I actually was a huge fan of just the donut itself!  They have happy hour in the afternoon which I missed out on (didn't read the sign quick enough & wasn't allowed to add donuts after paying for the one). For $5, you get any 3 donuts; I'd be interested in going back to try other ones!

After having heard many stories of how much fun my friends have had at Topgolf, I was really excited to finally get a chance to play. We had gone on a Saturday afternoon so there was a little bit of a crowd, however the wait time to get a bay was much shorter then I expected. The cost at the time we went was $35/hour; since we were splitting it 8 ways, it was very affordable.  Our bay was on the second floor towards the end so we got an area with a table and couches. My only qualm with this was that it was a little bit uncomfortable because we all had ordered food, and we felt that it would've been easier if we would've had a high top table and chairs (I wonder if you can request a bay that has that?). The great part was that our waitress was on point in getting us food & drink refills quickly & made some good suggestions. The price of the food was about what I expected & everything we got was tasty. I recommend the smores!!  It's a good thing that we were just playing for fun because the scoring system is a little awkward. Sometimes someone would hit a really good shot and it would not go into one of the scoring zones so they're get 0 points & the next person would hit not as good of a shot but the ball would keep rolling and land in a high scoring zone. I'm not good at golf so I didn't have high expectations for myself. I thought lowest points normally wins in golf anyways, right?  All and all, it was a really good time so we'll be back!

I've been wanting to try The Original Chopshop for a while now & finally got around to going for dinner! I had heard from many friends that the protein bowls are delicious so I went with the Teriyaki Chicken Protein Bowl and my date got the Thai Chicken Protein Bowl.  The Teriyaki bowl had a nice sautéed blend of chicken in teriyaki sauce and roasted vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, onions, carrots, mushrooms, & brussles sprouts) which was topped with avocado & toasted sesame seeds. Between brown rice, forbidden rice, and sweet potato hash, I had selected the sweet potato hash; it complimented the rest of the flavors well.  I didn't particularly care for the Thai Chicken bowl but my date really enjoyed it. This bowl had chicken in a thai curry sauce with veggies (as previously mentioned minus the mushrooms & brussles sprouts). My date got it with the sweet potato hash as well.  Looks were very deceiving because the bowl filled us up quickly & we weren't hungry for hours after eating it. I'd say that the price is justifiable for what you get. Additionally, the location is perfect - right in Downtown Chandler & there was plenty of seating available for small & large groups. We'll be back!

Lunch is the way to go at NYPD Pizza. I've had the pepperoni & sausage calzone as well as the BBQ Chicken & Pizza Blanca slices. All of have been equally tasty; I just wish that they had more than the one standard pepperoni & sausage calzone option for lunch.  As far as prices go: one slice with tax is $3 and some change for their speciality pizzas. They offer other lunch specials (like 2 slices and a drink) for fairly reasonable prices as well.  I have only gone there and placed to-go orders so I don't know how their sit-down service is, however, the interactions I've had with the people who work there have been nothing but pleasant. They help with deciding what to get if you need it and get your food out quickly, even during the lunch rush.

I thought I had already updated my review to 5-stars but apparently I hadn't! My favorite thing about any place I go to eat is consistency ... Good food every time & good service every time. That's what I find whenever I go to NYPD pizza!  In my previous review, I mentioned how great their lunch specials are, but I soon came to find out that they have various great happy hour specials as well. $1-some for a slice of cheese pizza & only a little bit extra for toppings? Perfect when you work close by or are in the area! ... I would even make the drive since it has gotten to the point that I only get pizza from NYPD.  I'll definitely be back!

There are only a couple of places that I would say that I can go a countless number of times & not get sick of them ... Postino is one of them!  My favorite 4 bruschetta's for the board are the: prosciutto, figs, & mascarpone /// the fig spread, brie & apples /// the ricotta, dates, & pistachio /// and the burrata, bacon, tomatoes, & arugula. We've tried a couple of the seasonal bruschetta's as well as the panini's and haven't been disappointed.  I also have to make a comment about how great this new location is (I've only been to the Gilbert location previously). In the evening, it makes for the perfect romantic date night restaurant. We will definitely keep coming back!

After returning a few times to Postino, I haven't been quite as impressed with the seasonal bruschetta & needed a little bit of a change from getting the same regular menu ones. I decided to try the Vegetarian Panini and am very impressed. It's probably my go to selection now for a while (without the olives) until I get back on my bruschetta kick!

Fun little ice-cream shop in the streets of Old Town! Shakes & Cones is a bit on the expensive side, however they have organic soft serve which I've never seen before. It's super creamy, soft, and delicious, everything I hope for when I get soft serve!  I got just plain vanilla the couple of times I went with my friends, however I know they have a bunch of mix-ins to choose from. I thought the vanilla alone had a lot of flavor so I'd be tempted to get just that over and over!  If you're going to stop by, plan on just getting something and heading out right away. There's not much seating around, but it's a good choice for a cold treat on a hot day (or really any day) while exploring the downtown Scottsdale area!

We had gone to Mill Avenue and were walking around when we saw a couple of people from Ike's who were serving sample sandwich bites. My boyfriend & I each got one & thought they were absolutely delicious so we decided to go in for lunch. Ike himself was there! He was really nice and talked to us for quite a while.  After a look over the menu, we got the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian sandwich. It had grilled mushrooms, artichokes, cheese, and pesto. The sandwich was massive, and even though we shared it, both of us were full. My only complaint was that I don't typically care for artichokes but it was a little bit annoying that they had put whole pieces of them in the sandwich. The best part was definitely the pesto sauce and their house bread! It was fantastic.  I had sampled another sandwich called the Menage A Trois. It was also really tasty, and I'd definitely recommend that if you're looking for something that isn't vegetarian. Although I'm not vegetarian, I really liked the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian sandwich & thought the name was really clever for that very reason.  Ike's is a bit on the expensive side, however, it's great sandwich place if you're on Milll Ave! I'd recommend splitting a sandwich with someone if you go. I'll definitely be back!

I think it's ridiculously rude when a customer walks in & the person at the cash register is on their phone. This is exactly what happened when I walked in during lunch time today. After I had ordered, she went back to being on her phone. Absolutely distasteful customer service.  My Chocolate Peanut Butter bowl came out quickly. I had asked for it to go, which in hindsight I wish I hadn't as it was not all that great ... especially not for almost $9! I was absolutely appalled. I've enjoyed many acai bowls in the past & this one didn't stack up anywhere close to them. The only things good in the bowl were the toppings. The fruit (strawberries & banana) were over-ripe but the granola, almonds, and honey tasted good. So really the way I see it, I paid $9 for a handful of granola, a sprinkle of almonds, and a honey drizzle. Great. As far as the actual mixture goes, it had an odd taste, most likely because of the chocolate protein powder, and was way too liquid-y. I haven't ever had protein powder before and if this was a representation of what it tastes like then I will definitely be staying away. The mixture being too liquid-y was just a complete turn off.  For the amount of money & quality, I recommend not giving this place a try. I definitely won't be back.

What's better than waffles with toppings? Waffles with toppings AND fro yo! I loved the concept of Yo Waffle so my boyfriend & I headed out to Gilbert for dessert. You can basically make a custom waffle and/or fro yo treat with the plethora of flavors & toppings they offer. They have unique selections such as Tigers Blood sorbet along with classics like cake batter.  My delicious creation was a waffle topped with biscoff spread, chocolate & cake batter fro yo, and nutella drizzle. While the waffles here are not the best I've ever had, I really like how everything tastes together.  Minus one star because the service was really disappointing. The couple of people who were working completely ignored me & my boyfriend when we walked in! Despite seeing us standing at the counter (which we had gone up to for ordering waffles), they didn't even say hello & went to the back room. I had to literally ring the bell to get their attention.  It's a bit of a drive to go to Yo Waffle but I'd definitely check it out if you're in the area!

We went to this Bistro based on a recommendation. It wasn't very busy when we first went in & were able to put in an order right away. My friend & I both decided on the Rosemary Chicken Panini. Considering how busy it was (not too busy), it took a pretty long time to get our food.  Each sandwich was served with a small portion of greens topped with their mustard vinaigrette. I don't care much for greens but I'd say that the mustard vinaigrette was the best thing on the plate. I will preface by saying that I had made a substitution to my sandwich (ordered it with pesto instead of sundried tomatoes) but it didn't matter much since it didn't have the taste of pesto anyway. I thought the garlic spread had a really strong flavor and there was way too much cheese. There was also an off taste to the sandwich ... I'm not sure what it was. After only a few bites, I was tired of it.  The cookies looked so tempting that even though I wasn't too impressed with my meal, I thought I'd give it a chance. Probably should've thought twice because it got busier at the cash register & they switched cashiers to someone who wasn't at all efficient. It wasn't worth the few dollars I paid or the 10 minutes I waited for it. I'm not sure if I'll be back here.

After just my first visit to Fired Pie, I can definitively say that I'm going to be a huge supporter of this establishment!! Although I was a little bit uncertain about what to expect, I was very impressed by the choices that awaited me as I got in line.  I started off the pizza with olive oil and garlic & pesto sauce. I then asked for it to be topped it off with mozzarella cheese, BBQ chicken, sautéed onions, sautéed green peppers, lots of mushrooms, sautéed spinach and some pepperoncinis.  [[Silly me on the pepperoncinis, I'm not a huge fan so I'm not sure why I got them on there but no matter, I picked them off.]]  Everything else tasted so good! The pizza came out really quickly & the cheese was oozing and all my favorite toppings were to be found! I did opt to get the sautéed onions instead of the raw ones - the one thing I regret. And also, I got the sautéed green peppers but I think it would've been nice to have a raw green pepper option. I'm not sure what they use to sauté the peppers but they were slightly on the sour side, a bit off-putting. I'd leave them off next time but otherwise, I was really pleased with the pizza!  The service was really good & the price for what you get was fair. I'll be back!

Well, my first experience at the Waffle Love food truck was a very positive one! I had issues trying to figure out which one to get but decided on the Cinnamon Roll waffle. As expected, the portion size wasn't too large; the reason for why I liked this waffle so much was because it wasn't overly sweet like some others get depending on your choice of toppings. This one had cinnamon butter with cream cheese frosting. If I could get 10 of these at a time then I would!  Cannot wait to visit not only the food truck again, but also check out their new store in Gilbert!!

I had a doctors appointment nearby and was checking out options in the area to get something for breakfast; Raw Organic Juice Bar seemed like it would hit the spot! When I walked in, it smelled earthy ... odd, I know, but it was because of all the fresh ingredients they had. After a glance at the menu, I had absolutely no idea what to get. Someone working there was quick in asking me what I was looking for.  If you're curious - their liquid lunch replacements are the more filling smoothies whereas the traditional smoothies are "healthier" since they are not as filling but are made with greens, and the juices are exactly what you'd expect as they are packed with greens and other veggies.  I ended up selecting a liquid lunch replacement - the Nutty Monkey which was made of rice milk, bananas, dates, vanilla, hemp seeds, and almond butter. I think it tasted just about how I thought it would ... mostly like bananas and almond butter, but it definitely had some sweetness from the dates. The only thing was that I wish it had more of a thick smoothie consistency instead of a milky consistency.  Either way, the staff was great and the smoothie was good. When in the area again, I'd definitely stop by for another smoothie or maybe try out a juice.

Now that the city of Gilbert is expanding, I guess it's not the smartest / most ideal of plans to go to any of the restaurants in the Gilbert Downtown area due to the ridiculously long wait times. We decided we'd stop by because we really wanted to try Zinburger & figured we'd just grab a small something to snack on from the food trucks across the street while we waited ... for an hour and a half. I have never done that & will probably never do that again.  Once we finally got our table, we were seated outside on a chilly night literally in the corner by the one heater that was broken. Already not impressed. We weren't the only people who were cold / who questioned it either - the table next to us, also under the same broken heater, also were asking about getting some warmth. When our waiter came by, we were so hungry & annoyed by being seated in a bad spot that we put in our order immediately. I got the Turkey Sloppy Joe & my date got the Kobe Burger and we got an order of the Double Truffle Fries to share. Our food came out reasonably quickly considering how busy it was. My Turkey Sloppy Joe was cold and greasy. The Sloppy Joe ... sauce? I guess, was good and the sandwich was prepared okay, it just seemed like it had maybe been sitting there for a while as it had gotten soggy. My date was really excited about the Kobe Burger but was disappointed after only a bite or two. I'm not a beef eater, but he said compared to other burgers he's gotten at other places, there really wasn't anything special about it ... and if anything, it actually just tasted fatty. The fries were pretty good. They were lacking truffle flavor even though they were called Double Truffle Fries but the dipping sauce that came with it was really delicious.  I don't know how all the other items are but more likely than not, I won't be finding out!

Wow! By far the worst experience we've had at a restaurant in a while! It all started when we had to wait almost 5 minutes before we were actually even greeted at the front. It was interesting because I said to my date a couple of times, "I think we should just go!" -- Well, you know what they say about intuition. I should've stuck with mine. Even then, I had a very open mind as I was craving some good Mexican food.  We were seated at a table close to the bar & ordered the Margarita & Basil Drop drinks. The Margarita came out in a decent amount of time but the Basil Drop took quite a while. The menu said there were to be muddled blueberries in it; there were none to be seen. I probably would've sent that back but my date was enjoying it so we continued sipping away.  After a few glances over the menu, I decided to get the Tinga Taco & the Shrimp Taco and my date went with the Veggie Burrito & the Crispy Pork Belly taco. Out of the Tinga Taco & Shrimp Taco, I definitely preferred the Tinga. The chicken was really delicious and went well with the cabbage and creama; the shrimp taco on the other hand was a little disappointing as it lacked flavor & the shrimp were too dense. I've never had Crispy Pork Belly before but it was ridiculously fatty so when I took a bite all I could taste was fat, highly unappetizing. The Veggie Burrito was really big & filling but left much to be desired.  I do have to make note that the service was awful! We checked in & got a free order of the queso and we didn't get it for at least half an hour later. It had such a weird texture, we didn't even it it, such a shame too because it took over an hour and a half to get our food. We were so disappointed & quite frankly, I was still hungry but we figured we'd go somewhere else for dessert! I'm giving the 1-star because I have to and 1 additional star for the Tinga Taco.

We to Culinary Dropout one evening which I've seen many times right behind Mill Ave. The reason I was excited to go by was because it was still in Tempe but not right on Mill. It was really busy as it was a Saturday night but we were able to find a seat at the bar after just a few minutes of waiting. The bartenders were very helpful in recommending drinks and ensuring everyone got refills in a timely manner, etc.  During our outing here we ordered drinks & the pretzels and cheese fondue. The pretzel bites were really large, warm, and soft. They weren't overly salted & went well with the cheese dip and our drinks. I'd definitely recommend getting those to munch on.  It was really crowded so unfortunately we didn't get to play any games but they had ping pong tables & corn hole. Many of the patrons sitting at the tables seemed crowded by those standing around the bar area & wherever there was space; I definitely want to go back to enjoy some more time playing games & also grabbing some dinner at this location (we've been to the one in Scottsdale) but maybe when it's less busy like on a weekday.

Sadness fills me knowing that I used to work only a few miles away from where this is restaurant is located and that I no longer work there so I can't enjoy the Mascarpone Cheese & Butternut Squash filled Ravioli with Sage Butter Sauce on a regular basis.  With that said, my experience was as follows. When I first walked in, I could tell that I was going to enjoy my food. It's a pretty small place but still, they have a good size menu and it appeared they were making everything by hand. After glancing over the items offered, I asked for recommendations (even though I kind of knew what I was going to get) and settled on the Mascarpone Cheese & Butternut Squash filled Ravioli. I had ordered it to go and it came out fairly quickly; the wait was not much later than expected. I did have to have a quick bite before leaving the parking lot ... BIG mistake, because after that I was hooked! The ravioli is so tasty there really is no perfect way to describe it. It's soft and creamy from the Mascarpone Cheese and has a hint of sweetness from the Butternut Squash, and the Sage Butter just makes it so well balanced. There's not much more to say except that it left me wanting more!  My only comments about why the minus one star are: for the price, I thought the portion was a little bit small. The garlic bread it came with was fairly tasteless & really underwhelming. I think it would've made for a better plate if the garlic bread was left off & a few more pieces of ravioli were there.

A hole-in-the-wall place in Chandler that I'm a huge fan of! I've only had Peruvian food once before when we were in New York so I don't have much to compare it to however we had a delicious dining experience at Tumi.  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and seated and our drink order was brought out. Our waitress was patient and answered our questions about the menu items; we went with an appetizer that consisted of mashed potatoes and chicken salad with a yellow sauce & chicken wing on the side (sorry, I didn't write down the name!). It was interesting, definitely not anything like what I've had before. I'm not sure that I would order it again because I wasn't a fan of the warm chicken salad but I'm glad we decided to try it out.  For our main meals, I ordered the pollo saltado & my date ordered the lomo saltado. Both were really delicious. I'm not a huge fan of steak which is why I preferred the chicken and it went really well with the sauce and vegetables along with the french fries. I definitely come back over and over for this dish!  The only thing is, for the portion served, I found this restaurant to be a bit on the expensive side. Tumi is definitely a great place if I want to treat myself but not a place I'd go frequently.

My friend and I met up at Fez for a causal lunch. I had been to their old location a few years ago & had really enjoyed it mostly because of the atmosphere. It was really relaxed and the food was good too. This visit, much like my previous visit, was pleasant.  For our meals, I got the Fez burger (with chicken instead of beef) & a side of fries and my friend got the Fez salad. The sandwich was a bit hard to eat because they're very generous with the sauce, and that paired with the pear & feta cheese is a bit sloppy but absolutely delicious. My friend said her salad was good too!  I'd definitely recommend trying the g-spot to drink. I'm not much of a grapefruit fan but per recommendation of our waitress I got it. It was super refreshing & delicious, especially for the summer time.  I will say that the service was absolutely terribly slow even though it wasn't busy at all! It took a while for our server to come by and get our drink/food order & then it really took way too long to get our checks. Since we had the afternoon to kill, we were ok spending a little bit more time there than anticipated, however.  I liked that there was a large parking structure right by the restaurant so having to look for parking wasn't an issue. I'd definitely recommend this place if you have time to spare. We'll be back in the future.

I was really excited to try Puerto Rican food since I've never had it before, and per recommendation from a friend, I ended up at FrinGo's Kitchen. Think of a small family owned restaurant and this is the perfect example of that! I had gone closer towards closing time to pick up a meal; I was warmly welcomed in & received a brief rundown of the menu.  I finally decided on the Pollo Guisado (chicken with potatoes) with half Arroz con Gandules (rice with pigeon peas & ham)  & half Arroz Blanco (white rice) and the Habichuelas Guisada (beans). The chicken & potatoes were definitely the highlight of the meal - the chicken was perfectly cooked & was just falling apart perfectly off the bone. The beans were tasty as were both the rice items; each had its own unique flavor. If you get the chicken, I'd recommend getting just the white rice since it went really well with the broth. The only note I had was that the food was a little bit salty, but otherwise delicious.  Everything was already made & served cafeteria-style so it was a quick trip in & out. There were a lot of interesting items on the menu so I'll be returning to give those a try.

My fiancé has been wanting to go to Milk Bar for a while now, but it took some convincing on his part to get me there. I'm glad we ended up going because we had a good experience!  First: the atmosphere. It was still a bit earlier in the evening when we got there, around 6:30pm or so. We walked into the restaurant and were taken to a table on the outside patio. Our waiter came by, grabbed our drink order, and gave us time to look over the menu. Unfortunately, before we even got our drinks, a few people came out to smoke. I really didn't want to be around that while we ate, so we talked to the hostess who was more than happy to re-seat us to another table inside. It was in the back area of that restaurant away from the other tables. I'd definitely say it's a cute little area to request, especially if you're on a date! The best part about sitting inside was actually the music. It was at a perfect loudness - low enough that it wasn't difficult to hear what the other was saying, but loud enough that it created a zen-kind of environment.  Secondly: the service. As a result of us moving to a table inside, we had a waitress helping us out. She was attentive but the waiter outside was definitely friendlier. She came by to ask if we needed anything, got our check in a timely manner, etc. No complaints.  Thirdly: the drinks/food. This is probably the reason for why I can't quite give Milk Bar 5-stars. I had gotten a Krakow Mule and my boyfriend got a dark beer (I can't remember the name). Both were really good so our night was off to a good start. Our original waiter had told us that all the items are served tapas-style so we got a few things to share: three jalapeño & cheese pierogies with salsa & cream cheese / three farmers cheese & potato pierogies with vodka sour cream / potato pancakes with sour cream & applesauce / and tacos. It was interesting how the two pierogies were so different from each other. The jalapeño & cheese had a crispy outer cover whereas the farmers cheese & potato had a boiled outer cover. By far the best thing at the table was the salsa & sour cream that came with the jalapeño & cheese pierogies! It was almost like a spicy-sweet & sour sauce with cream cheese. I wasn't much of a fan of the tacos mostly because of the kielbasa, however my boyfriend enjoyed them. And lastly, I thought the potato pancakes were way too greasy that they were difficult to eat! I would skip the latter two items, but would recommend the pierogies.  Overall, like I said perviously, I'm glad that I was finally convinced to visit Milk Bar. I think the next time I come back, I'll plan ahead, eat a little something before coming in, and just get drinks and some pierogies!

After having seen some reviews from friends on Yelp, it was in my plans to try Glacier Snow Sweets & Treats. I noticed right away when I first walked in that the establishment was very clean & modern looking. After a quick glance at the menu, I decided on the Mango Smoothie with Boba. It had a very strong Mango flavor which I know some smoothies lack and made for a yummy mid-day treat. Next time, however, I'd pass on the boba.  Just a note: the people ahead of me all ordered the snow & it looked fluffy & delicious! I'm definitely coming back b/c I want to give that a try. I saw a photo on Yelp of loyalty cards & completely spaced to ask for one.

Updating my review to 5 stars!  I absolutely love going to Glacier, especially after a long day at work or on the weekend to get a sweet treat. Grace, the owner, is by far one of the nicest people ever & always welcomes me with a smile. Everyone else is great in welcoming guests too!  After trying out a few different things, I'd say that my favorite items are the Halo Halo & the pistachio snow with condensed milk. I've had Halo Halo at other places now and Glacier, in my opinion, does it best! Their snow is always super light and fluffy and not overly sweet. I never feel guilty about getting a small one to enjoy. They have lots of different snow flavors to choose from, and you can build your own with toppings or get one of the special ones. You can also get a smoothie or iced tea.  If you're going in with a group, they have some games to play while you eat dessert so keep that in mind. I definitely recommend trying them out!

Thank you Pinspiration for a fun night! I had seen this place come up on Yelp and couldn't wait to check it out since I've been working on channeling my creative side. A Groupon came up for a Splatter Date so I thought I'd purchase it to share a fun date night with my boyfriend. It included the following: a cheese/crackers/chocolate plate, 2 glasses of champagne, and either 1 big canvas or 2 small canvases.  When we got there, they had the snack plate already set up for us along with all of our paint "equipment" - smocks, booties, and goggles. We were shown back to the Splatter room in which we had 20 minutes in to create our masterpieces. There were a few different paints set up for our use. We definitely had a lot of fun during our time in the room! 20 minutes isn't too much time, but it was enough for us to get some solid splatters onto our canvas. Just a note - the canvas doesn't have anything on the back to hang it up so you'll have buy that to get it up on the wall.  Since we had gone a bit later in the evening (reservation for 8:00pm), we were the last people in the Splatter room. They close at 10:00pm so we let our paintings dry while we walked around High Street. The paintings typically take a couple of hours to dry so they gave us some newspaper for the car since ours hadn't come close to drying yet.  Overall, it was a really fun night. I'd recommend this place to others for a fun, unique evening. Maybe go a bit earlier in the day for the splatter experience, grab food or drinks in the area while your painting dries, and then go back to pick it up.

We were trying to find somewhere to eat in downtown Phoenix when I remembered having bookmarked Desoto Market a while ago. We arrived and walked to the restaurant area where there was a yummy Asian food smell in the air! This is how we ended up in front of Adobo Dragon. Now, months ago, one of my friends had mentioned this restaurant to me, so when I saw this is where it was located, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get something.  It's a very tiny place but as I mentioned, the food they were making smelled so good! Their menu offerings included a few different types of noodles, bao (steamed buns), as well as bento boxes. I was told that the most popular menu items are the Curried Noodles, Chicken Bao, & Chicken Bento Box. I decided to get the Curried Noodles & my fiancé got the Chicken Bao plate.  Firstly, the Curried Noodles were served with 4 grilled shrimp and a small side salad. The noodles had flavorful curry taste and the side salad had a vinaigrette to bring a lightness to the dish. I think the only mistake I made was not mixing up the noodles before eating because there was a bunch of curry on the bottom of my dish which I noticed only after most of the noodles were gone.  The star, by far, was the Chicken Bao though. I immediately regretted not getting those! The plate had two steamed buns and a small salad. The chicken itself had a lot of flavor and made a really tasty combination with the mango salsa. It didn't look like a lot of food, and I only had a couple of bites, but my fiancé said he felt really full after eating both.  We will definitely be back to try a couple of the other Bao options. The menu descriptions sounded really tempting for the salmon one as well as the vegetarian with sautéed mushrooms. They have happy hour specials for $3 as well!

We found out about Nothing Bundt Cakes as a friend had brought bundtinis to a party. We've since gone back & gotten quite a few different bundtlets. My favorites have been the lemon & red velvet ... I've also tried the chocolate chocolate chip, white chocolate raspberry, & marble which have been good. I'd say that for the size & price of the bundtlet, it's worth it. Like their Facebook page and/or sign up for newsletter as they send out an offer for buy 1 get 1 free bundtlets pretty often!

If I'm craving a salad then Mad Greens is the first place that comes to mind! I've been to the location at Tempe Marketplace a few times now and have had nothing but good experiences. While their salads are a bit on the expensive side, I don't mind paying the cost because compared to other places, the salad ingredients they use seem more fresh and crisp.  My go-to is the Cobb salad. It's made up of multiple different ingredients; the egg & chicken make it filling, the bacon gives it crunch, and the mad spice avocado makes it slightly spicy! Since I'm not a fan of blue cheese dressing, I get it with ranch instead. I sometimes substitute bacon for an equally crunch ingredient, croutons, and that tastes really good too. If you're a fan of extra kick in your salads then definitely ask them to mix yours up with some additional mad spice at the end!  The staff is always friendly and they make sure to ask at the beginning if you want to make any substitutions. They also carry Maine Root soda which to me is more delicious than traditional Coke & Pepsi drinks. I'll definitely be back and recommend this place to others. Can't wait for them to open up a location in Chandler!

I really wanted to love Ocotillo based on the pictures I saw posted & the reviews I read through. Unfortunately, for us that was not the case. We went in for my boyfriends birthday dinner and had even higher expectations for this reason. When we arrived, we were greeted and offered a seat in either the dining room, the bar area, or the heated patio. We opted for the dining room and were taken to our seats immediately. My first observation was that the seating was so close together on both sides of the table that even a normal sized person would have issues squeezing through to get to the booth seat! Also, while no body around us was talking loudly, their entire conversation could be heard simply based on the fact that they were so close to us. The restaurant itself was very loud which made it hard to have a conversation either way.  Our waiter came by soon after we were seated and took our drink and appetizer order. We got the fried zucchini first. When another waiter dropped it off at our table, he walked away so fast I couldn't even ask him for a couple of small plates so we could share, and we were also missing one set of silverware. It took a few minutes to track someone down to get what we needed. The dish itself, while it was decent, was definitely nothing to write home about. The biggest problem with it was that it was lacking salt! The burrata with the zucchini was an interesting combination and paired well with the spicy peppers & balsamic. I most likely would ask for it without mint ... and again, not to harp on this but I believe this would have been really tasty with a sprinkle of salt!  The orginal waiter came by as we were eating the appetizer to ask if we had decided on our main meals yet. It felt a bit rushed as he hadn't bothered coming by to check on us regarding the appetizer, but we ordered the Ocotillo Chicken & the Peking Duck. Even though it was busy, it didn't take too long for them to bring the food out. The plates looked absolutely beautiful when they were dropped off to us! The taste however ... I'd say it was interesting.  Firstly, the best thing at the table was the polenta that was underneath the duck. It was really creamy and tasty, I don't know how it was made but if I could just order a bowl of that, I would! I don't care for duck but did have a couple of bites and noticed it was well cooked & had a very crispy skin. It wasn't particularly flavorful though, so if you order this, make sure you like duck! My boyfriend said he's pretty much done with duck as it tastes really gamey.  Next, the chicken dish - my biggest complaint is that it was really hard to cut. For some reason, I was expecting that they'd just have chicken breasts a top the potato salad but this wasn't the case. The dish that the food was served in was so small it took a lot of effort to separate what I wanted to eat with the bones that I didn't. Another waiter noticed my struggle and brought a larger knife. Unfortunately, by that point, I was just done trying. The potato salad was yummy and tasted good with the au jus that was on the bottom. The chicken itself also had a really crispy skin like the duck, but didn't have much flavor.  Yet again, our waiter came by just to drop off the check. If the other components of the restaurant really wow'ed us, we would have consider coming back for a meal a different day. The service was really lacking and the prices of the dishes were really high (not worth it) so unfortunately, it was probably our first and last time at Ocotillo.

I stopped in at Fat Straw while walking around San Tan Village. It's normally really busy so I jumped at the chance when I saw only a couple of people already in line.  I got the Baby Fat Enchanted Tea with Vanilla Boba. I've never had Vanilla Boba before but it was good! .. Apparently they're one of the only stores that have it! The Enchanted Tea was nice too, sweet but not overly so.  The woman who rang up my order was really nice & it didn't take too long to get my order. I think it was a bit pricey as expected. I'd recommend checking them out if you're a fan of boba drinks!

I've seen a few of my friends check-in at The Soda Shop so I made the drive to get a treat on Saturday night. It's hidden in the parking lot, so it took a few minutes for me to find it, however I'm glad I did. It didn't take long to get through the quickly growing line; I ended up getting the Big Booty Judy - coke with raspberry, vanilla, and lime - and the frosted sugar cookie.  Mostly, my drink tasted like coke with lime & not the actual flavors so that was a bit disappointing, but I imagine if they had put any more of the syrups in, it would've gotten too sweet. The highlight of my order was the sugar cookie though. It was really soft and delicious, everything I look for in a good cookie!  There's a drive thru if you're in a rush & don't want to get out of the car. I'd definitely recommend swinging by if you're in the area!

A new addition on Mill Ave ... And a pretty good one, I'll say! The Corner Bakery has a variety of selections ranging from paninis (both for breakfast & lunch) & salads to pastas & soups. Both the times I've gone, I've had lunch sandwiches. The first time I tried the D.C chicken salad sandwich & the second time I got the Chicken Pomodori panini. I definitely preferred the panini.  They're pretty fast at getting orders out even during the busy lunch hours & the prices compared to other places like this (Panera, Paradise Bakery, etc.) are about the same.  Their bagels, cookies, & cakes always look really tempting ... Will be trying those at some point!

Habbouz, a quaint Tunisian restaurant, is to be found in a small parking lot in Phoenix. It's definitely worth the drive if you don't live close by! We were welcomed by the owners as soon as we walked in. Because we had never tried Tunisian food, we were really excited, and even more so after we got in! The owners were great about explaining the menu items and assured us that we'd be having a delicious meal. Being as hungry as we were, we got the Slata Mechouiya right away to start. It was a mixture of green peppers & tomatoes topped with olive oil which was to be eaten with their traditional bread. The closest thing I can think of to what it tastes like is maybe some sort of salsa but it's made with Tunisian spices, so it was very different. Very very good!  We put in our meal orders for the Ajja Merguez and the Chicken Mechoui. They cooked it all fresh, made to order, so it took a little bit of time to come out, however definitely worth the wait! The Ajja Merguez had homemade sausage which was different & more delicious than any sausage I've ever had and the sauce was PHENOMENAL! I would seriously ask for just that in a bowl, topped with a fried egg (which they had perfectly cooked by the way - runny in the middle) and the bread and be very very satisfied! I've never had this flavor before, but like I said, I'd get it all day long!  The Chicken Mechoui which was my dish was weird. There was just something off about the chicken that I couldn't place. It tasted burnt even though the chicken itself wasn't burnt and it was really dry. I did eat the couscous that was around it. I really wanted to get rice but was told the couscous would be worth the try so I went ahead with that. It was fluffy & soft and well flavored. Like I said before though, the chicken which should have been the highlight of the dish was a big disappointment, which is the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars.  I'd recommend getting the Slata Mechouiya & Ajja Merguez. You won't be disappointed! We'll be back!

I'm really excited to see that Waffle Love has a storefront now. It's so much easier to find than having to track down a food truck! Firstly, the ambiance here is great. It's not super big but still has quite a few tables and a high-top bar inside. The walls are adorned with artwork that almost just lifts your spirits! Very modern and trendy. Normally I tend to just put in take-out orders but here, I don't mind taking a seat to enjoy my waffle.  The waffles themselves are really good. My only note is - sometimes they're a bit inconsistent. I've gone in and received waffles that are light, fluffy, chewy, and a perfectly golden brown. Other times however, they get grilled too much and end up getting crunchy. Either way, I think Waffle Love makes the liege best waffles! My favorite one is the Cinna Love waffle which is a waffle topped with cinnamon butter & cream cheese frosting. Can't wait to go back at some point to try out the grilled cheese!

We finally got around to going to Chon after Jib invited me to dine there. We were greeted warmly upon arrival and offered a seat wherever we wanted. We settled in a cozy little booth and started looking over the menu.  Our waiter came over & suggested that we try out the Chicken Chon Thai Rolls while figuring out what we wanted for our meals. They were delivered to us in a very short while and we dug in right away. The rolls were super tasty, not quite like any other spring roll I've ever had before. The sweet & sour sauce was also really tasty - not too sweet like some sauces I've had at other places. I'd recommend getting these to start off your meal. I definitely want to try the Crab Delight next time too!  For our main meals, we got the Crispy Panang Chicken curry and the Chicken Pumpkin Curry.  The Panang curry was really good. It was served in a cup with rice, vegetables, & the crispy chicken on the side. While I liked everything on the plate and thought it was absolutely delicious, I missed the traditional way that Panang curry is served with everything mixed in so I'd probably get the non-crispy chicken kind next time. As far as the level of spice goes, I ordered medium & thought it had quite a bit of heat but like I mentioned, the sauce was absolutely delicious; I mixed the rice in there & enjoyed away.  The Chicken Pumpkin Curry was an absolute treat too! Neither me nor my boyfriend have had pumpkin curry before & we really enjoyed it. It was thick & creamy and very flavorful with vegetables along with pieces of pumpkin in it. Super tasty! We'd definitely recommend trying it out.  As soon as we were almost done eating, we were served the mango sticky rice for dessert. I've never had it before but it was good. I really like mangoes so I was all about that!  The service at the restaurant is great. Everyone is really friendly & they were really speedy in getting our meal items out, our check, etc. Definitely would recommend checking this place out!

I absolutely love Chinese food so I knew I had to try out Singing Pandas as soon as possible after I saw it come up on Yelp! The front parking lot was only about half full when we went there around 8pm (an hour before they closed) on a Friday but the restaurant was still really busy. We were greeted and taken to a table fairly quickly, and then given a couple of water cups and time to browse the menu.  My boyfriend got the Lucky Buddha beer to drink and the Mongolian Beef to eat, per recommendation of our waitress, and I got my usual pick at Chinese places, Kung Pao Chicken. We upgraded to egg fried rice for $1 extra each. It didn't take too long for the food to come and everything smelled so good! I had only a couple of bites of the Mongolian Beef but it was really tasty. The sauce was definitely the best part of the dish, and the beef was really well cooked. I thought it it tasted good with the onions and scallions. My boyfriend really enjoyed this dish. The Kung Pao chicken was good too with chopped onions, bell peppers, zucchini, and peanuts. It was only a little bit spicy and more so just really flavorful.  Both dishes had just the right amount of sauce to mix with the fried rice! Yum.  Looking around the restaurant, it seemed like there was a variety of dishes ordered. From everything I saw, it looked great and smelled even better! My only recommendation is: skip the fried rice. $1 isn't much but it wasn't worth the cost as it pretty much just tasted like white rice with a splash of soy sauce. Like I previously mentioned, the dishes had enough sauce so getting plain white rice would have been just fine.  The service was spot on throughout the time we were there. Our waitress as well as other waitresses came by to check on us a few times. I'll definitely be back to dine-in or grab a take-out order.

The struggle between keeping your new favorite dessert place a secret and posting a 5-star review on Yelp that it deserves! I choose the 5-star review! There have been so many photos of the cookie cup from Fatty Daddy's floating around Yelp, Instagram, & Facebook that I had to go in to try one as soon as possible.  First and foremost, their ice-cream! When we were there, we were told that they invent their own flavors and work with a local dairy to bring all their creations to life. This is why they have unique flavors like fruit loops, cap n crunch, blueberry muffin, Netflix & chill (popcorn flavored infused ice-cream with a bunch of stuff it), etc.  Next, the cookie cup! To make one, they take up to two ice-cream flavors of your choice and make a sandwich with a macaron. The flavors of the macarons vary but the time we went they had fruity pebbles, red velvet, and vanilla. They also toast up a marshmallow right in front of you and add any toppings to the cup that you may want!  My order was for a fruity pebbles macaron with blueberry muffin ice-cream and a toasted marshmallow. The best part about this whole dessert was that everything was put together in layers so there were bits of all three parts in every bite! The macaron was soft and chewy with a smooth outer shell, the blueberry muffin ice-cream was packed with delicious blueberry flavor, and the toasted marshmallow added another unique layer of flavor with a gooey texture. Yum!!  Lastly, the service was spot on! We were welcomed in right when we walked in and offered samples of ice-cream. They were great in making recommendations and were happy to give us the time we needed to make a decision even as it was getting busy. I can't wait for the next time to get another cookie cup!

Such a cute & perfect new addition to downtown Chandler, and people have definitely gotten word of it! I was having a night to myself on a Friday so I thought I'd go by and grab a quick treat. Definitely got a treat, but by no means was it quick. I arrived around 8:00pm and there was a super long line out the door at Ice Cream Sammies. I snagged a parking spot close by and decided that it would be worth the wait.  Probably about 25-ish minutes later I was at the point in line where I could place my order. The delicious aroma of cookies had been lingering in the air outside for so long that I couldn't go without ordering their traditional ice cream sammie! Chocolate chip cookie on bottom, snickerdoodle cookie on top (which I wasn't planning to get until I heard someone while waiting in line say that it's delicious), some cookie butter ice-cream in the middle (after a sample to make sure I liked it), and some chopped peanuts/walnuts on the edge!  I was satisfied with what I got. The chocolate chip cookie edged out the snickerdoodle cookie by just a just a little bit for me; it had a much crunchier outside & a softer middle, and was a little bit tastier than the other one, so I'd just get that one next time! And let me just say one thing about that cookie butter ice cream. YES! I'd go in to get just get a triple scoop of that all day, everyday. Yum!  This place is definitely on my list places to return to!

I have not had Korean food before but the food we had at Koreatown was amazing, and paired with the service, it was definitely a 5-star experience! My fiancé & I had gotten here at 7:30p on Saturday night. There was no wait time, but most of the tables around us were full. We were greeted immediately, seated, and given a chance to look over the menu. Our server came by and asked if we had ever been to Koreatown. After we let him know that we had not and that we had actually never had Korean food either, he gave us a quick run-down of the menu.  I had seen multiple photos from my Yelp friends of the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi so I ordered that and upon inquiring if it was very spicy our server suggested getting it medium-spicy, so I agreed. My fiancé got the Bulgogi Hot Stone per recommendation of our server.  The small dishes that we were given to try out while we waited were very interesting. I didn't realize all the items were served cold but they included kimchi, pickled radishes, zucchini, sprouts, fish cakes, broccoli, potatoes, and squid. I liked the kimchi, zucchini, and sprouts, the other items were also okay.  When our food was delivered to us, both of the dishes were sizzling and smelled phenomenal! The Chicken Bulgogi dish quickly became one of my favorites after only a couple of bites! The sauce had a very unique flavor and tasted great in combination with the caramelized onions and the side of rice. I think that medium spice was perfect for me just because I don't eat super spicy food, but I could myself enjoying it with the normal amount of spice as well just because the sauce seemed a bit on the sweeter side. The hot stone was different in that the rice was served on the bottom (instead of on the side) with meat, veggies, and an egg on top, but sauce on the side. Our server told my fiancé that he would recommend adding as much sauce as he wanted into the pot, mixing the contents together, and waiting just a couple of minutes so that the heat from the stone would complete cooking the egg. My fiancé really enjoyed his dish as well and commented that in this case, more sauce was better.  The portion size of the Korean BBQ was big enough for two to share, but we liked trying two dishes out and taking some leftovers home. If I had to make a recommendation, I would probably suggest getting the Korean BBQ style over the hot stone only because the stone was so hot that it kept cooking the items. The flavors were so good in both however, that it really is personal preference.  Our server, as previously mentioned, was really helpful and came by to ask if we we needed anything a couple of times. He was prompt in taking our order, bringing us the check, and so forth, as well. Definitely a 5-star place in my book, I will be back!

A new Thai restaurant option in Tempe! Love it. I've been by Smile Lao Thai a few times now and had pretty good experiences as far as the food goes. The first time we went, it was for dine-in and the next couple of times, we just got an order to go.  My fiancé dined with me the first time. He got an order of the Avocado Curry and I got an order of the Pad Pet with chicken. Our server told us that their spice levels are more spicy than at other Thai restaurants, so I ended up getting a 1 on a scale of 0-5 with 5 being the most spicy, and my fiancé got his dish at a level 2. It didn't take too long for the food to come out and both dishes smelled phenomenal! Even at level 1, the Pad Pet was pretty spicy. I liked it because the vegetables were fresh and crunchy, and the sauce was flavorful. The Avocado Curry was by far the star of the meal though! The curry itself was thick and creamy, and texture of the whole dish was even more creamy with the fresh pieces of avocado in it. It still had some crunch, however to offset the soft texture with bell peppers and green beans. Spice level 2 was away too spicy for me, and even my fiancé who doesn't mind spicy food thought it was a bit much.  I couldn't get enough of the delicious avocado curry which is why I have gone back a couple of times just to get that! Unlike the first time we dined in, our to-go order have always come with a side salad. We noticed the menu says all entrées are served with one, but I'm not sure why we weren't given salads when we at the restaurant. Additionally, the sides of rice which came with the to-go orders have also been much larger. I think I got more rice for my own entrée than my fiancé and I did for our two entrées combined when we were there! I'm not sure if they charge for an extra side of rice if we ask for more than what is initially served to us, but I imagine they would.  This is why, overall, I'm going to go with a 4-star review. I know the restaurant is still new, so maybe they're just working out some service inconsistencies, but as mentioned before, the food has been consistently really good. We'll be back to give them a try again for dine-in.

New favorite ice-cream place, and by far one of the most unique places I've seen in the valley! I had bookmarked Nomadic Ice Cream Rolls months ago when I first saw Grace R.'s review of it. It was quite a hike to get there, but we were running errands close by, and it was only 10 or so minutes out of the way. Hot summer day in Phoenix, we figured we would stop in!  After a quick browse of the menu, I ended up choosing the Fox! Do a Berry Roll! which was hand-made right in front of us. Our chosen base (strawberry) was mixed with the fruits of our choice (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries), topped with strawberry syrup & nuts, rolled up, and voila, all ready to enjoy. They offered a small size which had 4 rolls and a large size which had 5 rolls. We ordered the small but really wished we would have gotten the large for two to share!  The strawberry ice-cream base itself wasn't very sweet, but was pretty rich, and the berries were a little bit tart. I liked how they balanced out with the strawberry syrup as that was the perfect addition for some sweetness, along with the nuts for some crunch, and whipped cream just because! Each bite packed lots of flavor.  I know it's a cliché statement, but there really is something for everyone here! The other option which caught my eye was the banana cream pie, but basically, you can custom-order pretty much whatever you want. They have a chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, or green tea ice cream base along with a few different fruit options, cookies, syrups, nuts, sprinkles, whipped cream; I also saw nutella, marshmallow fluff, different candies, and so-forth. Honestly, there really was a very large variety!  The owner told us that he runs everything! He used to be firefighter but after an injury, he was looking for something else to do. When he saw a youtube video of someone making ice-cream rolls, he figured he would bring this concept to the valley. So glad he did because for us, this was a complete hit!

I love ice cream so of course I had to go to Creamistry as soon as possible when I saw it come up in Scottsdale! We went on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy, however there wasn't a line to order. We looked over the extensive menu that was divided by flavor & toppings and their pre-made creations. There was an additional board on the side which had their popular picks which definitely helped me narrow down the selections!  I ended up ordering one of the options listed amongst the popular picks: cookie butter ice cream with marshmallow cream sauce in a waffle bowl. My fiancé decided to get the cookies and cream ice cream in a brownie bowl.  We both agreed that the cookie butter ice cream tasted much better than the cookies and cream ice cream. The cookies and cream had way too many cookies, and the little bit of ice cream that was there was almost icy. The cookie butter ice cream on the other hand was rich and super creamy. I smashed the waffle crisp into the ice cream which added little bits of crunch to every bite. I enjoyed it thoroughly!  The shop itself was very loud, probably due to it being a weekend. Their ice cream was definitely not inexpensive & it was a bit much for $1 per topping in my opinion, however the experience was fun as we got to watch them make the ice cream with the liquid nitrogen. I'm not sure if this is somewhere we will be returning to frequently, however I would be willing to stop by if I was in the area!

Thank you Hailey for putting together this Yelp Elite Event & Sauce for having us!  Sam & Hailey started off the evening by letting us know a little bit more about the restaurant. I've dined at another Sauce before but didn't realize they get a lot of their ingredients from local businesses ... that's always great to hear!  There was a huge spread of food for us, all served up family style. I was so full by the end as we got to try out their bruschetta, salads, pizzas, pastas, and some pizza cookies with gelato. My favorites were the Caprese bruschetta, Watermelon & Arugula salad, and Pizza Cookie.  The bruschetta was made with really soft & fluffy bread, had a tasty pesto spread, and was topped with a light balsamic drizzle. The flavor combinations were so good, I couldn't stop eating one bite after the other!  While the other two salads were really good, and the one with garbanzo beans especially, was really unique, the reason why I liked the Watermelon & Arugula best was because of the fresh pieces of watermelon and also the delicious dressing! It was the perfect summer salad.  Lastly, you pretty much can't go wrong with pizza cookies anywhere, but the dessert at Sauce seemed extra delicious because of the gelato! I didn't get a chance to snag a taste of the peanut butter gelato but I heard people really enjoyed it.  I know I'll for sure be back to get those dishes! It was great seeing everyone for a fun, casual evening out before the weekend!
