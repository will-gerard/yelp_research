Waste of money. Waste of time. After 2 hours and $40 had to tell the guy how to clean my vehicle. Didn't even vacuum interior completely. 2 of 4 tires not even cleaned.  What a joke. Cust svc is trash.

Sydney always does an awesome job.   She has been cutting my hair for over 5 years.  New facility that is spotless in an easy to reach location.

Sydney has been doing a great job for many years.  Top notch establishment.  Great service, great prices, even a membership plan.  Why would you go anywhere else?
