My friend brought me here and we had an amazing Bloody Mary and the Hoppy B*tch IPA. We also had the Kale and orange bread which was great as well. Chris and Jessica gave us great service! I definitely recommend this place and will be back soon. Good food and drinks!

Worst place to ever bring your car. I didn't even have to pay because it was going through insurance of the person who hit my car and I still will never bring a car to this shop. Cynthia at front desk has biggest attitude and could care less about the customer. My advisor was Jerry Sr. And he was horrible and I had to do His job for him, the manager was even worse also named Jerry. Biggest advice don't bring your car here if you want to be treated horrible and they like to add on more to what's wrong with your car then it actually is.

I love this Gold's, always clean and never too packed. People don't stare and hang out like they do at LA fitness. Personal trainers know what they are doing (Matt R.) Staff is always friendly. Get the $40 membership it is worth the parking and towel service!

I live right around the corner from this place and it is amazing! The menu is simple and everything is very good. They also do specials daily and change it up. I love that they are open late and that the kitchen stays open.   The owners are so genuine and friendly, they offer great service and it feels like you are in Italy when you are here.  The pizza definitely competes with all other local pizza restaurants in Phoenix. We will definitely be back!
