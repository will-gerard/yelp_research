Where do I start.  The lady at the front end is not very friendly.  The whole car wash machine is so old (the employees told me) it breaks very often. So often that it broke right when I was in the middle of the drive-thru car wash machine.  Waited 15-20min before the thing started rolling again. It never really did, I had to actually drive thru it with out having the whole soap and other chemicals applied to my tires, etc.  I had to wait outside next to my car to be finished cause no one ever told me what to do or where to wait for my car.  This was my second attempt to use this place, the first one the person at the from was so rude that I didn't even tried the service.  No surprise here but the only ones doing their job were the people drying and finishing my car. They never stopped moving.  StarWash is sooooo much better in all areas, even on prices. I would not return to this place.

Love this place. Love the guy, he is super friendly and love the food (for what it costs .. 3 huge tacos for $6 even, including tax).  Yes, the chicken could be a little spicier or red or something but it's not bad at all.   Tacos come with your favorite meat, beans, onions, chopped cabbage and tomato and melted cheddar cheese. Tacos come (VERY IMPORTANT) individually wrapped in a piece of foil with a (very important too) a fresh and green (not old and brown) wedge of lime.  I like each taco wrapped individually in a piece of foil because otherwise they will get very messy and wet like those tacos at Chipotle restaurant, I love them but I hate the wet messy tacos Chipotle has).  Any way, tacos come inside a paper brown bag packed with two different salsas on the side (red and green).   This place has a fabulous outdoor and sadly dusty patio where you can eat your tacos. Imagining yourself sitting in some place in Puerto Vallarta with an ocean view, except, of course, the view here is Camelback Rd.   They also have dozens of magazines for you to read while waiting/eating your food. I should also point out those magazines are current and not from 1985. I sat next to a Architectural Digest magazine and it's the same issue currently sold at the store right now.   The only downside of this place is that they do not offer fountain drinks. You must buy a 12oz can of soda or beer.   If you are a pro like me, you stop at QuikTrip or McDonalds first to buy a large size soda before coming to this place.  You can also follow me on twitter @RexCota :)

Who ever is the owner of this franchise doesn't realize or care that this place is very very SMOKEY all the time!!! Vents don't work, fix it!!!  Is this a health hazard? That's my question. Employees breath this all the time, every day, for many hrs at a time.  Just saying.

This place is the opposite of fast food drive thru restaurant. The food is good thought but everything else EVERYTHING ELSE! sucks here, including the furniture and lousy employees. Are they even food handler certified? This place manager or owner needs to take note of how slow they are to serve you the food.  They have no idea of what a fast food restaurant is. None! 2 stars because if the good food.

Star CarWash definitely has better drying system. My front and back windows with really bad job when you buy ANY of the washes.  Good vacuums hoses. Good and nice shade for you to dry your car.  There is a tiny tiny zinc to wash your hands? I guess.  They sell microfiber rag for $2 because this place doesn't include a rag with any of your washes.  Over all, I recommend to go to StarWash c Car Wash if you are picky and just drive away with out drying your car yourself.  CLEANFREAK you must get off and dry the windows yourself.  I would love to see a place where you can wash your mats with a hose and brush.  This place offers wonderful monthly packages but their poor job didn't convince me to get on.  They have packs for $3,5,8 bucks. Get the $5 cause $8 pack doesn't seem to have any difference.  I bought one at Star CarWash but expired and I was very pleased.  Employees here are very helpful and professional.  For an emergency this place is ok.

$14 for 2 tacos :O VERY GOOD FOOD, LOVE IT!! EXPENSIVE!  VERY DIRTY GLASS DOOR (all the time, I come here often)(stupid people pushing the glass instead of the metal bar to open door) Flour tortillas are always a bit salty. Always. Sometimes way to salty. Whoever is monitoring the quality and taste of the food is *cough* not doing his job*cough*.   With this prices they should DEFIANTLY hire someone to exclusively clean the floors, glass doors, wipe tables and empty those trash bins...I haven't been in the restroom but I'm almost sure is a disaster as well.   Everything costs "extra" here geez!!  Overall: -good food -needs to improve in clearness (a lot). -kitchen guys could drop the "I'm cool at my school" attitude and be more professional in customer service and handling the food, which leads me to think if they even passed their pro handling food test by the City.  $14 for 2 tacos :O http://imgur.com/w1QxktI
