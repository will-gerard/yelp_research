i can see why this place is popular. it's definitely hip and in a cool location. their coffee and their service have only been mediocre in my experiences, however. bitter shots and huge bubbles in the milk. even though the place is well known, you can probably find better quality and less of a pretentious atmosphere elsewhere.

copper star has a special place in my heart for sure. the atmosphere is perfect for a small meeting or for reading or studying. it is also very cool inside and is located in an area great for thrifting.   the coffee itself is good. their milk steaming ability isn't excellent, but they pull consistent shots. their chai is great and their sesame ginger tuna sandwich is actually outstanding.   since its opening, i have probably visited copper star more frequently than any other coffee shop in phoenix.

best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood.   i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.  the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.

i love the roosevelt district. i didn't realize that there would be a little boutique inside the coffee shop (and a library too)! they were awesome. great shots, great milk, cool area, friendly service, really neat selection of local artists' stuff for sale.  if you are visiting from out of town or are looking for a place to bring out of town visitors, conspire is definitely particular to phoenix (in the best way).

many delicious options, very flavorful. They were sweet about helping me concoct a vegan option. You can taste the blessing. They also have good vegetarian options, no concocting necessary.

I go here regularly because they make the best Ethiopian food I have ever had and because the people who work at Gojo are super genuine and kind. The vegetarian options are consistently awesome. The atmosphere is great and would be good for a party, a meeting, a show, or anything. Even has a good spiritual vibe, long may Ethiopia reign with peace, justice & love. I recommend Gojo and the Ethiopian cafe in the same plaza to everyone.
