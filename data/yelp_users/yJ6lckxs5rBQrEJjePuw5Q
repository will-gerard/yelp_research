I love Barro's Pizza. Their wings are great but this location has let me down time and time again. This time however, it went too far. I got food poisoning that lasted 3 days. The first night we ordered wings, and two pizzas for the family and enough for leftovers.  The first night I didn't eat the one that had meatball on it. The second day however, I did and for 3 days I had terrible stomach pains and endless trips to the bathroom.   This location is the worst, the employees don't care enough for their customers and the inside of the place is too small for the employees to take on the load they do.

Much like a lot of reviewers on here, this place isn't the best. I can make better homemade pizza with the cheapest of ingredients.   Our order was for pepperoni, pepperoni and olive, and their white pizza. The pepperoni was very greasy yet on the bottom of the crust was layered with flour. The white pizza was the worst. I'm not sure why it tasted sweet but it had a strange sweet flavor to it. It seems that no matter what it takes an hour to get your order, yet about an hour and 15 mins seems to be the actual estimate.  My kids love pizza, neither of them would eat it. All kids should love pizza. :(

Never. Over priced salt lick with an autistic staff.

Lousy service. Messed my order for the 4th time now. This place sucks bad, they used to be good.

I'm not sure why this place is rated so high.  As a test, go to Panda Express and this place, order the orange chicken and have someone taste them both. You will see that there isn't a difference in the taste.  I expected more from this place but the food is just your basic frozen food cooked in a wok...or microwave. I will say that my wife the lemon chicken and it tasted like it was cooked, left out, and then reheated, you know it had that "reheated" taste.  Unless the reheated taste is just the taste of the food and in that case it's just bad.  The service I guess was nice. 4 people on staff at the time, all were standing around talking. One guy was standing in front of the register playing jewel craft and he didn't acknowledge I was there. A girl took my order after shooing the guy away so she could enter my order in the register.  We also got pot stickers and they tasted like chemicals found in cleaning solution. My only guess for this was that they were sprayed on accident when someone was cleaning but it ruined them. They were also still raw and very under cooked. One was still cold in the middle.  If you want really good Chinese food, I suggest going to China Palace instead. They are always nice and helpful. I like their orange, sesame, and lemon chicken and it has a nice crispy taste to it, not soggy like Tott's.  Overall, if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you.

I like a lot of their subs but their steak and cheese is the closest you can get to a Philly cheesesteak. I change my order on this one, extra meat, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and no sauce. Makes it a perfect Philly cheesesteak.

Not the best Italian I ate, which would have gotten a 3. But I got sick. Some of it was over cooked and I think they mixed old food with new because some was cold.

The use of overpriced frozen foods is outrageous. I had tried the calamari and noticed right away that there was two types of it on the plate. One that looked dark and old and the other looked freshly cooked but more like it came from a frozen bag. After eating it, the texture was completely different between the two.  I couldn't finish anything else. After diner though came the worse part as my wife and I were to watch a movie at the theater nearby but half way through the movie I felt sick and found myself throwing up. Wife and I had to leave the movies early, we don't get to go out often, but this was a horrible time cause by this restaurant.

I had written a bad review about the this place not long ago and they were happy to give me another shot at eating at the place and paying for my meal. I'm glad they were willing to allow me to have another chance at it. However, though it wasn't as bad as last time I ate here they food hasn't much improved. I ordered the same meal, the Buca Trio Platter. I was a little hesitant to order the same thing that made me sick before but they were assuring me it was going to be good.  I the mozzarella triangles aren't bad for frozen food. The stuffed mushrooms weren't as wet as last time but this time my biggest issue was the calamari. Last time I ate it, it made me sick, and had food poisoning. This time around, wasn't much better. It didn't make me sick but half of it was cold and the other half was hot. This tells me that they were cooked at different times.  I'm sorry to staff at Bucca but I still give it one star as the food was not good and the chefs must not care about the quality of their food.

I have ordered from here 3 times so far and every single time it is just the best tasting pizza delivery I have had. Even the garlic knots, the cheese bread, wings, it's all so good.

Worst place ever. The employees refused to actually make the food. Then she flirted with the cook for 10 mins while I waited for my change.

I'm upset with this place. I've been to 3 other In and Outs and I don't care for this one. There have been several times that we got pink meat in the burgers. I mean completely pink. It's overly greasy and dripping with the liquid fat. If you like In and Out there are better ones and if I compared this place to 5 Guys, 5 Guys wins hands down.

Service was nice and helpful. Food was outstanding. I usually can't stand Italian food as much of the places seem to take frozen foods, throw it in a pan and serve it. This place was a fantastic treat to Italian food. The greatest place I have been in a very long time.

Everyone is always so unhappy here. Seems like everyone hates it when you order a doughnut.

Coffee wasn't that good, very cheap tasting. The biscuits were dry and my weren't cooked to my order. The gravy was flavorless and bacon undercooked. Maybe I had a bad chef that day but damn, was not worth it.
