This is a little "hole in the wall" gem in Tempe. We eat here about twice a month and I never leave disappointed. Not fancy, but fun atmosphere. They have cool things to look at in the market. I always enjoy taking people here for the first time. If your in the area, check it out !

I have been coming here since I was a little kid. Everything I have ever tried was great. Would highly recommend trying it out. Great hot sauce although don't eat a whole bottle because you will pay for it later !

This place did not seem clean and smelled like moldy towel. I don't think there is much more to say about that

Food is good although they are always trying to rush me through and keep trying to wrap up my burrito before I'm done adding stuff.  It's like they don't want me to see everything I can add to my burrito. Also last time I put lettuce in my burrito so they would not give me any on the side ... Wtf ?   I would strongly advise them on getting a salsa bar, that would be a deal breaker for me. I will not be returning unless it's heavily discounted or they add a salsa bar.   Over all food is decent although every time I go there somehow they piss me off which is rare for a restaurant to do.
