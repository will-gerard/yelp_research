There's a few trendy doughnut shops opening up around the city. Those are great, but I prefer Rainbow! The doughnuts really remind me of a doughnut shop from my childhood. We'd wake up early on Sundays for church and as a reward, we'd get to eat sugary doughnuts after. But that's besides the matter.   THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! They've got tons of yummy options. Doughnuts if you want something sweet and croissant-wiches if you are partial to more savory options. So far, I've only had the doughnuts. Dough is perfect, icing is just sweet enough. My go to is a chocolate glaze, but I've ventured out to try other flavors. Recently, I tried the milk and cereal doughnut (which I loved) and the orange glaze (surprising, refreshing, but not really my preference).   The prices are really great too. Cheap but not like they're just giving away food, like a local doughnut shop should be. I don't leave with three or four doughnuts and coffee wondering what I just spend my $20 on like I've done at some of the trendy doughnut shops in town ( I'm definitely not ragging on them. They're good and their designs are awesome, I just like Rainbow better).   My best advice is to go here early, or on a weekday, but still morning. They tend to run out of the more popular doughnuts towards midday.

I love it here! I did a lot of Bikram growing up and through high school but then went to college and never had the discretionary income to get back to it, but then I saw the Groupon. I couldn't turn down the deal!   It's the first Bikram studio I've been to (or heard of) since relocating to Phoenix, so I only have studios in San Francisco, CA to compare this one too. It's just really great here! I actually feel like the teachers care about my well being. Instructors walk around during class and pay attention to the students, while still keeping the class challenged and motivated. Most other studios I've been to, the instructor sits up on a box the entire time reciting things, barely looking around or concerned with anything else but what he or she needed to say within the 90 minutes.   From the minute I walk in to the minute I leave, everyone is super friendly and helpful. The studio isn't too smelly either and is well kept. I was scared to go in after reading some of the reviews but it is far from awful compared to other studios I have been too. The scheduling of their classes is great too! One that can fit into anyone's schedule but more, one where students are stepping all over each other on their way in and out. There's definitely time to settle into class and time to linger in sivasana after.    Another plus is that they offer a multitude of classes. They have traditional Bikram but also Vinyasa, Yin, Restorative, Sound Vibration and more! Now, I sound like I'm advertising, but I swear I'm not. It's just an all around great place! Try it!!

I chose this place because it was really close to my new residence in Phoenix and with a ton of relocation costs, I had little money I wanted to spend on maintaining the look of my car. With the word "carousel" in the name, I thought, "Interesting idea." With the word, "family," I thought, "Can't be too bad." I hadn't looked at the Yelp reviews for this place, but immediately regretted it.     From the minute I drove in to the minute I exited the place, I felt REALLY REALLY uncomfortable. Sometimes, I wonder why I didn't just back my car up and take off. "High temperatures, dumb choices," I keep telling myself. Going on, I was greeted (kind of) by a man with a clipboard and a bunch of choices. I had a bunch of questions, as the sheet he gave me seemed incomplete but every time I asked a question, the guy was completely distracted by whatever his fellow coworkers were doing on the other side of my car. I brushed it off, found the good person in myself, and just made a choice. After making a decision I was immediately KICKED OUT OF MY OWN CAR not really sure where I should pay or what I should do. Finally, another customer recognized my, "deer in the headlights," look and told me there was a lobby inside. As I walked in, I could hear the employees making those sounds men make when they want your attention on the street. (What kinds of women respond to this anyway? I was fully clothed, not wearing anything scandalous, mind you.) This is where I almost lost it. Really, is this a professional business?   I walked in to the lobby thinking I may never see my car again (what we should think at a car wash, right?) and was greeted by a bunch of uncomfortable stares. I keep thinking back to this experience wondering if there was anything wrong with the way I looked resulting in these stares but can not think of anything out of the norm. Again, I was helped by another customer, telling me where I should pay. So I pay, no problem there. The guy even gives me a student discount after I noticed they honor them. I turn to my right and see that my car had just come out of the washing area. I followed it outside, where, again, I was greeted with more uncomfortable stares and one employee telling me that, "your car smells like bud." What? Bud?...Marijuana? Ok, I'm from California, so we use that word pretty loosely but that's definitely not a FAMILY word, nor was it very professional to say that. (I've had friend smoking cigarettes in my car awhile back in college, but never marijuana, if you were wondering. )   In the drying station, yes, more uncomfortable stares, only to be alleviated once, by another customer who brought a very expensive luxury car to get cleaned. When this happened, the employees all started whoop hollering and praising the car. I was thankful for that, but I'm pretty sure the owner of the car was not ( but I don't know, do you buy luxury cars to be noticed?)   When they were close to being done with my car, one of the employees asked if I could remove stuff from the cup holder so he could clean that area. I politely declined, because I was more than ready to get out of the place. I also feel incredibly bad that I didn't tip, but should I have?   Never going back again.   Advice for people debating going here: Don't go here. Spend a little more. Go somewhere with customer service and professional value.

This place is a little hard to locate, but totally worth searching for! It's tucked away in the little plaza that appears to have a few big stores that have closed and behind a busy Filiberto's so it's easy to miss.   I was actually kind of scared of what I was walking into since the outside seemed a little run down but I had read the reviews online and saw that they were mostly praise for the business.   When I walked in, there were a couple ladies getting manicures and pedicures. The lady upfront, also working on a manicure, asked me what service I needed as she continued working on her customer's nails. I wanted an eyebrow wax. She (who I later found out was Suzy, the lady everyone raves about in their reviews) politely told her customer my eyebrow wax would only take a few minutes and then got up to help me right away. At first, I thought this was a little weird and rude, but it was pretty helpful to me. Otherwise, I would've waited there for another thirty minutes for a wax that takes about ten minutes.    We go into the wax room and waxing goes as usual. The wax was the perfect temperature and Suzy was very polite, funny (she thought I was getting ready for prom. I graduated high school almost ten years ago), and worked super swiftly. My eyebrow wax was done in a jiff!   After admiring my newly shaped eyebrows in the mirror, we walked back up front so I could pay. And guess what?! Their prices are great! I'll definitely be back!

Hands down, the best bowling alley in the Scottsdale area!   I used to live in close proximity to Brunswick Via Linda, but now, even though I'm about a 30 minute drive away (and shamefully, kind of a downtown Phoenix city snob) I'm still willing to make the trip! That's saying alot if you know me.   Lane conditions are great! Food and drink selection is great (make sure to order the soft pretzels with cheese)! Clientele is never sketchy/weird/off/waiting for you to bowl so they can run away with your belongings type people. It doesn't feel like drug deals are being made in and around the property. Deals and prices are amazing! And the staff...OMG they are SO HELPFUL!   At most bowling alleys I feel like most of the staff hates their lives, but that's not the case here. Everyone is excited about bowling, the music they're playing and the deals they're offering. Scott is the man you want to talk to, but if he's not around or busy, everyone is just as excited, helpful and willing to steer you in the right direction! I go here quite often so this is definitely not a one experience Yelp. This place never fails!

Soooo yummy! I'm a current San Francisco expat who is frequently searching for unique flavors and textures of food I frequent at home so finding this place was quite a huge moment.   We went in on a weekday night so it wasn't busy at all. Everyone greeted us and asked if we needed any water or menu explanations. Super helpful and welcoming!   Since there was 4 of us, we decided to go for a combination platter, said to feed three and then one entree platter, said to feed one. When the food came, we were so surprised by the portions! Our order could have easily fed 6-7 people! I've never seen Ethiopian food portions so huge, and I've been to multiple Ethiopian restaurants.   What impressed me even more was that the servers were so excited to share what each part of the dish was, how it was made, what was in it etc. I love being able to go to places where the staff is really passionate about their product. It really shines through along with great customer service. Even if the food was awful (which it was far from), I would have still had a great experience here!  Overall, amazing, flavorful food and wonderful customer service.

Even though I had to give this place a few tries, I really do love it! I just needed to get over the whirlwind of what happens after I walk in until the point at which I get my order. I can never tell if people are in line, looking at the HUGE display of tasty pastries, or waiting for their drink. There is often so much going on in the small ordering area but after a few visits, I see it more as a small space that builds connections/community.   Normally, I order a regular black coffee or iced coffee. It's good here, but what really shines for them are their espresso drinks! The black and white, the caramel, the velvet...all sooooo good! They have alot of different choices too so make sure not to miss their menu board, which, unfortunately is kind of easy to miss. Don't be shy, just ask! It's easy to get scooted quickly in and out of the ordering mix, but just be confident. Everyone's super nice and willing to help!   The atmosphere is really hip and trendy too, so make sure to order your drink to enjoy on the premise. Enjoy your drink with friends, or a really good book, or meet someone new!

I love it here! I really do. I enjoy walking around looking at their well stocked items, the amazing, always filled display of fruits and vegetables, scooping bulk items into a bag to be purchases....I could go on forever, but I think you get the picture. Normally, I hate grocery shopping but Sprouts makes the experience very likeable.   Their staff is super helpful, always willing to point me in the right direction when I'm searching for something. They're very nice too! No complaints there.   It isn't until I get to check out that I have the problem (and maybe I'm making this a bigger deal than it is). I bring my own bags, which sometimes I think i get a discount for? It's like a nickel, so no biggie there but the baggers! THE GROCERY BAGGERS! They must learn how to pack bags. Bread on the bottom? Underneath milk, apples, bananas and other produce? Really? Dumping all my items into the bag without a care?!   Sometimes I ask if certain items can be on top, which the employee usually politely obliges but I feel awful getting mad at the employees so I usually dump my entire bag out in my trunk and pack it myself. Sometimes the employees see and I still feel awful, but that's a personal matter.   Love this store but sometimes I'd rather pack my bags myself.

My food was extremely spicy so I couldn't tell you if it was delicious or not. It was just extremely spicy! But that's my preference, of course. I understand some people love the spice. Before that, our server brought out chips, salsa and a bean dip. That was really good and unique since most restaurants usually just serve salsa. We ordered a round of margaritas too. Which were basically all tequila. WIN.   This place is definitely your standard mall Mexican restaurant. Really great prices! Be sure to go during happy hour, even greater prices! It's a really good family restaurant too. So if you're at Arizona Mills and looking for a place you and you're family can sit and eat, away from the standard food court, try this place. The servers are nice and super helpful despite the fact that it seemed like they were a little under staffed the day I went. Good place! I'd try it again!

I decided to go for lunch since I saw they had pretty good lunch plate deals ($7-10 for a basic lunch plate). It was around 1pm and pretty busy, full of people that work in the surrounding area, I assume. I was quickly given a table, and then quickly rushed into ordering.   I went with Number 13, Panang Curry. It came with salad and a veggie egg roll. It's a great deal if you just want to fill your stomach, not really caring about quality or taste. Everything seemed a little watered down. For example, the sauce that comes for the egg roll seems like they added water, or a simple syrup type thing. The curry it self wasn't very tasty, just heavily spiced.   Everything was just kind of disappointing. I did like that my water glass was pretty much always full, but that was the best part.

Their coffee is ok but I really wanted to highlight the idea of the shared workspace here. A coffee shop, art gallery, and Bison leather. More places need to do this in Phoenix. SOOO COOL!  It does serve as a really great local coffee house and definitely more relaxed than ones close by. I live in the neighborhood, so I'll frequent the place on my off days to sit and read, or just sit with a drink and relax. If you're looking for a quieter place to study or be, this place is definitely it!

This place is so great! It was past noon on a Saturday and my friend and I were looking for somewhere to have breakfast for lunch. Most of our go-tos stop serving breakfast around 1-2pm and we didn't really want to be, "those customers." So we Yelped some options.   Daily Dose was one of the first to come up in the area and wow, served breakfast until 4pm on weekends! So we went.   I was so surprised when we walked in. There are indoor and outdoor seating sections, really friendly staff, and wow (again) so many options on the menu! We started by each ordering a bloody mary and then proceeded to take forever to choose from the many options. Again, I am soooo glad they serve breakfast later, as there never felt as if there was a rush for us to order. I finally decided on a Belgian waffle which turned out amazing. Upon receiving our check, prices were great too. Really awesome place.   I will definitely be back here! So many, "wows!"

I live pretty close by so I'm not sure why I didn't try this place sooner! We went on a Saturday afternoon so it was quite busy but not so much that it felt uncomfortable in there.   First, the place is much bigger than I had initially expected and very very good for large groups (I know where I'm having my next birthday!). They offer, I think it was almost 30 at the time, beer choices. I went with a flight so I could try a few different ones I'd been eyeing. They all tasted great but I don't drink quite enough beer that I could really say I knew exactly what I was drinking. Along with the flight, I ordered, "The Mess," which is essentially poutine. It was soooo good! The fries were crunchy, the gravy was stewy, the cheese curds squeaky! Although I made it my meal, it can definitely be shared amongst the table. Also at the table were the well talked about spam sliders and grilled cheese sandwich. All good choices!   Overall, a great experience! I can't wait to come back for a TV dinner Tuesday, another new beer, or a pop tart!

I really really recommend this place! I took a friend from out of town here, and since then have gone back quite a few times.   First, the design of the restaurant really works for them. I feel like so many restaurants are attempting to go for that, "simple industrial," look these days and Pig & Pickle has really pulled it off well. They've created such a cool and trendy atmosphere with a menu that goes along with it.   There are so many unique foods to choose from on the menu and from my understanding, the menu changes frequently (which I love, personally). If it's available during the time you're there, I definitely recommend the udon noodles, bone marrow, foie gras, and roasted corn. Share amongst your table! The portions aren't big, but they're packed with flavor! (And definitely balanced, like the mission statement claims.)   Their drink menu is a total win too! I've never ordered anything I didn't like. For those that don't/can't drink alcohol, THEY HAVE COCA LIGHT. OMG LIKE WHAT?!?! and an array of really great soda pops. For those that choose an alcoholic beverage, their menu is endless and amazing! #scottsdaleproblems is my go to, but you really can't go wrong with any of the drinks they offer!   As far a price point, a little pricey, but definitely a stand out in the sea of Scottsdale restaurants! Go here!

Call me a woman of simple taste, but their coconut rice topped with black beans is a total surprise party with glitter bombs all over my tastebuds! It came as a side with one of their fish taco choices. The fish tacos were as expected but really the coconut rice and black beans should be a main dish. Like seriously.   Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about the rest of this restaurant. It's really swanky-trendy-cool in here. Literally what you think in your mind when you think tiki lounge with a modern twist. So they've got that right!   Lots of choices and flavors, got that right too! Great drinks, yup, that too! We decided to go with their Tuesday deal, 2 appetizers and 2 cocktails for $20, plus a couple extra appetizers since we were all sharing.The ceviche and poke were the standouts, in my opinion and I really loved my blood orange martini!   Above all, their service was great! Everyone from the host to the multiple people that helped us out were incredible! There were a couple spills at the table next to us and instead of getting too over excited or frustrated the staff just seamlessly helped them clean it all up. It was awesome! I've had to work as a server/host so I definitely know how it is with drinks/hot food/birthdays/big groups. It can be a mess sometimes, but this place handles it soooo well!   My only regret is that I didn't order a drink that came in one of their cute tiki cups!

From the minute I stepped out of my car and saw the wall art that said, "Work hard &  be cool to people," I knew this was going to be an amazing place. The door this was next to seemed more like a back entry but either way, I was still greeted with smiling faces and helpful people.   It wasn't busy so the host gave us a choice of sitting indoors or outdoors. We chose outdoors since it was incredibly nice out. Our server helped us out with drinks right away. We were celebrating so we went with a pitcher of beer to start, but I do love the option or ordering a, "short one," here. It's just a choice a lot of places don't really offer anymore, so kudos for that Joyride!   Moving along, I ordered a crispy fish taco and the Mexican street corn. Both really, really good and super tasty next to our beer choice. I highly recommend at least one crispy fish taco while you're here!   But let's get back to the design of the place. Like all of the uptown restaurants, it's got it's own flavor of trendy design. Be sure to check out the wall next to the bathroom, it's interactive. When I was there, it said, "In this life, I will..." and guests can contribute whatever they want to the wall. Oh, and it you're chewing gum, make sure to use one of their cute little gum things (in the sugar caddy) to dispose of it before you eat. They are so cute!   My only regret is that we got here a little before Happy Hour and had not realized it until after we ordered, but that's our bad. I'll be back for it! Really amazing place! Check it out for yourself!

This place is AMAZING! From the times I've been out late drinking at Bikini Lounge and need a late night snack, or  the times I've finished work pretty late and can't even think about cooking, this place has never failed.   Their prices are good, their hours work for later eaters, and most of all, their pizza is good! I also really enjoy their slice option. Since moving to Phoenix, from a big city where slice places are mostly the only option, it's been hard to find a good slice place. For a while, I almost never ate pizza here because there is something  weird and gluttonous about ordering an entire pizza for my lonesome. That, and I'd have to eat the pizza for an entire week. But I'll stop digging into the loser hole right now. Thank you for the slices, Grand AVenue Pizza!   Whole pizzas are still an option for those who want it. AND they have calzones. Just to clear things up.   Another thing I really loved about this place was their staff. Everyone is so friendly and happy to be here! I walked in once on a Saturday night and the employee up front was taking a phone order from a drunken customer. While most people would find the customers incoherence frustrating, the employee took the call with ease and happiness. 5 stars for that alone!   Overall, cool place and great pizza!

I initially stopped here because I liked the name and the idea that this wasn't home or work, but an actual Third Space. Really cool concept!   I stopped in on a weekday afternoon for lunch. It wasn't crowded but there were still people hanging out or lingering around. It was a nice day so I took a seat outside. Ted, one of the servers helped me out almost immediately. I went with, "The Veg," sandwich with the pesto potato salad. The sandwich was awesome! Goat cheese, olive tapanade and spinach between two slices of grilled bread. So good. But the pesto potato salad. OMG. This was divine! (If you know me, I usually dislike potato salads or anything of the same consistency. It's just usually not my thing.) But the pesto potato salad at ThirdSpace, don't miss out!   After eating, I walked around to check out the shops and cool little artist things they had. I've  highlighted this before in other posts, but I REALLY REALLY love the shared/collaborative space here. There's a salon, art gallery, coffee roaster, coffee shop, restaurant and bar all in one space. It even looks as if its set up to have live performance. PHOENIX NEEDS MORE OF THIS! So thank you, ThirdSpace.   All in all, I love it! Everyone was super friendly, prices were great, and the food was incredible. ThirdSpace will probably soon be my actual third space!

This is my favorite sandwich franchise so you can imagine how excited I was when I saw that one had opened up on Mill Ave! It's my go to in Vegas when I want something quick and my go to in downtown Disney (Anaheim, CA) when we're all hungry after a long day of walking.   I usually go for the Veggie or Caprese but I've never heard anyone complain about the taste of any of the other sandwiches. In fact, it's my grandpa's favorite tuna melt...and he loves tuna!   The sandwiches are moderately priced and they're  pretty consistent with the taste (always a plus with franchise restaurants). With the Tempe location, I really loved the friendliness of the staff. Everyone was available to answer questions and help us find what we needed right away! The location of the actual shop is easily missed as its squeezed right in between two other establishments. Keep an eye out for this one!
