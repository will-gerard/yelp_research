We had the best wonton soup ever. But as good as the soup was it didn't compare to the excellent service we received from Rodrigo!!! Thanks for making it an even nicer experience then what we expected.

Had a wonderful dinner last night at Galkaghers. My ribeye was so tender and the clam chowder soup was amazing. A shout out to Todd as a great waiter who went out of his way to go and make tarter sauce for my friend. Gio his assistant was always on top of you needed a refill or plates cleared. Outstanding service and a wonderful meal.  Thanks for a great experience.

Went to this establishment twice. Our server Tracy was so good that we asked for her the second time. The ambience and food made you feel like you were in Ireland.  Loved the shepherds pie, Brie and the clams.

so as you can see by my prior review the last two times we were here everything was great.  Today we were seated at a table that is right in the middle of traffic as people walk right through from the street just to get to the casino.  Also, I was so looking forward to the Sheperds Pie and I was so disappointed. My girlfriends crab cake was tasteless. The only good item we ordered was the creamed corn.  Our server Timothy was very nice and brought my friend a bread pudding cake for her birthday. It was so nice of Timothy to give her the cake since the hostess informed me that they were under new management and only shots are offered.  Lastly, the music was so loud you couldn't have a conversation and it was so unpleasant we couldn't wait to finish our meal.  Not sure if we will ever dine there again.   Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.

This store never disappoints me. Every time I have asked for a product that the store does not carry, they manage to get it for me.  Thanks Rex for getting me the sparkling smart water. You made my day! I'm always willing to pay a little more to get the kind of customer service AJ's provides.  Thanks again.

If you want your eyebrows done you need to go to Jane. Jane is very professional and thorough. She explains what she is going to and what you should ask of your permanent makeup  artist.  I lost most of my eyebrows from cancer and I am so happy now. I get compliments all the time.  So stop searching and just go to Jane.  Naomi

My friend and I went to lunch here on February 3, 2016. We were very happy with the food and the service. A shout out to Morgan who gave us excellent service and went out of her way to get me a sample of the "soup of the day".  We will definitely be back!

My friend and I both had the Brie crepe. It was amazing.  The place was very cute inside and the owners are from the French countryside.  Everyone should try this place.

My girlfriend and I reconnected after over 40 years and went to North Arcadia to have lunch and catch up.  Our server Michael was very attentive and knew the menu well.  The Woman manager and Michael wanted us to have dessert on them because today was a very momumental moment.  I always enjoy eating there but I will definitely go more often now Naomi Sherman

What a disappointment. We were to stay at only 4-5 star hotels. However this hotel falls very short of that.  When we checked in we were told we would have to walk many steps to our room. Of course that was impossible since I use a cane so we asked to change the room. They changed it to a much smaller room that it was impossible for two people and suitcases to move around.  The staff at the front desk on arrival were rude and we had to pay in advance for our breakfast to get a discount. The breakfast was $15 in US dollars and it was a poor selection for the money.  The gentleman who helped with our bags was pleasant and our tour company said breakfast was included which it was not. I would not recommend this place.  Our tour company Tenon Tours said we were centrally located to shops and exhibits which we weren't. I walked up a very steep hill just to get to five shops and with my illness this was extremely hard. This hotel had no parking so the driver had to walk blocks to put our luggage in the car.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.

I receive excellent service at Bloom. The product is never disappointing and the staff remembers all the customers. Their price point is great and I highly recommend going there then places that charge high prices and poor service.

Went with other people for dinner and everything we heard about this place was correct.  The decor was kept like it was originally. The Mission attached to the restaurant gave it a small village feel.  My pizza was excellent and I tried my friend's a Jiffy hamburger. Never knew peanut butter would be good on a burger.  Shelby was our server and was quite knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive.  Going back for sure!
