As I gave a presentation early in the week on Memorable Customer Service. A woman mentioned this place.  I am delighted by the food, and especially the service!  Wonderful find. Support local business, and having amazing cuisine makes it easier.

What an amazing meal. We are never disappointed, and tonight's lamb shank special. Superb!  No need to have a flashy exterior, when you have fantastic food in the interior.

My insurance company set up my tow with this company. As I wait for my vehicle to arrive at the repair shop I am told by Central Towing that they piggy backed my tow with someone else's vehicle. This is completely unacceptable as I waste my time waiting while they make another stop. I paid for my car to be towed, not a shared experience like a furniture moving van. I also let State Farm know.

Mere words alone cannot describe the tantalizing cuisine found here. The Oscars New Mexico Ceviche is to die for served with warm blue corn and regular tortilla chips. My entree, the pork chop stuffed with chorizo was incredible! It's very casual and a friendly locals atmosphere. Find a reason to eat here, you will not be disappointed!

I'm sure that men generally do not have any strong preferences when it comes to selecting a place for a haircut.   Most probably get a sense of "gosh my hair is long" and pull into the first place they find.  My Yelp search led me to Snapdragon under a near similar circumstance.  My semi-regular place had no open slots for me on two occasions, so being the impatient guy that I am....I decided to go elsewhere.    My call to them was a slight desperation to "get it done today". I called at 4:30pm and they were able to get me in at 6:00pm.   While a few minutes away, I received a call from the salon that they were running behind by 15 minutes and wanted to be respectful of my time.   I said I was OK to wait the extra 15 minutes and I arrived right before 6pm.   I was warmly greeted and again was given an apology for the wait.  I was offered coffee or water and the waiting area was very comfortable.  I was astonished when right at 6pm, the hostess let me know they moved some things around and I could be accommodated at my appointed time! Wowza!   The haircut itself (thank you to Cassondra) turned out to be one of the best cuts I have ever received!   My claim to this is based on the meticulous detail she spent doing the cut.   No shears #1, #2, etc., etc., run over my scalp like most places.  The only electrical device used was the blow dryer to occasionally remove the loose hair.  She took her time and has great pride in her work. (I have 3 cowlicks and she said it was a fun challenge!)   I did not feel the cut was being rushed or like I was an intrusion in an already hectic day.   The words I will use to describe Snapdragon Salon is...Genuine Care and Comfort for all of their clients. As a first timer, I was warmly greeted and never felt that this place was snobby or elite.    I am definitely going back to Cassondra and will make sure that all of my friends know of this hidden gem along Camelback Road.

I wanted to like this local family owned establishment so much, but I just cannot after my breakfast order.  I basically had eggs Benedict with sausage patty instead of Canadian bacon. It came with country hollandaise sauce even though I asked to keep the regular, the eggs were overcooked and basically boiled. When you cut them the inside yolk was solid. I mentioned to my server and although he apologized no attempt to reduce my bill was made.  Not very good service recovery in my opinion.  The hash browns were good as was the crispy bacon that I asked for. The coffee also was fresh to the taste.

I give one star and it's completely related to the lack of empowerment by management.  It's 6pm, and I asked for the drink special offer that was presented to me. The server then said it was no longer available.  Now feeling bummed that it was not mentioned to me beforehand,  I said I would order something different,  it was $1 more and I asked the server to price this at $10, the same as the special.  She reported back that managememt refused to make the adjustment, even in light of the previous drink not being available.

I'm back and delighted to retry the drink that was unavailable from my last visit. The vibe is terrific and the bartender Chris is very engaging. There is of course no doubt the food will be excellent.

Besides the amazing regular menu items, the specialty entr√©e offerings change it up nicely. The chef is the best.

Eli makes the cheesecake. He rotates them at times and they are amazing creations!  Tonight it's sweet potato with a cranberry marshmallow cream sauce. Holy smokes, it's wonderful.

Even with a lapse in visits, coming back to Solo for the chichen picattta, and hearing about the latest cheesecake creations from Eli, makes this place all the more special. Rocky Road cheesecake, awesome

Sometimes we drive right by strip mall restaurants for fear of their quality.  Dino's is tucked into the strip mall, but the food is amazingly delightful.  The bread is made onsite and fluffy on the inside. It is served with butter, but if they could offer oil and balsamic it would enhance the presentation. It's already a flavorful round pre-cut.  The salad dressing is homemade and not overbearing at all with the garlic and spices.  I had the chicken piccata with artichoke and mushrooms over angel hair pasta. It was a fine portion entree.  The chicken was sliced mixed in and so the dish was easy to eat. Flavor was well balanced.  Not much lemony which was fine, because I contemplated Marsala style. Tasty either way.  I skipped dessert but the offerings in the bakery area made it tempting. No dessert menu, so you need to walk over to the cases to pick out something nice. I would recommend this for casual nights out and enjoy a wonderful meal with low key ambiance.
