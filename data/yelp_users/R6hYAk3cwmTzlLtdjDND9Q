(Late posting guys! I just realized it was an unfinished review. This visit was on 4/1/14-4/03/14)  I really enjoyed it here because it was QUIET  :-)  I requested the 2nd floor. The staff was great! You get a "free" soda upon check in. I would definitely go back! I checked out, ended my last interview on the other side of town (Tempe location) and was able to change my clothes over there before I jetted out of town.  What was most important to me was that my room was on the inside of the building & QUIET!

I'm "late" as usual w/ my reviews BUT here's my 2cent.   I really liked this Walmart it wasn't crowded when I went in around 1pm on a Thursday. What impressed me was that they had the Lactose Free Yoplait (yay!) that I could never find - the Walmart, Target & Frys near me (85255) don't carry it.  The store was clean, organized & the staff was very nice. I will definitely take the drive 2 this location!

"Late posting"  My BDay is in May and my visit was at the end of April for a "new AZ Drivers license"  it's big, everything went smooth, the guy that waited on me was very nice- I forgot his name but he's a New Yorker.  I was in & out within 30 min. I liked it better than the DMV or as we say in Michigan - Secretary Of State.

I like the actual "store" BUT getting some help is the WORST!  My 1st visit Last week I had to call the store while in the store 3 times to get help in the bakery. Now today I needed a price chk and called the store 3 times AGAIN- finally asked 4 the STORE MANAGER (it's 2:44pm 7/18/15) and still NO HELP...I hung up! Just TERRIBLE!  1 star cause I had to!

Clothes are nice BUT customer service a complete ZERO!  My friend &I walked around the whole 1st floor, passed the registers and asked for the manager and still NO one greeted us or anything. We made our way upstairs - nothing - I asked for the manager told her what happened and she replied w/ a "weak" I'm sorry then I replied by telling her this was my 1st time here and if I was going to spend money NOT!   My friend "raved" about Zara and I couldn't wait to go but after my experience and reading the other reviews here I think NOT. Just terrible customer service!

1st time here! They would have received 5 stars BUT....the young man on the register was really nice, the lady B4 me was called 4 her order and a few minutes after I went 2 the counter to get the wifi info (that didn't show up in my iPhone)  then that's when I noticed MY order just sitting there. The guy from the back DID NOT call my name. So what if I never got up? He claimed he wasn't the one to bring it out...looks like that's your job 4 the day. Anyway things happen maybe it was a "little" mistake who knows. I'm going to still have a "Fabulous" day!     I had the Acai Banana Berry Bowl  it was good but would have been better if that experience did  NOT happen. You know I'm NOT going to 4get it. The bad thing about it is that this location is 5 min. from my home. I'm BIG on customer service- I have to deliver the best everyday to my clients and I expect the same.  Anyway NO 5 Stars due to that happening to me today.

I came here because the location @ Tatum & Bell a "Franchise" DIDN'T carry BEEF? Are U kidding me! I don't eat Pork & I want more than just cheese on my pizza  Well the staff @ the E. Greenway location were nice. The Manager - sorry I forgot his name  :-(   was GREAT w/ a pleasant attitude! I asked him about sauce and he gave me the sauce & crazy bread for FREE for taking the drive!  :-D   I live in N. Scottsdale and I will definitely drive back!   The Little Caesers @ 4550 E. Bell Rd  are definitely LOSING out. Who ever heard of a pizza place that doesn't have ground beef! o_O
