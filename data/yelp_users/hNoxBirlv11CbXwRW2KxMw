Paid for some repair work here. After the problem continued I took it to another mechanic. I was informed that the spark plugs and air filter for the ac I paid to be replaced were never done. When I spoke with them regarding this issue they were very rude and aggressive.

It was 5 pm on a Friday and my iguana needed medical attention.  The reptile hospital would take him but it was over 200. So I called Ahwatukee Animal Hospital.  They got us right in and for a fraction of the price. So grateful for these guys. They also got my cat right in on a Saturday morning. The staff and vets are very kind and their rates are very reasonable and they don't charge an arm and a leg. This hospital is a gift for our area. I highly recommend!

These guys used to be great, but they aren't anymore.  Spent 500 there to fix my ac and after going  back 3 times they still couldn't fix it.  I then took it to EDS and they fixed it for 150.  The management has changed and they lack a good work ethic.  Had the oil changed there too and asked them to check the car, they said everything looked great and then I was in there 2 weeks later for struts that they didn't notice before because they didn't look.

I went here based on the yelp reviews.  Well....yelp you have let me down again.  This place is expensive and bland there are so many places that are cheaper and way better that are locally owned (St. Francis).  It was loud, the service was slow, hardly any beer selection and the fish was marginal and farm raised.  Go somewhere else......save your money.

I love this store.  They have really high quality materials and classes to help you learn.  Locally owned and very friendly.  The only draw back is you pay a little more.  Overall I am happy to spend my money there.

Terrible!  First the internet service is slow and drops, second after having the service for 3 years they raise the price and I switch to Century Link.  Cox calls me and tells me after I switch that they can give me a better rate after all this time.  Then they start charging me for a modem something that I never ordered and I have to play fix the bill with them over and over......

I have been very happy with this place. Dave the owner is great at communicating with the parents. The atmosphere is friendly and laid back. I like the variety of tutors that work with the children they are great at teaching the concepts in a way children can relate to and are also good role models.   As a teacher I like that they have a organized system that makes sure to fill in any holes students may have from back to kindergarten.  I also like as they master skills they are continually challenged. The reward system they have my children enjoy as well.  Convince is also huge here. You can drop off when it works for your schedule, you don't have to have a set time or day.

I love these guys.  They took care of my Uncle's old bloodhound while he was in the hospital.  He isn't the easiest dog to get along with, but they are amazing.  They come in and write down everything that is going on with the dog and the house. The staff is friendly and personable with the animals. I was resonsbile for taking care of his house while he was in the hosptial and TLC was great about keeping me posted on the dog, pool ect.  They are great.  Margie thinks of everything so you can go away without a worry.  They are also resonable priced for the services provided.  They can do almost anything.    They are kind and compassionate and are ready and willing to take care of pets and their owners!!!

Dr. Hunt is by far one of the best vets I have used.  I drive all the way from Ahwatukee to see him.  First it is easy to get in the same day he runs his office on time.  He is very resonably priced, he doesn't run up the bill.  He takes his time with each visit to discuss any concerns and explain things.  I love him! He is an amazing vet and I would recommend him to anyone needing a vet.

The eye doctor at Costco was great.  Eye exam was only 55 and they really took their time and did a complete exam.  Worked great with my kids and I didn't have to wait at all!.   But  what I was totally pleased with the eyeglasses department!!!!  My Mom has terrible eye sight and we have to get her new glasses every six months while shopping around her glasses at other places were over 500 dollars plus they were trying to upgrade her on things.  So I took her to Costco concerned that they might not be able to do her special lenses.  Let me tell you there were great not only could they do her lenses but they were able to do digital progressive which we didn't even consider because of cost.  At Costco it was standard. And I also found out how the eyeglass shops try to scam people!!  They are very helpful and knowledgeable.  I will say you may have to wait a bit  In the end the glasses we thought were going to cost over 500 cost only 160.  And next time we may be able to use the same frames again and save even more.

Great place!  The atmosphere is great and the service is friendly and attentive.  The food is fresh and unique with a healthy flair.  The almond margarita is to die for and you must get a dessert.  Toffee Cake is a great one.  We loved the toffee cake so much they gave us the recipe.

After growing up on a cattle ranch in Texas it has be a little tough to find good meat in Phoenix.  Look no further than Von Hansons!  They are knowledgeable and friendly and their product is far superior to anything at a high priced grocery store.  You may pay a little more but the quality is worth it.

Wonderful Dentist. My son knocked a filling out at 6.  Called Dr. Barella and he stayed late and got him patched up.  Was wonderful with my daughter as well.  I love this place, they don't triple book so your appointment is actually the time they scheduled.  They are all very professional and caring!

The first time I came here I was wowed!  But this time not so much.....The service was terrible I mean terrible and it wasn't even busy.  What was even more maddening is that I saw the servers in the bar area chatting and messing around while all of us were waiting.  The entire time we were there we saw our waitress twice once to order and once when we asked for our check from someone else.  I couldn't even get a glass of water.   While the food is good and the beer is great all surrounded by a great atmosphere the manager needs to make sure his or her staff is working for the customer instead of flirting with the other staff.

This was the worst medical care I have recievied.  The doctor was no responsive and when her nurse did contact me her information regarding my case was completely wrong.  After going to another doctor I found out that they did not run a complete work up on my condition before making a decision.    When I asked to speak with the office manager she would not talk to me to discuss the problems with the practice.

These guys are the best.  It all started when we had a roof rat in our attic.  They sealed up our house right away to prevent it from happening again and got that sucker!  My neighbors used them too and after setting up bait stations no rats for the last year!    We have been using them for over 4 years.  They come every month and check with me to see if I have had any problems.  They are very honest and fair in their pricing.  Plus they are a locally owned company.  It doesn't get any better than that.   If I ever have a problem they are on it.

Beer Mecca! What a great little locally-owned business with a kick ass beer selection!  The staff is well versed on beer and the food is high quality and interesting.  My personal favorite is the Chipotle Mac and Cheese.   P.S. Great people watching and super friendly crowd.

This a very well run office. Dr. Curtis is very gentle and personable. He is also very fair in pricing and does minimally invasive treatments.  Both of my kids go here and after investing several other orthos he was by far the best and cheapest.

I stopped by here to check it out because I loved Postinos.  The wait staff is unfriendly and rude. They can't make a good martini to save their life.  There are much better places to go in that area that are a ton better.   If you are thinking of going here move on.

I went here after I broke up with my old hair stylist based on yelp reviews and I was so impressed with this place  Brandi cut my hair and did a great job.  Most times you get your hair done and it looks great but the next day when its your turn to do it, it looks terrible.  Not this time Brandi worked with my hair and cut and styled it in a way it worked for both me and my hair.  Love this place it's a keeper!!!

This is your guy.  A locally owned business where customer service and honesty are at the top.  We have been using Croffoot for over 4 years and even had them install  a new unit at my Mother's house.  They are very fair in their pricing and will work with you.    Support the good guy call Croffot!

Horrible Horrible Horrible!!! That is all I can say. The install guys are great but when it comes to billing that are totally clueless.  I was quoted 69.94 when I signed up and now my bill has gone up to 132.00 and I have to call and complain each month. And I thought Cox was bad.....

This is great bank.  Remember when banking was personal well MidFirst is what banking used to be.  Their friendly knowledgeable staff have worked with us on our personal banking and business banking.  I have recommended them to my friends and family.  They also have a great kids program for savings.  Their hours are great too open Sat. and Sun.

I have been very happy with Bear 2.  This is a small locally owned security business, that takes pride in their work and has a personal interest in taking care of their customers unlike the big businesses.  I highly recommend them not only are they local but also right in line with the big security companies in price.

This office was great.  I went in with a coupon for an oil change and had them check out some problems Discount Tire suggested I have investigated.  They made the repairs and it was far below what we had expected to pay.  The staff is friendly and the office is clean.  FYI you need to make an appointment and it does take some time for them to work on your car but they have a shuttle that will drop you off and pick you up. But this inconvenience is worth it knowing that quality work is being done.

This gym is wonderful . My son trained there in small group training and personal training and I have to say the program was fantastic. It is a great place for children and teenagers to learn Fitness fundamentals. They work out the kids in a great positive way and I have to say the intense exercise helped to reduce my sons ADHD struggles in school.   The gym is locally owned and run by great team who personally focus on your individual needs.

I really really wanted to love this place, so badly that I gave them 3 tries and each time was worse than the first. The atmosphere is great outside with trees, exotic birds and good music byt that's where it stops.  The menu is limited and is average at best.  If you are GF your are up a creek.  And the servers are horrible.  All 3 times they just couldn't serve to save their lives.  Everything took forever they would forget to bring something everytime and it took forever to get our food.  Keep in mind that it wasn't even that busy.  If I were you I would head over to San Tan.

The Ultimate Tree Service has been maintaining my trees for 2 years.  After interviewing and getting 3 estimates these guys were almost half of the other estimates.  I have one tree that leans and they have helped me maintain it so it doesn't have to be cut down. They were prompt did a great job.  When the job was completed they did a great job of cleaning up all the debris. They have also maintained all the trees at my church and have done a great job there as well.  I highly recommend them.  It is a small business worth supporting.
