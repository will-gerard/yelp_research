Very disappointed, especially after all the good reviews everyone seemed to give this place. The meatball sub was weak, the chowder tasted like it came out of a can, and the potato salad was so bad I couldn't finish more than the first bite.

This is my favorite Mexican food place in the state. I am a very picky Mexican food snob (having lived in Mexico for six years). They're famous for their green chile which is amazing but their salsa is incredible as well. I asked the owners and they told me they use an ingredient called espasote in their salsa that gives it its unique flavor. Delicious. Do yourself a favor and make the trip.

Definitely not gourmet fare, but if you're looking for a dang good gyro at a reasonable price, this place delivers.

This is my new favorite burger joint, hands down. The jalape√±o popper stuffed burger was phenomenal and the fries were done to perfection. The outrageous sauce is divine as well.

The fish tacos here are incredible. The carnitas tacos are delicious as well. We got the ceviche to start which was just okay, but the tacos more than made up for it. I'll definitely be coming back.
