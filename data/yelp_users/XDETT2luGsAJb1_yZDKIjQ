Every time we come here they are closed Yelp shows they open at 11 but know they only open at 5pm. We had a party of 15 show up at 12 pm for lunch  but of course they are closed will never come back here again the new owners must make to much money that they don't need all our business DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE CLOWNS

Came in today because restaurant had good Yelp reviews and left very disappointed had to send food back. In Yelp reviews its says how great the wings are and how big they are well to my disappointment wings were horrible and probably the smallest wings I have ever had. In the picture my pinky was bigger then each wing. So my guess is all the Yelp reviews where either bought reviews or fake accounts I wouldn't recommend this place to any one. I didn't only order wings I ordered also big pretzels with there beer bacon cheese dip and it it tasted like powder cheese mixed with beer not very good. But on a plus side they had awesome guacamole dip and salsa with chips.
