Dunkin who?  These are the best donuts I have ever had. I am not exaggerating, seriously the best. They are so soft and fresh. They have a big selection of specialty donuts, My personal favorite is the blueberry donut...not blueberry filled, the dough is blueberry. If you like fillers, they have just about every flavor. Enjoy.

This place is really good. I assumed it was like Kyoto Bowl, or Samurai Sams. It is a step up. If those places are like McDonalds, this place is like In-n-Out Burger. I ordered our dinner to go, My GF had a teriyaki/ Broccoli Bowl. She said it was good, but had some buyer's remorse once she tasted my Katsu Bowl. That thing was delicious. Lots of different flavors going on we were very impressed.  We had an order of California Rolls. They were freshly made, but came with only wasabi. I expected ginger to be in there so I didn't ask...Bummed to find that when I got home, but I should've asked so...  There was a big ass ant on the counter, but for all I know he jumped off my shirt. He looked lost and out of place. Unconcerned. (So why'd a mention? I dunno)  Great bang for the buck, 2 very filling bowls, and 4 cali rolls for about $16. I will go back for sure.

I enjoy going to Manuels. I had never been to this location until last night.   It is clean, the food is delicious, the service is friendly. The prices are on par with other comparable mexican food places.  My GF smashed her food quickly and was thoroughly satisfied. She told me to give them 5 stars. I told her to get her own Yelp account LOL.  I give them 4 stars. They lost the fifth star because I felt like the menu was pretty limited. What they did have on the menu sounded really good, but I felt like I was lacking options.  I tried the chicken fajitas. They were indeed good, but I was expecting more trim to come with my sizzling skillet. The skillet itself was delicious; chicken, onions, bell peppers, half tomato, and cilantro (on the stems?)...But on the side, just two tortillas, green sauce, guac, and sour cream. I am used to other places also giving me some shredded cheese, lettuce, and maybe pico de gayo. It was good, and that is their design. I guess I just care for a more vibrant fajita.   Oh yeah and this is the kind of place that gives you rice "OR" beans, but not both (most meals)...I think there's something screwed up with that. Anybody want a Jelly sandwich? Peanutbutter is available if you order it seperate.  None the less, I was full, and my lady was pleased. I will certainly go back anytime.   Popos is still king.

I just moved to the northside, and was looking for pizza/wing place. I drove by here a few times so i tried it out.  It tastes pretty close to little ceasars. It even smells like little ceasars.  Difference is, I know what I am walking into when i get a LC pizza, I only do it for the price $5 and having it "now".  However for $25 for a pizza and wings, I expect something better than Little Ceasars. The pizza was chewey and cardboardish, and tasted just like LC. The wings had a "different" flavor...wasn't great, wasn't horrible, but the sauce looked like old cooking grease.  I walked in 20 minutes after my phone order (they said 20). Pizza wasn't ready so I took a seat. Some guy put a pizza out, but the register goon took 3 more orders before looking at it, and nobody else working bothered to ask the room who is waiting. So in all, i waited ten minutes after showing up, 7 of which my pizza was sitting right there. It was cold when I got home. The kids dug in, but I had a turkey sandwich.  Freaking nasty, overpriced, and incompetent staff. I will never go back.

This is a good place to grab a nice quiet breakfast. Tried it for the first time last weekend. The price is fair, spent about $25 after tip for two of us. The food was delicious. The service was good. Had a ten minute wait to be seated at 11AM on a Sunday.  Our waiter kept our drinks refilled. Unfortunately their cups are so small that I required 4 refills, but I never felt neglected. Honestly the small cup thing scared me, that had real potential to screw up my meal if they weren't paying attention...but they were so it's all good.  I had a real generic breakfast of eggs, bacon, pancakes, and a side of toast. It was all very good. I paid the extra $1 for "thick" bacon, and that was totally worth it. My girl got cornbeef hash and eggs, and she thought it was very good.  Next time I probably will try the "New Orleans Omelet". Sounded good, but at a new place I usually go generic to test the water, and get fancy my 2nd go around.   Impressive breakfast, I probably would've kissed that cook.

I am actually really bummed because I moved to North Phoenix, and have yet to find a good pizza place up here. I have been going to Palermos for 10 years while I had lived in Avondale. The location on 83rd and buckeye, and 91st and thomas, are just the same.  These are my absolute favorite wings, anywhere, ever. They have the sauce calibrated to perfection. I am regularly yelled at as a wing hog by my family.  The pizza is really good. some people call it soggy, but I think it's just very soft. It is very thin, but they crisp it just right, to allow it to remain soft, with a very light crunch to it. the end crust is so freaking good, and that is always usually crunchy. The pizza is enormous. If you have kids, you can cut the peices in half for them.   2 slices + 10 wings, and I'm wasted. Pizza wasted.  The dude there has been there forever, and he's friendly as hell.   I cannot find a place like this anywhere on the northside!! :(  **Dip you pizza in the wing sauce**OMFG wow!

Went for lunch with my work crew...they were packed, but we happened to get a table immediately. We had 2 dozen medium wings as an appetizer which were delicious. I had the Mahi Mahi plate which was outstanding. I only had one issue, they stalled me out halfway through the meal because it took forever for anyone to check my drink...i take a drink after every bite, so when i have no drink i cannot eat either...this is a common thing for most restaurants so i am not going to trash the review over it.  finally got it and finished up, super full and satisfied.

so tried this out...had decent reviews..The place smelled delicious. The name is inviting. the hostess is hot.  So my girl and I go to try it out.   They brought us our drinks. $2.50 each. They brought us each a glass of ice and a soda can. LMAO-For reals??  No refills.  so for us each to have a refill would've cost $10 total in drink. I can buy like 4 12 packs of soda for that price. I mean if you are bringing it in cans, don't get mad at me comparing!  We told them we were going to smoke while we waited for our food. Then we just left. I would never dine and dash, but seriously, soda cans?  soda cans.  I have no idea how the food is.

I will always love Pete's. I love everything on the menu, except for the Fish and Chips.  I guess that's because I am a hardcore fish and chips fan. Like from a legit restaurant. ya know, like halibut and chips, with malt vinegar and tartar sauce...ya know the good stuff Pete's doesn't serve that. LOL.  If you know that going in, then you will be fine. Everything else is bomb. I love the shrimp, that is good.  My regular meal (unchanged for 25 years) Is a monster burger with cheese (extra sauce) and a burrito. I steal my girl's shrimp.  Secret sauce is ketchup/ tobasco 50/50  I can understand the low ratings. I bet that people who rated them low, love LEGIT FISH AND CHIPS, and expected such. Don't go here for that, try everything else.  If they ever get good F-N-C I will give them that 5th star.  Oh yeah, cash only? annoying for us, smart for them...Avoiding Uncle Sam-lol with their handwritten tickets.  They aren't open on Sundays either. (bs)

Very good pizza.   I pretty much stick with one pizza place when I find one I love. My favorite pizza places that I have been exclusive to would be Palermos and #1 Brothers. Unfortunately They are a bit of a drive now, but luckily I found Luna Pizza. Very similar to those two, with that classic New York thin crust- inner soft with an outter crunch..Kinda greasy in a great way...kind of pizza you can fold. They have very good wings...the flavor anyway, they weren't very wet...I like my wings soaking, but these are good regardless...  Very large slices. I get the large pizza + 20 wings for like $25....Easily takes care of a family of 4, most of us can't put down more than two pieces. So this is my new place since it is only a mile from my house. I really like it, and highly recommend!!

It was okay...  more topping choices, but no better than In and Out Burger. Twice as expensive. The fries were unique but i didn't care for them too much. It was cold and loud inside. Meh whatever.

I love Popos. I have been going to the Indian School location my whole life. Living in North Phoenix, i was stoked to find out about their new location. I finally tried it out last night.  I got my regular- Green chili Burrito Enchillada Style with r/b. It was excellent as always. The service was very fast. They re-filled my drinks quickly.  It was very clean and nice in the new location.   Rec a million times.

MF Legit.  I didn't know how good they were to me, until I moved from Avondale to N. Phx. They hook up deals, and take care of you if you are a reg.  HINT: Plan an extra 5 minutes into your trip, they love to shoot the breeze. Everyone's chill here.

Had a great time. 2 adults, and 5 kids. I think I paid out like $88. actually not bad for 7 people to have a blast. I thiink I had the most fun out of everyone. The kids had a great time making sure to get the heck out of my way.  STRETCH STRETCH STRETCH. You are not young anymore, you will feel this in the morning.  on the b-ball hoop I was doing windmill dunks, reverse dunks, between the leg Vince Carter dunks, it was fun as hell.  The foam pit isn't as soft as it looks, and yes it's a bitch to crawl out of.  I would have been down to do back flips off the wall, but the small sized trampolines makes it to scary since you have to avoid the borders. I would've enjoyed bigger trampolines. I haven't been to other trampoline parks, except for Thrasher Land back in the late 80's. this is a million times safer.  Staff was very nice and friendly. The sign-in, and shoe return was easy and organized.  Surprisingly it didn't smell nearly as bad as I expected it to smell.  I had a damn good time, and I will go back. I want to try out some of the other parks, but since I don't know about them yet, I guess I can call this the best.

I was so pissed off last night when i ordered a torta from fillibertos.  It was disgusting...all the carnitas was burnt to hell...etc...  i was so mad- that tonight I set out to find a delicious torta. I found Kissi...WOW.  That was the best torta I have ever had. I had the pierna...the bread was very fresh, the meat was soft and perfect...ordered everything on it and added pico de gayo. I am pretty consistent and when i find something i like i stick with it. This is now my torta place.  Oh and they were very nice...i have never seen a menu like that, they explained all the different stuff...never heard of "pastor" or "pierna", etc...  Awesome.
