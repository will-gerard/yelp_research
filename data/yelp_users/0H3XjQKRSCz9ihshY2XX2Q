This place is the best in middle eastern food in the valley.  Lost count on how many times I've been here.  There's not a single bad thing I can say about this place.  They do get extremely busy on weekends so please stop your complaining on service.   The food is well worth the wait.

Fck this place over and over.  I dropped wife's car off to get oil change and wash.  Told the guys specifically and numerous times that I only wanted basic oil and wash.  No upgrades to synthetic or anything.  The car is leased and can give two shits what dannys or jscksons recommends. After almost two hours later shooting at the range across the street car is still there.  In the oil bay untouched.  The oil change asshole insisted that the car needs synthetic.   It's a fucken toyota!?!!?!  I told I gave specific instructions.  This prick was more interested in up selling that anything.  He even made notes that I denied what the dealer tells me to do.  Fck u!!!! I've leased half a dozen cars in my life and this lowlife trash is going to tell me what to do???? I replaced the air filters 2 months ago and that needed changed of course according to trash. Fuck this place again.  I'll pay more and go somewhere else

Had high expectations.  Was very disappointed.  Beautiful restaurant and scenery but the food was over rated.   Awful crab cake.  Filets were not good at all. Donovan's on camelback is 100 times better.   Like I said if you don't care about your food and are looking for cool views and ambience this place is it!

The poorest excuse for an ITALIAN restaurante.   The worst service and most disgusting food.  F*ck this place.  I had 14 guests there for my birthday and spent $800 on crap.  These sons of bitches mixed water in our Patron Tequila shots.  5 guests ordered lamb chops and all were burnt to a crisp and RAW on the inside.  Pasta was chewy like gum and stuck to our teeth.   Marsala sauce looked like BBQ sauce.  Absolutely pathetic!!!!!!!  Half of my guests didnt even eat anything off their plates and the retarded waitors nor the manager would even care why the plates were coming back untouched.   long story short this place sucks and some of my guests n myself grabbed a burger and in & out.   Good thing is I work directly across the street from there and work with many clients and I make sure I tell everyone how gross their food and  service is.This was only half the story as I get too frustrated to type anymore.  (great place to impress a chick that night but thats it!!!) PS.....................please please please support your local mom and pop restaurants.

The worst car wash spot in all AZ.   Just brought my brand new x6 to get washed.  They managed to scratch the hood with a hand wash.  Some convict approaches me saying they didn't do it and that this happens with hand washes. (Btw all they employ are ex convicts since they lost their hard working illegals). So I payed extra for a hand wash for these pricks to scratch my hood????   BEWARE DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!

As I have been burned many times by the famous chains out here (dannys), and have lost all patience.  Finding pitstop was a blessing.   Went to their location at the air park for the first time and They were great!!!  They took care of my car like it was their own.  Liked them so much that they have mobile service coming to my job site every 2 weeks and wash all 4 of our cars to perfection.  Warning! If you are cheap and don't care above your ride this is def not the place for you.  If you love your ride then this is definitely your spot.

First things first! If you have champagne taste and a beer budget this isn't for you.  If you complain about pricing in Scottsdale you can always Go to filibertos where your beef came from a coyote or victims of cartel violence. Anyhow this place is awesome From service to food.  Holden, Gio and Mike are the best servers they have there.  They make the experience ten times better.  Very knowledgable about the menu and drinks.  Their appetizers are unique creations.  I've tried several different tacos on the menu and loved the garlic rib eye taco the most.   You must must must try their Kobe Skirt Steak.  (For those that complain about price do research on KOBE beef. It didn't come from the LA Lakers) They have the best skirt steak in town.   Will def be a regular for years to come.   Thank you guys

Huge fan of starbucks but this location was the worst of the worst I've been too.  The barista was rude and clueless about the drinks and POS system.  Took her 10 min to ring up 2 drinks. She Over charged me for my drink and received the wrong drink at the end.  This almost made me hate starbucks as a whole.  Will still be a customer just never back here even if they got the last coffee bean in AZ.
