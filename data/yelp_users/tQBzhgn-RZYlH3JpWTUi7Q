Always Unleashed is the best boarding facility I have taken my dog to. Their staff is always friendly and knows my dog by name when I call to make a reservation or come in. Their kennel free environment allows for non stop fun and their temperament testing of all new dogs allows me to rest at ease knowing she will be safe. Their yard is shaded and well cooled even offering a pool which is very important for the hot summer months in Arizona. Every time I pick my pup up from a stay or day of play she is utterly exhausted from all the fun she has had. I also love their monitoring system which allows me to check in on my pup whenever I want. All of this AND their prices are extremely reasonable. They also have great add ins like nail trimming and baths so your pup is ready to come home fresh and clean.

Had our first experience with Casanova's on Sunday night and I was beyond impressed. I lived in NYC for 6 years and have turned in to some what of a pizza snob, always on the hunt for a pizza spot similar to ones in NYC. I finally found it! From their menu and toppings, to the experience at pick-up and then the actual pie itself, everything was excellent and of superior quality.  When I picked up the pie the woman behind the counter asked me if I was a new customer, she then shouted to the kitchen, using my name, that I was new and everyone cheered saying "hi/welcome Tiffany". She then offered me an order of free garlic knots to try as a first time customer. It definitely set the tone for what then was the best pizza I have found in Arizona, and quite frankly outside of NYC.  This is a must try and is now the only pizza place I will be ordering from.

After having lived in NYC for 6 years I was so excited to get a taste of NYC in AZ. While waiting in line to order however, I was disappointed to see two employees throwing food at each other back and fourth over the line. This is not acceptable. When I asked to speak with a manager the cashier told him/her my complaint but the manager never came to speak to me. I saw the manager ask some of the employees if they were throwing food and of course their answer was no. The food was as good as it was in NYC but with the excitement and rush of customers it appears more training needs to be spent on who is hired.
