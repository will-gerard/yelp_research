I love this place. Love the logo, love the open-air Saturday market, love the selection, love the people, love the passion.  Dear Gods:  I pray for world peace and Sunday hours at PPM.  Amen.

I could probably buy the ingredients to cook my own breakfast, cook it, wolf it, and start on the dishes in the time in takes to get served here.  I also found out after eating here that they've come up a few times with 3 or more health code violations. Last month: SIX VIOLATIONS.

Not my scene at all but these five stars go to the DJ. I never got his name but he's the big bald guy that rocks the fuck out. In turn, I rocked the fuck out. Thank you.

I found this place when I was looking for shisha at the new smoke shop across the parking lot. I went in and checked it out.  There is a small lunch counter inside this grocery store and I tried an aloo gobi to go, potato and cauliflower with rice and naan. It took awhile to be prepared but not too long. It cost $6.55 and tasted very homemade. It was also way more spicy than I expected but I loved that. I had forgotten to request a spiciness level and it was intense in just the right way.  Credit card payments have to be a minimum of $10 or they charge you 35 cents. Seems fair to me.  I'm going to go back there next week and try the desi pizza or something with chicken in it. They have some Indian wrap things, masala, korma and what looked to be some common Indian dishes like samosas, etc. The prices are affordable and it was fun to wander around and look at the stuff on the store shelves. There are lots of prepackaged Indian dishes that I think I'll try. They all cost between $2.50 and $3.50 and look very authentic.

This part of town is growing. It wasn't a difficult drive and was basically all freeway for me from 7th/McDowell area. 10 to the 51 to the 101 and then Tatum is right there.  I need two more visits to see everything here and by then the exhibits will have changed.  I feel like the musical clips at each exhibit could be a little longer.  I am really happy that the MIM is in Phoenix. I can think of a lot of other cities that could have gotten it. Very cool.  Wear good shoes and don't bring in a big purse or bag. I got achy from walking and standing with a totes small um, tote.
