One of the best Sunday afternoons I've had in a while....  My first judgement was wrong about this place. Being tucked away in newer buildings behind a starbucks, with kind of a goofy name for a lunch market, I was pretty sure this place was going to be a big disappointment.  WRONG (yay)  Though a confusing layout/way of doing things, the small but impressive market of cheeses, meats, pastas, beverages, teas, coffees, sauces and little do-dads is cute cozy and inviting.  The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines, though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar.    Workers were a little awkward at times but really helpful in making selections.  We opted for a sandwich and a cheese platter for two, accompanied by a bottle of Reisling.  The sandwich was really good and fresh, the sun dried tomatoes were awesome - though as a sandwich in whole i've had better.  The make your own cheese platter was AWESOME-you get to choose as many cheeses as you'd like, getting the chance to look through them and read descriptions and touch, great for someone like me who loves a good cheese but knows nilch about names and pairings.  It was fresh, BIG, and simple-A in my book.   The owners son was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us select the right bottle of wine to go with our cheeses, a not easy task being I like sweeter whites while he likes dry crisp ones.  Though not the best wine i've had, we got a very good bottle for 15 bucks that was enjoyable.   As far as seating goes they have multiple areas inside and out, we very much enjoyed the front outdoor patio with sun covers, live music, grass, and the dog and children friendly atmosphere.   Only downsides I'd have to say would be the confusing layout with lack of direction, and the sometimes "airy" staff behind the counters.  But all in all though we had a great time and will definitely be going again soon.

I love this joint... Postino has become one of my favorite places to grab a bite.  The bruchetta is probably the best I've had in this area next to Armitage, and the size is amazing for the buck.  Out of 10 or so you can choose 4 (fav's are the pepper and goat cheese, the fig and the seasonal), coming out on huge pieces of foccacia cut into fours so you get to keep taking delicious nibbles of each.  Their wine selection is pretty good too, I've fallen in love with the Acadia white that I cant seem to find anywhere else.    Though well priced for the most part, you do have to watch your tab - you can leave with a 30 buck tab up to a 150 tab for two people.   Only negitives I'd say would be the seating, particularly the outside, where they absolutely CRAM you in to the point you might be uncomfortable if you dont like snuggling with your neighbor.  Its great for dates, great place to impress out of towners, and just a great gem of Scottsdale.

Ok... i'm not getting the hype.  The problem I had was that with everything good, came something bad.   - Menu: huge selection of basic mom-pop italian food.  The pizza is definitely the highlight, Problem was that it was too huge, including the goofy oversized menu that hit my partner in the head all the way across the table. -Pricing: pretty good. some things were high, some were low, but all in all i have to say pretty darn good for the portions. -Portions:  We had the garlic cheese bread, awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer, to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza!  The pizza, as well, was HUGEEE (we got the chicago style - DO NOT get appetizers if you are getting a chicago style because you WILL NOT finish it, or even come close, be happy with pizza for the next week).  On the other hand, we also got the "zany zitti" which was... well pathetic.  Small and unsatisfying, served in a bread bowl, and i mean cmon how many carbs can one person have???  The flavors were boring as well - not something i would ever recommend, being i've made better at home from a box. -Flavors: Not bad, but not special.  not surprising - so in my opinion, therefore not interesting.  All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza, i'd be ok with it, but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night.

Simple and short - cant beat a place that brews its own beer.  The Scottsdale location is great, usually really quiet with good service, and they have pretty good food for a bar.  Fish and chips are surprisingly really good, so are the chicken fingers (I'm sorry I like late night finger food)  Their beers are great with a great selecion, from chocolates to very hoppy to wheaty to heffs to the oh so yummy AZ peach.  Also, you can take home big jugs with fresh tap beer if you want for a pretty good price, always good if you're lookin to continue your good time at home

Thank you yelp to introducing me to my favorite unique sandwich spot!  Wildflower is a cute chain, very much like panera bread, incorperating the norm with fun and funky but warm flavors.  With a great range of bread choices, different mustards and cheeses, toppings and combos and sides, its hard to not find a sandwich you will love.    Though I've had a lot of different things here, my absolute FAVORITE sandwich in this world is the BLT plus.  Do me a favor - do the BLT plus, switch brie for cheddar, and add cucumber - and you will be sandwich heaven.

I stopped in this hipster spot to talk with an artist about helping me draw up my tat, a half back black and white original piece.  They hooked me up with Matt, who came out and spoke with me.  He seemed to be on the same page as me, and he said he would draw one up with a $40 nonrefundable payment and I could come in the next week and see it.  Well - I came in as scheduled, and he wasnt there!  I came back in 4 MORE TIMES at different times, twice with him telling me he'd be there with it, and nothing.  Being it was a month later and I hadnt seen or heard from this guy OR my 40 dollar tat, I called the shop and asked what the heck was going on and that I wanted my money back.  Yet again, they said they'd leave a message, and no they werent going to give me my deposit back, even though to this day I have yet to see the product of my mulah.   Other than the fact that its decorated all hipster inside, this place is a dump.  Their customer service is atrocious, I didnt find their artists had that much talent after looking through the books, and their piercing selection is sad - I tried to grab a new nose ring on my way out, but they had like 2 to offer that looked pretty shabby.  Not impressed.  To note - I had a friend who got a tat here, she said they hurried through it, weren't thorough, and just did a really crappy job (she's covered with tats head to toe so I trust her word) - she got it redone last fall by a different shop.

No.  The first night I went there was 30-thousand dollar millionaire look-at-my-new-haircut night, with specials for check-out-my-new-poof f*ck you i'm hot girls.    Seriously - this place is too cool for itself.  Though the bartender made us some bomb shooters, they were 8 bucks a piece!  Also, I really dont come to a downtown bar to see little skanks wearing "catholic school" outfits serving overpriced drinks to the wanna be hot guys only, completely ignoring us chicks.  No thanks

I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.   When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.  Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.    And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!

Not pleased.   Yes, they have good portions.  Yes, its cool they deliver and are open til 930 every night.  Yes, the receptionist can speak English, which is not a prejudice comment, just a general fact after calling literally 7 Chinese restaurants who could not understand a single word i was saying.   But the food that I received was sub-par.  It just didn't have any flavor!  The pot stickers were way overdone and oh too crunchy on the outside with very little filling on the inside.  The lo mien noodles were...awkward.  Half were bunched together , some were overcooked, some were undercooked; the veggies were waxxy and the beef in it was overcooked and under seasoned.  Seriously you messed up lo mien???  The generals chicken was just OK, not horrible but I've had better.    All in all a poor experience, so bad I didn't even bother with the leftovers, which is usually my favorite part of a good Chinese meal!

New(er) to town, we had to take a chance on picking a chinese place on a lazy saturday night.  we got the number and menu from the phone book, and yelped it in our usual style to see that it was good news.    we got crab wontons, chicken chow mein, pu pu platters, and sesame chicken.  wantons and chow mein - A + - really good and impressive for to-go Chinese.  the pu pu platter was good, but surprisingly small.  the sesame chicken was just odd, delicious, but odd - with the runny funny sauce being put on the side - this with no explanation from the hostess chick.  no fortune cookies - wtf mate? - had to ask for soy sauce with an order of white rice to get two little packets (sad).  but littler things, in comparison to the well portioned, fresh tasting, yummy as heck Chinese places I've had in a while, does not compare.  I'd only mention to watch out for the front hostess/pick up girl - she just seemed overwhelmed and lacked focus; after watching her mess up one order, deliver the guy's who'd order had been messed up the last, mix up two different parties and question our phone number 3 times - we were sure to check our food and ask 3 more times for extra soy sauce.    Sum it - good Chinese food for a good price (15-25 per person) not too far away, and really good as leftovers!!!

Ok just to preface - if you are going to pizzeria bianco, you better know you are going for the experience not just the food.  But for the record, the food - is AMAZING.  Be prepared.... Yes, the wait is long.  Yea, on a Wednesday, you probably dont want to be waiting 2+ hours for a 14 dollar pizza.  But you have to respect why its this long wait exists - Chris Bianco single-handedly makes EVERY SINGLE PIZZA FRESH TO ORDER.  BY HIMSELF.    The wait is made far less worse by hitting up his 3rd business directly next door, Bar Bianco.  Its reasonably priced with 8 bucks a glass - ps you must try the moscato, its sweet but amazing.  The ambiance is calm and relaxing, just sit back with a cheese plate and a glass and enjoy.   So accept it.  This man knows what he's doing - his flavors are fresh, unique, and individual.  Portions are perfect, prices are very reasonable (14 av. per pizza)  very decent wine and beer selection.  There is no dessert, but trust that you wont need it!  If you live in Phoenix, you like fresh food, you WILL love bianco's greatness.

Here's the issue with Daphne's - most days I'd give this place 5 stars, but others a measly 2 or 3.   When they are good they are surprisingly really good!  The service has always been friendly and quick, the veggies fresh and crunchy, and always consistent on sizes.  Their prices are excellent, ranging from 6-8 for lunch and 8-10 for dinner.  You cant beat their $1 menu either, with delicious hummus and baklava.    The only bad part about it which would lead me to their 2 or 3 star days would be select servings of meat I've had... Normally, the lamb is wonderfully flavorful, hot and fresh.  However, if you go at a not so busy time and don't request it, they sometimes forget to shave the outside of the meat off that's been cooking on the rotisserie for hours, resulting in dry, burnt, undesirable meat.  My last point is probably unfair and extremely biased, but they serve pepsi instead of coke, and I am a diet coke addict.  I warned ya.

Beautiful decor.  And thats it.  This place is absolutely worthless. I thought the food was horrible; their "renditions" on classics like the chile relleno just ended up as awkward sloppy looking things on my place that just flat out sucked. The waitress checked on us once maybe the whole night.  But, when I do finally get her to ask for some sour creme for the last 3 now bites of my meal, I get this HUGE glob and unknowingly get charged 2 bucks for it!!    For TWO PEOPLE - two entres, and two drinks nothing more - 80 BUCKS.  RIDICULOUS!   Will never go there again, would not recommend anyone going there ever or again, way too cool for school.

Best things about Chipotle:  its cheap (under 8 bucks), its fresh, fast, and has ridiculously awesome guac, and they're consistent.   I'm not gunna lie - though not exactly "mexican" food, they have great food and one of my favorite burritos anywhere.  This location is one of the best I've been to, as the food is awesomely fresh and hot and the wait is small.  It also has a lot of seating, both inside and out, but the backs are wicked uncomfortable in the benches.  The rest of the "ambiance" is pretty normal and not exciting.   The sizes are huge, from burrito to salads.  The chicken is moist and flavorful, the steak is good and not overcooked, and you have different options for beans (even though I dont eat them).  I love their white lime-cilantro rice, the sour creme is not bitter, they have a great pico, and I have a love of the cheese they have.  My favorite things here are the burritos and taco bowls - with LOTS of guac - with chips and guac on the side, topped with their yummy house lime-salt. Also, they serve Coke products here, a big plus to us diet coke fiends.    If you like big burritos and americanized mexican food, you've gotta do yourself the favor of checkin this place out.

Living in Scottsdale by 101 gives a gal limited late night options.  I never thought I could say this about a chain, but this has become one of my favorite late night spots.  The food is always good, fresh, hot, and consistent.  They have a great beer selection with really good prices, and a great full bar with knowledgeable bartenders. Almost every night of the week they have a deal of some kind going on, making a great bang for the buck.  Its never super full which is a plus for me, except for UFC nights, when i just stay the heck away...oooohhhh affliction.   The food has its pluses and its minuses, though.  You cant beat their sauce selection - bests would be the Asian zing, mango habenero (both are hot!) , and spicy garlic.  You can try whichever sauce you want, can modify everything, and change things up with sauces IE 10 wings but 3 with this, 2 with that, and 5 with whatever, and they never complain or question. Everything is made fresh and has always come out hot, and the portions are good sized. My favorite dishes would be the buffalo chicken wrap, their chicken sliders, and of course, the wings.    But the good comes with the bad, and the bad in this case would be the sizes of the wings, both boneless and not.  They are simply not that impressive, so you definitely have to order more to fill up. Also, the boneless have just a bit too much fried breading on the outside and are more nibblet size rather than tenders.    This doesn't keep me from coming back though, especially being addicted to their late night trivia game - which to note, can become a really fun drinking game with your buddies.  I have to give it up to the waiters and bartenders that work here and make this place as great as it is, who are all friendly, down to earth and personal as hell.  Love ya Erin and Chad!

This place a a jewel of Phoenix.  It is one of the most unique, delicious, good ol' fashion home made cooking that will leave you begging for more.    As a small literal hole in the wall in a strip mall, you would never notice it if you didnt already know it was there.  We found this great place thanks to yelp, and decided to give it a shot.  The ambiance is fantastic; small, intimate, and classic with the painted cement floors and dark walls, it reminds me of New York back alley taverns.   The first night we went was absolutely PACKED full, but we still only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table crouched cutely in the back.  Our server was personable, and after going there a few more times I can say the whole staff is spot on.    Now to the menu.  Great beer selection at great prices always adds a star for me.  But that is simply the prequel to the awesomeness that awaits you with the food.  I have had other food but the pasties here - the pasta salad is delicious, good strong greek salad too - but its useless to try to compare it to the pasties.  They have every combination imaginable, from the hearty shepards pie and the oogie to culture fusions like the cajun, the mexican, and one of my favorites, the lamb vindaloo.  You would never think that these ingredients could be packed into a puff pastry and come out incredibly delicious, but it seems to be more of a delightful delectable experience every time I go.    Their desserts are so good too, last time getting the Banoffee pie to go, which was sinful it was so good.  One of the best perks about this place though, is that you can bring any 1/2 cooked pasty home with you - it just takes 10 minutes in the oven - and tada you have awesomeness on hand at home anytime you want.... something i definitely recommend!  Yet again, thank you yelp for a favorite of Phoenix, and if you havent been here yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor!

Don't worry Gabi!  I'm here to rescue you from being the only awkward one on this page - men, just stop reading now.    When that time of the month came - no, not THAT time of the month - the time to go lay on a table and have scolding hot wax smeared on your hootchie to be violently ripped off by a tiny Vietnamese woman with such force you thought she was Chuck Norris. I opted for a recommendation from Queen Gabi to avoid the disappointment and pain I've experienced with too many waxers.  They kindly took me as a walk in even though they were close to closing.  The woman led me to the back, asked me to get ready and she'd be right back in.  "Right back" seemed to be a loose term here, because I was left sitting on a table with no pants on for almost 15 minutes!  Normally this would be a big no-go for me,  but her demeanor and skills made up for it later.  She was very sweet, thorough, and gentle - well as gentle as you can be in this situation - and did her best to lower my level of awkwardness while holding my leg over my head Chuck Norrising my downtown.  She is good stuff though, as i left with very little redness or swelling and smooth as a baby's bottom in 20 minutes.     She followed up with my eyebrows, doing another amazing job by not overdooing it or ruining my more natural shape, again with very little redness or swelling.  The whole thing cost $50 which is pretty damn good, and after tipping my new found wax ripping friend generously, I walked out smooth and happy as a clam.  I would DEFINITELY recommend anyone in waxing-need to head over here as they do a truly awesome job.

Thank you god for blessing me with this whole foods a block away from my house.   The food is amazing, fresh, yummy, healthy (most of it) and just awesome.  The kitchen area has hot food, premade food to go, a ridiculous salad bar with awesome pasta salads, the sushi is surprisingly fresh and really well priced too!!!  Their sandwiches are simply orgasmic.  They also have fresh pizza, taco bar, and bakery.  We've also gone to the Thursday tasting at the wine bar - yes, this grocery store has a wine bar - and had an absolute blast for 10 bucks.  With candles and ambiance you forget you're even in a grocery store!  Cheese selection is great and the person working the counter usually knows all about the cheeses and how to point you in the right direction.  The beverage selection is awesome, from water to wine to beer.   To top it all off, the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful - they make shopping there a glorious experience.  When grocery shopping though, watch the prices - some things are amazingly well priced (go for the 365 brand) while others are simply absurd.   Heads up on the construction going on Scottsdale road right now - it can make it a pain to get in and out.

Seriously?  Who likes this chain bs quality crap?  I like myself a badass sandwich.  This place DOES NOT have it.  Inadequate portions, inadequate food, un-personable service and tacky typical "bread/bakery co" atmosphere.  I've now been over 5 times since i moved here 4 months ago, and not one visit has been satisfactory or fulfilling.  I'm going to wildflower with better portions and flavor or taking a trip to pane bianco.    Dont waste your taste buds.

Good mexican food in a northern scottsdale?  oxymoron.   But seriously, not bad.  Definitely not half as good as the mexican travel trailer stomach-ache-for-weeks food, but certainly better quality.  To start, our server was absolutely fantastic, bringing chips and salsa right away and making great suggestions.  Being new to the joint, we had no idea what to order with the humongous menu, so he kindly pointed us in the right direction.   Pretty good (and pretty strong :):):)  margaritas to start with, though i'd opt next time for rocks vs frozen (super icy - good if thats your style).  My guy took our waiters word and got the pollo fundito --- AMAZING.  ridiculous flavor but not overdone at all, certainly would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I unfortunately was indecisive as usual, so i went for the choose two, going with the steak tacos and chicken flautas.  Pretty good, pretty fresh, but honestly nothing super special and kinda lacked in flavor.    Good portions, fresh food, great service, and comfortable atmosphere.  I'll be goijng back, but i'll be sticking to the specials.

OOoooo no.   I love these salad joints, able to make a salad EXACTLY how i want it (and i'm quite picky when it comes to my leafy goodness) So frankly, when i'm the chef, how could you possibly mess this up??????  Well, when it takes 20 minutes in a completely empty restaurant on a Thursday at 3pm to make a salad, my patience gets a little thin.  I go up to ask the guy when the food might be ready, and he totally blows me off, waving his hand in dismissal.  After another 5 minutes we finally got our crepe salads.  The crepe was dry, cold, and tasted like paper;  the salad was weak, with too few ingredients and overdressed to boot.  And served with sun chips...sun chips?  Seriously?  I mean I like them quite a lot but what the heck are they doing on my plate with a crepe salad at a restaurant????  I will not be going back, and I would not recommend anyone else giving it a shot.  Disappointing and boring just about sums it up.

Awesome awesome awesome.    Great beverage selection, good wines and cheese, adorable market with diverse delicious do dads, and friendly service make this place a must go.  The salad and sandwiches are fresh filled with unique ingredients like their Cabernet glazed onions... leading up to my most prized kitchen addition - the Napa Valley sandwich.  Herbed mayo on sourdough with the Cabernet onions, turkey, blue cheese, and field greens holy mother you will be as pleased as an Irishman with a Guinness that you got this ridiculously awesome kitchen concoction.   I havent been for dinner here yet, but if its anything as good as my market lunch experience, I am sure to be a happy camper.

My guy is a big fan of the not-so-chainish-chain, so we went to check out the new location in Scottsdale on opening night.  Thinking it would be busy up til the late hours, we went at 945 and it was empty, leaving us to be that awkward couple left in the restaurant.   The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a great tuscan feel and beautiful draping curtains everywhere; the dining room it a bit odd, however, being just big and open and THERE.  Our server was awesome, ensuring us that we were totally welcome to enjoy and take our sweet time.  Though the wine took forever to get to us, the bruchetta came out quick and was DELICIOUS - get the quattro, thats all I have to say.  Caeser was just ok.    Pat ordered the Chicken Alla Sorrentina, which though he thought was only ok, I thought was fresh, flavorful, and wicked tasty.  I got the Penne Mediterranean - I had asked for extra tomato and onion; the server made a mistake and it had none rather than extra.  I pointed it out, and the server brought it out - stone cold straight from the fridge.  When mixed into the pasta, it was basically pure tasteless 1/2 hot 1/2 cold crap.  I told the server it was no bueno, and he sent the manager over immediately.  Before I could say anything, she opened with "I heard your dinner was unsuccessful and unsatisfactory - I wanted you to know your entire dinner is on us" and continued to offer to fix my meal or let me order whatever else I wanted!!!  That kind of customer service is rare and hard to find, and though this is not what I would expect every night at this restaurant (it was opening night after all) I was extremely impressed with the type of restaurant they were trying to establish.    I will definitely be going back again not just for the customer service, but for the satisfying fair priced well cooked food.  Cheers.

I have officially found my new favorite pizza place in this world.  I'm not huge on pizza most of the time because my stomach doesnt handle all the grease very well, so when I'm handed a pizza thats loaded with toppings and cheese and doesn't come out with that extra 10 pounds of dripping lard on top, I'm a thoroughly pleased little camper.    With multiple locations and online ordering, tons of topping, cheeses, bread and sauce options, this place makes it easy to get a good pie.  Its good to know beforehand that this is not a New York style pizza joint, but more of your artsy eclectic CPK type with fresh flavorful toppings and out-of-the-box combinations.  Gotta haves are the carmelized onions and the sun dried tomatoes, and the feta on top was really good too.  In my opinion, this is as close to perfection as it comes with this style of pizza. They are little on the pricey side, but it was well worth it.  I will be going back here for sure, this time getting a large instead of medium to have more cold pizza leftover awesomeness for later!
