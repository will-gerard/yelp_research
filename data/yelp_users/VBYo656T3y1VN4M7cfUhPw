I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.

I think this hospital has improved in leaps and bounds. The parking still sucks here and gets worse with the snowbirds. Love that they installed solar but they still don't have them hooked up yet to generate electricity. They are getting better with service but like all hospitals avoid the emergency room as much as possible.

I am surprised at the reviews for this place. I thought it was a lovely family owned and operated business with quick and courteous customer service.  They got together a great bouquet I personally selected.  The store is wonderful to look around and we had a great time picking out something for a birthday.  I thought they were wonderful.  Enjoyed my time here.

My husband had used them for family situations and they are an excellent firm. Very established in downtown Phoenix and wonderful people who work there. Helped resolve many issues and recommendations for this firm is very high.

I saw the reviews from Yelpers and figured this would be the best place to take care of resizing my Christmas gift, a watch. We went in and within 3-4 minutes he was done with the resize. Amazing job. At $14 for the resize, he was amazing. The jewelry there was gorgeous but my husband saw his dream watch. He is addicted to Suunto watches but he found a Citizen watch that we could not pass up. So in love with this place and I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs their jewelry needs taken care of. Professional and extremely helpful.

I enjoyed my meal here. Very nice and friendly staff, courteous manager that was very attentive to the customers and his staff, and clean dining room. Lastly, we went at an off time (not during main meal hrs; 3 pm) and the food was fresh and not crusted like most others look like when they sit for awhile. Liked much.

I found this place a few months ago and fell in love. The food is great, the atmosphere nice and I enjoy coming back. My favorite is simple, yellow curry chicken, but I have ventured into some of the other dishes. Love it and recommend it.

I don't think I will ever shop for jewelry anywhere else. Bought many pieces here and frequent this store to get my wedding ring cleaned.  Love the selection of jewelry and friendly staff that are highly knowledgeable of precious stones and fine jewelry.  Took my youngest brother here for his wedding set and my older brother for his engagement ring to his wonderful wife. I will say that they are impressive in providing quality. My husband to his father here; he is an amateur lapidary hobbyist; and he bought his wife a new set of wedding rings. I've bought gifts and personal sets here and highly recommend Shane Co.

This seems like a pretty hip place to hang out, grab a drink and people watch. So busy every time I come here and the parking is not too bad. A casual hangout and lots of groups come here as a meeting spot. During the weekdays a lot of students are doing homework but all in all, great service and decent place.

I read other reviews and came here to get holiday baked goods. Not a disappointment. Loved the selection of cookies,  pastries,  cakes and pies. We ordered a cake and it was so delicious.  They got it done with short notice and the price was excellent.  Highly recommend this place to anyone who has a sweet tooth.

Found this place while getting pastry next door. Amaze - Balls. So much meat, so little appetite.  We bought some gorgeous steaks here and a few soup bones for the dog. The steak was like butter, not to mention corn fed beef is a lot less calories (if you are watching your figure). So if you want to treat yourself to some amazing steaks but not have to pay restaurant prices, come here.

I love New Balance shoes so it is always nice to see the store is readily available. I just recently got back into exercising and needed a good pair of shoes. Not to mention my podiatrist said I needed good stability to help prevent rolling. Found the perfect shoes here. Stabilizers, comfortable, and more importantly, in Wide sizes.  My only negative is the limited selections for wide sizes. I went back 6 months later to replace my favorite shoes that were worn and they no longer carried that specific style in wide. I was pretty sad. Otherwise, great store.

So I really enjoy this pet store. Good location, easy parking, quick service and the always have pet food companies here to promote their products and have great sales. My dog enjoys coming here but hates going near the groomers. Great selection for pets and very well kept store. These workers are very helpful here too.

It lost 1 star only because the parking lot can be horrendous at certain times. Also, I wish they had a car wash here like at the other one on Bell. Though the gas station is always busy since it is right next to the freeway. Great service here and always pretty well stocked. It is very conveniently located and I forgot to mention the propane refill here as well... For those RV's.

I had to mail my books back to school and the service was amazing. They got my shipping label printed and all I had to buy was a $2 package. I've come here on several occasions for copies, printing, etc. and enjoy the well kept facility. Right off the access road and easy parking. Great place to get all my shipping and printing needs taken care.

This is one of the worst McD's around. They are slow service, back up easily, half the time screw up the order and some crew members are pretty rude (considering what their job is to serve). Not to mention they have the open late sign but constantly shut down early at night. Forget the late night ice cream run... Wawawahhhh!

I don't understand some of these bad reviews. I found this place from Groupon and adore the fact that this is a small, cute, corner business that is cozy and friendly. The nail service I received was very good. The chatter was a bit loud but it was because it was the bustle of holiday shopping. Very quaint little place with locals who enjoy the services they provide.

The lunch menu is reasonably price with many selections of sandwiches and salads. For the more carnivorous ones there are a few to select on meat entr√©es. The place was a little dark for my aunt but luckily all cell phones come with lights.  Bread with butter, and some vegetables (leeks, endive or something of the sort) was there to try. I had the pork chop which was delicious. Both guest had sandwiches (french dip & open faced steak) they rather enjoyed. Overall nice experience and a good birthday lunch.

I was a huge fan of Borders but since they closed I am left to succumb to B&N. I will not complain though since I can get my latte and read. They have great kids events here and many nonprofit org. Come here. The store doesn't always have what I am looking for but they are helpful and willing to quickly order it. I like this location too.

They have a Starbucks in here. Love it. These facilities are always clean, the selections of everything are great and their sales are pretty amazing. I feel like Albertson's gets over-shadowed by other grocers but they are a wonderful place to shop at. I also like that their kitchen appliances and gadgets are at great prices. Love this place.

Do not expect service to be expedited if you walk in to take out. The food is good but the service in house and take out are lacking. For a steak house it is mediocre at best. They do have great value dinners if you are on a budget but it is not my first choice for steak house. The last time here, I think the host had never taken a to go order before and was unsure of how to go about doing such a task.

So my husband needed to find a new place to get his hair cut. He likes the atmosphere, pricing, and service here. They sell an array of hair products to keep your man looking gorgeous. I enjoy knowing that the owners are a huge supporter for veterans as well. Hair cut, wash, and style at a great price and frequent shoppers get great pricing as well.

If I could give a No Star I would give it to them. The food was cold, the service sucked, ( drive thru ) personnel had big attitude as if I was inconveniencing their "chill" time, and they gave me attitude for speaking proper English and them not understanding it. So I will never go back to this KFC.

I really enjoy the food here. Probably one of the best layouts for a fast food but it feels more homey than any fast food. The service is very hands on, extremely well maintained facility, the best playroom ever and the food is great. If you watch your diet, the salads are great. I am willing to pay a higher price for food when the service and product is his good.

It's tucked away in the far end of the building but is quite an enjoyable place to eat. I had the BBQ chicken that was excellent. The curry is quite good. The dessert was definitely my favorite with the banana medallions. So delicious and quick friendly service. I love Thai food and this place hits the spot.

I am trying to leave this bank due to personal issues with the way my mortgage and reconstruction from flooding was handled.  Worst customer service for home finances and don't expect any help in getting resolution for financial questions in this department.  Not per say this branch but all the company as a whole. I do like the polite staff at this branch. Planning to move funds soon.

First time there and enjoyed the food immensely. Had the brisket plate at lunch and the place was packed. Lots of local workers come her to grab a quick lunch and they were in and out in a matter of minutes. The brisket plate was delicious and I had cole slaw with macaroni salad. Both sides were very fresh and good eats. My husband had the cornbread which was excellent in the muffin form. Great portions, good selections, and excellent food. Their sauces are delicious as well. Highly recommend this BBQ joint for everyone.

My friends at the Anytime Fitness told me to check it out. So one day I ventured here after a workout and what can I say...I am hooked.  Love the airy atmosphere,  beautiful holiday decor, so many areas to sit, choices galore for drinks, food looks delicious and the price is nice. $4. & change gets you a 24 oz latte and its so good. Live bands too... amazing.  A new addiction.

So my friend from school told me about this place. Pretty amazing groomers. Ask for Rachel. She is so awesome. The price is better than any Pet Smart and your animal will not shriek in terror while there. They have Groupon discounts if you are on a budget. They also have self-service washing. Pretty neat. Also, so many foods, treats, goodies, toys, harnesses, etc for your pet that you will be amazed. I have never seen my dog's hair cut so well and she was absolutely in love with Rachel. The best price with the best service I have ever bought for my pet. Love it and highly recommend anyone to bring their pet here.

Always love coming here for the great food, great family atmosphere and the wonderful staff. Been coming here since they opened their doors. Way better food and especially prices than L&L or Ono Hawaiian. My kids eat up the musubi (spam, rice, nori) and the Mac salad is ohh so good. I always bring family here when they are in town for some good island food. If you know a good easy recipe, just ask them and they just might add it to the menu. I keep meaning to get them the recipe for lau lau and crispy gau gee but I keep forgetting to bring it in. My favorite is the Katsu, curry, and ribs (so good). Take homes include musubi, Mac salad, and my daughter's favorite is egg drop soup (you have to ask special for this item).

I joined this gym 2 months ago with a goal in mind:   Get off the couch and lose some fricken weight.(I am on a strict diet plan) The results are: 38 lbs. less and I have 32 more to go.  -Sign up was super easy, no hassle & $35 a mo. By myself. -3 free personal trainer sessions that can be used whenever (haven't use mine yet) but they teach you a routine and you can stick to it or do your own thing. -I can go to the gym whenever I have time and do my own thing without being judged or looked at as "someone who doesn't belong there." - the upstairs allows you to do floor exercises, with weights or on an exercise ball routines -they are getting a new on demand workout machine so you can select your specific type of exercises and go for it. The staff is incredibly helpful and easy to approach and ask questions about equipment use, upcoming events or just have someone to talk to about health and fitness. (Brad is pretty awesome)  -Best feature is the available classes; Zumba (I go to all except Wed. Because of school) Kickboxing (this is a real intense workout but worth it) Boot Camp (love it, really difficult, but you go at your pace) Hopefully we will get PiYo back.  -The showers and bathrooms are always clean and well stocked by management -Individual television screens on the elliptical, bikes, stair climbers and treadmills so bring you headphones. (The nice thing is if you forget your stuff, ie. towel, bottle, headphones, no one steals it and its probably on the front desk waiting for you)  The convenience and location of this gym is fantastic. The other gym members are really personable, willing to welcome, and help motivate you to get moving. The instructors are well versed in their routines, incredibly pleasant to exercise with, and have made huge impacts on many people's lives by being supportive and motivating.   I definitely would suggest this gym to anyone and recommend it to others often.

Due to unfortunate events at this gym, I am highly disappointed in the unprofessional goings on that have occurred here.

Thanks for the memories and great friends but I am disappointed that one of the best trainers is leaving here.

I had a craving for good BBQ and this was a disappointment. Ordered $35 worth of food and did not enjoy most of it. The pulled pork was okay. The brisket was mediocre. The chicken was okay. The beans were under cooked and pretty bad. Threw that away. The sauces were decent. I just ended up asking my father in law to make some brisket since I couldn't find anyone to buy some good southern style brisket.   The staff was extremely nice and the place is really clean. Inside and a little outside seating. The portions were really small though so I was not impressed.

I went to get some waxing done before the holidays. I fell in love with this place. I don't care for the pain of waxed hair getting ripped from my skin but the staff is so professional and wonderful. They have great packages that are amazing if you prefer to go more frequently and wonderful supplemental supplies to maintain that sexy clean look. Would I recommend this place... Of course I would tell all my friends and family to go here. Best prices, and they are well trained for the job at hand.

I like this store but getting to it is kind of difficult.  Use the stop light or come from Greenway for easier access. The store is very clean, organized,  and well stocked; especially on the weekends for busy shoppers.  Lots of great produce to choose from but I was mostly just disappointed in the fact that their produce was mainly from Mexico. For a health store I would hope to find more US product and GMO-free foods. Otherwise the breads are delicious and enjoyed my shopping trip.

Loved this place. It was our first time there and I am not really a pizza fan but this place was easy, quick, delicious and very well priced. Personally made pizzas to order and built how you want it. Less $8/ 11inch personal thin crust pizza... It can't be beat. So many choices for toppings and great service. The website said it was closed on Sunday but it was open. Hopefully that was changed. So definitely try this place.
