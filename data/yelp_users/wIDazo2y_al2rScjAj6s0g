We eat breakfast here all the time. Love the machaca burrito and the cinnamon chips. Any of the Mexican breakfast items are delicious. I am actually surprised at some of these reviews. Never had a bad experience here.

The code blue roll and spicy salmon are my favorites. Can't beat the happy hour! This is one of our all time favorite sushi places to go.

We used to love this place. Last couple of times we ordered the meat was slimy and undercooked. Very nice people that work there but the place has been taking a turn lately.

I just recently moved to chandler and I was worried about finding a new groomer for my half Maltese and half American Eskimo puppy. Prestige came recommended by a friend and I am so glad I found them. Everyone is so friendly and you can tell they genuine love their job and the dogs they groom. My dog gets so excited when she sees the salon she practically jumps into the groomers arms. She always comes back perfectly groomed and fluffed! Not to mention she smells amazing!! I can never get her to smell that good when I bathe her. I would recommend this salon to everyone I know with pets! I ll be going here for years to come!!
