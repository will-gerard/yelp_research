Ordered delivery and it got here really fast. Within 15-20 minutes.  Got the pork fried rice and it was pretty good. Generous portions and reasonable prices.

Came here a couple years ago with my cousin for his haircut; so it was the first place that came to mind that was nearby when I needed my own cut.  Was around Noon on a weekday when I walked in and was able to sit right down and get things going. Marina asked me what I wanted and got right to it. It turned out very well.  I really enjoyed the foam and straight razor to trim the neck and sides. The little massage at the end was pretty great as well.  I've been shaving my own head for about 10-13 years. If I continue to keep the hair growing, I'll definitely be coming back.

There's people asking for change almost every time we go. They'll even comb through the parking lot and try to catch you there. The front pillars block the field of view for both pedestrians and drivers. Always feels like an accident waiting to happen. We enjoy shopping at Fry's but I think we'll just start going to 67th and Happy Valley location.

Came in and no one was there. Grabbed a few menus ourselves and waited for ~5 minutes before we got up and decided to leave. No hostess, no waiter/waitress, no anyone.

One of the best burgers I've ever had. For sure need to come back and try the B.Y.O.M&C.

Being told 3 times by 3 different employees that you "don't get commission," and still shadowed throughout the store.   Hearing the first one radio in my clothing description over his ear piece.  The place has a huge selection of nice, but expensive, things. But everyone working there felt like a robot. I've felt less hassled at a car dealership; no joke.  We did actually purchase something though. A dinning room table set in clearance. Everything about it was totally fine. Very good price for a table and 4 chairs.  Biggest issue is the customer service. Place gave me the creeps.

This is the greatest place you could ever hope to live. Not a single problem and everyone is so helpful! Lots of colorful and pleasant people. You're in safe hands with The Place at Santana. :)  There's even covered, assigned parking! Wow!
