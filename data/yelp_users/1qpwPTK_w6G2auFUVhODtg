This restaurant is great.  Good food, fair prices, great service.  Mongollian Beef is my current favorite dish, but I'm steadily working through the entire menu.  Last time I tried the Schezwan Shrimp.  It was good, but not spicy enough for my taste.

Still great food, I have tried many of the menu items.  My favorite is the "Triple Delicacy"; it is basically the Mongolian Beef with chicken and shrimp included.    I have them add broccoli and carrots to mine.  Delicious!

This is the best Asian Buffet by far.  They even have prime rib and crab legs on the weekend.  My only complaint, make sure you get there well before anytime close to closing.  When they are close to closing time, they don't fill the buffet with much new food.

I don't think that I can add much to the already posted reviews, but here goes.  GC is definitely the Walmart of music stores.  It's OK in a pinch, but you wouldn't want it as your mainstay music store.  Support the small shops whenever you can.  The one good thing about GC is the reason you don't really want to shop there, their return policy.  they'll take anything back.  Keep that in mind when you are buying something "new" there.  Also, there are tons of people who don't know what they are doing going in there everyday and kicking the crap out of their gear.  If you buy something high on the wall or out of a glass case, you are probably relatively safe.  Protip:  You can shop online and have stuff shipped to store and pick it up there, you can save a lot of money on shipping.  Protip 2:  GC, GC.com, and Musician's Friend are all THE SAME thing.

I love this venue.  It's large enough for major acts, but it still feels so intimate.  There isn't a bad seat in the house.  The access is easy and the location downtown is good.    I have seen lots of acts here, both music and comedy.  I even have had a chance to sit in the VIP box seats, which are really nice and have a bunch of free amenities.  I will continue to see shows here time and again.

The best bar in the valley to see live music.  The food is good, the drinks are reasonable, and the bands ROCK!

The best place to get a steak, anywhere.  The filet is their signature, and if you have never been, that is what you should order.  It's always perfect.  The sides are also excellent, pick anything.  Dessert too.  This place is expensive, but worth it.

Even if you don't play the guitar, you should go here, just because of the awesomeness. This is the best music store ever. Friendly and helpful staff, talented teachers, and awesome gear. The most knowledgeable folks anywhere and always the best price. The owner is the coolest person I have ever met, period. And as if all this weren't enough, this is simply a cool place to hang out... it feels like home. Sadness is an emotion reserved only for people who don't shop at McKnight.

Still awesome, and Yelp is still filtering my reviews for whatever reason.  What is the point of filtering reviews if you can still see all the reviews that were filtered?

Wendy's has the worst food of almost any fast food restaurant.  Their fries used to be good, but not so much anymore.  Their burgers are overly salty, their breakfast is terrible.  The Frosty is the only edible thing there.  Yuck.

Definitely the friendliest DZ around, this place is fun fun FUN.  If you want to do a tandem, this is the place to go, the feeling is laid back but the staff is very professional and safe.  I have been dying to comple my AFF but just haven't been able to set aside a couple months where I can jump every weekend, which is my plan.  If you've never been skydiving, you are missing out on life.

This place is awesome!  The food is fantastic.  I really like the tri-tip sandwich, but you can't go wrong with anything here.  Everything about this place i superior to Rudy's next door, the food is 10x better, the seating is better, the serving line, the way beverages are served, everything.

Nowhere near as good as Can't Stop Smokin', which is next door.  I have only been once and have never been back.  The pulled pork sandwich was awful, I don't know what sauce they use but it tastes terrible.  The sides weren't very good either and they gave me sandwich bread instead of a BBQ bun.  Also, only bottled drinks?  I don't get it.  Go next door instead.

We eat here at least twice a week, my friends and I may have a problem...  You only need to know two words:  Louisiana.  Rub.  That is all.

This is the closest thing to NOLA you will find in this city.  Everything they serve is good, the catfish, the etoufee, gumbo, jambalaya, you name it.  The lunch specials are fantastic, try the seafood enchiladas on Tuesday.  I can't believe I'm going to post this here because I don't like competition when it comes ot getting my order (they run out), but they have a crawfish boil on Wednesday night, it is AWESOME.  I have friends who are from LA and they swear by this place.  I am new but a dedicated fan.  If you don't like this place, you probably don't like this kind of food or you are just a weirdo.  Anyone who gave it less than 4 stars must be from the 70s because they are on ludes.
