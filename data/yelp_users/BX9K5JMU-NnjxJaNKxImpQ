This place is gross. There is nothing fresh about this Mexican grill. The corn tortillas were of the crispy pre-folded taco shell variety only, all of the salsa looked and tasted like it came out of a Sysco can, and the lettuce had that spinachy taste that lettuce tends to get about two days after you're supposed to throw it away.   You'll get an infinitely better meal if you go to the Chili's across the parking lot, which is really kind of sad.

This diner is totally ghetto (extra-shabby strip mall, horrible decor, and absolutely zero effort made to be a "nice" place), but I keep going back because their wings are so damn yummy. I think their buffalo sauce is laced with heroin.  A couple of tips:  - Go there with the idea in your head of getting it to go. If you go there with the plan of eating it there, you'll probably change your mind before the food is even ready. - Use the drive-through if nobody else is in it already, otherwise park your car and go inside. They don't take your order until you get to the window (no intercom) and at about 5 minutes/car, you don't want to line up for that.  It should also be said that they don't have a liquor license and it's 100% wrong to serve wings without beer, but I'll overlook that since this is strictly a to-go place for me and I have beer in my fridge.

I hadn't been here for a while, but I just happened to be driving down Alma School and absolutely had to stop.  Anyhow, Doug W.'s review is right on. The place is scary looking and the wings aren't all that meaty, but the sauce on these wings are wowowowow good. It could contain all the trans-fats in the world for all I know and I still wouldn't care.   This is still a strictly to-go place in my book.

I must've come here on a bad day considering all of the other glowing reviews. I've got two things to say about this place:   a) It's very affordable. b) Up until I visited this place, I thought pizza was like sex. That is, there's no such thing as bad sex. Well, the Floridino's pizza just kinda laid there.  I should probably try it again, even though my first visit was underwhelming. One more minor note, this place also has a full bar and it's the first thing you see when you walk into the place. Not sure why that survey question has been answered differently by every other user.

Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.  I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.  With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what?   Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station.

I've been shopping at this Safeway for the better part of 8 years now and say what you want about Fresh & Easy and Trader Joe's, this Safeway is the best damn grocery store out there.  It's just one of those places where you're never asking yourself why they don't call out more cashiers. You're never stuck at the register behind a soccer mom with a full cart and three kids in tow, it's just the frat boy with the 12 pack of beer in one hand and a bag of ramen in the other, or that Indian guy with a few bags of vegetables, and they sail right through. And even if there is the occasional shopper with a full cart paying with an out-of-state check, it's not an issue, because there are 6 other registers open. You don't stand there hopelessly for 10 minutes while they call for a backup cashier over the PA system, because the backup was never hiding in the office to begin with. They were out there the whole time.  Oh, and it's the infamous Hot Chick Safeway. I didn't even realize that it was actually called that until I saw it on Yelp, but it's very true and that would be worth a few stars alone.

Wow. I first ate at Ted's about 7 years ago and absolutely hated it, but I drove by this evening, thought about all of those positive reviews on Yelp, and decided to step inside. It was pretty damn good.  One thing though, if they're going to serve quality hot dogs and bratwursts, they should really offer something better than that yellow French's mustard to put on it. You don't drink a screw-cap wine when you have a good meal, and you shouldn't put that kiddie mustard on a good brat. This place will be strictly 'to go' orders for me, and I'll use the good German mustard in my fridge.

It's an Arby's, food tastes like every other Arby's.   However, the service is consistently good and that's important when you're trying to cram a quick lunch within a half hour break, so they get a few stars from me.  Edit: This outlet didn't honor their nationwide promotion of free curly fries after a Matt Kenseth NASCAR win. The cashier didn't even know who Matt Kenseth is, and made me feel like an idiot trying to collect on a dollar side item. What the crap?

Ugh... This was a pretty disappointing place.  I had a little problem with the Night Splash deal, which is basically admission for nighttime hours at a discounted price. The website says that the Night Splash tickets go on sale at the gate at 6:00PM, so I buy the tickets online earlier in the day, show up to the park at about 6 with my girlfriend and her 8 year-old kid, and they make us stand outside the gate for an hour in the 100+ heat because the Night Splash apparently doesn't start until 7:00PM. I think this place could use an adult presence. None of the employees had any customer skills and when they had 20 different pissed off parties of people who bought tickets online and apparently showed up too early, they still didn't seem to want to admit any problem. But that's what happens when even the senior employees aren't old enough to buy a beer.  Aside from that, the lines for the slides were pretty long and they don't really move people through with any efficiency. They seem to not just wait for the previous person to get out of the pool below the slide, but then clear some painted red line on the concrete before they send the next person down. What the crap? I've been to other waterparks where they just count to 5 or 10 and it seems to work fine. I don't think I could tolerate this place during daytime summer hours.  The whole facility is actually fairly nice and this place would be pretty cool if it was managed better, but for my money, I'll go to the Hilton resort by Squaw Peak. Not only is the staff more service oriented there, but you can also sip on a cocktail while you float around their lazy river tube ride.

I kind of like this place. Very clean, good service. I played it safe with some Teriyaki chicken and their chow mein special (shrimp, chicken, & beef), because my girlfriend and her kid think of Panda Express when they want Chinese food, but I got her to admit this food was better.   Also, for those who care, they don't use MSG.

I have to admit, I was kind of skeptical about this place, but it turned out pretty damn good. It was a Saturday night and the place was completely empty for most of our meal, which usually is a sign that you should run out the door as quickly as you can, but we stuck it out and I had some really really good pork tenderloin. It was a tad on the pricey side and it felt a little creepy being the lone couple in a room that seats 200 people, but the trade-off was some extra-good service.  I'd go back, sure.

I actually live only a few miles away from this place, but every once in a while it's nice to have a change of scenery, not to mention access to a pool with a bar next to it and a bed within crawling distance of a dozen bars. So I found myself at the Mission Palms this weekend. It was a pretty good room, the pool was perfect, the sheets were comfortable, and I can't complain about the location.   However, I can complain about the valet driver that messed with my climate control settings for the 6 second drive to closest parking spot in the whole lot. I don't usually like to give my car to a valet anyway, but the lack of self-park spots made it a necessary evil. The least they could do is leave it the way I fucking like it.

I like this place. The food here is like what you'd get at a typical taco stand in Nogales, but without the dysentery.  The chicken and beef are equally tasty, but I tend to favor the beef because it's boneless and less work trying to get it all into the tortillas.

This place was pretty good to me. I'll just sum the stars up:  (+1) - great tasting pizza (+1) - friendly service (+1) - two slices and a drink for $5.06 (+1) - I pay with a $10 bill, get a $5 bill back, don't need no stinkin' change (+1) - My slices came from a freshly-made pizza, as opposed to the standard reheated shingle (I don't know if that's standard here, but I saw mine get sliced up fresh from the oven)  (-1) - The to-go packaging consisted of my pizza slices on a large (but not large enough) plate, covered with foil & no bag, which doesn't  fucking cut it for someone who likes his car like I do   Update: After a few more visits, I'm gonna give them a 5th star. It's really good stuff.

Mmmm... Chuck Box... Droooool...  So this place looks kind of run down, some of the staff looks a little scary, and there's literally a 1" thick layer of grime on the brick next to the grill that's probably taken 40 years to build up, but damn is it a good burger. This is one of those places where they go out of their way to disgust you and you still come back because the food is so good.

This store is expensive, dirty, and basically a place to walk to when you're too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer.

I think this place gets a bad rap. Sure, it might not have the same charm as Wrigley Field, but the seats are comfortable, the weather will never ruin the game, they use real grass on the field, and the layout is just designed so much better than any old ballpark. You never have to walk very far for a hot dog or a toilet.  Also, let's not kid ourselves about the Suns. In the last 10 years, the Diamondbacks have been the local major sports team with the best chance of winning a championship in any given year.

I've started going here for lunch with a coworker, and we're both hooked enough to go here at least once or twice a week. Everything tastes fresh, the service is great, the staff is friendly, the bathrooms are clean, it's fairly affordable, and I just can't think of any reason to really knock this place.  Edit: After checking out a lot of other sushi establishments, this is still the best one in terms of food quality, service, and value. It's the big kahuna.

I've been a member since the place opened about 2 or 3 years ago, no major complaints. It's cheap (I believe it's $15/month now, $5/month more for tanning), it's open all night during the week, and I've never seen over-subscription as a problem here.   There are some small annoyances like the upright bikes with the recumbent pedals and the occassional elliptical arm that needs to be tightened up, but the equipment is good and generally well-maintained, and you get more than your money's worth.  Also, since they're geared more towards fitness rather than being able to bench press a Volkswagen, you don't get the riff-raff that goes with a place like that.

This was one of the better sushi experiences I've had in Arizona. The pricing is very reasonable, the fish quality was excellent, and they seem to play jazz over the stereo, as opposed to the usual techno in most sushi joints.  It looks like it would be a good lunch place. There's no happy hour, no bar, and the alcohol selection is pretty much limited to beer and hot or cold sake.  By the way, I'm not the greenest person by any means (I'm eating sushi after all), but what's up with that take-out packaging? It seems like an overwhelming amount of styrofoam and plastic bags for the amount of food that was in it.

Everything in my first review still applies, except that "I don't think the paper is a bad product" part. What was I thinking? It seems like it's becoming a thinner paper, relying more on wire stories, and they're probably still losing money. I can't imagine a scenario where I'd ever pay for this paper again.  Oh, and the AZ Central comment leavers are still a bunch of turds.

I went on a- Get ready to lose your lunch. Here it comes... I went on a "staycation" this weekend!  Wow, I feel nauseous just typing that.  Anyhow, I stayed at the Pointe this weekend. So the rooms are pretty good, but this place has one really cool thing going for it. The lazy river ride. There's no better way to spend a July afternoon in Phoenix than sitting in an inner tube and drinking beer.   I did park my car under the wrong tree and I did have to stop at a carwash to blast about 50 bird dookies off my car on the way home, but I won't hold that against them since the trees also give the resort a certain level of charm. Just don't park under any of them.  The rooms are a fairly good value, but expect to get nickle-and-dimed if you want anything more. The restaurants are kind of pricy (and not that good) and it's $12/day if you want to use the internet in the room.

This place is pretty good. My favorite chain sandwich shop, for what it's worth. They offer sourdough, which I guess is too exotic for Subway and Quiznos. I also like the service here. The sandwich makers here are fairly friendly and though I'm sure you can only make so many subs before becoming overly jaded, they don't seem to show it at all.  It's a little pricy too, but it's good stuff.

High points for authenticity. The menu isn't in English, the TV in the dining area was blaring a telenovela, and the girl at the counter gave me a "Do you need directions gringo?" look when I walked in the door.  Good, cheap, tasty food.

This place was kind of gross. I stuck to the floor while I was at the counter ordering some food and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since they opened. This theater has only been open for about a year, but it already has a feel to it that it's been there for about 15 years and is in need of a renovation. All was well once we got inside the theater room, but the lobby/hallway was disgusting.  I do like their policy of not letting small children into R-rated movies after 6PM.

Dare I say it? This is a step up from In-n-Out. The burgers are comparable, the fries are stringier and imho just a little bit better, and they offer a wider menu selection with things like hot dogs, chicken fingers, and many dessert options.

I don't know why they changed the boarding system recently, but I like it. Having small children will no longer get you ahead of my A boarding pass. Good. You can check in early like everyone else if you want a decent seat.  Now if only the stewardesses would give up the whole can of Coke without me having to beg for it...

Pluses: - Dave & Buster's - BevMo! - Finally a Barnes & Noble near my home  Minuses - Horrible traffic flow in the parking lot - Often ridiculous crowds, drawn by ??? There's nothing all that unique within this shopping center.  This place is awfully disappointing, just a complete clusterfuck when you want to attempt a 10 minute errand, and I don't imagine the parking lot will be any better once the Sam's Club opens.

Well, I took a little walk up this hill this morning and thought "this would be a great one to Yelp!", but I don't think I can say anything that wasn't already said (better) in Mr. K's review.  In a nutshell: this is a good hike both for a workout and wonderful views, take the trail on the backside if you want a more private experience, and uh, yeah it's a pretty good hike.  The only thing I might add is that you can also park at the North Mountain visitor center and walk it from there if you want to lengthen your hike by a mile.

I see a lot of reviews stating how bad the service is here, and I suppose ours wasn't perfect as they had some issue with the vegetables back in the kitchen and I didn't get them until I was almost done with my meal.  That said, I thought the food and atmosphere and music in this place was excellent and I'll definitely come back.

This is one of my favorite places to hike in the valley. There are usually hardly any people on the trails, unlike South Mountain or Squaw Peak, and it doesn't feel like you're still within an hour's drive of 4 million people.   There's also an interesting history to the park (there are numerous  Hohokam ruins, an old dude ranch, and a few other stories) and if you ever get the opportunity to take a guided hike with a park ranger, it's worth your time.  $3 per person fee to enter the park (Cave Creek residents exempt)

This place is the cat's ass. It's cheap, the food is pretty good, the service is great, and it's just a good place to watch a game. It is never going to get 3 Michelin stars, but it certainly deserves better than some under-21 year-old vegetarian saying that it's gross. It's a bar that serves cheap tacos, what do you expect?

Since I got back into student mode a couple of weeks ago, I've had a chance to get reacquainted with Orbit. Meh.  Here are some observations: - The homeless drunks still find a way on the bus at 8AM. - Each driver has their own interpretations of where the route goes, which neighborhoods are flag-stops, bus capacity, etc. Those interpretations almost never err on the side of good customer service. - Why so many fuckwads that spend 10 minutes waiting for a bus, only to get off at the next stop? It's a 5 minute walk. Stop slowing the bus down! - The bus capacity is listed as 17 seated + 6 standing, and usually somewhere between 23-30 passengers will be on the bus as it approaches ASU, depending on the mood of the driver. It is never under max capacity. I have seen literally hundreds of people not get picked up over the past two weeks. They could use full-size Valley metro buses and they would still fill up.  So, one star because I can't give it zero, plus one more because it's free. Though you get what you pay for.

This is a pretty good place to go for a hike in the valley. As opposed to the typical Camelback/Piestewa/South Mountain trails, there's little elevation change and the terrain isn't very challenging, but it's a nice trail to have a social walk with a friend and it's situated in such a way that for a good half-hour stretch, you couldn't tell that you're within an hour's drive of 4 million people.   Bonus: the trail system and restrooms are probably the cleanest of any park in the metro Phx area. No broken glass to be found anywhere.

Does this valley need another sub shop? No, it certainly doesn't. This seems to be a family-owned enterprise and the value is maybe just a wee bit better than the national franchises, so maybe it's not the first one I'd drive through if I happened to have a bulldozer at my disposal.  It's still just a sub though, and I thought this particular sandwich was in the style of Blimpie's. The bread is a little bit on the thick side, heavy on the lettuce that looks like it was run through a document shredder, plus a reasonable quantity of meat.

Bleh.   I've tried this place twice now, once for a burger and once for the chicken. I'm not going to say that this place is outright terrible, because it's an edible burger, but aside from being new and still spotless, this place is inferior to it's nearest competitor (the Chuckbox) in almost every way: it costs quite a bit more, the burgers are good but nothing great, the chicken tasted quite good (but a tiny piece of meat on the bun for a $6 sandwich), the fries were garbage, there's no free parking, and it just has nothing special going for it.

This place has had awesome bread since day one. Whatever else you walk out with is just a bonus. Actually, I have to say that the produce selection is getting noticeably better each time I walk in. I still don't think it's quite suitable for everyday shopping, but it's coming along pretty well.

This is a good road trip. Actually, one of the primary reasons people visit Tortilla Flat is that the winding Apache Trail can potentially be a really fun road to take your sports car or motorcycle for a ride, and it's the last place to stop before the pavement ends. You can also find yourself stuck behind a slow truck with a boat trailer for 20 miles, so don't get your hopes up.  The food in the saloon is your basic pub grub (burgers, sandwiches, tacos). It was pretty good, and priced better than one would expect for a tourist trap. The general store is famous for it's prickly pear ice cream, which I'll leave to some other reviewer to describe (the mint chocolate chip was good). There's also an interesting little museum next door, about the size of a garden shed, with a little history of Tortilla Flat as a stagecoach stop.  It's worth checking out.

Bleh. This place looks pretty rough, but it's been here for a long time and I was thinking that the food must be pretty good if it's survived that long. Wrong.  I'd say that at least half of my Hunan chicken & shrimp combo went in the trash. I could've done better with Panda Express and I'll be eating a bowl of Cap'n Crunch in hour or two.   Fortune cookie: Desire, like the atom, is explosive with creative force. In bed.
