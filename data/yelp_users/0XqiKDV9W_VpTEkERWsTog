Oh my very favorite!  Poutine! Not at all like the traditional, but oh-so-good and imo, so much better! Sandwiches served on biscuits?!? Heaven! I only wish this place was open for breakfast.  Oh yes, and service? Top notch!

I can't decide which is worse...the food or the service. Actually, yes I can. The service bites big time. For a table of eight, you'd think you might wanna check back once, maybe even twice. Or at least make eye contact for Pete's sake! As for the food, the Shepherd's pie is a big No! How can you mess up Shepherd's pie? It was similar to Sloppy Joes or Hamburger Helper? Hey, maybe it's Sloppy Joe Hamburger Helper???The Chicken Boxty was not bad with big chunks of bell pepper-yum-but I think I detected a tinny flavor to the chicken. I wonder if they buy Chicken-in-a-Can @ Costco. Seriously??? The waitress STILL is not back!  Okay, I've simmered down since I originally drafted this. The service did suck, the food was okay, but what do we expect from a pseudo Irish bar, anyhow? :)

What the hell is up with the music?!? You can't dance to it, you can't get into it. We went on 7/31 and it just drug the whole night down. I think three people sat and watched the guys playing. Really? You pay for these guys to be here? Even with the bean bag toss and ping pong and all the good things about The Monastery, the music bit big time! Ugh, it makes me not wanna come back anytime soon.

These guys were swift and awesome! They got me in right away and worked on a car that I've had a hard time finding anyone to work on. Much appreciated. They even referred me on to some great people for glass work. Thank you!

I purchased a Groupon for My Arepa and was so excited. I now work in Queen Creek, which is apparently the 'flavor' desert. I could barely decide what to try here w/all the different tastes! I settled on the Shredded Beef Patac√≥n-I loved that it was on plaintains! The Arepa Reina Pepiada-good and solid, and the Hamon Pepiada, basically just slices of folded ham-kinda plain for my tastes, but still solid. Of course, I loved that these were corn meal instead of the same old bun! Oh, I didn't add the pink sauce onto the shredded beef-it reminded me of Thousand Island dressing, but maybe I will next time. Also, there's mention of 'very nice people'. That's def true. I met Juan-good guy-he even shook my hand, twice! I'll go back. Actually, I have to-they forgot my custard pie in my take-out order. Major disappointment, but at least the food was tasty and filling! I could see how it could get pricey, though. :)

A big fat thumb's up for Contigo Peru! Everything was delish-I ordered off of the appetizer menu. Causa-not what I expected but tasty. Actually, it was just as described now that I think about it. Chicken salad between two rounds of mashed potatoes. He got Pollo Saltado and downed it so fast, I didn't even see it. (We took it to go). We were hoping to try the rotisserie chicken but went on a Tuesday instead of Saturday or Sunday.  Will definitely be back to try other items. I believe it was the owner who was so nice, especially when we told her it was our first time in. She offered us some of the purple corn drink-yummy-and made a point to describe what other patrons were ordering. Oh yes, she gave us sauces to go with our dinner-I really wish I remembered what they were called. Spicy enough without making my eyes water, and very flavorful!

I donate here all of the time, but this time I actually dropped off something I was not supposed to drop off. Yikes! A week has passed, but I thought I'd give it a shot and see if I could get it back. Josh, one of the guys in the unloading dept., was very helpful. He even talked to the manager for me. Thank you so much Josh!

You can only get plastic bottled water?? How cheap can you be? And to not serve water to people who are drinking??

I was a little frustrated, thinking I couldn't just order a glass of water and fired off at the hip-Howard was quick to jump on it and clear things up! I appreciate that!!  As mentioned, the place is small, which just equals good seats from anywhere in the house. With any comedy show, you never really know what you are going to get, but especially with HH ending, it turned out to be hilarious! I didn't order food, but my friend did. She almost finished a whole burger-which for her, means good. The staff was friendly and courteous. I look forward to going back!

Expensive bahn mi (I'm used to Lee's, what can I say?) but full of flavor so worth it. It'd be awesome if there were better lunch prices. But braised pork with housemade chili sauce. Yum. Absent mindedly picked garlic fries -will avoid next time. Reminds me of fries from a fast-food joint that had been sitting under the heat lamp. Service was great! Sat out on the patio and enjoyed the sunshine. Can't wait to go back.

You should continuously bring water. What is with this place? After Happy Hour, service declines. If then. Where the heck is our water? We've asked every time and then, when I go to to the bar to ask, she wants ME to deliver the check?!?! We've ordered Happy Hour and beyond. Only because we waved someone down! You don't want us to order any more?!? Fine, I'm not interested! I just want water!

I would echo Athan. Care is outstanding, staff is always positive. Courtney couldn't be sweeter. The foundation of treatment is well-rounded, healthy and nourishing. I've learned so much from Dr. Collins.

I have to give a big shout out to Big Two. I stopped last minute to put oil in my car @ a nearby QT (I know right?) Of the 15 people that walked by, only a Big Two guy stopped to see if I needed help. I didn't but that rarely happens anymore. Thank you!
