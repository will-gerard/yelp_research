A great Derby Day event!!!! We always have a huge group that goes and we're VIP sat in our own private section. The drink service is good, but naturally slow bc the place is packed! 2 years in a row our group has won best dressed!!! Derby on!!! Or "Talk Derby to me"

I'm not talking bad about the pool, just stating what I experienced. With 2 grown men & myself in the pool (deep end) doing descents/ascents, buoyancy training & swimming around we constantly were bumping into each other or on top of each other.  It's great you have a pool on site, but to me that was not a make or break, when it came to where I was going to get certified. The reviews of the instructors (at the dive training site) is what made my decision.

I walked in at 1:10pm (oops 1pm appt) and was still out by 1:55, exactly 45mins later (like Brian said) On top of my appt to get my new wheels put on, I was informed I needed a new tire, Brian was very helpful with picking one that matched my other 3 (I'm a matchy type of girl) Now I'm safe to go with some new bling. Everyone that I was in contact with (Brad/Brian/Adam)we're very nice & knowledgeable on the products. I've had services done at DCT many times in the last 10 years & they never disappoint! Great job guys! I hope you're living your dream or will be in the future

TOTAL LEGIT COMPANY!!!! I locked myself out of my condo this morning & luckily I had my phone to reach out for help. A friend of mine suggested Lockout Services so I called, Josh was at the ready to meet me within the hr. He was right on time & had my door unlocked within LITERALLY minuets. He also made me an extra key free of charge! Josh was very professional & represented this company well. I will totally recommend this company to anyone needing a locksmith, for their home or car lockout! It was a pleasant experience during an unfortunate situation! Thanks!

Not even 1 star is deserved! I personally hate this place! Old, dirty, smelly bar with poor poor customer service! I would never recommend this place to anyone. I actually talk people out of going there! There are SO MANY better places in Old Town to get drinks and/or eat at! Close down Gilligan's PLEASE!!!

Such a great place to bring out of towners on a beautiful AZ breezy day. Great green chili cheeseburgers!!! They have animals....donkeys, roosters & baby rattlers. Live music on the weekends. Big biker bar. Lots of seating & parking. I wouldn't recommend driving home, having had to many adult beverages bc police patrol the area a lot. Yeeee Hawwww!

Loved this place! We sat outside by their fire pit & had dinner & drinks. The bartender Sean was very nice and recommended tasty drinks. Their HH is great. I had the tomato & goat cheese casserole and ate every last drop! It was very tasty! The ZuZu burger was very tasty as well. Comp valet was nice! The Valley Ho hotel is very trendy and cute! Will definitely visit again!!!

This place is a must visit! The estate is gorgeous & the food was delish. We had the $85/person tasting menu & loved every taste. Our waitress was the greatest. Throughout the entire 3hr dining experience there, she made sure we were always pleased. I do believe her name was Renee. My taste buds long to go back & try more. We had: Artisan & Farmstead Fromage board, Charcuterie, Artichoke soup, Roasted beet semi salad, aged wagyu carpaccio, potato gnocchi, day boat Alaskan halibut, aged New York strip, green apple cannoli & warm bread pudding. My mouth is watering just typing our menu. Enjoy dining!

LoCo is always a great place to go! It's one of my fave TT spots! The crunchy fish tacos are my fave along with the salt & pepper wings! All the bartenders & waiters/waitresses are prompt and very nice. They have a ton of TV's so if a game/fight is on you want to watch just ask. Nice new seating outside with a fire out. Inside can get really loud. I frequent here often with friends!!!

NOT a favorite spot, but it's close to home. It always takes FOREVER to get a drink at the bar & their food is all nasty fried food. Nothing tasty. Wouldn't recommend this place unless you have low standards or just want a beer.

OH MY MY where do I start???? I'll start with the bartender TOMMI called me a "Cunt" and a "Stupid fuckin bitch" in front of a bar full of people, then kicked me out!! All because she DOESNT KNOW HOW TO MAKE A MOSCOW MULE.  Yup that happened.  It was 10pm when myself & 2 other people came there and ordered a Moscow Mule, she attempted to make them but served us vodka soda w/ a lime. There was NO GINGER BEER in it. Clearly a Moscow Mule is GINGER BEER, vodka & lime juice. No mint! No soda water! So we returned the drinks (FULL) and said "AGAIN there is NO GINGER BEER in these" (we were there last Thurs & she tried to do the same thing to all of us, then charge me Moscow Mule prices, I said no I'm paying vodka/soda prices) I called a cab and we went outside to wait. The next thing I know TOMMI comes outside and starts yelling at me because, we were talking about how she doesn't know how to make the drink. She calls me a "cunt, a stupid fucking bitch, tells me the ginger beer gun must be out" and kicks me out. CLEARLY GINGER BEER NEVER COMES OUT OF A GUN. Ginger Ale does. On a side not I placed a phone call to 92nd St prior to going there last night because of what happened last Thurs night, asking if they had ginger beer now, I was told yes! So we went there only to get Moscow Mules. To our total disappointment and HORRIBLY UNPROFESSIONAL service we left.  We went to Chop & Wok and had many great tasting, well made Moscow Mules!!!!  I would NEVER EVER recommend this place! As to TOMMI, you need to really think about the words that come out of your mouth at the place of business you work at. #Classy Oh the unprofessionalism doesn't stop there, come to find out after we left a few of my friends went there (she knew we were friends) and she continued to talk shit about me and brag about kicking me out!!!! WOW!!!!!!

This place is great. I have been here a handful of times & never a disappointment! It's been our "Girls Sunday Tradition" for weeks & we always enjoy ourselves. You definitely can't go wrong with their popcorn app, edamame app or their lobster mac n' cheese, DELISH! The wine selection on the HH menu is not the best, but you can always order from their hard wine list (which we always do) Bottles are reasonably priced (most) Outside seating is great, when inside seating is too loud w/ the live band. Sunday nights, there is always a live Acoustic Rock group. They are a great cover band, with a few good originals. Complimentary valet-plus TIP is always convenient! This place is our weekly spot!

The food was great but the service was sub par. Took forever to get our drinks & I think they had to go pick the veggies before we got our app. Clean atmosphere and great location. I will go back and give them another shot.

I have been coming here for 10+ years, to get my hair cut, highlighted & styled by Stephanie, Abby & now Lauren. I have yet to have a bad experience. They are an Aveda salon (which I love) located right off Mill Ave in Tempe. Their parking is horrendous but it's worth the trouble. Great atmosphere and very clean. All the staff are super nice. I only schedule with the Master stylist, the price for services depends on the level of the stylist. I love this salon!

I couldn't say enough great things about this place! I frequent here at least once a week (dine in & take out) The food is superb & the wait staff is top notch! I love the seared ahi tuna salad (wasabi peas on the side) The seared ahi tuna dinner is divine too (substitute a side for grits) oh my goodness their jalapeño cheddar cheese grits are TO DIE FOR! I never not get a side of them. Their salmon app is delish along with their prosciutto wrapped asparagus & tuna poke. I have never had a bad thing here. Bonus: they have wine on tap!!! Their Moscow Mules are a must try! Jake (from State Farm) is our fave waiter.  If you haven't tried this place you definitely MUST!!! You won't be disappointed I promise!!!

I love how this place had 5 windows out of 18 open when I arrived at 12:30 & now at 2 there are 8 open windows and I bet the closer to 5pm it gets the more windows will open. Such BS! They need more employees so it's not a 3hr wait to just get a SSC replaced!!!!! #NeverAgain

Love this quaint little Italian Pizzeria! The Alla Mama pizza is my favorite. The Salmon bruschetta is very yummy as well! Small beer selection & I would recommend adding Stella to it. Great wine selection & I love their big patio, you don't feel like you're on top of the table next to you. The owner is very friendly and greets all customers when he's there. This is one of my top 3 pizza places in the valley! Definitely highly recommended!

So we had a group of 8 meet here for MNF/welcome back to AZ HH for a friend. I got there 10mins early & sat at the bar. Not once did I get greeted or asked if I wanted a beverage. Then my friends show up & we seat our selves in the couch section w/ a tv. We wait 20mins for a waitress (KeriAnn) to greet us & take only our drink orders. Then another 30mins goes by still with NO DRINKS yet. Finally a partial drink order makes it to our table and then the other half of our drink order makes it 15mins later. We watch the game & order food. The waitress messed up my order of shrimp & grits with shrimp ceviche, REALLY?? I also ordered the CAB sandwich (that was good) My shrimp and grits came out way after the fact that everyone was finished.  Ok-skip to the pay our tabs part....she then proceeded to charge me for the shrimp ceviche (that was more expensive then what I ordered) When I asked her about it she said "My managers busy so I couldn't cancel it out, but it's actually cheaper for you" WRONG. She finally did get the items fixed but also totally messed up on 2 other friends tabs (added drinks) and GET THIS..... Totally forgot an ENTIRE food order for someone & when asked about it she FORGOT AGAIN!!! He was served NO FOOD  the entire time we were there (3hrs)  They have a nice "game bar" concept with bags and all (that we wanted to play & drink more) but decided to relocate to The Lodge (just down the street) due to the HORRENDOUS service. I'm SAD The Lodge will be closing soon. I wish it was this place! Never will I be back here, there are way to many other great bars in the Old Town area with way better food & great service (Kelly's, LoCo Patron, RnR, Bungalow, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers, The Lodge, Bottle Blonde) Visit them 1st so you won't be disappointed!!

This place was fabulous!!!! Great food, wine and service! Evan was our server and he was exceptional! We had the bread board with hummus, feta, olives & eggplant spread.....delicious! The wine Evan recommend was a perfect pair. The restaurant had a great vibe and wasn't overly packed. We will definitely be going back many more times!!!

I took my car here for an estimate on some auto body damage to my car and the guy who helped me was very informative & professional. They use some sort of special technique that most auto body shops don't use. The store was very organized and clean. My time from in front door to out of front door (after being helped & estimate done) was no longer then 15mins. I plan to return here to get my auto body work done.

We had a group of 5 that experienced this great new spot last night! We were greeted with a smile promptly at the door and seated quickly in our reserved section. Our server Tony was at our table within minuets taking our drink orders. I got the Blueberry Smash.....so good! Others had the Fluer Di Lis & Strawberry Martini. We started with the goat cheese bake & Brussel sprouts, both delicious! Dinner consisted of the sausage flatbread, crab cakes & steak gnocchi. As if that wasn't enough food we ended with their French press coffee, chocolate cheesecake & ricotta desert. This place is a must try! Sit in Tony's section, he's the best! We all will definitely be repeat visitors! Check Twisted Root out!!!!
