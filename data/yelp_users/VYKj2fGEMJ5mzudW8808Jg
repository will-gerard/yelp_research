I know ... I know... your thinking - this chic lives in Seattle, Wa; why is she reviewing THIS salon? Well let me get my soapbox out from underneath my bed- make sure my mic is on. Haacchummmm...   I have been looking high and low for someone to give me a decent - I was just hoping for decent haircut and color. I have that kind of curly hair that everyone who doesn't have LOVES and everyone who has hates (you know the kind). Jessica Lawson is the only professional that I would ever let touch my hair again. Which in some ways really sucks cause I have to wait for my biyearly business trip to PHX. But she is worth the wait - and weight in gold.   She gives realistic advice about your hair; sets realistic expectations and delivers above and beyond service and professionalism.   I am happy and honored to have found someone who I trust.   Thank you Jessica.

Nice guy... he sang while I got my second tattoo...  It was the fastest tattoo I have ever gotten, hurt like hell but looks AMAZING!    VERY clean and everything you would need or want.

Bad service - super long wait. This place was empty- NOBODY was in there. We waited 2.5 hours to be seen; and the doctor was a JOKE. She moved so slow; she finally got in our room - said nothing remarkable. Read of her computer screen... was so unhelpful. Avoid this place like the Black Plague. That doctor needs to be seen mental health issues.
