I would highly recommend C & C Coin & Stamp.  I have been trying to understand the value of my coins, and this was the ONLY place that was candid and true. Ken explained that some of my coins were more valuable than either face value or weight value (ie. Silver dimes and quarters. I was told by others that the weight was truly the only value.  So, if you have some old coins laying around, and can sell them for the current price of gold or silver, DONT DO IT, until you speak to these guys first. And note, no shop will do it for "free". And if they do? You just got ripped because that shop knows that the coin was more valuable than the weight. But, I have learned that the % that most shops will deduct is 3%-5%  This place? A flat 2% is all it will cost for the cash. And depending how much you have? It could be as low as 1/2%!!  Please feel free to comment on your experience. Mine was great!  Lastly? They are open on Saturday too!!! 99% of the other coin shops are closed.

I feel that I owe this business a "new review".  After a 20 month personal boycott, I felt compelled to give them another opportunity to earn my business.  And what a surprise.  The Legend Cleaners of early 2013 is SO MUCH BETTER in late 2014.  I am a professional business traveler, and spend a substantial amount of money on my dry cleaning.  I was woo'd in by a competitor with the name of a laundry detergent.  After using Legend cleaners on a very large order, (a car load), I examined every garment with heavy scrutiny.  Results?  Flawless. And the dry cleaning portion of my load was much larger than the laundry.  Every pair of slacks, jackets, suits and sweaters were cleaned with the same care I would expect from a much more expensive service.  I trusted them with thousands of dollars worth of clothes.  They didn't let me down.  For that, they have "earned" 5 stars.  Thank you.

I am a 53 year old professional speaker, and have lost a lot of weight over the last 6 months. Historically, I have used an Italian born tailor for all of my alterations. However, being in a pinch, I went to choi tailoring for some major alterations in my jacket and slacks. (Major). I was shocked on how perfect the alteration was done. It was if the suit was rebuilt in Italy!  I have gone to other places for quick fixes before, and got what I paid for. And had belt loops within one inch of each other, or the jacket buckling when I sit. I can tell you with certainty, that choi tailoring is likely the best in the valley if not the state.

This place has really gone downhill fast. I have been going here for years, and really not paid attention to the competitors. They used to be called 1.00 cleaners. And at that price, I wasn't picky at all. Now? Not only have their prices soared, and force you to join their "club" for implied coupons, etc...  Well, I haven't received one coupon yet, and lastly, even Tide cleaners is now less expensive on laundry, and they do a great job. So my review is, DON'T waste your money at legend cleaners. The free bottle of 11 cent water does not make the difference.

This cleaners has become an over priced poorly managed cleaners. if you are an Ahwatukee person.  Go to Tide cleaners.  Their laundry is 20% cheaper and 100% better! The people at the counter at Legend are fantastic...but the end result is horrible cleaning.  If you want the cheapest place to clean a suit...go to Legend, unless the suit costs more than $100.  Because.....it will be shiny, with bubbles in fabric.  Scary...not worth the dollar savings compared to Tide...and they DO offer great coupons..and DONT CHARGE a membership fee...and by the way, Tide collects their money AFTER the work is done...Why???  Because they understand that a customer should pay for the product once good service is received.  Legend?  Pay me now...and good luck with the cleaning.

I'm that guy who will "tell it as it is".  Good or bad.  I think it's important to write this review to give my perspective on Desert Sunglass of Scottsdale. (I'm glad they are listed on Yelp)    Simply, I lost a pair of reading glasses bought in Atlanta.  And unfortunately, they were my favorite pair, and have never seen them sold at any place before.  The hotel told me that they get them from Desert Sunglass!  Wow!  Lucky me!  I was shocked that this hotel (in Atalnta) buy from a distributor in my back-yard.  So, I call Colleen at Desert Sunglass to ask her if she can help me replace my reading glasses.  Of course, they were lost, and I didn't have a model number..and Desert Sunglass has a selection of thousands to choose from.   Colleen asked for me to describe them, but i didn't do a great job.  Then she asked if i happen to have (another pair that is similar that I could take a photo of, and send her, she would try to narrow it down.)  Well, I did that...and she did her research.  After a short time, she found the glasses i was looking for, as well as others that I liked.  Because they dont sell to the public, she found a customer that she sells, and sent them to this place for me to purchase.  The reason I am taking the time to write this review is because Colleen took the time to communicate, and make sure I was satisfied.  All for one pair of $20.00 reading glasses.  I mean really.  THAT is customer service at its best.

To begin, I simply found this dermatology office using an Internet search engine. It was NOT recommended by anyone.  Upon arriving for our 11:30 appointment, I completed the new patient paperwork.  Pretty standard stuff.  Waited in lobby, and was eventually called into the examining room.  All's good so far.  Then, an assistant came in to write some details down for the "doctor" to see.  (And I use the term "doctor" loosely.)  Anyway, the assistant was extremely pleasant and inquisitive, and if she were the doctor, this review would be completely different.  Anyway, the "doctor" knocked, and entered. Her appearance was more of an evening entertainer than of a doctor.  The overdone eyelashes with gold accents, along with her hair cascading over one shoulder would make any reasonable person think to themselves "Is this a nightclub?  Or a doctor's office?"  In any event, in preparation for this appointment, we had brought in all of the different products, or other medications we were using, assuming this "doctor" would take the time to tell us which ones we should continue to use, or at least explain with some sort of knowledge, on why we should or should not use the products.  BUT NO, instead, this "doctor" went into a canned pitch on selling Glytone Mild Gel which is (and I quote her) "only available for DOCTORS or MEDICAL OFFICES to sell"  And of course, I have decent insurance, so I ask if it's available as a prescription at my local pharmacy? (Using my small copay), yet he reply was no...BUT, STILL HAVE TO BUY IT FROM A DOCTOR"  So, moving on, and still with the "doctor" in the office, I ask her to please look at the products that my son was using and to help me understand what to do.  She picks up just one bottle, looks at it, gives a sarcastic comment (that I do not recall) on why it doesn't work, and then moves on.  She asks "Any more questions?"  My initial thought was, "Yeah, do you actually have a degree?  Or, do you simply survive on looks alone?"  But, instead, I just said "no thanks, were fine", and went to the check-out area to buy this Doctor Sold only "GLYTONE MILD GEL WASH"  So, she brings it out, but not realizing that I had a UPC shopping scanner on my phone. Of course, this is not going to pop up!  How can it, being only available to doctors and all.  I scan the box.  Did it pop up as selling elsewhere?  YES!!! In fact, while this office sold it for $32.00, it was available all over for as little as $17.99!!!  It's no wonder the doctor recommended this product.  She probably thinks that the majority of their clients won't check options, and of course, why would they?  Their "doctor" said it's only available through medical offices.  Bottom line?  This place needs to be exposed for what they really are.  Good news? (For me anyway) I did not agree to that 30 day follow up appointment that she tried to sell...to capture more co-pays...and more insurance money...  I'll bet "CASSANDRA SHORE" is a big hit with all of the "MEN"  she......ahem....."treats".

To begin, I'd like to make it clear that my 1 star rating may imply that a "star is deserved". But it's not. This business should be reported to the BBB. Let me start by saying that "I did not choose this company". They are the "house account" that services our apartment complex. Hopefully, that will change shortly.  It started this way. We had been having issues with "bed bugs" and told the complex that we'd like to hire an exterminator. They said that they use Smart Pest Solutions, and that we would need to use them. Then, we were told that Smart Pest solutions would need to come out and thoroughly inspect the apartment to see where they were, etc. and the cost of the "INSPECTION" would be $75.00, then there would be another charge for the service itself.   Well, the inspector came out, walked into the bedroom, lifted the mattress, then left. He was there less than one minute. That was our $75 inspection. Of course I complained to the apartment complex, as that is who I have to pay. They apologized, but was unable to do anything else.   So the appointment was set, and the inspector came in, said that the area was cleaned sufficiently, and left. That was another $75 charge.   But to be truthful, I would defend the pest control company on that one. The apartment (wasn't) ready to be sprayed. Turns out, there was a sheet that the apartment complex failed to give us explaining the customer prep, so they ate that charge.   So, Smart pest control solutions says that they need to come out 3 separate times over a few weeks. We suspect they did that because we embarrassed them at their 1st $75 charge. We suspect they were put on notice by our apartment complex management.   So this is how it ends. SMART PEST CONTROL SOLUTIONS DID THEIR FINAL TREATMENT TODAY, and this is how they left my apartment. I came home to this.   Photos attached.  I added 2 more photos

I'm not that guy who writes a review on just "anything". For me, I use Yelp to call out either "exceptional" service, or "exceptionally poor" service.  And I too, read the reviews, to get a perspective of what I'm going to deal with. Or what to expect.  Yet, I find it quite "interesting", that in the past month or so, all of a sudden, this auto center is getting these 1 star reviews.  (I find it interesting only because I've been going to this shop FOR 5 YEARS because I (finally) found a place I can trust. (Meaning, after I leave, there is no "mysterious" problem that ends up occuring within weeks of the repair. And they have saved me thousands of dollars, as well as standing 100% behind their work.  So I ask, "Whats up with the bad reviews guys?"  And went over them, one at a time.  June 1st.  First, if there is an accident, and it is determined that the rotors were the cause.  And Sears just replaced the pads, but didn't fix the rotors.  Who pays lawsuit?   Sears.  And Brake Fluid Flush?  Well, anyone that knows about this process, can easily understand the issues with a brake fluid flush done by a budget shop.  Big Difference.  Lastly.  Holding the keys?  Can you picture this?  You are at Sears Automotive.  Owned by Sears Holdings.  A historic company doing business for over 120 years.  Over 2000 stores nationally. And the Sears employee is playing Keep-Away with this guys keys?  I mean, C'mon already.  June 17th.  OK, Sears get a one star for taking too long, and not complying with a window request. Of course, the technician purposefully wound down the window after getting "explicit instructions". Really?  Does that mean they get 5 stars for simply getting uit done on time, or early?  Do you think that everybody is "yelping" to say "Hey, they did exactly what they said they were going to do"?  No.  July 9th-  OK...I agree.  Mr. H had every right to express dissatisfaction with 1 star in this case.   July 20th....OK...now c'mon.  When your yelp name is Unhappy C, that already sounds like someone with a motive.- Read it.  Really? "Oh, but we are really busy/" Really?  As if.   And "Unhappy C certainly could call out Blakes name, but dont you find it interesting that the guy who "pissed Unhappy C off" said "Oh, but we are really busy." doesnt have a name? known in the review as "Customer Rep" Yet, this type of review is allowed to post?  Wow!  LASTLY, July 23rd, "Generous" Ms B. Read it.  Did anyone notice t hat this customer was advised that they had a "LINE OF CUSTOMERS"??  Hello??  And they didn't call back?  Hmmm.. Think it is possible that the line of customers meant they were very busy?  Yeah, I think I would go there after they didn't call back...And, also see that THEY WERE STILL BUSY WHEN I GOT THERE!   And of course, the "employees standing around"?  Heaven knows that those employees couldn't have been service technicians that do not deal with the customers on the floor.  And then after seeing my car up on the jack with no tire, there is no way that they were just trying to work me in fast, while they were searching for the tire I was looking for.  When they say they carry the brand, should one assume they care every size in that brand?  No Ms B.  I dont want to live there, but only beleive it's unfortunate that we cannot give YOU a one star review.   I hope you read this.  I know with certainty that this operation has the integrity, and work ethic of the highest standards.  But am saddened to see these type of reviews.  Again, I dont write reviews just for the sake of writing them. If a business does their job, then (in my mind) no review is necessary.  Apparantly I'm wrong in this case.  If this business received reviews from every customer they served, I would guarantee the average would still be 5 stars regardless of the complaints.

So...I've been just sitting here...reading the reviews. And the 1star reviews? Gotta be kidding!  I think there was one comparing Freddy's to Fuddruckers. No comparison. Quality versus quantity. I'll go quality every time.   I'm originally from St. Louis. The reviews comparing Freddy's to Steak 'n Shake are right on. It's that same burger that I used to watch being cooked (as a kid in the 60's.)    But the really cool surprise was the frozen custard. Oh my gosh!  Again, the St. Louis tradition was Ted Drewes frozen custard. I used to wait in this  super huge long line to be served. They owned the market. And I've never had anything even close... Until now. Freddy's nailed that one too!!  Yeah... An easy 5 star review. (Wish I could give 6 stars as a bonus for the super friendly staff)
