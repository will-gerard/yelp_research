i like this place.  I love music and I love sports and the mix of this place is perfect.  After a suns or D-backs game I think this is a wonderful place to hang.  I wish it was open later and stayed busy more often, but hey... this is Phoenix and this place is quirky!  Good food and I love the waitresses with the Alice eye makeup.   This is a place I hope stays open forever.  Good prices too.  Really good for the area and what you would expect.

How can a eatery get mexican food SO wrong?!!  I had a bad feeling when I walked in and the lady was looking at us like "what are you doing here!?!!!?  Don't you know the food sucks and you will get sick???"  Well.. I got a fajita burrito and the peppers and onions were boiled.  The chicken was bland. My girl's tacos were crummy too.  If ever a reason to go there I guess the chips and salsa are ok. That would give it a star. But otherwise... I would never advise this place.  Sorry. I hate to be mean. I always try to find something good about an eatery. This place was hard to find anything good.

This place is very average.  Very nice decor and the menu is pretty good but the atmosphere is crapola. especially for a brewery.  Trying to be upscale but it really doesnt get there.  Not bad for lunch specials but overall this place is just average.

I love pizza and this is not bad but overrated to me.  My friend from Boston she loves this pie because they cut it into squares and it reminds her of pie from a chain back in Beantown.  I think it is just ok.  Kind of bland, a little pricey.  Good for out here I guess, but not really that good.

I would actually like to give this place 4 1/2 if possible.  I love italian food and really I could rate about 100 places from NJ but I havent been there in so long things may have changed and some of my favs might not even be there.  The fam who owns this place is from Connecticut  I do believe.  Real nice people with sincere italian accents.  There pizza reminds me alot of east coast pizza and is probably the closet to what I remember for alot of pie in NJ.  It is really damm good.   The best thing I have had here however...  is the Veal Parm Panini. I think they bake the bread there and the Veal is definitely all done on site.  My mouth is watering thinking about the place right now. As a matter of fact... Im ordering now!

This place has everything I want.  Love their premium chocolate.  Love the salad bar.  Love the gourmet meats and bottled products.  Could easily spend $500 with no problem if I was a glutton which i try very hard not to be.  Well sometimes. maybe.   Order a chicken salad on sour dough bread.  I get pepperjack cheese and olive oil and balsamic.    My ideal glutton food shopping exp. would be AJ's and Trader Joes and then stock the bar over at bev moe....

Go sit at the bar and watch the legendary sushi chef Masa perform his craft.  It is done at a super high level and the Wednesday Night sushi half price deal is fun.  There be a whole lot of sushi goin on.  Good times, good people and great sushi.  Order anything it really doesnt matter as everything is done at a very high level.   If you really want to get crazy then have Masa make you his special spicy sauce to go along with some of your rolls.  Its legit.  Not for the weak however...  The service in this establishment is great as well I must admit. Overall this place is a big time winner for sushi.

There was a place called JP Lee in NJ and we used to eat and I loved it. I thought I would never find it again, but then I did with YC's. Same shit.  Here is a couple of tricks.  Ask for water chestnuts during the day, they will get them from the back. Make the meal so much better.  Here is my Bowl of YC's Krunk Slop that I love:  Pork and Chicken in bowl Cover with onion and one scoop of wine pat down  put veggies on. I go for water chestnuts and Bamboo shoots Then 2 scoops: hunan thai yc's own soy garlic seame oil  sprinkle chili oil  put noodles on top.  (Egg noodles)  do all sauces again.  then put on the flat grill.  Tell them NO WATER.  Water dilutes the sauce and seasoning.    This is a must eat.

this place is pretty interesting.  I love the decor and the glass panes in front of the bar and lounge seating is all kind of awesome.  the vip bathrooms are pretty tremendous as well.  I have no idea really how good this place is but I went there with 4 blondes who had bottle service and there was a bachlorette party gettin freaky.  Automatic points for girl to guy ratio.  More clubs should strive for this. the world would be a better place.  Nice waitress, dj was ok.  Still an awesome time.

Maybe, this place isnt the greatest...  I dunno I just love the inside lighting and the juke box and the couches!  The ambience just does it for me.  even going outside to watch the crowds going by is fun.   Never had the food so it might suck for all I know, but I just love sitting on those couches ordering drinks from the punk-esque waitresses.  If I lived around there it would be my hang out fo sho,

I guess different strokes for different folks, but I think place is absolutely amazing, and I hope it stays open until the end of time.  The bartenders are awesome. They dont have their head up their ass like many of the places in town.  The midget bar is fantastic as are all the midget seats.  The place is decorated and lit in a way that just says come into this wacky place and have yourself a damm good time.  The music was good on the juke box, and there was a lack of the 30k millionaire attitude that many of these places have.  I love fun original places and this place takes the gold medal for that.  Gilligans, I will consistently entertain your 3 hour tour, 3 hour tour....

Really not sure why so many other yelpers hammer this place...  Took a quaint damsel to this fine establishment and had quite a great time. Had the Steak Fajitas, she had the chicken fajitas, both were fab and the I was really impressed with the beans and rice which were certainly above average.  The Guac seemed like it may have been processed a bit, and the salsa was good but a bit watery.    The outside patio is nice and cozy.  I think it is pretty damm good, but I am so biased with mexican food. It is hard not for me to love it.

Some times you go to a place and it is so awesome you have to find your computer and yelp about it right away. Well..  this is one of those times.  Went there today and had a pizza with sausage and onion.  the Mozarella is dynamic. The sauce is amazing and the crust (thin) was incindiary.  This may have been the the best pizza I have ever had.  I called my friend in jersey right after and told her.  I explained it may be blasphmeny but I think this may be better than any pizza I have had even in NJ.  She hung up on me.  Oh well.  She will be out to visit soon and I will get a chance to show her!

Is this the best restaurant in Olde Town?  Maybe.  Great service, beautiful ambience.  Great place for a date.  Rotiserrie chicken with the rice is my favorite dish. It is just so damm good.  Not over expensive either.  Great deserts as well.  Guys who read this take a date their.  You wont be sorry.

Simply put... I go here every single week. I think it is the best 24hr burrito shop. I don't know why, i just like the ingrediants and the way they cook their food.  Pork Adobas (sic) burrito with guac is amazing california burritos are my favorite love the chile relleno burrito as well..  Place is AWESOME.  ALot of these places can be all the same, but Fiesta I think is the best.

This place is douchebag central.  You go in and iif you are not dressed like a punker then you are ignored or ridiculed from a distance.  I heard there is a room in the back for after hours sex acts but that may be a pseudo rumor the same way this is a pseudo place.

Definitely a fan now.   Please disregard the first review.   I now know the owners of this bar and they are very very cool and they love great music of all kinds and the staff is fun.  Definitely a place to go and see a show or hang.   It is very dark, and there is a wide array of visitors from college kids, to wanna bees to good musicians.  It is fun.  I would advise making a pit stop in any night even if you are just bouncing around Scottsdale.

Im updating my score for JJ's because well, um, uh... Im bias as hell!  When I first moved here to AZ, I spent a ton of time in this place and even moonlighted for awhile as the friday night karaoke host.  I made tons of friends here and the owners and staff always treated me like I was family.  The guys in the kitchen always would make special requests for me, and the girls would sometimes let me come behind the bar and bartend for kicks when I wasnt  hosting karoke.  Now will they do this for you.... most likely absolutely not.  But the owner just updated and renovated the place and it is looking good and I guarantee it is still fun as hell.    I made quite a few friends and lovers in this place and it is legendary in my mind...

I kind of think this place is highly overrated.  It pisses me off because coming from Jersey this place is kind of weak.  Like others have stated the service is very slow and everytime I order hard Salami it is this little thinly sliced salami and I have never had it in any other Italian deli.  Not so good.  They do however sell jars of Centos products and I love the olive oil, cherry peppers, and pepperocinis so I will give them their due.  Go for the products, but if you want a sub sandwich go down the street to Jersey Mikes.

I gave an extra star just because it is so fun to hang out here.  The waitresses are always cute and friendly and not afraid to pour your drink.  Alot of my friends are in love with the food here, I have to disagree. I think good but not great.  Still this place gets the nod from me just because it is so fun to hang out.  Chances are you will meet some new friends there too.

Yeah 100th Review!!!!   Saved this one for 100 because it is special me thinks.  If you are not a music lover, or are disgusted by hippies and people who enjoy live music you will hate this place.  I love it. It is really great to see bands that can rip on their instruments You don't see too many bands here with guys who play shitty.  Nice outdoor patio and usually people are pretty friendly at least when they stop spinning and twirling.  Anyway, the place is not for everyone.. but I think it is one of the most needed and essential live music venues in Phoenix and the whole valley.

whether out back on the patio or in the bar.  It is fun. great college bar. Irish of ourse which means... people are getting drunk!   Tuesday night they have the open mic which is my style and as long as the place is not packed to the gills anynight RulaBula is a great place to make a new friend :)

I love love love love love this place.  Completely smitten.  I have been here 4 or 5 times in the last month.  I'm going back again. Soon!  You can either sit in the main restaurant which has a classy old world feel to it or you can sit in the back bar which is separate.  The price is a bit cheaper in the back bar but the portions are a little smaller I think.  My Dad was in town from NJ. I took him here to the main restaurant. He had a Veal Parm plate.  Now my first reasons for love is the marinara sauce. A bit sweet but so so so good.  He felt the Veal was one of the best he had and cooked perfectly and he has it all the time back on the shore so that says something.     Apparently the owners are originally from Italy and the family home makes from scratch, all the pasta and sauce etc. It is so apparent.  In the ba,r the bar keep are really cool people, and act like friends just hanging out cooking for you and looking to help you get drunk if that is your thing..   But here is the #1 reason for my love:  The Linguini with Clam sauce. White or Red.  Some of the best I ever had. My mom used to make this at home and I have rediscovered it. It was missing from my life and I forgot about it. Now we have reconnected and I am much happier.  Red or White this is the best dish I have had in a  LONG time.  Simply outstanding.  Its a love thats gonna last...

what a great great bar.  I love coming here in the day and relaxing all day with friends. It is such a chill place.  The food is pretty tasty and the waitresses are always cool. There is a mix of everyone there from punks, to preps and everything in between and everyone is cool.  I also love to pee on the blarney stone and you should do it too if you get the chance.  If you are bored and are not sure where to go this is the best answer.

this place pissed me off.  why I am giving it 4 stars? well Im not sure. It is more like 3 1/2.  Yes the pizza is that good.  I found there sauce to be some of the best I have ever had.    Why does the wait have to be 3 hours though? There is no need for it.  I know it creates a stir, and it is something to talk about and people have talked about it... but it is bullshit.  Open tables in front of the place outdoors and you cant sit and eat out there?  WTF??  I would go back, and I am sure I will.  But it is bullshit.  Great pizza, crummy concept.

I think this is possibly the best ballpark in baseball.  I will only give it a 4 rating because the Red Sox dont play here but other than that it is perfect.   Got a ticket on left field line, field level for 30 bucks.  Nice and air conditioned.  Really easy to see the action. Comfortable seating.  Cheap parking outside ($5).  Im used to the east coast like Fenway and Yankee stadium where I can expect to spend way too much.  I wish the D-Back fans were a little more into the games, but the longer this ticket is in town who knows? things might change.

simply put, I think this is the best Mex restaurant in the valley.  At least of all the ones I have eaten at.  Get the guac salad.  SO GOOD!!!   Also the mole sauce is to die for and even better their pork in chipotle sauce.  In fact I have eaten their many many times and had nothing less than an exceptional meal.  LOVE IT!

went with my cuz for thanksgiving dinner.  (not a traditional turkey lover)  Good times.  Really liked the decor.  Very trendy and modern.  Loved the piano player. I wish there were more bars like this around here.    Food was GREAT.  service was real good too.  I had dumplings and pork lomein and my cuz at a spicy veggie tofu dish.  He could not stop raving about it.  All in all we feasted with a few other dishes and spent about $75 total.  Well worth it and we have decided we will go back sooner than later.

So everyone in the phx yelp universe has written a review of this place so I will keep it short.   Girlie took me there.    I loved it.  The sweet african peppers breaded with goatcheese and deep fried is absolutely insane.  This place is very unique. Absolutely deserves 5 stars.    This is all.

stopped in while waiting to go to dinner on thanksgiving.  Jukebox was playing Blind Melon (one of my favorites)   I have been here before and people are always friendly and ready to get drunk!  Also the bartender was super friendly to us. She made fun of me because I requested orange-cran-sprite because I was the DD but ordering a drink like that I think I well deserved it.  This is a great place.  One of the better hang out pubs in Phoenix in my op.  Will go back of course.

I really dig this place.  Angel and his wife (owners) are wonderful people, and do everything possible to ensure that your food is delightful.  It is not overpriced and the salsa is my favorite.  The verde salsa with the monterrey and guac cubes is amazing. So is the red salsa.  Fajitas are simply great and I have heard that the Margaritas are pretty damm good too.  Great atmosphere and I hope they stay open a long long time.

SO.... Yelp led me to this place.  I was bored and craving Mexican so I took a ride down town.  Really classy place. A lot of time was placed into the decor and i liked the vibe.  Went for lunch and the place is big and im not sure there was anyone else there.  I had come to this place just because of the review that the one girl did when she asked "how come no one ever told me about this place?"    I feel the same.  Had a guac salad and I had a marinated chicken that looked like an El Pollo Loco chicken but it was much much much better.  I think the menu said the chicken was cooked on a wood palate.  Very tasty. Salsa was only weak spot as I didnt think it was that great.  Other than that it was a great meal in a classy place, didnt break the bank.  No reason not to go back.

4 stars fo sho  Great bread.  Not chinced.  Its open 24 hrs and the dudes are from NJ so that is a double shot of somethin something.  Love the cheesesteak hoagie with grilled onion and they are the only friggin place in the valley that has Hot Cherry Peppers!  Every place needs Cherry Peppers.  IF you are a eatery and you read this get them!!  Lots of meat on the hoagie.  Perfect if your drunk to get just a little bit sloppier.

k...  Here is the deal.  I would give this place a 5 if I had never had east coast italian.  Fot italian food anywhere I think this is a great place though. Really cool decor. Loved the bar. Our bartender Frank was a really cool guy.    The fact that this place is a cougar heaven makes it extra cool (Cougars need lovin too!)  I think the best italian I have had in phoenix.  Had a spinach salad and bruschetta which was SO good.  Bruschetta was one of the best I have had anywhere.  Had a Sausage and peppers in a red Cream Sauce.  Very very tasty.  Food was way better than I thought it would be.    Just might go for happy hour today because I am cravin the itailian and the cougar atmosphere is a good one.

Yeah Yeah Yeah.. This place has been covered so many times, but I come here all the time.  I have had better gelato back east so it is not the best.. but it is damm good and it is a great place in olde town to catch some ice cream.   If you are in the hood of olde town and have someone on your arm this is a great place to take them for a treat.

This place based on what it could be... is a Dud.  Food is so-so.  Salsa is like marinara sauce. They say it is fresh guac, but it looks and tastes like it is out of a can.  They have cool yelp check in discounts.  But the food is just average.  I think Sandbar has just as good food, and better chips salsa and guac, if you are looking to do Bar type Mexican food.

I know everyone and their grandmother has already reviewed this place, so I will be quick.  I love this place.  Yes it is more "western" chinese.  But it is light years better than PF changs, or other chain type places.  Every time we have been going we get something different from the menu and have yet to have anything less than a fantastic meal.  It is also very affordable. Plenty of things on the menu for under $10 per plate.  Me likey...

Taste is pretty tasty!   Took some friends to this place and they got drunk!  Those margaritas hit hard.  Food is very good.  Kind of like an asian, cajun, american mix.  I had the jumbiliya.  Pretty damm good.  Service was great.  Chica was over nice to me and I felt it was a duty to tip well.  High class, but good pricing.  cant wait to go back.

I agree this place kind of sucks.  Food is average. and although it looks really nice no one ever seems to be there.  It is always dead.  they have great TV's and I think the place should hop but instead it is not.  Go to tanked fish next door. everyone else does.  This place looks really good and I like the bar set up. reason for 2 stars.

F this place.  Seriously...  Well, maybe not. The staff is really really cool and the chicks in the nurses outfits are hot.  But, seriously... wtf?!?!?!?  I felt so sick after eating at this pit.  I really don't ever want to go back. And really... shame on me. I knew that it would happen.  It is the only solution to a burger and fries cooked in Lard.    I won't go back, but I will tell anyone that is over 350 pounds they will feed you for free in this place. Seriously..  WTF?!?!?!

Happy Hour is legit here.  I love any place in Olde Town that looks great and has a great crowd but it doesn't take a strippers pay check to hang out.  This is a place like that.  Went at happy hour for a friends birthday.  We ordered what seemed liked everything on the menu and everything was delish and nothing broke the bank.  Very pleased.  Im not a sushi snob in anyway as you can see I like almost every place I go to. However, do to the fact that they have great food, waitresses, great bathrooms, and a pic of Jimi Hendrix at the bar this place easily gets 4 stars.  Only reason I wont give it 5 is I have been here at night and the place has gotten too crowded and that gets annoying.  4 1/2 stars

Went here to meet a good friend. This is one that really should be 3 1/2 stars but they were very nice so I'll add the half.  I liked this place alot. They have a good deal as well as I my sushi came with edamame, (sic) miso soup, salad, and green tea ice cream. We ate alot and for 2 of us it came to about $30.  I liked that alot.  The chefs and the service were very friendly.  I had a Ray Roll which was alvacado, spicy tuna, and in fact is was some of the best sushi rolls I ever had.  So why only 3 1/2 stars?  Well this will sound weak, but I just wasnt in love with the decor. The lighting is too bright and the place looks like it would just be average.  The presentation is also done on fast food trays.  It just seems for sushi that good that the ambience would go along with it.  So anyway... Try this place out.  It works very well.

mmmmmmmm....   I friggin love this place.  The greatest damm subs in the whole world. straight from NJ.  I moved here about 4 years ago from NJ and missed this place so damm bad.  It is a little overpriced, but the fresh ingrediants are so far and above any other sub place out here it makes it worth it.  Whether you get a #11, a Cheesesteak, or a Turkey Provolone and Bacon, you will not go wrong.  Wow my mouth is watering right now.

There are just not nealy enough rib joints in Phoenix. Im so glad Shanes came along. A little over priced, but I really love their sauce. Love the Caroling Vinegar and love the vinegar peppers.  hmmmm...  very good.  If you get a half a rack special you will be overstuffed with smile..  About 14 to 15 bucks for 2 sides and a half rack. A little too pricy for that meal but still damm good.

I give this place 4 stars, simply because the staff is so friendly and interactive.  I didnt catch the bartenders name (red head) but she was so nice and everyone looked to make sure that we were happy.  Watching football on a weekend day, it was very easy to make us happy.  The food is not exceptional, but very good price wise, and there are plenty of games to keep people interested.  I have taken a first date there on a few times, and it has only helped never hurt.  Based on fun and customer service I gotta give the 4th star.

always wanted to review this place but I usually stay away from chains..  I do have to comment that their marinated grilled chicken is some of the finest I have had.  I recently had their new BBQ chicken and well that was great too.  I dont really see the point in reviewing too many fast food joints but El Pollo Loco is special.    Sometimes I have seen people get pissed with the service because they think it is a fast food joint and it takes a while sometimes for the food to cook.  People need to just stand back and relax.  It is worth the wait, although sometimes the place is understaffed.  I love the crazy chicken.

I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE!  I go on my way to work, and just love all the different smoothies that they have.  I think I have almost had everyone on the menu and I love adding the extra goodies like Spirulina or Whey Protein.  The person who owns it and their staff are hard working and put alot of effort into there stuff and you can taste the results.  Every sandwich on the menu is entertaining and not boring or the same ol same ol.  The bread used on the sandwiches is very fresh and soft as well.  The flatbead sandwichs are good too.  My favorite is the island combo where you can get half a sandwich and a smoothie for 6 bucks.  Just awesome.  oh, and also pick up a club card.  I have gotten a few free smoothies already.

ok.  went this weekend.  this place is GREAT.  Only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the bartenders changed their pricing for drinks according to who went up to get drinks and when.  For me I dont drink so i dont care, but my friends felt a little po'd...  Great place to dance. not too crowded. no cover.  great ambience.  I also love the cabanas.  great place to chill.  The black painted bathrooms are very chic.  You see some very fine dressed ladies here.  My head was constantly turning, and the ladies i came with were having a blast.  The outside wall with the movies playing on it, and the outside swing was real cool as well.  This could be a go to place.

K.. I don't get it.  I go there every now and then.  I have only had the pizza.  It is a step up from supermarket frozen pie.  I like it because I like frozen pizzas... but I think the ratings given are a bit misleading.    It is "cost effective" and if I think this place might be amazing for stoners..  But if you are looking for high quality pizza this is not it.  I would however get it over the chain stuff.

I have never really had much Puerto Rican food so I'm not sure how much of an authority I am to speak on this... but who cares.  I'm doing it anyway cause this place and the meal I had was damm good.  Had Pan fried Pork Chops with grilled onions and the yellow rice with beans.. The more I ate the more I realized how damm good this meal was.  Also it helps that there is a huge flat screen that plays videos of Puerto Rican recording artists, and most of the videos features the bundas of some fine women...    Great Place.

Jersey's is cool. Plain and simple. Doesnt look like much from the outside but it has got some spirit.   they have a lunch special or happy hour I think where they have a 3 dollar gyro.  For sho hard to beat.  Not the greatest food but who cares.  They are really friendly and when I went back the bartender remembered my drink even though it was kind of busy.  That is cool.  They also have fun stuff like Wii sports and bean bagging and karaoke.  Good place to meet people and hang out and do what you want.    One other thing.... they have sports packages where I always get to watch my Red Sox.  A place should not be considered a sports bar if you cant watch the game you want when it is on. (Bar owners please that notice of that)  Good times.

ive fallen in love with this place.  I have gone back a few times, and I think it is great.  I love the sauce quite a bit.  This pie just reminds me more than anything else of a pie I would get on the NJ shore in summer.    If they dont have a pie out and ask for a slice they usually will throw a whole pie in if you are willing to hang out for a few minutes.  Lots of games on the TV. They apparently are big Yankee fans and that kind of sucks but I guess that is part of the package.   I would rather go here then wait for 3 hrs at some other place.  Still love Grimaldis the most of any pizza I have ever had, but I could eat Vincents pie every week.

Went there again the other day as I was in the neighborhood.  SImple NY type pizza as if you would find it on the boardwalk on the jersey shore.  FANTASTIC.  I get the feeling this place will become a chain sooner than later. It is that good.

this is a very very very nice place.  Go there quite often as I work close. They have some stuff here I havent found elsehwere..  Bubble Tea and Hong Kong Milk Tea.  Very Nice and unusual.    House made pastries.   yummy  Killer Breakfast Burritos.  Pricing is really good at this place too.  The people I know who go there keep going because it just a great place to have close by.  Probably go get a turkey sausage or chorizo burrito tomorrow...

They have great vibes!!! The place to go if you are in need of some smoke supplies.   Many people on the Internet say this is the best smoke shop in the entire valley!

Holy F%#K!!!   This place is mind blowing.  Pizza was AMAZING!  Did the Fradiavolo pizza.  This place is so unique. It has an olive oil and red pepper mix that you can pour on your pizza and dip your crust in.  So unique, and I just could not stay away from it. Olive Oil and Red Pepper.. These are a few of my favorite things!  This pizza is fantastic. I usually like a thin and crunchy crust and the way they cook it the pizza is very fluffy... but oh my. It tastes fantastic and is really unlike other pie I have had.    This place got 5 stars because as the icing, I had an itailian desert which was a chocolate pastry with chocolate cream on the inside. It had a fancy name so I don't know what to call it... but it was fantastic.  I can't wait to go back.

2nd time I was in a bind and needed to get something done fast with a car that had taken a dump.  This dealership got myself the first time and my Lady the second time into great cars.  There was no negotiation as they have a take it or leave it price that is very fair.  New or Used.  They are also very fair on trades, and have been nothing but completely honest and they completely know their products.  It is a first class operation and we could only wish that all or most dealerships operated like this.

was there over the weekend...  the room was absolutely 1st class.  Beautiful tub, glass shower, flat screen tv, wireless, ipod dock, great views..  excellent.  Partied up in the club on the 14th floor.  Good times.  This place is really classy and fun. I was with a mixed crowd and found something for everyone.  Only complaint is that the price for everything besides the room as way over done. Drinks.. Food...  Come on. Felt like they were trying to bleed us.  But...  Still a great evening and 1st class hotel room.

My girl and I found a groupon so we figured it was next on the list.   First thing when I walked in I was amazed at the big outside patio and how classy the place looked.    Had shrimp cooked in a garlic butter and I think it was the most perfect piece of shrimp I have EVER had.  I cant wait to get it again.  Had a Guac salad that is as Good as Sombreros ,which I think is as good and fresh as can get.  The green salsa they had I also found to be unlike any other I have had.    Service was great.  No complaints at all. As a matter of fact, I question how this place could ever get a 1 star.  I mean.. ok it is all an opinion.. but decor alone makes this place at least get 1 and half stars and the food even if it was mediocre would get it up to 2 stars.  Oh well.. Opinions are like ASSHOLES.  (I love that saying!)  The waitress explained that everything on the menu is cooked fresh to order and made on command, and nothing is kept ready for quick use.  I tasted it in the food. Loved it, cant wait to get some more of it!

I really think this is the best movie theater experience I have had since seeing U2360 3d on Imax.  My lady and I went and saw Something Borrowed. The movie itself was eh, but I really did not care.  I got 2 tickets for $25 a piece, which included waiter service and a full menu. Complimentary popcorn is included as well as reclining sofa chairs, and pillows, and soft blankets.  Thought it was an awesome experience.    The food cost is separate and it is restaurant prices. We had a flatbread BBQ shortrib pizza like thing and it was good.  We actually ordered food before we went in, and I am thinking that we should have just ordered food right from our seats.    Still a GREAT experience and a great date idea.  We went to Tanzy which is right next to the place and found that to be a great appetizer experience with an open air setting.  We also hung around Salt was well which is connected to the Theater.  Great experience. Cant wait to do it again.

We love this place!  Christina is the best bartender!  Sometimes some sad faces come to the bar who don't like fun, but most of the time this is a wonderful place to have brunch with friends.  If you are hung over or just down for some good food this is a wonderful place.

This place rocks. Great food. Great owners. Great prices. No bullshit.      I have been here a few times.  It looks like San Diego or a place you would come in on right off the beach.    The owners are always there and they seem to love what they have created.  They have clams on the menu which I have yet to get to, but so far I have had variations of their Turkey Burger and have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is real friendly, love to talk and have a good time.  They also care about making sure you are being taken care of.  I wish more places in Olde Town had the quality of people, food, and service this place does.

Man, I love gambling here. Put me on a Craps table here and I am ready to go!  Saw Artie Lange here in the joint a few years back and loved it.  He got so drunk he could barely finish his show.  Awesome Artie!!!  Pool is freakin great and I love the bar  right in the center of the casino.  I would come back anytime! Now give me some comps!!!
