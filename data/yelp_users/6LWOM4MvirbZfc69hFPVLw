Walked in to talk to personal banker about closing accounts. He directed me to main counter. Waited 20 minutes in line that went to entrance door to talk to person at counter. They directed me back to personal banker. Took nearly one hour to close out my accounts. Not the type of service I would expect. They mentioned the weekend after the first of the month is always busy. Perhaps time to staff for these occasions if you know they will be busy.

The sea bass is excellent. I haven't had a bad dish. The lunch plates are a great choice as well. Excellent service and food. I set it up on Open Table. You won't be unhappy.   First class service with a warm towel when you are done.

Citrus soy salmon is my favorite. You should try the couscous. Best in town. It's a little noisy but worth the trip. I did my reservation through open table and got on at the time promised. They serve bottomless drinks.

They do not have enough customer service people here. If you don't mind waiting an hour just to talk to someone it might work for you. The store is clean. The people are not wry engaging. The greeter is nice but after he takes your info he drops you and never checks back.

We celebrated my mother in laws 85th birthday here. Tia and wife were kind, friendly, and accommodating. We used their back yard versus bringing them to our house. It's like entering a Hawaiian luau as soon as you walk in. Very clean and professional. They had everything ready and took little or no planning or preparation on our part. The food, service, music, dancing, and fire show were top notch. I'd highly recommend.
