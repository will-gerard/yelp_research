I really like this place! Saw it on Diners Drives Ins and Dives even though I don't really like the show, I still gave it a shot. I'd been craving some better mexican foods because everything I've tasted was... sad. I was pleasantly surprised that this family owned shop was delicious. I love the bombero burrito because the sauce is spicy but still yummy! A lot of hot sauces are just spicy with no yummy.   This has officially become my mex spot. :D

This place was packed on Friday night! Every table was full of happy people getting their kbbq on! It smelt amazing from the get go and we were excited to eat some good Korean food.   We got the daeji bulgogi and the seafood tofu soup. The tofu soup was just the right spice and warmed our bellies. The meat came out sizzling and tasted sweet and spicy. I wished that the meat was cooked a little longer because I like a little char, but still yummy! The only downside was the side dishes. There were only a few that I liked: kimchi, seaweed and the fish cakes. The others were not as exciting like cole slaw and stuff. Not a huge deal though.   I was still really happy with the food and would come back again!

Why have I not been here before? In 3.5 years of living in Arizona, I have been searching for a legit Vietnamese restaurant and this is finally it!   We ordered the duck egg noodle soup and the pork chop, shrimp, beef broken rice. Oh man. The flavors were on point! The broth of the soup was flavorful and yummy. The egg noodles were thin and just the right consistency. The duck was tender and juicy. Warms your belly! All the meats in the rice dish were well seasoned and awesome!  Service was super fast and efficient. I appreciate attentive staff that make sure you get everything you need.  Definitely will be back to try more dishes!! :)

I am addicted to coffee. I know, it's a problem! :D Buuut I wouldn't say I'm an expert. So excuse my own way of describing what I like and don't like.   The coffee here is the perfect "strongness". The taste is perfect for me, strong enough without being bitter and gross. They have a great variety of espresso drinks like mochas, black and whites, mint, etc. All really good. The baristas have quite the showmanship. They are quick, precise, and do some cool tricks as well!   The atmosphere is okay. Fine to study but not exactly cozy to hang out. There is free wifi which is a plus.

I love this place! I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. It is a cool trendy place right in the heart of downtown Gilbert. First, I love that little strip of restaurants. It's a cool area to eat and hang out with Joe's Real BBQ, Oregano's, Farmhouse, etc. On the weekends there's even a little Farmer's Market with cool local finds like jalapeno brittle, flavored popcorn, and artisan crafts.   Liberty Market is really one of a kind with great, interesting, fresh foods awesome coffee and bakery items. It is a must eat in Gilbert! Btw, check out the bathrooms! All of my friends always recommend walking in because of the cool decor! haha kind of a weird thing to say about a place but I agree it's cool! :D

This is one of my favorite starbucks. The people that work here are great! They work quickly and lines go by quick and their super sweet. I love the ample seating and tons and tons of plugs. tons. :D doesn't it make you disappointed when there's nowhere for you to plug in your lappy? well, not here!  I like to come here and study. keeps me focused and the coffee keeps me awake. Also, it's right in the shopping center with whole foods, jimmy johns, qdoba, pita shack, mcdonalds and it's across from smashburger and chipotle. something for every study buddy. :D

The portions here are huge! Usually, mongolian bbq places give you a tiny bowl and I find all kinds of ways to maximize the space but here I pretty much don't need to. (although I still do and I end up with 2 big takeout boxes. haha) besides that, they give you rice and soup. so it's a good deal.  I'll tell you my secret: first you unroll the frozen pieces of meat and you flatten them with your napkin. Cover the bottom of the bowl. then you line broccoli with the heads pointed out of the bowl all around the rim. This makes your bowl bigger. then you pile up everything else you want on top. haha. :D

I just called to ask for an estimate of price and had the poorest customer service in my life. Even if you don't know exactly what needs to be done you can explain the differences in cost over the phone. James was extremely rude and kept cutting me off before I could finish a sentence!!!!  I have never in my life been treated that way by an establishment over the phone. At no point did I raise my voice or ask anything inappropriate. James himself got flustered and hung up the phone. A man like that who claims to give excellent customer service should not be in business.   I come from the service industry and definitely know what it means to respect your customers. I would never ever in my entire life talk to someone like that.   By the way, called many other alterations shops and they were all happy and willing to give me an idea of the cost.   Please do not go here. Ever. It may be more affordable but you get what you pay for.

I was excited to try my first taste of ethiopian food so we drove all the way to Tempe! I ordered the spicy combination with chicken, beef, and lentil stews and my boyfriend go the meat combination which also had the spicy chicken, spicy beef, and a buttery chicken stew. These meals came with something called injera which is like a tortilla like flat bread that is soft, chewy, a bit like sponge texture.  Everything was delicious! My favorite was the spicy chicken stew. The flavor was bold, the chicken was tender, and with the injera was awesome! Overall it reminded me of some of my favorite indian food at punjabi tandoor. The portions were large and the service was great.   Next time, I want to try their tiramisu which won best in the valley!

This was my first time climbing in years so I definitely needed a refresher course. I was a little scared at first because I never belayed for someone before and I didn't wanna drop my friend!! :/ But the staff there was super friendly and really helped me get comfortable with everything.   There were quite a few routes marked to try out. So plenty of fun for hours (or until your arms fall off)! :D What's nice is that you pay $16 for the shoe, harness and day pass and you can come back later that day if you wanna take a break.

This was by far the best cirque show I've seen. The whole show transports you to another world. It's a little eerie and some of the acting is predictable but they have really amazing feats! I was holding my breath half the time.   The stage and all the props were so intricate. It consisted of so many moving parts. At times, people just came underwater seemingly from nowhere. At every scene there was always a ton to look at. Not just the acrobats but side performers as well. Never a dull moment!  We sat in the fifth row and seriously, these were great seats! Completely worth seeing up close.

This place is awesome! It's very quaint as it is a house converted into a restaurant. We sat outside but didn't realize that there had been construction being done on the street. At times it was so loud we just didn't bother to try and repeat what we had said. The other thing was the offensive smell! The dumpster sits right by the parking lot of the restaurant and if you sit outside you get a disgusting whiff of it every once in a while. Very unappetizing.   The food itself is delicious! I got the mele salad which has caramelized walnuts, blue cheese, and apple slices. The dressing perfectly complimented the other ingredients. The pizza was had a delicious crust and ooey gooey cheese. One of the better specialty pizzas I've had.    Definitely would go back and have!

Great food and drinks. On the pricey side but worth it.   I had the Fez Burger that has spicy honey molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, & cilantro on ciabatta. SO GOOD. The food is delicious and the drinks are tasty. Definitely one of the more modern, trendy spots to hang out. :)

I love pizza and salad. Always. :) Sauce has both of those so of course I like it!  First, know that this is not the super greasy, huge, cheesy slices that we also love! The pizza here is more like that on a diet. :D If you aren't into the fresh, light, healthy kinda pizza, then I wouldn't recommend it. I got the Mushroom and arugula pizza which was pretty good! I would say maybe there is too much arugula piled up on top to the point where you feel like you're eating a full on salad. But it's not a big deal to me. Just take some off.   The salads here are pretty good. I like the chicken, pine nuts, tomato, and gorgonzola. I'm don't usually order salad because they don't feel like a meal to me but that one is really good.   I like the style of ordering here although I've read that some people don't like it. It's similar to wildflower, where you line up, look at the menu on the walls and order at the counter. Then, they bring your food to your table along with some rolls if you would like. This is a pretty quick and efficient way of getting your food and the servers are really nice! I was surprised that they even refilled my drinks for me at the self-service fountain.

One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)  This is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!

My first Brazilian BBQ experience!   We were seated promptly and our waiter came by and gave us the rundown. He spoke extremely quickly with a thick accent so honestly... I don't know what he said. Just go with the flow. :)  We went to the salad bar to grab some sides. They had lasagna, salads, crab legs, etc. I wasn't really into any of it because I wanted to save room for MEAT!!! I'm a carnivore. :D I did love the bread. It's like a mochi texture on the inside. delicious!  Then, we flipped the peg to green and it was GO TIME. The meats just started racing out. Little bites of this and that. mMMMmmM it was good. Some of the random things I didn't care for I just didn't eat like the sausage or the drier garlic wings, but I got seconds and thirds of the things I loved like the top sirloin and the bbq smothered drumsticks. I don't know if I ever tried 15 different meats like they said but I was so stuffed it didn't matter!!! Finally, we surrendered and knocked the peg down. This experience definitely turned me on to brazilian bbq. :D nom nom nom!

Boring. Sushi is mediocre. Prices are expensive. Rolls are of low quality and limited on fish. Place is usually empty. Don't even know how they stay a float.   The ambiance is clean and nice. Service was average. Really meh and not somewhere I would head back to unless prices were more reasonable.

Ahhhh! Finally some real thai food!  I've been searching for a decent thai place since I moved to AZ and this is it! All the dishes are real quite good. I actually brought my Thai friend there who is picky about his Thai food and even he said the food was good and pretty authentic! The portions are really big and the food is inexpensive. Service isn't always the best but honestly, I'm there for the food! :D   if you are ever in the area, definitely give Thai House a try.

This place is dirty. Service is slow. People are rude. That being said... It's like any other true chinese restaurant! :) I felt the food was pretty authentic. They didn't stray too far from originals. They had a huge selection so there will be something for everyone there. If you aren't used to bustling restaurants or loud talking or slightly questionable sanitation then I wouldn't come here.   Overall, food is pretty good just ambiance and service could be improved.

I came here with some friends when I first moved to AZ. We'd heard a lot about it so I was excited to try it. I had the Fontina Burger and shared a bunch of sides. The burger was pretty good but standard to me like Smashburger or five guys. What got me really excited were the sides!! the onion rings were crispy fried goodness. They were probably my favorite thing there. The sweet potato fries were good too. The right amount of crisp. I really liked the food but nothing stood out in my mind as something I crave and dieeee for.   Overall a good pick for lunch.

Yay! this place is surprisingly good! :D With all the bad mexican food i've had since I moved to AZ I was really really happy to find this place. The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. I ordered the Killer Burrito with pollo asado. So yummy! You could tell that all the ingredients were fresh; from the tortilla to the guac that rocks to the perfectly seasoned chicken (not too salty and not too bland). We also got a carne asada burrito enchilada style. The carne asada was also really tender and moist not dry and hard to swallow like some other places. The red sauce was also really really flavorful and good.   I asked the waiter for some hot sauce and he offered up tapatio which is decent. But then he surprised me with salsa with some habanero in it. oh man! I love spicy foods so that really hit the spot and also gave him some brownie points for going above and beyond.   The location of the place is also in a cool area of downtown Mesa. Nearby is a bit rundown but right along Main street is kind of a cool place to walk around with a guitar shop, piano shop, sweet cakes bakery, the monsterland bar and grill (which is on my list of to dos :D), etc.   Yummy food, great service, great experience!

White lotus has become my regular salon and I love it. I've gotten great haircuts, love the products they use, friendly fun people, and a beautiful clean ambiance. Lindsay is great! She's a really sweet person that takes her time evaluating what you want and what will look good. If you're in the market for a new hair stylist, give white lotus a try! :)

This is a really nice salon with very reasonable prices. I came in for a haircut and I have long thick hair. They did a great job and really took their time to shampoo, massage, cut, and blow out. At $40, I was pleasantly surprised and loved my haircut. The salon itself it beautiful. Very trendy and clean.

Usually pho places are pretty dirty :( but I guess the dirtier the more flavor? :) But I was surprised because it is such a nicely decorated, clean restaurant!  This place is yummy. The broth has a much fuller taste then others I've tried in the area. The meat is tender and delicious. The spring rolls are fresh and delicious and a good size. All in all it is delicious!

i finally tried this place yesterday with a friend and I don't get the hype.I have had a lot of sushi in my life so forgive me if I might be too harsh.   i got the "get clucked" roll and my friend got the "dam jumper" roll.  First off, the portions were tiny! When the dinky rolls came out, my friend and I both gave each other a knowing look. My poor friend is a big guy and he just looked downright sad. (We got burgers after thankfully). Second, the rice was soggy and mushy. Really unappetizing. The get clucked roll was doused in sweet and sour sauce which only made the mushy-ness of the rice worse.  I can't speak much about the dam jumper roll because I didn't try it other than to say it was depressingly small.   On the up side, the service was great. Extremely attentive, helpful, friendly. Everything you could ask for. The ambiance is nice: clean, modern, with an ipad on the table to order and a huge projector screen. For these reasons, I couldn't give the place only 1 star (but come on... this is based on food right?)

The times I've been here I've come for birthday parties and group dinners but really, it's a much better place for small groups. It gets really busy and loud. You might have to wait a little for dinner.  The food is good, cheesecake is delicious and service is okay. (With service, sometimes you'll get the most caring, attentive server or at other times someone who only comes to bring food and give you the check. eh. Not that big a deal to me. :)) Most of all I love love love that brown bread in the basket. Oo. :D I get 2nds of that all the time. :)   be wary, this place is pricey and isn't always worth what you pay but it's still good!

This is a great little place to visit. I love going for runs outdoors and this place is cool to explore. There's lots of vegetation, wildlife and water! Which is a change of scenery in Arizona. Lots of people were fishing but I wouldn't trust what you catch in those ponds. :/  It's a nice place to go for a stroll and explore!

Went last night on the guestlist and it was such a scam. They only allow you to stay outside and you can't go inside unless you pay. We were told by a promoter that we could just pay and cut the entrance line since we were already technically inside.  Once we got there, they told us that we had to wait 2-3 hours. The entrance line is long but only artificially. They purposely don't let anyone in until around 12 because they want you to get frustrated with the line. The shark of promoters then circle waiting for you to try and bribe them to bring you up front and they charge whatever they want for that. One guy told us to pay him $100 + entrance fees for one guy and one girl $60. Then another said $140 + $60. Crazy.   Finally this super sketch guy came up and told us $100 for all entrance and he would walk us up the VIP line. He wanted the money up front but we weren't having it. Waited until he literally walked us in the club with all the stamps then slipped him the $100.   Omg such a scam!!!! And the other thing is that the party really doesn't go down until 1:30am! David guetta and the epic light shows don't come on til then.   But I gotta say, when he came on it was freaking worth all the hassle. The place was jumping off the walls insane. The music was good. The show was awesome! I figure it's like paying $50/person for a concert which IMO isn't too bad.    Good luck out there. It's a frenzy.

I hate to do this to a mom and pop type of business but I have to say... don't eat here! I got the Salmon Teriyaki Plate for $9.29 including tax and it is just a sad, sad dish. There is a very small piece of salmon which is overally salty, a scoop of rice which is undercooked and tastes old, and a salad of lettuce with a little carrot on top.   Maybe the sushi is better although I have my doubts.  btw, still hungry!!!!!

This place was a nice surprise! Really fresh and modern. The food is a great new take on Mexican flavors. Every single thing I ordered was delicious and I couldn't change a thing.  Everyone was so friendly and inviting. Loved the ambiance. Even though I ordered to go and they had a whole room filled with customers, they still took the time to make recommendations and even offer me water as I waited. Really nice!

Came here using a groupon now deal $3 for $6 and I was pretty surprised about how great it was.   It is just like yogurt world in SoCal where you have 15-20 different self serve frozen yogurts. Then, you add whatever toppings your heart desires! Fruit, mochi, cereals, chocolates etc.   Btw, My friend and I split and we got almost exactly under $6! Sweet! Haha.   I think there is still the $3 for $6 deal so definitely get that before you go!

Terrible. Absolutely terrible.   First, adjusted the hem and the slit in the dress. Afterward, I decided that the top was too loose so we shortened the straps. Due to the shortening the end was too short. The owner offered to lengthen the hem to make up for the difference which was nice.   When I came back to try it on, I was unhappy with the hem because the liner and the end of the dress had a weird step in it. The owner wasn't available so I had to return the next day. When I came back to let the owner know and see what we could do to fix it she got worked up before I could even say what was wrong. She said, "you don't need to try it on again." She just wanted me to take the dress and leave. Honestly, I do need to try it on so you can see what's wrong. Once we figure out how to fix it, then we do! We decided to lengthen the liner to make the step less noticeable. I paid her $20 and left.   On my way out, she called me back inside, gave me my money back and told me she wasn't going to do it. I didn't understand what happened. I didn't say any mean words, I didn't criticize her. I just wanted to fix the dress. I let her know what was wrong, we agreed on how to fix it, paid for the alteration and then she felt unhappy? I know she is a nice person, but she had her guard up before I said anything. Maybe it was the day she was having, but I'm moving on and will never come back here again.

I always feel like a whale after I eat this but I can't help myself. So good. Line gets long here around lunch but service is quick so it goes by really fast. I love the burrito bowl options because it tricks my body into taking in salad as a meal (although I wouldn't really compare it to a salad haha).

Ahhh! I'm addicted to Chick-Fil-A!!!  I finally tried this place after hearing so many good things and I'm hooked. The first week I tried it.. I think I had it 4 times. haha. (Kinda embarrassing to say :X)   I usually get the spicy chicken sandwich with all the fixin's and eat it with chick fil a sauce and buffalo. mmmmmm. The chicken is a huge piece and it's fried perfect! (Actually one time, it was way overdone. I let them know and they immediately cooked me a fresh one. I hope it didn't have spit in it, although they are so friendly and nice I doubt they would do something like that... or would they?)  The crisscut fries are soooo good. You can tell the oil they fry it in is fresh. They give you great service, it's clean and nice, they give you great extras, and they have community family events. Just feels like a wholesome place to be. :)

I encountered this place when I went to the Phoenix Rock Gym and was excited to try it! I moved here from California not too long ago and was missing the delicious ramen places back home. I got the Republic Ramen and a black milk tea with boba. The people who work there are excellent! Great service, quick, and really friendly. The style is kinda modern with a cool hang out vibe. (not sure if that is a thing but I'm making it one :))  The republic ramen was tasty. It is a little spicy. Comes with 5 or 6 slices of the meat of your choice, fresh spinach, and fresh bean sprouts. I thought the flavor was decent but missing a little something savory about it, but still overall good. I might be a little skewed because I haven't had ramen for a while and was craving it. But, I would definitely go back.  The boba was the highlight for me. The tapioca balls were a perfect balance of chew not old and hard like most of the places around here. The milk tea was a perfect amount of sweet unlike other bobas that make me feel like one sip and I'll go into instant diabetic shock.   Overall I love this place!

In the past I might've given Babe's a 3 or even 4-star review BUT this last time ruined my experience!   I'll start with the good. Every Wednesday they have a 25 cent wing day which is awesome especially since they are so close to where I live and go to school. They have a ton of flat screens so you could be watching a music video, baseball game, basketball game, tv etc. all at once! I really enjoy the honey hot wings which are saucey all over, juicy, and decent overall.   Now... comes the bad. The service is always sub-par!! :/ I hate to give them a bad review based on this but my recent visit was the absolute last straw. Every time we've come, there has been a mix up of the orders, something missing, drinks left unfilled, etc. It's pretty frustrating! It's kind of amazing that you could ask for ketchup 3 times and still not get it even after you've finished all your fries. This last time, we walked in and stood there for a few minutes with no acknowledgment when the place wasn't even that busy. So we assumed that maybe we should sit down? We sat... and sat.... and saaaat. Still no one. I even waved to a waitress and nothing? Finally, we gave up and just left.   Idk what it is. Maybe they were swamped or something but honestly, there could be some improvements.

The sandwiches are tasty! The portions are huge, fries are delish and the service is pretty good. The counter display in the front is a little sad but everything else was great. This is a great place for me because its close by and quick. No more fast food junk. Yay! Be sure to mention yelp and get half off a second full sandwich. :D

I have been here a couple times now and it's definitely a place to check out.  As so many yelpers have already mentioned, the chopped salad is delicious. Definitely something to try at Citizen. Also, the pastrami!!! Oh man, that was so melt in your mouth yummy! Smaller portion, probably not a meal for most but it was so good I would order it again. The lamb burger is a huge meal that comes with perfectly crispy scrumptious fries. The patty isn't cut down with beef or pork so the flavor is very game-y which can be a good thing if you are into that. I wasn't quite so used to it. :) I also tried a bit of my friend's Smart Chicken which was amazingly tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned! Also, really organic and fresh which I love. I tried the Citi-zen mixed drink which was very lemony and a bit on the sour side. I wasn't in love with the flavor. I did however love the rock candy that came with it. lol.  The service was awesomeeeeee!!! We came in near closing but they still happily sat us instead of shooing us away. Our waiter was very attentive, answered all our questions about the menu and made some great suggestions. He also took us on a tour of the speak easy style bar upstairs which was super interesting! Apparently you go around the side of the building and there's a posting of "the rules". You call the number and if they have room you will be let up to this chic modern bar. All the mixologists make special drinks from their own liquors. Really cool!

Came here and was confused by the setup. Felt like we came in through a back door in someone's house. There was nice decoration but it felt a bit dirty inside.   I ordered the chia seed drink and I loved it! The textures were fun and it tasted very sweet. It was something I had before as a child but I forgot all about it. It was very nostalgic for me.   I also got the meat combination plate. It came out beautifully decorated. Each of the meats had a nice sweet caramelization without compromising the flavor of the meat. The blackened chicken was my favorite. It had so much juicy flavor that I couldn't help but to get down on it with my hands.   Overall delicious food, smaller portions, moderate prices, low ambiance.

The frozen yogurt here is pretty tasty. i had the tart peach which is delicious and topped it with strawberries and blueberries. Tasted really refreshing and hit the spot for my cravings. The only thing for me is that there is a small selection. I'm used to self serve yogurt places with 10 or more flavors but here there isn't quite so many. Besides that, the yogurt here is yum yum yummy! :)

I'm amazed to find a place like this in AZ!! I was ranting and raving about it for days because it really surprised me how good it could be.   When I went there, I got so excited I ordered AALLL of my favorites. Got the green onion pancake (delish), egg and chive dumplings (yummy!), potstickers (pretty good), freshly made dumplings (so good).   The staff there was really friendly and sweet. Real Chinese people making the dumplings right in the front so you know it's fresh! it's not the cleanest place and the menu might be confusing if you haven't had this type of food before but this would be a good place to try something new! :D

I am addicted to this stuff. I've tried many of the acai bowls and loved each one. It's just fresh and yummy. Really quite filling with the granola on top. I've had them for meals sometimes. The small bowl is enough to make me full but if you want to try it at a meal, I'd bump it up to medium. Large is way too much for one person!

My boyfriend found this place online and we decided to feed my burger craving tonight. The place is fairly new (12 weeks) so we were excited to try it. The place is really clean and new. The servers were friendly and helpful.   We sat down and were offered a sample of the apple fries. Zomg. Delicious. They are basically fresh apple slices fried and dressed like a churro with caramel sauce and whipped cream. So so good. I would come here just for that. :D   First, the firehouse dog was made for me. Juicy beef sausage, fresh jalapeños, banana peppers, onions and omg the chipotle sauce. If I were to design my own this would be it!!   The Giovanni burger was also so good. The sweet peppers were delicious and I always love mushrooms.   The chili cheese fries were pretty good. The fries themselves were very crispy. Just how I like em. You could tell the chili was fresh with beans and tomatoes. Not too cheesy.   Overall, this place is a great local find in Mesa. I'm definitely gonna be back. :D

Gordon Ramsay may be hyped up on tv but his restaurant definitely lives up to it. The restaurant is location in the Paris Hotel right through the casino to the left. There's a huge pillar with his name on it and a cool lighted decorative awning at the entrance. The entire restaurant is beautiful full of simple colors, modern industrial feel and contemporary art.   The hostess that lead us to our seat gave a brief introduction to the hotel and pointed out a big lighted red centerpiece of the restaurant that represented the motions Gordon makes while making his famous beef Wellington.   The restaurant offers a cool set "Hell's Kitchen" 5-course menu for $145 that includes his famous beef Wellington, sticky toffee pudding and risotto (which is only available on this set meal). Unfortunately, the whole table has to do the HK menu for timing and not everyone was as hungry as me!  The bread plate that came out was amazing with specialty breads such as lemon, cheese, truffle, bacon. Each had an amazing texture and I couldn't stop eating them! I ended up getting a beef Wellington with Brussel sprouts and truffle Mac n cheese as sides. Every item was done deliciously. The beef was incredibly tender and juicy. It was full of flavor and a quality meat. The portion size was healthy and I couldn't even finish all the delicious steak. All of the sides were also delicious. I don't even like Brussel sprouts and I couldn't get enough of them. The truffle flavor was strong in the Mac n cheese unlike some others I've tried and it was the perfect cheesiness.   The sticky toffee pudding was delicious but a bit sweet. I was really more impressed with the brown butter ice cream that came on the side. It's simply not a flavor that I would've chosen off the bat but it went some perfectly with the toffee pudding! I couldn't eat much of this dessert because it was so rich and I was super stuffed already!  Must come back and try that risotto!

Quaint little place next to p.croissant. They've got a bunch of savory and sweet creeps as well as some damn good coffee. The ingredients are all so fresh it makes it easy to love. I had ordered the duck Cuban but they were completely out of duck. We switched it up without any problem and they gave me a dessert on the house for the trouble. Really great customer service. Far exceeded my expectations. Everyone who works there is nice, chill and helpful.

Bleh! I really wanted to like this place but no.   I got the beet burger and a slice of pie. The buns were store bought. It had no taste other than mayo. The beets were fine but I couldn't understand why anyone would choose to eat this. It's sad and sucks.   The pie was decent but nothing is go crazy over. The crust tasted either premade or just sucky.   Overall was just an okay experience. Don't get the hype.

I really didn't like the food here. I came here as people told me this was really good Mexican. Honestly, it's more like tex-mex. I thought food was bland, dry, boring. I've had way better elsewhere with bigger portions for the same price. If I wanted tex-mex I would rather go to Nando's.

Hiked this trail for the first time today! It's an awesome hike about 40 minutes up and maybe 30 down. It's pretty rocky and some areas you have to climb up some big rocks which is really fun! There were tons of dogs on the trail which is really cool. Love a dog friendly trail! It is a busier trail so if you're looking for a secluded area, this isn't the trail for you.   In terms of parking, it gets pretty packed on the street so you might have to walk a bit even before you get to the trailhead. There's plenty of spaces so don't get discouraged looking for a spot.   Overall, a great moderate hike if your looking for some variation to get some exercise. :)

Tried this place for the first time. I got the beef kabob with brown rice and naan and my boyfriend got the lamb with spinach rice and the salad bar. Both dishes were delicious! The beef kabob was tender and juicy with a full flavor. Loved the green sauce that came with it. It was spicy but fresh. The lamb definitely tasted like lamb unlike some other places that over season the meat and mask its original flavor. The salad bar had many different toppings with even pickled vegetables like brusslesprouts, garlic and carrots.  I didn't see the $20 for $25 deal until after we already paid but the owner was so awesome he gave us a large slice of baklava  on the house. The baklava tasted homemade and fresh. Just the perfect sweetness to hit the spot. The owner also brought out a savory dumpling dish for us to try which was like ravioli. Such a great guy!  I wish this place well. They are off to a great start!   Had to update my review. I called in a order for pick up and this girl on the phone was so rude and dumb. I met her in person and she was even worse! She has to go!!!

Delicious!!! This place is located in the oldest rundown looking plaza, but it looks totally different once you get inside! The decoration is super cute and bright with light pastels, jars of homemade candy like hand pulled toffee and lollipops. The smells of fresh baked good overwhelmed me and made my mouth water! It was my first visit so I got a free cake bite. These are basically little flat chocolate covered cake pieces. I got the cinnamon churro which was delicious! It has a denser consistency than cake but the taste is amazing. Too bad I was too full to try any of the cupcakes but I shall return!!! and then update my review... :)
