Best hot dogs on the left coast! Forget about Pinks. These dogs are insane. I recommend the kimchi fries..... Ridiculously good! The owners are way chill, and you can tell they love what they do. It's a must every time I'm in Vegas.

These donuts are not just for trendy- Oregon based hipsters and would-be food bloggers. These are honest to goodness delicious donuts with a few brave flavors for the most daring of pastry lovers. I recommend the Elvis!  Peanut butter, banana and bacon:)

Don't let the odd name fool ya. This is some Legit Mexican food! We had fish tacos, and I tried the lengua and cabeza tacos, as well. It's as good and as authentic as any I've tried. The real star of this place is their fresh fruit. This is an homage to Mexican street food. With fresh fruit cocktails and shaved ices, all with homemade syrup. (I recommend the walnut.) I will be back again and again. Maybe that's why they call it that. Now I get it!

With all the great restaurants in this area, it is hard not to get caught up in the relaxing and hip atmosphere of downtown Gilbert. If you are looking more for a loud restaurant that overcharges for lackluster breakfast food, look no further than Lo-Lo's.     Our second visit to Lo-Lo's started out better than the first time. But for the life of me I can not figure out why a restaurant that just pops some eggos in the toaster can take so long. (Eggo waffles are actually tastier) once we found a nice black hair in my wife's potatoes that was the breaking point. They were kind enough to comp us for the hairy potatoes, but then allowed thirty minutes to pass before we got the check. Even with a comped meal our bill was 38 bucks! For some koolaid and some dry waffles! Stay home, save your money.
