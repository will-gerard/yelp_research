These donuts were delish.  I started with the donut holes which were light and airy.  Vegan?  Who can tell.  The kicker were were the apple filled "cannolis"  I don't know what they're called but they apple filling was wrapped by this pastry which is adorned with sugar and cinnamon.  Someone called it an apple Burrito.  That'll work.  In any case, this was excellent.  Service was great as the owners were very sweet and helpful.  The place is non descript in a strip mall but well worth the trip.

Rich, thick and creamy.  Who knew that custard can taste so good.  I was expecting something eggy and flan-ish.  My buddy told me about this place but I went in blind not reading any reviews.  They've got multiple flavors and frozen custard has such a thick consistency.  Definitely worth a try especially on those hot summer days in Vegas.  This place is not in the most savory of neighborhoods so don't try to walk there, Take your car and be safe.

Every time I go to Vegas which seems like every 2 months, I have to have my fix of Aloha Specialties.  I'm just a creature of habit but I like the food here.  The poke is fresh and the portions generous.  I love their Korean Chicken as well as the local plate.  This is how plate lunch tastes in back in Hawaii.  The saimin is good and this place beats anything we have in LA.  Stop there when you get a chance and enjoy the food.  Service is good except you have to wait to order from the counter.

Okay, I"m not a huge Neiman Marcus fan.  It's a little too fashionable for moi.  I'm more of a shorts, jeans, and t-shirt guy.  But damn, they have some of the best collections of fashion designers for purses, accessories, etc.  But more importantly, the men's room is one of the nicest I've ever been in a department store.  For that...5 stars and woot woot from me.

As far as buffets go, this is one of the best I've been to.  Nothing that we tried had that institutional flavor-even the fried chicken was good. A word of advice, if you're going to the Wynn to try the buffet, then gamble there first and sign up for the red card.  When you get 150 points, you can cash them in for 2 free buffets.  Now onto the food.  Soups were excellent.  They had 3 chowders-manhattan, new england, and corn.  We had the manhattan and new england and they were very good.  they had gazpacho which looked good but I had to save room for the other stuff.  Prime Rib-excellent.  Lamb Chops-dry and tough.  Alaskan King Crab Legs-Excellent-not your tiny legs you see most everywhere else.  The asian food was excellent you would have thought they had a Chinese cook on staff.  Salads were very good particularly the ones in the glasses.  The seaweed salad was the bomb. I love their chocolate mousse brownie along with the ice cream.  The creme brulee was awesome according to the wife.   I highly recommend the saturday night faire.  definitely worth the money.

I took my parents to Vegas for the weekend on the condition that they eat wherever I take them because we were going to be yelping.  They agreed and said they'd be up for the adventure and assist on the reviews.  Our first stop was the Hash House.  It's a little ways down Sahara to the normal part of Vegas.  Ambience is cool with the stainless steel tables and very casual and clean environment.  As we were getting seated, we couldnt' help but notice the portions.  They're gargatuan...almost in the same class as Belisle's in Anaheim for you old timers.   We sat down and ordered our drinks.  The wife had the plain old lemonade which she claims was one of the best she's ever had.  She didn't try the kiwi watermelon which is award winning.  We decided to order 2 meals for 4 peeps and split.  The waitress mentioned a 2.50 charge for the extra plate so she suggested getting a couple of sides so we opted for breakfast sausage. The first platter was their signature corned beef hash.  Made with their corned beef cut into strips and tossed with red onions, brown onions, and green onions, this corned beef hash was excellent. The 2nd platter was a bacon avocado scramble and this was delicious.  These 2 platters and the sides of sausage were more than enough to satiate our morning hunger.   Service was great and this is definitely a local place.  Highly recommend if you're a breakfast lover.

Top notch customer service and well appointed rooms.  It took some figuring out how to close the drapes and use the lights but I got it done.  Bed was super cozy and loved the decor throughout.  The casino was nowhere half as lively as the Wynn.  I didn't have any issues checking in although they could be a bit more organized with the lines.  I'd stay here again.

Went here for breakfast.  Service was excellent with coffee flowing and the waiter checking in from time to time.  Coffee is Farmer Bros. which is one of my faves with breakfast.  My folks had an omelet while I had chicken fried chicken.  I thought I was going to get a chicken fried steak but I misread the menu and didn't realize it was actually a chicken cutlet.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The gravy was tasty and the chicken cooked perfectly.  I also tried the wife's french toast which were light and fluffy.  This place is in the Golden Gate Casino and parking is a bitch unless you valet.  What's even better is that it doesn't have a casino feel.  Highly recommend.  PS..the banana cream pie is the best I've ever had.

Hopefully, the organizers get their act together and limit the crowd before the competitors run out of food. We got there around 2:00, got in line and waited about 20 minutes when a staffer comes out with a bullhorn telling everyone that they're not selling anymore tickets until 4 pm because they ran out of food.   Unfortunately, the organizers didn't anticipate such a turnout.  I was so looking forward to this event since I was in town for spring training.  Anyway, hopefully next year will be better.
