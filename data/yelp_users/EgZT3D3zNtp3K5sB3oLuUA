This was my favorite Chinese restaurant, and unfortunately they closed on October 15, 2013.  They are no longer in business.

I don't know how they manage to take the flavor out of the food, but they do it better than any Chinese food restaurant I've ever been to. We ordered Seafood Soup, which literally tasted like chunks of imitation crab and assorted vegetables in water rather than broth. I don't even remember what I had as the entree, it was that forgettable. This place is set up for take out and they have a wide assortment of sauce packets that you pick right out of the boxes they were shipped in. I guess you're supposed to add your own flavor by grabbing handfuls of those. I suggest you use both fists. I will never go back.

I had never heard of this place until I saw their sign go up in my neighborhood.  I've never had Scandinavian cuisine before and was anxious to try it.  I got on their website and read some very excellent reviews from prestigious food critics, and having just had my first lunch there, I couldn't agree more.  Their new bistro has Swedish decor and everything is brand new.  Very nice atmosphere for dining.  The owner is adorably charming and she personally greeted us and spent time with all of the customers.  She was very hospitable and makes it a point to explain the origins of anything on the menu you have questions about.  The food was spectacular!  I had the Pork Schnitzel Cordon Bleu and my wife had the Salmon burger with Swedish Shrimp Salad.  Each dish came with a choice of 3 side salads and a side dish.  It sounds like a lot of food but the side portions are small and designed to give a nice variety to your palate.  I can't say enough about the quality of the food.  It tasted very homemade and you could tell that a lot of time goes into the preparation.  They also have a large selection of bottled European beers.  As we were leaving we overheard the owner (Hanna) say, "I'd rather have 20 happy customers than 100 unhappy customers."  I would encourage those who have given a bad review to give them another try in this new location.  Their menu is new and they are adding to it once the dishes are "perfected".  By the way, the owner was born in Poland, raised in Sweden, and spent many years in Montreal, Quebec.  The beaver is the national animal of Canada, hence the unusual name "Beaver Choice".
