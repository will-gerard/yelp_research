What a great store, not only are you completely ignored from staff, but they are pretty understaffed or lazy.  Unfortunately I have been waiting in the appliance area for about half an hour to buy a washer and not one person is there to help me buy it.  They are busy helping other customers who "want" to buy whereas I already am ready to buy.  This is the unfortunate result of customer service from monopolistic companies.

This place was great.  I went with a friend who has a baby boy and they were accommodating with a high chair even though we didn't ask for one.  The only reason this was not 5 stars was because we went on a Saturday at 6pm and the place was packed.  We had to wait 25 minutes before getting a table for 6.  Also, the parking was full, which added to the wait time.  There is a valet attendant, who was a bit helpful.  Now, onto the food!  We stared with the baked chicken wings and it tasted hot and fresh.  It came with a fair amount veggies (celery sticks and blueberries) as well.  We ordered the Mushroom Party w/ chicken sausage, Classic Margherita, and Mother Earth.  Mushroom Party was just okay.  I love mushrooms, but the flavors didn't grab my taste buds as the other two did.  Classic Margherita was my favorite.  The tomatoes and their sauce was a great fusion of flavors despite not having any meat.  Hint: use the parmesan to enhance the cheese flavor even more.  The Mother Earth was also tasteful if you are a fan of broccoli and olives.  One of us had a cheese allergy, so we had this one without cheese and it still tasted great.  We shared the the Duvel Golden Ale growler which was much cheaper than each of us ordering an individual pint.  It was enough for about 5 and a half glasses.  So, 16 bucks vs 6 bucks a pint.  Which would you prefer?  Overall, great atmosphere and would recommend you give it a try.  Service was attentive with drinks and boxes despite the large crowd and customers were not to rowdy or out of control.  This place works for both social or family outings.

I had dinner at this place for a friend's birthday get together.  I always wondered about it while eating at Pho Avina next door a few times.  This is the third time I have ever eaten at a Korean restaurant and I it felt authentic.  From the wooden benches and tabletops to the lightly decorated pieces of art and plants, it felt like a mom and pops' place. The front signage CHK light was either off or not working.  I ordered Nakji Bokum mild.  It is a stir-fried octopus veggie dish.  It came on a sizzling platter and although the veggie assortment (mostly jalapenos and onions) were a disappointment, I loved the octopus.  The white rice was served in a personal-sized metal bowl, which was unusual.  It was really spicy, beyond what I could take, but downing a few glasses of lemon ice water quickly restored the flavors.  Complimentary sides (spicy cabbage, regular cabbage, broccoli, lotus root in heavy syrup, yams) and were always refreshed and the waitress was accommodating.  I give it a notch lower because of the higher price tag and apparently, mild means a bit on the spicy side for them.  Korean food is not my thing, but this place is good for Korean food enthusiasts.

This place nestled in near a Sprouts shopping center is probably one of the most authentic Cantonese food restaurants out here in Phoenix.  Outstanding food and not too salty.  Try the dumpling vegetable soup to start. Use the bowl to eat your main dishes and rice. Try these 3 plates: beef and chicken tofu, Peking duck, and walnut shrimp.  Delicious and definitely not expensive for each plate and serves maybe 4 or 5.    Cash only so be prepared.  You do not need a reservation. Are you kidding? The service is very friendly but understaffed.

Got a mango banana smoothie. Up to 4 flavors per drink. Branch chain amino acids were an extra 50 cents. Total price was $6.50. Punch cards with the 10th smoothie free. I would not frequent often enough to get one. It is a quick pick me up next to LA Fitness when you are in a pinch.

I went to this place with some co-workers during Wednesday lunch hour.  I ordered the Thai Chicken on whole wheat regular crust.    The ingredients, sliced carrots and bean sprouts, while fresh kept falling off because it was just sprinkled on the top.  Overall, I finished it, but something about the sweet paste didnn't really match what you'd expect on a pizza.  I am just used to having salty pizzas.  The waitress was not attentive and did not refill my iced tea.  Not until we were leaving did she offer to fill it with water when I was just chewing the ice because I was just so thirsty.

Their sushi is really good.  We got the Hawaiian roll with the seered albacore tuna.  The flavor was really good and held up to the wasabi.  The warm baked salmon roll with sour cream was even better.  Teriyaki roll was just okay.  The service was just plain bad.  When you only order 3 dishes and all you have to do is take an order and deliver one dish for each person.  What do you do on your free time?  Surely not forget my miso soup and forget to give me my wasabi.  There were a total of 4 tables to attend to for 2 waitresses.  I had to tell the waitress about refilling my tea and bringing my wasabi midway through my dish when I could not stand being thirsty.  The older lady got sounded agitated when I asked her about the soy paper for some strange reason and said it was an extra dollar.  I told her I was just wondering...jeez!  Nevertheless, they did not deserve any tip, but we did tip around 7%.  We are ordering take out from now on.  They have good food and this latest visit was just bad compared to other previous mediocre visits.

I went to try this place out on a Monday, Memorial Day, the last day for Arizona Restaurant Week.  I have never tried fondue and this gave me a great opportunity.  The deal was choose from a cheddar or cheese artichoke fondue for the starter, a the main course fondue, and the classic or dark chocolate fondue for dessert.  All this for 30 bucks per person and add 6.95 for the cooking style.  The place was dark and was playing classic music from the fabulous fifties.  The place was just the opposite of busy.  I really did not even need to make a reservation.    On with the food.  The spinach cheese artichoke was creamy and thick.  Croutons, tortilla chips, cauliflower, apples were dipped and savoured.  Highly recommend.    The main course consisted of about 4 pieces of sirloin teriyaki, pork, chicken breast, 2 spinach ravioli, and shrimp.  We chose the Coq Au Vin cooking style that had wine, mushrooms, and broccoli.  Cooking them was such an adventure.  Something about dipping a stick in a hot metal bowl so simple yet so interactive.  The "stew" really did its job of just cooking the food.  The total time to cook each meaty piece was around 2-3 minutes.  The six different dressings were what really gave the zest.  We also got  a lobster tail with lemon butter dipping sauce for an added 10 bucks.  It was worth it because how often do people ever eat lobster fondue?  The chocolate fondue dessert was delicious because I have a sweet tooth, but unremarkable.  Rice crispies, a slice of cheesecake, giant marshmellows, bannana slices, and strawberries were among the dippers.  The total bill was 60pp, even with the restuarant week discount.  But, the experience and the attentiveness of the waitress compensated for it overall.  I compare the fondue for the main course to be similar to "Hot Pot" because of table top cooking, but the food fusion is much different.  I recommend this place for date night or a special occasion.  It is quiet enough to carry conversations.  Other than that happy hour is the other time I would ever come here because of the prices.

Went here for the first time on a first date.  Great ambiance.   Low lighting, the customers were not loud, almost to a murmur allowing us to actually hear each others conversations.  Parking is validated for 2 hours.  There are 2 lots just south of the restaurant at the Biltmore.  She ordered the Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin off of the gluten free menu.  She liked it a lot.  I ordered the seasonal rock fish snapper with curry sauce.   I asked for the curry to be on the side thinking it was spicy.  The fish was tender, not a lot of seasoning, which is the way fish is supposed to be enjoyed.  The sauce was not at all spicy so I used it for some added flavor.  String beans, yellow squash, carrots, onions, and basmati (brown rice).  It was delicious.  The service was great. Linda was her name, older lady who always stopped by to ask how we were doing.  She didn't treat me like a total newbie because I've never been there.  Even though we skipped appetizers, any of the wines, she didn't treat us any different.  She brought a tray of desserts, I got the seasonal Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Snap Crust.  Small portion, but very tasteful not too sweet.  She ordered the Raspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli.  She discarded the gluten Cannoli part.  Overall, it was a great atmosphere.  It was a casual dining experience without the pressure to order things.  Of course more importantly, the not too skimpy but not too overbearing dishes were delicious.  Dinner - 2 entrees, 2 desserts plus taxes: ticket $48.  Not too bad.

Colleague and I went for lunch. This was a trendy place. Hostess opened the door for us. Waiter immediately serviced on drinks and info on menu items and specials.  Ordered smoked salmon rilette for appetizer. It was delicious, however the grilled bread was too hard to chew.  Ordered the turkey sloppy joe. Ground turKey was a good value, very saucy and flavorful. Wait staff was busy but made time for refills and condiment needs.   I would recommend going just before the rush weekdays to get an immediate table, especially if you are not within walking distance. They validate parking too.
