Yum Yum Yum!  OMG, so awesome!  Great concept.  Would love to see more GF/Vegan options but no complaints as what we ordered was delicious.  Breakfast wrap was altered to accomodate my food choices.    OJ was worth the $3!

Free cookie if you check in with yelp!  YES please.  I got the vegan peanut butter cookie which was wonderful.  I made the mistake of getting a donut though and it was no bueno. :(  I'm sure they have other tasty items but I struck out big time!

Exceptional Indian food.  My food was very spicy--just how I like it!   Lots of vegetarian options which is so necessary when eating Indian food.    You have to pay for your rice which I thought was unusual at a restaurant like this and we did need an order for each entree we purchased.     Perfect vegetable Samosas! Yummy chana masala!
