Great food with great selections of tap beer here.  The only thing that bothered me a lot is that our waiter is really inpatient. This wait staff with blue hat has no smile at all during the whole two-hour dinner service, and makes all three of us feel that he's trying his very best to kick us out as soon as possible. Not showing any customer service at all.

Very authentic Thai food.  The Tom-Ka has lots of ingredients in it. I order the Pad-See Yew with pork with five star spice and it tastes so good. Nice portion.  Our group also ordered Spicy noodle and royal curry, both of those dishes are delicious with nice presentation and portion as well.  Will def come back!
