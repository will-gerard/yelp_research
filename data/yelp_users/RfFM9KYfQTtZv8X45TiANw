Found this place on Yelp and decided to order take out. Ordered a pizza and a meatball appetizer. Person over the phone said my order would take 30-35 minutes. Showed up after 35 minutes to pick up my food and sat there and waited an additional 20 minutes before it came out.     The staff was friendly but the operation was sloppy. No one seemed to have a specific role, they were all just all over the place. I asked twice if my food was ready and both times they told me it was coming out. There was a few tables of families in the place but not enough to justify 55 minutes for a pizza.    Anyways... Got home with my food and was excited to try it out. Meatballs seemed like that sat for a while. The cheese had hardened and the meatballs were a little dry. The pizza I ordered had spinach, tomato, feta cheese, sausage & Italian beef. Way too much spinach. Barely any meat. The pizza dough was soggy, I couldn't hold a slice with my hands I had to use a fork. And it cost me $31. Don't mind paying for quality food but I would like the quality in paying for.     I wouldn't waste my time with this place.

I'm giving 1 star since the service is good. The food itself gets 0! 2 people of our group got sick.   Came here with a group of 6 everyone ordered food. Everyone was disappointed.   The Golden wings are no longer good. Not crispy like before. The chicken fingers weren't good. The fries were dropping oil, it was gross. The Primo Focaccia must have had a bad part of the steak bc more than half of it was rough and chewy like it had not been trimmed correct. The Monaco Focaccia was good. The burger was small, the beef had no flavor & they had forgot to put the cheese.   To top off all the bad food they are a bit pricey. Too much for what there serving.   I won't be returning.

Been here multiple times now and every visit has been fantastic! Chicken chipotle pasta is my top favorite but everything I have tried has been great. For the menu being organic the prices are very reasonable. The service is very attentive and friendly as well.   I recommend giving this place a try. It won't disappoint.

Nice staff. Was greeted and seated right away. Appetizers were awesome..I had the meatballs. I recommend everyone try these! The pizza didn't take too long to come out and it was good also. The prices were fair, the place was kind of dark, could use more lighting. They say us in the back.. I don't recommend to sit there, it's hot from the pizza oven. I will be a returning customer.

I blame my fellow Yelpers for this one.   After reading all the great reviews on ZK Grill I knew I had to try it out. Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and there was only 1 other couple ordering food to go. I didn't blame them the place was a hole in the wall I took my food to go also.   Service:  I hope the lady at the counter was having a bad day and that was not her personality bc she didn't have any.  Food: I ordered the shawarma sandwhich & the kabob + beef combo. The chicken tastes like rubber and lacked all flavor. The beef was chewy, not tender  and I didn't taste much flavor. The kabob was alright, needed some seasoning added to it to make it good but the was it was served it wasn't. The fries... they were so white the blended in with the styraphome, tasted like card board and had NO salt on them. Fries should be golden and crispy and salted. That's a French fry.   I do NOT recommend this place!

Came in with a group of 4 and the wait was about 25 mins. People leaving looked so satisfied so we decided to wait it out. Got seated and a waitress came to the table right away. Very nice and friendly. Placed our orders and only about 10 minutes later everything was out. All 4 of us were beyond satisfied. Food was amazing, the fresh juices were amazing & and service was great. Definitely my new breakfast spot!

$16 wash plus a $5 tip. I get home and the car has dried water streaks running down front back and side & no armoral on the tires. Should of went to Francis & Sons or Cobblestone for a REAL wash!!!

Wanted to grab a sandwich late night. Hours posted say open till 10:00 pm. Got there at 9:46pm and the drive thru was blocked. Walked inside and there's an older gentlemen at the register, I ask if I can order and he just shakes his head and says "naa were closed". Thanks for nothing.

Had lunch here today after reading this place on "Yelps top 100". They were rated #30 on the list and after eating here I see exactly why! So much flavor in the food. I had a chicken philly pita and would recommend it to anyone! The owner suggested a coney dog and I had one too. First time trying a coney but it won't be my last.  The food didn't take long and the price was just right. I would recommend everyone to give this place a try! Two thumbs up!!

Stopped by today to get fingerprint cards for a state application. The lady at the front was extremely friendly and very informed on the process and exactly what I needed. She was super sweet and friendly.   I definitely recommend this place!

I was in the area and heard this place was great so I stopped by and had lunch. Got here around 12:30 and they were busy. A great sign to know your gonna get served fresh food. And Fresh Food it was! I had the Picado Pita, the meat was juicy and fresh, perfect amount of spice to the pita. The fries were great, not dropping oil like other places.    The service was very friendly and the food was pretty quick. I recommend this place to everyone. A must try especially if your near by!

Pictures on the window caught my eye as I was passing by had to try it out. Such a welcoming atmosphere! They had a "wiki-pita" to explain what the food was..really neat! I had the hummus bowl with chicken... Love how I got to create it myself and see all the toppings in front of me. Food tastes DELICIOUS! Got a smoothie from the juice bar before I left and loved that also! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!

I have been eating here for months now and feel the same way today as I felt when they first opened... I STILL LOVE IT!   Food: I've read a complaint about the bowl size change, have to DISAGREE. The amount of food today is the same as before, just changed the bowl type and I actually like the new ones more. And UNLIKE chipotle you can add anything that can fit onto your bowl without the up charge, at chipotle there's a fee for the extras and a bowl ends up costing $10-$11! Food tastes fresh and the flavor is on point!   Service: the staff here gets a 5 star rating from me. Very kind and friendly, and no matter how long th line is they always seem to maintain a quick flow and get you your food fast.   Environment:  really nice, modern & cozy feel. Good music playing. And really clean.   I highly recommend giving this place a try.

Already being a regular customer at the location on Scottsdale and Pinnacle Peak I was excited to hear they were opening another location on Scottsdale and FLW which is a little closer to my house. I came the first week they opened and tried it out... Food tasted just as amazing as the original location. I had ordered the gyro. My food came out in a timely fashion and the pita bread was LOADED with meat!   The place is very clean, bathrooms too! The staff is very friendly, I give them a A+ on customer service! One thing I love about this place is that every time I come eat at either location the taste of the food is always the same.   I recommend everyone give this place a try. You will NOT be disappointed.

I work across the street and have been waiting for a good place to eat nearby and finally I have what I wanted. Pollo Picante is not just good it's Great! Before you even walk in the door you begin to smell the amazing chicken on the grill. The menu is simple, bbq grilled chicken and a few different sides. They serve some of the best chicken I have ever had. The owner has a passion about what he does and his recipe is great!   The place is extremely clean. The staff is very nice and friendly. The prices are a great value. I'm a loyal customer already. Everyone should try this place!
