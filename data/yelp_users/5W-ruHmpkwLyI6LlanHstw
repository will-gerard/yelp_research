I originally moved into Courtney Village Apartments back in September 2010. Despite the sketchy surrounding neighborhood and higher priced rent, it was a nice centralized location that fit my lifestyle at the time.   I will say that the benefit of location is a huge plus for Courtney Village. You are less than 10 minutes from ASU and oldtown Scottsdale. Less than 30 minutes from almost every part of the valley.   Another benefit is their dog park. A good core group of residents frequent the dog park multiple times a week. They are very friendly and welcoming to new people and all they ask is that your dog not be a total dick. It gives the complex a greater sense of community.  Unfortunately, those are the only two benefits that Courtney Village offers. The apartment office is rude and unresponsive to resident inquiries. They advertise a "gated" community, but will let the gates sit broken and open for weeks at a time, giving anyone the ability to enter the complex. They promise a 48-hour maintenance work order fix, but refuse to co-ordinate their maintenance appointments with the resident's schedule. They expect you to let their maintenance guys have carte blanche access to your home without ever meeting them. They are so committed to this 48 hour time frame that if you try to call a work order in with a desired fix date more than 48 hours out, they will tell you that you need to call back closer to the desired date.   Another issue with the office is that everyone is in "cover your ass" mode. Employees are quick to throw others under the bus for misinformation and also will lie to a resident at the drop of a hat. My last rent check took over four weeks to be cashed by the office. I called after two weeks to make sure my payment was applied. The office assured me that they had cashed the check and that it must be a problem with my bank. Sure enough, once my check was cashed and I looked at the deposit date, it was deposited on the 27th of the month. Maybe instead of lying to a resident, they could just admit that they fucked up instead of leading someone on a wild goose chase with their bank over outstanding checks.  The biggest problem is that Courtney Village believes they have some sort of inflated value based on their apartment's location. They will try to charge you almost $900 a month for a 2 bedroom, 1,050sq ft apartment. They do this despite having a trailer park a block to the west, being 1/4th of a mile away from a complex where two men broke into the apartment of a woman and proceeded to rape and rob her, and also 1/4th of a mile away from a National Guard base where a solider was stabbed while taking out the trash. They refuse to even hire a security guard to do nightly checks, instead relying on the two residents who are Phoenix police members to demonstrate a level of security in the complex that does not exist. Seems like the more the neighborhood goes downhill, the higher they raise their rates. They also won't give any current residents a fair shake when it comes to renewing their lease. My buddy continued to pay nearly $800 a month for the same model unit that they rented to his neighbors for $750 two weeks earlier. Seems that they would rather risk bringing in new tenants at a slightly higher price point than working with current residents.   This review may seem negative, and in all honesty it is, but this complex is ran by a very negative group of people. They try to work you with their community bullshit, but at the end of the day they could care less if your car is broken into or if the grounds look nice or if your apartment is taken care of. They only care about that rent check being dropped in their mail on the 1st. Avoid the bullshit and find a nicer, safer, cleaner place closer to Scottsdale or ASU for the same price point.

Sometimes I think my love for Mongolian BBQ is TOO much. I could eat at places like Genghis Grill or YC's multiple times a week and never get sick of it. Hell, I won't go to chinese buffets if they don't offer Mongolian BBQ. It has to be one of my favorite foods. That is why when I moved to North Phoenix, it was a hard adjustment with there being none of the marquee Mongolian BBQ chains being up here. Then I found Stir Fry Paradise via Yelp.  My girlfriend and I went to Stir Fry Paradise on a Saturday after lunch hour. When we went in the manager(or owner, not sure) greeted us and made sure we had been to a Mongolian BBQ place before so we would know what to do. While we were selecting our food, she even made sure to help us with a sauce selection and let us know what combos work best. After that, she ended up cooking our food as well. She was really outgoing and helpful.  The food selection was pretty standard for a Mongolian BBQ place. Chicken, pork, beef, and turkey. You could pay extra for shrimp. They had a decent variety of veggies, but all I ever go for is pineapple. They offer three kinds of noodles for your meal and nine sauce varieties. In addition to the stir fry choices, they have a small sidebar of regular chinese buffet items. Normally when a place like this has this side offer, they are pretty bad and not edible. At Stir Fry Paradise, this is the opposite. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed a few items from the side bar.   Overall, I would say check our Stir Fry Paradise if you're in the neighborhood and want some Mongolian BBQ. Good prices and great service make this a great local eatery.

After moving to North Phoenix last week, I was looking for a new place to take my corgi since he loves the dog park. I found Foothills Park on google maps and decided to try it out. I was pleasently surprised by this dog park. It has two seperate parks connected by the entrance area. One is a big open area and has some obstacle courses. The second is a smaller grassy area for small dogs.  When we arrived, I was surprised by the amount of big dogs there. There were at least eight big dogs playing and having fun. When I brought my dog in, they all came up and checked him out, but none of them were aggressive or bullies to him. The owners were friendly and my dog seemed to enjoy the place. The obstacle course is simple, great for a newbie dog.   As we were there, at least twelve more dogs showed up. Since half of them were smaller dogs, people began migrating to the small dog area. The small dog area is nice for the dogs that get nervous around the bigger pups, but it seems to be lacking. The obstacle course is definitely designed for smaller to medium sized dogs, yet there are no obstacles on the small dog side. Other than that, its a nice break for the small pups.  Foothills Park is a great place for anyone in the NW valley looking for a place to take their dog. People are friendly and clean up after their dogs, the dogs are nice and friendly, and its in a beautiful area. I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area.

I found Jim's Auto after finding his shop on Yelp. I read the bio and decided I would rather deal with a mechanic doing his own thing than one of the local chains that would just try to up-sell me additional unneeded repairs. I called and made an appointment with Jim for a diagnostic because my truck has been making some weird noises. As luck would have it, on my way over to his shop my clutch went into it's last dying moments. Jim diagnosed the problem immediately, walked me through a couple of other problems, and had a quote to me in about 30 minutes. He was able to get the work done on a Saturday, which is amazing in itself. Within 24 hours he had my trucking running as good as new. He diagnosed some additional things I should be aware of on my truck, but was honest with me on urgency and the time frame of when they would need to be fixed. He never pushed me to instantly schedule a follow up appointment and gave me honest mechanical advice. He provides the type of service you would expect from a one man show and you can trust him to fix your vehicle. I would recommend Jim to anyone in the North Valley who is looking for a trust worthy, reliable mechanic.

When my friend first told me about crossfit, I was intrigued. He had sold me on the idea, even after seeing it be the butt of many jokes online for years. I tried a couple of local area Crossfit gyms and while the workout routines intrigued me, none of them ever seemed to click. When I found Crossfit Uprising, it was basically my last shot at trying crossfit before deciding it just wasn't for me. Luckily, CU was the difference I was looking for.  Jared, the owner, was very welcoming and helpful when I did my intro week. He helped scale workouts to my level of fitness and was very quick to correct my technique when it needed it. Everyone at the gym was very welcoming and were quick to provide encouragement during work outs. Crossfit Uprising has been a great environment for me for the last eight months and I *almost* look forward to working out now.

Great service provided by this company. Found them via their Groupon. Took three years of pet and toddler stains on my carpets and made them look brand new again. Would highly recommend
