I have been an Old Chicago fan since the late 80s. The decor is nice, the selection of beer is always good and the food is great.   Oh, and the service is always excellent.

Very disappointed in this place. I used to really like eating here but not any longer.  You need to get your old chef back.

The food is decent. The service pretty much sucks.   The whole time I was ordering two sandwiches the server acted as if she was impatient and was going out of her way to build my order. She could have at least tried to show some level of interest.

Very friendly and helpful service.  I dropped my iPhone and fractured my glass front cover. Trying to read through the cracks was like looking at a Picasso.   Got an up front quote and time to fix estimate.  They made the phone look brand new again.    Thanks

So after driving by this place since they opened repeatedly we finally had a chance to stop by the new place today and wanted to explore the menu while watching some football.  We ordered an appetizer, sandwiches and a desert.  We left with a nicely filled "to-go" container and were very satisfied.  FYI, the servings are quite large.  They set up the building to have the general dinning on the outer edge of the restaurant and the bar is in the center.  What is unique and something that I like is that the bar area is separated from the general dinning room by walls with windows and a set of doors which is nice if you are looking for a quiet dinning experience and are not wanting to listen to the bar activity going on 5 to 10 feet away.  There is also a private dinning area in the back.  We did not get a look at that though.  The d√©cor is a darker wood, walls and trim but there are a lot of windows and plenty of lighting so that you can read the menu without having any problems.  My night vision isn't what is used to be so that that means there is plenty of light.  lol Since we were looking to watch the football games we just headed for the bar.  The dinning area looked nice and clean.  It seemed like the bar had all the various games on so they must have the NFL package.  If you sit at one of the lower tables you can control the TV at your station and pick whichever station/game you like.  So that is pretty nice.  So for the food.... We ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms for the appetizer.  They showed up and we were surprised by the size.  They were each about 3 to 4" across and freshly cooked. The shrooms were great and the accompanying sauce was good too. For the main part of the meal, the wife had a Rueben and I had the Corned Beef sandwich.  One had the steak fries and one had the onion rings.  The pastrami was very lean and excellent.  The corned beef was very good as well.  I'm looking forward to going again for the dinner version of the corned beef. For desert, we opted for the bread pudding.  Again it was very good.  The sauce that it came with was the highlight.  Very good but not overly strong the way some will come.  I really enjoy bread pudding and normally jump at the chance to try a new version.  I would rank this up as one of the top puddings on my list.  You definitely need to try this. The service was great.  The waiters were well versed in the food that they offer and explained the prep and contents very well.  That is so nice to have when you are new to a restaurant.  They stopped by frequently and we never had to worry about glasses being empty.  Note: I generally rely on yelp reviews when I'm going to a new place to eat and I was a little worried after reading the review from Oct 21st but after my experience and seeing that this "person" has only completed 1 review in their lifetime on yelp I am guessing that it is a fake account and they probably work or own a nearby competitor.  Take that for what it is.  I will be back.  Especially on Sundays!
