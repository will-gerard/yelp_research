Dr. Majahad and the rest of the group is great. I was seen very quickly for emergency dental services. The customer service here is top notch and something I have never experienced anywhere else. I completely trust them as I found this group 3 or 4 years ago for a second opinion and never left since. They always take their time with me and get me in as soon as possible. I also had trouble removing a temporary flipper and she took time in her busy day to show me the proper technique and adjust it for me. I can tell everyone in the office really care about their patients, unlike other offices that only want the money. It looks like I will be staying with Southwest dental in Chandler for a very long time.

Unfortunately, I have not had much of a great experience with this doctor. I came in to get my labs completed as a requirement for graduate school. At the appointment, I brought in the paper that listed the labs to be completed. When the results came back a few labs that were required on the documentation were missing. I understand that these things do happen, so I returned to the office to see about doing another test to obtain these values. When I met with the doctor he asked me why I did not mention this before and to not assume that these labs should be completed, even though the documentation provided initially asked for these values. I was dismissed with him telling me "I was wasting his time" as he wrote an order for me to complete the labs elsewhere. I do understand that these mistakes do happen, but did not expect the doctor to tell me I was wasting his time as I did not come to blame him for his mistakes, but was met with defensiveness anyway. Other times he has been kind and has was helpful with answers, so I was not expecting this on my return visit.

Best indian food in Phoenix, hands down. Get the sag lamb and beef or chicken korma. The waiter always remembers us and offered is free samosas. Great customer service!
