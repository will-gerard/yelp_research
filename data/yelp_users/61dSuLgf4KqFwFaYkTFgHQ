I decided to catch a movie down at Tempe Marketplace the other day with a friend (Horrible Bosses, AWESOME) and decided to head upstairs to Cadillac for some pre- movie happy hour. Being that I sit at bars except for family dinners we ponied up. I saw that they had a couple of 4 Peaks beers on draft so I chose to go the peach ale route while my buddy grabbed a frozen margarita. Both were super refreshing, enough so that I eventually had 2 more! Got down on the preztels appetizer, which when dipped in the fondue tasted like little angels dancing on my tongue before I ate them! My buddy ordered the bacon wontons, which I had to steal one, and they were one of the best things with bacon I have ever tried (right up there with Citizen's bacon popcorn and Beckett's Tables' bacon smores!) So flavorful it made me want 20 of them! I was also really stoked to see Blackmaker on the back bar. For those of you who don't know, try it. It's like Jager without the anise flavor or harshness.  Now for the part that pushed me to write this: I noticed quite a few people comment on the service being bad, but I thought the bartenders did a great job staying on top of us. There was a male by the name of Justin who was very helpful in recommendations, and he was with a girl (Deanna?) Who was extremely personable and outgoing. They made sure my beers were always filled and our food was great! I will for sure make this my movie theater pre-game locale!

One of my favorite places in town. Bar none. The bar is one of the better ones in town..... fresh herbs getting pulled as you walk in.... and a potato pizza with an egg? (Chef's recommendation, ungodly rad) was the best advice I got in years on a dish! If you haven't been there, save yourself the headache and just go! Also, if you can catch Kris Korf behind the bar on a weekday, get ready for a drink that rivals unicorn blood in greatness!

This was already my favorite spot in Old Town, but now that Jason Asher is there it should be 7 stars! The atmosphere is amazing, the drinks were at first good but now amazing, and the crowd is perfect. You get a few wannabe hipsters on the weekend, but its better than the Ed Hardy crowd! Casey, Kiki, Neil.... all amazing! Sundays here are the grown up from Metalhead crowd.... it's awesome! I should add that the Sunday promo puts out cocktails that rival anywhere in America, wether it's The Alembic in San Fran, or Death and Co. in NYC.....

The burger was fantastic and the sweet potato overload fries as well as the truffle fries were a glutton's dream..... but the sevice was decent at best. I think the girl might have been new though so I'll cut them some slack! Reasonably priced, good tasting food will win me over almost anytime.

If I wasn't dragged here on an assignment, you can more than believe I wouldn't be seen within a mile of the place..... literally. I loved the girl in pajamas who tried hitting on us. I also loved the mean mugging Indian chick who called me a pretty boy because I was wearing a button up shirt. Her missing teeth were real attractive. The drinks were sugar heavy visions of diabetes in the future, I think my legs went numb before I left! Sadly, if you could take everything that stereotypes Mesa into one room and add a dash of homelessness, this was it. I will scratch my eyes out before I ever go there again!
