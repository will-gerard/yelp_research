Not a fan of Apple but will say that this store is better than the one at Scottsdale Quarter.   Less Apple peeps at this one just standing there looking cool doing nothing! The guys/gals I have used for training have been decent, not amazing but have tried to be helpful.

like everyone says, this place is a hidden gem in oldtown!  Reminds me of restaurants in Italy. once you are inside, you will litterally think you could be there!  The pizzas are delic and quite large. Have had several types and all have been delicious.  In addition, they will do half and half if you cant make up your mind on the ingredients (how awesome is that??!!)   We always order their caesaer. Its one of the best we have had anywhere in the world. None fo their other salads can compare  Go for the atmosphere, good priced meal and delicious pizzas/salad!

Love this place!  Terroir has a classy elegance with a down-home down-to-earth vibe. They often have live music or dj (sophisticated music, not loud) which adds to spice to the place.  Service is efficient and friendly. Like another reviewer stated, the servers/bartenders will remember you and talk to you as much or as little as you'd like. They make you feel at home and comfortable. The other patrons at the bar are oftena also friendly and will join in chit-chat if you want to make friends.  Their HH wines are always $7 and huge pours! LOVE THEM! In addition I have eaten some of their food. Its pretty tasty and flavorful, just wish they had more salads and healthy choices to choose from  The biggest downside of this place is that it is not located closer to my house in Oldtown. If it was, I would own a stool and never leave. :)

Why do I forget that you exist??  Delicious, fresh food and great atmosphere to work or meet people for coffee/lunch.  I tend to order the same thing every time because its SOOO good but today I finally ventured out and had the chicken pom salad.  Just like the other meals that I have had here, it was yum!   Two suggestions to get people like me to visit more  1)  prices are kinda expensive. I know its quality and youre a local biz but I would love to have some lower priced options so I can spend $10max for lunch.  Or 2)   Give us a frequent visitor card to encourage us to visit more frequently and aappreciate the value. Paradise Bakery which is direct competition but not as tasty (and coffee is way worse at PB) has a fantastic program which gets me (and other friends, biz owners) to visit.   Id also give a 5 star review if you addes a program such as (buy 10 coffees, get 1 free or buy 8 lunches, get one free).

This is becoming one of my fav hh's! The prices are great due to their "Every night is all night half off at the bar".  Even more important is their quality of food and drink and friendly bar service.  Ive tried several bar apps and have been impressed with each of them.  Stuffed portobellos, roasted veggies, hummus and chicken schwarma are all items I would eat again and again.  I like that they are relatively healthy apps but also have tons of flavors and spices.  The portions are perfect too! Not too large or small.   The cocktails for $5 are also huge value! The extremely friendly bartenders will even alter them if you prefer less sugar or a diff juice.  Lots of interesting locals come here.  And all have been friendly and willing to share their favorite menu items.  The only downside is that the bar can be packed so its hard to score a seat. Also, sometimes the bartenders too busy to give the extra TLC I sometimes want. Id love it if they couldexpand the seating so more of us could become groupies. :)

just bought a pair of hiking shoes there today. Good customer service, patient when I wanted to try a bunch of different kinds on.  Prices not cheap but also their quality of shoes better than a typical shoe store that selling hiking shoes. Wish they had more selection than they do but other than that, it is a good place to buy high quality sports shoes

The gals who teach are so awesome! They are sweet, knowledgeable and down to earth!!   I also like the clientele since they are serious about working out, nice, quiet yet friendly. Even though this is in a busy, hot Downtown Scottsdale location, the attitude there is anything but snobbish.     The program gives your body an all over workout which is not too rigorous for me so that I do NOT hate going.  :)    This is the first for me!  'Ive been to tons of other pilates, orange theory/cross fit type, strength training/bootcamp type classes and find that they aren't as fun for me since I am getting older (40+). Karve barre classes gives me the toning I need (my legs, shoulders, abs always burn during every class) but they use gentle movements and nice music so I actually feel RELAXED, graceful and fit afterwards.  Love this place and have brought several guests (mostly older gals) and everyone of them has loved this place because their muscles were sore afterwards and felt rejuvenatied

Sooooo yummy!! I love the red velvet!  Both the cake and the frosting.  And how cool that they come in mini sizes so I dont have to feel so guilty when I eat them. The owner is fantastic too. She really is a happy, giving person which makes the cakes even taste better.   Definitely, visit this Scottsdale or Arcadia location since she owns both.

Love John, the Manager. Always there with a smile and great at customer service. This Fashion Square Starbucks is a VERY busy locations with lots of visitors but these guys are efficient and friendly despite it.  Wish they had some inside seating and comfy chairs for the hot and cold months.  But enjoy the spacious outdoor seating which is unique for starbucks when there are NO SMOKERS and weather is good.

Love this joint!!!  Only wish it was closer to oldtown so i could visit daily!    The americanos are strong and cheap!  3 bux for 3 shots- pretty great!  The place is comfy with lots of relaxing chairs and tables.    Yes, its not the most modern place but when I want to relax and hang out with my americano, this is the type of place I want. It feels hippy/local which is perfect for when you arent in a rush. I dont find it dirty, they have a non-Starbucks vibe which makes it "cool".  (Btw, I also like Starbucks but it just has a different kind of atmosphere.)  Yes the workers are chattty with each other but I find them very friendly and down-to-earth. They move quick enough for me but I do want to admit that am not in a hurry when i go there.  I think this is a great place and appreciate that they arent a chain and support the community so much!  Please help keep them in business :)

Had a great 60 min massage here for $35 today   Misty was friendly, sweet and great masseuse for being so tiny!  Ive had plenty of massages in my lifetime but the way she massaged my arms and hands was the best!  Who ever thought that a hand/arm massage was so amazing?  She spent alot of time on my back per my request-.. was a great listener.   The shop is contemporary and clean- much to my surprise since the price was so low.  The one downside of this place is that  you can hear the shop music and workers while you are getting a massge.  Wish it was more peaceful but for $35, beggars cant be choosers!

The garlic aoli wth bread is to die for! Have taken several people here and besides the gorgeous atmosphere of the place, they also comment on the aoli.  Have tried many of the tapas and paella and all pretty good. Fav is sitting at the bar, choosing a delic wine from an extensive wine list (or sangria which my hub loves) and eating their breadcwith aoli.  Gotta try it!

AMAZING Place for HH!! Our fav spot for the value due to the beautiful atmosphere, great pricing and tasty apps.  They change their deals every month. We have had $1 sangrias, $2 apps and wine, 1/2 off entire bill: these are just some of the deals they have run  GARLIC AIOLI!!!  I repeat again-  it is to DIE FOR!  Every person I have taken here (a dozen or so) raves about their fresh bread and aioli.   I dream of that aioli every night. :)

Friendly service feels like  a wholesome family run place.  I love their cheese bread.   Great value for melted cheese on pizza bread.  Roomy and like "serve yourself" fountain drinks. Low key place perfect for casual night.  order at counter and they bring out to us.

Gorgeous restaurant! They spared no expense when designing it. Love the open air windows, firepit, bar area  Definitely this is a place to dress up and people watch the "older" Scts hipsters.  Atmosphere is one of the best in Scottsdale  HOWEVER...  Sadly  My tanzy salad was not so hot.  the lettuce was wilted and the other veggies were definitely old. I ended up getting a bad stomach for several days afterward.  I ordered chicken for the salad which was tasty and a good sized portion. My friends said they liked their food but I didnt hear "delicious" ever come out of their mouths.  One had scallops and the other had the roasted chicken.  If i were to return, i would order the scallops because not only did the plate look gorgeous, the mushrooms and sauce looked wonderful.  THe prices seemed high for the quality of the food.  The service was friendly and especially attentive with the water. The bread was warm and good too.  Id go back for drinks and light apps but not for dinner

For the first time, hub and I ate there last night, NYE.   I had the scallops and hubby had the pork.  Both were delicious entrees and we liked being able to order our own sides. He thought the mac&cheese was delicious and I enjoyed the broccilini. I started with the grilled artichoke which was pretty good (Ive had better at many orher restaurants) but husband loved their meetballs. Meetballs were sweet and flavired wirh cumun and large portion.  The portions were generally not big (but enough to fill you up) and the prices were reasonable for Quality.   The service was great! Our waiter was friendly, extremely attentive and knowledgeable.  We were also impressed by the mgr who thanked us sincerely with a handshake and introduction as we walked out.  The singer was also impressive in his rendition on modern music.   We dine out frequently and I would highly recommend this restaurant. Not only because of the food quality but also for the relaxing and hip ambience.  Please visit so we can keep them in business. Its a keeper!!!

One of the best massages I have had. Ive gone to manu 5 star resorts yet I still think Seth's massage is just as good as many of them -- yet at a fraction of the cost.  Beware however that this is not a 5 star spa experience! Its a small office with tiny massage rooms and VERY thin walls so you can hear people talking, which is annoying.  The thin walls are a big downside to this place. However, Seth seems to understands these limitations so is willing to give discounts and great deals for his massages which makes me ignore the thin walls  If you like deep tissue,  and are willing to deal with a non-chain small biz massage office, dont want to pay alot for a massage. Btw, Seth is a biz owner and a great masseuse so he books fast and it will take a day or two to call you back. Be patient though!  I highly recommend Seth for a great deep tissue massage!!

Healthy and inexpensive food in the Waterfront - YEAH!!  THe people that work here are extremely friendly, helpful and customer service friendly too.  They keep it clean and accomodate picky, higher maintenance people like myself  The food is much better quality than the places surrounding it so not sure why its not busier.    I love the Greek salad with chicken. The chicken, the potato salad, grilled veggies, dressing... yum, I salivate just thinking of their salad. And now, they upgraded their pitas to the soft ones.  HEAVEN!!  ITs a toss up between them and Pita Jungle for best greek salad.  Depends on the day so please check them out  My hubby loves the kabob and unlimited refills on drinks. Also, they substitute a nice size side salad in case you dont want the beans or rice.  This is a place that you need to try!  If shopping at fashion square, its worth the small walk to leave the food court and eat at Zoe's

Excellent job! My insurance adjuster hooked me up with these guys otherwise I would have not gone to them. I live in Scottsdale and this shop is in Chandler.  Owner was so service oriented that he drove to my house with an employee and picked up my car the day my insurance approved the claim. They had my car for almost 2 weeks because of all the damage from my crash.  Owner regularly called me with updates without my asking.   The car was beautiful when I picked it up!  They even did some extra detailing on it which was a nice surprise for me.  The shop was spotless and very pretty.   Not that what the office looks like matters to the quality of their work but it does reveal their attention to detail and their care about treating their customers.   I would highly recommend these guys if you need autobody work done.  By the way, my car is an upscale brand so that should make you feel more  comfortable if you are concerned about high  qualify workmanship.

Fun joint!   Its a hole in the wall with a fashionable twist.  The people who camer here the night I was there were hipsters who were more into caual and convo than a club or a dark sports bar.  People were pretty friendly (wish there had been more chill couches to hang ou t in) and loved the skee ball!!  Spent at least an hour playing- so cool to have it at the bar.

Spacious place which is very accomodating to people working alone or in the group.  I feel comfortable coming alone and just reading paper.  Love the Choose 2. Such great deal and choices.  Plus, you can even customize what they have on the menu.  I am always trying to watch my weight so it is awesome that I can fill up on a turkey sandwich and greek salad for such little calories, high protein and low cost. Plus, its way better tasting than fast food!!   What is not there to love!!  Thank you for taking over the old Fuddruckers. You are becoming my 2nd home. :)

One of my fav Starbucks! Cant beat the location-- looking at Squaw Peak mountains is awesome.   Lots of seating and nice set up inside store.  Friendly customer service from all staff. I drink tons of coffee -many of them  free refills because of my gold card status and they never make me feel guilty or bad.     I highly recommend checking out this location when you want good coffee in a pretty atmosphere.

Good place with healthy, fairly flavorful mexican fastfood and good prices. Similar to chipotle- but a tad lower end. Hub likes their beans and rice but still prefers the pork at chipotle a bit more.   I prefer this place to Chipotle so not sure why everyone says different?? The veggies have more flavor plus they have way better options than chipotle. Plus their chips are better too.     . I usually hate queso but qdoba's has peppers and great spices: its addicting! also love their salty chips. The 2 kinds of extra grilled veggies are great add in but get annoyed that they charge extra even if i skip the rice, cheese.. And then they are even skimpy with their veggie portion.  Hot red salsa is really good but dont care for the others. Service is friendly but not consistent when it comes to charging items or knowing whats a "naked burrito, salad...".     Love their frequent buyer program but the customer service from corporate is awful.  Reached out to them twice to get credit for meal when I have forgotten my card (why they cant look up my account with my email or phone number is crazy) but never get replies from their corporate office.

Wow, the reviews were right. Loved this place!   Live in Oldtown Scottsdale so have tons of restaurants nearby - and many of them wonderful. Franco's was a place that I always wanted to go to but have never been able to get a reservation when I've called last minute. (Yes, I tend to procrastinate!!)  Thankfully, I finally got in! My hubby and I were definitely impressed and will absolutely return!  Franco was so kind and welcoming - no fakeness. We could see that he loves his business, his staff and patrons. Thought our italian waiter was exceptional too!  Great service (gave us space but would check on us at the right time), was knowledgeable  but non assuming (unlike many italian and french waiters Ive met at other restaurants at this caliber).   The food was delicious!!!  Loved that they started out out with bread and antipasti (these freebies have gone away from many restaurants which is sad since they really help start the night!).     Husband ordered pasta and refused to share since it was so good. Im always trying to eat low carb and healthy so ordered the chicken and shockingly - this was so flavorful and delicious - for chicken!!!  Because of the reviews, I started with the caprese and like the reviews said- it was also delicious. And they were kind to split it up for us even though we never asked for this.  A definite gem in Scottsdale and better than all the other italian restaurants within 10 miles.

Great workout. Hate going to class but man, do I feel great afterwards. This is the best and most efficient workout for 60 minutes.  They make sure you get at least 50-55 minutes of a QUALITY hard core regime but its cool that you can go to your own pace and not feel stupid. Half cardio and half strength training. Like the trainers and the front desk staff too.

Service is always friendly and quick.  Good food for what this is since I tend to avoid fattening food places like this. Like that they have some healthy options for me; while hubby can get his high calorie sandwiches and fries (Which he thought were some of the best in town).  Its loud with tons of tv's but thats the way its supposed to be since this is a sports bar/burger place.  We are not into sports so its not so great for us but we will still come back because of the great value, fun location and atmosphere and variety of food options!

Service awful.  Attitude when I ordered.  Didn't get my food order right and got even. more attitude.  No wifi, out of coffee- maybe it was just a bad luck day?? Regardless, I thought the food (salad and sandwiches) were overpriced. I could see why they were selling groupons! Now for the positive- Delic Americano!! Strong and tasty and several parking spots right at front door for this place which was convenient

Great value! So glad I decided to test them out.  Healthy, flavorful and totally affordable!  Hop this new place does well since I love the idea of eating freshly grilled fish for lunch.  Girl at front (manager, I believe!)is also sweet and uses customer names. Place is spotless and great seating avail too

Where have you been all of my life??? I Healthy, tasty food at good prices that lists calories, protein AND friendly, fast service???  I'm so excited to have discovered this gem!!!!  I eat salads daily, and love knowing nutritional info so this will become my "go to" place.  Very cool that they have choices (even a dozen plus dressing options) or you can build your own. I can't wait to try all of these. Such great combos and options.  Lots of seating and clean.  Can sit in the beautiful front courtyard or plenty of space inside.   Thank you for joining Scottsdale Chamber so I could learn about you.  You are somewhat hidden so I would have missed out.  :(   P.s Only thing I would change is to add wifi and a frequent eater card or something like that.
