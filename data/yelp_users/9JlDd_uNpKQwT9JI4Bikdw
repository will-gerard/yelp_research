Had the best first experience here. I decided to try Zoe's Kitchen out for my first time and ordered the Chicken Pita Pizza. I informed the cashier that I had never been here and she certainly was friendly and welcoming. In fact, the entire staff were just was warm. My pita pizza was pretty darn good, and upon giving me my to-go order I was handed a complementary cookie for the wait. Which that too was absolutely delicious. They are good people over at this location. I will be returning next time I am back on this end of town!

My appointment was scheduled for 10:15am. Good thing I have the day off with NO PLANS because it's 11:50 and I am STILL sitting in the lobby amongst 4 other clients. I don't understand the reasoning for an appointment if it clearly does not matter who gets in here first. Not to mention they don't explain over the phone that this wait time is usually expected...appointment or not. The staff is friendly, yes, but communication & efficiency lacks. My total visit was 3 hours and 90% of it was in the lobby.

My boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and come to this location quite frequently to eat and have some drinks at the bar. We have always had good, friendly service.  The 2 for $25 is our favorite! Also I recommend their Pinot Grigio if you are a wine drinker :)

I come here to make copies for work pretty frequently, and I have to say it's always been a good experience with the staff. They are friendly and accommodating as best they can with special requests, and no complaints on the pricing either.

I had a recall notice for my '05 TSX and even though it's of nothing major I decided to bring it in anyway for the experience.  They did a basic service check as well and printed out an estimate with all the problems my car has. I didn't feel pressured into bringing it back specifically to them and ASAP . Abel was of great, kind and courteous help considering everything I brought it in for was free.   The waiting area was comfortable and I enjoyed the complementary snacks, drinks and coffee!

I have been taking my car here for quite some time now for oil changes, and I have always been satisfied with the service. The guys who work here are always polite &friendly and they don't PUSH you to get other things fixed on your car, they simply inform you of a few things (if any) and give you an estimate should you decide to go through them. The price (for oil changes) aren't too expensive either. I am very satisfied with their service.

I love the customer service here - Randie was very helpful & genuinely friendly with taking my order and also giving me info on the Starbucks Rewards program. She is also very good at remembering customers names while they are still here if they head back up for a refill, or in my case a breakfast sandwich! They really make you feel like a valued customer :)

I hated BBQ my entire life (its un-american, I know). Seriously though. Couldn't stand the taste of burnt ketchup. My Birthday had come around and my genius boyfriend of 3 years opts to take me out to Famous Daves (and I thought he would be wasting his time and money).   I gave the BBQ pork "1 last go" before I gave up on BBQ forever, and unbinoxed to me I LOVED IT!!   Now I'm "BBQ addicted". We have gone at least 5x the last couple of months.   They're so darn good I changed my life-long mind. How bout that? p:

Delicious sandwiches. Staff here are great, they are very friendly and make rounds to make sure your food is good. If not, they offer to remake it or get you something else instead. Southwest Club is my favorite, and they do have fresh baked treats such as cookies and brownies.

Good place to come eat and chat or hangout with friends - since I am a local and come often with my room mates, we are always running into friends and making new ones. Great atmosphere. Upbeat and friendly!

FANTASTIC work AND customer service. I have never been happier with an auto company, especially a repair shop. Everyone was very helpful, pretty quick, and seemed to have genuine care about you and you car/cars service. Not to mention the work they did was superb* and they went above and beyond (in my mind). They fixed some minor things that weren't "on the list" of things to fix, and I am grateful for it! Thanks so much you guys - I WILL be coming back (my car has a lot of other issues needing attention) so these guys will be who I bring it to. If I wasn't reversed into, I would have never known how affordable, quick, friendly, and efficient these guys are. Thanks again guys :)

As mentioned in my above (er...below) review, I did bring it back (this week!) Again, stellar service and everything is working fantastic. I had shocks replaced and brought in fog lights I have had hanging around for forever. Very thankful for their service and hard work :)

This place is horrible when it comes to...well everything!   LONG story: I had gotten started with the SW Dental in Chandler but I had moved to Laveen. I did not have insurance and I thought they would be more affordable for me to get my wisdom teeth out, plus already having a file with SW dental. The LAVEEN office was very unprofessional over the phone when telling me they "dont transfer files from other offices" and that I would be a new patient. (1st red flag). I asked if I should call the Chandler office and see if they would transfer per my request and the response was "yeah yeah! do that!" (again, unprofessional).  Chandler office gave me NO grief on the transfer question and said they would send it over. I call Laveen, they said they got it.   A WEEK later I went in for my visit to schedule the actual wisdom removal, and upon my arrival they told me to fill out the New Patient forms because they have not received my file from Chandler (why did both parties tell me it was sent & received??)  When being sent back for Xrays (that have already been taken by the Chandler office), the tech must have been right out of school. She was all over the place and didn't know much about working the Pano xray machine. Pushing different buttons to see which did what, she was a finger-push away from clicking the button without my xray jacket. She comes back around the corner saying "oh my gosh I always forget this, here put this on". Uh 2nd red flag! (luckily i didnt have to pay for them since they were "waiting" on my file from the other location)  Upon probing all over my mouth and reviewing the xrays with nurse, I mentioned I have high dentist anxiety and would like to have my boyfriend present for the day i have my wisdoms removal. They seemed real unsure about how to handle my request.  I go into the clinic for the dreaded surgery day and I asked if my boyfriend can come back with me just until I was out. The response was NO because there would be too many wires and the room is not big enough. I took a lot of deep breaths and went back alone with the same dumb xray nurse i had previously.   I sit in the chair and i am constantly fidgeting nervously and fighting back what i call "nervousness tears". (I'm a big baby when it comes to the dentist). The doc comes in and was not of much comfort, just wanted to get it done and over with. No small talk, just dentist talk. They messed up the 1st time with the injection and had to try a couple more times before actually getting it right. Now i'm REAL nervous and I let the tears fall. The nurse then goes "why you crying we havent even started yet". UH HELLO HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN MY ANXIETY TO YOU GUYS!!!?????  Then I was out.    Oh by the way, No i did not get a followup phone call from the doc or nurse seeing how my post-surgery was going.   And not to mention the ridiculous pricing for it all even with "their" insurance. It cost more than my boyfriends wisdom removal he had done at the Chandler office.   VERY DISPLEASED and HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!   How are they still in business!?

These guys gave me the best dealership experience I've ever had. I am in love with my new car, and aside from that they did business professionally & caring enough to do what they can to make my payments work in my budget, as well as I wanted to help them get  another car off the lot. I'm just shy of 25 and I never thought I could afford a "new" car that wasn't from Craigslist. They really went the extra mile. Even those who weren't part of the sale were beyond friendly and were very customer service oriented without the feeling of being fake and just another bonus for their pockets. Thanks to Alex & Johnny. You guys rock

Food was delicious for my first time here! The wait for seating wasn't long nor for the time to make our food. Sure the greasy burger soaked the bottom bun but that's how you know its good (p:

This place was/is a MUCH better experience than what I had with Southwest Dental Laveen.   Immediately I was greeted (both on the phone and in person) in a friendly, positive demeanor (unlike SW Dental...) and felt comfort.   I have dentist anxiety and cant help but be nervous every time no matter where.    During my 1st visit with Prime, I kept myself pretty calm more-so than I have elsewhere. They made it easier on me with their friendly & positive demeanor's. They were willing to address any issue I may have and wanted to be sure I was doing OK (taking my nervousness/anxiety into consideration!).   Sure, I still loath going to the dentist but I feel that these guys are better experienced than other offices,and know what customer satisfaction & care is all about.      I have read the previous reviews and I believe they need better credit considering a majority are 2+ years old.

The food has always been good [enough], but the service has always been so-so of the many times I've been here. The minimal required sense of friendliness & urgency to help customers for the sake of keeping their doors open I imagine. Luckily the only reason I continue to come is because I like the food and it's close to my house but I would like to see them do better in the customer service department.

Love, LOVE this place! Everyone here is very friendly. Upon my 1st time here last week every person working greeted and welcomed me. I went back the next 3 days in a row and is now a temptation every time I drive past. They are quick, friendly, positive and convenient. MUCH quicker (and tastier) than Starbucks (:  Thanks for making it a fun experience!

You know, I have been to this location a number of times. I've been treated by a majority of the doctors who have worked here and my favorites by FAR are Dr. Shakarian & Dr. Poff. The Joint in general, (i have been to quite a few clinics in Arizona) is an amazing concept. I love that I can pop into any clinic convenient to me, that I don't need an appointment, and can get a good rate for an adjustment. No x-rays, which is different, but they do a good job without. As far as pricing goes, the monthly plan is the way to go. There are other options too if you aren't into going once a week. I am not one who likes chiropractors and being touched...but I can suck it up for 5 minutes a week. My body thanks me later. I highly recommend it.

My new all time favorite lunch spot especially if you are looking for healthier options for a good price. They are in the same category as Paradise Bakery and Wildflower but in my mind much better and more cost effective for what you get. They are efficient going down the line and very have friendly Customer Service. Not to mention the desserts are amazing for those with a sweet tooth!

A very quaint, chic kind of place. Doesn't give you the typical bar-feel atmosphere. Their beer is good, I of course came to try out the local beer specifically. The bartender working is very polite and offers samples if you aren't sure yet which one you want to drink.

Food, beer, atmosphere, staff....all deserve 5 stars. I love that I can sit on the patio with my dog, and have a LOCAL beer. My first experience was great, and my server Alexis was on top of it! They do have other beers aside from their own, and also "dogs eat free" on Saturdays. My pup was able to have a doggie patty while I had my burger. An enjoyable experience!

Amir has been of great help during my search for my first home. I am still on the prowl but he has helped a couple of my family members find their homes. Along the way he has been very helpful, knowledgeable and personable. It has been a great experience thus far and I am very pleased to work with him! Highly recommend.

I am a fan of this Panera. I am occasionally sent to work at a location that is near this particular one, and I remember when it was closed for the transition between Paradise Bakery into Panera. They have always had good customer service in my eyes, and adding the 5 Kiosks to the front is very efficient when you want to skip the line. I've never had a problem with their food either.
