Horrible Horrible customer service. I also bought the living social. I called and made an appointment, however, when I showed up at my appointment they told me they had no record of an appointment under my name/phone number. They did not offer to reschedule or even apologize. Very very disappointed in this salon and I will never ever return.

Very very poor customer service. I walked in this store the first time and the employees just ignored me. Then I left because I was unsure if I wanted to make a purchase. I returned about 30 minutes later to buy a hat. As I walked in, the employee at the door ignored me and greeted the couple that walked in after(even explaining some sales to the couple). I walked to the back and got the hat I wanted and walked up to the register. I waited there for about 5 minutes before the guy at the computer looked up. He just looked at me. I asked him "where can I buy this hat?"  He just pointed to the register. I said "well maybe I shouldn't buy it here if you don't want to ring me up." So he said "ok" and turned around and walked back to the computer. Completely rude.   I did not make a purchase, nor will I ever.   Also, just a side note- there was an employee laying in the middle of the store putting together a shelving unit. Very unprofessional and weird. (Like can't you do that in the back or when there aren't a bunch of customers in the store?)

I loved the office and doctor! I would definitely recommend this office to anyone needing an eye doctor.

This is our go to place in Gilbert when we want to grab dinner. It's close by and the food is always hot and delicious! I personally like the buffalo chicken wrap and the burgers. My family frequently get the ribs and the monte cristo.  Only 4 stars because sometimes the service isn't be the best- but it's never been horrible!

I went to Thrive today expecting great things! I had tried an acai bowl in California and it was so good! I was excited to find out there was somewhere near my house that had acai bowls!  When I got to Thrive I ordered a small original bowl, which was $4.50. I then sat down at a table to wait for my order, thinking it would take 5-8minutes to get the small bowl prepared. Well, I ended up waiting 25+ minutes for my small bowl. Ridiculous. There were 4 people working there (at least that I saw) and 2 others in the place waiting for their orders. Why would it take so long to prepare a simple, small acai bowl?!? I have the feeling that the people working at Thrive care more about laughing and talking with their friends in the back (where they prepare the bowls) than actually helping the customers. The employees were not rude or mean but they were definitely not very friendly.   The bowl itself was nothing spectacular. It was just ok. There were 2 pieces of strawberries and 2 pieces of sliced banana and some granola on the top of the acai. I'm not sure it was worth $4.50. Definitely not worth the 25 minute wait. I will not be retuning to Thrive anytime soon... :(

I love living at Apache Station. It is such a fun community. I have always felt safe living here and have never had any issues with my apartment. I would recommend Apache Station to any college student or young professional!
