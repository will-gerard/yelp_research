Meh, it's a clean and modern convention center, but as is often the case, everything is a bit over-priced and lower quality.  Coffee was disgusting brown water.  They over-charged us by billing for things we didn't order or get, and it took multiple times asking them to fix it.

This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.

The shrimp cocktail served in a fresh coconut with the meat is just amazing.  Everything else was high quality and tasty.  The shrimp with garlic was excellent and all the dishes are generously sized.

If you love beef and/or sausage sandwiches, this is the place.  Awesome flavor, HUGE portions, and greasy goodness.  All the locations are older, simple, and who cares.  You're there for the food, not the ambiance.

It's a Chipotle.  That means its consistent, you know what you're getting, and it's always fast.  If you haven't been to one before and you like fresh Mexican-style food, you have to try it.  Choose your ingredients so you get exactly what you want.  This location is surrounded by a lot of office buildings so it will be very packed every weekday during the lunch rush.  Show up by 11:45 and you'll be fine, but just after noon there will be a line out the door.  Still, it only takes about ten minutes to get through.  Or order using their iPhone app and you can walk to the front of the line, grab your stuff, and go.

This is a nice large shop with wide open spaces.  Too many cigar shops are small and packed these days.  There is a smoking room as well as space to smoke in the general shop area.  The humidor is very big and very well stocked with a wide range of selections.  While you pay the usual cigar shop price compared to online savings, the prices were reasonable and in line with being a retail shop.  Accessory prices are reasonable.  The staff is helpful and friendly.

It's an airport.  For the most part, you don't have much choice in whether you use this one or not.  But out of all the airports I fly in and out of, this is one of the nicest all around.  There are reasonable food and drink choices all over, and everything is clean and well maintained.  Bathrooms are always clean and don't stink, unlike many other airports.

Just got my Jeep back from having them do a lift on it.  The work was done ahead of time for exactly the price they quoted.  Everything looks great and they went out of their way to tell me to bring it back at 500 miles and they will re-check everything.  They also said they'd check/re-do the alignment after I got my wheels and tires put on, which I'm not buying from them (private deal from another Jeep guy).  All around everyone is helpful and friendly.  I trust the advice because they actually told me not to buy some of the extras I was considering.  Not often a store/shop will turn down money for your own benefit.  Obviously they know that happy customers will keep coming back.  As I told other Jeep owners that they were doing a lift, the comments universally were, Those guys are great, they'll do a great job."

One of the better Korean restaurants I've ever been too.  Service is friendlier than most, and the food quality is excellent.  Prices are good, too.  The Bulgogi is my favorite, and they do a really good job with it.  I'm sad that I now live across town from here, and can't make it very often.

Harbor Freight is always a mixed bag, and you just have to know what you are buying.  Either research it, or assume it's cheap and disposable.  There are lots of gems and lots of junk too.  All of my air tools have really held up well for many years, despite being half the price (or less) compared to name brands.  I have a $180 utility trailer that has held up over many years and thousands of miles.  The hand tools vary in quality, and the handheld power tools tend towards the junkier side, but usable usually.  Forget buying the cheap welders and such.  One great thing though is that they will take anything back--no questions asked--for the first 30 days.

The wings here are excellent.  The "suicide" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.

Seems like this location specializes in rude or non-caring workers.  I've been totally ignored at the window while the cashier just talked to his friend non-stop, basically throwing my change back at me.  I've had them rudely asked "Didn't you read the sign??" when their card machine was not working, but the sign had been poorly taped and fell off.  The food at least is usually mostly fresh, though on occasion they like to serve up cold/old fries.  I try to avoid this location.

This place is just phenomenal for two reasons; the amenities, and the staff.  First the staff.  They are not only well-versed in their stock and cigars in general, but exceptionally friendly and helpful.  You won't find guys standing behind a counter waiting for you to ask for help; they are always mingling among the customers asking if they can help with anything.  They know cigars and are happy to share knowledge, while at the same time not being arrogant like some other places' cigar experts.  The store and cigar lounge amenities are also fantastic.  Huge space, well ventilated, with lots of comfortable seating.  It's bring your own beer (and alcohol/wine).  There are no membership or other fees, just show up and have a good time.  You don't even have to buy cigars here, nobody is counting.  The owner is usually around and is not only a gracious host, but lets you know he appreciates your business.  He loves cigars and is truly enjoying what he does, and this shows.  The most surprising thing is how many house cigars they have.  Also how much they age much of their stock.

Overall the Discount Tire chain is the only place I'd go for tires and tire-related services, but this location was a little disappointing on my recent visit.  They took double the time they estimated to mount four tires.  If they'd just given me an accurate time estimate, I would have re-booked a meeting I had afterward.  I was late and had to give last-minute notice.  I'll continue to use the chain, but will avoid this location in the future.

The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is that it's often too noisy and crowded inside because of the sports freaks.  The patio is nice when the weather is good, and not noisy.  The wings are excellent here, particularly their two specialty wings which are unusual and very tasty.  The lavosh pizzas are amazing and their specialty dinners and appetizers rival the offerings at high-end restaurants. Decent beer selection on tap.  Prices are reasonable.

It's always a challenge running into anyone who's interested in helping a customer.  Seems like every time I need someone, I have to go interrupt a group of employees are are just standing or sitting around having a conversation.  I've tried just standing where they can see me, looking at things for five minutes, and they don't even move.  As with all BB locations, prices are steep, and to get a reasonable price you need to pull up a competitor on your phone and ask them to price match.  They match Amazon, ABT, and a few others, so be prepared for this if you want a decent price.

I love Sprouts in general, and this location was a little different yet still awesome.  It is laid out a little different from others, but once I figured it out it was easy to get around.  As always with Sprouts, the produce was exceptional and cheap.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  It wasn't too crowded.

A disappointing visit.  They have very small stock, high prices, and the employees really don't know the products.  Some of the demo units couldn't really be tried out because they hadn't wired up the parking brake lockout, or didn't have the USB connector available.  They couldn't really answer my questions, and instead chatted about meaningless stuff.  They recommended things I told them weren't going to meet my needs.

This is a very good place to get RV supplies and some boating supplies too (they share many of the same parts when it comes to the cabin area).  Service is friendly and they always have people available to help.  I'm actually surprised at how much staff is always around, usually 2-3 people at the checkout and walking around the store, and another at the parts counter.  The stock and inventory is very good, with lots of options on all the basics you need for RV maintenance and upgrades.  Pricing is decent, usually lower than places like Camping World which are just insanely expensive.  Not quite as cheap as online, but not terribly far from it either.  Since they provide good, knowledgeable help and service it's worth it.

We've been using this place since we moved to the area a year ago, and love their service and attitude.  Everyone is welcoming and very friendly to both the dogs and the humans.  Even though it's a bit farther for us than a few other vets, we'll keep going here for the quality.  Pricing is fair and reasonable.

This is some of the best BBQ I've had anywhere in the country.  I was shocked at how good it was for this simple divey joint.  I ordered the combo platter so I could try a little bit of everything.  The beef short ribs were just fantastic, and most of the time I'm disappointed with beef ribs at other places.  All of the meats were super-tender.  I was unable to pick up the pork ribs, the meat just fell off of them.  Sides were ok, nothing spectacular, but I go to BBQ joints for the meat, not sides.  Service was decent, quick to bring out the food, and reasonably attentive.  The prices were cheaper than expected for the food quality.

This is one of my least favorite Home Depot locations.  This one just seems to consistently let me down compared to others in the valley.  Hard to point specific things, but it just seems less organized and harder to find help.  All else being equal, I'd go to a different location.

We had exceptionally good service here when my wife had a recent stay for a few days.  She was transported from one of their mini-ER locations, and it all went well.  The nursing staff was very friendly, helpful, and efficient.  It was rare that we had to ask for something, and everything we asked for, we got.  They were often in the room asking if we needed anything.  The room was clean and in good condition.  Very spacious too.  Nobody wants to be in a hospital, but if I had to be, I'd choose this place.

This is a pretty good location.  It's very clean and modern inside, and well organized.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  I recently switched from Costco, and while I like both, I find a few advantages here.  For one, it's always less crowded.  Most Costcos are crowded and full of those food vendors that clog up the aisles.  Not here.  Unfortunately, the liquor selection is ridiculously bad at this location.  I have no idea why.  And what they do have costs more than at their other locations.  Seems crazy.  If you want a good whisky selection, go to the Scottsdale location.  They do have a simply awesome microbrew selection here though, at shockingly low prices.  Checkout is always fast and friendly.

These guys turn out consistently very good quality pizza and other food.  The only thing keeping it from five stars is sometimes the service is much slower than other times.  But because the quality is good and the price is right, we come back very regularly.  Their wings are basic hot wings, but they are good.  We've had several of the pasta dishes and they are all good, particularly the manicotti.  Unfortunately that dish is consistently slower to come out of the kitchen than everything else, which means my wife is usually getting it just as I'm finishing my food.

One of the better fast food burger options.  They're not dry and bland like most of the major chains, and they have a lot of interesting options.  I'm partial to the Flamethrower burger which is lightly spicy and covered with a tasty creamy sauce.  Service at this location is always fast and friendly.

Slow and not particularly friendly service.  Finally got seated, and they carded everyone, including people over 50.  One didn't have an ID and was told no beer.  For someone obviously 50, and with complete agreement that there was no question about age, "but it's just policy."  We left.

We've only used them for one trip to Vegas (two rides), but were impressed.  First off, they have an app that tells you where your car is, who the driver is, etc.  So no surprises or guessing.  Second, the driver called me the moment we were off the plane, and was already waiting for us at baggage.  So great service there, no waiting for us.  For the return trip he called a few minutes before the pickup time, but didn't rush us.  Again, they were waiting for us patiently when we were ready.  Price is about on par with everyone else, neither cheap nor expensive.  Free water is provided, and the car was clean and in good shape.  We'll use this for all our Vegas trips.

Even though we had PRE-PAID rooms, when we arrived late they had sold out our rooms.  Not just a reserved room, but we had PAID for it.  So they basically collected twice.  Then sent us to some sketchy place in a terrible neighborhood instead.  After traveling all day, last thing we needed was another 1-2 hours of finding a place to sleep, or a crappy neighborhood to deal with.  Once we moved back here it was alright.  The place is reasonably clean and nice appointed.  Hot breakfast was good.

It's a small shop but the amount of stock in the place is amazing.  They also did a very good job of organizing such a huge inventory into ways that you can see and touch everything.  I was expecting the usual stock of 2-3 choices of things, but I ended up spending a half hour poking through a dozen options on antennas for my Jeep.  The staff offered to help as soon as I came in, but then let me browse unmolested when I said I wanted to look around.  When I was ready to ask questions I got a lot of help and good advice.  They really went out of the way to help, not just move me along.  The prices are reasonable, not the absolute cheapest, but very good.  When you add in the personalized service and wide stock availability, it's a fantastic value.

There's a reason I never buy tires from any other company, and I recommend them to all of my friends and family.  They are always prompt, efficient, friendly, and helpful.  The price is usually about the same as online prices, sometimes even less.  On this last trip, someone met us in the parking lot before we could even walk in, and grabbed the bad tire out of the back of the Jeep to take care of it for us.  Every time I need tire service, they come through perfectly.  This particular location is one of the best in the city!

I really do love Costco in general, but this location in particular is always busy.  It varies from annoying to just a total zoo.  My most recent visit was of the zoo variety, and I'm simply going to avoid this location any time I can.  On top of being busy, Costco then chooses to have those food sample people standing around not only taking space, but stopping people who then hang around eating.  Ugh, it made the busy environment totally impassable in places.  The experience was so terrible that I ended up leaving with less than half of what I intended to buy.

A really well stocked store with a wide variety of products, mostly geared towards dirt bikes.  There's a little bit of street gear.  Prices are mostly retail, so not great and not terrible, mostly reasonable.  Sometimes the employees don't seem to particularly care about helping, not anything terrible, but I just never feel like they are interested really.  Always seems like they'd rather not be interrupted from their chatting.

The ONLY reason to walk into this place is to shop around a bunch of different departments and/or for the departments they actually stock well.  On my last three visits here I've noticed stock levels in some areas getting worse and worse.  When you see row after row of empty pegs and shelves, you wonder, are they going out of business??  And just TRY to get an employee to help you, much less one with any knowledge (they rarely even know if things are in stock).  This really is a self-serve kind of place and you need to know what you are looking for to start with.  And the prices of course are pretty high on most things.  They price match some online places, so be prepared for that.  Overall I avoid it unless I really need something right now, and it's Sunday.  But it may not actually be in stock anyway.

Nice and friendly service, and the food is great.  Both the pizza and the sandwiches are simply excellent.  They make their own fresh bread, and use quality meats and cheeses.  The white pizza is awesome.  The sandwiches are clearly assembled carefully with evenly-placed ingredients.  Really just the perfect sandwich.  It's a simple place, just a deli with a few basic tables.  Order at the counter from the pretty large menu.  Prices are very good.

A good local restaurant/bar with nice service and tasty food options.  Service is always good even when it is packed.  The food is just good all around, we haven't had something we didn't like.  There are a few standout wraps and the wings are very tasty.  As with most places like this, stay away when there are games on TV.  People screaming makes the place kind of loud during games.  Otherwise it's pretty typical.  If the weather is good, you can sit outside to avoid the people screaming at TVs.

Simply the best trailer service shop I've ever run into.  Every time I have something done here I'm impressed with the service and care.  The owner always takes the time to explain everything he did in detail, and anything you need to know to follow up on.  Prices range from reasonable to surprisingly inexpensive.  Last time I had a set of brakes done they charged less for the parts than what I could find online.  When you make a reservation for service they take you right in and get it done fast.

I've never bought a bike here, but I have bought a lot of accessories, riding gear, and had service done.  It's always been a great experience.  They are helpful when you are trying to decide on riding gear and get fitted.  Service is super-friendly and makes it clear they appreciate your business.  Prices are middle of the road, not cheap internet prices but not jacked up either.

Meh, what can you say about Fry's...they have a huge selection of products, and that's really the only reason to shop here.  If another place has exactly what you need--go there.  But Fry's is a great place to browse if you're not sure what you need or other places don't have it.  The check-out line is always long (or worse).  Help varies greatly from very useful to completely useless.  If you're going to ask tech questions you have to already kind of know the products so you don't get sucked in by someone that is just spouting BS.  On the other hand they have a few people who really know what they are talking about and are happy to help.  The prices here are full retail, sometimes actually even more.  The sales can be useful, but for the most part are just what you'd pay online.  If I know what I want and can wait a day, Amazon Prime almost always is lower cost overall (with shipping).  Newegg kills their prices every time unless they have a major sale.

I came by to get a quote and appointment for an electronic brake controller.  They fit me in right then and there, and they were done at exactly the time they said they would be (ok, to be totally accurate, they were done at 5:01 when they promised 5:00--LOL).  The job seems to be done well and everything works as expected.  The price was reasonable on the labor and parts, no surprises, the quote was exactly right.  As an added bonus, while you wait you can go to the excellent BBQ restaurant next door.  They also have free wi-fi.  Will certainly use again when I have trailer-related needs.

We went to this restaurant on a very busy night during some kind of city event.  We still got reasonably fast service, and it was friendly, though the place was packed.  The food ranged from very good to phenomenal.  Way more than we were expecting from a simple-looking place with a basic BBQ/American menu.  My wife decided to try the fish tacos, which she normally doesn't because she doesn't like spicy food at all and some places over-spice them.  They were made from huge chunks of fish, very crispy on the outside, tender inside, with a really great light sauce.  One of the best fish tacos anywhere.  The BBQ platter was excellent.  The pork not only shredded easily with a fork, it was almost the consistency of butter to chew on.  The brisket was some of the most tender I've had.  The BBQ sauce was really good.  Links weren't extraordinary, but still very good.  Prices are in the average range for this type of food, but the quality of this food was above anything else in the same price.  We wish we lived closer to this place; we'd be there every week.

Hey, it's your basic small-town bar, just outside the city.  One plus is they have a solid selection of bottled beers, more than a typical dive.  The menu is very simple and basic, but the food is done well and very cheap.  You get your basics like burgers and grilled ham sandwiches (served on a big Coney, weird but good).  The only sides are bagged basic chips.  Service is quick but not overtly friendly, not rude either.  Typical burger/sandwich with chips is only $4.50.  So overall it lives up to everything a dive should do--cheap good basic food.  I'd go again.  Oh, but CASH only!  No cards accepted.

It's the only Mexican food I'd drive across town for, and randomly get cravings for.  And the salsa...awesome, but also ask for their "special hot" if you're up for it.  The two top picks are the garlic pork and the adovado ribs, although I have yet to have anything short of amazing here.  Add in a full bar, a decent margarita, good service, and lots of space.

Your typical overly-sweetened Americanized Oriental food.  Everything tastes kind of the same and it's all sweetened to a terrible level.  Pricing is high compared to the food quality and portions--typical of the Scottsdale fake Asian restaurants.  Drive down the street to one of the many available small Oriental restaurants to get much better food at half the price.

This is an exceptional Thai restaurant.  The food was fantastic, and there is a HUGE menu to choose from.  You have the perennial favorites like Pad Thai on up to the more rare things like crispy fried pork bellies.  We were impressed and wish it was closer to us.  Service was quick.  Even during lunch rush we had our food surprisingly fast.

This is my third time seeing the P&T show, and I'll continue to come see it every couple of years.  Although some of the bits are the same, many change over time so you're always getting a mix of good old reliable stuff and something new.  The show is 40% comedy, 40% magic, and 20% education on some of the stupid things around our daily lives like the TSA farce and mysticism.  They package it all in a very entertaining way and you leave the show both feeling entertained and smarter than when you came in.  This time we got VIP seating through a connection, and it was really awesome.  I don't know what this normally costs, but it was really nice.  Might be worth the price as a real treat.  TIP 1:  Get there an hour early.  Penn and Mike Jones play jazz most of the time, and they play it well.  There's usually something else going on too, this time we got to go on stage and check out some props and sign an envelope that will be used in a trick.  TIP 2:  Get each person two drinks, you won't want to step out in the middle of the show.  Particularly if you follow tip 1 and get there early.

Magnum's is always an exceptional experience.  They have an excellent selection of cigars, whisk(e)y, and many other drinks.  The service is friendly and always very knowledgeable about what they sell.  If you're new with cigars and whisky, or just want to try something different, they will expertly guide you based on your tastes and preferences.  It's not cheap.  With great quality comes a cost.  But it's not exhorbitant and the value is good all around.  One of the few places in the valley where you can smoke indoors and order a drink with it.

Just not very good at all.  Most of our party of 7 people were bored half way through the show, and nobody liked it much.  Some of the comments from our group...  I don't get it.  Makes no sense.  I feel ripped off.  At half the price it would be too expensive.  I want that hour of my life back.  Could have been half as long, it was too repetitive.  None of us will see any show at this hotel again unless we know exactly what it is ahead of time.  The only reason I didn't give it one star is that there was about ten minutes worth of good acrobatics and entertainment packed into this hour and 15 minute show.  It's close though.

Meh.  Chain brewery/pub/restaurant that always seems to produce reliable mediocrity.  I end up here when others want to go, but never by choice.  This time I figured I'd try the fish and chips, since you can't screw up something so simple (or so I thought).  Well, it was the blandest fish ever, plus overcooked until it was hard and chewy.  The fries were wet, soggy, and limp.  Barely edible overall, and certainly not anything like you'd expect from a place that promotes itself as an upscale pub.  Don't bother; any random neighborhood bar is a better gamble than this known mediocrity.

I'd definitely recommend this show to friends.  Mac put on a very funny and amusing magic-comedy show that had a little something for everyone.  I particularly like how he was able to sneak in adult-themed comedy in a way that was completely benign to kids, and the show was totally kid-friendly.  Yet it still had a little mature edge too.  I'd recommend the VIP seating as it's not a lot more, and is way more comfortable than the general seating which is crowded and you sit sideways to the stage.

It's hard to pick 3 or 4 stars for this place.  On the plus side, there's a phenomenal selection of stuff, it's huge and nicely laid out, clean, and well list.  But the prices...sometimes just out of line.  For example we looked at a pistol that was $420 here and $370 at Bass Pro Shops and other gun shops.  The bargain cave is nice, and where you can find some really great deals.  Otherwise when you come here, have fun, but be sure to price shop on your mobile phone before you buy.  Their cafe is actually quite good, particularly compared to what I would expect from a store cafe.  They even have wild game dishes available.  The cheese curds are simply excellent.  Prices on the food are reasonable.

This is a somewhat fast-food style Greek and Mediterranean restaurant, but the food quality is top-notch.  We've been coming here for years and find the food quality is very consistent, always great, and the portions are very generous.  Entree prices range from $7 to $11, with the $11 meals containing multiple meats and sides.  One particular dish, the Chicken Shawarma, is impressive in how tasty the chicken is.  The combo platter offers up a very nicely spiced beef option.  The rice is exceptional here.

Yard House consistently serves up a wide variety of good food, and of course, has a huge selection of fresh beers on tap.  If I'm in the mood for beers I can't find anywhere else, this is the only place to go.  This location is particularly big and always has fast service for lunch with plenty of open seating.

It's an In-N-Out just like any other, which is good, because they make a great burger and fries.  This place gets really busy but they still hustle through it and get your food out fast.  It can be a minor challenge to find a table during peak times, but just have someone watch for tables while you wait for the food to come out.  We've always had a table open up in time.

Well, it's cheap fast food fish.  I've given it a few tries, and really just not worth it even for cheap and fast.  Half of the fish they give you has been sitting in oil and is soggy-oily on the bottom.  Fries are meh.  The hush puppies are really good if done just right, but that's only about 50% of the time.  I doubt I will be back.

What can you say about this location, it's much like any of the others.  Wetzel's has one of the best pretzels on the planet, and because they are consistent, I've never found one location to be different from the others.  Service is quick and they are always hot and fresh.

This is a rather large outdoor range with a lot of shooting options.  Even when it is very busy, as it has been lately, it is very well run with good precision and strong safety control.  They provide standup target frames for rifle and pistol shooting which you can set to a wide variety of distances.  The staff is courteous and friendly while maintaining safety across the range.

I can't think of anything I don't like about this range.  It's huge, with options for all types of shooting, good benches, and decent supplies if you need them.  On the main range there are concrete benches with seating on either side for left-handed or right-handed shooting.  There are target holders in the ground at all the various ranges you'd expect, and plenty of target frames are provided.  The frames are pretty large and good enough for a solid four targets at a time, so you have plenty to shoot at during the shooting interval.  The range safety guys are always courteous, helpful, and friendly.

Discount Tire is just great all around, and this location is no different.  Always helpful and courteous, and I always seem to get in and out very fast at this store.  There are a bunch of shopping and food options right in the same parking lot, so it's convenient to drop off the car and go do something while they get it taken care of.

This is one of my favorite Costco locations, though there are some things to watch out for.  On the plus side, they have the best whisky selection of any Costco I've ever been to, as well as a top-notch beer selection.  There are a couple of frozen food items that we love, and aren't stocked at the other nearby Costco for some reason.  Service is friendly and efficient.  But being located in Sun City, the place can be downright dangerous when the snowbirds are out in force.  So avoid Sunday "after church" time and early mornings during the week.  Other times are pretty good.

This is a tough review to write.  This particular Costco has so much to love, and then so many annoyances too.  Let's start with the good...  The gas pumps are easy to get in and out of, and prices are great.  Car wash does an excellent job, and again, in and out quick, never a line.  AWESOME selection of whisky, both Scotch and Bourbon, at crazy-low prices.  One of my favorites, Talisker Storm, is HALF the price of what Bevmo charges.  Their fresh foods like the bakery items and house-prepped items are always really fresh and tasty.  Overall the store seems to be better arranged and maintained that many other locations.  But now the stuff that isn't so great...  They have a LOT of those food demo people, all over the place, creating crowds and slowing everything down.  I often end up frustrated and avoiding aisles because there's a huge crowd of people who have no idea that others want to shop here rather than stand around tasting samples.  And being near Sun City, the average shopper age is...a bit high...and there are many people who simply don't have any awareness of driving a shopping cart or a car.  So I've been hit by carts more than once, and almost hit my car trying to park.  There are lots of people meandering the aisles with seemingly little purpose sometimes.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  You can count on any issues being taken care of completely.

Plan to spend a couple hours here learning about cigars and their art first, then enjoying one of the fantastic creations. Everything in the shop is hand rolled right there. You can choose from tobaccos aged between 12 and 100 years (yes I said one hundred). Tim Torres is a master at his craft and a great host. Bring your own drinks if you want.

I came in with a last-minute print job that I needed right away for a presentation.  Since they have an "instant" print center, I just figured they could...you know...print instantly.  I was told they couldn't start my job for "at least" three hours, maybe more.  I tried to explain my urgency and the "instant" part of their name, but the counter person truly did not care whatsoever.  On the office supply said they are alright, but sometimes out of stock on just basic things you need.  If you need help or have a question, good luck finding someone!

I just discovered this place and love it.  Aside from the usual cigar store expectations of a well-stocked humidor and accessory selection, they have one of the few smoking patios where you can also order drinks and food.  The humidor is nicely stocked including a whole bunch of rare items like Liga Privada.  It's packed heavily, but also well organized so you can see and reach everything easily.  Of course, prices are at a premium as expected in every N. Scottsdale/Carefree shop.  They aren't competing with online prices.  Still they are in the range I expect for a good cigar shop.  The patio is shared with the restaurant next door, so you can order food and drinks from them.  I'm not sure if they have full bar, but they do have a good selection of beers and wines (by the glass and bottles).  There are fire pits and ceiling fans to help tame the environment.  They also have curtains to seal out the environment if it gets that bad.  The atmosphere is super-friendly all around and we got to know the restaurant owner over a cigar.  It's clearly a small-town attitude where everyone knows each other, yet also welcomed us strangers.  We'll definitely be back.

There's something about this place that always makes me feel like I don't want to be there.  It's a little dark, a little not-so-clean-looking, and nothing really stands out as being great.  Seems to be continually crowded though, so someone must like it I guess.  But the crowd is just another reason I tend to avoid it.

Been here a few times, and always love the service, quality, and selection.  My most recent visit was for a laptop/tablet case, and the sales person really listened to what I wanted, then handed me a bag I fell in love with.  Now months later, I still know it was the perfect choice in both quality/fit and looking great (I *hate* ugly black nylon laptop bags).  The prices are a little high, but you're getting exceptional quality to go with it.  I think it's worth it.  All of my Fossil products have been long-lived and looked good the whole time.  Service is always friendly.  If you ask for something specific, they will help and do a good job of it.  If you say you want to just browse, they leave you alone to do so but remain available.

This is a review just on talking to them, I didn't buy anything yet, but still might.  I'll revise the review if they do an install for me.  I had a good talk with their installer, who really listened to my needs and what I wanted to do.  He was helpful and engaged, unlike all the other places I've visited in the last few days trying to get a new head unit for my Jeep.  They promised to research my questions with the manufacturer and get back to me, which is far more than anyone else was willing to do.  It's a small shop in an old gas station, but the stock is pretty huge, including lots of install supplies.  I would recommend a visit.

It's a Harbor Freight store, which means it is a lot like most of the others.  However this one is particularly clean and well managed, which makes it one of my favorites.  Stock is good, shelves are kept organized, and even though it's always busy there are rarely any lines at the register.  I think one day I'll ask for the manager and say thanks.

This is a simple-looking Italian restaurant in a small strip shopping center, but don't let the looks deceive you.  The menu is varied, and every dish I've tried has been fantastic.  The Calzone is stuffed full of excellent cheese and whatever ingredients you choose to add.  It's sized as a meal for two.  The lobster raviolis are excellent, with lots of real lobster chunks.  No fake fillers or small quantities here.  Even the salads are exceptionally prepared and great.  It's a little ways from the more commercial parts of the city, but worth driving out to.

Food that's almost as convenient as a TV dinner, but fresh and unprocessed.  Everything we've tried so far has varied from great to spectacular.  Top favorites are the soufle and the Greek pork loin, with the whisky steak also well worth a mention.  The idea is great; they put together all the ingredients for a great meal, then you take them home in baggies to either cook fresh or freeze for later use.  The menu changes monthly.  You go to their site, choose your meals and portions, and set a time to pick up your stuff.  It's now much easier to put together an excellent fresh meal at home without spending an hour or two in the kitchen.  Be sure to ask them about their inexpensive veggie trays as an easy side dish.  They are not on the menu, but they usually have some available.

This marina is rather run down now, and it was not a great build to begin with.  The dock planks are all loose and splintery (don't walk barefoot!).  The dock fingers are flimsy and wobbly, to the point of being dangerous at the ends.  There are no cleats (!!) anywhere, just these weird metal loops you have to pull ropes through.  They don't sell ice at the marina store.  How weird, huh?  You have to walk up the hill to the restaurant to get a little 7 pound bag of partially defrosted and refrozen ice.  The service was friendly, but with a lot of rules.  They'd smile while telling you that you can't do this or that.  I have to say the guys at the haul-out were VERY friendly and helpful, and did a great job hauling out my big cruiser for me.  The restaurant is your basic pub style fare, nothing to complain about and nothing to really talk about.  Beautiful lake, but I wouldn't choose this marina again.

It's a pretty decent place, better than most of the "family" type hotels along the strip.  Our room was clean and well maintained, as was the rest of the property.  The bars and restaurants were good, reasonably prices, and easy to get into except for the burger joint.  Crazy lines there.  Our checkin was reasonably fast at about ten minutes.  The sushi restaurant in the casino was exceptional, and the Italian place was also very good.

First the good...service was friendly and fast considering that the place was ridiculously packed.  Unfortunately the high marks end there.  I had one of the most disappointing burgers of my life.  The meat was cheap and overcooked to a level I don't think I've seen before, even though I specifically asked for medium-rare.  The bun...seriously??  It was one of the worst generic cheap buns I've ever seen.  Not what you expect on a $12 burger.  The bacon was likewise cooked in a nuclear oven.  I like it crispy, this was just mostly inedible.  Beer selection was pitiful, so no reason to go for that.  Overall, there's zero reason for any person to ever go here.  Oh, I forgot to mention how over-priced it is.  Even if the food was great the price would be higher than other places with the same food.  Considering they use the cheapest ingredients possible, it should cost about half what it does.

Very good wings, really nice and friendly service.  The price is great.  I haven't tried the pizza or other menu items, but the wings were unique and nicely done.  As I said, the guy running the place is very friendly and helpful on deciding which wing flavor I would like.  I'll be back.  The building is older, but everything is clean and inviting-looking.  Seating is basic, nothing out of the ordinary.

Everything I've tried at this place has ranged from excellent to phenomenal.  It's a very simple place with a limited menu of fried chicken, pork chops, catfish and other basic Southern food.  The catfish dinner is one huge(!) slab of fish with a really tasty batter.  The okra gumbo, available only on weekends, is excellent (try a couple dashes of hot sauce to liven it up).  On top of that the prices are cheap.  Service is friendly, and while sometimes they get really packed and it's a bit slower, it's never bad.

Simply awesome place, one of the two best Italian restaurants I've ever been to anywhere.  Service is fast and efficient, and the food...simply phenomenal.  The bread is perfectly fresh every time.  The salad dressing, while rather simple, is surprisingly great for some reason I can't put my finger on.  We've always loved it.  The dining area is very small with just simple tables, and there's a small patio area.  I've never had to wait for seating however.  They don't have any sort of a bar but there's a selection of a few wines by the bottle at a reasonable price.  Note the name is "Italian Grocer" and their roots are in selling some great deli meats, bread, and ready-to-use home-made pastas.  You can get top quality meat and bread to go as well as a variety of their pastas and sauces.

A pretty nice lounge/nightclub with a variety of seating options.  If you get there early, you can grab a comfortable couch in the back.  They play music at the usual loud levels, but you can still hold a conversation back in the lounge area.  Good music selection and DJ.

One of the top sushi restaurants I've been to, and I've tried them all over the country.  It's the only place in the Phoenix area that has a conveyor belt, where small sushi plates come around for you to grab as you wish.  The owners are almost always there and they make sure to greet every single customer.  They get to know everyone and treat you like family every time you come in.

I like this place a lot.  Such a variety of unusual items, all arranged by region or country.  It's a big store, so there's a lot to choose from.  You also get some standard produce and meats along with the unusual and the wild...Durian anyone...?  On the downside sometimes stock of particular items may be thin or out, I'm guessing their supply shipments are spread out a lot since everything is imported.  Prices are reasonable, and the service is pretty much what you expect.  Fast but not necessarily friendly or even understandable.  Still, you know that when you walk in the place, and deal with it.  Plan to spend a long time browsing on your first visit.

This is a really awesome Mexican food joint with a specialty in seafood.  I've never failed to be impressed by any dish they make.  Some are unique and tasty, like the shrimp in cream sauce soup.  I've never had anything like it, and it's super-creamy and awesome.  They have an appetizer/side that is shrimp inside a chile wrapped with bacon.  Sure, go ahead and read that again, it's as good as it sounds.  The chile isn't very hot so it should be within almost anyone's spice range.  Along with your meal you get a half dozen sauces/salsas to pour on to your taste.  The creamy chipotle sauce is really really good.  Ask for it with your chips, it's that good.

Generic chain "BBQ" that really doesn't deserve to be called that.  It's not awful, just fails to be great in any particular way.  Pretty much zero smoke flavor, and they doused it some sort of grease sauce before serving it to us.  BBQ is served as-is, and the eater gets to choose what, if anything, to put on it.  This place is clearly aimed at people who don't really it BBQ.  I kind of figured from all the annoyingly kitschy signs and decorations all over the place.

This place always serves up tasty American/pub-style food, with decent service and speed.  The only down-side is they can be pretty noisy because of the sports people yelling at TVs during games, but avoid those times and it's a nice place.  The wings are tasty and there are a few good beers on tap.  One of the few places in the area where you can smoke a cigar on the patio.

This would be a five star place if it wasn't located in Desert Ridge, which is just a huge pain to drive in/out of and within the center.  Definitely don't go during rush hours (drive time and lunch time).  Otherwise, the store is just really well stocked and the service is always helpful.  The Scotch expert always seems to be around when I'm shopping for Scotches and has really helpful advice and knowledge on most of the stock.  He's certainly helped them sell me more whisky, and helped me discover new stuff I like.  Great beer selection too, and growler fills.

First the good; service was fast, efficient, and friendly, and they have a pretty decent beer selection on tap (not phenomenal, but decent).  Unfortunately, all the food I tried varied from the low end of mediocre to just bad.  Their pretzels and pub cheese appetizer was awful.  The "cheese" resembles that awful oil-based stuff you get in a convenience store and they tried to doctor it up with a bunch of bell peppers and similar things to make it more than just fake cheese.  It doesn't work.  It's just inedible.  The pretzels themselves were good.  The waitress brought us their "nacho" cheese which is the same stuff with different spices added; still bad.  I ordered the grilled hot wings for my dinner.  They were the most rubbery wings I've ever had.  I can only guess that they heat these in a microwave instead of frying them.  They grilled them for a few seconds and sent them out.  The sauce was ok, not hot, but the rubbery texture was too distracting.  I won't be back.

Busy and slow.  Every time I come here it's pretty packed and it seems like it takes forever to get my order.  On top of that it's the always-questionable Starbucks quality/flavor that's a 3-star on their best day.

I really enjoy this location, it's really huge.  Service is fast and consistent.  Like all other Paradise locations, there's a great variety of menu items.  The only real downside to this location is that parking is simply awful during the lunch rush in the middle of the week.

An excellent burger joint with a lot of other offerings.  I love a great burger.  Unfortunately most places overcook them and nobody else offers all the options that this place does.  The menu is unique in that you build your burger with dozens of options from the plate up.  I was going to say from the bun up, but you can even get it as a salad or lettuce wrap if you prefer no bun.  The options range from the typical cheddar and bacon, through interesting things like cranberries, various sweet and tangy sauces, and excellent alternative cheese options.  The garlic aioli combined with the horseradish mayo is awesome.  Sides go from the usual fries to some excellent house garlic-parmesan chips and sweet potato fries.  There is a full bar and a decent selection of non-generic beers available.  The owner is usually milling about talking to customers and helping the staff work.

Breakfast was excellent, really on my top five lists of best breakfast joints anywhere.  The corned beef hash is great.  Portions were generous.  Service was attentive and friendly.

It's probably just the area, but this location is one I try to avoid.  It's just kind of dirty and low-quality all around.  If you're in this area and need a post office, it probably won't pay to drive farther.  But don't come here by choice.

The decor is simple modern, not pretentious but very nice.  Service was attentive and friendly.  I found the tortilla soup to be absolutely excellent, and others in my party said the same about the Ricotta Dumplings.  I had the Truffle Glazed Top Sirloin with Bleu Cheese Potato Gratin.  Unfortunately my steak was quite over-cooked (I ordered rare, got medium or more).  I didn't address this issue with them, as I hate waiting for something to be done over again.  The others who ordered their steak medium got what they wanted.  Disappointing but not awful.  The sauce was excellent as were the potatoes, with a good, strong cheese bite.  The Creme Brule was very good, and while not the best I've had, it's near the top.  There is a reasonable wine selection and they did a good job on my martini.

Awesome wings, especially the "Skybox style."  A surprisingly great item is the five-cheese sandwich with a cup of their amazing tomato-basil soup.  It has four cheeses inside and is grilled with parmesan on the outside to make it ultra crispy.

While not stellar, this is a good solid, high quality sushi joint.  It's near us so we've been here quite a lot.  Service is always friendly and quick, and they have good selections of special rolls along with the basics.  The prices are on the low side, and they always give you one free standard roll with any specialty roll you order.  Appetizers are inexpensive and tasty.

This is a very good drive-through car wash.  It's not full service, you ride in your car through the automated tunnel and then do the interior yourself.  The machine does a very good job on cars, but only an OK job on larger vehicles with large tires.  The tire shine doesn't cover the 35" tires on my Jeep or on the pickup I had before it.  But it does a great job on our Z4 and other normal-sized vehicles.  The monthly pass is a good deal if you're near this area often.  TIP:  On Mondays after rainy/dirty weekends, the place is packed and takes a long time.

Most Apple stores get a five-star rating from me, but this location always seems to be a little more challenging.  The parking is awful.  And it's always packed and takes longer to get help than any of the other locations.  Still, like any Apple store once you do get help it's efficient and friendly, and always what you need.

This is a very nice place, well stocked with both cigars and beer. The only thing keeping this from being a five star review is that the ventilation/filtration is insufficient for a cigar lounge. I'd go much more often if it was better. The staff is great and the owner is usually working the store. They know their cigars and are very friendly.

Had a really great lunch here.  The place was really busy, but service was still pretty fast.  The food portions are GIGANTIC and you can't leave this place hungry.  Prices are in line with the quality and huge portions.  The fried chicken is excellent, as was the cheese and grits.

I guess this place is just "meh."  Not terrible, but there are more consistent car washes to be had.  On some visits things look great, and on some they leave obvious problems.  After my most recent visit I got home to find big clumps of mud still stuck to the steps and flaps on my truck--how can anyone miss that?!?  The price is on the higher end of usual, so I expected more.  I have one more pre-paid wash coupon and won't be back after that's used.

This is an updated review, I had reviewed it with two stars before.  I thought I'd give it one more try, but certainly never again.    Today I had their VIP wash for $20, which is the best they offer short of a full detail  They left dirt in various places on the dash and on/around the center console.  Not just little corners but huge areas of dust and dirt.  Carpets didn't appear to have been vacuumed at all, or if so, very poorly.  They made the windshield dirtier than it was before I drove in, since I had cleaned it that morning very carefully.  After the wash it was streaked badly.  The tire cleaner was applied haphazardly.  I specifically asked the attendant about having the plastic fenders treated with vinyl protectant and offered to pay extra to have it done.  Of course, they were not.  Avoid this place, they simply can never get it right.

What a dump.  And always over-priced compared to other stations.  Just to make it more fun there are usually hood rats prowling around, and one time a hooker didn't want to take my "no thanks" for an answer.  I go by it regularly so it's convenient, but really need to stop going here.

We've been using this company for nearly two years now.  They are super-reliable, and if they are going to be even just a few minutes off schedule they will call and let us know.  We live just outside their normal service area but they still come out here reliably.  The dogs seem to love them, and they always come back looking and smelling great.  They add extra work as needed like when one of ours goes through a shedding fit, or has allergy problems.  The people have always been really friendly.  The price is actually a little less than we were paying a chain pet store.  The dogs hated going there, and we had to drive to them and wait around for an hour.

I've been to this location a few times for routine services and for new tires twice.  The service is friendly and efficient like it is at most Discount Tire locations.  Their time estimates for getting work done have always been accurate, which is important to me so I can work it in between other appointments with my customers.  Every time I compare the price, nobody else sells them for less, even online.

Most pizza places tend to be fairly typical and vary in quality, but seem common.  This restaurant always surprises with unique flavors and top quality in all of their ingredients.  From the crusts to the sauces to the toppings, everything is top-notch and consistent.  The dough is flavorful with just the right crunch on the outside and great texture inside.  Beer selection is excellent.  There are plenty of non-pizza menu items to keep things interesting and to accomodate for any diet needs.   One of the top pizza joints in town.

Ugh, this place never fails to annoy me in some way.  First, the parking is always a zoo.  There is some street-level parking, but very little, so you mostly have to use the parking structures.  Even if you just need to dash in to grab something, like an online pre-order, you often find the 5-minute loading zones to be taken.  I've seen cars in there for over an hour.  And then the valets will often cone off a bunch of premium spaces for their high-tipping customers.  Of course, everything in here has to be over-priced to pay for the high cost of being in a mall like this.  And the people...avoid this during the day mid-week, when the unemployed kept women flood the place with their attitude and pretentiousness.  Or go and sit by the fountain and enjoy it.  You could play a good game of one-up bingo listening to them compete with each other for most pretentious story and show of wealth.  I only come here now if someone insists on a meeting at one of the restaurants and I can't talk them out of it.  Well, iPic is a really cool theatre experience.  At least if you go late on Sunday the parking is alright.

This place was just fantastic all around.  The service was fast and very friendly.  We chatted with the baristas and servers for a bit, and they really know their coffee and products.  I had a double Macchiato that was prepared perfectly, and the coffee was so sweet on its own that I didn't want any added sugar.  Their BLT has a soft egg on it, making for a very tasty sandwich that I keep thinking about.  My wife had some sort of caramel pastry that seemed to be made of lightly cooked cookie dough with a huge slab of caramel in the middle.  It was simply stunning.

The food quality here is always good, and the portions are generous.  It's not uncommon to share a single meal, like the chicken-fried chicken, between two people.  That dish in particularly is a monster.  The BBQ is done very well, and all of the choices are excellent.  They offer a sweet KC style sauce and a tangy/spicy cajun sauce.  You can buy the BBQ as a combo with sides, or just plain meat by the pound or half pound.  There is a full bar with good drink quality and a few non-generic beers on tap.  Pricing for food and drinks is reasonable, with only a slight premium for being at a marina.  Service is always efficient and ultra-friendly.  Unfortunately they have totally unpredictable hours and you can't count on them being open when you want to eat. Management was completely changed recently and not for the better. I can't figure out what they are trying to do but the disruption hadn't been good.

Most seating is outdoors and well covered, where you can see a great view of the lake.  There's a full bar as well as regular table seating.  The menu has a huge amount of variety for a small restaurant at the marina, with a few items that are outstanding.  Of course the BBQ meats are great, and what everyone expects from a BBQ joint.  A couple of others are the crispy chicken wings, the fish tacos (grilled not fried), and the chicken fried chicken sandwich.  Service is good, friendly, and fast.

This is the only car wash that has never annoyed me with some little problem.  Seems like every other place regularly misses something, even in a high-end wash, but these guys always do a great job.  Prices are not cheap--but match the level of service given.  I've also never run into one of those glass salespeople there, which really annoy me.  Overall this is my preferred wash/detail company in the Phoenix area.  Their store is very nicely stocked, and waiting room seating is very comfortable.

One of the better Target locations.  Very clean, well lighted, and well stocked.  They have a lot of excellent house-brand foods that my family loves.  There is rarely a line of more than a couple people to check out, so it's a pretty efficient place to shop.

The previous reviewer incorrectly said they don't have take out; they do.  In fact you can get your take-out in one of three ways; walk up, radio ahead and pick up without even leaving your boat, or have it delivered out to your boat in a slip.  The marina itself is an excellent facility and very well maintained.  The staff goes out of their way to make your time enjoyable and stress-free.  Everything we've asked for has been met with a friendly "yes" and just gets taken care of.  This is in start contrast to the other marina on the lake, which we moved from.  The facility itself is constructed of wood docks over floating platforms.  There are excellent and spacious shower and bathroom facilities for the slipholders.  Everything is kept well maintained and clean.  There is a fuel dock, pump-out dock, restaurant, reasonably stocked store, and the marina management office is on site.  The store features the usual boating necessities and some major items like batteries.  Prices carry a little bit of the usual on-the-water premium, but I've seen far worse.  Service is friendly and helpful from everyone involved--managers to fuel attendants.

An excellent full-service marina facility.  They have everything a boater needs; fuel at a reasonable price, pump-out, food, convenience store, and great docks.  The service is excellent and pretty much everything we have ever asked for has been met with a friendly "yes!"  An excellent place to keep a boat, visit for a weekend, overnight, or the day.

Pretty good stock, with stuff arranged so it's not hard to find.  The service is pretty good, sometimes they are a little busy and slow, but they are always nice and very helpful.  One of the better small hobby shops in town.  Prices are on par with other shops.  I'll keep going back.

We used this marina for a few years, but the service level and overall quality has really gone downhill.  We finally moved out as they reduced or eliminated more and more services, and replaced the long-term and knowledgeable employees with new people that don't really know anything.  It's difficult to get anything done or any help here, and if they agree to help you with anything, the hourly clock is always ticking ($$$).  The attitude is the final straw; they act like you're disturbing their work.  Overall the facility is middle of the road.  The docks themselves consist of concrete pavers over floating structure, and are *impossible* to walk on barefoot.  They are too hot in the summer, and the stony surface cuts your feet in any weather.  This is disappointing for a marina.  There is a large restaurant/bar facility, but the service is extremely slow and the prices are astronomical.  Food quality is middle of the road.  There are fuel and pump-out docks.  The service docks are a little small so there is often a wait to pump out or fuel.  They let people park at or near the service docks and walk to the store, tying up precious space.  Fuel price is decent and the pump-out stations are well-made and function well.  Slip prices have gone down lately as so many people have moved out due to the lack of quality and service.  There may be bargains to be had if you don't mind the negatives.  Just watch your contract, some people have reported that the price on the paperwork varied from the verbal price given.

It's easy to hate on car dealers, they have a challenging business, and the entire industry seems to be at odds with the consumer.  That's why I waited quite some time before posting a review.  I'm going to give very little opinion here and just let the facts speak for themselves...  Purchase:  Our dealings with the sales people were pretty typical.  However the finance guy repeatedly lied to me about the extended service options and other coverage options (not a matter of opinion, he outright told me things contrary to what they said in writing and I had to point it out).  I ended up requesting a different person later in order to get the service plans that I wanted.  And that person was simply awesome, helpful, honest, and attentive.  On the first service trip in, they were supposed to do a paint sealant re-application (Zaktek), computer upgrade, alignment and check a few things.  First off, it took them a day longer than promised.  When I picked it up, I found that they hadn't done the Zaktek at all.  And the alignment didn't help the pulling problem, but now the steering wheel was crooked!  It was straight when I drove it into the shop.  I just did another visit to get the Zaktek application done.  They did it this time, and it was done by the time promised.  But they left a bunch of extra product in various places that dripped down the side of the Jeep. leaving big white chunky streaks of the product in five places around the vehicle.  They couldn't wipe this off?  The service writer tried to sneak in a $15 "necessary oil additive" on the authorization form on top of their expensive $45 regular oil change.  I had to argue to have that removed, and to have them just use exactly what the book recommends.  I also reminded him that the web site showed a $5 off special.  Of course, when I picked it up, the $5 off wasn't on the bill.  I'll bring it in for the things I absolutely have to do at the dealer, but otherwise the Jeep goes elsewhere for all services.  UPDATE:  A few days after the service, I decided to double-check all the fluids since I was doing a 700 mile trip and towing a trailer.  I found that the coolant was very low, and they hadn't checked the power steering at all.  I could tell because the PS fluid bottle and cap were covered with oil and dirt which hadn't been disturbed.  So even with the very expensive oil change, they didn't bother to check and top up the other fluids, which every does with an oil change.  UPDATE:  I called the person who replied to the review and left a voicemail.  No response at all after a week.

This is a small but well-stocked auto parts store, and the service is particularly awesome at this location.  It's always cheerful, helpful, and efficient.  When things aren't in stock they always arrive in less than 24 hours, and they call reliably to let me know when they are ready to pick up.

Good no-frills cleaner.  They do a good job, it's always done on time, and the price is good.  You won't get any extras like bags, night drop-off, and stuff like that, but you do get a good low price and clean clothing that is nicely pressed.  It's the only place I go to any more.  Tonight they let my wife in to pick stuff up when she got there after closing.  That's an extra star in my book.

I've been coming here for about three years, not sure why I never got around to reviewing them before.  Guess it's something I just take for granted.  First off, the service is friendly and super-fast.  I doubt I've ever spent as long as a full minute in the place.  The cleaning has always been effective and I've never had any issue with the service, out of hundreds of items that have been in and out of here.  I dry clean all my shirts other than t-shirts so I'm here pretty often.  The price is great.  They also have coupons in community fliers with further discounts.  Recommended.

It's hard to review this place because well, Harbor Freight seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it type of place.  Some people just can't stand the tightly packed stuff or the general feel of the place, but bargain hunters immediately see the huge variety of low-cost goods they have here.  This location, in particular, was cleaner and more organized than most.  Some locations are really run down and less cared for.  While you can find some real junk here, there are a lot of gems to be found also.  Their air tools, for example, have never let me down.  They sell for 1/2 or less of the major brands, and have always worked just as well for me.  I would NOT recommend things that are supposed to be sharp, such as drill bits, saw blades, and the like.  They are almost always junk.  Their hand tools have a lifetime warranty, and while I only have a couple of them, they have worked just fine.  This is THE place to buy the little stuff like gloves, brushes, cleaning supplies, and similar items that you just can't screw up.  The price on nitrile work gloves is about 1/4 of any other place.  Look coupons online before you go!

This place has great food quality and the serving sizes are ginormous. We got the $40 family combo plate and took home enough for another full meal. The combos are a great way to sample all they have to offer. Everything was good, with the stand-outs being the falafel and the Kafka.

This is one of the better Home Depot locations I've been too.  It's particularly clean and I can usually find some help in a reasonable time.  Not always, some days it just seems hard to find people.  I like the efficient self-checkouts, the ability to use Paypal, and to use Apple Pay.  Also getting your receipt e-mailed; much more convenient than paper I have to scan!

It's a little bland and Americanized for our taste.  It's not bad by any means, but not great either.  The self-serve salsa bar is good, but unfortunately it's also necessary to give the food any real flavor.  Even though it's the closest Mexican to our house, we probably will drive farther for better food.

I went in for a full detail with a Groupon.  The work was done on time and looked very good.  The one thing keeping this from being a five star review is that they really went way overboard on the vinyl protectant, and I had to wipe it off areas like the steering wheel and door handles.  Otherwise the car looked very good.  Also they have work areas set up with computers, and a large lounge type of area with nice chairs.  I waited for the car to be done and just got some work done with my laptop in reasonable comfort.

I've only been here once, but will come again when I'm in the area.  The service was super friendly, and pretty quick (though it was a little after the normal lunch rush time).  Wings were tasty.  I didn't have the pizza, but the table next to me did and I overheard them commenting approvingly.  Sure smelled great (maybe I should have traded a couple wings for a slice).

It's amazing that they are stil running this place the way they do.  Even on a Saturday or Sunday in the heavy season, there are few patrons and the service is still unbelievably slow.  On our last attempt to have breakfast here, it took us 55 minutes to get served some eggs, bacon, and the usual.  Prices are pretty high, food quality is just middle of the road.  I suppose this is why the other restaurant in the area, Dillon's, is always packed while this one is empty.

Always great service and excellent food.  As someone else said, one of the toughest things here is deciding which dish to go for.  My wife usually goes for one of the crepe or similar dishes, and I've always had one of the steak options.  The "hanging man" steak is simply amazing.  The flat iron steak, covered with garlic-herb butter and perfectly caramelized onions, is simply the best flat iron steak I've ever eaten.  On top of this, you get a selection of rare beers on tap.

The food quality and flavor is a 5, but the service is a 2-3.  This is billed as a cajun seafood restaurant within Talking Stick Casino.  It's really just a tiny little corner of the casino with a bar arrangement and about half a dozen tables around it.  It is really tiny.  So during meal times it takes forever just to get seated, and the services is pretty slow even after that.  On the other hand, the food quality is simply fantastic.  The crab/shrimp cocktails are big and the quality of the product is great.  All of the dinner dishes are generously-sized and very good.  You simply won't leave here hungry, or disappointed in the flavors.  For those who don't like "cajun" style foods, there are plenty of seafood items that are plain and simple.  The crab cocktail, for example, is served with a tasty but mild creamy remoulade.  There are a number of other non-spicy options available.

Quick, high-quality sandwiches and other quick offerings.  The portions are generous and everything was high quality.  Service was good, though it is just counter service (then you can eat at the nearby sports bar, keno, or the small restaurant seating space).  Tip...there's a discount coupon in the book you get on hotel check-in.  Oh, and the desserts were ridiculously large and very tasty.

This is very good BBQ; not the best I've had, but certainly one of the best.  The service was quick and friendly (you order at the counter).  Prices are about typical.  The "restaurant" is a simple arrangement in an industrial complex.  Don't expect ambiance here, it's just a place to eat really good BBQ.  They have a good assortment of tasty BBQ sauces at each table.  Try them all!

I had a very good burger here.  They have a bunch of pre-selected burger combos plus you can make your own from their pretty extensive list of options/toppings.  I ended up creating a monster that could only be eaten with a knife and fork.  They also let you choose a salad as your side, unlike most places that force you into fries or the like.  The one thing that keeps this from being a five-star review is that they brought the burger out over-cooked.  They say they cook to order, and I asked for medium rare, but got medium well.  Nobody wants to eat dry over-cooked meat, and although it wasn't terrible, it doesn't rise to excellent either.

The pricing of the monthly unlimited is good, and it gets you in and out quickly.  However the wash itself is never quite right.  The tire shine applicator misses parts of my tires almost every time.  The blow-dry machine is not very effective, and leaves several specific areas spotted every time, such as the driver's side mirror.  This location was purchased from another company, and the machine here just isn't as good as what I've seen at other Clean Freak locations.

I really like this lounge/cigar bar.  The atmosphere is comfortable, nice without being uptight, and the staff is pretty helpful.  They allow cigar smoking both indoors and on the patio, which is huge.  It is enclosed from all sides so you are protected by weather (but also don't get much air movement if it's really hot).  There is a good selection of whiskies and various other liquors, at typical bar prices.  Nothing great or particularly expensive, but good all around.

This is THE place to come for nitro-powered helicopters; nobody else in Phoenix is really supporting them like they do here.  The help and advice they've given me has been amazingly valuable and they are always friendly and supportive to people just learning to fly.  Other strengths are electric helicopters, and nitro and electric planes.  Pretty much anything that flies is well-supported here from beginner to expert.    Cars and non-flying models are also available.  They even have a flight sim you can use in the shop, and have weekend flying get-togethers.  Really a shop that supports the hobby rather than just looking to make a buck.

I like this place a lot. It's not a high-end Mexican place by a stretch, but they do a solid job at making really tasty meals for a really cheap price. It's amazing how fast the drive-through can be even when there are 15 cars lined up around the building.  Service is friendly and quick both inside and in the drive-through.

Simply the worst wings I've ever tried in my life.  Just awful.  They were rubbery (do they cook them in a microwave?) and small.  The "butter" garlic sauce was some sort of petroleum-tasting margarine that even my dogs weren't excited to chomp on (and they eat their own poop).  The lemon-pepper wings also had a very strange artificial taste to them, and equally rubbery.  The pizza is pretty much just a huge pile of bland dough with minimal amounts of toppings.  They must use a high-precision laster to cut pepperoni that thin.  I wouldn't take it as free food.

I hold coffee in high regard, well above religion, food, and everything else.  So when I find a place that makes a truly fantastic espresso, I'm very surprised.  This is certainly in the top five that I've had anywhere in the world.  When you get a macchiato it is not only made with perfectly thick foam, but they give you a nice design on top for that visual appeal.     On top of that the shop is well lighted because of the big windows and looks clean and inviting.  I use it for short meetings in the area or to get a little work done, and find myself energized and comfortable when I'm working there.

When you head to the ER, you're under distress and have no idea what to expect.  When we got here, we got some simplified paperwork to get started and were into a room in less than five minutes.  There was immediate service with 2-5 people always in the room doing testing and taking care of things.  In less than an hour we had answers and a treatment plan.  Staff was friendly and caring.  I can't think of anything I'd change.

Overall this was very good.  Service was friendly and fast.  The menu has some unique and interesting items, in particular some of the cheese plates were really great.  The pretzel dip appetizer was really awesome.

I absolutely LOVE the wings in this place.  Both the golden extra hot and regular extra hot are some of my favorites on the planet (they are really hot though).  Try a mix of both for a different kick.  The other menu items are tasty and high-quality also.  In particular their fried cheese sticks in wonton wrappers are simply awesome and worth a try.  Of course, being a sports-type place, avoid the game times unless you like noisy crowds.  Otherwise the place has a decent noise level and the service is fast and efficient.

We just moved into this neighborhood, and called them for the traditional moving pizza.  We were shocked at how good it was, and the ridiculously fast delivery.  21 minutes from the phone call to delivery.  The quality of the pizza is excellent, and the ingredients are fairly generous.  When we asked for garlic, we got a generous portion of nicely caramelized garlic chunks, which was just phenomenal.  Since that first night we've ordered three more times, and been very happy with it every time.

Probably the best doctor's office I've ever been to, and Dr. Linkemann is certainly up there with the best.  The most important thing I can say is that he takes all the time needed to listen to you, talk about your needs, and do a very thorough exam.  He also takes excellent notes on a laptop so followup visits don't have to start with re-hashing the previous discussions and visits.  The office staff has always been excellent and I never have to wait to be seen.  I'm usually brought in before my appointment time.  I don't think I've ever had to wait past my appointment, which is rare with almost any service.  They're very tech-aware so you can request appointments right on their web site and view your medical records online.  I usually get an appointment that's within 24 hours of requesting it.

Simply awful.  We had heard a few people rave about this place, and now I wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage.  The "cheese" is this awful petroleum grease product with yellow color.  That was the worst of it, but nothing was good at all.  And crazy price to boot.

I like Subway all around, and this is a good location.  During lunch and dinner rushes the place can get really packed, so I generally try to avoid those times if possible.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Since there's so much traffic you know everything is rotated and fresh.  Pretty easy location to get in and out of.

Friendly service, and super-fast to get in and out.  Didn't have to wait, and I was out the door with the new title and registration in under ten minutes.  Didn't even pay attention to what their service fee was since the whole thing was pretty cheap (older vehicle).  I think you'd be crazy to stand in MVD's lines and put up with their bad attitude.

This place is ok, but we probably wouldn't go back.  The good part is the nice selection of draft beers, and good friendly service.  However neither of us were impressed with our meals.  I had a house burger, which was rather thin, dry, and overcooked (ordered medium rare, they say they cook to order).  Not terrible but just a rather generic burger.  My wife ordered a spinach and cheese dip that had extremely little cheese.

One of my favorite burger joints anywhere, they have a nice variety of pre-arranged toppings as well as a build-your-own option.  It would be five stars if they'd let you get a rare burger, but alas, like a lot of places, they only go from medium to well done (overcooked to charcoal in my tastes).  The bacon is thick and excellent, and the bread is top-notch.  The garlic fries are awesome--standard and sweet potato both.

Service was excellent and friendly.  They treated us well during every treatment and kept us entertained with good conversation.  The manager/owner was gracious and welcoming.  Sure, pricing is high as with any in-hotel spa, but not out of line with that standard.  The facility was nice and very clean.  We'll be back!

Very tasty place for a quick lunch that's hot and fresh.  They really only serve one main entree; chicken fingers.  They do that really well though.  They are tender, juicy, and the coating is light and crunchy.  The drive-through is efficient even when there's a long line.

This is an excellent, modern facility with good security and very friendly, helpful service.  We moved in a couple months ago and have been very pleased with everything.  Our sales guy was helpful but no-pressure, and continues to stay in touch to be sure we are happy.  The security guys are friendly and helpful.  The design of the facility is well done and highly reliable.

What a cool and fun place.  Lots of eclectic weird stuff everywhere, so you can always browse for amusement while waiting.  And some cool nice products, like a really fantastic hand lotion I've never seen anywhere else, and candles with unique scents.  The food is stunningly good, prepared every day starting at 4am.

This is an excellent German restaurant.  Service was excellent and super friendly.  Everyone in our party agreed the food was truly exceptional.  We learned that they make their own sausages and the flavor/freshness/tenderness showed it.  They also make their own sauerkraut, which was super tender and had just the right flavor without being over-powering as it often is for me.

This is a lot like most basic neighborhood bar/restaurant places, but with a few nice added touches.  Their wings are really tasty, and more than the usual boring bottled sauce offerings at most places.  They have a spice-up bar with a whole bunch of sauces and chiles to throw on your food to taste.  And a pretty nice large patio area.  Overall a place I'll want to come back to.

This place is seriously over-rated.  The Zagat reviewers that called this one of the best burgers should be put into a rocket and shot into the sun.  It would be alright if you were looking for a cheap fast food burger, but the price implies it's much more.  The bacon cheeseburger is $6, fries are $5, drinks over $2.  The burger is over-cooked and a bit on the dry side.  They use some kind of runny goo they call "cheese" but is pretty nasty both in flavor and consistency.  I do have to say the ingredients like tomato, lettuce, and onions were fresh.  The bread is fresh but ultra-generic grocery store quality.  Low on flavor and just boring.  The fries are excellent, but for $5 they better be.  They are the thick soft style, so if you don't like that style, you won't like these.  I do like them and they were good, just not quite $5 good.  The burger disappointment really took the enjoyment out of the fries.  You'd be doing just as well by ordering the higher-end burgers at a chain fast food restaurant.  Or go to Culver's or In-N-Out for a higher-quality burger.

Our stay here was great all around, even though the hotel is currently doing some construction work.  The service was polite and excellent all around.  Our room was clean, comfortable, and very nicely appointed.  Great large bathrooms and just nice all around.  We spent time at the pool for a Yelp event, and really liked it.  There are good views all around and the bar is easy to get to and well stocked.  Aside from the restaurants right in the hotel, there are a whole lot of very good options within a couple minutes of walking.

It was a total pain in the butt opening an account here.  They demanded a ridiculous amount of paperwork and it was always an emergency where I had to drop everything and bring it right over.  I should have just said 'no' and gone to another bank.

Just go there.  Check it out.  No matter who you are, they have something in stock that you can use.  It's like having multiple department, sporting goods, office, and home improvement stores in one giant warehouse.  Also imagine it as everything on Craig's List all in one place and without the hassle of dealing with unreliable people and schedules.  The prices typically beat CL prices so you don't need to haggle, but if you do think something is priced improperly, they'll discuss it.  Top that off with friendly service and pretty good hours.

As a beginner, all I can do is review the service and general look of the store.  Everyone is friendly and helpful, and the store is wide open with lots of space and very well organized.  The selection looks quite broad from my inexperienced view.  The shooting area is bright and open, with all the things you need for comfortable and safe archery.  We're taking one of their family classes and like it so far.  Would recommend it for any beginner, and it seems like experienced archers should check it out too.

I like this place a lot.  They have a very strong selection of foods from around the world, not just oriental food.  The shelves are heavily stocked yet well organized, not cluttered.  Service is pretty good, if you need to ask for something there's usually someone around.  Prices are decent.

Updated review:  Over the years this place has become better and is really good now.  The food is excellent and served in generous portions.  Service has been exceptionally friendly and helpful.  There's one little oddity in that they charge for their tzatziki, but oh well, it's not much and it's very good.  Every meal I've had here has been a great example of Greek cooking.

Excellent subs really fast.  There is a wide variety of light to large, simple to meaty and fulfilling.  One neat option for the health conscious is that they will make any sub in a lettuce wrap instead of bread.  They are always crazy-fast, prices are reasonable.

Certainly in the top ten for airport food.  The food portions are generous, and while you're overpaying because it's an airport, it's not too ridiculous.  Service has always been fast and friendly for both food and drinks.  They have a pretty good selection of craft beers too.

This QT is big, clean, spacious, with great stock and really easy to get from/to the highway.  Hard to know it's even here if you're on the highway, but it's one of the most convenient gas/stores on this stretch of SR-101.  Always fast service too.

I've never gone inside this branch, but regularly use the ATMs because the location is close to where I often am anyway.  However, it's a real pain to get in and out of the place due to the way it's situated on the corner.  If traffic is heavy, forget it.  I only use this location if I'm not going to be driving by another one.

Pretty neat place, with a lot of unique dishes.  The tacos al pastor were excellent, very flavorful, very fresh all around.  All of the flavors were somehow both powerful and not overwhelming, a great balance.  Service was very good and friendly.  When you tell them you haven't visited before, they give you good useful information about the menu, options, sides, and the like.  The only down-side was that my wife specifically asked about one dish being spicy or not, and she was told it wasn't.  But she's very sensitive to spicy foods and found that it was too much for her.  However they offered to take it off the tab as soon as she mentioned it.  I'm a salsa fiend, and found them to be far better than average.  Prices were reasonable.  Not super cheap, not expensive.

This could be the best beef/sausage combo sandwich I've had in my life.  The food is consistently great, and service is efficient and friendly.  The hot pepper topping is a must, unless you're not into spicy obviously.  Ask for a little extra, it's that good.

I've tried Five Guys twice now, and both have been very disappointing.  I don't get what some people rave about.  First off, the price is insane.  Over $15 for just a regular-size cheeseburger, fries, and drink!  The burgers are very dry other than the weird sticky "cheez stuff" they use instead of real cheese.  Even the grilled onions failed to have much flavor.  The fries were nicely crisp on the outside, but have a faint taste of bad oil to them or some other off flavor I can't quite ID.  The free peanuts were quite good.

Awesome place with a lot of relaxed indoor smoking space.  The service was excellent and everyone was friendly.  They feature a decent selection of high-quality beers as well as a few wines.  The humidor is very nicely arranged and easy to browse through.  They have excellent air filters, so even your non-smoking friends may find it acceptable to hang out in here for a few beers.  I'll definitely be back again soon.

Updated review after a couple more visits.  It could be five stars with some improvements, but it's still really good.  The food I've had is great.  I love the XXX wings, though the price of $10 for 8-10 wings is quite steep compared to any other place I've been to.  Service has always been good, fast, and cheerful.  The beer selection isn't exemplary but good, with a few non-generic beers on tap.  Same with the liquor selection, not large but all the basics and a few mid-level premiums are available.  I expect I'll hit this place up about once a month.  Note:  Cigar and cigarette smoking is allowed on the patio, whether you think that's good or bad is your decision.

While the service was very good and friendly, the price quote for glasses was simply outrageous.  The exam price itself was a little higher than others, but not terribly so, and the service was excellent.  However the glasses were about 40% more than my previous optometrist who also provided great service.  I decided not to buy from them, but would consider using them for the exams in the future.  If the glasses prices were reasonable, it would be a five-star place.

This is the best Vietnamese cafe that my wife and I have ever tried.  When I brought some home, she pretty much immediately had a craving for more.  The service is typical for oriental-style restaurants; basic, but effective.  NOTE:  You pay at the register.  There's a little sign by the register telling you to do this.  Nobody ever sees it, since you'd only see it if you were already going to the register...  The ambiance is simple, and everything is clean and in good shape.

Best place to park for the airport.  Large, well-lighted lot that's easy to get around.  The trains are very regular and take you to the terminal very quickly.  Service is good if you want to be taken between the train stop and your car.  TIP:  Show up 90 minutes before your flight and you can early-check your luggage here instead of taking it to the terminal.

I love this store, and it's my primary place to shop.  The produce prices are MUCH lower than the mainstream stores.  Sometimes by half.  Other items vary, and there are some very expensive foofoo specialty products too, but the day to day staples are always well priced.  Back to the produce, it's always very fresh.  Customer service is exceptional.  Everyone really seems to love the customers.  Employees jump to help if you ask, and show you were things are instead of just pointing.  They've gone in the back to get better produce when I grabbed the last item left and they saw it was a little wilted.  The selection of bulk products is excellent, and also well priced.

Simply awful location.  My most recent trip was at prime dinner time (6:30 on a Saturday) and they still managed to give us terribly stale food.  The biscuits were crunchy all the way through.  Seriously, how long were they out to get that way.  Completely hard.  The corn was dry and shriveled.  The "extra crispy" chicken was barely crispy in some parts, and mush in other parts.  Stay away from this location.

A necessary evil that we all have to go to eventually, the most you can ask for is a shorter line and get in and out quickly.  Well I had never noticed this location before, as it's hidden off the street.  Watch carefully for the blue emissions testing sign, I drove right by it the first time.  I found this particular location to be faster than most, and with friendly employees.  They were helpful and courteous, and I was in and out promptly.

We like this place a lot.  All of the important points of a sushi place are here...  Good fresh fish, very good construction, good service, some unique rolls, and a reasonable price.  They have a few house rolls that are fun.  They vary them and post them on a board behind the sushi bar.  Be sure to check that.  My favorite is one with tempura-battered jalapeno and a few other spicy items in a roll with tuna.  Service is always prompt and friendly.  Be sure to ask for the fresh wasabi (costs extra, and well worth it).

This place has surprisingly great food.  I say that because it's a simple-looking restaurant that appears more like a diner than a high end restaurant.  But they pull off some really great things, from the breakfasts to dinners.  Their pasta dishes are impressive in the quality and abundance of the expensive items like large shrimp.  Service has always been smooth and friendly.  After about five visits here, I can say they are consistent and there have been no issues.

One of the best airport restaurants anywhere.  You'll get top-quality food and fast service here, unlike most in-airport restaurants.  The menu has a decent variety from simple to high end.  There are some neat sandwich options like the ham with Gruyere and some other unexpected ingredients (forgot them all now).  If you're keeping it light there are several very good salad options.  Price...well it's upscale food at an airport, so it's not cheap, but I didn't feel it was out of line either.

Just simply amazing BBQ meats.  No reservations, no "buts," this is just the best BBQ meat I've had anywhere in the country, including Texas and all of the South.  Show up early, they keep selling out by shortly after noon, as more and more people figure out how good it is.  The brisket can be cut with the side of a plastic fork, and they give you the option to select fatty, drier, or burnt end if there are any left.  You can't go wrong with a mix of all of them.  On top of that, they are super-friendly and inviting.  They treat everyone like family and like the valued customers that they are.  The "restaurant" is just a simple dining area and some picnic tables outside.  You're not here for the atmosphere, you're hear for the smoked meats.  I also haven't tried the sides at all yet.  I just order meat.  Why bother with anything else?  This review is short because it's simple--awesome food with awesome service.  Just go there.

Surprisingly good food quality here, and the portions are huge while the prices are low.  The chicken-bacon-ranch roll looks small in the picture, but it's the size of a baby's arm and only $3.  Pizza is better than any other food court pizza.  And it's all really cheap.  TIP:  No cards are accepted, cash/check only.

This is a new, rather large location.  There's lots of room between tables which makes it more comfortable than some similar places that are very crowded.  Food is very good, as it is at all their locations that I've tried.  My favorite is the golden wings, which are unique and very tasty.  Choose your heat level.  I've had the hot and extra hot, with the extra hot being my favorite.  They really aren't that insane in spice level, but the pepper flavors really come out nicely (and now I'm drooling while writing this review).  Unfortunately, it is a sports bar so on certain nights of the week and certain seasons it's just loud and full of people screaming at the TVs.  It would probably be a five-star place if it wasn't for the often-annoying environment that creates.  There's a pretty decent-sized patio too, and that stays pretty quiet.  Service has always been efficient and friendly.  I have been to this location a half-dozen times, and have never had any problem with slow service or any other issue.  It's very consistent.

This place is great all around, and I'm here a few times a month.  The wings are excellent, and completely unique.  Particularly the golden wings.  I've never had any wings like those.  The menu has a pretty huge variety and everything I've had is good.  Another unique and tasty item is the mozzarella sticks, which are wrapped with a wonton wrapper instead of the usual breading.  Service is pretty consistent.

One of the best cigar shops in the country for a few reasons.  It's small-ish, but very nicely appointed and comfortable.  The clientele is extremely varied in demographics, and very friendly.  I always end up talking to people I've never met before.  The shop staff loves what they are doing and it shows.  There's a selection of the basic standard cigars everyone stocks, but then also a bunch of interesting and unusual stuff.  You can BYOB as with most shops.  You won't find a friendlier shop.

Huge lines and very stale coffee.  Yeah, it's an airport, so it can be busy, but they still could make the effort to have fresh coffee.  This stuff was clearly at least a few weeks old.  I've had Illy from people's refrigerators that tasted fresher.  Service was "meh" at best.  The employees clearly didn't want to be there.

My friends and I totally loved this place, and still talk about it.  We've only been there once, and will be back again.  We used one of the long-range platforms to shoot my new .50 BMG.  This is the only range in the area that welcomed and supports this caliber.  The platform is atop a small hill, allowing you to shoot throughout a small canyon into the hills.  There are steel targets spread out on the hill from about 100 yards to 1000 yards.  Some are in the open and some are slightly obscured by brush.  You get a lot of options for what you want to shoot.  The platform itself is huge, with a small counter all the way around to set your stuff on, and a big artificial grass mat to shoot prone.  (And it's not crappy thin stuff, it was a thick, comfortable, realistic grass.)  We were on our own for shooting, with no distractions or "cold periods" to let shooters go on the range.  The price is not cheap, but worth it for the amenities and lack of crowds you normally see at public ranges.

First I'll say that the only reason this isn't a 1-star review is that they have some phenomenal seating available.  Nice electric recliners with plenty of room are the only way to watch a movie!  Unfortunately, these scumbags made us sit through 21 minutes of ads before the movie started.  That's no exaggeration or guess--the movie was scheduled for 7:00 and started at 7:21.  After paying for premium seats and the premium cost of food and drinks, making us sit through 21 minutes of ads is completely unacceptable.  We won't be back again.  Other premium theaters like iPic spare you from ads and start on time.  We're all used to insanely over-priced popcorn, but at least at some theaters you get butter.  Not so here, just some awful "butter flavor topping" that you can apply.

I love this place, wish there were more of them around town.  It's pretty simple; you have a selection of a few teas on tap and ready to pour, plus dozens more that they will make to order.  I tend to go for the coconut black tea, which is reminiscent of a Mounds Bar without the bitterness.  Service is friendly and quick.

I love Sprouts stores, and they are my primary place to shop.  This location is brand new and I've just started using it sometimes instead of the one on Deer Valley.  I can't decide which location I like better, but they aren't hugely different.  The produce prices at Sprouts are MUCH lower than the mainstream stores.  Sometimes by half.  Other items vary, and there are some very expensive specialty products too, but the day to day staples are always well priced.  Back to the produce, it's always very fresh, better than anywhere else overall.  My wife loves their very limited and selective artichoke stock (only a few, only the best ones).  Customer service is exceptional.  Everyone really seems to love the customers.  Employees jump to help if you ask, and show you were things are instead of just pointing.  They've gone in the back to get better produce when I grabbed the last item left and they saw it was a little wilted.  The selection of bulk products is excellent, and also well priced.  They beat Costco on nut prices.

It's a convenience store.  How can it merit five stars?  How can it merit an excited review that's glowing with praise?  Read on...  This place is new, so it's obviously clean and in good condition.  Beyond that, the layout is just excellent for browsing the HUGE selection they have.  It's roomy, you're never bumping into other customers even when the place is full of people.  Aside from the usual selection of c-store items, they have many more options.  There is a pretzel/sandwich/smoothie stand right inside.  The beverage cooler selection is simply immense, as is the selection at the fountain.  Like most QTs, service is fast and super friendly.

Good food, good assortment of tap beers, and really friendly service.  I was in Pittsburgh for a few days and found this on my first day.  I ended up going every night during my stay, and would go again.  Surprisingly good food for a simple-looking bar.

This is a good basic self-wash place.  The building is old and looks terrible, but the gear all works perfectly, which is what matters.  I've used it a bunch of times and have never had a problem with the equipment.  Down-side is they use tokens, so you're stuck with buying a lot of them just to be sure you don't run out.  I'd use it more often if they just did quarters.

I loved this place.  The food selection is pretty broad, with a lot of options for anyone's preferences.  There are some great healthy options like the roasted veggies, which were delicious.  As long as the standard mediterranean fare.  Service is order at the counter, with table delivery.  They were fast, friendly, and efficient.  The food was delivered within a couple minutes, even though it was lunch rush.  Everything was tasty, and as expected.

Got in and out just fine, and didn't have issues like others reported.  As to the person who claimed "lies," what they told me was that the first monthly on the monthly pass was discounted.  I thought that was pretty clear, maybe people mishear that it's a monthly pass.  It says so right on the huge sign, and on the paperwork they have you sign.  However the tunnel just doesn't work well on my Jeep.  Maybe it's just too tall and the tires are too big, but I did ask the employee and he said he thought it would be fine.  The tires were only half covered with the tire protectant, and there were small parts of the vehicle still dirty afterward.  Probably works just fine with a normal car or small truck.  There is shaded space to dry/vacuum your car after going through the tunnel.  The vacs were very powerful and effective.

It's decent, not great.  The roll variety was kind of minimal and everyone commented that they all sound the same.  They were all very similar.  Service was good.  Price was very low, so that helps balance out the value.  We found one of the tuna sashimis rather bland, thought it's usually full of flavor.  Don't know why.  They do have fresh wasabi, which certainly helps.

This is an entirely new concept in pizza restaurants that will upset the industry in several ways.  When you walk in, you'll see an ingredients "buffet" similar to what some sandwich shops do.  Walk up and start your order by telling them what type of crust you want (regular unprocessed wheat or gluten-free).  I got the standard, and it tastes great.  Then you choose your sauce.  I can't remember all the options, there are many.  I went with the spicy red sauce, which isn't really all that spicy, just more flavorful than a standard sauce.  They caution you to not pair this with the more delicate ingredients like buffalo mozzarella or you may mask their flavors.  Now onward with your cheese selection(s), there are a few.    At this point you'll be handed off to the next person for your meat selections, if any.  You'll find the standard fare, plus a few things like real smoked bacon (most so-called smoked bacon is just flavored that way), and turkey-mushroom meatballs.  From there you move to veggie selection, and again, they have the usual plus some nice extras.  Roasted garlic cloves, roasted bell peppers, and more.  At the end you can choose some optional extras like an oil drizzle, oregano, etc.  Then they take it away to bake it.  I was shocked at how fast it was done.  Since the crust is nice and thin, I guess they can cook it more quickly?  Everything tasted great.  The ingredients have a focus on quality and healthiness.  They are sourcing hormone-free organic ingredients.  The crust is simple, with little processing and no junk.  There are no fillers in anything, and the sodium content is much lower than in most other pizzas.  Their nutritional info is on their web site, and I was shocked to see how low most of their pizzas were in calories and sodium.  On top of the awesome pizza, the salads are great.
