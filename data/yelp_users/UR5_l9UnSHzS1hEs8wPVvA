I was attending an art class that was being held at this location, so my friend and I came early to take advantage of happy hour. The bar area was full, but not packed, and had maybe 3 or 4 servers, which wasn't quite enough.   We couldn't get anyone to actually approach our table to take our orders. The two times we were able to actually order anything, we had to flag someone down. It's like we were invisible. The tables around us were getting service, but no luck for us.   When my friend's drink finally arrived there was a bug floating in it. Again, when we FINALLY were able to flag someone down and tell her that there was a bug in the drink, she looked at us as though she pitied us for not understanding the value an insect can add to a cosmo, gave us the sympathetic head tilt and said, "ummm...it's a fruit fly." Oh, well then. I didn't realize. I thought it was a bug, but now that I know it's a FRUIT FLY, I'd like to keep it. In fact, do you have a few more you could sprinkle atop my beverage? Thanks.  At least they didn't charge her for the drink. Oh, wait. THEY DID. Yes, we got to pay for the fruit fly cosmo, because, well, FRUIT FLY.  I hate chain restaurants anyway, and this experience did nothing to change my mind.

I agree with everything everyone else had said here. The landscaping is barely maintained, they close the pool for "annual cleaning" for two weeks in the MIDDLE OF JULY, and the office staff is completely incompetent. They only selectively enforce the lease provisions, and have told me that a dog barking non-stop is "normal apartment noise" even though the lease specifically states that pets must not disturb other residents. They actually told me that parking backwards is "against state law" when there is no such law in existence. I'm doing everything I can to get out of here and I would tell anyone considering moving in to run the other direction.

I really like the food, I do. It's good. My issue is the service.   The signs say they close at 7. However, they lock the front door at 6:40 and if you knock, you're out of luck. If they want to be out of there by 7, then they need to change their hours to closing at 6:30 and be done with it.

Stopped by this place for lunch yesterday while running some errands. The chips were nice and light, and they mix in some flour tortilla chips that are a greenish color which I assume means there's some guacamole flavor or something. I didn't get a ton of that but they were still good. The salsa was really good. Bright, nice texture, balanced flavors.  I ordered the green chicken chimichanga, because, duh, chimichanga. The chicken was all white meat, juicy, finely shredded, delicious. The portion sizes were good too. I have but two qualms and it's really kind of just nit-picky stuff.   First, they try too hard on the plating. It's Mexican food. There's no need to be prissy about it. In their defense, they're close enough to Troon that prissy plating is probably required by some city ordinance. But seriously - forming your rice in a pyramid and trying to keep it all separate? Please. Either you make a pretty plate OR you put shredded iceberg lettuce as a garnish, but not both.   Second, it appears that there's a white woman from the Midwest working in the kitchen. As I said, the chimichanga was delicious and the green chile sauce was lovely, however, it seemed to have a cream of mushroom soup base and they put actual large chunks of mushroom in the sauce. Mushrooms, In green chile sauce. On a chimichanga. Just let that soak in a minute. Then in their little cilantro lime rice pyramid, they put peas and carrots. That's right. Actual peas and carrots. In cilantro lime rice. At a Mexican restaurant. Weird.  As I said, the qualms are nit-picky. The food was overall quite good and the service was attentive without being annoying. Definitely going back. I'll just ask them to hold the peas and carrots.

I recently moved back to Phx from San Francisco, so needless to say, I'm a little spoiled on the restaurant front. So far, I've been happy with the direction that Phx restaurants are taking and I really enjoyed Federal Pizza.  A friend and I visited this weekend and we had the burrata appetizer and the Big Red pizza. Both were amazingly good. They had a great selection of local and craft beers and a good wine list. We didn't have dessert b/c we were full, but I certainly would like to try some of what they had on the menu.  They are down a star for one reason - OPEN TABLE - heard of it? For pete's sake TAKE F%#@ING RESERVATIONS, at least on the weekends. It's super good food and people are going to go there. It would be so much easier if one didn't have to wait 1.5 hours to get in. It takes the pressure off you guys. If I've been waiting for hours, it had better be some flipping good pizza. Reservations. Take them. We'll all be happier.

Disaster. This place is a nightmare. It's relatively new and already doesn't look it. And, I had one of the worst checkout experiences of my life. I got in line and the line was long and getting longer. There were 2 cashiers one of them had a very large transaction so the front end supervisor hopped on. All of a sudden, one of the cashiers, who was dressed as Bon Qui Qui, stopped ringing and started processing her go-backs IN SLOW MOTION. She would periodically look up and notice the line getting progressively longer, but continued to move at the pace of molasses in winter. She has a promising future at the DMV. After nearly 10 minutes of this the front end supervisor told her that she wasn't supposed to start that until 2:45 (it was now 2:40 and she had been at this for 10 minutes) and that it shouldn't take her more than 5 minutes. Clearly she hasn't seen her in action. Or inaction. The girl acted like this was new information (I doubt it) and went ahead and started ringing. I swear there was steam coming off the entire line. It was totally ridiculous. I will absolutely never shop here again.
