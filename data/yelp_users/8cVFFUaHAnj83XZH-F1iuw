Worst physician experience of my life. Spent a total of 10 minutes with the spine specialist, and that's only because I had the nurse bring him back into the room to spend more time with me. Got the bill today...$399 for 10 minutes! Unbelievable! I'm in the wrong industry if a specialist can literally not even examine a patient and make hundreds. Shameful.

Just got married at Arizona Grand and it was amazing! Booked a 2 bedroom villa, which was beautiful. It overlooked the golf course, which provided the perfect backdrop. And the pool was right across the street! We have two boys, 2 and 4, and they LOVED the pool, especially the wave pool. The only reason I'm not going with 5 stars is the food and drinks at the pool are a bit pricey...$18 for nachos. And the room could have been cleaner...hair all over. But overall the experience was great and we are definitely hitting it up again!

We use to go to this place all of the time, until this past Saturday night when three out of the four of us ended up with food poisoning. I feel bad for posting this review, but for those of you who are reading it just be careful. We will never go back, which is a shame, but for so many of us to get food poisoning is not a coincidence. I'm just wondering how many other guests ended up getting sick that night as well.

So my pets are like my kids. I mean, I rank my kids just slightly above my boy Buck, a 5-year-old Healer mix. He's by my side every second of every day, which is why I will always be leery about here we take him and who works on him. Dr. Glenn and Dr. Schmidt are awesome. They go out of their way to make you and your pet comfortable, as does the rest of the staff. There's no place else I would take my pets, especially Buck. I trust them completely.

LOVE Geno's! They use to be good, but just stopped by there the other day and they must have improved something because it was better then good. Haven't tried their pizzas yet, but that's next on the list.

So, truthfully I've been a Dunkin Donuts gal for many years. But then Bosa moved in just down the street and I tell you what, they have the very best donuts! Sure, they don't have some of the great breakfast sandwiches that Dunkin has, but their donuts are a thousand times better! Mmmmmm
