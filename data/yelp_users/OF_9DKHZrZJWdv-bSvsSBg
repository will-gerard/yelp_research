Just beware. I used to take my dog there. She was attacked. Not enough supervision. Karen was blaming my dog and made me feel so bad. She did pay half the vet bill in a somewhat timely manner. Wish things would have worked out because it is a great concept. Same experience happened to my friend Kim and her dog.

Hands down... Brooke is who you should see. She has done my hair for over 3 years and has taken me blonde to red, to brown to ombr√©, extensions, cut short and back to platinum blonde.   Every time I do something new with her, which is monthly :) I get asked constantly "Who does your hair?"   Brooke is very experienced, has great vision, reliable and you can be sure when you leave her chair you will look fabulous!   Etch Salon is great.. Friendly staff and has great energy! So so happy I found Brooke Stanley.. Can't imagine having anyone else do my do :)
