Horrible experience.  We ordered 3 entrees. General Tsos, Chow Mein and the Warer boiled chicken.  The Tsos and Mein were decent at best. The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef.  We told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb.  No Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab.   Bad customer service as far as I'm concerned.   Tip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills

Drove all the way here for what was supposed to be killer food and dessert.  What we got was the following.  ATTITUDE!  Sorry but when you go out to dinner you shouldn't have to deal with attitude having wait staff and managers.  The pizza was very very average, maybe they had an off night?  The desserts were all fantastic. Although we couldn't order them with our meal the way we were told we could in the bakery area. So we had to finish up, pay and then go back to the bakery area to buy desserts.  The good: Salt on the tables is a very good salt and as a chef myself I appreciate that. The desserts are top shelf. Artichoke heart dish was interestingly yummy.  The bad: Service was horrible. Manager was rude. Pizza was decent at best.   Will probably stop in for desserts if ever in the area but would'nt step foot in the restaurant side again unless it was free.

Had a piece for a few days before it had to go back for repairs.  Now realizing they did not do the down fill like they agreed to on the cushions. They did a foam and after 1 month in our house they are already getting a pretty major indentation. Cheap cushions unfortunately.  It's a $5900 sofa set that I would say is worth $2800 max. Wasn't happy with the pricing either. A "level 8 for the price of a level 5". The leather on the leather match Natuzzi is much high quality.  All in all, disappointed. Here is a tip. Don't choose your leather from a 3" swatch and only get a level 10 or better if you go here.

Dr. Mark Woodland did such poor work on fillings in my families mouth that the next dentist we went to said we should file a lawsuit.  Not only is his work 2nd rate but we are seriously considering filing a suit.   This man should not be practicing Dentistry.

I ate "The Bobbie" which the girl said was their most popular. Well I guess I'm not a conformist excuse it was a fairly bland sandwich that basically just takes like canned shredded turkey and chewy bread.  Not a fan.

This is Vietnamese food for North Scottsdale white folks who have never had Vietnamese food before.  It's a fast food style place that gives you food with very little flavor and tells you to start adding sriracha and oyster sauce util it starts to taste good.  Really really bad.

Fantastic!   It's a grocery store and has a diner in area as well.  We had the Princess Platter and its $22. It's a bit pricey but that fed both of us and had us pretty content. Not an insane amount of food for $22 but enough and will be a solid meal.  We also had some white cream cheese dip appetizer that we didn't love. It needs something else like a ground hot beef or gyro meat on top. It's a bit tart.  They gave us a little $1 Baklava to try for free. It's about 2 bites but also delicious.  So the big question everyone would have that is into middle eastern food is how does it stack up to Haji Baba. Well, it's better in all ways except for the Shawarma and the Garlic Mayo. I'm still not sure why no one else makes their shwarma and garlic mayo like Haji!!! Drives me nuts.  The beef at this place and Gyro is def better than Haji. The beef Shawrma was fantastic. Haji has horrible beef in pretty much most forms it comes.  Great spot!

Horrible customer service. Ended up telling them to give me back my car as price kept changing. Great place to go if you don't mind being nickel and dined to death.  That's just bad business. Give a person a price and stick to it.   Make sure to get the total in writing and signed by the manager!   This place won't be in business long.   When we first came in to book this appointment we should have been tipped off by the way they were talking to a lady who ticked off about being overcharged.

Being from New Mexico I thought id go here and have some amazing Green and Red Chile dishes. Not so much. I spent 14yrs in New Mexico and know New Mexican food very well. This is a fairly bad knockoff of what New Mexican food is.   Si Senor is a bland chain in New Mexico that is reaching to capture other markets apparently. This is no Los Cuates!

Excellent service. Excellent food.  Everything here was perfect so I'll just mention the few things I did not love.  The Vegetable Ratatouille which is just a side didn't really wow me.  The Chocolate Soufflé needs some more cream or some ice cream.  The Bone in Ribeye is amazing!! Ask for the sauces on the side and ask for some pepper on the side! It will be 3 different types of cracked pepper. Awesome.  The Escargot dish and the Foie Griot was both amaZing!! Like cream in your pants type amazing. Can I say that on yelp? That just happened!!!  Shut YO FACE!!!!  This is a small restaurant. Much smaller than expected. The service was great. Tops.  Tip: Order a la carte.

This place really fell off for us with this last visit. We tried all new things and they were all terrible.  Sicilian pizza was awful.  Burger of the day was tasteless.  Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Bacon was the bed thing by far and it was just ok.  The Sweet Potato side dish that everyone seemed to be getting was awful. What was in that beets and raspberries?? Eugh  Disappointing visit. We usually love this place.

C'mon folks. Anyone going more than 3 stars here is being silly.  This is about on par with Filibertos except in a much dirtier environment. Dusty non air conditioned dining area with super uncomfortable seating. This is a very LDS style hodge podge of a dining area. Whatever could be found at the Thrift store if I had to guess.  Nice people working there though. Don't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town. People in this part of AZ are very very dry.

Been comin here for awhile. Just found out the make the best Brisket in the Valley. I'm in love.  All of thier raw meats are amazing as well Sausages and Burritos that are to die for. Many things frozen as well. Dog treat etc.  The main place this shines to me personally is the pulled pork and the ready made Brisket but they are definitely known for selling raw meats.   Good folks.

Sadly its starting to go downhill. This used to be our go to spot for Brisket every weekend. Now they must be letting some new guys run the place or something because the Brisket is sliced WRONG.  Brisket can only be sliced 1 direction or its ruined! Get your stuff together folks.

I was not only blown away by how uninterested the girl was that was teaching this "Cookie baking class" this Novermber but how RUDE she was to the only male that was in the class with us!  It was like she was extremely upset that a man decided to take the class and treated him rudely the entire time. I was bothered by it the entire time. Not only was I bothered by it but myself and 3 other girls all told him after the class that he should ask for his money back. And he should.  I would not recommend the Sweet Basil classes or cooking school to anyone that is looking for a pleasurable experience as the blonde lady who teaches the classes (i believe her name was Melissa) seems absolutely miserable and unhappy with her job.  Hopefully the owner reads this and takes note.

I love wings as much as anyone but this place loses me with their over preparation of its wings. EVery sauce seemed to be loaded with thick syrupy candy. Tasting any chicken is an afterthought with these wings, its all about the sauces. Which to me, are way too sugary.  Tried 5 different flavors, the JAlapeno one was by far the most tolerable.  The atmosphere is sports bar and the acoustics of the building could not be worse. A guy screams because of a touchdown on the other side of the bar and it will send shocks up your spine as you sit on the most uncomfortable sold wood booth seat ever.  Pass.

The owner is the exact opposite of our experience with Thai people. Horribly rude man. Will never go back. Even though the food is great. Probably the best Thai in town.   The Garlic Chicken is top shelf and they are the only ones who make anything like it.

This is a 5 star clinic but is held to a 4 star because nothing in the entire place seems to have been updated since the early 70's when it opened.  The Dr. Bramley was a Vet here for years and turned it over to his son Dan. Both are fantastic veternarians who charge very reasonable fee's for their service.  No appointments, it's all walk in and often quite crowded. Expect to wait 45+ min.

Nice people running this place. It's downfall is it's complete lack of style. You will feel like you're in a fat bachelors living room. The place is a mess and most likely many health code violations are going down in this joint.  That being said, the owners couldn't be nicer (although not the most chatty) and the coffee is good. They need some music however and maybe some younger people working there.

The owners should probably train their wait staff to be proper.  When a table is done and they have paid their bill it would be very nice you did not ignore them completely and go and pick up their chat. Until the customer leaves the restaurant it would be proper to continue to serve and refill their drinks.

Got introduced to Indian food here back in 1998. Have sicne become quite an afficianado on it.  The ownership has clearly changed hands here. Its run by mostly kids now and its not very authentic tasting Indian at all. The buffet is now one of the worst Indian Buffets in town.  If you want a quality indian food experience, try Kebab Palace, The Dhaba or India Gate.

Im not a vegetarian so take this review with a grain of salt. I found the place to be a bit dirty and the food to be lackluster.  It was OK but if you want healthy and veggie I feel like Chop Shop is a much better type of option. This place is trying a bit too hard to be trendy. Hipsters working the counter and overall feeling of dirtiness to the place.  The Ice Cream is good but it's soy. Do your research on Soy before getting too excited.

Very solid middle eastern food in a below average location. Chicken shwerma was the outstanding as was the Taboule and Gyro meat. Very reasonably priced as well which is good because the atmosphere is quite bad and the neighborhood is not the greatest.  Also, do yourself a favor, don't look into the kitchen when you're paying. Just don't. Clearly the health inspector is being paid to look the other way at this place. At this delicious place!!

Ordered 2 pizzas. A Margarita and a Wiseguy which everyone raves about. $15 and $18 each.  The Wiseguy needed a lot of help flavor wise. All 4 of us agreed it was OK at best.   The Margarita was very good and on par with places like Cibo and Grimaldis but 100% NOT WORTH A 90 min wait.  We planned to come to this place for 5yrs and finally did. Probably will not return. There are many MANY other great pizzas places in the Valley and this one is mostly HYPE.  Oh yea..  No Chris Bianco  No Parmesan  No Crushed Red Pepper Flakes  Pass....

$17.50 for one cheeseburger with bacon split into 2.   Need I say more? I think not. The waffle fries were very good that came with the burger and the bartender was very friendly. The bottom line is this place is very expensive.  Also the price of a single beer was $7.50. That is insane.

Sadly this place is nowhere near as good if go around 2pm in the afternoon. 4 waitresses all just sat around the bar eating, speaking Spanish and we couldn't get service at all. Had to turn on the fans ourselves, keep getting up to ask for refills etc... Not good!  Happy to fix review when they fix screwing up our company lunch that cost us $240

Tried again because 2 people in our group insisted on trying it. Sat outside as a party of 6. Birthday for 2 of the people.  Its OK. The pizza that has pears and arugula on it was good the very first time we went but this time was just LOADED with arugula and they put it on right before bringing it out vs right after it came out of the oven. So it never wilted. The pizza just didn't seem very fresh and was fairly dry.  We also had the antipasto and it was fairly lackluster with unripened olives all over. Huge ratio of olives to everything else. A bit stingy with the meat.  Service was sterile. Still not sure who our server was. We probably had 3-4 diff people come by from time to time. Had to get up and find someone to ask for a check. Being seated outside here you really feel like you're fairly forgotten about.  Hopefully won't be back. Too many better offerings now in the valley for pizza.

If this was REAL BBQ I would never eat BBQ.   I ordered a pound of Brisket to eat there. Got a plate of what looked like a mish mash of chopped and sliced brisket. Very dry and had little to no seasoning at all. Ended up taking it back to the counter and asking for our money back.  Head up the street and got some real Brisket. I gave it a try, oh well.  If you want good Brisket folks, don't go here. You go to Rynos, Pork Shop or even Porkopolis but you don't go here.

Dropping them a star for my last experience. Bartender could not have been less interested. No excuse when there are only 2 couples in the entire restaurant at 5 on a Monday!  I won't be coming here when Michelle is working the bar anymore. The experience of sitting at a bar and enjoying some drinks and food is meant to be shared. She would drop off a drink and run to the other side of the bar. No type of personal connection. With Randy its the complete opposite. The owners should take heed of this.

Solid Salads and Pizza served by mostly hot young girls wearing tight shorts. Not sure how you can really go wrong. No wonder all the Mormon dads choose it as #1. (that was a joke about how horny mormons are)   Everything other than the pizza and salad here almost always dissapoints. Including the following which we have now tried on various occasions and its been quite unremarkable: Wings, Deep Dish, MEatballs, Pasta dishes, Appetizers  If you go here for the thin crust pizza and a pizookie you will be happy. Oh yea, solid beers on tap too.

This is a quality Thai Buffet I have been going to for many years. Only downside is the best dishes they only bring to the buffet in small quantity and it gets picked over completely if you aren't the first 3 people there. They should make the crunchy chicken in large quantity.   People could be more talkative also.   All in all, quality Thai for $10. Is it as good as Thai Buffet on Dobson? Probably not simply due to the fact the people at the other place are way more personable and will make you whatever you want.

Inept!  Brought our dog in for a consistent cough.  The vet we saw here "Jessi" should have her license revoked. I wont go into too much mud slinging here but im sorry when you need to bring your dog in 3x for tests, xrays you should expect to get somewhere with the treatment.  This doctor treated our dog for Heartworm, Kennel Cough and Valley Fever. She had NONE OF THEM.  She kindly charged us for blood tests etc for all of these ailments only to finally say "I don't know maybe you should take her to a specialist".  The specialist said she had a bone in her throat stuck and removed it.  BAD VETERINARIAN!!!

Ok take my review here with a grain of salt. I'm a total Spa nerd and have probably been to at least 100. That being said here we go.  Massage:    Very average massage. We went here on a Travelzoo day at the spa deal $99 person. The massage was quite average to bad. Its suppoed to be an hour, we got 45 mins. Of that 45 mins, 12 of them at least, were spent with the amssage therapist over at the sink doing god knows what. I asked for a Quad massage, they were never touched during the massage.  Mens Locker Room:  It's a gym locker room, not a SPA. It has a lot of locals hanging out and if you are into a nice quiet spa with amentities and a "spa feel" you won't find it here. The steamroom was nice, the relaxation room was an afterthought and odd, the hot tub is in a corner and completely ill placed. If you like privacy while you change, forget it. Everyone from the TV room can watch you change.   Horribly designed place.  POOL:  The actual spa pool is big enough for 2 people to do laps, Thats about it. So we used the resort pool just up the stairs. Went there for a couple of hours hoping to get drinks, no chance. No pool service.  Amentities: They had tea bags in the mens room with no hot water for it, no lemon waters or lime juices etc like most spas would have. Coffee but that was also empty. They have a jar of stale almonds in the TV room if you like that.  All in all this is one of the most disappointing Spas we have been to. Which is very sad because we had heard good things.  When we told the manager about our experience the reply was an offer of 25% off our next time in. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE COME BACK??  Oh well. Sanctuary Spa is officially the most overrated around.

Bomb.com   If you like Korean you will be very impressed with this place.  Pretty much everything we had here was absolutely fantastic as well as the service. Do not let the outside for you. This is a very nice restaurant inside.   Try the Dol Cet Bim Bim Bap with egg and a plate of spicy pork. Ask for the hot sauce and be prepared to enjoy the hell out of yourself.  Keep in mind these foods are all best when mixed together!!!

Pretty greasy Filipino food here. No real good flavors and all the food is made and then just kinda sits out all day on a hot table. Not even covered. Pretty unsanitary.  To be honest when we walked we were gonna walk out but the lady is very nice.  We ordered 2 combo plates to try 4 diff things. All 4 we agreed we would never want to eat again. The amount of grease in these foods was unreal. Def not normal for Flip food.

I have to concur with the other reviews of this place. Stay FAAAAR away from this place.  I literally had to call the cops to get them to give us our keys back and to put the wheels back on our car.  We went in for brake pads and were told we needed $800 worth of stuff done!!   We took the car elsewhere and the tab came to $220.

This place has gotten so popular and SOOO crowded it has become just way too hit or miss.  Last time I tried the Tuna and it was so overdone, so dry, I had to send it back. Traded it for a burger. The burger was the same way!  They need to get some quality control back so it gets back to where it once was.

Went today. Not very busy and still took about 15 mins to get 2 burgers and a shake. The reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing TRAINING so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles, lettuce etc, all the garnishments. That alone took a good 5 mins. Meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold. Also the fries.  Then they called us up, I alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with 2 employees hovering over it.  Burgers were cold, fries were cold. Had to send it all back. UNREAL!!!!  I have been to Joes at LEAST 20x since its in our neighborhood and our last 5 experiences have been HORRIBLE.  So disappointing. This place used to be great!

The lunch Buffet here is definately one of the best Indian Buffets in town.  The service is quite sterile and the Pakora is not nearly as good as at India Gate however.  The only thing missing from the buffet is Samosas! That would be great if they put small meat or veggie Samosas out.  Also we went towards the end of lunch. Bad idea to get there at that time. Typical for Indian restaurants they will not refresh the buffet unless the restaurant is full. I really wish they would not do that.  The Butter Chicken had no meat left in it so they took a bunch of meat off of the Tandoori chicken and added it in to the sauce. Then when the sauce ran out they added straight CREAM. This was all done in the kitchen of course but as a chef I know. Either way, not cool to do things like that in America.  Definately a solid 4 star place because their flavors are great. I won't give them the deserved 3 star this time for poor management due to the great flavors.

GREAT Indian Buffet. Definitely the best in town by a long shot. They charge for it though! $12 per person for lunch. The food is always fresh and good.   BEWARE: There is often a 10-15 min wait if you go during lunch time.

Wonderful place to stop in for lunch and great place to shop. This is my new favorite place to spend an hour on the weekend.   Try the buffalo ribs or pulled pork after they pull it out. Grab a half pound of each and sit at thier tables and enjoy. Awesomeness

Been here a few times now. Definitely fast becoming my favorite steakhouse.  Order the Bone in ANYTHING medium rare with the pepper crust and you won't be disappointed. The lobster mac and cheese is awesome. Not quite as good as Capital Grilles but damn good and def close.  The steaks are amazing. The service is acceptable for sure. The sides are also quite good. The ambiance is very hip and modern professional.  The cost is quite high so be ready for that. Steak runs about $55 and the Lobster mac is I believe $30 but big enough for 3 people to share for sure. Brussel Sprouts are great.   Parking kinda sucks. So valet, just don't make the mistake of going to the clubs or bars around Scottsdale and leaving your car at Valet here because they close at 10:30pm and you will have to Uber home. We did that and it was quite a shit sandwich of a situation.  I plan to hit this place a couple times a month, its that good. I'll probably alternate between it and Capital Grille. Capital is quieter and id say a bit more "fancy". City Hall is quite loud especially in the bar area so be prepared for that. It's def a place to be seen. For me its a place for a good biz meeting and to have a killer steak.  Oh and if you order anything WELL DONE, please go fuck yourself.

In my opinion Middle Eastern food that is of high quality is by far the hardest thing to find in this town.  I only came to this place because I saw another reviewer mentioned it in the same sentence as Haji Baba. To even talk about this place in the same sentence is an insult. Gyro meat was terrible and the Schwarma was totally dry.  If you want quality Middle Eastern food you have to go to Tempe or Scottsdale. Haji Baba or Byblos in Tempe or Mijana in Scottsdale.

The Good:  The Gyro Meat. Can't really knock this part. They have it down. Too bad they dont do their Shwarma on a spit as well.    The Bad: Pretty much everything else. The Shwarma was very dry, the Hummus was average at best, the "greek salad" was a bunch of cuccumbers and onlions diced up together.   We asked for some spicy sauce like Sriracha or something to kick up some flavors on the shwarma and they said no but they do have some pepper paste they would sell us for $1.  Too many better places with much better flavor profiles in the area. If you want quality and authentic look to places that are more middle eastern like HAji Baba, Mijana and Tasty Kabob

A barbershop is a place that a man can go to have a conversation and get a straight razor cut and shave should he so desire.  Well the conversation wasn't gonna happen because the folks here don't speak English. They were also all women.  Not sure of the hiring practice of this chain but they should start trying to hire people who speak English and perhaps even men. Since it's a barbershop.  Good cut by the young Mexican lady who cut my hair. However it was not a straight razor cut like I asked for. She confirmed yes when I asked her if she could cut it with a straight razor. Apparently the language barrier was too much.  For the price of the basic cut, Great clips or any other chain salon will be better because it's cheaper and virtually the same thing. I was in and out of the chair in 15 mins. Wasn't even asked if I wanted a shave.

Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur.   This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.  If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand.   Tiny servings.  The good. Friendly wait staff.  If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill.

This is really good Sushi but the 2 girls that work there (young white girls) are really quite bad. We have to ask for Refills on water constantly.   Forget trying to be flexible with your happy order order.   The Miso soup is pretty bland and the Edamame is hard to mess up but they have from time to time.  The owner guy is nice. He used to always give us a special dessert or something when we would come in. The last 4x he has barely even said hello.  The Las Vegas Rolls here are about the best ive ever had. Although, it's hit or miss. The tempura on the outside should taste like it was just fried.   Would be 4 star if they would clean their hallways to the bathroom.

They changed the wait staff. From the little blonde white girls to little Asian girls that are MUCH WORSE.   By far the worst service at any Restaurant you will find in Gilbert. Especially if you go at anytime where more than 4 tables are taken up.  No more special desserts, no more hellos from the owner, no more great sushi, they apparently lost their good Sushi Chef and the two guys working back there now are just too inconsistent. Sometimes you will get a decent roll but this last time, the Sushi was just falling apart all over the place.  Fried Vegas rolls, COLD. miso Soup flavorless, Bathroom and Hallways Disgusting.  BAD BAD BAD.   After coming here for 2yrs and probably 12x, we are done.

Overrated place. Great for Americans. It of you want real quality Indian food there is better to be had in Tempe. Nice atmosphere here but it's definitely in a bad neighborhood.  The bottom line was this place could be a bit closer to 4 stars if it were not for the super tiny portion size. They are really trying to keep people on a diet in this place.   It's no Kebab or India Gate in the quality dept IMO.

Pretty good for American Thai food. No spice available even when I asked for it Thai hot. They don't have Thai chilis. Thats a bummer.  The Gra Prao is not on the menu but any Thai restaurant should make it, so I ordered it and it was pretty bad. Very soupy, hardly any basil, no spice at all and that was asked for Thai hot.  Won't be back. For real Thai in this town, try Royal Thai Grill or Cha Da Thai. Those are still the 2 best authentic thai places we have found since actually being in Thailand.

Really good plate with a variety of meats. Basically fajita. The chorizo was the standout. As well as the chicken.  The things we thought were bland we're the Carnitas burrito and Blackened fish taco.  Shrimp tacos were great!

Night ruined.  Reservation was made 30 days in advance! The Chef acted like he was too good to spend time looking for our name. Simply looked at the book and said, no that name is not here.  Warning: Don't go here for any type of occasion or you might end up stuck with no dinner that night. Luckily Roaring Fork came through with an amazing meal as always.

This is average food, definitely average Pho.  Not sure where all the great reviews come from. It must be for the nice people working there. Nice until you start mixing their foods together to get some flavors going. Very bland! The girl for upset with me for mixing the foods and verbalized her frustrations. Can't say I've ever experienced that before.  The spicy wings were covered in like a sweet n sour sauce of some sort.  I'd skip this place. Much better Asian food at Beijing in a Chandler and if you like Viet you would want to go to Cyclo.

Trendy little place tucked away in a cute little neighborhood.   The food in the pics PROBABLY isn't available. Be aware of that. Most of the stuff we saw on yelp and went for was not available anyway.   Chicken and Waffle - It's good. The Waffle was a bit soggy though, the chicken was delicious. Would be nice if they gave you syrup. When we asked for it we were sneered at and told the waffle had it inside it but they would bring us some. The Green beans on the waffle were a weird addition but AWESOME.   Lobster Mac and Cheese - Meh. Lobster was dry and overcooked and the mac and cheese was stuff with breadcrumbs and far from creamy. This was definitely not something we would order again.    Flank Steak - Would have and could have been good would they not have sliced it as soon as it came off the grill. The juices just ran out all over the plate leaving the steak missing a lot of flavor and juicyness. These guys do not have a clue when it comes to proper steak prep. Id never order a steak here again. It had no flavor whatsoever.   All in all this place was a disappointment after a 23 mile drive to try it. The only decent thing was the chicken and waffles and to be honest, we would go to Lo Los and pay half the price if we ever craved it again.

This is hands down the best pizza I've had outside of New York city. I will say we have been here a few times now and the pizza is best when made by the heavyset guy who is always consistently there on Fridays and Saturdays.  Ask for the pie thin without a ton of crust. Always comes out perfect.  Skip the garlic knots as they have never been fresh and are really not very good. If you want good Garlic knots that are light and buttery only Gilbert Pizza has them in this town. But the pizza is better at Casanova.

Blah! Don't believe the hype. Not sure what people are thinking when they give this place 5 stars. Seriously, WTF!  The food was weird to all of us. Nothing really made sense. The flavors were just all over the place!   The servers in this place are seriously underwhelmed to be there. Not sure if they all just hate the management or what but they all seem really upset.  As e were getting close to leaving one server came over, grabbed our water bottle from the table that was 2/3 gone, then took it to another table and dropped it off! LOL. So gross.  Nothing here was great or even good for that matter. We tried it for Restaurant week and we def won't be back. It's a place that is trying to be something it's not. A bunch of 20somethings in the kitchen throwing things together that might look like fine cuisine but ultimately just ends up being some weird food.  Dishes tried: Baby squid, boar bacon, fish cake, chile soup, soft shelled crab

The worst.   God forbid you order off of the happy hour menu. Everything is prerolled precut and if you order it any of the burgers they are pre-frozen patties.  This place is truly awful. The only sushi place within 6 miles and they are taking huge advantage of it.   $10.75 for that tiny Vegas Roll? Really?? The eel sauce ha been sitting on it so long it was DRY!

We had a fairly simple Wedding at the Royal Palms. We knew we wanted top notch Wedding Photography and we heard from numerous people in the Snobsdale area that these guys were THE photographers if quality was the concern.  We naturally assumed they would be out of our price point but decided to call. Pleasantly surprised they were located in the far East Side of town close to us so that worked out great to go meet them.  We did and we worked out what we found to be a very reasonable package for a local Wedding, considering the quality of the work.  We could not have been happier with the quality of service of the photographers, the more than amazing images and the professionalism and creativity of both of the photographers.   When you hire a photographer you should base the feedback on the images. That is what i'm doing. 5 star. The rest just happened to be great as well.

The upsells and then the lack of follow through to provide what we were just upsold lands this place a 2 star.  $15 car wash should mean that I don't have to walk around my car and point out 3 places that there is still MUD on my truck!  Unreal. Sorry but people need to step it up and start putting it on these giant chain places and make them provide better service.  By the way, I paid for the undercarriage wash as well. I forgot to check that part out. Big mistake. They didn't even do it. Of course I was 8 miles away before I figured that part out.

Absolutely amazing Steak Frites! That dish is wonderfully done.   First order was the braised short ribs. Although it was OK, we sent it back for another Steak Frites because it just wasn't nearly as good.  Will definitely be back. Also to note, the portion sizes of different dishes are all varying. Order the Steak Frites if you want to feel like you had enough to eat.

Tried it again. Last time. The food is just off and the service is just way too slow.   Tried speaking Thai to the owner and he ignored me.  Thai hot food should be HOT. Especially when you ask for it hot! When you ask for a side of Thai chili and they give you Jalapeños in Fish sauce they are just taking short cuts.  No more.

Not sure which place all these people were reviewing. The burger had very little flavor compared to In n Out, Chuckbox or Freddy's.   The fries are Ore Ida. So not sure why so much stink over them. Kinda mushy.  The special sauce was not very good tasting. Maybe we hit them on a bad day? Who knows. Probably won't be back though.

Some really outstanding flavors and experimental cuisine here. The menu changes frequently so don't bother trying to look at the one on their site. That part is a bit frustrating.  Keep in mind entrees for dinner run $25-35 but the appetizers are all in the $12-15 range. We tend to just order the apps and get a few of them. They are usually quite excellent and they do great things with veggies and creams.  The only downside for us is the unnecessarily pretentious Tattoos man that waits on everyone. Every question you ask him, you will be made to feel like an idiot. He truly thinks you should just shut up and order. I believe his name was Pavle.  I'd probably give this place more stars but the entire table agreed we just weren't liking the main persons attitude so they can take our 2 stars and our $200 and suck it. Suck it hard. Maybe if they get rid of Mr Knowitall we will be back.

It's no Kathys Rum Cake unfortunately. Not sure what they did or where they went wrong but they definitely went wrong.  The cake itself was very dry, the creams and fruit parts were fine, except the bananas. Which were WAY too ripe and brown to go in a cake. Almost sour.  We have been going to Cathys for over a decade and won't be continuing on with Lisa's now that Cathy is gone. You're seriously better off just going to Costco or Sams Club now. Their cakes taste better. Especially considering how insanely priced Lisas is.

Great Pizza for AZ and for the price.  You are definiately in for a treat with the pie at this place. Especially the Sicilian Slices! It's top notch.  Can't believe some of the poor reviews of this place. Must have gone on bad days.  Here is what not to order IMO:  WING. We did not care for them at all.  The pizza is great and we recommend you get slices. Try the Sicilian as well as the Napolitano.  Other than the old man making the pizzas, the rest of the staff never seems to know whats going on. To their defense its usually just kids. Good pizza joint. They could use more TV's and a Beer license.

The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.  When returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.  Unprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.

Some of the most Bland Indian food in town.   i eat Indian about once a week and would consider myself an "Indian Buffet guru". This Buffet is more than sub par with very awkward stand right by the table and stare at you type service.   Bad. Pass. If you want better in this area try Guru Palace. But even still that place is not amazing either.

Absolutely the worst service!!  We weren't very hungry. We just wanted to share a Paella. She basically starts trying to force us to get a sampler. The up selling was ridiculous.  When our food came they came and dropped off all this food we did not order. 10 mins later the waitress came and we told her we didn't order it. She said yes we did and got pissed at us!!! Grabbed the food and finally came back with our paella 30 mins later.

This is an alternative lifestyle bar that is very couples friendly. Will definately go back. The food I would say was average to slightly above average also.  Very good drink specials also.

Im a steak snob so I take leaving a review above 3 stars for any steakhouse a tough thing to do. This place earned it!  Asked for a bone in ribeye (of course), asked for it heavily peppered and salted before cooking and that they would give it a good char. VOILA! It came out great!  What was not good was that the other party made the mistake of ordering the chicken, it was dry and needed to be sent back. It came back out, equally as dry.   Stick to the steaks here, the ribs are also quite good. We sat on the patio and had acceptable service.   Oh yea get the loaded baked potato.  HIRE MIDGETS AND THIS PLACE WOULD BE SUPER COOL. JUST SAYIN

Hit this again and orderd a Peppercorn Crusted Ribeye. It was perfection!!  The double cut porkchop was excellent as well. We sit at the bar when we go. Good service always. Good house wine for Happy Hour as well.   This is a solid spot!  The bald guy that works the door area can def be a wanker like someone previously stated. The bigger guy from Compton that works behind the bar can also be a bit college locker roomish for a nice restaurant.

Wow what a bummer!! We used to really love this place and would take people here all the time.  This last time the owner really dropped the ball by super inappropriately handling a situation, embarrassing our table and being confrontational over how a steak was cooked!  Bottom line is 4 dinners ordered, 2 steaks came in beyond rare, blue rare we will call it. Sent them back and assumed they would fire new steaks like most decent steakhouses would. They did not. They retired the same steaks (which had mushroom sauces all over them) and burnt them. They tasted like ass. So we told the waitress the deal, she went and talked to the owner and came back and said "the owner is taking care of your meal and a new one will be out". Cool. No problem, things happen.  Out comes a perfect steak but unfortunately everyone was done eating. Took a few bites and put it in the to go box. We all know how awesome a reheated bone in ribeye is. Not.  Bill comes. Nothing taken off. Even charged more to add peopercorns to the steak!   Told the waitress. She got the manager, Mandi. Who was about as helpful as boobs on a log. She literally said to us "I came over because the owner doesn't like to deal with these situations and talk to people directly". LOL! Wow. Ok Mandi, just take this off our bill. She couldn't and had to get the owner. This is where it got stupid.  Owner comes over and is confrontational. Says the first steak should have been perfect since it was medium rare. Everyone at the table agreed it was rare beyond belief and cold in the middle! We weren't gonna agree so avoid having an argument with the owner on a Saturday evening!   I just said "look I wouldn't have waited to eat after everyone else did if the server didn't tell me you were taking care of it". Then he told me basically why should I buy your steak if it finally came out great at the end. Uh....because you're in the f'n service industry jackass and I send people here all the time and live in the neighborhood. The whole table couldn't believe it.  They literally took the to go container we had with various leftovers, removed the Offending Ribeye in question and then gave it back and removed it from the tab. No apology, nothing.  Tip for the owner: Look up "cost of doing business" you lost 4 regulars last night that spend $300 each in your bars on a regular basis each month. Over a $10 food cost. As a business owner myself I think you're a damned idiot.  Will be back, once, to use this groupon. Then we will start trying other places. If it's amazing the way it used to be next time I will put the review back how it was.

Fairly straight forward transaction. Once they completed the job they raised the price $30 for various wiring rather than asking if I was ok with that. That is the only reason that they get docked a star.  Other than that, great service and a good job.  Great guys!

Staff just has no personality nor desire to chat.   Pizza is some of the most poorly made and inconsistent pizza I've tried. Pass. If you do want good pizza in Gilbert there are other places like Venezias and Cassanova Bros that make a real decent pizza.  No guy named Geno even works there. Just a bunch of personalityless young Mormon kids who know nothing about pizza or how to treat customers so they will come back.

1hr wait for our food after we got a seat.  Nice scenery and awesome vibe. That's were it ends.  The Blueberry muffins was unbeatable and dry.  The biscuits and gravy was pretty dang good. Should come with sausage or bacon though.  The Carne asada burrito was pretty bland.  The sandwich made out of French toast was the best thing and it was decent at best.  We will be back to the Perch but not here.

I get a cheeseburger with Jalapeños and Bacon. That's how I roll. These guys do It well.   This place is better than In n Out but not as good as Freddys. All in all, very good!   Not a fan of the fries or the fact they don't grill the Jalapeños.

I have to be honest the chicken Parmesan here in the spaghetti and meatballs was actually very good.  I know this place is been around for decades but I have never tried it. I will definitely come back as the prices were very fair and the sauces are very good. Not to mention to Brett that they brought out was still steaming and excellent.

Meh...it's pretty decent food and all but there is better to be had in this area. The people were fairly friendly but could care less about being very personable and having a conversation.  The biggest issue with this place was how disgusting the bathroom was. Made me with I hadn't  closed the door behind me! So gross. Hasn't been cleaned in at least a year or two. I can imagine the kitchen!

Look. I hate to admit I even go to buffets from time to time but this is actually a pretty decent Chinese buffet.  The employees were all very friendly and they were very attentive, the food was actually very flavorful and very good, it has Mongolian barbecue and a sushi station.  The upside to this buffet is that you can eat as healthy or as bad as you would like. For a Chinese buffet in a marginal area of town is actually remarkably very clean. It is definitely worth checking out. There's no way to give a buffet five stars so this will get a solid four star from me. When you take into consideration the price you really can't beat it.  Sidenote; I went there at 3 PM on a weekday.

I don't get this place. The food completely lacks seasoning and flavor. Highly overpriced and they charge you $1 per drink to drink YOUR own drinks you bring! Then $7 per bottle for wine.  Skip this place. It does not deserve the high marks.   The food comes out raw and then you cook it yourself in 2 different pots of boiling water. One dark, one light. Neither had any flavor.  Good luck trying to get any service either. Our water glasses sat empty pretty much the entire time we were there.

Had a very  bad experience here.  First off, many of the photos posted on Yelp don't actually exist on the menu. They are from some catering company which you will not be able to order from.  We ended up getting a wrap, Thai ribs and  a chicken salad.  The food was all tasteless and bland. I wanted to ask for my money back and walk out. However the group that I was with felt very awkward doing that but they agreed.   I will never be back to this place. Very disappointed in this place because I wanted to try for such a long time.

Wow. We must have went on a bad day or something. Burnt popcorn, tasteless food in super super tiny portions.  Majorly bummed on this place. We drove 40 miles to try it. Waste of gas. Guess thats what we get for going on a weekday afternoon.  We did like our server though.

Waited until we tried this place 4x before leaving this review.  1st time: Excellent. Bread a bit dry but other than that, excellent Cheeseteak and Fries.  2nd time: Horrible. Very dry Bread. Worst Rueben we have ever had.  3rd time: Corn beef sandwich was like eating cardboard, Cheesesteak was good but the bread was dry  4th time: Horrible. Tried their Parmesean and Garlic wings, had no taste at all. Tasted like just Chicken wings fried and served. Not even any salt. PASS! Cheesesteak was dry and the meat was overcooked. Tried the Rueben again. 2 tiny slices of Pastrami between 2 dry pieces of bread.  This place has SERIOUS consistency issues. Which is not surprising because they also have a pizza joint by the same name which has great thin NY style slices if you go during the day but if you order a Large pizza it is god awful and doughy.

EXTREMELY overpriced. $21-23 per plate. Tiny portion sizes.  The food quality is OK, about on par with Olive Garden if you are into that type of quality.  They touted fresh made pastas when we entered. When we ordered the Spagetti side dish was definitely not fresh made. The Canneloni was.   The Escargot which was highly spoken up by the owner was absolutely horrible. Definitely had been reheated and rather than swimming in butter it was swimming in a luke warm lemon water with spinach. GROSS!!!!  Service was average. Nice enough staff. The plates at this place should be $8-14 at most. They are dreaming thinking they can keep charging these prices with the tiny little portion sizes they offer.

This review is mostly due to the absolutely horrible attitude our table was given and the horrible service by the server named Emma.  Why in the world they would have someone so miserable working there is beyond me.  The food won't even get a review. We couldn't get past the fact we wet treated as a huge inconvenience to our server.

Dropping the review down here due to lack of service and lack of flavors.  Sat our group of white folks down and we were the only white people in there. Took about 10 mins before anyone that worked there even acknowledged us. The entire restaurant was chinese people.  The young guy who is the waiter came over and just slapped some menus down and then brought us glasses of luke warm water.  We tried the Kung Pao and the Cumin Beef this time around. Neither was anything to write home about at all. Both needed a lot of soy sauce and sriracha for any flavoring.  We will skip this place and go to the Magic Noodle House from now.

For me the worst part about this gym was the jiu jitsu instructor Andre. Is unnecessarily abrasive and harsh for a family jujitsu center. He acts like he is back in Rio or something and his entire attitude is not needed.  There are many other great jiu jitsu schools in town that have instructors that are positive and pleasant.  Also you should be able to get unlimited training in this town for around $100. Anything more than that and you are paying way too much. These guys are a little out of line with their pricing considering the demographic in incomes in a town like this.

Amazeballs!!!!  This is not just some of the best barbecue in Arizona this is some of the best barbecue in the country. These people know what's up. Moist brisket and the spareribs will blow your mind. Not to mention the fact that they carry beef ribs! That's amazing  The place is def a dump however and seating is fairly limited. They need one of these on the East Side!  DOWNSIDE: CRAZY EXPENSIVE considering they are in a bad neighborhood and their rent is probably nothing. They are def proud of their BBQ to charge what they do for it.

Good guys. Fixed my kids AC in her Acura and the whole thing was zero hassle and a good experience. Seem like some solid guys.  They also did her front brakes. Cost a bit more than Just Brakes but didn't have to deal with the shady upsells.  Charlie works the counter and Wes I believe is the owner. Solid dudes.

Take this review with a grain of salt as I'm a BBQ buff.  This is very very average BBQ that is being prepared in a very generic and lazy way.   This is the type of BBQ establishment run by a 20something who watches a lot of BBQ shows on cable and decided to open a small restaurant. Which is fine. However great BBQ this is not. The flavor profiles are all over the place for all categories of the food and it ends up making the food taste just weird and like chemicals and Hickory.  The Brisket lacks seasoning and has too much smoke and not enough tenderness. The ribs have a tough "skin" on them which makes them extremely hard to chew. They are also cheap St Louis style ribs that are extremely fatty.  The place is a health hazard as well, take a quick trip to the bathroom and you will see that.  My advice to them: use waaay less Hickory and start using more flavorful and less pungent woods.  If you want great BBQ in Phx try any of the following and spend your money where it deserves to be spent in order of best first: Texas BBQ House, BBQ Company, Rudy's

Being from NY we were pretty stoked to find this place and had high hopes. Spent a good amount of time talking with the lady that owns it. Very nice.  Sadly the cupcakes were hard and the frosting used on them tasted like it had chunks of sugar in it and was baked by a 10yr old.  The Biscotti Cookies had an incredibly high amount of liquor flavor to them, too much so and they were not good.  Don't bothering ordering your cupcakes to go because they have no proper packaging to put them in.  Disappointed.

I found the Brisket here to be fantastic. The pulled pork was very good. We tried to order a bit of everything but they were out of ribs.  The only thing that was NOT good. Chicken. It was definitely dry which is not good considering it was dark meat.  We plan to try again tonight and will be ordering the Brisket FOR SURE

Cool spot!   The GOOD  Amazing selection of beers  Decent deals for micro pitchers  AWESOME Arizona Burger  Good location    The BAD  Horrible Beef Brisket Sandwich - sent it back. It was just super DRY. Maybe just an off day.  Flatbread pizzas are decent at best. Everything just slides right off it because the saice is too watery.  NOISE- This place very badly needs to install some sound diffusers on the ceiling. There was a table of 6 drunk and laughing girls at the other side of the restaurant and we were blown away by how the sound carried. In a concrete place like this they need sound panels.

Mold on their Dessert. That's about all I needed to see. Unfortunately that was after eating the buffet. Which wasn't terrible but I can only imagine what the health inspector would find in the back.  It's a 3 star Chinese Buffett but the Mold gives it a 1.  Mold can f'n kill you!!   I brought it to the attention of the manager and in true Chinese fashion he offered me 10% off of my $7.99 bill. LOL

Lame.  $6 for small beers anywhere you go.  Most of the food plates at most of these trucks are $4-$8  The whole thing is just kinda cheesy and not held in a great location. Would be much better if held in Civic Plaza or downtown Chandler or Gilbert. This just feels like a great big money grab.

Came once and it was great in January. Came today and it was all dry. We both did big combo plates and pretty much everything was dry.  Shady black dude behind the counter kept flirting with the wife too. Tacky.  Pass on this place and the place next door which is also quite bad.  2 worth BBQ joints in Phoenix:  #1 - Texas BBQ House  #2 - Little Miss

Very good.   The good: The food quality is top shelf. Made to order. The owner couldn't be nicer, which is rare in Indo/Pakistani places sometimes.   The bad: Small restuarant thrown together on a shoestring budget, the strip center where it is located is kinda dead and somber. The NAan is the only dish that is definitely below average for the food. The food is so good it deserves a nice thin garlicy Naan bread and not that thick pizza dough type they are serving with it.  We will definitely be back.   Note: The buffet, is not a you serve yourself kind, she brings you a fresh sampler platter as you request it and it's great!

Very bland food. They need to incorporate some good flavors like spices and maybe even a good salt in their cooking.   The desserts are the best thing to order here. They are made by a 3rd party company and brought in. By far the best thing about the place.  Whatever you do, when you're ordering, don't look at the floor of the kitchen or the cooking area. Trust me.

Decent flavors but these guys don't know the basics of Brisket.  A couple things.  1. im a Brisket nerd and a BBQ Guru. I know how to smoke it and know how it should be smoked whether using Pellet or real wood. These guys use Pellet.  2. The Brisket was tough, it should be springy when you pull i apart. This was not. Which means they cooked it too long or too fast typically.   If you are a Brisket fanatic like me you need to try The Pork Shop in Queen Creek. By far the best Brisket in AZ. If you want a good happy hour and some decent pulled pork tacos and cheap beer, try Porkopolis. Just don't go there expecting awesome Brisket and you will be happy.

Ok gave this place another shot. Picked up 1lb of Brisket at 6pm on a Friday night. I assumed they would have the fresh brisket out and ready to roll.  Drive home (15mins) opened up the brisket for me and the hubby and it was by far the most dry and overcooked Brisket we have ever had!!!! My hubby is a bIGTIME BBQ nut and he said this Briaket had easily been sitting since the morning.  Why would you serve this to people and charge them this much!?!  Anyone can do Pulled pork. It can sit out for MANY hours and still taste good. Brisket, not so much.  Bummed.

That was some damn fine Fish Tacos and Shrimp Burrito.  We always pass this place and assumed it would be like a Del Taco but it's not. Top quality stuff here. Huge Burritos! Loved it.  The only thing they need is something spicy. It's just gringo spicy right now, some of us Gringos want REAL spicy.   You guys should add a Habanero salsa or something as an option ;)  Great grub.

Bomb burritos and Mimosas!  Also had the Torta which was pretty good as well. no complaints on this spot. Wasn't busy at all, we were pretty much the only ones there on a Sunday morning. Started picking up by the time we left though.  Definitely try the Breakfast Burritos!

Stop what you're doing!!!!!  If you are the type of person that only reads the 5 star reviews then you get what you deserve. Like we did on this one. Should have went more with the Google reviews which had it closer to 3 stars.  Not sure what they are thinking here with all these flavors and weird dishes but they don't work!  Add chopped onions to the Mac and cheese? Why?  Huge pieces of Lemon Peel on top of the Short Rib? Why??  Deconstructed Lobster Bisque? Weird and no one seemed to be a fan.  At the end of the day you just have to ask yourself if you'd order any of the things you've ordered, again. The answer was a resounding NO.  Even the mixed drinks were weird.  Not to mention the prices. Just retarded

Great atmosphere.  Great service.  Great music.   Horrible food. =/  Majorly bummed since this is a newer neighborhood restaurant. Had high hopes for it being great. The food sounds like its gonna be great but it just fails. Tastes as though the chef might be young and experimenting with creative bar food but it ends up being just too much of something or another. Too tart, too salty, too much fruit flavoring on the porn wings, Hoison wings that taste like a salt lick.  Bummed out on this review. Wanted to love this place!

Ya know this place is really fun. We have come here a handful of times now and other than the food this is a great place to drink. The food is still quite bad in all regards.  Also if you go during the day it's definitely a GAY BAR. They leave the hot waitresses at home all day gifts apparently and it's just guys catering to 90% gay men. Still a cool place. Me and the spouse really don't mind at all. Good happy Hour!  Here's the thing that bugs me as well. Come here at 3 on a weekday and it's packed. 1 bartender, 1 manager (Mike), it will take you absolutely forever to get a drink because the Manager will go sit in the back the entire time while the bartender waits on the entire restaurant! There was literally 25 people in the bar, 12 at the bar and the rest at tables. 1 bartender!  Absurd.

Ya know these people are a real nice family from PA. They apparently owned this restaurant there for 30+ years before moving here.  Is it the best soul food? No. However I'd definitely come back at some point. Here are the pros and cons  Pros:  Mac and cheese Fried Chicken (overall good but needs some seasoning..kinda bland) The folks (just nice people) Sweet Potato Pie   The cons:  The place is filthy. Cobwebs etc all over, dirty floors and tables  Lack of spice in chicken  Catfish was real plain and had no real flavor either  Pricey. $25 for an 8 piece with a couple sides   This is a good option if you are in this part of town and need soul food and don't want to drive all the way to Lo Lo's. I have to give Lolo the edge in the flavor dept however.   If these guys would add a tiny bit of Cayenne and garlic and maybe a little salt to their batter it would be the best in town.

Cold food at 11:45 buffet. Will never go back.  Watery as hell Tikka Masala and butter chicken.if you're used to the chandler location this one is nothing like it. Different recipes altogether.  Skip this is you like Real Indian food.  Might change my review if they actually invited me back for some HOT food. Im upset I did not leave.

This place deserves a really solid 4 star. Just alone for the killer happy hour and amazing Date Night deal for Thursday nights.  $39 for 2 people to dine and the amazing pork chop is on the menu. Good deal!  The service is fairly sterile but the ambiance is great and the food was quality.  Loved: Wedge Salad, Chop, Grilled artichokes, Ice Cream sandwich dessert, Ribs  Went again: Salmon was amazing, Steak Kabobs. All wonderful. Did not LOVE the Pecan tart but still not bad.

arrrgghh!!! I hate when a great restaurant takes a dive!!  Let's see, we haven't gone in 2 months and here is everywhere they now drop the ball.  The bartenders: They were great and friendly guys who would talk and chat it up with me and the Mrs. No longer. They actually hired the girl from CHAO up the street that was the reason we didn't go there! She's horrible and has a terrible permanent bitchface. Not sure of her name, tattooed Asian girl. We will just call her Miss Attitude.   The food special: No more Thursday night datenight?? Are you kidding? We must have sent 40 people there and turned them onto this restaurant for that special. No more.   The food prep. Terrible. The ribs were super dry when we went on Oct 21nd. The burgers were overcooked and the fries were ultra soggy.   Won't be going back for awhile if ever. Which sucks because we live right behind it. Time to explore other avenues.

The doctor is good. It's all downhill from there!!  The doc was Carter. He was professional and is a good surgeon. He has been in the game for a very long time. The downside is he is a teaching doctor and always has another doctor shadowing him. I believe that as a patient you should be asked if you mind this. Personally I do. I'd prefer some one on one with my surgeon.  The downhill to this place is their MRI staff!! Namely the schedulers and front desk folks. Ledi I believe her name was. Insanely rude! To the point I had to ask another patient "did you find the girl at the front to be rude"? His response "incredibly rude".  Not sure why a company needs to have a person like this be a scheduler. It's just nuts. You should have people skills doing this job.  I won't be using these folks for my should surgery. I'll be taking my MRI results elsewhere for the surgery. I can only imagine what the follow ups are gonna be like here.   Pass.

Used to be SOOOOO good when they were in their old location. Had a certain personable feel, you could go in and talk with Ryan and his sister and just enjoy yourself.  Now it always seems to be run by kids who have no clue what they are doing. Serving up some super burnt ribs and dry as hell brisket. No love!!  Sad review for me to post because I was with these guys in spirti when they first opened their doors. The new location def robbed them of something.  That being said, the chicken is still some of the best in the valley. The ribs and brisket def are falling short.

More like Passage to GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK MUTHA MUTHA!!  Listen to me people. Im an Indian Food snob. This is average Indian food at the very best. If you're in the Tempe area you can do MUUUUUCH better with a place like Kebab Palace, India Gate or even The Dhaba.  This place has a great location but it looks like some friends took what was in there garage, found a used hot food table on craigslist and stuck it in a corner of the restaurant.  Tandoori chicken that tasted boiled and had literally no flavor.   Dry NAAN  The Chicken Tikka Masala was decent  Vegatable Pakora that was cold, along with most other dishes.  No salt, no pepper available and lastly and most irritaingly, not spicy at all!  Skip it and save your money.  THE SUCK!!!!

Pretty bomb!! Total dive in a marginal area.  It's basically a Subway but Mediterranean style food and you make it into the bowl you want. It's solid.  Skip their Gluten Free  cupcakes. Those were terrible.  When you're done grab a Donut at the Donut Co in the same parking lot. Apple Fritter donuts to die for.  Will be back

First let me say im former US Army Infantry.  The guys here are just super over the top. All acting like they are about to head into combat and couldn't be more uptight. Bullet Proof vests and everyone has a sidearm. WHY?  We went all the way down there to shoot at 5pm on a Thursday night only to be told we should have called first because the whole place was rented by some corporation.  Ok so we decided to do some shopping. The selection of accessories is pretty bad here. They literally had 2 scopes.  Trying to get the guys to be cool was a bit of a task, they all act like on duty police officers or bouncers. Not a fan of this at a gun range!!! Get over yourselves.  The only upside I saw was the pricing on their box ammunition. Decent prices.  Tried to look at a couple guns, 10 mins after standing there i managed to get a guy to help me. Asked to see an M&P Shield "sorry dont have it". Asked to see a Sig P938 "sorry don't have it".   Left.   Another couple asked if we wanted to go shooting a week later and said they want to check it out. I said fine, go ahead and see when their ladies night is. NO LADIES NIGHT.   PASS!!!  We will keep going to Caswells, Teds or Shooters World. The staff is down to earth.

Come here for the French Fries. Everything else was waaaaay too experimental in its flavors.   Tart BBQ Ribs and Yogurt Foam? REALLY? No thank you!  This chef is known for getting some horrible feedback for trying to do weird things with food. It doesn't work IMO.

Horrible risotto balls. No flavor at all. Sevice was sterile.   Dead flowers on the table. Why?  Pizza was odd tasting and chewy.   All the good table were open and they said they were all "reserved". Lame to say that to a customer at 4:30pm on a Friday. By the time we left, all those tables were still open.   This earned them a 1 star. You have to learn how to treat people!!

Really really good!  Fresh food, relaxed and modern atmosphere, cool employees, amazing ingredients and flavors.  The prices are reasonable as well.  Can't really knock this place for anything. Good appetizers and amazing entrees. We had the Hummus Nachos and Chicken Pita. Add bacon!  Delicious!

Tried the 2 things most recommended by the girl who answered.  Pizza and some Pastrami sandwich.  The pizza was doughy and very bland and the sandwich was stuffed full of dy pastrami on what tasted like stale bread.  This is last resort food at its finest. I hear the wings are good, maybe thats the only thing worth getting.

Dr. Veena Khunkhun is a very nice lady that does a very good job of making a horrible situation as easy as possible.  She came to euthanize our vey old dog and showed up at the scheduled time. She showed up with an assistant that was very nice.  LIKES: She doesnt ask you for more money to "sedate" your dog. Nor should any vet that does euthanasia. Its inhumane to think about not sedating a dog first.  She is very pleasant.  Her assistant is very pleasant.  Her price was fair. As fair as 30 mins of "work" could be i suppose.  DISLIKES:  I found it distasteful when the whole family is laying on the floor with the pet that is soon departing to ask for the check. Finance issues should really be taken care of via phone in situations like this or the day prior. Its just, tacky.  She does not deliver the ashes back from the crematorium. This is something that some in home pet euthanasia docs do offer and we personally would have preferred that.

nO NO nO NO nO  I bet you thought that read ho no oh no oh no huh? The mind is weird.  This place has very poor service and charges a lot for food that is very much lacking. The service though is what really killed it. They gave us 1 server for 12 people! WTF?   The Lambshank was pretty good though.  That being said there is absolutely no reason to go to a place like this in a town full of amazing restaurants that have decent service and actually care that you are there.

Really good New Mexican food!   The only downside I can really point out here is that they don't have the really hot Green Chile from Hatch. They have what we consider the "White People Hot" which is pretty much medium.  They should have an XX spicy chile available at all times for people at a real New Mexican Restaurant.  The owner was nice, she stopped by to see how we are doing. Very pleasant. Service was great in the bar area.  It was super packed by 5:30pm.  Is it Richardsons good? No. It's more on par with a nicer sit down version of NEw Mexican Grill . Now I don't have to drive all the way to Richardsons for a nice sit down NM meal.

This is by far the worst Indian food and the worst service in town.  This is Indian food for white people I have no idea what Indian food is supposed to taste like.  There is no spices and no flavor whatsoever.  The buffet is not even worth the eight dollars they charge for it. They bring out the naan at the end of the meal. What is that about?  I asked for peppers or something to add some spice to the food and they did not have it. The tandoori chicken was tasting like it was yesterday's and was extremely dry and Burt. There is absolutely no reason for this buffet to the existing. Closet it down already!

Excellent Thai!!!  Not to mention the only Thai place in AS I've ever seen that serves Thai Boat soup! This blows Pho away. Trust me, just try it.   Suggestion: boat soup, pad kapow Thai style

This place was great. Awesome modern feel and super friendly service.   The chop salad was amazing as was the grits with brussel sprouts. REALLY great.  We also had the Pastrami hash and it was also fantastic, a little light on the pastrami and heavy on the hash would be my only nitpick there.  Will def be back for the Brussel Sprouts and Salad!

Come here for the Atmosphere and the outstanding service. The food unfortunately left us all kinda flat. The chef here needs to work more with flavors.  If you came back when T-cooks had another chef things have definitely changed. That amazing Paella is also gone. Although we only at the the Mix Up bar and not T-Cooks, we looked at the menu. Didn't do much for us.  We had the Burger, Pannini and Lobster Corn Dog. The corndog was by far the best thing. The burger was much too lacking in flavor considering how messy it was. The Pannini was dry and you can get better at any Paradise Bakery.  My prediction is this chef lasts 1 year.

Solid!!  This is a pretty no frills place that isn't very fancy and for the most part could be a Denny's with Sushi but the Sushi is top notch.   Really reasonable as well. Especially for happy hour.  Things I loved: vegas rolls, spicy tuna, unagi, stuffed mushrooms  Thing I probably wouldn't get again: gyoza, tootsie roll   I think I've found my new favorite happy hour sushi place

This is good pizza. Quit going for all that bullshit Pizza Hut and Dominos and open your hearts and mouths.   To you folks from Chicago, is this Lou Malnatis? Nope. Not nearly spicy enough sausage and the use crumbled sausage and not the patty but it's as close as you will get in AZ!  Get the butter Crust Deep Dish, its not on their menu but ask for it. Why they left it off the menu I have no idea. Get it loaded with MEAT. If you go with the Vegetarian pizza just get it with meat still and quit being stupid.   ::::DONT CALL MIDGETS MIDGETS. THE PREFERRED NOMENCLATURE IS LITTLE PEOPLE.:::: now back to the story   The beer deals here are great and much appreciated. Thanks Buddy! z?  The service is flat and sterile like most of the people in this part of Phoenix. So just go with it. The atmosphere is like Motzah Ball soup, very bland.  have fun

Pretty good breakfast burritos but everything else kinda left us flat.  The Carne Asada is good but the burritos are so full of rice, potatoes, beans etc that you won't hardly taste it.  For a $7 burrito they should be looking way more like Filibertos.   I probably won't be back.

My new favorite place in town.  If you like the following this is the place for you:  Seafood Butter Flavors SPICE!   Quite simply put, this is a great experience and a great little restaurant.  Definitely get the Shrimp, potatoes and Sausage! Plus whatever other seafood you might like  This place is THE BOMB

This is really good BBQ. Is it the best in Phoenix? NO. But it's DAAAAMN good.   The Good:   Brisket done right  Awesome Mustard BBQ sauce  Grits as a side  Great Pulled Pork  Friendly owner and Staff   The BAD:  The Ribs. Not great. Better than a place like Rudys but can't touch a place like Texas BBQ House  The Wait- 30 min standing in line in 105 degree weather. Not fun. Thats 10 mins after they open.  The price. This is probably the most expensive BBQ in town. $17lb for Brisket? Holy crap.  The regular Sauce  All in all a really great BBQ place that is the only thing that has come close to touching Texas BBQ House. I would say their Brisket is def on par, their Pulled Pork is better and their Ribs are not even close. TBH will still be the go to. Then this place.  In order of best BBQ in town....well.....there are only 2 worth a dang as far as im concerned  1. Texas BBQ House 2. Little Miss BBQ 3.......meh......I guess Rudys but only for everything other than Ribs.

This place is a super special treat. Not a place you'd want to go every day or every week for that matter because it's just so bad for you but it's amazing.  Nothing like a hot donut that has that slightly crisp outside and a nice topping. So delicious.   Less is more as far as flavoring a go. You can go overboard here.

This is simply horrible barbecue. They actually should not even tell people that they barbecue here because they just cook ribs and things in the oven and give you a whole bunch of sauce to cover it with.  I would highly recommend avoiding this place if you're looking for serious BBQ. I have heard that their sandwiches are decent

Terrible.  Everything from the service on New Years eve to the food choices.  This place was good when it was Cork and had a great happy hour. As for its New Years dining experience which they charged $75 per person for it was horrible.  Horrible server. The worst Cake ever, everyone at the table sent it back. It was overcooked and dry and tasted like something purchased at a 3day old mexican bakery.  The fish was the only thing anyone liked to be honest. The short rib dish was horrible and definitely NOT worth the $75 per person price of admission.  Not once did the waiter apologize for anything at all, not even a single dish that was sent back. He looked extremely coked out actually.

It's not great. I'm mostly leaving this review to remind my wife to stop buying groupons for it.  The tempura shrimp they use in their rolls is pre fried. Fried hours and hours before using it! That's a bad sign. It's all downhill from there.  Worst Vegas roll in town. Pretty decent egg rolls though!  Go here for the egg rolls.

Outstanding for the price!!!  This is basically Chipotle but Mediterranean food. It's good, it's fresh, the PB sauce is basically the same Garlic Mayo type sauce that they have over at Haji Baba (the best in the state).   For $7.95 you build your own bowl and its enough to keep you full for a day. Great food. I hope they open one of these in Chandler.

Probably the best Thai food in the area. Actually very good.  I would highly recommend the order things ties style here if possible and get the heat kicked up because they know how to do it right.  The old lady cooking in the kitchen is very authentic. The guy working the front area is pretty bad and really shouldn't be working in a restaurant. You get kid, maybe 22yrs old.   The wait was pretty crazy considering there were only 4 other tables taken in the restaurant.  The Pork Gra Prao was awesome as was the red Curry dish. The amount of Veggies in their dishes is a bit much and there was only 2 shrimp in the Shrimp Pad Thai.  If you want a bit nicer place than Thai Paradise this is the place. Food almost as good with some less authentic option on the menu.

Wow this place really fell off.  The pad Thai was sweet and really dry. Pad Thai is not something I would usually order but it supposed to be good here. It basically tasted like noodles in a tomato sauce. Not good!  Then we ordered a Basil Chicken (Gra Prao) Thai style and they didn't understand we wanted it ground and with a fried egg. It came out just ok but had such a small amount of chicken everyone made comments about it. Lots of veggies, no real meat. Bad dish for that type of thing.  We won't be back. There are better Thai places around.

I really hate to leave this review since I've been dying to try this place and it's right in my neighborhood.   I came in about two hours before they closed and asked for what the most popular thing was. The girl told me definitely a chicken Parmesan sandwich. I said great let's do it.  She asked what kind of bread and I told her that I heard Karlos bread was great. She said they did not have it. I asked for the next best thing and they made it on that bread.   The chicken was insanely dry, there was hardly any sauce or cheese on the sandwich, and the bread was like a rock. The entire thing was a bad experience.  So bummed!!!!

Ok gave it another try!!! 2 actually.  Me and the wife popped in. She had the bite it squash ravioli. Fantastic. Small portion but very good.  I had the lasagna. It was good tasting but cold in the middle. The sausage on the side was very good.  This time I ordered the Braciole. Based on Carlo himself a recommendation. Nicest guy! Speaks Italian which is nice.  The plant was $12.50 and came with the fresh homemade bread. The bread was cold for some reason.   The plate came out and Braciole is typically beef rolled into rolls stuffed with something or other. Not here.  It was a few slices of very dry beef and some slices of sausage. Not sure what the deal was with that but it was a very bland dish that needed much help in the form of Parmesan and Red pepper. I don't think he puts much seasoning into his sauces. It strikes me as though he is cooking for seniors with his flavor profiles. Ie: low sodium for high blood pressure folks maybe? No clue.  As I said, the guy is super nice, the rest of the people working here are kinda quiet.  I think we are done trying it for awhile with places like Pestos, La Stalla and even spaghetti factory so close.

Meh. It's decent Indian and has a decent selection but the high quality isn't there and they really skimp on the meats on their buffet.  Not to mention the Tandoori is really dry and seems like they cook it days before and microwave it or something. Kinda has a very weird sandy texture.  I'd skip it. Better Indian food around and $12.99 is a lot for a buffet of this quality.

Horrible.   Went here based on a referral from someon who said "if you like angry crab you should try hot and juicy".   Couldn't be further from the truth!!  Nothing about this place is better than Angry Crab. Not the shrimp, the sausages were tiny and not very tasty. The Softshell crab and the calimary were the saltiest things we have every tasted. We couldn't even finish them. The sauces are not hot even when we asked for spicy.  The drink orders got messed up at least 5x during the meal. The server girl had no clue or interest in what she was doing.  If you want good food of this type stick with Angry Crab. This place is all over the place.

Meh. Decent brussel sprouts dish although it was greatly lacking in the flavor dept.  We also has 6 different kinds of their Bruchetta. The Avocado one was the only one that all 4 of us really had much positive to say about. For the most part they were fairly blah.  The fish tacos on Happy Hour were quite good.  The service was very slow and the order was messed up on the first round coming out. Had to be sent back.  We drove all the way from Chandler to try this place so that made it an extra bummer for us. Maybe they were having an off day.

I think the current rating for this place is not fair. It's actually pretty decent for a Chinese buffet. They definitely take their time and make some decent sushi as well as have quality ice cream and a decent Mongolian barbecue.  We can't really expect five star food at a Chinese buffet but I was say this place does pretty decent

Absolutely unacceptable.   We were a group of 5 professionals that came in after the Good Life Festival. We got there, were told the wait would be 20 mins. There were 4 empty tables, (all dirty) that we could see and a line of at least 15 people waiting. So we waited. As we are sitting outside I make the comment this place seems very poorly managed, there are empty cups and dirty tables all over. Things on the floor, Just bad.  1hr later!!! We decide to go ask whats the status. We were told they were cleaning off our table.  We get seated by the bathroom. No problem. our waiter comes over with a trainee girl, takes our drink order (4 cocktails, 1 water for 5 people). 20 minutes goes by!!! He comes back over with our food and says "hey so just for everyones safety we do have a 2 drink maximum here so I just want to make sure that you guys do have a designated driver". how embarassing! We were not even drunk AND we had a designated driver sitting right there with us drinking water.  In my opinion he forgot our drink order and tried to cover his tracks. Unacceptable. We were embarrassed and decided to ask for the manager. We were referred to a kid named JORDAN, who assured us that he would make it all right and call us the next day to offer us something for ths embarassment and inconvenience. We said fine here is our number and of course, HE NEVER CALLED. No apologies, nothing. Poorly managed, poorly staffed and just overall an absolutely horrible experience at an establishment we have been frequenting in other locations for a decade.  Not good.

Nickel and Dime!!!  Whatever you do don't try and make your own salad here. Want an extra tablespoon of bell peppers? $.70  Want a tablespoon of cheese? $.70  By the time you're done you have a barely satisfying $11 small salad mindlessly prepared by a 20yr old with an attitude.  Pass!

They aren't ready for a Friday or Saturday night.   We are regular diners at Lou Malnatis and this location in Phoenix is just not up to par.  The Bad:  90 min wait  Pizza was totally off and took 30 mins to get even after preordering 90 mins early.  It was uncooked dough in the middle, too hard on the bottom and watery around the sides. Very odd. We also keep it simple because that's all you usually need at Lous. Sausage butter crust. Boom. Done. This was unedible.   The good:  The manager took care of the pizza and gave us a small frozen one to take home. She admitted it wasn't right and couldn't put her finger on why.  The Malnati salad is awesome. Always.  The atmosphere is nice here but the restaurant is much too small for the type of crowd they draw in.

*Edited*  The owner handled this review very well and offered to make it right. While I don't want anything from them I can appreciate the way it was handled.   At the end of the day they did a very good job but the wait and speed was slower than ideal by quite a margin. Things happen.

Tried this place once at a friends house when he got a handful of these burritos to go. It wasn't bad so we decided to try it another day.  Horrible. Super dry and tiny burritos. Had to return 2 of them because they were just too dry. Especially the RCB (new mexico red chile). The egg and chorizo burrito was mostly tortilla with a little bit of Chorizo and about 1 full egg. It was fairly tasteless.  Probably won't be back. Which is a bummer because we live right by it.  With Senor Taco and Filibertos so close by its gonna be tough to survive with tiny dry burritos for $4.50 each. Just my opinion.

This is Sicilian Pizza. They call it the DEEP DISH here but its Sicilian for all you New Yorkers out there.  This is as good of a sicilian pie as you will find in this town. It is excellent and reasonably priced.  Don't go crazy with the toppings IMO or it loses. Pepperoni and Sausage is how we do it and its bonkers good. Slight crispyness to the slices and nice delicious doughyness that a Sicilian should have.  This place wins. Its takeout or delivery only so be advised. Don't bring the family there for a sit down. They have like 3 tiny little 1 person tables in there for lunch diners.  Bomb pizza.
