Discount Tire quoted me 519 Dollars for two tires on my Escalade.  I checked with Brian's Tire Pros and they got me the same exact tires for 415.00 out the door.  It took about an hour to do the work.  If you want the best price I would use Brian's Tire Pros.  They may take a little longer to do the work, but I would rather have them take their time and do it right, than have a bunch of teenagers at Discount Tire do it wrong and over charge me.  Pete was the guy that helped me, I am a good judge of character, he was honest with me, he can be trusted.

$40 dollars for Sauce, Dough, Cheese, and Sausage?  Give me a break.  My wife and I go out often.  This was the worst service I have received in years.  Over priced hole in the wall pizza joint.  We heard good things, we were not sure what people see in this place.  Not for us.

The best steak on the planet!  I have never had a better meal.  A bit pricey, but worth it!

Arizona Federal Credit Union is the best bank in Arizona.  I have been with Wells Fargo, Bank Of America, Comerica, and none of those banks come close to the service and the financial products that Arizona Federal Credit Union has.  Nice work AZ Federal, I am impressed.

I was very impressed with their service, and the price was not as bad as I thought it was going to be for the repairs.  My convertable top was not functioning properly.  They fixed it fast, and at a low cost.  Usually I just come to expect to have a bad experience when dealing with car repairs, but not here.  A nice pleasant surprise.  Nice work Mercedes!  I love my Kompressor!
