Amazing customer service! I've been having a problem with a wedding I purchased. I wasn't able to wear it because I was allergic to the band. It's sitting in it's box in my closet because I was told by a different location that I couldn't return it and get a different one. The lady I talked to here was appaled and said there was no reason why I couldn't because I was still planning to get a ring through them anyway. She was super nice and I plan on returning so that I can finally get my ring!!!!

Taco Bell is losing my love. Apparently you now have to pay to get a water cup. In Arizona of all places. Now i'm not ignorant, I get that they're covering their costs for the cups. But the one thing I could always count on in Arizona was free water, and that the fast food restaurants gave you a cup for free. Now slowly that's going away.

Soda is ALWAYS flat here, if I'm going to pay for soda i'd like it to be decent... Table was dirty as well

Me and my husband try to eat at new places. We tend to be picky eaters, so this is our way of trying  to broaden our likes. We love mexican so this was this weeks new try. I LOVED it! We started with the jalapeno bean dip and a cheese crisp. The dip was fantastic!!! I loved every bite. The chips they served with it were light and fluffy. Our cheese crisp came out late so they took it off our bill. We didn't even say anything about it, our waitress just said that because it came out 5 after our meal came out that it was on them. Excellent customer service in my opinion. I had lunch special A, a cheese enchilada and a taco with rice and beans. It was great, wasn't anything that made it stand out, but it was very good. Definitely will return, and maybe some friends will join =)

I love the look of this store. The walls with the descriptions (such as dairy or seafood) are eye catchers. Everything is clean, which is always a bonus when it comes to food.

Love this place for pizza! Usually come for lunch since they have great lunch specials. The slices are a decent size and tastes delicious!

Tons of flavors to choose from! You could get something different everytime for awhile keeping the place new. Friendly staff at this location. The I've is smooth, best shaved "sno" you can get. Isn't chunky at all, no big cubes of ice

I had really bad customer service tonight. I hate when I'm treated rudely. My husband and I went to order at the drive through but were unsure what we wanted and asked to give us a moment. Right when we were about to order she rudely says "are you going to order or not" no one was behind us, it's 10 at night so the dining room is closed. I've worked in customer service and this appalled me. No matter how you feel about the customer you always smile and test with respect. Clearly they need some staff training on customer service. At least I like wendy's food

This was the BEST service I've had in awhile. We were always checked up in and taken care of. Drinks were hardly empty for long. Staff was friendly. An all over amazing experience for my birthday dinner. So glad this was the restaurant that was chosen. They were amazing!

My husband and I weren't sure what we wanted to do for lunch on our date day. We got out of our movie and san felipe's caught our eye. We asked to see the menu and while we were looking the manager came by. He talked to us about some of the favorites both his and guests. We still weren't sure but we were starting to want to stay. He said he was going to "bait" us and offered an appetizer on him if we stayed and had lunch. So we decided to try it out and we weren't disappointed. Amazing food, we both had the mini taco platter where you pick three meats and build your own taco. There was cheese, cabbage, pico, baja sauce, hot sauce, we subed the guac for sour cream and then some lime wedges. The meat was juicy, flavorful and savory. I left stuffed and satisfied. We ended up getting the queso blanco dip for the appetizer, I'm not usually a fan of velveeta, but it was good here. I am really glad we decided to stay, and urge anyone else to try it out! Thank you Gary for "baiting" us in =)

Nice and friendly staff. There's the "shoe dog" where you figure out the best shoe for you. There are also treadmills where you can test out the shoes as well. It does run to the pricey end , but you get what you pay for.

Pretty good BBQ joint, local business. My husband wanted to try it because it was opened by Brady Bogen on 97.9 KUPD. Our waiter was amazing, and funny. We were able to seat ourselves which was nice.  We started the meal off with the quesadilla which was really good. Probably one of the best items I ate. We both got the 2 meat platter and both got brisket (3 oz.) And baby back ribs (1/4 rack). For sides I did garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. He did corn bread and mac and cheese.   Their rub they use on the ribs is kind of strong. You get used to it as you eat, but it's definitely a slight assault to your senses. And i'm not sure i'm a fan of the mac and cheese, I think it's cooked with jalapenos which I normally don't mind but it was an overwhelming flavor.   I really loved the brisket, and the garlic mashed potatoes were amazing! I'd go back again and maybe try one of the sandwiches =)

First time on this train and it was great! We were able to bus, light rail and train so that we didn't have to take a shuttle, taxi or pay for parking. The train was nice, quick and easy to navigate. The only thing to remember is that it drops you off on the 3rd floor so you have to go downstairs to check your bag! Me and my husband were a little lost at first not realizing we were on the 3rd floor =)

I like panda express, and I like this new layout. However if I'm going to eat somewhere I want to ne treated a certain way. I'm buying THEIR food with MY money. I can easily go to a different location. Fix the staff attitude please. "they're high schoolers" is no excuse. There is still a professional standard everyone has to follow. Get a shift manager that makes sure the restaurant is running smoothly and everyone is treated with the respect they should be given. Don't gossip the entire time.
