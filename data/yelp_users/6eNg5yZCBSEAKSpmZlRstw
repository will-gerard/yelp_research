Very nice people i have nothing against the service.  I ordered the Carne Asada Fries based on the name being US Fries.  I was asked during my order if I would like to add Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Cheese.  I agreed as I like those things with my Carne Asada Fries.  this almost doubled my price order from $11 to $18.  I am a bit of a foody and i agreed as I was going to share them with a friend.  What came next looked very good.  There was Carne Asada, Guac, Sour Cream, and Cheese on top of french fries.  The surprise came in the first bite when I tasted gravy and cheese curds mixed together with the guac, sour cream, pico, and carne asada.  My friend and I really wanted to give it a shot, but the brown, green, white blend that started to form was inedible.  This place should probably be called US Poutine as is it seems this is put on EVERY entree.  A little warning would have been helpful, and $18 for one entree seemed highly excessive.

Best Mexican food I have ever had in Arizona!  Hands down! Don't know what to recommend because it's all so good.  Lots of flavor. Lots of heat.  Amazing food!
