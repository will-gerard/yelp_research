Slices is amazing! The place is kinda small but their pizza is SO GOOD! I always get the Pineapple pizza and love it. They have different types of pizza on some days like one time they had the baked potato pizza and it was delicious. Don't forget to ask for ranch!

This place is ALWAYS dirty! And lots of people who come here are so sketch. I always feel like I need to prepare myself for the worst before I walk into this place. The only reason why it's 2 stars and not one is because I really enjoy their donuts.

Red Robins is AMAZING! I don't recommend getting an appetizer because your actual meal will really full you up. Loved the Cupcake shake. Their burgers and wraps are also so yummy! Try!

I think it's because I came here during a good time is why I'm giving this place 4 stars. The people were nice and Ice cream looked amazing. The floors could use a little cleaning as there are some trash under that tables but other than that I had a good experience

It is a very small place, during rush hours, don't expect to get a seat or it inside. They're Pho is amazing though I introduce this place to all my friends. The staff is friendly and the food is great. Definitely recommend

I honestly love cafe rios food. There system may be kind of messy but the final product is delish! I think a person just needs to figure out how to order exactly what they want from the menu to be satisfied :)

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! BEST BOBA IVE EVER TASTED. They have SO many flavors it's endless and you can do combination. And there's so many types of boba from tapioca boba, popping boba and jelly ! I had the Watermelon slush with green apple popping boba and I loved it so much

Our waiter did not offer refills on any of our drinks .. He also was a little weird. Place was nice though. I got a quesadilla but stopped eating it because I didn't really like the cheese they were using. Hostess was nice as well.
