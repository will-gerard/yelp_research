Look, there is a lot of yumminess going on up in here but check it. You need to get a cheese crisp. There are little Mexican Nana's in the back sprinkling them with love and magic.

We were staycationing at The Arizona Grand so we came here for supper. I wasn't expecting much as the reviews were just so so. It was more about the slide and the kitchy-ness really.   Imagine my surprise when everything was delicious! From the fry bread and biscuits brought before the meal to the well seasoned veggies and the excellent steak! I had the filet and my boys had the porter house and a sirloin cut. Everyone enjoyed their meal!   They fell short in  few areas. The side of sauteed mushrooms I ordered were not good. They were not seasoned at all. I sent them back. The potato skins we had ordered for apps never showed up. We asked about them and when they showed up they had green onions on them we had asked to be left off. Also, they had wandering balloon sculptors and card trick magicians going from table to table working for tips. It was kind of irritating when they didn't take the hint we were not interested in them coming to our table.   All in all a solid experience though really. Better than I had expected :)

Just no. Never again. The fish was hard. Like it had been sitting out and then microwaved. Same for the fries. The special sauce was watered down. My pop tasted like it came from a dirty dispenser. Absolute ca-ca.   The woman who took my order in very broken English seemed absolutely irritated I had the nerve to place an order. When I got to the window I saw that she was engrossed in some TV show she had on and was eating herself...right behind the register. So gross. So tacky. So never going back again.

The OB/GYN I have gone to for 15 years retired and I needed a new specialist. Dr. Eddy accepted my insurance and what I could find to read about him online was all good so I made an appointment for a consult for an ablation.   The office staff was nice. Both times I was there I was in and out very quickly. Dr. Eddy wasn't overly chatty but definitely made sure all my questions were answered. Personally I want to get in and out when I go to the doctors so his pace was perfect for me. He instilled confidence in me in his ability and completely explained the procedure and the pros and cons.   I was scheduled a few weeks later and I could not be happier with the choice I made. The procedure was very simple (from my end) and not painful at all. Mild discomfort. I took the pain meds he prescribed the day of the procedure only. The next day I was absolutely fine.   Dr. Eddy had prepared me in what I should expect in the 3-4 weeks it takes to recover so there were no surprises. My results are exactly what I had hoped for and I only wish I had done it sooner.   Even drawing blood for my lab work was done on the first poke...something that never happens with my terrible veins. The back office staff was all very caring and should I need to visit the GYN again I will go back to see Dr. Eddy.

Just plain good.   My husband and I went with our three youngest kids. They loved it, we loved, we all left full and happy.   My husband and I had the Fry Bread Tacos. The fry bread was perfect. I had the green chili with all the fixins' and my husband had a red chili and cheese taco. He hadn't been all that excited about going here for dinner, but he changed his mind pretty fast!   Both the red and green chili were delicious. I preferred the green.   One son had a bean and cheese burro which was perfect from the tortilla to the beans that were cooked perfectly.   Another son had the folded cheese crisp and I don't know what they did to it to make it so yummy but I think it might have had a little magic in it.   For dessert we shared a chocolate butter fry bread and it was to die for but VERY rich. To share it between the five us we had more than enough.  The man at the counter was helpful and funny (in a sassy sort of way) and we didn't hold it against him that he was wearing and ASU shirt ;) GO CATS!  If you are over on this side of town - this is a must stop. Go, go, go!

Loved it! We took our little boys to Sweet Cakes before an afternoon at the Mesa Temple and it was yummy!   The offer a kids meal and our boys ordered grilled cheese sandwiches. Nothing out of the ordinary but perfect for a 4 year old and a 7 year old. My husband had a ham and swiss melt that he said was good and I really enjoyed the turkey, avocado, and sprout sandwich I ordered.   I am thinking this is more of a ladies lunch place. I liked the fact that the sandwich was not so big that you didn't wonder how you would even be able to take a bite but my husband left saying he was still hungry.   Sandwiches come with a chocolate chip cookie that is the main reason for the 5 stars. I am a picky person about my chocolate chip cookies and this was the best one I have ever had. EVER.   We also got some baked goods. Sugar cookies, brownies, and a giant Oreo cookie...all of which were delicious!

Elmer, I love you.  I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good.   If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.  Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.  And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids.   I love you Elmer. I always will.

I give Headquarters four stars more for the comfort and familiarity factor than the fine dining experience :)  We often head to Headquarters for breakfast and it is standard diner type breakfast and always good. I usually get an omelet but my boys love the French Toast and pancakes.  Headquarters does not call itself a Mexican Food Restaurant but there is lots of Mexican Food and it is muy good. I always order the green chili chimi with red sauce. It is always good with a very homemade feel.

Bring cash, they don't take credit cards.   Super simple chicken, beans, salsa, marinated onions...put it all together in a warm tortilla and you have one happy mouth.   I used to go here a lot when I worked in Tempe. It was always good then and that was 10 years ago. I went again recently with my husband and it was just as I remembered it.   Cheap and delicious...if you are in the neighborhood give it a try!

I am not really a huge fan of BBQ but for whatever reason that was what we decided to do.   We went on a Saturday Night and had I known they take reservations we would have made some. You should too!   Once we did have our table our waited was a adorable 20 something guys who was absolutely attentive. So much so that when the manager strolled through checking on guests I probably raved about the service more than the food.   I was with three of my sons who are 12, 9, and 3. My little ones had the mac and cheese. It was super excellent.   My older son had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich and I had the pulled pork. I ordered the coleslaw for my side since I like it on my BBQ. The pecans in the slaw are a stroke of genius.   Cornbread is served that is very good while you are waiting for your meal. We also got the QRolls for an appetizer. My boys loved them. I thought they were OK.   When you leave they give you a little bag of cinnamon donuts that are made in a little machine up front. The idea is cute but the donuts aren't good. They were actually kinda gross!  At the end of the day it is all about the sauce and the sauce was very good!   I would skip the cornbread (even though it is free). It actually spoiled my appetite. I would skip the much praised QRolls too. The pulled meat sandwiches and slaw were worth a visit if that is what you might be craving!

After tonight, never again.   I have always happily paid more for pizza and eats at Rosatti's because the ingredients were always high quality.   No more...  Rosatti's just sucks anymore. Toppings are not as high quality as they used to be and they have changed the type of cheese they use and it is icky. It doesn't melt right or something. It's gross.   Tonight I didn't feel like cooking or even going to pick up anything so I called Rosati's and ordered a family pan of baked spaghetti with meatballs, garlic bread, and salad. We got a piece of chocolate cake to share too.   It was ridiculously gross.   It was basically a pan of wet noodles in a "meat sauce" (If there was meat, we didn't see it) that was watery too. It was all covered in that weird gummy cheese and the meatballs tasted like they had freezer burn.   The salad was wilted and browned on the edges and the cake also had a taste of having been frozen for a long time.   Overall $40 straight down the drain since my family would not even eat it.   I would call and complain but the smart ass that always answers the phone could care less so why even bother?

I am a fan. Fo shizzle. Cute, clean, drive through for pick up orders...ah yeah...indulge my laziness...  My favorite here is the shredded beef crunchy tacos and the mini chicken chimi's with guac although the guac can be hit or miss.   The taco salad with chicken and avocado is the jam too.

A perfect place for a lazy Sunday morning breakfast! I had the Chef's special which was an asparagus and swiss omelet with a red pepper cream sauce. To die for yummy! The little biscuits and home-fries served with it were delicious too!   My boyfriend had the chicken enchilada and loved it.   Our only criticism would be for the drinks. He had a Bloody Mary. The drinks were premade so they could not customize. He said there was too much pepper and not enough Worcestershire.   They don't serve any pop either. Pop is my caffeine fix of choice so that was a bit of a bummer.   Service was good and it was fun to walk around the property while we waited for our table.

We drove all the way from Maricopa to Sunny Slope after my teenage son and his friend saw it on Man vs. Food (duh). They each got the Del Rey which is a huge meat filled sandwich, the same one Adam ate when he was there. My son finished it and thought it was delicious...his friend thought it was just too much meat and didn't finish his.  I had a Beef Nortena which was flavorful and spicy and HUGE!   I forget what our other friend had but she was very happy with it.   The menu was extensive but we didn't really look it over since we knew we were coming for the Tortas (Mexican Sandwiches). Service was great but do not expect the waitresses to speak fluent English.   My kids enjoyed the kids menu too!  It really was a TREAT and if we are ever up that way again it is someplace we would go again!

It was very much...meh.  I don't trust seafood in the desert to begin with anyway. We ordered the alligator appetizer...mostly so our kids could tell their kids they have eaten alligator.   Now having spent 7 years living in South Florida, I have eaten some gator and done right it tastes good. You know, like chicken :)  This was not the case at Islamorada. It was rubbery and not even edible. When the waiter asked if we liked it (the plate was untouched with the exception of one bite I took and one my husband took) we told him it was terrible. I expected him to offer to take it off our bill, but that didn't happen.  The fish and fries were fine. My husband had a hamburger and said it was fine too.   We ended up at Islamorada because after visiting Santa at the Bass Pro Shop they gave us kids eat free coupons. We gave them to the waiter but the kids meal were still on the bill. Didn't feel like arguing about it, so we left.

We went here for my 40th Birthday and it was yummy!   I love all things quirky and this place is. Very romantic and fun. The tables and chairs are a modge podge of different styles, like it was all purchased from a garage sale and it just happens to all really work together.   There are candles everywhere and on the tables there are small vases with water and sprigs of rosemary.   They have a bar but we do not drink alcohol so we tried their citrus drink and lemonade. Both were delicious and light. I wish we could buy them at the store!  At our waitresses recommendation I had the pork loin with spinach and fennel with a spicy cream sauce. There was a pear and mango sort of salsa on the pork which was very good!  My husband had the waffles and chicken. The waffle is where Tuck Shop lost a star for us. The waffle came out burned, like parts of it were black. There was only one other couple dining there so it isn't like the kitchen was rushed and they could not have possibly missed that it was burned, like I said, parts of it were black.   My husband raved about the fried chicken. I had a taste and it was cooked perfectly. The coating was spicy and crunchy but very thin (thin in a good way - like not a bunch of flour gooped on and fried sort of way) He is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever known and he really enjoyed his meal too.   We shared a piece of chocolate cake with flan. I wasn't a huge fan but if you are into flan it probably would have been a winner. My husband enjoyed the bottom cake part of it.   The cookie dough balls at the end were a treat. I wish we could have ordered a little box of those yummies to go!   Our waitress was darling and attentive and I am glad we ventured into Phoenix to check out Tuck Shop. It was a treat!

I had to convince my husband to come here because there was a 25 minute wait...which turned out to really only be about 10 minutes.   I have no clue what the bad reviews are about because we left Crackers and Co full and happy and ready to head back for another visit!   I had the California Benny. Everything was garden fresh, cooked perfectly, and so good. The California Benny is Eggs Benedict with avocado and fresh spinach and so very good. I could have easily shared this plate with someone else. I was too full from just one of them (two come) that I didn't even have room left to eat those yummy potatoes!   My husband had the carnitas with chorizo and potato egg scramble. I think if we had been alone he would have licked the plate.   There was no room left in our bellies to try the desserts but they all looked wonderful!

I want to like this place. I really do. Everyone else seems too. Everything I have ever had here from bean burritos to tacos to breakfast has just been very meh.   It is clean and cute and has fun pop in glass bottles but I am just not seeing a reason to go back.

Ermahgah...this burger was just yummy. Amazing to see your burger made from real beef. Cooked and seasoned right there in front of you. Novel idea eh?   All the toppings were fresh and delicious. My little people get  hot dogs and they were crazy yummy too. If they eat their dogs they get shakes and that is where the magic is. Sadly dairy hurts my tummy but I did try a few little sips and the shakes are made from real ice cream and make my three little boys chirp with happiness all the way home!

Sucked.   We went there specifically to order the Breakfast Sandwich and were told they were out of the ingredients to make them (at 10:00am on a Saturday???).   They kids menu was $4.99 and consisted of a drink and one big cold and dry pancake.   It took 45 minutes for them to bring out our order. The waitress stopped by after 30 minutes and apologized. She said there was a large party in the back room that was wrapping up and they would get to our order soon...ugh.   I asked her if I could change my order and she said she would go into the kitchen to see if they had started it yet...and never did. She went to the next table and hugged a group of her friends that had come in and talked to them for 10 minutes. After finally seeing I was giving her the stink eye she went into the kitchen and came back out to tell me that they had started my order (no crap lady).   Everything was VERY run of the mill and we won't be back.

Love Chick-Fil-A  After I had my baby last fall the hospital brought in some disgusting excuse for food.   I delivered at CRH right down the street from Chick-Fil-A and asked my husband to please go get me a chicken sandwich.   I have been to Chick-Fil-A lots of times and it is always good, but let me tell you folks, it tastes about a bajillion time better if you have just delivered a 9 pound baby!  I love how everyone at this location is SO polite. Whenever you say thank you they respond, "My pleasure."  I keep it simple. I like the plain chicken sandwich with pickles, waffle fries, and a diet Dr. Pepper.   A total favorite!

Yep...this was yummy stuff folks.  We had supper here before heading to The Sugar Bowl for youngest son's first birthday celebration.  Our crew started with the Pig Wings. Mine is a family of carnivores and they were all super happy with these little pork nuggets. I tasted them and they were so good! Very tender and the sauce was amazing.  We all had burgers or some sort. We had the smaller sized burgers since we were headed for ice cream next and they were more than enough (for me they were at least!)  My favorite at Rehab was the sweet potato tots. Pure genius. Served with a little pineapple sort of dip. My baby boy and I loved them!   The decor was relaxed and the service was EXCELLENT!  If you are in Old Town Scottsdale don't miss it!

Aside from the obviously delicious chicken sandwiches and waffle fries I love to come to Chick-fil-a because they are just so dang polite. I say "thank you" as many times as I can just to hear them say "my pleasure"!   My kids love their shakes more than any other ice cream treat anywhere!   I also love that they are closed on Sundays (except when I want waffle fries on Sundays!) and their conservative stance and support for First Responders. I am a customer for life.

Meh. They weren't all that. Had better at other franchises. The store was kind of dirty. The pretzel I got my son was stale. No didn't eat it. There was no one else in the store. I stood at the counter with my eyes wide open looking at one of the girls...she seemed shocked when she asked me if I was ready to order and I said yes. What the heck?

Never again,   Ever.   We tried True Grit because the ratings on Yelp were good. A rare thing in Maricopa. We were hesitant to take my kids because it is a "Tavern" but thought there would be a restaurant side to it as well.   Nope. It's a straight up bar.   With drunk people playing pool and bumping into our chairs and being incredibly loud like...in my ear...and the manager seemed to think that was ok.   The food was mixed. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms. Don't. They were 5% mushroom and 95% batter. Gross.   I had the club sandwich and fries which were fine. My oldest son had a create your own burger which he enjoyed. My little boys had the kids menu grilled cheese and cheese burger sliders. Both good. The kettle chips that came with one meal were terrible. Stick with the fries.   My friend had the nachos which were disgusting. The meat had not been seasoned at all and the whole thing was covered in grease. It was canned cheese which was funny since the manager made a big deal of telling us how fresh, locally sourced, blah, blah, everything was.  The worst was the delivery to the table. Everyone's food came out with 5-10 minute intervals in between. Even my fries came 10 minutes after my sandwich. We were all finished eating before the nachos ever even came out. Ridiculous.   We talked to the manager who comp'd the mushrooms and drinks and took 5% off the bill. Whatever. He tried to give us a gift certificate for $10 but kinda dumb since we will NEVER be back there again.   When we complained about the drunks who were STILL backed right up to our table he just sort of shrugged. Unbelievable.   The very best part of this horrific night was watching the purple haired cook in the back lift up her shirt and scratch her belly while leaning over the prep counter and flirting with the other girls in the kitchen. Maybe if she spent less time scratching and flirting she would be better able to time the food all coming out at the same time.   I am loathe to give local restaurants a bad review but this joint sucks. It is NOT appropriate for families at all.   It is excellent if you like drunks all over you while you and your family are trying to eat, enjoy incredibly loud women playing pool, long for horrible service, and crave greasy over priced food sprinkled with skin flakes.   Just don't.
