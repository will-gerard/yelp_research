This hotel looks a lot better than it smells. The lobby has the stench of too much cheap air fresher and the rooms, furnished in the 1970s faux wood motel style, carry the unpleasantly musty stink of the unconcealed carpet stains.   My room overlooked a dreary parking lot but on the bright side, the Internet was relatively quick and the hotel is minutes from the airport and the interstate. There are no decent food options within walking distance.   Charlotte is such a nice town, this hotel and its environs won't do your trip justice. Surprised that this meets the Starwood standard.

Zumanity is over the top, wonderful burlesque fun. The acrobatic performances are breathtaking, the costumes are eye-popping, and the comedic routines are hilarious. Others have commented that it's not for the prudish, but this is Vegas and if you're down to party, you'll love it. Married guys - Zumanity is a better version of the strip club experience because you can enjoy it with your wife.   Pro tip - the bar sells 2 Jell-O shots for $5, which is one of the best deals in Vegas. If your wife isn't much of a drinker, this is a terrific way to get the juices flowing. Get 4 or 6 because they aren't that big.

You won't go wrong with Egg & I. The waitresses are practically giddy with happiness, the portions are humongous, the food is fresh and delicious, and the prices are very fair.   The location is about 5 miles west of the Strip, so this is primarily for locals, which adds a more normal vibe compared to the touristy traps that dot this crazy little town.

The blackened swordfish of the day was cooked perfectly but the chef drowned it in pepper, which was unfortunate because otherwise this fish would have been delicious. The squash soup (also a special of the day) tasted like it came from a can. The service here is very good but the food just doesn't add up.

Came here for a slice before Zumanity and the pizza was terrible - cold, bland, with a couple of desiccated mushrooms and tasteless tomato sauce. All that for $5.75 a slice -- avoid.

As a caveat, I'm only writing about my experience checking in.   Reserved a king size non smoking room for my birthday weekend and when I arrived they told me they were all out. Instead, the jerk at the front desk (Brian Clark) tried to put me in a 3rd floor room with two queen beds. How romantic. Mind you, I've had this reservation for more than a month.   When I asked for a supervisor he called one on the phone, and she said she was too busy to come out and talk to me.   Not much for a first impression. This may be a nice hotel but they obviously don't care much about the guest experience. I would never stay here again.

As an update, the crummy small room has dark and ugly furniture and the shower had very weak water pressure. We moved out of here after one night and into the Venetian, where the rooms were the same price, literally twice as large and the customer service far better.   Aria may be new but seriously, what a dump.

Attended my first rodeo ever last night at the National Finals Rodeo and it was awesome! The program included:  * Bareback Riding * Saddle Bronc Riding * Tie down Roping * Women's Barrel Racing ...and then the main event, Bull Riding  You can feel the dedication these cowboys and girls have for their craft, putting their bodies on the line in pursuit of fame and 'fortune'. The arena is enormous and the event started with a prayer and the national anthem, the former of which kind of caught me off guard but was appreciated nonetheless.   The energy in the arena is electric and its just a good old time packed with cowboys and beautiful cowgirls. The soundtrack is inspiring and the mc does a great job of keeping the crowd entertained, informed and engaged. The food situation is kind of weak, it's mainly 1980's era stadium fare, but there are concessions everywhere for reasonably priced food and beer and if you're attending this for the food then you've missed the point.   I've always wanted to attend a rodeo and now that I have, I can't wait to go again.

Enjoyed a wonderful lunch meeting here last week with a great view of the famous aquarium. While we were eating the aquarium was being cleaned by professional divers and the experience was surreal. I had the watermelon/feta salad and the blackened flounder with asparagus, and walked out in that sweet zone between hungry and stuffed, also known as 'just right'. Service was excellent as well.

Stayed at this wonderful hotel for three days and two nights this past week and never felt compelled to hit the casino because there's just so much positive energy everywhere else. I never actually saw the casino, unlike most other Strip hotels where you have to trudge through a stinky haze of blue smoke past the slots to get to the elevators, Cosmo's elevators are right next to the Reception up front.  My room (junior suite?) was on the 23rd floor in the west tower and I had a magnificent view of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower. The room itself is decked out with modern furniture, artsy coffee table books and hipster paintings. Also had a sweet balcony with a couch and ottoman (though admittedly the couch wasn't the most comfortable, but it was like 106 degrees outside so I didn't spend much time on the balcony). Huge bathroom features wonderful Bigelow soaps and products. If I could move in to this place, I would.   Had dinner at Blue Pearl with some friends and everything was excellent, especially the octopus appetizer! Afterwards we took the party to Chandelier, and much like the rest of the hotel the vibe was well dressed, affluent 30-40somethings out to have a great time. Great selection of 'mixologist' type cocktails. Just so much fun.   I can't wait to return to Cosmo, the coolest hotel in Vegas.

Everything about our meal at Halcyon was wonderful. The waiter had an encyclopedic knowledge of the wines both on and off the menu, and all his food recommendations were on point. We shared various plates - the more memorable selections were the cornbread, cheeses and lamb. The tomato soup was the only 'miss' to the experience, but hardly worth the mention. The rustic farm to plate selections matched the gentleman farmer decor and I can't wait to return.

Perfect little hole in the wall pizzeria tucked in a corridor on the third floor of Cosmo. Pizza was delicious, served quickly and they do such a brisk business here that everything is always fresh rightout of the oven. No seating in the pizzeria itself but there's plenty of comfortable hipster loungers and couches around the pool table directly outside the shop. Great little find.

The short rib eggs Benedict is one of the most decadent breakfast items imaginable. Couple it with a fruit smoothie to give yourself the illusion of a healthy breakfast.  Service here was good and the atmosphere is American bistro. Would have been nice to have some bread on the table to dip into the short rib au jus. Coffee selection was limited, no mocha. Great one-off experience but you're asking for a heart attack if you eat here on the regular.

This hipster wine, salad and sandwich shop is in the former Press space, and everyone I met in Charlotte still refers to it as Press. Food and drinks are inexpensive and delicious and they also have a great assortment of microbrewery bottled beers. Threes is an excellent lunch choice, whether you're eating in or taking out.

Those who know Primo know that I'm the risk-taking, living-on-the-edge gambler type, the sort your mom warned you against, the sort that has no problem letting strange barbers take their razor and scissors to my head with nothing but a Yelp recommendation for safety and comfort.   That's why, when I found myself in dire need of a haircut while on business in Scottsdale-Phoenix, I ended up in the very competent, very talented, and very hilarious hands of the father and son duo that run this follicle trimmery a couple of blocks from the W Hotel where I was staying.   The shop has the clubby feel of a man cave, with plush leather chairs, baseball memorabilia on the walls, and tvs tuned to The Fugitive (love that movie!). The experience was replete with mild racist, ageist and misogynist humor, the sort that sets apart an established shop from the crappy corporate owned chains whose sole intention is to upsell unnecessary products. At Shaving Grace, on the other hand, the only thing being sold aside from an excellent haircut is an old-world, graceful experience, and Primo now has a new go-to barber in Phoenix.   Highly recommended.
