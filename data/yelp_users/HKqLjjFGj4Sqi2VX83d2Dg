I'm SO Tossed up about this place...  When I need something for a DIY Project I go here first EVERY time & EVERY time I've left empty handed... Its a DIY Project that includes Arts & Crafts (Like in their name) HOW is it that I leave Empty Handed?   Depending on the time of the year this store isn't too crowded but the customer service is NO WHERE to be found... Will be heading to Joann's & Hobby Lobby from now on. Dear Michaels: I'm TIRED of leaving empty handed!

I Love Trader Joe's... Gosh I just might be obsessed with Trader Joe's!   The more you talk to the staff the more you will get to know their products & even packaging! This isn't a one stop shop grocery store, more like GREAT Quality, Real, Natural, Awesome Grocery Store.   IF you don't like how Small it is, IF you don't like the higher prices then you need to go back to Crap-Mart and stay there for the CRAP! :Rant Over:  In a silly way... Trader Joe's makes me feel like I live in a small community, where everyone knows each other... Going every week for over a year might be the reason. TJ's is a GREAT Supplement for the Hubster & I after visiting the Gilbert Farmers Market down the street... Here is a list of a few of my personal Favorites: Nothing But Bananas, Villa Alena Moscato Wine, Bolognese Pasta Sauce, Uncured Turkey Bacon, Olive Oils & Balsamic Vinegars, White Mac n Cheese, Goat Cheese with Herbs  Have fun when you walk in... Grab some Beautiful Flowers, Grab some Cheese, Meats, Veggies, Bread... try a Sample of their Daily Recipe!

Yelp is about being 100% Honest, All the Time right... Well here it goes.   Was in dreaded Mesa & had to run in to this Home Depot... Not my first choice. Ive been to Home Depots across the valley and certain Home Depots I feel comfortable walking the whole store by myself... but not this one. I don't know what it is, Who knows. All I know is that we went in looking for something and came out empty handed, HOW does that happen at Home Depot? Went to Gilbert and found it at Ace Hardware.   I wish I could tell you what the issue is with this Home Depot, Maybe its just me. Who knows... I'll shop Home Depot in Gilbert.

The last few weeks I have been in and out of this Napa way too many times and Thankfully they are a helpful bunch. I'm not saying they are Head Mechanics... but they are knowledegable and can even help the women that walk in to the store that don't know what a Radiator Cap is.   - The Customer Service is A-OK... Just depends on how lucky you are on who you get that day.  - The Cleanliness of the Store is A-OK... Its an automotive store... It can't be spotless! - The Selection of In-Stock Parts & Other Vehicle needs it Awesome. They almost  ALWAYS have what I need for my Truck in store & If not then its usually a 24 Hour Turn Around... How convenient is that!  - Hours are AWESOME as well, 7 Days a Week... Hey Discount Tire you need to get on this ship & Join the Open 7 Days a Week, Yes Even Sunday Businesses!   Keep up the good work guys... Will be in soon for more parts!

It may be one of those "Chain Restaurants" but does it fall under a "Fast Food Restaurant"? It's Fast but its Quality... and its Damn Delish... at least I think it is. Was happy to see that they have FINALLY added Brown Rice to the line up when I went in recently!   Everything I've ever had its been great, not fantastic... but Fantastic is hard to find these days. The chips freaking rock... not so much for the waist line but who counts calories at Chipotle? NOT ME!    Love that they have Green Tabasco Sauce... If they didn't... it wouldn't be a 4.5 Star. If they would add some Local Hot Sauce to the line up that would ROCK.   It may be a "Fast Food" Restaurant but its a billion times better than 99% of those other "Restaurants" that serve crap. Plus... they have a great concept and I love this commercial of theirs: http://youtu.be/aMfSGt6rHos  My Recommendation: Burritio, Brown Rice, Black Beans, Barbacoa, Fajita Vegetables, Tomatillo-Green Chili Salsa, Corn, Romaine Lettuce & Cheese. Chips w/ a Sids of the Tomatillo-Green Chili Salsa & Tomatillo- Red Chili Salsa. YUM!

Holly Freaking Cheap Goodness... Who knew that was possible before walking in to Lee's?   If your looking for Cheap Goodness come here for a Sandwich & a Boba Smoothie! It will fill you up for most of the day for well under $20!   When walking in you might... scratch that... you WILL feel out of place right away. A Vietnamese Sandwich Shop that serves French Baguettes... Crazy Cool Fusion is the thing these days right! Don't be scared, pull out your Cash (ONLY CASH!), choose your Sandwich (Personal Fav is #56 w/ Extra Meat), Pick your Smoothie (Personal Fav is Honeydew w/ Boba), Drool at the other goodies & Pay. Wait for your number to be called and get ready for the Freaking Cheap Goodness!   This is not a 5 Star Sandwich Shop... So don't expect it. Expect simple, made at home sandwiches with very limited stuff in fridge! #56 comes with a Pickle, a few slices of Onion, a package of mustard, a pepper & the Sandwich.... Simple.   Its Fast, Its Clean, Its Food... They do a great job at it. Give them a try... and you will either Love it or Hate it... Pretty sure you will Love it.

Living in Gilbert has a Few Perks & Freestone is near the top for sure! If you need to get a run in, need to relax and feed the ducks, or just need a place to take the kids to release some energy this is a FANTASTIC place to go!   The fact that they have Volleyball Courts, Batting Cages, Basket Ball Courts & Baseball Fields.... Makes this a VERY easy 5!

For Gilbert Wells Fargo Banks... This is my 1st Choice because of the Customer Service & No pressure banking. Other banks are pushy about signing up for Credit Cards, Savings Accounts and who knows what else... But not this bank.   Fast, Efficient, Friendly, Free bottle of Water (YEAH BABY!), Smiles from the Employees... You won't dread walking in to this bank unless your Broke & the bank won't give you a loan... But thats not their fault!

Gas, Gas, Gas, Gas... Did I say Gas? Hubby & I recently did a 2,000 Mile Trip & Costco saved our Pocket Book & our Bladders! LOL You can't go wrong with ANY Costco if your on a Road Trip!  Cheap Gas, Clean Bathrooms & Free Samples!   *Only wish would be a Window Cleaning Station at every Costco!

In life you have many choices... Buy Local or Buy BigBox. If you need a Local Hardware, in Gilbert, Choose this place for sure! The hubster usually has to drag me in to Ace Hardwares but NOT this one, I go voluntarily! *Don't tell him, but I will sometimes find a reason WHY he needs to go here if we are in the area! I did just hat the other day and he found EVERYTHING he had been searching for, EVEN Ball Bearings! *I think thats what they are called... ehh who knows!   There is something for everyone in the family at this store... Kids Section: Check, Pet Section: Check, Paint Section: Check, Tons of little things for the Husband: Check, Patio Section: Check!   My recommendation is to stop in here before heading to that BigBox Store, Ask one of the VERY Helpful Employees for ... and they will gladly help you out! Buy Local... It will make your heart smile!

SanTan Village how I LOVE Thee!   I'm not a "Mall" Type of person & SanTan being an "Open Air" Mall helps me enjoy this mall more than the other malls in town. I love the fact that there are many Adirondack Chairs & Umbrellas so the Hubster & I can sit, talk, relax & people watch at different parts of the mall!   Con #1 about the mall is that they don't have much shade for being an "Open Air" Mall, If vines were planted at Grand Opening the "Shade" Structures would actually have shade for customers during the summer... But last time I was there I DID notice Vines had been planted... hope they won't take too long to grow! YAY!  Con #2 about the mall is all of the Smokers. I find it silly how the Smoke Free Az signs are all covered by mini trees in pots... I understand its not the security guards job to tell these punks that NO SMOKING is a part of the SanTan Mall but I wish it was informed better... Might sound Lame to the smokers but Cigarette Smoke pollutes MY AIR & Causes my Hubsters Asthmas to act up.   Love Love Love that its in Gilbert & Excited to see what happens with the "New" Owner/Management Company that bought the mall!

The Hubster & I have been on a Tour of Arizona Eggs Benedicts and we currently have Mark's Cafe as #1 for Traditional as well as Specialty! Personally as a Breakfast joint if you can't make Eggs Benny... Then you shouldn't have a Breakfast Menu!   #1.The Traditional has a VERY NICE slice of Heaven... Ohh wait I mean Canadian Bacon compared to what other un-named places call a "slice".   #2. The Hollandaise Sauce... If I could ask for a To Go Soup container of Marks Hollandaise Sauce I would totally do it! Its magical... I'm not sure what he does differently but its easily the best Ive ever had!   We prefer Brunch vs. Breakfast so one morning we drove in to Tempe from Gilbert (Far I know! LOL) & arrived at 1PM for Breakfast. Even though they close at 2PM there wasn't a single bit of rushing us at all, unlike those "other" places. The food has been PERFECT every time, no matter what we order!   Menu Recommendations: Traditional Eggs Benny, Southwestern Eggs Benny (I prefer it with the English Muffin vs. Biscuit), The French Benny *Special* Croissant w/ Prosciutto... Lets say OMG! Banana Pecan Pancakes, Cajun Chicken Club w/ Cajun Fries!   This Local, Family Owned & Operated Restaurant.... ROCKS! Its worth the drive where ever your coming from! ;-)

HOT DIGGITY.... Wait should I say COLD DIGGITY!?! Ha ha ha  I was so excited when I walked in and found a VERY nice staff of Ladies looking to help a Gelato Newb! The ladies let me try MULTIPLE flavors of Gelato AND Sorbet!   Most of the time when you can sample at an establishment you get this vibe after 2 flavors that you need to hurry up... NOT HERE! They want you to be happy with what you purchase... at least thats was the vibe I got!   Whenever I try a new place I always ask "Whats your Favorite or What do you Recommend" & I got some FANTASTIC Recommendations!   My recommendation: Try, Try, Try before you buy!

I hate to start the year off writing a 1 Star Rebiew but it needs to be done.  We showed up at 3:30 with Free Tickets and were confused. The parking signs said $5 but we rolled right past them to park, we walked up to the entrance and people were walking right in. Are you telling me that the early birds had to pay $15 for entrance to THIS? I would be furious and asking for a REFUND personally!  The organizers of this event did it for the $$$ and did a HORRIBLE job all around.  Cons:  $10 to get in is Highway Robbery $5 to park in a dirt lot is a slap in the face $4 for WATER.... I'm getting really pissed off now HORRIBLE set up of the whole event. Why in the world did they think having the "dessert" trucks way in the back all clumped together was a good idea?  Not enough seating Tyler Florence.... Where were you?  Live Music.... Where were you?   I am all about Supporting Local Businesses but who ever ran this event was CLEARLY in it for the $$$ and nothing else! I hope that the food trucks made a profit in the long run because this event was disappointing.   Pros:  I got to taste Luncha Libre & it was TOTALLY worth the wait! Best damn Quesadillias in town!!  We were lucky enough to be there late so the lines died down dramatically and the food trucks were able to pump the food out!  Had a killer Pepperoni Pizza from The Pizza People... Yum! Had three scoops (yea yea I know) from Sweet Republic! LOVE this Ice Cream!   I'm happy that we didn't have to pay the entry fee and parking but anyone that did.... I'd ask for a refund. Let's hope this event doesn't put a sour taste in people's mouth about food trucks. They work their butts off at what they do!
