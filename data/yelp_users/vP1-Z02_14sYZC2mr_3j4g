Place looks decent from the outside but once you enter the restaurant, there are flies flying around everywhere and the place seemed old and filthy. The wait to be seated was not too long considering it is Father's Day, however the filth was unbearable. I'm talking about nasty smushed food stuck in between menu pages, seats are covered with crumbs and greasy finger prints, water spots on silverware, tables don't get wiped down with sanitation towels and I can go on, and on-but you get the point. Never going back! I'd rather starve...

The waiting can take a long time to see the Doctor, but it is well worth the wait. Dr. Corrigan is extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and gets right to the point. Although sometimes it can get annoying with his medical students.

Fast efficient service for your vehicle, a bit pricey but the employees here do a fabulous job.

Love everything about this place! Awesome sliders/burgers! Most of all they really have authentic Vienna beef! A great place to have lunch.

Best Pho in Arizona! You heard me! Absolutely delicious! Service is precise and efficient, food comes out exceptionally quick, ingredients taste so fresh and the broth in the pho is clean and heart warming. If your ever in the valley, stop by Va Dangs. Price is really, really, really cheap for the quality food they serve.

Was considering to give this place 3 stars but made my decision that the hospital is worth 4 stars. Had to take my mother to the ER today with the referral from her cardiologist. Took exactly 1hour and 20minutes to have her seen. The wait is what gave this place such a low rating. But when she got into a room, the ER staff were absolutely amazing! So nice and caring for my mother. The staff are truly wonderful but, that wait was most aggravating. Especially when my mother actually needed medical attention, unlike all the other drug addicts that come in for a quick fix.

Fantastic, Excellence, Superior, Delicious, these words do not give justice to Delux burgers. I get orgasms in my mouth every time I take a bite out of their burgers. My only problem with this place is the crowded space. If there was more room, this place would be heaven on earth.

Great service, good prices, friendly staff, I am loving this place!  Came here to grab some lunch for my dad and I, menu is easy to read, the food took a little longer than expected but, the place was busy.   No gun sign is kind of a bummer though.

Such a hidden gem!!! Hard to notice when just driving by, doesn't pop up when looking up all you can eat sushi. I was brought by some friends who told me that they served all you can eat sashimi. My reaction was like "probably serve a limited,small amount of sashimi for a ridiculous price" but low and behold this place is awesome!!! Yes, for sashimi and sushi all you can eat is $30 bucks but well worth it! Portions are big and generous, service was good and quality rocked!!! Will be back many, many times!

Heard great things about this place. My dad wanted to go here today for our Sunday family dinner. Got here and the place was closed... The sign said this place is open 7days 11-11pm, there seemed to be someone inside the restaurant as well and didn't even bother to tell us the reason why they were closed. If your going to close your business for some reason. Fucking put a sign you fucking morons!
