Too many shoppers, fully staffed store, and still not enough time for me.  Had to beg sales person to put shades on my lids.  Notta one was willing to do a full eye.  A girl had to leave in the middle of helping me to 'clock out' only to promise Mr. Man would be by to finish up.  He never came.    To top it off they were out of a few things I was told I needed to buy.  I guess this is what I get for trying to buy makeup in a tourist destination?

A huge thank you to Mon Ami Gabi for making our 7 year anniversary perfect!!!!!!  This place is hopping, so don't dream about going without a reservation. There's still a line when you have a reservation, and you can't reserve the patio which looks onto the Bellagio fountains.   They did a fabulous job of under promising and over delivering. We were 15 min early for our 8:00 reservation. Hostess said they were running 15 minutes behind. We tucked into the back bar, in the solarium (tres romantic!) and found two seats next to each other. Before we had our first sip the buzzer went off and we were whisked to a prime patio seat. The breeze was perfect, the outside temperate even more perfect, and the fountain shows - delightful. I wanted to stay all night!  Service was prompt and kind with a smile - plus he had great timing instincts. We asked for a gluten free menu. A baguette was then delivered, and within 40 seconds a second bread delivery was made to my husband: gluten free option!  Can you imagine...just by asking for the GF menu, the waiter knew to order GF bread. What love.   I made the mistake of skipping lunch, then being ravenous at 6:00 pm, and then gorging on Garrett's popcorn (cheddar carmel combo). So I wasn't really hungry for dinner.   We decided to order the raw-bar platter for two for $50, cold and refreshing. The best bits of it for me were the prepared lobster and the salmon/avocado tartar.  We joked that we'll never go back to Maine because now that someone has perfectly shelled and chilled our clawed crustacean it will never be the same with bibs.   I said no to dessert, and then they brought us a treat for the anny anyway. So delicious, so thoughtful...cut Celine Dion hitting high notes as the water spouts above the skyline.  Perfection.   -fin

We had intended to make an appearance for happy hour but got the times wrong.  Please note it's done at 5:30 (not starts at!)  This put a damper on our expectations: from affordable mexican eats to high end fare.  The latter fell short with bland, overpriced food.  Service was very pleasant, but do yourself a favor and avoid the chile relleno at all costs.  Bluck.

Beyond!  So scintillating, you can't take everything in at the same time.    In the past year and a half we've been to over half a dozen shows in Vegas, and this along with KA are ones I would see again.  Do yourself a favor and add this to your must see list.  We got our tickets day of at the half price booth, which saved us 25%.  It's a small theatre so there aren't any bad seats in the house and i almost think you can see more by sitting further back.  Enjoy!

Let me begin by saying that the bartender was fabulous - attentive, kind, fashionable, and a real heart for customer service.   For what we paid, I want the total package...  The ambiance here really blows. It's like you've stepped into one of those faux French "paintings" you buy at Marshall's that's anything but tres chic. Boxes of crap laying around, things tucked behind curtains or just sitting out.   I never met a flight I didn't love - who doesn't love a change of scenery after deplaning, or the variety that comes with sampling many wines. Flights will run you $18ish.  Isn't that a lot?  We did a sparkling and then a red option. My $5 glass of red during happy hour was just fine.   The food is sort of an afterthought here. It definitely wouldn't bring me back.  We had the savory cheesecake which continues to sit in my stomach the morning after, and a chopped salad which was overdressed and what I consider a lunch-sized portion.   With so few days in Scottsdale, I wish we would have skipped this and gone elsewhere. I guess that regret means 2*s.

With reviews like this I was expecting to never want to leave this place.  We went for breakfast and I won't go making this a destination for early morning fare ever again.  I'm not docking stars for limited B, just reviewing based on what we ate which was BREAKFAST BEYOND BLAND.  Decor is delightful and they do have outdoor strip seating, but you're better off sticking to the liquid and saving up for a buffet.    Ham/egg/cheese on ciabatta was $13   Irish breakfast (size and quality of Dennys) will run you $16

The kind of happy hour to write home about. Hight quality -  beckoning us to come back for a full meal. Real artisanal cocktails. Shrimp and grits, lobster, and duck salad oh my!

Hug mugs, need I say more?  I went home with two of them.    This was a great compromise when we no longer wanted an all you can eat buffet.  They have breakfast and lunch and of course chocolate.  Our waitress was really, really nice.  I ordered a cookie to go, which came to $5 - yowzers that's a lot of change.   Still remember meal fondly.

A tapas centered buffet, with lots of good quality small plates; perfect for me who just wants a taste and HATES wasting food.  You don't have to waste food here. {Accolade #1}  HOT TIP #1 - They have sorbet in dessert section which I found to be a perfect pallet cleanser between courses. I did the blood orange.    {Accolade #2}  - Pulled pork tacos with homemade guacamole.  Awesome meat/carving stations. I went back twice for the homemade bacon that I could possibly marry.  They slice for you in thick slabs. Yumm, yum.   Complaint #1 - Not a lot of green vegetable options.  I did enjoy the asparagus salad and the kale salad but that was pretty much it for "real" greens.  The wedge salad had sad lettuce.  Abundant potato options.    HOT TIP #2 - Drink happy hour: $5 before 7:00 PM.  They're strict. Don't sit down at 7:01, you will be denied.   We were sad to miss out on top shelf margaritas, but refused to pay $12 at a $44 buffet.   Complaint #2 - Fishy salmon. Boo!  I love salmon.   {Accolade #3}  Desserts that actually taste good, and a gluten free dessert station!

Very comfortable bar chairs and a nice bartender. Juicy burger cost $14 but came with delicious truffled tater tots.  A nice escape from the mayhem at Bond.

I'm in biz, beauty business that is, and I'm partial to the amazing blowdrys my students give me at TONI&GUY. But, I was in town on vacation and thought why not see what all the buzz is about?    What I got was an amazing blowout that lasted me 6 days - yep SIX DAYS!!!  It even looked fab after the redeye and a full day of work.    Things that I loved: *movies playing *magazines *the right amount of chatter from my stylist *the finished look *the longevity of the work  Things I missed: *champagne (apparently they don't have the right license in AZ) *an amazing scalp massage - I guess this was an up charge, but it wasn't even offered to me.   If a location was closer to my home, this could really mean trouble. I see how ladies get addicted!

Rarely do I leave a place and pen immediately.  However, Leticia deserves it and then some.  Hands down best mani pedi I can remember.  She's super chill...not a barrage of questioning.  Inspects and shapes to perfection.   Salon opens at 10:00, and the online booking system wouldn't let me do a manicure and pedicure because it was 10 minutes too long given the other appointments on the books.  I showed at 9:40, and much of the staff was there already setting up.  They took me early and gave me the add on manicure that I wanted.  Having been a lady that contracted (and conquered!) a nail fungus from a reputable, but thank GOD, now defunct spa several years ago, I am militant about who and where I get my nails done.  Nail funguses are easily spread - but it's not gonna happen here!  They take every precaution for sanitization: lined buckets for the pedicures, sterilized and wrapped implements, and they even cut their buffers into individually sized 1" squares to avoid any cross contamination.    The vibe of the salon is really great.  Downtempo, chillax if you will.  I do wish the esthetician and the nail tech also took pride in their hair so that they could be a cross referral system to the stylists in the salon.    Not that this affects the service I received, but one of the stylists came to work totally unprepared.  She had to borrow gloves from Leticia and a foiling comb from another hairdresser to do her first client.  They were a kind and supportive team, but I can tell they rent because everyone has different branded items they were using...thus making the sacrifice from them beyond gracious.   Thanks for an AWESOME morning.  Loved my service and can't wait to come back on business.

It's never my intention to harm a local business, but this place blows. Nothing is current.  (Unless you want faded black business casual pants.)  Again, discounts aren't done by date, which is sad considering it's the best way to keep the merchandise moving and in season.   The owner is very nice and positive. Maybe you can help her out by consigning good items with her?

I really don't think I could ask for more in a breakfast.  This place is hopping, but if you're dining alone, they'll do their best to scoot you into the bar amongst the other solo travelers.  I ordered chicks and something: two eggs, hash or home fries, sausage or bacon, and your choice of yum-yum bread with homemade preserves.  I took mine: poached, hashed, patties, and wheat with extra butter and the strawberry preserve.     Staff was attentive, I didn't feel rushed in spite of the congregating line in the courtyard, and the food came fast.  Lots of happy people and smiles.  If I could change just one thing...the coffee is a bit weak for my tastebuds and they make their iced coffee by pouring hot coffee over ice (no-thank-you!).  And if I could change two things, I would recommend that the hashbrowns be cold water washed before frying - this allows them to crisp and prevent that gooey middle that mine came with.  Other then that: bliss.

The baby wants all things bread, and can I blame him that doughnuts also make the top of this list?!  The base dough of this place is so good, it doesn't need any of those toppings.  But as it was, whatever you order will be ready for you in about 10 second.    I got the one topped with bacon and called it breakfast.  Just make sure you have a wetnap or eat near the fountains so you can wash the fingers after noshing.

I'm from the east coast, and back east we don't spread the love like they do here.  It was my first visit and Cali took precious time to ask me about my day, my necklace, my pregnancy - and then she made custom recommendations for my morning brew and nosh.  I ended up with the most delicious decaf red tea latte and a croissant with nuttella.  Awesome space, great for doing work or lounging and eating your yum yum breakfast!
