This is our go-to Chinese Take Out place. My husband gets the General Tsos Chicken and I get the Orange Chicken extra spicy. So good! I love love love their pork fried rice, always order it without onions and it's perfect every time. I usually pick it up since it's literally 2 minutes from my house, but when we are super lazy and get delivery it's very fast. Their online ordering is great too because I can type in all my picky-eater instructions and they are followed every time. Good prices.

HIDDEN GEM! This is my new go-to place! Got my first amazing Gel Manicure here today and I LOVE IT! Mary did my nails, she was such a sweetheart, I can't wait to go back and see her again. I was AMAZED at what you get for only $20. ($25 total with tip) She soaked my hands, cut all of my cuticles off, filed and shaped my nails, smoothed/buffed them out, then started polishing away! After my nails were completely done I got an amazing arm/hand massage with lotion. Fabulous! They had a good color selection, which I am super excited about. They are open 7 days a week, which is awesome, til about 6 or 7 I believe. I do recommend an appointment as I am sure this place gets booked up quickly. I went on a Sunday at 11:30 (with appointment) had NO WAIT and it took a little over an hour.  Seriously, great place. I am excited to get my hair cut and colored there as well. Prices are too good to be true! I spoke with Lanny (maybe the owner?) and they do ombre hair color, so I am getting that next :) Can't wait to see how that turns out! There was a family that came in with children, so I assume they do great with kids as well.
