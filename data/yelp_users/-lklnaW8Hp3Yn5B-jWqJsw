Went here with my bride to celebrate our 20th anniversary. Sunset view was 5 star. Everything else was a 2. The lamb I ordered was burned on top. My wife's $40 filet mignon came with no sides so she ordered fries that came out cold and crispy. We had to ask for water refills 3 three times. What a let down.

Pretty bad. I would only recommend to someone who's had too much to drink and needs something too absorb the alcohol. And even then, pay for plenty of extra sauce to make it palatable. I had the #1combo: fish, shrimp and fries. Gag!

I knew I was dealing with a pro when Randy was able to locate the problem within 60 seconds of me pointing and explaining in layman's terms about the gusher coming from my aged sprinkler system. An hour later he had replaced the problem lines and fixed the leak. I'm sure I will recoup what I paid for the repair in savings on my water bill.

Great service and high quality glass installed in my driveway at home the day after I called. They worked everything out with my insurance company so I paid nothing out of pocket. I would definitely use them again and feel comfortable recommending them to anyone.

I was in Charlotte for business and tried out the Harbor Inn based on good reviews on Yelp and my craving for seafood. I tried the fried (as in deep) seafood platter and was quickly won over by the flavor. The platter included fish, crab, shrimp, clam, scallops and fries.  Calorie counters should probably stay away from this place. You could have gained a pound or two just by being exposed to the aroma of my meal. My only let down was that there was no bar where solo diners can have a beer and watch tv while eating, so I took my meal back to the hotel. I will definitely go back and would recommend it to others.

As good as the high-priced place we used to go when we had vision insurance. With all the add-ons the other place got us for, I actually think we spend less at America's Best, even without insurance.

When the stars line up in your favor, I hope you find yourself at Fuzzy's on Taco Tuesday in between rushes, like I did today. Local's tip: pork soft taco. Thank me later!

I really can't believe this just happened. Within two hours of my daughter cracking the screen on her iPhone she had a new one installed in our home on a Sunday night for about half of what it would have cost to get it done at the Apple store - a place I dread going to. Thanks, Cory!

Won't be back. Made the mistake of going here for dinner with my wife, thinking it was a legit Chinese restaurant. It's more like a bar that happens to serve run of the mill Chinese food. Saw no Asians working or dining here. This is not legit Chinese. Bland seasonings. Texture of the chicken led us to believe it was processed, maybe even precooked and frozen.

I used to think franchised BBQ can't be good. then Dickeys came to town and proved me wrong. I eat here often since I work just a few blocks away. Its always good! I dare you to walk anywhere near the place and not get hungry. The aroma of smoke and meat wafts in the air. Try it and you'll be hooked like I am.

Less than 24 hours from my call to clean carpets. I called after receiving a coupon in the mail. They honored the price and didn't try any bait and switch tactics. Marvin did a fantastic job not only in cleaning our carpet but also in convincing me he was a pro from the outset. Great people skills and mannerisms! He didn't try to upsell any add-ons when I mentioned we're planning on replacing the carpet in the next 6 months or so. He gave me some pro tips on carpet purchase and installation. He did ask when we last had the tile grout cleaned. When I said we're planning on getting it cleaned after fixing a few broken tiles, he gave me an estimate on the spot to fix the tiles and clean the grout. When I told him I already had a quote to fix the tile for about half what he quoted, he suggested I get it fixed them call him for the grout clean because he knows his price can't be beat for that. Glad I took a chance with Sears and will I will be scheduling the grout clean with him soon.

Went here for the first time tonight and I will definitely be back. Seafood and BBQ are on the top of my list of likes and they do them both great here. My friend and I teamed up to order apps and combos that included bbq pork, clams, calamari, cod and shrimp plus three tasty sides. Both of us were thoroughly impressed with all of it. The atmosphere was very comfortable too. I look forward to going back again and again till I've tried everything in the menu, especially for springtime lunch on the patio before a spring training game.
