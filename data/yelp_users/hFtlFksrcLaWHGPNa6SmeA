yup, this place is awesome! I finally went yesterday and here's what I got for $78 plus a free bag of treats  -big bag of chicken jerky -TiGi shampoo for curly haired pups - a comb - breath freshener - puppy diapers(my sister will only babysit my dogs if they wear these, lol!)  -and a huge economic pack of pee pads.   Here is everything my friend got for $180 plus free bag of treats  - dog crate(75 pound dog) - new toys - huge bones/rawhide - the long stick thing that throws the balls for you, i dont know the name lol - economy size shampoo - economy pack of beggin strips - breath freshener - brush and comb - 6ft leash -food and water bowl   they only get four stars bc the hours are super difficult, we had to schedule time off work to go (they close at 4 and aren't open on weekends), and because the prices aren't listed on anything so you have to constantly flip through this huge catalog to find prices. but, it is so worth it, especially if you have big items to purchase.

I really dig the rhythm room! I went to a concert here on Monday night.   it was cute. it was quaint. it was CLEAN. great bartenders, love the option to sit or to stand.   the sound guy was a bit off and im pretty sure my ear is still ringing from the high pitched squeel when the microphones got too close to the speaker or something. but hey, it happens i guess.   i had a blast at this sweet little spot.

am i the only one who thinks pottery barn has gone down hill? pottery barn has never been my style to begin with, every now and then i find things i like but there's something country about it and i don't like country.   anyway.   the quality is not what it used to be. and the service is farrrr from good.   just today i was accused of being dishonest because i wanted to return some crappy plates that were falling apart.   "are you sure it's not just normal wear and tear? we have a lot of people trying to return stuff so they can have brand new dishes before the holidays."  "um, that most certainly is not me and im offended you would insinuate i'm trying to do that"  "im not insinuating anything ma'am."   "really? then why say it?"  i expect this sorta crap from target but im totally shocked pottery barn is hopping on the crappy customer service wagon.   let me get this straight: you sell me borderline expensive crap, i complain about the crap and want to return it, instead of standing behind your product and taking care of your customer, you suggest that a lot of people are dishonest when they return stuff but i shouldn't take offense?   the problem is not me, its you and your crappy dishes.   i won't be returning.

i love this restaurant so much. i have yet to have something i didn't like.  i have nothing really special to add to all of the amazing reviews except to order these things:  thai steak noodle salad- mango, avocado, tomatoes, noodles, marinated steak...i meannnnnnnnnnnnn caesar salad - their dressing is my fav and so are the croutons bacon, cheddar burger- so juicy, so exquisite roast beef sandwich- raw horseradish on the side fries- order extra bc people will eat these babies UP!    service is ALWAYS good, it's always clean, it's always pleasant. seriously, you can't have a bad time unless you're just a miserable person.

WOW, not what i was expecting. I never go into Ross bc usually they are so gross... but last night I found out they're open until 9:30 and I needed a new pillow so i got out my pepper spray and made my way in.  I should probably only be giving this place 3 stars because the line was long and tags were missing on several people's items so people had to keep waiting for price checks. BUT they definitely earned that 4th star bc it was clean and organized.    My guess is that they just did a complete organization and cleaning of the store and tags got lost in the process. I can put up with that if it means having a great Ross!    this was seriously an organized ross- i've never seen that happen. And everything was displayed nicely?! What?!   I went in for a new pillow and left w a mothers day present, a sweet vase, the coolest hanging tea light holder, a shirt, and ralph lauren pillow.   how much did i spend? $35.   did I feel dirty and ghetto after I left? nope.   Hive fives and thumbs up for this location of Ross

I was referred to fresh cut romance and it was one of the easiest and best decisions i made last week.  i needed the arrangement to be simple, elegant, chic, urban, funky, modern, fun, classy and whatever weird adjective popped into my head at the time. it needed to be small with a $40 price point.   I went in that afternoon and  told the awesome girl working there those exact words along with the occassion for the flowers. i was literally only there for about 2 minutes and i could tell she just understood what ever gibberish was coming from my mouth. she 'got' me.  she said it would be ready by 5 and that i could pick it up same day. my hero.   I showed up at 5 and i think it was the owner  working there now, and she said, "are you samantha?" wow! they keep on top of it! then she walked to the fridge and pulled out the most gorgeous chic arrangement and they stayed in the price point. they were able to read my mind and then some!   exactly how a florist should be!   We chatted it up for a while and she was seriously so awesome. I will definitely be returning for all my floral needs. You can see the final product in the pictures. I brought it to dinner and everyone was like, 'wow! i had no idea there was a florist in AZ who could create something so modern!'

I don't know why I always shop around bc I know Pruitts will have the best price. I wish they had a better website.

I can't get over how much cheaper they are!! I did the same thing where I went to a ton of different spots shopping for furniture and ended up with the best deals at Pruitts.   This update is about their hold policy, I love it! I move into my house in 1 month so I took advantage of their layway. You pay 10% of the cost and they hold it for up to 3 months. If you change your mind, it doesn't fit right, or anything- you get your money back!   Also, Ashley Furniture currently has a bedroom and office set that I love, Pruitt's doesn't carry it but looked into the price to order it for me. Pruitt's is getting it to me for less than I can directly from Ashley.   I LOVE Pruitts.   PS- they currently have a 3 piece cherry queen sleighbed special for $500! and I got my 7 piece formal dining set for a whopping $800. I dare you to try and beat it.   I will be buying my new king bedroom furniture, new mattress, dining set, and office set from Pruitts, they will deliver and set up everything for $50.  my current couch, swivel love seat thing, and mattress are from pruitts as well. love them and had them for a few years now w no probs.   *update- i added pics of the furniture in the new place, it goes great wherever you go and it's sturdy enough to make it through a move, haha. excuse the messy boxes*

i should have walked out the moment i walked in.  duck taped massage chairs???   creepy chairs lined agains the wall with fans at the feet?   we were told pedicures were $20 but they failed to mention the ridiculous $2 upcharge if you pay with a debit or credit card.   it was so hot in there, too. they need to turn on the ac.   it was awful. never again.

"it's just past castle boutique but if you reach le girls you've gone too far"  hahhahah!   I have lived here for almost 3 years and I really like it. I have noticed that the quality of people has gone down a bit and the neighbors are more hillbilly-ish/hoodlum.   I am in the process of buying my first home and hopefully they don't give me any crap when I leave.  I think alicia covered everything pretty perfectly, and i definitely recommend living here. one thing that i will add about hating this place is they come to your apt a couple times a year to check the smoke alarm and filters. I guess that comes with renting? but i don't like people coming into my home when I'm not there.   i posted some pics of the interior on my review of pruitt's furniture- check them out if you'd like to see the inside of the 1b1b :)

this only gets two stars because it was pure entertainment and I got in for free.  I saw people leaving with bags full of stuff and after walking the entire park all I could think was "what in the WORLD could they have seriously bought?!"   It was a bunch of the most random junk. I think Bacon B put it best "crazy crap and useless garbage" but in a good way, you know? it's totally worth the 2 dollar entry fee if nothing more than the entertainment or most bizarre browsing ever :)

i used to try and skip school by saying my backpack was too heavy so i needed to see dr. k before class.   really, i just wanted a nice back crack, a mini icy hot massage and extra sleep time on his heated, vibrating water beds.

i can't write this without sounding like a horrible infomercial so i'm just going to go with it.   i got in a car accident that left me ridiculously broken. like, i had a walker and my sister had to dress me. no freaking lie.   anyway, i was desperate and in so much pain i was begging all my friends to share their narcotics with me. i tried going to a different chiro closer to me but he didn't feel comfortable working on me because my back was that bad. he wanted me to wait a bit longer. UHHH NOT POSSIBLE. the thought of having to wait even longer to get relief was not an option so i called my main man, dr. k, to see if he could squeeze me in.  the great thing about dr kasian is he's been doing this and knows what he's doing. he is gentle but not afraid to dive in and fix what's broken. my sister drove me to his office and after a few shouts and tears, he adjusted me and i started to get better. it's been 3 weeks and i just had my last appointment. i am soooooo much better!! no more cane or walker.   he even offered to let me come by and use his heated, vibrating waterbeds anytime i want. love that guy!

this place tastes like high school :)  gone are the days of actually waking up early enough to get ready someplace other than in my car, but to actually want to make time to stop and get coffee.   everytime I go to my parents I make a stop here.  i recommend everything. I always add soymilk- some employees don't charge for it and some do. I say flash them a few smiles, it will increase your chances for free soy. unless you're a guy- no soy for you. i heard it can create moobs and, well, i want to prevent you from developing moobs.   I love their version of the caramel machiatto. it's the best i've ever had.  Seattle Espresso is sorta like 'if you give a mouse a cookie' in that if you give me a latte then i'll want to stop in hobby lobby or target. and if i go to hobby lobby expect me to disappear for a long time and i will ask to borrow someones hot glue gun. you get the idea.

I like this location better than the one in Scottsdale, I think the staff is way friendlier.   I don't really think it's worth eating actual dinner here, in my eyes it's only good for cheese and chocolate courses.   BUT do be sure to sign up for their mailing list, I have gotten some AWESOME deals.

I drive all the way to Ahwatukee for this salon. Best manicure/pedicure.   it is insanely clean, everything is new, the chairs are some of the best. they don't vibrate- they actually massage into your shoulders. and they always play kool jazz. it makes me feel like a kid stuck in my step dads car all over again. only...in a good way. ok, so they don't correlate. whatever.   i always nearly pass out, and so does everyone i go with. so relaxing. and you leave feeling like a million bucks.    My only complaint is they speak vietnamese in front of clients and I think that's tacky...but it's pretty hard to escape at most salons

can we have a moment of silence for the carnitas street tacos?  let's pay our respect for the carne asada.   what is the secret ingredient in those beans?? i can't pin point it but those beans are something else.   we wanted to try it all, so naturally, it was the 3 item combo platter: 1 taco, 1 tamale, 1 enchilada.   the friendliest girl told us they were known for street tacos and we should have listened. everything on the plate was great but it was all about that taco.   i thought i knew delicious but it reached a whole 'notha level after eating here.   my recommendation: street taco combo plate w carne asada and DEFINITELY carnitas. then drizzle on some of that green salsa they have. welcome to bliss.  they are a tad inconsistent but it's still really good, some days are just off the charts goods.

Congrats to Dr. D and the team! They just won Best of 2011 for best of Ortho AND best cusomer service. When you go here, you'll understand why.   Also, Dr. D was the only orthodontist selected from the US to attend a round table discussion and product planning meeting for future ortho products. He's pretty awesome if you can't tell yet.   I L-O-V-E Dr. D and EVERY SINGLE ONE of his staff members! I can't even begin to list everything amazing about them, they are top of the line in technology, friendliness, and overall amazingness. They give tokens to the kids which can be redeemed for gift cards, not even going to lie, I participated in the token thing when I had my braces :)   His service is affordably do-able bc they will assit anyone with a payment plan if necessary. Dr. Dan really cares about getting patients to have beautiful teeth. He's also pretty hot...so that's always a plus.   The consultation is free so just check it out, you have nothing to lose. They also have two locations now, the other in Gilbert, so now you can go to the location most convenient for you.   If you have kids, they have a bus that will pick your kids up from school for their appointment and drop them back off or whatever schedule you work out with them for rides making it more convenient for you.   They accomodate in so many ways it's unreal.  You'll also find yourself jealous of kids with braces because they get to visit with the staff on a regular basis still!

i'm pretty sure robin williams was staying in our room right before we arrived bc our room was covered in pubic hair.  there was a dirty, pubic hair filled towel hanging up in our bathroom our sheets had pubes everywhere the walls were filthy with black stains (see pic)   the life guards are so intense. i felt like i was getting yelled at the whole time and i wasn't even doing anything. they just feel like shouting about the rules constantly. total kill-joys.  the breakfast buffet was actually surprisingly goodand the customer service was wonderful, the staff is super friendly.   special shout out to their pillows. amazing pillows.   i won't be back though.  ps...i originally gave this review 2 stars until the hilarious Heather C. pointed out the below. she is so right! and i can't stop laughing.   "Didn't you read the Yelp guidelines?  Pubes = 1 star no matter how great everything else is!!!!  You've just told the world, "yeah, the pubes were okay, but I've had better."   hahahahaha

I went here the day i found out i had vertigo. true story. it's now part of my history.   i woke up and instantly thought 'did i get drunk last night and i dont remember?'  not the case, i had to have my mom pick me up and if i remember correctly i had to scoot down the 3 flights of apartment stairs so that i wouldn't fall. if only someone recorded that and put it on youtube...  anywho, after the dr. said it was vertigo causing my issues, i got to go home but i was hungry and wanted a sandwich. all of the nurses said to go here. so my mom drove me and bought me lunch. :)   the turkey is some of the best i have had!! they seriously packed the sandwich so thick with layers of divine turkey. they had a sandwich related to thanksgiving and i need to try it, and lots of goodies from the east coast that we don't typically see in az. i will totes be back.

roll, roll, roll your joint. twist it at the end. take one puff, that's enough. pass it to a friend.   ya sonnnn, i love this place. that song gets stuck in my head every time i go to cheba hut... the same way the jingle bells gets stuck in my head during christmas. i'm festive that way.   i like the chicken with marinara on garlic herb. i add black olives, parm and oregano.   ya son.   then i top it off with a bite of one of their crazy rice krispy treats- reeces puffs, coco krispies and cinnamon toast crunch joined together by holy matrimony (aka marshmellow cream) is my idea of the perfect cereal  menage a' trois. those weird little kelloggs elves have NOTHING on the cheebs concoctions.   i love people watching here, is everyone high except for me? the employees are so nice. i genuinely think they care when they ask me how my day is. so sincere. and they ask for my ID, so thumbs up on preventing theft.   however, since im the only sober person there i have noticed the dust bunnies accumulating on their toaster. time to dust.

I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.  All I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.  NO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?  Everything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous.   I don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?

so everyone was talking about these carvel cakes and asking about locations. I always drive by this schlotzkys and see the little carvel sign. I had a bad experience with the beyond disgusting carvel cakes from the grocery store and pretty much decided that it was just a nasty, poor quality product.   well, i got over myself and decided to try it, and oh man it was good!!! it was thicker than frozen yogurt but not as solid as ice cream and the flavors were rich. I had the small swirl in the waffle cone and it was huge! the waffle cone was not as good as cold stone but it was sweet and crunchy and still totally delicious. i am totally a fan. i will just have to stay away from the gross grocery store cakes.   try it!  and as far as schlotzkys? i like the original w no mustard and their pizzas.

i hadn't been to valle luna since i was a kid, but we went here recently and it was so great.   i mean, it wasn't like amazing mexican homemade food, but it's pretty darn good for what it is.   their salsa is amazing. so amazing. the chips are warm and salty. the bean dip is pretty great.   for a meal, their chicken fundido is awesome if you're feeling naughty.   i had the fajitas and everything was fresh, not pre-made. you know how i have a weird thing about pre-made food. nope, not here. they were even able to cook my fajitas with water instead of oil which was a bonus for me because i make crazy requests like that.   we sat on the patio and enjoyed the water fountain. all in all, it was good and i'd totally go back.

sadly, i can't let my old review stand. i hope no one went there based on that review. idk what happened butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this last time was not good.   the beans on my friends plate looked like dried out play-do. it was really gross to look at from across the table, not gonna lie. and the lettuce on her plate was brown and wilty. i couldn't handle it.   my food had this weird flavor and honestly....  everything had a weird taste, even my diet coke.  we both agreed everything had a funny taste. idk what it was. i was sad bc last time my dinner was so amazing. i probably won't be going back for awhile. or ever, i haven't decided.

when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.  well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY.   it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...  our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'  then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.  i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird.   we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.   as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing.   awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.   if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.

literally...so many times i have thought 'should i drive all the way to chandler to eat this?'  i found this place while playing third wheel to my best friend, meg, and her boyfriend, adam. we wanted chinese food so i got to searching for something cheap near their house.  adam chimes in mocking yelp 'how many spoons does it have, sam?! if it only has a 3 spoon rating we're not going!'  we arrived to see this tiny, upbeat asian man rocking the house. he seriously holds the fort down and he is funny. and adorable.   we took our food to-go and started tasting all of the treats we brought home. holy smokes this food was the business.   we got the noodles with the chicken as well as the chicken with the mushrooms. the old guy recommended both. i was expecting mediocre food considering the price and the hole in the wall-ness of it. but this is sooooooo goooooooddddd.  i'm pretty sure it's horrible for you so thankfully it's pretty far from me. but anytime i'm over there, we eat here.   make fun of yelp again, adam! you're going to start worshiping the yelp gods (and ME!) for finding you this delicacy.

My review is about Mark who works at this location.  I have had my Mac for a year and half and my iphoto is bugging the crap out of me bc it creates a different roll for every single picture.   well, i didn't want to go in the store to fix it and was determined to use the support option on their website. I didn't know how to title my issue to look it up so I called.  I was lucky enough (im being sarcastic) to talk to Mark. I told him my problem and he continuously did not listen to me. then when he realized that I do not have leopard on my mac he laughed and was like "oh that is so old you would be lucky to find someone who knows how to fix that, you're going to have to come in for step by step instructions."  (UHHH?! my computer is under 2 years old not from 1990)  ok, so he was obviously not listening, i wanted to know what to call my problem to look it up on my own.  I got a lil bitchy and took his name and got off the phone and called biltmore.

katie and i went here on sunday before an ikea trip.  let me start off by saying we were seriously starving, i was so pumped to order my jerk chicken salad. we walk in and theres a 'bloody mary bar' and it looked absolutely disgusting. i alsmot lost my appetite by being greeted by that filthy mess of a germ bar.    i sat down while katie used the restroom and i ordered us water and myself a drink.   katie and i sat talking for a bit and i asked, "are you going to get a drink?" "ya, if he ever comes back" was her response  then i realized it had been 10 minutes before we saw our waiter again. finally, he came around and tried to make us order chips. we were so hungry we almost did but passed them up. we ordered our food, it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad, instead i opted for a breakfast dish. and let me just say breakfast is not their strong point.   another 15 or so minutes go by and we can't take it so we order chips.   then we notice everyone around us is eating corn bread. HEY WHERE'S OUR CORNBREAD?!?! we don't need chips and salsa, we're supposed to get cornbread!   so our waiter passes by us again so we ask/shout for cornbread.  then, not even lying, our food, chips and salsa, and cornbread come to the table all at once. so overwhelming  the chips and salsa were not good.  my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada.  if you eat here, stick to the jerk chicken salad(one of the best salads ive ever had) or the spicy chicken pasta which is perfectly spicy.  2 stars for service 2 stars for food on this trip(usually i would give it 4) 2 stars for sunday morning ambiance(dinner is the time to go here)

I used to be obsessed with this little hole in the wall of a gem, Espos. They have the best green chili burro I have ever had.   ...that was until one day I picked up an order and was filling my drink waiting for them to bag it up. On the soda fountain you won't believe what I saw...  it was COVERED in cock roaches. Big ones and baby ones. They were crawling all throughout the machine. When I told the lady in the window she said "Oh, I am sorry about that, would you like a bottled beverage?"  UH NO! I would like you to freak out a little bit and sound somewhat shocked and FIX IT!!!!!   I alerted the better business bureau about that. I am sure it has been fixed but I don't think I'll ever be able to go back without gagging.   So be on alert for creepy crawlies while you're there..

I'm disappointed in myself for not getting dessert or iced coffee, but i needed room for food. I think that should be an entire separate trip because the food was too good to stop myself.   I even got to spot a little local celeb while there. Mr. Bianco himself. I tried to be sly and peek at what he was eating so that I could order it. You know it's good if he's eating it, right?! All I could tell was that it was a pressed sandwich for anyone curious. And I think he caught on to me being ridiculous because he started smiling. Or he wants to date me, in which case HAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY ;)  During my wonderful trip to Liberty I got to taste the hummus, sweet potato salad, pizza, the picnic sandwich, and the caprese sandwich.  first things first, i am going to spend now until november trying to make  that sweet potato salad. it was insanity. It was roasted and I could taste the garlic and there were craisins and oh my gosh. I need to figure out how to make it so that I can take credit for it at thanksgiving dinner. with respect to liberty of course :)  second- how the heck can i pick a favorite between balsamic drizzled bread with ripe, red tomatoes, tons of fresh basil, divine mozarella or the turkey with bleu cheese crumbles, granny apple slices, and candied pecans? both sandwiches were so amazing. my eating companion and i decided that the caprese sandwich was the winner. so amazing. but that doesn't discount how awesome the picnic is, because that is amazing in it's own right.   i've already figured out my next trip. instead of ordering two entrees and switching halves with the other diner, we will order and split only one entree, one side and then we will have room for dessert.   or i'll just go in and order a ton of desserts. whatever.

Bank of America was my first bank after switching from a credit union. I banked with them for a couple years. a few months after I turned 18 they told me in the branch that I was approved for a student credit card to be used for overdraft protection. I thought that was great bc I was still learning to balance a checkbook and hardly ever had more than $200 in my account at a time. I filled out all the paper work and the teller said it would be applied right away as a back up.  Well, that didn't happen. I overdrafted several times thinking it would pull it from my card and ended up with almost $300 in overdraft fees.   I went into the bank and they had no idea what I was talking about with that student credit card, and had no record of my paperwork or even saying that i would like them to open it.    she then explained to me that my paper work have been misplaced. this is when i freaked out.  THEY MISPLACED my social, my address, name everything for anyone to be able to steal my identity. they have no record of ever having it and said i should be fine bc it was probably shredded if it was found. ya, not if a criminal found it!   I then had to put a bunch of red flags on my social so that no one could do anything with my name or ss#.   They wouldn't waive any of the fees bc they didn't think it was their fault. I paid them off and switched banks and i will never bank with them for anything ever again.

here's a 5 star for chizonas. I had their chicago dog and oh my gosh it was so good!!! the bun, the dog, the toppings, YUM!   their fries are awesome too.   and the guy working was so awesome!!!  someone was having spaghetti and that looked amazing so i will probably have to try it.   ps- single ladies, if you're lookin for a man come here during lunch. i was the only lady there. it was a man cave.

i have yet to order something that i have disliked.  my favorite is the thai steak noodle salad- it's a must order. the only time i was disappointed was when i discovered their salsa was just Pace from a jar.   AND the service is ALWAYS great. They stand behind the quality of their food and if it's below standard, they will take care of you! I always look forward to going to Houston's.

This place is seriously a treasure shop. some people hate how cluttered it is but it's one of the reasons i LOVE it. they have SO much to see! it kinda reminds me of one of my trips to NYC where we dedicated an entire day to consignment shops. teeny tiny little places with SO so many things to oooo and ahhh over. and sometimes an ew. BUT, thats what makes it so great!   there are gobs and gobs of jewelry- some costume, some vintage, some fake, some real.  then all of the handbags are cluttered together and hung up where the lady working the counter will tell you all about them. she can also tell you which she believes are real and which are def fakes.  then the shoes are just in rows lining the entire store.    when you're done with that its time to squeeze through all of the rounders stuff full of clothes. so many high end labels! i found the cutest dolce and gabbana top once. they also have jeans but they tend to be on the uglier side. there is a rounder of furs and even a 'fancy' section packed full of sequined 80s wear!   it is always a hit, never a miss. you are bound to find something you must have!  even if it's just a handful of amazing jewels. i added a picture of a sweet clutch i found made by neiman marcus's brand.

I LOVE z gallerie.   1. they're inexpensive 2. great customer service 3. unique pieces 4. amazing sales 5. great online shopping 6. sweet quality  I can't get enough of z gallerie. I only enter when I have spending money, otherwise I would go broke or eat peanut butter and beans until the next pay check.

I only shop the sales because I can't convince myself to spend that much on clothes and bc their sales are amazing so there isn't even a need to pay full price.   each item of clothing is unique and can pretty much be dressed up for a chic work outfit or dressed down for weekend wear.   I think they have the cutest dresses, too. and pants and tops  and ok everything is cute.  the kids clothes are adorable too.  not a fan of the home items bc it's a little too, i cant find the word, but not my thang. kitchy maybe?

I looooooove laser 4 less! if you're questioning whether or not you should do it, you should.   Really clean, really professional and, I mean, it's not *that* painful. It's totally worth the momentary pain.   I did quite a few consultations with other companies and this one offered everything the others did but for much less. I'm cheap like that.    I had my last session like 2 yrs ago and my last touch up a year ago and I haven't had to go back. I want to do my whole body!!! It's sooo wonderful!!  just keep in mind: the darker and thicker your hair the better.

I flipping love sub factory. I used to eat these subs every day and tonight I found their frequent punch card in my wallet. I've had it since high school. I totally plan on eating these subs again, I forgot all about it!   My order:  Turkey on white with onions and banana peppers and provolone. sometimes lettuce.   The turkey is shaved very thin and it's piled on! the bread is so chewy and perfect.   The onions are sliced very very thin as well and it makes them so easy to eat!   Seriously, I LOVE sub factory. Definitely get an otis cookie while you're there, too.   I always see cops and business men whenever I go in, the space is small but clean with quite a bit of sitting space.

this is basically the only pizza i eat. it's best when it's extra extra hot. their homemade salad dressings are so yummy. and their marinara is perfect- i could eat it like soup. don't laugh, you would too!

this location gives Marshall's a bad name.   a friend and I were in the mood for some great deals and we both decided we 'needed' new shoes. I said let's try Marshall's! It's usually better than Ross or TJ and the biggest one I know of in the valley is at AZ Mills.   We got there around 7:30 or 8pm after dinner and about 20 minutes before closing we had to use the restroom REALLY bad (FYI- eating low carb candy before a shopping trip is a VERY bad idea, read the warning label on those low-carb snacks) anywho...... they did not have a restroom for us to use but instead gave us directions to the closest one.   At this point we had 2 shopping carts EACH filled with fantastic finds(a lot more than the pair of shoes we went in for) and had already become so attached that we didn't feel comfortable leaving our carts just anywhere thinking someone would try to steal our  hot items or put them away.  so we kindly asked if we could place our carts behind the counter or right next to it while we rushed to the bathroom.   the girl gave me one of THE nastiest looks ever and said "um no". surprised by her rudeness, i got a little bit of an attitude and said "UM then where do you want me to put them?!?!"  she rolled her eyes again, "fine, leave them here." and off to the bathroom we ran.   we got back about 5-10 minutes before closing(i used to work in retail so i know how annoying it is when customers come before close but we were done shopping and just wanted to pay). 5-10 minutes was just enough time for us to do that anyway. so we came back in and the girls working there were so nasty with us. they were complaining out loud while we waited in line about how much they hate when people come in as they're closing and out loud said "don't they have any damn respect?" i knew AZ mills was ghetto....  I just ignored them but my friend pretty much told them to shut their dirty little mouths because they weren't even closed yet. if the deals we found weren't so awesome we would have left but we bought our stuff and neither one of us will ever return. our business is obviously wanted and appreciated elsewhere.  this place makes me want to say really bad words!!!!!!!

This gym has spoiled me. They have all the right classes at all the right times. even when it's packed, there's always an open machine. sometimes there's a wait for the weight machines. the  locker rooms are always super clean. and the staff is just awesome. totally worth the $50 membership!

I am going to have to take the unpopular side on this.   i was not impressed. I had the fry bread with the green chile. It had lettuce and cheese on it, too.   so dull and bland. the fried bread was too much and the green chile was totally lacking flavor.  I felt like it needed salt or something.  I had a taste of the dessert fry bread w powdered sugar and honey and well...i don't get it. it tastes like regular old carnival fry bread to me. it's yummy but not worth driving here for.   I was really hoping the fry bread taco things would be super yummy but not so much :(

I finally made it to sweet cakes. i had my nieces with me and i like to buy their love, so what better way to buy love than with cookies?!?    you can probably buy my love with cookies, too. i love cookies.   i love cookies so much that i will even fall for the 'sugar free' gimmick pillsbury cookie dough when im dieting. everytime. i think- 'maybe i didn't make them right last time, i should try it again.' ya, it's really hard to make slice and bake cookies.... and by 'slice' i mean 'already cut into perfect round cookie dough bits that just need to be placed on a cookie sheet'. and for the record, the sugar free cookies taste like BBQ'ed plastic.  i also love cookies so much that i will go out to dinner with friends to oreganos. not a fan of oreganos, but i will replace dinner with a pizookie no problem. because what's better than a half raw piping hot fresh cookie?   nothing. which is why we took home a tub of  sweet cakes chocolate chip cookie dough and made the best freakin cookies. only after eating a scoop of raw cookie dough first, of course.   the raw cookie dough is some of the best. if you go the tub route be sure to save some cookie dough for raw eating pleasure.  the cooked cookies were amazing and the tub will last me for far too long- but on second thought, there is no such thing as too long when it is regarding cookies.   there are so many things i want to do with that tub of delightful cookie dough(homemade vanilla ice cream with cookie dough pieces anyone?). you need to experience this for yourself.

The first time I came here, they had no mirrors or fittings rooms.  We were literally the girls trying on clothes on top of our clothes in the middle of the store and then checking out our reflections in the windows. yup, we're *those* kinda people.  obviously, it was hysterical. we decided to go back this past weekend and it was amazing.   most of the stuff is off brands, or cheap throw away brands, but every now and then there's something a notch up. i got an american apparrel v neck for $2.99, an old navy t shirt for $1.99 and a random no-name but super cute maxi dress for $6.99.   they had a TON of super cute things this past weekend- white, high waisted, CUTE pants for $3.99, a ton of summery dresses, skirts, tons of camis, rompers, etc. a TON of the stuff looks super cheap, but there are a TON of decent pieces not made of polyester.  we immediately got to work trying clothes over our clothes and taking pics of each other with our phones since we knew they didn't have mirrors.   that was until the security guard came up to us laughing mid-picture pose, "um ladies, you do know there is a mirror over there, right?"  hahahaha!  he definitely thought we were nuts.   my friend would probably kill me if i showed this picture of her but it's too funny not to show you. seriously, it makes me pee my pants so i'm posting it. it was in the middle of me saying 'this looks so bad, you have camel toe, i have to take a picture' hense the crotch grab.  you're welcome.   I walked out of there spending less than $15. my gf got like 2 dresses, 3 skirts, tons of camis, and a few other pieces and she spent less than $40.   they have a TON of cute, name brand kids/baby clothes for the sweet $1.99 prices as well.. and mens clothes too.    and if you're feeling sexy they have the craziest lingerie as well. check out the pics!   have fun! it's hit or miss but almost always hit. just don't expect the employees or the registers to work fast. they are all stuck in the 90s...employees and the registers. :)   we also decided this is THEEEEEE place for halloween shopping. some of the stuff is SO crazy.

ya, im one of THOSE girls. you know, the kind that can't change her oil, flat tires, headlights, you get the picture.   i use AAA on a pretty regular basis and today it was the funeral of my battery.   I was sipping my sonic happy hour iced tea, listening to the radio while enjoying the cooler weather and my eventless saturday. Then i got bored of that, so i decided to take my tea home. but my car wouldn't start. what the hay!?!    thankfully, AAA was on my speed dial and they set me up with a 30 minute time frame. but im pretty much VIP since I use them all the time and a battery truck came to my rescue in like 10 minutes. I don't know for sure if it's bc of my important, best customer of the year status that it came so quickly but it did and it's safe to assume it's bc they love me so much. and it's another reason why i love them- ALWAYS on time.  the knight in shining armor (aka dirty work pants and beat up battery truck) came to the conclusion that my battery was dying a slow death. but he had a spankin new one w a 3 year warranty and it was ready to go for a sweet little price.   he got rid of the old one, installed the new one, and i was on my way. so for the $70 or so yearly charge for AAA, all i can say is it is SO worth it.   thanks and see you again soon, triple a!

this place is hardcore overpriced. i would even beg to say the olive garden is tastier and cheaper.(for the record, i can enjoy the olive garden. the food quality matches the price)   I have eaten here a few separate occassions and have been 100% disappointed each time. maybe i have high expectations or something. especially when each meal is right around $15. I think their food is worth closer to $8 per meal. I would probably give it higher stars if the price was right, actually because the food isn't bad at all. just lacking when you put into account the total of your bill.  like seriously, $15 for fettuccine alfredo? i don't think so. it better be flipping bomb pasta and alfredo for that price.   and the chicken? what in the world is that? frozen tyson pieces? it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces. vom.   i will say that the service is really friendly and I like the location. but those two things alone would not convince me to go back. sorry to say but it's true.

I just moved in across the street from this amazing pet hospital. everyone here totally loves animals, you can tell. they talk in the sweetest voices to my puppies and are so gentle. i officially changed vets. my prior vet was great but it was soooo hard to get in! Bark Ave was able to get me in the day I called!!!! they make sure they have enough vets on staff so they can take calls and get people in right away, i love that! They also have some of the most flexible hours of any vet I have ever been to. Dr. Kasper is awesome and just a sweet heart. I love my new vet!!

normally, I hate chain restaurants. This Outback is the exception. I order their kid's meals to-go for lunch pretty often and Andrew is the best thing that could have happened to this Outback! And Angelina :)  One time, I was waiting for my to-go order to come while making calls for work when I realized almost an entire hour had gone by. I called just to get an update, not to complain or anything (thankfully I wasn't in a hurry).  The manager apologized and I guess something happened in the kitchen? I don't remember but when he came out with my food he didn't charge me and told me that he was going to take care of me the next visit. I was shocked!!! He did not need to do that but it was definitely something that set this chain above the rest.

i didn't have the same lame service as everyone else. my drinks were refilled frequently, we got an awesome spot on the patio and the weather couldn't have been better.   and the food, oh man!! the strawberry pancakes were amazing! we also ordered the monkey pancakes (banana, coconut, and almonds) and they were only so-so, I wouldn't order them again.  Their bacon was perfectly crispy. the only bummer is they were out of coffee soda which I have been wanting to try. Oh well, next time.  This place was super hard to find, it's in the actual scottsdale mall where they have all of the culture fests. we parked in the parking structure by los olivos.

SHC has the best, cleanest ER BUT if you get submitted to the hospital, it's the worst hospital ever!!   I won't bore you with the many complaints I had during my stay, but if you can avoid being submitted to this hospital, do whatever you can. Going back when I was being taken to the ER, I would have taken a longer trip if that meant I could have stayed at a better hospital. So just ONE of the BAJILLION complaints I have about this hospital is...  They are under staffed and the nurses are witches. After my surgery I had to pee (sorry if that's TMI) but I couldn't get to the bathroom on my own so I paged a nurse. NO ONE came around for an HOUR. Towards the end of that hour I was paging the nurses every two seconds. Still nada.   Finally, I grabbed my cell phone, called 411 and had them connect me with the hospital, I spoke with a receptionist and had to ask her if someone would please come to my room to help me. It was after that a nurse actually came to help me. Can you believe that??  There are a lot of elderly people in this part of town too and they probably would have just been left there to crap all over themselves or been ignored. If you have a grandparent or know an older person staying here, get them transferred.  other issues in the eyes of someone on pain meds: -they didn't toast my bagel and it made me cry. through tears i said to my sister, 'they didn't toast my bagel!!!' and then i'm pretty sure i through it on the floor. but that parts a bit blurry.  - they didn't knock before barging into my room in the middle of the night, which scared me and made me cry. through tears i said, 'can you please knock??!!'  issues not related to pain meds: - you have to share a room. yuck. my roommate was a farter. - the nurses are evil. they don't pay attention to the needles and tubes INSIDE of your SKIN when they go to take your blood pressure!! imagine having those ripped out of your arm bc the nurse isn't paying attention -in order to leave they make the head dr or nurse or something check you out. we waited 6 hours waiting for the nurse person while the nurses kept telling us to hold on, it should be soon. and then we found out it wasn't necessary and they finally let us leave.  - the nurses argue. see conversation below: "samantha- are you in pain? do you need more pain meds?' 'yes' 'you must not be in pain if you're sleeping' 'i'm not asleep' 'your eyes are closed' 'ummm, i'm responding aren't i? i'm not asleep' 'well if you were in pain it would be impossible for you to lay here calmly' 'can you please stop arguing with me? i am in pain so please stop arguing with me'

is it weird to be in love with a walgreens location? i consider this MY walgreens.  today i went and guess what- they have like mini dr. offices there to write prescriptions!!!!!! its my new favorite thing!!!!!!! its so hard to get in to see my doc so this totally makes me super happy.   everyone is so nice here and this store is so clean and the restrooms don't have those annoying keypad locks that the rest of the walgreens restrooms have.   ya, i could go on why this is the alpha location but i wont. i just love this place. esp the 'as seen on tv' aisle.  (btw- the smooth away does not get rid of any hair-fine, course, medium, nada- dont buy one)

I really wish the sugar bowl would re-vamp. I haven't been in a long time but the few times I have tried it I haven't been happy and have had no desire to go back. in fact when ppl suggest it i say "EW!".   The sundaes are overpriced and the servers take so long to bring them out that your ice cream is melted by the time you get it. so it just turns into a warm, melty mess. it's so expensive for an unappetizing sundae. i say stick to dairy queen over this place and if you're feelin like an upgrade just go to sweet republic.

The food is decent, nothing to really go crazy about and not really worth the price. but it's decent and close to work so that makes it easy.  the biggest issue i have is with the service. after multiple visits i have come to the conclusion that the servers and employees are friendly but it takes 1.5 hrs to have lunch. and that wouldn't be a problem if i thought the food was spectacular enough to wait that long. and our drinks are almost always empty and the servers are hard to find.   i'll most likely continue eating here every now and then bc it's convenient and it's easy to please everyone... but i wouldn't really go out of my way to go here.

If I could only shop at Nordstrom I would. Nordstrom should teach other places how customers should be treated.  favorite random surprisingly unknown fact about Nordys: they price match. shop dillard's macy's even ROSS, if Nordstrom has the exact same item but it has not yet been reduced, they will give it to you at that price no questions asked. so you can get the nordstrom service with the prices of Ross and without having to deal with Dillard's crap return almost non-existent return policy and customer service.   also, i recommend continuously shopping with the same associate, loyalty pays off- promise! :)  and don't even try to buy a bra anywhere other than nordstrom, waste of your time and money! have a girl measure you, sit down and play tetris on your phone like I do and she will bring you the best bras that you swear were designed for you.

Tiffany @ the chanel counter.  Tana in the lingerie department.   these are my go-to girls for everything. i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else. except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room.   but everything else: make up, accessories, clothes....all to one of these girls. i recommend you only work with them as well :)

bee tee dubs, did you know that mr. harkins goes here? we once shared a waiting room and he promised me free movie tickets. pay up movie man.   i have had my blood taken a few times in my life- and sonora quest always finds my veins. i love them for that.   there is one guy who is the vein genius. ask for the giant black man. im not even kidding, i don't know how he does it, but you don't feel a THING. he is the best.  i also love that the male nurses flirt with me right before they prick me. it distracts me.   and none of the nurses have bad breath- which is important when you're that close to someone.   always request to use sonora quest when and if you need to have your blood drawn- the competitors are vein murderers.

my review is based solely on sales girl, nikki. she is AWESOME! today a girl at work had the most fabulous necklace on and told me she got it at guess (marciano). I looked online and couldn't find it so I called to see if they could put one on hold for me in the store to pick up later.   well, nikki sold the last one yesterday. She checked online and was able to find it, she also found two stores that had it in stock and gave me their numbers. THEN she checked their warehouse and sure enough, they had it. She ordered it for me and did not charge S&H for 2-day delivery. so my beloved necklace will be here on Friday. saaa-weeeet! i already know what i'm going to wear it with :)  Nikki is a freakin rock star! I am going to call the store and let them know how awesome she is, too. How often can you find someone willing to go through all of that just to get you a silly necklace?   Next time you're at Guess ask for Nikki, she will do more than you could even think to ask for.

we sat at the chefs table and i love the eye contact Razz makes. some people never look you in the eye and thats a huge pet peeve of mine. but razz locks eyes and i love it. i guess you could call me an eye-locking whore.  Be sure to only eat at the chefs table and just let Razz decide what you're going to eat and drink.    the first course was like a crab cake w a curry sauce and carmelized ginger. on top of bitter greens. i can't even explain it other than it was like little angels dancing in my mouth.   the 2nd course made me decide that if Razz cooks me seafood I will LOVE it. it was like red snapper with a sauce that i'm just going to call butter bc it was so good and light. and then the snapper was on top of a bed of beans that were to die for. i'm sure there was a great explanation but i couldn't hear Razz over my thoughts. the "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMs" and the "OHHHHHHHHs" going on in my head were very loud. I'm sure my eyes looked like they were going to pop out of my head.  this is where things start to get blurry but i'm pretty sure our 3rd course was lobster, crab and some other shell fish in filo dough on top of a tomato, basil and garlic puree. it was soooo super tasty.  next was my 2nd favorite course- it was oxtail on top of a queso crisp with an avocado relish. YUM! YUMMY YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!!   5th course- my least favorite- i learned that Razz can make me like seafood but he can't make me like duck. I was super adventurous and figured i'd probably like it but oh my gosh, sooooo not for me.   6th course- delicious rice mixed in with oysters...or was it clams? or muscles? you get the idea, right? whatever it was, i did not find a pearl in the middle.  it had a spanish flare. it was very good. i was pretty overwhlemed and stuffed beyond measure by this point so i can't remember. and i had a glass of wine and i'm a weak drinker so for me that means borderline drunk.   last was dessert- it came with a slice of passionfruit cake (not my thing), a slice of a coconut type cake (super good) and a wedge of this very intense piece of chocolate (that was totally my thing). we were so super full we had to box it but it was tasty.  I could be mixing everything up and saying it wrong but the important thing to know is that "anything made in this building is the best and everyone will like"- Razz  on that note, i can't wait to go back!!!!! he was sooo fun to sit and eat with, definitely be sure to eat the chefs table. BTW- restaurants.com has a $100 gift card when you spend $200- which is SOOOO doable. we had 6 courses, plus dessert and 3 glasses of wine and our bill came out to $196.  196 -100  coupon ____ 96   / 2 diners= about $50 per person plus tip.

When I got in my accident I was referred here.  I needed a new grill and front bumper. (didn't that totally just sound like one of those Hasting's and Hasting's commercials? lol! Now picture me without a few teeth) They somehow lost the emblem so my emblems were all mismatched. I guess the one I had was discontinued, too. They called a trillion different places to find one without any luck and eventually the manager just paid to have one custom made for me.

This is very delicious, but the blue nile up the street is my favorite ethiopian.  I recommend everything but the lamb. I really like their doro wat, too. the shuro wat and collard greens. its very good.

we started with the cucumber, tomato, onion and parsley salad which was amazing. it was super fresh and so tasty. our waitress told us they don't chop the veggies until someone orders it.   i had a chicken kabob (some of the best chicken i've had in...maybe ever) and an onion kabob. freaking so good. the onion was nice and charred and it was so much food.  my sister had the chicken kabob with the basmati rice that had the berries on top. she said it was ridiculously good.  by far some of the freshest food and most flavorful food i've had in awhile!

i recommend making the people you go with order several things so you can have a bite of everything.  everything is good. so good.   i think the gyro meat was my favorite, their pitas are so fluffy and soft... like little cushions from heaven sent to earth with the sole purpose of harnessing that delicious meat.   i can't even remember everything we had but i know i liked every bite and you will too. we had like 3 days of left overs as well, but we went a little over board in our ordering.

go back to the days of standing in the 3rd grade lunch line. you are served up a weird textured burger on plain bun and it is so nasty you eat just enough to make it until you get to go home and not too much in order to prevent death by cafeteria food. this was very similar. even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent. want to relive the elementary lunch room? take a visit here.   i really hate to give 1 star but the entire hamburger and fries had to be trashed. so nasty.  If someone suggests going to Rallys for a burger you better scream no!!!!!!!   I was hopeful, I had been a few times, never impressed but never disgusted, but i also wasn't paying attention bc i try to only eat at places like this if i'm in a hurry.  today, i was disgusted. I don't know if my senses were on height or something but this food was stinky. i have a thing about microwaves and these burgers tasted and smelled microwaved. I'm not sure if they were but i don't care, that's even worse if they werent. the meat was kinda grey and the tomatoes were colorless.   I always upgrade my drink to a large and they asked if i would like to rally my fries. i stupidly made the assumption that this meant large fries and usually places charge you less if you upgrade both, so i said yes. let me tell you what it REALLY means. it means they are going to put every nasty condiment on your fries and serve them to you with a spork.   after throwin my burger out i figured i could at least eat the fries(this was before i knew that they had been 'rally'ed up)   i KNEW i could smell mayonnaise somewhere. i HATE mayonnaise. these fries were soaking in mayonnaise, and a bunch of other slop. I didnt take a very long look at all of the nasty things on top bc i had to trash it before i threw up.   my goodness it was so gross. i can't even handle how gross it was.

i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza. i hate the sweet sauce, i hate that the ingredients are under the cheese so they don't get crunchy and crispy, the pepperoni is floppy. just not for me. the crust was kinda gooey like.   my delivery was 30 minutes late but its ok bc i wasn't in a hurry. they were really nice i just can't stand this kind of pizza.    if you like the sweet sauce and toppings under the cheese then go for it bc you'll probably love it!

Prob one of the worst manicures I've had. My tech was super sweet and did a great job with the start of the manicure. She did a great job filing my nails and cleaning up my cuticles....   Where it went down hill was when she polished my nails. Bubbles galore which is a peeve of mine. and it's been 40 minutes and my nails are still wet?? Thats after we kept them under the fan forever bc they wouldnt dry. Wtf?? They have finger prints and indents now. It's like I have goop on my nails. I think it's time for new polishes and top coats, guys.  Oh, and Whitney Cummings came in while I was here. I got about 15 pictures of the back of her head.

this is one of my favorites in tempe.   I recommend the fruit and cheese platter the chipotle chicken pasta the roast beef sandwich- this one tops Houston's in my opinion!  and even though the pomegranite glazed chicken sounds appetizing it's a little tart and you eventually can't taste anything but the pomegranite glaze...it's a flavor stealer.   the host man needs an attitude check big time. don't be afraid to ask this little brat for the seat you want. you came here for the view and the food so get what you want. don't let the obnoxious host give you hell about it.

Tracy is the MAN. you should go see him if anything ever happens to your car.   He might possibly be the nicest, most professional, honest man.   I can't tell you how many times i have done something stupid to my car. And about 90% of the time I end up at Tracy's.   I am a bargain shopper and Tracy always gives me the best quotes. My car looks PERFECT when I get it back.   The last time I used Scottsdale Paint and Auto Body because Lexus told me it was important to go there but I think they might have some deal going with them or something. Take your car to Tracy instead. You won't regret it.

I only go here for lunch bc it is reasonably priced.  I think their sandwiches are great! and I love the artisan bread w olive oil.   I have never had bad service, it can be a bit slow but never bad.   this is just a delicious, not ordinary bread and cold cuts sandwich, for around $9. not bad!

my pasta bolognese was super tasty. my friends steak was phenom. we had a table with a view and the staff was really friendly.   it honestly wasn't anything AMAZING or over the top but it was tasty and we had a good time and really no complaints!

I really like this little joint, it's definitely a place you go to with the mindset that you are going to enjoy the long wait and make it an experience. Why do you want to rush through something so tasty and charming anyway? the little bar that you wait in next door is so precious and lit up with candles, take a breather from our fast pace lifestyle and just enjoy your company, wine and appetizer. Then, when it's time for pizza enjoy that too! definitely don't come here if you are on a time watch or you're sure to be annoyed. the pizza is worth waiting for.   not good for a first date bc if it doesn't go well then you're stuck with them for a LONNNNNGGGGGG time.  And only 4 stars because you have to be in a mindset to eat here in order to enjoy the experience

i LOVED my stay at the bellagio. I loved it even more that my company paid for it.   My flight landed at like 8am something and check in wasn't until like way later in the afternoon.... but i arrived and asked the girl working at the front desk if there was anything she could do.  i lucked out! she said i was the first person all morning to be nice to her and she gave me a BEAUTIFUL room. one of my co-workers was also staying at the bellagio and her room was no where near as nice as mine...like totally outdated and not as spacious. she was in the spa towers.  and yes, i definitely rubbed it in her face that my room was 40x better.   My amazing room had a view of the pool, was super super clean, had all the amenities i could ever ask for, free and FAST wifi, was decorated super cute... it even had my favorite option: curtains controlled by a bedside button. don't you just love that!?! i totally need that in my house.   i also had some business cards sent to the bellagio business center bc they weren't going to arrive to my office back home in time and they made that go very smoothly for me.   they had the best pillows too. i called the morning of check out and was like 'do you sell your pillows and if not how much would you bill me if i stole one?' thankfully, they sell them and they are $30 for the king size. concierge will pick one up for you, too.  i was actually kinda sad to leave. i loved getting ready there in the mornings bc the bathroom counters were super spacious so i could lay out all my stuff and the shower had almost instant hot water...i never got a chance to use the tub but one day i will. one day...

i just like this place. i like the feeling i have when i'm there. it's so happy and calming and sunshiney.   i like the guy with the darth vader voice, i think he's the owner. but i like him. he adds a certain charm, you know? "would you like a diet coke" suddenly seems new and fresh when he asks you.   i love our servers everytime we go in. i love their patio. i like whatever marinade they use on their chicken.   i like it all. i like the prices, too.   and deep fried avocado? genius. purely genius.

First off- let me say I am a HUGE fan of our waitress. I think her name was Sheryl? She was so awesome. She told me I would like the Feztini and she was right.   I finally got to go to Fez the other night! It was tasty. I had the grilled chicken sandwhich and that was so good. I got it with the spicy fries. I tasted the tangier(?) burger and it was so-so.  Next time I plan on trying the flatbeads. those sounded tasty.  I was a little bummed about their tap water. I know az has gross tap water but usually you can drown it with lemons, this tap water had an after taste that refused to leave. yuck.   all in all, I was a fan of our waitress, a fan of my sandwich, and a huge fan of my feztini.

tasty pasty!    my favorite part of my experience was the butter and the jam. DEEELISSHHHH.   i could hardly make a dent in my pancakes but I couldn't just let that butter go to waste, so i put the rest of the butter on a piece of pancake and ate that. it would have been weird if i just ate the butter, but i would have. I got the rest to go and asked for extra butter to come along with it. I think the pancakes were amazing, but it could have just been that butter.   I must have thought I hadn't eaten in years bc I also ordered the bacon which is the best bacon i've ever had. let's add that to my list of best part. bacon, strawberry jam, and butter. healthy eating at it's finest.   I also had the homefries but they needed salt and didn't go well w the ketchup they are served with.   I would go back and order strawberry jam toast,  mountain of butter, and 12 slices of bacon.

very cute place.   we wanted some dim sum but ended up ordering meals. we should have stayed with the dim sum idea bc that was the best part.    everything was insanely fresh and clean. the soup, the spring rolls, the dumplings...yum. the actual meal (general tso) wasn't that good, i gave it away. but everything else was tasty and the service was really sweet.

i like the ooey gooey cupcake! the chocolate cake is soooo moist and cooked evenly in perfection. only it's served chilled? it's weird.   their cookies are good, too. I bought a tub of their easter sugar cookies and they are so stinking cute! they're very sweet though so it's impossible to eat more than 2 per day but soo good. anymore than that you'd need insulin. :)

Let's get the boring bad  stuff out of the way so I can talk about the fun part.  over-priced not delicious you have two people waiting on you, but it's always slow bad water- seriously, not even a lemon can mask the disgusting flavor of their water it's always cold  honestly, if this restaurant wasn't high up and spinning, i would never go here.  i took my nieces ice skating at city scape so i figured this would be a fun place to have an over priced dinner since we were right up the street. When in Rome....or something.  I ordered some curry chicken thing and my nieces had grilled cheese off the kids menu.  we also ordered a molten cake for dessert but there was no molten? whatever, no need to to hash it because i knew going in the food sorta sucks.   Our bill was $70 but we seriously had a blast. The whole dinner was filled with gasps and excitement and sheer thrill about how fun this restaurant was.

DANG IT! my cubano was so good!!   it was recommded to me by the carhop. i wanted something on the sweeter side that was also strong. this came with 2 shots of espresso, cinnamon and milk. it was perf.  i also liked the car hop. he was so cool. i told him it was my first time so he did jazz hands as a welcome.   i also picked up a chai latte for my friend and she said it was amazeballs.

I like to describe this place as the italian version of Pei Wei, only not as tasty.   I have been 3 times now and never have I been like "I'm glad I ate that".   I heard from a ton of ppl that their mac and cheese was so good, well despite that it was cold and the noodles were undercooked, slightly crunchy, when I got it, it might have been decent bc the cheese sauce was flavorful.   I first went here with my old roommate when we had an intense craving for spaghetti with meatballs. you would think a place called Sauce would serve that, but nope.   The pizza was so-so but not worth the price. and forget about that lame little roll they give you.   Ya, I'd rather not. Hop over to olive and ivy next door and spend a few extra bucks on their pizza which is by far better.

What is bingsoo? well, here's how it went down  you select 3 fresh fruits 1 fruit puree yogurt or icecream (the yogurt isn't tart and what they recommend, it's sweet and delicious)   then they take a bowl, put in shaved ice, the yogurt/ice cream, the fruits, and puree. you mix it all together and enjoy.  my recommendation is to ask for light to medium ice shavings, mine got a bit too cold and it started to numb all of the flavors. but i enjoy the texture from the ice so it's definitely a must.   allll of this for less than $5!!! any other yogurt place would cost you much more for all of these fresh ingredients, even extra toppings are only $.25  the guy who was working was very sweet, great place. i cant wait to go back

This is the best dog park in the valley, or at least that I have been to. It's the only one where people actually pick up their dog's crap and unlike other parks, it looks like owner's have actually given their dog a bath in the last year. My girls love this park, too. It's separated by aggressive and passive dogs complete with doggy fountains and green grass. I only wish there were more trees and shade.

drunk at kona someone in our group shouts, "LET'S GO SING KARAOKE!!!!!!!!!"   it was the best idea of the night, obviously.   we called a bunch of karaoke bars and all had the lame response of only on sundays or thursdays.   don't they know wednesday nights are where it's at?!?!   we finally found this place. and they had karaoke. on wednesdays. they might have it every night. in fact, they should have it every night because that's the only reason to go to this bar.   it is really skanky but a freaking blast. the patrons are unattractive but fun to sing with. and that's all that matters when you're trying to rock out to dixie chicks. good times.  also, i don't think i'd ever eat here. i dont get the food vibe from this place. i've never had their food but just from hanging out in there i know i wouldn't touch their food. but that's just me i guess.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed the drive in yet! I take my nieces all the time! I used to go with my bf all the time. I LOVE the drive in.   my mom used to take me when i was kid. it was always a special occasion and i always fell asleep by the 2nd movie.   it is so cheap for everyone to go. but bring cash.   i don't know if this is allowed so hopefully i dont get punished BUT i always bring my dogs and we pick up dinner.   we have a drive in routine. we put on our softest pjs, put our hair in a pony tail, bring pillows, blankets and head over. so fun.

After a satisfying saturday breakfast at Matt's, we headed to the farmers market. People were still setting up shop as we walked through but I am glad I got to check out what was being offered.  I love that the whole thing is tented, it was nice out when we went but summer heat is just around the corner!   I have a thing about jam/jelly. it's actually my dream to make jam when i grow up using things i pick myself. one day, you'll see, one day...  anyway, that ended up being the only thing we bought. it was an awesome assortment of jalapeno jellys that were made the week before by the girl selling. WOW!  she also gave us some great recipes. very nice.   it went great with all of the margaritas we made when we got home. we poured it on top of cream cheese and snacked with chips. delicious.

this place always smells like geriatrics. the green wall paper doesn't help with that ambiance either. don't forget to note the brass light fixtures.  for some reason my family loves this place and i'm always forced to go for birthdays or whatever. I personally don't get it. The food is pretty nasty. Everything I have ever had here reminds me of the marie calendars frozen dinners...except that marie calendars frozen dinners taste better and are priced to match the quality of food.   The service is mediocre, I guess.   They have a salad bar which also has a few other options but all nasty, again. nothing grosses me out more than plastic bowls filled with cold and cheap ranch.   and not to be mean or anything but the people who dine here gross me out. There are certain ages of people who just gross me out when they eat: infant-3 yrs old and then it starts again somewhere around age 80-death. I love old people and babies, but I hate watching them eat or thinking about their hands being anywhere near food that I have to eat.    This place just isn't for me I guess. I will say that my step dad thinks the bread pudding is to die for- keep in mind he's in the same age range as most of the diners here so take from it what you will...

I have been going to Vinny and Angie for about 10 years! Before I would hop from salon to salon trying to find a stylist who actually listened to what I wanted.   When I met Vinny, it was love at first cut! Vinny and Angie left the salon I orginally met them at, got married and started their on salon, Salon Di Vita.   Now all of my friends go to Vinny and Angie. You are guaranteed an excellent hair cut and you will pee your pants while you're there because they are HILARIOUS!   Both of them are always taking classes from the best stylists so your cut will be up to date and flattering to your individual facial features and style. You will love them!   They can do classic cuts, they can do funky, make something up and they can execute it. They are master colorists as well.

i will GLADLY spend $20-something on one meal here. GLAD. LY.   This is what I ate:  Sirloin on the wood grill with green beans. and a side of raw horseradish.  i basically licked my plate. It was one of the best steaks i've had in a LONG time. there were no imperfections on my cut of meat, i was able to eat every single bite of that 12 ounce beautiful hunk of cow. I mean, i wasn't able to eat for the rest of the day but so worth it. I didn't have to trim off any questionable pieces, every bite was perfection.  the flavors of the wood grill are very strong and pure bliss. and the seasoning made me sing.   and the green beans were rock stars. although, i saw someone dipping the large steak fries in au jus and i got a little jealous that i didn't order fries but maybe next time.   and i mean, if you think about it, since this is all i ate that day it averaged out to like $10 per meal if i pretend to divide it out and that's a steal!

ha. they close at 9.  my sister and i had exactly 15 minutes to buy some hair dye so we rushed! we got there 12 minutes before closing. We got out of the car and, BAM! the girl turned off the lights!!   natalie and i checked our cell phone clocks. could the time be off? we have time to run in, right? both of our phones read the same time and we were safe. but, the girl wanted to close early i guess.  so we sadly got back in the car feeling totally crushed and saw the girl looking out the window all nervous like. I think she knows she would have gotten in trouble for closing the doors that early. you could tell she was regretting her decision as she paced back and forth and watched us.   as much as i wanted to tattle on her i didn't, so i'll just yelp on her. stay open til the close time lady!!!!

I switched to chase from BofA, I wasn't a customer for very long because they put a hold on all of my checks. I was younger just starting college and didn't make much money but still, they put holds on my checks. and back then my $200 checks meant life or death basically. It was soooooooooo frusturating so i closed my checking and savings account.   I currently have a chase credit card and everything has been fine, no problems. but nothing great either.  **update** chase increased my CC apr to an insanely high amount for no reason. i asked to have it lowered based on my good standing and what not. they declined so i opened a CC w wells fargo w a MUCH lower apr.

I had to end my long love affair with TMobile this week. We were together for 11 years. No fights, no lying, no cheating...just love. It was a perfect romance and definitely one of the saddest break ups. I will be back, someday.   My mom bought me an iPhone for Christmas with an upgrade she had on her account. My plan was to unlock it and use it with TMobile. That was until my mom called and told me I would be forced to use ATT because she was being charged for an extra plan. Cue the tears.  It felt like an arranged marriage. I didn't want to leave my Tmobile boyfriend that I loved. But I had to suck it up and marry ATT for the time being. I don't think it will be long, I figure once I blow through my moms roll over minutes in the next few months I will be able to unlock my iphone and switch back to Tmobile.  so far i've been with ATT for a few days and these are the major differences i've noticed and believe Tmobile is far better:  1. price- with tmobile I had unlimited data, minutes, and texts all for under $90/mo after taxes. to get the same plan at ATT i would have to pay about $30 more a month and then it's not even unlimited data. Thankfully I'm on my moms account and they have like 10k rollovers so I don't need an unlimited plan.  2. getting ahold of a person- 611 and option 0 and you would immediately be connected to a human. with ATT they make you do a bunch of crazy options and then they put you on hold. I sat on hold several times and then it would just hang up on me. when i finally got ahold of ATT people some of the offices were closed....which brings me to 3. does tmobile ever close? ok they do at like 1am and that's amazing! there are a couple hours in the wee night you have to do without. go to bed!  4. when you're on hold with tmobile they play soft music. ATT uses that time to try and sell you crap. it's the last thing i want to hear when i'm waiting on hold. it's like being held hostage because they know you have to listen. tacky, i say.  5. customer service- att customer service hasn't been bad, but tmobile has that little pep in the step.  6. i never lost service or dropped calls with tmobile. but i have a few times already with ATT :( 7. ATT messed up the porting of my old number so right now  i have some random temporary number until they can fix it.   i could keep going but i will it stop there. i love tmobile and i can't wait to be re-united.

beware of iced tea!!!!!!!  I was driving to my sisters to help her paint her new house. She had several other girlfriends there so i decided to stop and get us some tea. I got a gallon of their unsweetened tea.  When I got to my sisters, she went to open it but stopped bc of white-worm like floaties.  sure enough, there were mucusy- octopus shaped like floaties EVERYWHERE. it was FUNGUS!!!!!!   FUNGUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I watched the manager fill up my gallon of tea so I know he didn't alter it. that's what they were serving everyone.  oh. my. god. BARF!   That means they dont clean their tea tanks and they havent in sometime in order to get these few inch long fungus floaties.  I called the next day and the manager on duty really couldn't get me of f the phone fast enough and just wanted to shut me up. She was like "no, we do clean them. whats your address? I will send you a gift card." "uhhh, i don't want anything. I just want you to be aware of your nasty tea so no one gets sick." "ya, ya ill take care of it. whats your address."   so do i know if she heard i word i said? nope.  will i ever order tea again? nope.  will i ever be able to eat there without thinking about what other things haven't been cleaned and have octopus shaped fungus growing? nope.  i think i will avoid all chick fil a locations.  vom. vom. VOM!!!!!!  ps- i found a pic online of what it looked like, there were some smaller and bigger in there but thats the idea of what you should keep your eyes out for.

Sounds like since your Gold Star in June things have gone south....  just sayin..........  Even though you are proud of your Gold Star from a couple months ago, it does not eliminate the fact that I had several large fungus clumps in my tea shortly after this so-called inspection.

gross.   i had an appointment for a car detail and as i'm stepping out of the car, these auto glass people start talking to me about my windshield. at least let me get out of the car, sheesh.   they told me my windshield had little flecks and they could repair it right then. and like most people, i have 100% coverage, so sure fine take care of it.  as i'm paying for my car detail, they come up to me and ask when i would like to schedule them to come out.   i have to schedule? ohhhh hmmm, nevermind, i'll call another time when i have time to look at my schedule.  instead of politely understanding, the guy would not let it go.  'well, we can come to your work' 'really, that's ok. i'll call another time when i can look at my schedule' 'we can work around your schedule. what does it look like?'  at this point the inner me wanted to shout 'listen buddy, i have client appointments, i don't know what time, leave me ALONE.'  but i refrained. i politely said, 'i know you probably need me to schedule now because you probably have minimums to meet for your job, but i am not going to so please let it go'   (i'm not sure that it was all that much more polite now that i look back at it).   now he lets up and says 'ok, i just need you to sign this paperwork then'   'pardon me, you need me to sign? what for?'  'so we can bill your insurance'  'um you don't need to bill my insurance until I have my windshield repaired'   'actually, we're a preferred company for Allstate, it's just so when you do schedule everything will already be handled'  'NO!!!!!!!!!!! I am not signing anything!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE STOP'   so, i lost it. whatever, he was annoying, it was hot outside and i was grumpy. then i called Allstate and told them how annoying this place was and they should definitely consider removing them as a preferred shop.... and to tattle that they wanted to bill them even though they hadn't provided a service.  my nieces were with me and watching my car go through the wash while this guy was talking to me. apparently i really did flip out because my sister called me and told me the girls were re-enacting my 'mean face'. bahahahaha.

i really like the roof. like, a lot. i thought this place was really cool. we got fast service at the bar and the music definitely lead me to showing off my sweet dance moves. the crowd here was really cool and a big mix of really nice people. i love when you find people like that!   the only thing i didnt like was the smell of barf on the roof. it really grossed me out.

why is this place so far away??  we ordered a burger, the grilled chicken sandwich, fries and onion rings. we topped it off w a fresh strawberry shake since it was the special for the day.   we split everything and boy oh boy was it great! I have also heard that their pizza is awesome and their breakfast. I need to go back and get both.  also, don't forget to check out the bathroom. i think i spent like 15 minutes in there. lol jk. it is pretty entertaining though.

so there's this guy who is hanging out at the store when i walk in. he didn't have any gelato and i figured he was the employees boyfriend or something.  anyway, every sample i tried...this guy would chime in. :)  "good choice, Walter really hates making the peanut butter one. he just doesn't think it's that great. i told him it's an american thing."  "oh ya, that one is a favorite. You know...Walter imports everything and he is actually one of the only people in america to have this certification to have certain things shipped"  quite the knowledgeable character!   i purchased the yelp deal so i bought the small to-go container. i got half peanut de sil and half african dark chocolate. both were good, i can't pick a favorite. the chocolate is some of the best chocolate i've had. and the peanut de sil had little chunks of peanut in it.    scrumptious and entertaining visit!

I like their red velvet cake.  the best way to enjoy sprinkles cupcakes is to buy their mix, follow the directions EXACTLY for the cupcakes and the frosting and enjoy.   it is 238475230984572098347520983475290837452908374598273458723457 times better. the ones in the store do not even compare to the ones you make with their mix.

I really like Cupcake's cupcakes! really moist and they give you lots of frosting so you can decide how much to use. i don't like their vanilla flavored cupcakes at all so stick with the chocolate, red velvet, cosmopolitan or my fav the peanut butter filled chocolate. stay away from the cookies and cream too. not a fan. i also wish they sold them in sets of  4 like sprinkles. sometimes 2 is too few and 6 is too many... but overall, i really enjoy their cupcakes

updating my review because i'm totally pissed off! your hamburgers aren't good enough for me to constantly be super pissed off with you guys.  i have come in several times with large parties, small parties, referred people here and i take it all back.   i came in with a friend and we weren't given the table because they were holding it 'just in case' a larger party came in. what? we're your customers and guess what. we are here. now.   are you SURE a larger party will come in?  no. are we not worthy of a seat because there aren't 5 us? well, according to stax that's the case.   well F that.   I will gladly go somewhere else and be sure to tell everyone how awful you are. besides, your 'just in case' guests are far more important than the ones currently there ready to pay.   so long stax

my boss asked me where we should go for lunch today and i was already a nervous wreck thinking he was going to fire me or something. why did he want to go to lunch??! i've been here 4 years and we have never had lunch. i think i got an ulcer worrying about it yesterday.   anyway, i panicked and just started listing things that I knew would be close to work and some how stax popped out of my mouth. instantly i started thinking to myself  'oh, crap, why did you just say that? i hope he doesn't say he wants to go to stax'   and then he was like 'hmm, stax sounds good'   CRAP!   so whatever, i'm an agreeable girl. and i did, afterall, suggest it... kinda.    we got a table and i ordered water w. lemon and he had a diet coke. when his DC came, i remembered another reason for hating this place. the DC came in a stupid bottle. i hate that they do that. its like they just want to find any reason to charge you for something stupid. i bet they wanted to charge me for my lemon slice, too. which, by the way, is the dumbest, lamest lemon wedge. you can't even squeeze it. totally pointless slice of lemon.   i wasn't hungry so i just ordered a little burger and it looks so sad and wimpy on the plate. he took a bite of his chicken and put it down and it totally looked raw. so i look at my boss and he has this look of disgust on his face. sure enough, it wasn't cooked. he lost his appetite.  they comped our meal but now he won't ever go back either. that makes another person i know of who will never eat there again.   we left and the waitress came running out to ask if we wanted the receipt?? that's funny.   so you didnt notice us the entire time to notice that my water was empty or his DC was gone? you didnt notice us when my boss tried to track you down to tell you his food was raw so he had to bring it to you?    but you notice us the second we leave so you can chase us down the street to give us a receipt?? ummmmmmmm.   ya, i hate this place.

they owe me a branded, stemless wine glass. it comes with the taste menu. and they were out.   i went with a few girlfriends and we had SO much fun. we were the only ones there and we ordered a tasty cheese plate and a bunch of wine tasters.  my favorites were the apple wine and the port. so good! i can't wait to buy a few bottles.   the price was extremely reasonable as well. the service was awesome and our waiter/owner was hilarious. one of my friends was shamelessly hitting on him, his wife eventually took over. ha!   but they were amazing. the experience was so fun and the space is open and airy and bright. i loved it. i will definitely be back to do the tasters again or to buy the bottles.   i think they mentioned being able to do personal labels as well which could be fun!

if this review was based solely on those little brownies they sell, it would be 5 stars. I'm only reviewing this place bc of those pre-packaged brownies. do yourself a favor and order 27 of them, they are so tasty. if you HAVE to eat here(drunk, late night), get the sandwich that has the salami, I forget the name, and add banana peppers. but don't forget your 27 brownies, there's no point in really eating here without the brownie.

Ewwwww   Are people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood??   Bc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.  Our food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs.   My friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty.   We'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs.   Seriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty.

The first time I decided to try this place I drove out there only to realize it closes early. but I finally made it back out and i am glad i did! I had the original ranch burger, so good. the only down side was the tomatos didn't look fresh. I just took them off my burger but other than that it was soooo tasty! I love their fries, too. next time I am in the area and craving a good drive-thru burger i will stop here most definitely

I spent $30 per dog tag on two tags that were guaranteed to last. Well only one of them made it, the other one fell apart. I called to see if they could just remake the one that broke since they told me it would last. The other one I bought for my other dog is still in perfect condition.     I don't live super close to this location anymore and the petsmart by me doesn't have this new machine to make them. The manager wants me to come in and show it to him so that he can tell me if it's worthy of a replacement or not because people lie to him and he can't take it back if it was abused.   ok, first of all. my dog weighs 4 pounds, how in the world could she abuse a dog tag?   second of all, just because some customers have lied to you in the past doesn't mean that I should be punished and be treated like a liar as well.  I spend lots of money at petsmart every year.   I don't think it's appropriate to make me drive all the way to your store so that you can figure out that I am not a liar. In this case, the manager has all the freedom to decide what he wants regardless of the truth. I would be out gas and time if he chooses to say I abused a dog tag or for whatever reason he wants to make up so that he doesn't have to replace $30.   I will go in for the last time to fight for my replacement and that will be the last time i step into a petsmart. I will find a new store to be loyal to and spend my money where it is appreciated and they don't assume i am a criminal.   It would be much wiser to replace a dog tag and earn my respect and loyalty than to lose me as a customer. but maybe they are just doing so fabulous in this economy and don't need my money. i doubt it.   so if you see someone raising hell over a stupid dog tag- its probably me. i will never go down without a fight, LOL!   get over yourself, petsmart.

PSH!!!! YC has nothing on Genghi! here are my reasons why:  -fresh, not frozen protein -way better veggie options -seasonings- PURELY genius! i LOVE the option of seasonings, sauces or a mixture of both. genghi's makes all of these options available with my fav section of seasonings -eggs- genius!   and i'm sure this isn't just Genghi's but i love that they'll cook your food in water instead of oil.   $10 for two meals worth of food. i lurve it!

i have a SUPER hard time giving this place less than 3 stars. I am convinced it was an off day. I went a few weeks back and went back and forth on whether or not i should write a review.    I normally wouldn't review it until after i gave it a second chance but i honestly don't see myself ever giving it a second chance. so because of that i will rate based on my belief that this place actually is better than my experience.  i want to start with the positive. i like the casual space and i love the chef standing by the oven. he is so cute. looks like he's straight off of a nintendo game. mario-esque. he looks like he's totally just jolly and humming while he works. i love him. i also like the prices.  now to the nitty gritty.  we were in a rush and i had heard they do pizza by the slice. sounds fast to me.  well, it wasn't.  we take a seat at the bar and the bartender is basically on the other side shouting at us? i wasn't even sure he was talking to us. did he want us to shout across and over all of the other people at the bar? this wasn't a loud place, it was actually super quiet in there so the shouting was very awkward and obnoxious. i like to be greeted somewhat close to my face, not shouted at. made me really uncomfortable.   then he was chit chatting on his phone, it was obviously a personal call. we just sat waiting and waiting to order our slices. finally he makes it close to us to take our order and the jolly pizza oven man gets to work :) I'm not sure what took so long after that but it took forever to get our slices. we were there for 30 minutes when i had expected it to take about 5-10.   my friend got the plain cheese slice and i got the prosciutto arugala slice. both were pretty nasty. mine smelled like feet and fish. that went in the trash. we split her cheese slice to hold us over until we had time to pick up something else.

I had a very yummy lunch yesterday. I opted for the pork adovada? I think that's what it was called. very tasty. my friend ordered their spinach salad w strawberries and pine nuts and that looked super tasty.   I have two complaints: the ceiling and the seating arrangements.   The ceiling is really yucky and the air vents are surrounded by black stain. it makes you wonder when the last time they cleaned the filters to make the air stain the ceiling like that. and all of the crusty yellow spots crumbling away? ew.   The seats, way uncomfortable!!! really old chairs w no tush cushion and no booths. I think it's time for an upgrade!  and lastly, it would be nice to see some more friendly lunch prices- we split the bill down the middle and it came out to $16 each, that's a bit high. I won't be returning for lunch but I would go again for dinner...maybe. when I think about sitting in those awful chairs i give it a second thought.

I am a total fan! I came in 10 minutes before close (sorry employees!) and they were still super nice to me. I love their selection and I cant wait to go back and buy wine.   This trip I was picking up torani syrups because i'm on an italian soda kick. They had so many great flavors! my current fav is peach :)   I totally need to take advantange of their .05c wine sale one of these days...   Getcho booty patooty over there.

charlestons is one of the few chains i actually enjoy. I love their croissants and their staff is always awesome. their chicken strips are awesome. i love their grilled chicken and veggies, too.   They have an awesome blackened grilled chicken, they don't use oil to cook either which is a plus! they no longer have it on the menu but have never given me a problem ordering it!  yay for charlestons!

i originally went here bc i was in the mood for kabobs.  but the gentleman working seemed to have no clue what i was talking about. i always thought greek places served awesome kabobs! WHAATT  anyway, i decided to go for the greek salad instead and oh my golly.....so dang good.  they really load you up with all the wonderful ingredients that make a greek salad amazing. the chicken was quite tasty as well! another great lunch spot near work.

you know what set me off today? everytime i took a sip of my disgusting tap water it reminded me that i was charged $1.19 for disgusting tap water and i didn't realize until it was too late. i had already sat down with my $8 sandwich...which i paid close to $10 for because they charge for TAP WATER!!!! i can't believe it. well, what really set me off was the slow rude service...the tap water charge was just what made me so mad i decided i was going to yelp about how mad this store makes me! and, i must note, this wasn't an 'oops' bc my co-worker was also charged for tap water.   unfortunately, my work just moved offices from old town to NorDale so we no longer have an amazing surplus of lunch options. AJs happens to be one of the best options nearby to our new location. This review is for their service and one additional star bc the food is actually good.   I just can't stand the service we get at this place. We come a few times a week and it always takes them forever to make a sandwich...well, it takes forever for them to even notice that people need help bc they're too busy frolicking around with their co workers to pay attention that there's now a line at the sandwich area.   what kind of cheese do you have available for the sandwiches? (the selection is limited and not listed on the menu) *eye roll* well...what do you want? well...what i wanted was to hear my options but since you won't answer the question i guess i'll have havarti.   let's talk about their cashiers up at the front of the store. seriously, so rude everytime. they make sure i know how unhappy they are to be there. in the cashiers defense, i would be upset if i was a cashier too but i wouldn't be a jerk to people bc of it! you know what i say to that? have an attitude of gratitude! be thankful for what you do have and don't focus on what a miserable day youre having. no need to bring others down too!   a few more of my peeves: the orzo salad- sometimes it's 7.99/lb and sometimes it's 9.99/lb.  they charge $.75 for drink refills and $1.19 for a cup of water.  i'm going to mention their butt head employees one more time. if it was just a one time experience i wouldn't complain...but we've gone 10+ times in the past 2 months and the people are always rude in every department i've been in so far and slower than molasses. except for a few employees who are actually sweet, but they're the exception and not the rule unfortunately.

I am gonna have to say this one is the best. I have had Sprinkles, CupCakes, LuLu's,  Tammie Co, and this one is the best! Today(monday) they had a $1 cupcake sale...cant beat it! their cakes were soooo much moister than the competition and just fluffy goodness. I am going to have to make this my cupcake stop...and find out which days they have the sale goin on. We got 5 cupcakes for 5.60! You can't beat that!!  HOWEVER, I will say...the red velvet does not compete, pass on it. I recommend the chocolate with vanilla  and sprinkles and chocolate coconut.

Two facts: Culvers trumps In N Out. Whoever compared Culvers to Dairy Queen is bonkers. they don't even compare  I have been hearing this dumb commercial about 'being culverized' on KTAR and all I could think was how dumb it was that we were getting commercials for places we don't even have.  ha, i was dumb. we do have a culvers!!! and i am now in love.  reasons why it's better than In N Out: -while I love In N Outs meat patties, their cheese selection sucks. at culvers you pick your cheese- american, cheddar or swiss (i hate american cheese which is the only cheese offered at In N Out) - They have red onion, i love both onions but red is way better -I like their hamburger patties just a bit more than In N Outs(both are good) - Culvers shakes and custard are totallllllyyyyyy better than any milkshake In N Out could ever make. - I love all the options of burgers you can get at culvers! including bacon and if you dont want a burger their chicken strips look pretty awesome    i am so excited i heard those dumb commercials and looked them up!!!!!!  i will say that In N Outs fries are way better than culvers.  but that's it.

I hope the people who wrote reviews before me are just kidding.   This cafe is awful and overpriced. maybe we're not talking about the same place?  i once got 2 slices of wheat toast and a large diet coke. how much did it cost? $7.50!   this place has nasty microwaved food for way more than any of it is worth.   they go to costco and buy things, then wrap them up and sell them for $2-4 a piece.  I once brought my dinner to class but needed a fork. they wanted to charge me for a fork.   this place makes me angry, all the people who work there are slow and dumb.    there's a jack in the box up the street and when we have time to leave we go there and are much happier and don't spend $7 on something like a microwaved soft pretzel.

oh. my. word.  this place rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  my sister and i went today and were there for about 3 hours. we did not stop saying "LOOK AT THIS!!!!!!" "OMG IT'S SO CHEAP!"   literally. so cheap.  they had brand new stainless steel appliances, chandeliers, supplies, cabinets, flooring, ceiling fans, paint, furniture, DOORS, WINDOWS, i could go on! and its not gross stuff like you sometimes find at good will. it's AMAZING stuff. and the place is HUGE   they were having a light fixture sale(70% off) so my sister was able to get two amazing chandeliers (originally both together would have been close to $400) for a smokin hot $139!!!!!!!!!    can you even handle that? I cant. this is the place to go.  we also hit up the location in mesa- they have more bathtubs, sinks, electronics, toilets, etc.   we felt the location down town was a bit better than the one in Mesa but it all depends on what you're looking for.   i can't get over the prices.  1 thing- prepare yourself- it gets sticky. they don't have an AC- only a swamp cooler thingy. but you forget about how uncomfortable it is once you start flipping out about all of the amazing things you find.   i don't know why I haven't heard of this place sooner! thanks for sending it Jessica!!!!!

i am a major, major fan.   i had the chicken jungle curry. it wasn't spicy enough for me but it was very tasty. they are very accomodating with their menu and everything is super fresh. i hate going places when they tell me everything is already pre-made. this place is FRESH.   my chicken came with the most delicious eggplant, like so delicious i will order just eggplant and chicken next time i go. insane. it was like a little crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. lurve it.   the view was kinda cute and the place was small and trendy but still soft in a way. they did a good job.   the owner was awesome and spent quite a bit of time having conversations with people dining. i love when that happens :)   we will definitely be back. i didn't think it was expensive at all- each of our meals were right around $12. I would say for the quality that is a reasonable price for sure.

I wanted to update my review on their pint ice cream. since it's not like the Rep is super close to me I now have to get pints, ok i dont HAVE to but, ya I kinda do.  so, usually after you freeze ice cream for awhile or its been in the freezer a long time it gets pretty gross. ice crystally and maybe a little ooey sticky around the edges. ya know what im talkin about?   the Reps ice cream stays amazing. im not lying. it stays amazing. buy pints. they will sell ya a pint of whatever you want if they have it so fill up!! i spent $30 (i know yikes!) on pints not too long ago but I haven't had to go back  in a long time bc their pints don't go bad like grocery ice cream. so i get to enjoy the Rep at home!

I really don't think anything gets better than Nordstrom and I think it has to do with the way they make you feel like a princess.  I love their massages, pedicures, facials, products, but the best thing ever is the high pressure shower...let me just tell you!  they rub you down with an apricot scrub while you lay on this bed type thing. then this magical shower head uses water to massage you and clean off all of your scrub taking away any dead skin you might have had. my only complaint is it isn't long enough and you're left wanting more. I have never felt so great.   if i could give up bathing and just do this everday, i would be in heaven.   and the people are just so nice! I love the weird looking guy who works the desk, he has a charm about him.

i have super dry skin and spa nordstrom seems to be the only place i can find this product called cheeky baby butter. it's 99% organic and 100% natural.   i use it on my face instead of a night cream. my skin feels soooo much better and looks amazing the next day.   so if you have super dry skin like me, this will save you.  http://babybearshop.com/home.htm this website has more info about their products.  ps. we replaced lotion with this bc i don't care what any product says about no 'residue' after there's always one. but this stuff just leaves your hands soft and delicious

this place is so packed at lunch time and that's because it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!   i can never seem to order anything other than the yellow curry. i get a level 3 heat. i often get it to go and take it back to work.  i have dined in a time or two for their lunch special which is dirt cheap and enough food for left overs. it comes with your selection of main entree, soup or salad, and choice of rice.   it's seriously so good.   if you're on a lunch break you can easily enjoy a quick sit down meal here.

pretty scrumptious.  we had so much food it was nuts. my friend had a restaurants.com coupon so we went to town.   we ordered the takki nakki (jk i dont remember the name) it was potato pancake with onions and other amazing things. it was so insanely good...you must get it. it's one of the most recommended things in the yelp reviews and it's a starter so look for it.   then we ordered the chicken fritters. they were basically like indian style chicken nuggets. curry and mango served with a garbanzo bean dipping sauce. pretty good.  then we ordered the full experience meal. it came with chicken tandoori, indian style fried rice (amazing), chicken or lamb curry, a salad, a dessert (we got one of both and the rice pudding was the way to go) and chai tea.  i loved the little crispy thing they served before our meals with sauces. so amazing.   we also ordered garlic naan which was amazing.   the service was weird. there's a girl who fills up your water but she doesn't answer any questions. you have to wait for the hostess/waitress. she was super sweet but it was slow.   once you order, the food comes quickly and there is just so much food. if you like bland food, don't come here you boring white person! jk. kinda. be advernturous

3 girls on a thursday night decided steak sounded necessary.  as two of us waited for the 3rd girl to arrive our waiter stops by and says 'when is your friend getting here? i don't want to explain the menu a bunch of times.'  uh ok.  we ordered the bacon wrapped scallops to start. believe it or not it was my FIRST TIME having scallops! I am not a big seafood eater but I would eat these again. tasty.   while we browsed the menu trying to make a selection the waiter came by and was like 'will you close your menu when you're ready so that i don't have to keep coming by your table?'   blank stares from us.   seriously? wtf?   we're chatty girls wanting to enjoy a nice, not rushed dinner.   he pops by again and asks if we're ready. thankfully one of my friends has more balls than me and says 'my menu is still open and i'm following your rules so...'   and he walked away.  we closed our menus to signal our waiter and we ordered escargot, prime rib, salads, soup etc.  the escargot was another first for me! it was tasty but i wouldn't order it again. glad i tried it though!   my prime rib was ok, definitely not the best i've ever had. we also ordered the creme brulee and it was good...nothing amazing.   while this was a place of many first for me, it will be my first and last time visiting bc of the rude waiter.  the prices aren't worth the food and service.

I have been back 3 times since my last visit and can easily say my last experience isn't the norm. And I haven't seen that waiter since so perhaps he found a job outside of customer service??   I talked to the manager and they were so amazing at handling the situation. Seriously major kudos! I probably wouldn't have been back if it weren't for them and it's now become a spot we frequent. The service has been great ever since as well.   The last 2 times I went I had the pecan crusted steak which is great. My friends all swear by the French onion soup and order it everytime. I'll have to try it next time.  We came in recently again as a group for a going away party for one of my BFFs. We ordered 3 desserts- the crème brulee, the coffee ice cream pie and the brownie sundae. BEST BROWNIE SUNDAE. We all ended up not really even finishing the other desserts because they didn't even compare to that one.   So this is what you should order: French onion soup pecan crusted steak brownie sundae

2 or 3 stars for the pizza, depending on how desperate my cravings are for pizza.  BUT I am giving them 4 stars because I called at 8:50 and ordered a pizza. Little did I know they close at 9. The girl taking my order ran back to make sure they didn't shut off the oven just for me and took my order. Isn't that sweet? I thought it was because she definitely didn't have to do that. She could have easily told me the oven was off.   but will I go back for pizza? probably not. It reminded me of cheap pizza that you get at play places and it was $20 after tip. rip.

I can't remember if it was Iain or Joel who told me to order the cheesesteak after my pizza experience... but whoever it was is my hero. I freakin love it. My friend and I went the other night and he loved it too! Flancers has made my round in places to eat that aren't freaking far away from my dang house. I tested out the curb side awhile back when it was raining and I just loved that. I gave my car hop a little bit extra for having to bring it out in the rain.  She brought it out quickly and my food was piping hot. I think I will try the french onion soup next time i go.

I think I have finally found my 'home' with a bank. I have been with Wells Fargo for 4 years. here is my list of postitives and negatives.  positives: - 24 hr customer service - great online banking - many locations - text banking - free checking for students -upgraded to the next free checking account and now i get free checks too! - AWESOME savings plans. you can set goals, time limits, auto transfers and it will tell you how close you are to your savings goal. i LOVE this feature.   negatives: - you have to have your account number (not your debit card number) when you call. maybe im crazy for not having it memorized but it's a pain in the butt - they charge you for the phone call if they think you could have been able to handle it online yourself( if you call and complain they will usually take care of it) - there is a $10 transfer fee if you move money from your accounts too frequently or if they need to pull from your savings for overdraft protection - when i first opened my account i was ready to start building my credit score but had really young credit and they wouldn't give me a student card without paying a huge down payment first. i went elsewhere to open my first credit card but it would have been nice to have them all on one website. Chase ended up taking a chance on me and I have been with them for a few years now(credit card wise, not checking!) and have been satisfied.

you know how a lot of places will only give you a miniature sprinkle of oreo crumbs for $.50 and you're constantly being a piglet saying "just a littttttttle more"? well not here, bc you can add as many oreo crumbs as your heart desires.

our waiter was awesome!   i had the steak fajitas and they were totally over priced at $18 but some of the best fajitas ive ever had!!! i didn't eat any of the sides or tortillas because the meat portion was so large and that was my favorite part.  (that's what she said!)    this is a fox concept i will happily, HAPPILY go to. scrumptious.

I do not have a clue how this place has an average 4 star rating. seriously people, 4 stars? I am mad at all of you.  allow me to break it down for yall.    this place blows. the only thing saving them are their amazing chairs. and in full disclosure, this place has the best chairs i've ever used. i say that everytime but this time i'm super serious. like, it was making me laugh and i had no control over it. that's how good it felt. the chairs deserve 5 stars.  but their nail polishes all looked old- crusty and in need of some serious help.   and when i went to set my purse down behind my chair- there was no place to hang or set my purse. all I saw behind the chair were MASSIVE dust bunnies. like, so large i'm surprised they weren't hopping around and mating. on second thought, maybe they were mating like bunnies bc there were a TON of dust bunnies back there.   they told us to sit down after we picked out our color but waited 10 minutes to turn on our water. I get they were busy but some water would have been nice to start prepping our feet.  then my lady hurt my toe. that's not as important bc that happens sometimes but she really hurt my toe :( woe is me.  then we saw a lady with foil on her fingernails so we started asking our girls what that was. they told us it was for the gel nail polish and we started asking questions because we were interested in maybe doing it. but in the middle of our question asking they start ignoring us and began having their own conversation in vietnamese. it was really really rude. so we stopped asking questions about it and figured we'd get it done elsewhere.  THEN once my toes were done my friend decided she wanted a different color and asked me to grab one from up front. being the awesome friend i am i got out of my massage chair to grab another color. when i sat back down.....  brace yourselves because this part is gross....  when i sat back down i looked at the bottom of my newly pampered feet. and. they. were. BLACK on the bottom.   my feet don't even look like that if i walk on the pavement in my neighborhood barefoot!   DISGUSTING. filthy. blech.   and to top it off, our pedicures were over $20 each. and that was ZERO upgrages. no callous remover, no design, just the basic.   one dollar sign symbol, yelp?!?! yall are crazy! that is not cheap for a pedicure! one dollar sign symbol means like $15! that's an expensive pedicure for this type of salon.   so the saving grace here- the chairs. but i will never go back. so gross.  and to top it all off, they did a gangster paint job. see pic.

hmmmm. idk. is it a gourmet hot pocket?   i had the bangers and mash. i probably would have liked it a lot more had it not been hot pocket style. the gravy was great. there wasn't a lot of sausage and i love the grilled onions  we also split the pb&j and that was alright. i liked the rasberry jam. but idk, the whole wrapping everything in a dough sorta turned me off. not sure if i will go back.

I tried this place this morning while baby sitting my two nieces and grandma. I have seen the movie Hotels for Dogs about 47 times in the past two days, and the girls were starting it over. SO I needed to get everyone out before I went crazy. That being said, we found this place on yelp.   The food was super yummy- their bacon is thick and delicious and sausage was sooooo good. It almost seems like they made the sausage themselves. The kids had the french toast- they said they liked ihop's better but i tasted theirs and they don't know what they are talking about. Recipe's french toast is tasty! Way tastier than ihop's.   and they earned their 5th star bc they don't usually do car curbside orders but when I asked they were more than accommodating. (I had grandma and it takes her 45 minutes to get in and out of the car) I will tell my sister to go back for sure! They have these vanilla cinnamon pancakes that sound amazing- next time!

i had no idea this place existed! cute little place on a great patio over looking a lake. you feel like you've left AZ.   their food is mediocre and it's nothing fancy. literally, their calamari is basically just fish sticks if that gives you any idea. we ordered chips and queso (decent), chicken strips w fries (delicious), quesadilla (good) and few other items.   But the casual setting with the great view makes it a super nice spot to come for lunch and hang out for a bit. they also had a great bar area so even if you don't want to eat, this is a great drinking spot  i would totally go back!

this place is my new jam! i can't get enough!   we sat on the charming patio near the fire place and the patio warmers. it was so cozy cute back there! it felt like i was somewhere else, like a vacation.   we did the bottle of the moscato d'asti. my friend wanted a pinot but i was so excited when I saw that they had my fav moscato that she let me order that for us.  what a great friend i have!   for the bruschetta we tried these (rated orgasmic to just tasty):  1. prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone- so good i bought the ingredients and made it for myself the next day.  2. tomato jam and sheeps milk cheese- the cheese was nice and salty and the jam was sweet. perfect harmony.  3. salami with pesto- this was good, i might not order it again but i might. i wasn't the biggest fan of the salami they used but it was good.  4. white bean with chopped tomato- this one was good but tasted like traditional bruschetta and we were looking for the funky. so probably won't order this one again unless i'm in the mood for traditional bruschetta.   we also ordered the autostrada panini to split but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. we wound up taking that home. it was quite tasty.  the only issue we had was when the bill came. they charged everything a la carte and forgot to apply the tuesday special ($20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta)  but they more than made up for it. they felt so bad, fixed it right away and comped our sandwich.   love this place.

MOJO sets itself apart from other yogurt places in a major way.  the space- it is so pretty! i love it in there.  the hands-free sanitizer- thank you the EASE of getting a sample- amen  making your dream smoothie- what a genius concept. haven't done it yet but today is tuesday.  Twitter Tuesdays- that's whats up.  The ingredients are so fresh- in fact the last time I was there I saw them slicing fruit.  and most importantly, the employees. SERIOUSLY! how in the world did you find such awesome people?!?! other yogurt shops need a lesson from yall.  $.42 an oz is a bit higher than other stops but i never feel ripped off. in fact, i am now questioning how legit the other shops scales are. either way, if you go on Tuesday there is no way you will find a better deal.   I always leave happy and you will too.

People who compare qdoba to chipotle are seriously handicap.   There are similarities but not enough to justify this statement.   If I would have gotten a burrito and not seen it made I probably would have given it 4 stars because it's pretty tasty. (I was starving while pre thx giving shopping so I actually ate it, had I not been so hungry I would have left after looking at the food display)  Everything had been sitting out so long it had a film, the guacamole was brown and crusty looking, everything else was splattered around the tins and left long enough for it to crust up. I came at 7 so that's a normal dinner time, even if it was slow you should be wiping all that crust crap. I think she saw the look of nasty on my face and tried to stir everything up but it was too late.   The sweet girl working was like once you taste this you'll want to come back once a week. Hmmm maybe if things were fresh!   Then when I got my drink there were lids in the lid dispenser that were filthy! They were brown- I was like "did someone step on these and put them back?"   5star service 4 star taste Negative stars for freshness Negative stars for cleanliness  I probably won't be back unless they make some serious changes.  Too bad bc it was cheap and pretty flavorful

THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE LATE NIGHT DELIVERY!!!!   I was sooo stoked to hear they deliver...until 3am. WOW! They have a late night special for $5- it's a gyro w fries from 11pm until 3am. it was super yummy. There is a $10 minimum delivery and everything is cheap and inexpensive. (just re-reading my review and wondering what the difference between cheap and inexpensive is? hehe) cheap and delicious***   so many late night delivery places are just nasty and blech. this one was super enjoyable.    I love you, oliveo. will you be my bff4l?

so, i finally had my experience. the best food, i have eaten, thus far in my life.    i literally couldnt even handle the amazingness of the cochinita. it was, well, amazing.  while eating the elote i kept saying shut up. but no one was talking? thats how good it was. my friend asked if it was for real.  both of our faces were covered in corn juice and our teeth full of corn bits. oh, yes, it is for real.   the service was awesome too. our waiter was so great. he let me 'taste' the agua frescas. ummm YUM!   we ordered the chips and salsa too- the bomb dot com for sure.   i need to go like everyday. and i will. jk i wont but i'll think about it daily.

Toby Keith's I don't Like This Bar.   thankfully i'm a girl and it was free to get in or i'd be angry! the poor guys who have to pay. that's so dumb.   it was basically impossible for anyone to get served here. everyone at the bar was getting irritated because no one could get drinks and when you'd place an order you'd have to wait forever again just to get the drink. same story when you're ready to close your tab. either their bartenders are horrible or they're insanely under-staffed.   regardless we left because it was horrible.

I am SO glad they opened this location. so close to my home and office!!! Today was the grand opening (they're serving free coffee until 10pm so head out)   The line was long but they have the friendliest people working there handing out stickers, menus, tons of cool stuff. They were chatting it up and you could tell they loved being there and working there.   I was going to get myself a free cup (my fav is the choco macadamia nut) and buy a few co-workers a cup, we needed coffee!  I got them the Kaluha and the Double Chocolate, they loved it.   and the best part? they didn't charge me for any of them!! I thought that was so awesome! I was totally willing to pay for theirs!   Just an awesome company with amazing coffee, you def need to check them out. I can't get over how friendly and funny the people who work there are.

I think I'm way too Americanized for this place.   It's stinky and filthy. There were unsanitary things every which way I looked. There were these buckets full of veggies soaking in a liquid, i really can't think of any other way to describe it. There were tongs just laying on top of this filthy rusty shelf and I guess you were supposed to grab the liquidy items and put them into a bag? (see pics)   This white girl just couldn't handle it.   There was some sort of ceiling issue bc there was a lot of drippage. all over their products. see pics.   But you can get a crap ton of basil for $1.50. My friends swear by this place, so if you're adventurous like them hit it up!

if you haven't eaten lunch yet, i suggest you get your cute little butt over to sonora right now.   i had the carne asada taco combo on flour tortillas. It comes with two tacos and rice and beans. I also got fresh guac. aaannnnd i was coaxed into the mexican version of bingsoo (the mexican version is better in my opinion)   I had to get it to-go and head back to work... and since my hands were full of that delicious little fruity icee treat, the lovely lady working carried my lunch to my car. how stinking sweet is that? she didn't want it to spill, however, spills were the theme of the day.  as soon as i got in my car i forgot about that fruity concotion and stuck my elbow in it. and it tipped over and fell.  then i took a sip of my drink and that went down the front of my shirt. did i mention i was wearing white?   the tacos were amazing, and the beans were amazing, and the rice too. I could have used a little more heat and I am sure if I used the salsas it would have been perfect, but i didn't want to spill that all over the place so they stayed closed.   the fruity dessert thing that i got was so delicious. she made me a special concotion. it was shaved ice with coconut, mango and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. if she could have just blended that with a little rum it would have been the perfect mid-work cocktail. they should seriously start blending that little treat. amazing.   next time i will go back when i have time to sit and enjoy, i will also bring a bib with me since i can't seem to avoid making a huge mess all over myself.  love this place. delcious.

my nieces were over this past weekend and wanted pizza. since i am such an awesome aunt, i agreed.   i hate all of the pizza places that are in my area so i wanted to try a new place. North Mesa, let me introduce you to Mike. Mafia Mike.   we ordered one large pizza, half pepperoni, half cheese. and two homemade chocolate chip cookies.  the pepperoni was huge and nice and spicy. the sauce wasn't bad either. not my favorite but definitely good enough to be a regular. so far this pizza joint trumps all of the other pizza places in this part of town.   the cheese was great and the crust was good, thin but not crackery. the people answering the phone and taking orders are super nice and so are the delivery guys.   the cookies were the highlight. so stinkin delicious. and it's free delivery! my favorite kind of delivery! *(now that venezia's is open they are the 2nd best option)*

2 words? creamy dream. get your head out of the gutter.   i'm on a yogurt kick, and this place is across the street from my office. that's not why i gave it 5 stars though.   I gave it 5 stars bc the vanilla yogurt is EXTRA vanilla-y. the blackberries are so plump. I have never seen strawberries so red. and kiwi so firm.   when i leave i feel like skipping with my yogurt. only $4 for a cup filled to the top with the freshest fruit and the most vanilla-y vanilla ever?? I understand that tart is the new trend, but my sour face is not attractive.   and this is going to sound bananas- but  their yogurt isn't too cold. it's the perfect temperature to taste all of the goodness and not give your tongue freezer burn.   I won't lie- i've been replacing my lunch lately with this creamy dream. so worth it. and the fact that it's fat free and mostly fruit takes away some of that guilt.

i love chipotle. i love that when i go here my most difficult question is chicken or barbacoa? always happy with my meal.   with that said...  talk about age discrimination. they just started doing a kids meal. it comes with a small taco or quesadilla (a few other things to choose from), two sides plus chips and a drink. for some crazy $3 amount. i am very jealous of all the young people now.   a lady in front of me tried to cheat this kid meal system and man did the people working there handle it poorly. they were clearly talking about her while she stood right there, awkwardly waiting and pretending like she didn't understand why she didn't get her sides and drink. um ya, because its a kids meal crazy lady, you're like 30, sorry you're short but you don't pass for an 11 year old.   but ok chipotle, people. get over it. give her what she thought she was getting and let her know they cant give her a kids meal next time but they will let it slide this time. they held up the entire line while we all got to experience this awkwardness. i was embarrassed for her. i was nervous waiting in line. all i could think was 'do they need to make this so uncomfortable?'   i say no more age discrimination, we should all be allowed to comfortably order the smaller portions. and lady in line before me- next time order by phone to go. that is the proper way to cheat the system.

first words out of my mouth after entering this location: "it doesn't smell like mildewed clothes in here!!!!"   three cheers for cleanest goodwill i've ever been to.  this place was amazing! cara and i came here looking for a project. the furniture selection was crummy. we were hoping to find a wood table or night stand or something maybe with drawers. no luck. it was mostly plastic faux wood.   we did find a ton of other amazing things for a different type of project. a guy behind us in line found citizens jeans w the tags still on them.   tons of board games w all the pieces. really, really great good will. my fav so far!

i dug it. their hotdogs are bomb. they are using vienna, i believe. and they come on buttered toasted bread. i get mine w grilled onions on top.  their fries are some of the best EVER. super thin, perfectly crisp, and perfectly seasoned. The seasoning tastes a bit garlicky and not sure what else was in it.   the burgers are not as good as culvers but they are good.   and the custard is pretty tasty

I LOVE this salon.   They are so friendly, clean and do a great job.   They have a ton of colors to choose from, they are inexpensive, the chairs are among the best, the foot rubs are great, and they seriously scrub your feet. no need for callous remover here!   This is my new favorite place for a pedicure. As much as I try new salons, I don't think it gets better than this. Thankfully it's right up the street from my house!

i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner.   i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week.   i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting)  my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top.   mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.  the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.  the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio.   and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount!   today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.   i love this place!

Mike Fish is the owner and installer.   Here is the list of everything he is able to do: Surround sound systems Computers Wireless networks Home theater Remote control Wall mount TVs  I am SO pleased with the work he did. He is so friendly, professional and I am pretty sure he left my house cleaner than when he came :)   I have a 55in flat TV that needed to be hung above the fireplace. I didnt want to see ANY wires, not even a little peek. i hate wires.   so Mike came over to give me an estimate and to take a look at the project. We decided to cut through the dry wall and put the wires behind the wall that way. I am one to get estimates, save up the amount, and then schedule. So it took me awhile to schedule him to come out but he held onto his original quote which I appreciate.   He brought his son and they were both just a pleasure to have in my home while they worked. Very polite and just enjoyable.   They got to my house around 1:45 pm and were finished before 5:30.   Now once everything is hooked up and ready to go you expect services to be complete, but not Mike. Let's just have a look at how above and beyond he went:  -He went through and named all of my inputs so I would know which was DVD, which was satellite, etc.  - The wall mount I use to hang my dvd player and receiver on has a small wooden box to cover the back to hide wires. With all the new wires it wouldn't go down all the way so Mike got out his already packed tools and cut out an insert for me.  - he vacuumed any mess up that was left - and the last one I can think of is lending his ladder to my painter. I was having an estimate done to have the exterior of my house painted and he needed an extra tall ladder to check something out. Mike heard him talking and immediately offered his ladder for him to use. SO nice!   great morals and a work ethic that is hard to find from people these days. Mike and his son (Ben) really know how to take care of their customers! I will only be using Mike in the future and giving out referrals like crazy for anyone who is needing a similar service.   ps- he also does computer IT projects.

if you want to fit in san tan valley here is a step by step guide.  1. be really proud of yourself for buying a super cheap house in the middle of nowhere. but don't tell anyone the location bc the moment you do people are less impressed.... and more turned off.   2. bc of #1, you can afford rims on your car. be sure to buy the ugliest  ones possible. people here prefer black rims with chrome outline.  3. roll down your windows  4. tune your radio to rap music   5. blast it really loud  6. drive with your left arm only, straight out, and lean back. be sure you wear your wrist watch on this arm so that others can see it out your window. bonus points if you wiggle your wrist pretending to adjust the watch, but really you just want it to sparkle under the light.  im not exaggerating, we saw about 10 different cars like this while eating our china chef.   (i just checked out someone's profile who lives in san tan valley. first person i clicked on listed interest: purple drank. what are the chances? i rest my case.)  this whole review is an embarrassment, but it must be said.   don't ask why i was in this part of town last night, but i was. and we were waiting for a long time in this shopping center and hadn't had dinner. china chef of burger king? china chef it is!   the food wasn't disgusting, actually it was just meh but edible and better than BK (on 2nd thought, maybe if i find myself in that horrible town/shopping center i will do BK). the space was clean and blah blah blah.    that's not the problem. the problem is that the meal doesn't come with a gas mask for later. and my body wasn't the only one having issues with this food. for the record, i've eaten my fair share of questionable food and i have never had a reaction like this.   shhuuuuuuuuu-weeeeeeeee.

not a fan.  i truly believe people are tricked by the decor. it really does make you feel cute and happy, but it's like a wolf in sheeps clothing bc the food and service suck. this applies to every fox concept, i've decided.   our waiter was a diva, and not in a good way. he rolled his eyes at me several times and all i did was ask for lemon with my water. then i asked for vinegar and oil on the side instead of on my salad. it came on my salad so i asked politley if i could have a new side salad. he got so pissed and grabbed my plate without saying anything. when he returned he just slammed it down in my face. i would have walked out if i wasn't with people. i hate rude servers.   then i ordered the kobe burger and it was burnt on the outside.  and it had no flavor. i had to salt and pepper the crap out of it.    last time i pay $17 for a gross burger and rude service, i don't care how effing cute your patio is.

holy moly- a fox concept i like?!   well, i've always loved the design of the restaurants, but never the food. Modern Steak is next door and is now my inspiration for my backyard design. It's eye candy for sure. Sorry- back to modern burger.   This place is so well priced for what you get. and it's tasty! it sorta tastes like a better version of in n out to me. The meat patties are thick and juicy, and the bun is so buttery. the grilled onions are my favorite touch. i'm sure my clients love my onion breath, too. i'm kidding, i wisp after lunch. (BTW- highly recommend wisps)  the fries are so good- they were crunchy. I don't know if that was on purpose but I love crunchy fries that have a little fluff in the middle. divine.   I had a bite of one of their ice cream cookie sandwiches and highly recommend that you pass on getting one. not a fan.  there are, however, two things i would add or change: 1. how is american a modern cheese? havarti is more posh :)  2. a to-go phone #- i could take a lunch break in 5 minutes if i was able to call my order ahead for pick up. plus it makes sense being in the mall with all the retail workers. their lunch breaks are short.

9.88 for shoes??? you are whistling my tune!!   MOST and i repeat MOST of the shoes are SUPER fugly, ghetto, and cheap looking. like so, so fugly. but some of them are awesome! and let's be honest, this place is basically across the street from a strip club and it's hella hood.....like, the girls in there may or may not have blue leopard print acrylic nails. but that's neither here nor there.   this is about cheap shoes, and when it comes to cheap shoes you really can't be a complainer and you gotta know what you're getting. your shoes will not be badgley mischka (which, btw, last chance has a ton of right now). these shoes are what i like to call 'throw aways' so get those balls out of your mouth and grab a new pair of sandals for the summer!  i got a pair of metallic thong flats and these super cute blue heels...they were velvet-y :) and super cute. and $10 so if they fall apart it's no sweat! but I think these will last a decent amount of time, i was bending them and smacking them against the counters...you know, testing them out, they are pretty tough.   i don't like to wear my good shoes out so this is the perfect solution. so long as you don't buy the ugly crap. there were MAYBE 5 pairs of cute shoes in the whole store....maybe. the rest reminded me of strippers or bro-hos.   worth checking out for sure!

I must have looked like a poor, ugly person the other day bc seriously NO ONE helped me. no one even said hi. I was in there for an hour too.   I decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad.   this is a little bit like OJ's "i didnt kill my wife, but if I did this is how I would do it" in that if someone had helped me I would have bought 6 place settings- mats, chargers, napkins and napkin rings. I also would have bought several drapery panels.   but no way was I going to spend that much money at a place that couldn't even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help.   so i just set everything I had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left. you're welcome employees, hope you had fun putting everything away. i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me.

I was THISCLOSE to tears. tears of happiness.   I am a fan of HGTV and they are always freakin talking about the Homegoods Store. I was so sad thinking that we didnt have one and I hated their website bc you can't buy anything on it. So I just decided there was no hope.   Then, after class one night i was driving and lit up like angels calling my name, i saw it. Homegoods. connected to TJ Maxx. I went bananas.   Today I finally had the chance to shop so I went. for 3 hours. i'm not lying. yes, that was me, i was the girl with 2 shopping carts giving the stink eye to anyone eyeing something that i was eyeing. watch out- thats mine!!!!!   I filled up my trunk- then my backseat and I still have a few more things to pick up manana. I can't wait.   and the best part? I only spent like $300 on an entire car full of goods!!! my entire guest room is totally decorated now, my master has all of it's little pieces and i am so stoked. I also found some things for my backyard.   I can't wait to go back when it's time to do my office! but that project is a bit down on my priority list.   homegoods is what's up. the lady was THISCLOSE to convincing me to sign up for their credit card to save 10%....maybe i should............

Ya, I have a problem, I know it. I went back and bought more. almost everything i bought was from Z Gallerie. Um, never shopping at Z again- I'll just head to homegoods.   BTW- they get another shipment in today- i called and asked. you can laugh at me.  so pretty much you can find me there this weekend. my walls are still a bit bare.   you might call me obsessed bc i have seriously been considering hitting up each location this weekend, as everyone carries different things. however, i am really sick and don't know if i have the strength. i will try.   just a shout out to the people working here- thanks for helping load everything in my car, both times. let's make it a 3rd this weekend?

meh.  loved the interior but the menu didn't have many options. i was really hoping for an amazing salad but none of their salads sounded good.   and what we did order wasn't impressive. i'll give it another try sometime but for now, meh.

I went here for a large get together over the weekend. Our waitress was really great considering the large, drunk group. :)   The only thing I didn't like was the lack of fountain diet coke. It came in a cute mexican glass bottle but i prefer my diet coke to come from a fountain. I'm crazy like that. Other than that, the glass did pour me 3 refills which was PLENTY so i didn't feel jipped......except by the lack of extra bubbles that comes from a fountain cola, but i digress.  I had this amazing salad. it had artichoke hearts, pine nuts, onions, mozarella, and leafy greens. top notch. everyone elses food looked amazing too. especially that damn hotdog. i wish they had a few more menu options unrelated to sandwiches or salads, but i definitely recommend. super good.

normally i wouldn't write a review for an AT&T store because they're usually about the same. to-be expected service, to-be expected answer, it's usually pretty much the same.  that was until my AT&T world was rocked.   i was really regretting not getting the 60-something gig iphone5.  i decided to sell my 32g on craigslist and started calling around ATT stores to find the next up.  everyone was out of the 60-something gig iphone and no one knew where to find one. all the stores i called basically said calling around myself was the best way to find one because they have no way of tracking them.   until Jaime answered my call. he took down my number and got to hunting FOR ME. he found one some how somewhere and told me he could have it at his store within the hour.  WHAT?! ok magic man!   come to find out he picked it up himself and brought it to the store. when i got there he traded out my old cell case for a brand new one and gave me some of the best customer service i have ever had.  he was friendly and really went out of his way.   even after i finished my purchase he was willing to answer questions for the guy who purchased my phone from craigslist.   jaime is worth the drive. the other guys who were working were also SO friendly. two of them were going on their lunch and offered to get me a soda...and i wasn't even their customer. seriously. so nice.   and i know it was genuine bc i did NOT look cute that day.

"i want my feet to be so smooth that i slip and fall when i take a shower"   ask and you shall receive!   i have not had a pedicure like this in forever. i get a pedicure typically every 2 weeks and always get callous remover bc i like baby-bottom soft feet. they pull out all the stops here to get your feet soft: they used this razor skin scraper and i'm not even sure it's legal but i'm not saying a word, then a bunch of scrubbers and other scrapers, gizmos and gadgets galore.     also, i like my toes to look wet long after they dry and so far so good on that aspect.  the chairs were amazing. sometimes the pedicure places have these awful chairs, but these seriously feel like someone is giving you a back massage. not back vibrations, but like actual kneading into your muscles. there were times my friend and i had to stop mid sentence because it felt so good. it probably sounded like we were having sex up in there.  my feet tingled for a few hours after the pedicure.  i might be ditching my old 'regular' spot and making this the new place. they even had cutie little kid pedicure chairs so your favorite little girl (or gay-ly forward son- whatever floats your kids' boat) can join you when you go.   ps- this isn't the fanciest salon i've been to, but they really get down and dirty to get your feet looking amazing. and the price is right- $16 for a regular pedicure, or $25 for a ped w callous remover and sugar scrub.

This place is awesome!!!  It is reasonably priced and the girls who work here are polite and hilarious. They have great senses of humor and kept us laughing. They definitely took our lead when it came to conversation, when we were quiet they let us have peace but when we started convo they jumped right in.   It was super, super clean. They had a great variety of top end nail polishes and they did a great job on all 3 of us.   Highly recommend.

There were two things I was disappointed with:  - lack of fresh fruit options: most were either canned or frozen and a few were fresh. my favorite yogurt places have super fresh fruit and thats my favorite part, so I was super bummed to see their fruit selection look a little syrupy/previously frozen. They also didn't have kiwi and that's one of my favorite toppings. The strawberries were definitely fresh, the blackberries were frozen and a bit mushy. the rest of the fruit didn't look appetizing   - the price. Either their yogurt and fruit are heavier than other places or they charge more. I am used to paying right around $4- give or take a dollar-at most places for what i usually build. I usually do a little yogurt and then i pile on the fruit. I had a $1 off coupon and my total was just under $7. Yikes!!   They had quite a bit larger of a selection of toppings than other places and that was cool- it was mostly candy options for the sweet toothed. They also had cake cones and waffle cones which i haven't seen at other places.   I would come back with kids because of all the candy choices but i probably wouldn't be back on my own since they don't have the fresh fruit options that i like.  and i'm knocking down a star for the fake reviews.

They really took my review to heart and I love a business that takes complaints seriously!   The price is a bit more than other yogurt places- I think $.36 per ounce- not huge but it makes a difference.   The space is super cute and they are getting more fresh fruit options which is great. The "fake" reviews are gone and the owner is now participating on yelp and learning about their clients.   HUGE improvements!! I hope they stick around because they have the market on yogurt in this location- and sometimes you just need a good yogurt place near by. Keep up the good work!

well hello addiction. this deliciousness has become a regular in my belly. i have a thing for their yellow curry chicken. it is so flipping good. I used to eat at Chars Thai in Tempe but since they closed I haven't found a place I liked as well. But I can say I like papaya thai a bit more.    the chicken pieces are so moist and everything is cooked in the open kitchen to order so it is insanely fresh. i have tried the regular yellow curry and the mango yellow curry. i like the regular the best, but the mango is good too if you like fruit in your curry. the veggies are colorful and fresh and cooked just the way i like. not soggy but not too crispy. perf.   they have a star scale on spicy, i go with a 4. and 4 basically means my nose will run a bit but i won't die. im willing to try the level 5, thats my next visit. keep in mind, i have a high tolerance for spice bc i love spicy food. if you're a wimp go with a 2.   The space is clean and very comfortable, but very tacky in the usual asian restaurant way. it never seems to be too busy in there but i really hope business picks up because i want them to stay around. however, my addiction could probably support them.   i have to note the sweet sticky rice dessert. i love it. i get the sticky rice with mango- it is bananas good.   if you're in this part of town, it's definitely worth visiting. i would actually suggest it before most of the other places near here. munch up my curry friends.

yummy! i had the yellow chicken curry lunch special, level 3 heat. not spicy at all so next time i'll try it at 4. it came with egg drop soup which was mediocre after adding soy sauce(so i guess it was only good after adding something to make it taste like something else therefore skip the soup), a salad, plus the entree and choice of rice.   it was pretty inexpensive, like just under $9. good deal.   it was tasty, fast, and clean. i'll be back!

Venezia must have heard my cry for a location over here. That's probably one of the first things I said after moving to this part of town. "they should open a venezias'   They opened on Thursday and I probably had tears of joy. This is my favorite delivery, by the slice pizza in AZ.   the crust is thin, the sauce is tangy, the cheese is stretchy, and it pretty much has everything i love about pizza.   I am sad about the delivery charge, it always makes me confused. do i tip? how much do i tip if they already charged me? should i not tip?   whatever, as longs as i have a place to go when i crave pizza

green chiles on a burger SOUNDS good, but not when the burger isn't very good.   i asked the guy what he recommended and he told me 'fries'. um, ok. but he ended up being right. after i wasn't a fan of my burger i ate a few of the fries and some of my $.99 rootbeer float.   both of those are good. i probably won't be back just because i don't really want either of those on a regular basis, especially when the main dish isn't very good.   those should be delicious compliments to a delicious burger, but not the only thing likable.   in thought, a burger is relatively easy to make it delicious. it's pretty cut and dry but for some reason so few places can make a decent burger.

this place is going to give yogurtland a run for their money!   the yogurt is just as tasty and creamy and the toppings are BETTER. as in, toasted coconut. do any of the other amazing full sized candy bar toppings or super fresh fruits even matter once you realize their coconut has been toasted?  if you ever want to win my heart, bring me a vanilla yogurt w strawberries and toasted coconut. there's a joyful hum going on the entire time i eat it.    PLUS 10% off or something if you work in the area, frequent stampers card that you DONT have to carry around in your wallet.  this place is the jam!

do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with our God taken from Micah 6:8 is the church's mission.   i started going to mission and switched my membership from cornerstone (another great church!) several months ago.   this is a casual church...seriously, come as you are. no need to get all snazzy! you are welcome and loved just the way you are.   what drew me to mission was the way sermons are led. other churches i have attended will pick a topic and then apply the bible to the topic...there is nothing wrong with that and it is great as well! but i loved how mission jumps in the bible and then dissects it and applies it to life today. you really get a heavy dose of the Word every sunday and that  was exactly what i was looking for.   i can't tell you how much i have grown since attending! this year, mission is going through the book of john. they took literally all of 2012 to dive into this one book. amazing!   i love that this church is Spirit filled and teaches on listening to the Holy Spirit.   other things i love: their heart for orphans- they've created esther's hope to walk alongside families who want to foster/adopt and also creating opportunities for others to help those who are in the process from baby sitting or running errands or providing any help any way possible..including classes for the families, etc. it's awesome.   their heart for the community- every 3rd sunday (i think) mission collects non perishable items to donate and give back to the community. the congregation is one of the major contriubtors and have donated tens of thousands of pounds of food. i actually met another member who coupons solely for bringing items to donate to the church. the people here really care and aren't doing it just out of obedience or good works...it's because they truly love others and i love that! and this is just ONE example. they are passionate about helping the community in many ways.   their heart for missions- they are involved in many mission organizations not only locally but across the globe from short term to long term missionaries. they really partner with you to make a difference in the world.   this church is unique and i am so glad i was able to find a new church home. there are many things to love about mission and it's worth checking out.

When I was a kid I lived in this small neighborhood in the bay area. I used to grab money from my moms purse and then walk up the street and find ways to spend my money. There was a circle K, a hair salon, a video store complete with a beaded curtain section (of which my step brother was a fan. I know this bc I was a snoop), aaaaaand a donut shop.   It as an oriental run donut shop and those always seemed to be the best in my experience of eating donuts while living in the bay. they had a mean maple bar. It wasn't overly sweet and had a perfect amount of saltiness and chewy-ness while remaining fluffy and moist. it was a great donut and what I consider a 'bay area style donut'  for no other reason except that i ate this kind of donut while i lived in the bay area. i didn't think anyone else made donuts like this.  until I arrived at Bosa. it's run by orientals which is a good sign when it comes to donuts so I tried a maple bar. oh my gosh! the donut brought back all of those memories of tattling on my step brother when I found his naughty movies and regretting my choice to get a perm at the hair salon once while bored.   this is a bay area style donut! it's not krispy kreme(which is also a delicious donut) and it's not dunkin (which isn't a delicious donut) it's a different donut class of its own.  if you like them chewy and fluffy while a tad sweet and salty go here for your donut pleasure!

very, very cool.  neat little gallery with the option to use their painting room. i love to paint but i hate buying paints and i hate worrying about getting it on stuff in my house. so this was PPPEEEEERFECT for me.   i went in with a friend and we went to town. i bought a 16x20 canvas for $20 and painted a masterpiece. this is way better than as you wish bc i was seriously running out of random ceramic things to paint. now i can make my own artwork which i just love because i am AMAZINGLY talented. i will totally make you a canvas too, no big deal ;) i'll even sign it.   i have one wall that i would love to make a piece of artwork for but it requires a super large canvas so next time i am going to call to see if he'd let me use his space but bring my own canvas and i'll pay whatever fee he wants.   they offer classes as well and you can BYOB.   after this, i downloaded the Joann app on my phone for a 50% off coupon and i bought a frame for my new artwork. it's now framed and hung in my house.

Scrum diddly!  2 of us ate for $21  I had the red chile w cheese-- added the lettuce, sour cream, onion and tomatoes.   We split the honey/powdered sugar fry bread.   Tons of food! Friendly and quick service. Hard to find, literally right off Stapley in an odd shopping plaza. Don't let that deter you!  It is nothing fancy, just yummy food!!

Every year I am in charge of bringing dessert from a local spot for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Last year we did an ice cream pie from Sweet Republic and that was good.   But this year was different...  This year we sorta flipped out when we tasted our creme brulees. We ordered a few pumpkin and then got a ton of different flavors so we could try them all.   We sat in a circle and just passed them around going to town. They were all amazing. The winners though, were the classic vanilla and chocolate. As in, the kids were licking the containers. We didn't even think the kids would like them but they couldn't get enough.   We loved it so much we are even doing it twice- Christmas here we come!   I had the order delivered to my work, it came wrapped in a bow with an adorable re-usable container full of raw sugar for flaming. We used the broiler because our torch was out of gas and it turned out wonderful. I did a test on one of the brulees to get the hang of it. Prep time was about 15 minutes to do all 12 brulees. it was amazing.   Julia is such a pleasure to work with as well. She is always quick to respond to e-mails and was right on time!

i went here for a friend's birthday brunch! it was located behind the denny's and in the same center as peter piper pizza. google maps takes you across the street just FYI :)   everyone loved the monte carlo sandwich. it was a hit!   our server was super friendly. they had a huge assortment of GF options and also listed other potential allergens in their food on the menu (egg, soy, etc)   in addition to their menu, they had a bakery to take home some goodies as well as pre packed mixes to make the bread and I assume other GF baked goods yourself. they also sell their GF flour.  apparently, if you have a gluten allergy...according my friend this is the best and most delicious option she's been able to find!

this place is so much fun!!!!!!!! we went here as part of my birthday celebration month.   we had a mix up with our reservations which was a huge bummer but Rudy took such great care of us. he was super apologetic, bought all 12 of us a round of drinks while we decided what we wanted to do, gave us all free passes to the game room and comped our two lanes when they finally opened up.   we almost left when we found out about the mix up but i am so glad we stayed. it was my first time there and because of the delay we got to enjoy the whole lucky strike experience. we got the games, the dance floor, the food, the drinking and the bowling in.   i usually don't like bowling but this was such a blast. the service was great throughout the whole place. once we wrapped up our game we headed to copper blues. it was so nice having lots of fun things to do in one small area.   highly recommend for parties and thumbs up to the amazing staff.

I haven't been ice skating since 8th grade when I owned the rink at polar ice. Thankfully, I was skating with a 5 year old who had never worn skates before so I got to play it cool and save my ego.   "let's hang on to the side and go really slow until you get the hang of it"  "I got it already, let's go faster" "no no, safety first. hold my hand while I clench for life to this rail. it's for your safety!"   We had so much fun on the miniature skating rink.   It really was teeny.   but it was so much fun! skating outside, trees lit up, carolers singing, a small little coffee booth. and it was only $10 per person.   Even Santa came out to skate.

This was my 2nd time using this awesome and friendly clinic to get my shots before going overseas.   Eileen was referred to me by a friend. I am so glad she did because Eileen is SO knowledgeable and she doesn't try to sell you or scare you into getting every shot under the moon. She has a good sense of what is super necessary, what she might suggest as extra depending on different environments.   She is also able to prescribe my sleeping pills for my flights and my anti malaria meds which is great because that's one less appointment for me! There are a few different types of anti malaria meds and she is helping me navigate that decision before I leave.   The office is insanely friendly and everyone working there is so awesome. I just want to hang out with everyone! Highly recommend.

i don't get it.  our service was no bueno. our waiter rarely came around and kept forgetting things. also, they tried dusting our booth in the middle of our meal. i thought that was extremely tacky, it wasn't even close to closing or anything. they just felt like dusting over our dinner?   they claim to be super healthy and fresh, but start to ask questions about the ingredients and freshness and you'll find out everything is rubbed in sugar and everything is frozen or pre-made.   i went with the pork with haricot verts. i ordered it medium but it was well done and very dry. he sat my plate down and immediately said 'they over cooked it, would you like me to take it back?'   1. why would he bring it out if it was wrong? 2. obviously, he didn't want to fix it or he wouldn't have even brought it to me....so i didn't send it back and i just added some salt to help it out. and i didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.  so the price, combined with the food, and the bad service- i won't be going back.

hahahahahahaha. hahah. ha.  we were offered 4 free drink tickets from some guy in the street while we were out and about that night....and like any self respecting women, we fully accepted this payment method. i *guess* we could make arrangements to squeeze in an appearance.   after taking one look around at the San Jose-esque crowd and the filthy floors and gross dudes using their iphones to film the go-go dancers, the conversation was like:  'let's get our drinks and leave' 'chug'   so we were in and out in about 5 minutes, and as we left we scurried past the guy who paid us in drink tickets.

um wow  i was a bit nervous trying this place for lunch since everyone says it's so slow but we took a risk and we told our waitress we were on a lunch break. she was so awesome about it! we were in and out of there in an hour, with to-go iced teas to boot.   seriously awesome! like, so awesome we went twice in a row. this is a frequenter.  i had the roasted chicken with tomatoes, spinach and artichoke with a side salad. it was delicious.   my friend had the mushroom and chicken crepes which she said were insane. and our other friend had the shrimp salad, also good. but from my eyes i would say my meal and the crepe meal looked the most delicious.   i wish my backyard looked like their patio. im going to spend the rest of my afternoon pretending i'm still out there relaxing.

shellac and a great pedicure. they are able to do the shellac (gel nails) on both your manicure and pedicure which is hard to find. i also love the girls working here.   it's a family run business and it's stuck in this random empty shopping center, you would never expect it or see it but it's always packed.   since i've been trying to hunt down a new salon, this is so far my new favorite and the first one i am making a 2nd visit to.   definitely recommend.

Lisa is just the best! I have used her several times and I'm always happy with the results.   She is competitive with her pricing and comes to your house! She always seems to do something a little extra too! Just today when I got my dog back she had purple toe nails!! Everyone in the house loved it! So stinking cute!   Lisa LOVES dogs too and it shows! She is so sweet!! So thankful we have Lisa and can't recommend her enough!

$12 for turkey burger sliders would be worth it if they were good.  it was just ground turkey thrown on the grill. no seasoning. totally bland.   my friend said her $17 salad was miserable. the shrimp was over-cooked and all she could taste was grill burn marks.  our waitress was MIA and . we won't be back.

happy hour lattes are the gift that keep on giving. and the gifts of love, joy, peace, warmth and happiness and energy...and? idk i'm exaggerating.   i've never had a more delicious latte and i'm finding that it's making me a bit high maintenance. i'm the most unsnobby coffee person but maybe i will be one now? the rest of the weekend, evertime i'd get any form of coffee, i'd be like 'it definitely doesn't compare to what i had at cartel'.   which is why i am going to hold off on my review of echo because i am currently insanely biased and unable to give them a fair shot compared to cartel   who is this coffee snob? jk, i'll still go to town on a folgers anyday.

I had a groupon for a $6 movie plus a free drink.   We split the sausage and mushroom pizza as well as the coconut chicken strips.   Both were good! I would definitely go back to see a movie and have dinner. I didn't think it was that expensive. Not any more than you would spend elsewhere beforehand. Our food came out quickly. The only thing I wasn't sure about were the drink refills. I didn't want to buzz the waiter just for that but they don't refill your drink automatically so you have to buzz them for refills.   There is a fee to reserve your seats online (only a dollar or so) and I think it would be worth it. We waited to pick our seats until we got there and there were only bar tables (office chairs at one long bar across an aisle) and the nicer options only had weird seating locations left.   We opted for the nicer seat option and glad we did. I wouldn't ever want to sit along the bar aisle just because i can totally picture myself leaning forward and resting on the bar top. Plus office chairs aren't all that great. The large leather seats are definitely the way to go.

I don't think $35 is all that expensive for a BJ. (hehehehehe)   No one likes a rushed BJ, and here they really take their time.   Do you like a BJ with lots of product? They have great products. Or if you're like me, I prefer a product free BJ. You know someone is talented when they can achieve great results without using any product at all.  Everyone in the salon looked great after their BJ. You can even enjoy diet coke, an ipad and warm towels during your BJ. Those are just a few things that separate Primp and Blow's BJs from others.   I highly recommend getting a BJ here.

i wish their yogurt were a bit more creamy but they make up for it because they not only have coconut, but they toast it. toasted coconut is by far the best topping and it's how i separate the yogurt places and determine their value.   let me discuss this for a second. plain coconut doesn't even taste like anything! why even offer it unless it's toasted?!  i hate when i ask places if they have toasted coconut and they're all 'no, but we have coconut yogurt' and it's like ummmm have you ever tasted it? it tastes like suntan lotion smells. anyway...moving on...  they always have a ton of fresh berries, candy toppings, and something different i don't see at most places are fruit syrups in addition to the chocolate, caramel and butterscotch goodness.   finally a froyo place semi close to me! they will even give you a ton of stamps on your frequenter card in trade for your old yogurt shop cards. brilliant :)

im on this chile relleno kick. they are so dang good, people.   first of all, this place is a little difficult to find. they are next to Natalia's.  I drove right past them the first time and almost gave up until I called to figure out their location. there's no signage with their business name listed at the shopping center's entrance and there's also no signage above their front door.  just look for natalia's.   the meals are huge! it's like $8. it comes with amazing rice, beans, and your spectacular cheese stuffed green chile smothered in red or green sauce. you get a fantastic tortilla on the side (which i save to make a burro out of the leftovers the next day).   you get warm chips and salsa with your meal as well.   it's an order at the entrance, sit down and get your own salsa type of environment. very casual. very delicious. very affordable.

idk why this place doesn't have 5 stars from everyone?!?! everything is DELICIOUS.  best fajitas in the whole world. not even joking. I have a hard time ordering anything else so I don't. but I have tried other things from friends and everything has been awesome!  they have this tequila-infused butter that they serve with stuff and it's insane. and they have the most delicious onions with their fajitas. the tortillas taste freshly made. the complimentary chips and salsa are super great.    worth coming here for every meal.

Stop what you're doing, north Scottsdale workers. This is your new lunch spot.   My meal was so dang good! I ordered the steak kabob. it came with a skewer of grilled veggies and rice. I substituted my rice for a small salad. It was a bit high for a lunch ($17) but the ingredients are top notch and the service was great. Next time I will order something that fits into my lunch budget. I got to taste their chicken and it is amazing as well and more budget friendly.  The owner came around and chatted with us and shared a little about their history and what their goal is. It's one of the best options nearby that we've found for lunch- actually probably the best we've found within a few miles. Very delicious, clean and friendly.   I highly recommend!

it was hot but i still enjoyed myself!   it was so hot i wasn't really in the mood to keep eating after one taco. i would have liked more shade while standing in line. the parking, for me at least, wasn't bad. i work in that area so i knew of a semi-secrety underground parking area and got a wonderful parking spot just steps from the entrance.  i thought $10 entrance fee was fair but was totally jealous of the people in line who had $5 off tickets. i then spent $10 on taco/drink tickets.   i thought $20 overall was a fair price considering i got to try tacos for places i wouldn't normally get to try. and it was a fun event so it was totally worth the $20 in my opinion.  i will also say that after trying the mission tacos i am in love. and will now make it a priority to head to the mission.  seriously, their pork taco was insane.

i do not know what is wrong with this freaking company.  problem #1- I keep getting past due bills, however, my bank account shows that my payments are made in full. soooooooooo??  problem #2- I open these bills and see that I am being charged for 2 rented receivers- i have 1 receiver which i own, and that is the only one in my house. no idea where this 2nd one is coming from, however, the ppl on the phone seem to know that it's in my other room? UHHH, i have one tv. in my whole house. what tv in what room? have they been to my house? actually, i should invite them over so they can see for themselves. and then i can tar and feather them while they're here.  problem #3- I bought my receiver however they show that I paid $99 and that's the rental price. hmmmmm- my bank account again shows that I paid much more than that.   problem #4- Instead of crediting me for the invisible rental receiver they claim I have, they have been crediting me the rental charges for the receiver I own. UMMMM, no. not only do i need to be credited rental charges for the fake invisible receiver, but also the rental charges for the receiver I own but they think I rent.   Problem #5- I keep getting charged late fees- like I said the money comes right out of my account.   Problem #6- my HD channels stopped working during the 90 day service warranty period so someone had to come out. they charged me for that too. it took a 2 hr phone call to get it reversed.   Problem #7- i just opened my bill, and repeat problem 1-6. still not resolved after 3 phone calls.   this place is nothing but problems. i don't care how much I like the set up of the guide, i will never use directv again. i can put up with it if i didnt have a problem every month and be forced to talk to these people. they just can't seem to do simple billing.

I love Louie!!!! He beats everyone elses price. They are so sweet and delivery is quick and they are gentle. Louie will even search for things for you if he doesnt have them. He was recommended to me and so far I haven't been able to beat his prices or services.   The review below me will definitely make me get copies of all my warranties but that should be a given whenever anyone buys anything.
