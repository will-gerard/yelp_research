My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there.   My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is.

I have never been so underwhelmed on a first visit to a restaurant. The garlic knots were horribly average, the grilled artichoke and Burrata was more like an artiJOKE, and the individual pizza is in a phalic shape and honestly Dominos tastes better than this place. Will not be returning unless it's for drinks if San Tan Brewery is too busy.
