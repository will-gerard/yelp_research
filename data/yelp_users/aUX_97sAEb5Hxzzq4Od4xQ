I've been having a hard time finding great, greasy Chinese food in Phoenix. I have my favorite spots in Tempe, Scottsdale and even Tucson, but in Phoenix I've had no luck. It's funny, I'd expect Phoenix proper to have the best Chinese food out of at least the metro area. But no luck. Uhh well.   Anyways, The Golden Phoenix looked like it was going to be a winner. Good decor and ambiance for a Chinese food restaurant, large menu, great reviews and located in a strip mall (that's where all the best ones are, I'm sure of it).  Sadly, it wasn't as big as a hit as I had hoped.  Ambiance: Great for a chinese good spot Take-Out Service: Eh. I called it in, they said it would take 15 minutes but it ended up taking about 25. When I walked in I was given a cold look by the waitress and pointed to the hostess stand. This could have been because I was wearing sweatpants and a baggy tee, but in my defense,  I had literally just gotten a root canal. Who dresses up after a root canal?  Price: Pretty fair. $20 for an appetizer, soup and main dish.  Food: Crab puffs: DELICIOUS. Perfect texture.  Soup: Not what I expected, but pretty good. I got the egg drop soup. Main Dish: I am a vegetarian so I got the black mushroom and bean curd dish. I think my ordering skills may have been the problem because who orders a dish of all mushrooms? It tasted, well... really, really mushroomy.  And not in a good way. It was kinda gross. I couldn't finish it. I know this doesn't make sense b/c I ordered a mushroom dish so I should expect a mushroom taste,  but there was some kind of funk going on. And there were no other flavors in the dish, just mushroom funk. The tofu, however was cooked well.   Overall, the meal was alright, but kind of a disappointment. I feel this may have been my fault for ordering such a weird dish, so to be fair, I will try it again and let you know what I think.   Just learn from my mistakes, don't order anything mushroomy.

Bruschetta: Great Wine: Great Ambiance: Great Pizza: AMAZING. The Crust! The cheese! The Texture! The perfect taste! yum yum yum!    I typically get the Tricolre and sub tomatoes for the meat. But really, anything you choose is going to be AMAZING.   I will spend my entire life hoping that I can find another pizza place as good as Cibo, and it will never happen.

My friends have all said this place was great, and I was really excited to check it out. Well, it may be really cool, but we had an awful experience with one of the managers from the second we sat down. My boyfriend and I ordered a beer and we were quickly carded (we're 24, but look about 18) which was fine.  I never, EVER mind being carded. I was a server for a long time so I get it.   But the manager walked over and proceeded to interrogate my boyfriend like he was a 15-year old who just snuck into a rated R movie-- just because his ID was a little haggard.  He peaked smugly back and forth from my boyfriend to the ID making rude jokes and belittling remarks. Once he was done with the investigation, and after he had scanned the ID (why he didn't just scan it in the first place, I do not know), he hesitantly handed my boyfriend his card back like he just gave a toddle chocolate. SO MUCH ATTITUDE.  So I angrily asked him why he had to be so rude about it. "I understand that we look very young but I don't know why you had to make him feel uncomfortable. I get carded often, but I've never had anyone be so rude. You were very belittling." And then he replies, "Seriously? You think I was being rude? That's totally not true. I'm sorry you THINK I'm being rude."  And then he proceeded to argue with me on whether or not he was being a polite person. I was a server for four years on mill avenue, and I have never, ever treated anyone that way while carding them. And the thing is, if some one IS of age, you do not want to piss them off because, DUH, they're buying your product. They're giving you money. So why have attitude? The manager never actually apologized or offered to remedy the situation at all. He just judged us as teenage hoodrats instead of young working professionals that we are. So we left.   Go ahead and give this place a try, but make sure you look rich, dress well and have 15 forms of ID available. You don't want to be judged.  Oh and stay away from the short, stubby manager in glasses with a smug grin-- he'll make your skin crawl.

I just love me a good patio, and C.A.S.A is ALL patio. BAM! The upstairs and downstairs patio have comfortable, raised seating (perfect for people watching) all wrapped around the bar. The design reminded me a lot of downtown San Diego.   We were there on a Saturday, so margaritas, mojitos and some other mixed drinks were only $4. The margaritas were bomb. I had three (whoops). They also had a special for $20 bottles of wines.   Other specials that I can remember (there's more):  Monday: Movie night Tuesday: $2 Tacos Sunday: brunch   The food and wine selections are both Spanish themed. Although the menu isn't large, it's got some great options. Bowls, burritos, salads and sandwiches--a lot of carne asada. There were both healthy options and decadent ones.   So here's what really did it for me: They have vegan options. And I'm not talking a mediocre salad or a sandwich consisting of cucumbers and sprouts. They offer a vegan carne asada burrito, vegan sandwich and a veggie bowl that can be made vegan.  The vegan carne asada burrito was effing amazing. I woke up this morning thinking about it. I'm craving it. Constantly. It's that good. It had thick pieces of juicy  "carne asada" seitan, zucchini, some other yummy vegetables, and a delicious sauce. It was so good my boyfriend didn't even put hot sauce on it (they have red and green). That's really saying something.   We spoke with the owner and he says they will always have vegan options for every meal of the day -- even brunch. He was really nice, seemed to love his chef and was walking around checking on every table.   To be clear, this isn't a vegan restaurant. They're just intelligent enough to realize there's other diets out there than the standard American omnivore. The vibe is great, the non-vegan food looked great, too. Everyone seemed happy.   Now I can get a patio, vegan food, booze and even vegan brunch at the same place?!?! Eff yes. That's worth a five-star review.
