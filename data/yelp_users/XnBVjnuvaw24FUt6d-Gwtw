So here is my honest review on America's Best in Mesa. I made an appointment today for a 5pm appointment at this location. I take a seat in their waiting room and I sit quitely watching all of the people around me coughing and blowing their nose most likely due to the flu. ( I already had the flu this year so I'm probably at no risk :)   So I get called in at 5:15pm, and I am walked into a testing room by one of their technicians named "Sandy". She asks me a few questions (What are you here for, how long have you worn contacts for, how often do you change your lenses, etc) When she asks how long I normally wear my lenses for, I truthfully tell her "Normally 2-4 weeks", She scolds me and says "IF they are two week lenses you need to throw them out after two weeks or the Optometrist will not write you a prescription!"  I agree with her just so I can continue on with the process knowing fully that I will continue to wear my 2 week lenses for a month to save money. She then tries to sell me an additional test that will cost $15. I decline, and she says "Well I hope the Dr is ok with this and still writes you a prescription because he really needs these tests..."   After a few of the other eye tests that do not cost any additional fees, I finally get moved to another waiting room, which is the final one before the Dr ( I feel like Super Mario waiting to meet Bowser in the castle at this point, but still in good spirits). Then Dr Thomas Cheney calls me into his office and does a full exam on my eyes. He asks how long I've worn lenses and I told him about 10 years, and I really like the brand so I would like to stay with them (Acuvue Oasys with Hydraclear Plus--Best lenses ever!) So he says "Well I want you to try these on, these are America's Best favorite lenses, very breathable." So I say "Sure, but honestly I am planning on taking the prescription and ordering my trusted brand online like I've done for 10 years." He says, well I can't write you a prescription for that because we don't have any here to test you in but we can special order them in." But in the meantime wear these, and maybe you will like them and want to buy them from us, we do have very competitive pricing" I said "No I want a prescription for what brand I've had for 10 years, and I am ordering online." He declined and said I'd have to come back to do the next fitting once they right lenses come in.  I then go to the front counter and tell them about my experience and that I am upset because I now have to come back for another fitting for the same lenses I've worn for 10 years. The nice girls at the counter tell me they will look to see if they have them in stock even after the Dr said they had to be ordered. They MIRACULOUSLY find a pair and I say "Great, now he can see me and write the prescription", and I am quickly shut down with the old "Well we're closing soon so it will have to be another day" So basically I spent 2.5 hours at this place to get a prescription for a brand I do not like, and the Dr marks the prescription "Dispense as Written", so I can only get that brand until he writes for a new prescription after a second fitting.  Bottom line, the PRESCRIPTION IS KEY here, they will dangle it over your head and try to convince you to buy the $15 test, and buy THEIR BRAND of lenses from them. They want to sell you contact lenses, and they seem to do whatever it takes to get you into the brand of lenses they want to sell you as well. My suggestion, stand your ground, and do not pay for anything until you get the prescription that works best for you.

I cant say enough good things about Laser for Less. I did my research before coming in and no other place could compete with their pricing. Being a guy going into a place like this I was afraid I would feel embarrassed but that was not the case at all. Their staff is very professional and friendly and the place was immaculate inside. Most importantly, the treatments worked and my hair is gone. I will most definitely recommend Laser for Less to my friends and family!

Love this place! When I first moved here, I went to Shooters World for my very first shooting experience with my Dad. Neither of us had ever shot handguns so we were both a bit nervous and unsure of what to expect.  The guys at the range counter are awesome, they gave us a good idea of what guns to start with and showed us how to operate them. At no point did they come off judgmental or anything, they were there purely just to help out and make sure we had a good experience.  Ammunition was reasonably priced, basically what you would pay when you go to Wal-Mart. They had targets, ear muffs, glasses, everything one would need for a day of shooting, all available right there. The range was clean and seemed to have enough lanes to accommodate everyone.  Additionally we ended up buying handguns from them at another visit. Their employees are all no pressure, not pushy or anything. They had a pretty decent selection of guns including tactical, hunting, and pistols of all types. They helped us make a good informed decision, and even let us take a rental of the same gun and shoot it at no charge so we could make sure it was the right gun for us.  Bottom line, if you are new to shooting and are not sure how to go about it, or if you are a seasoned veteran and you want a good range to go to, this is the right place to be.

The Good: The pizza was incredible. I'm from NY and I take my pizza very seriously. The NY hand tossed pizza crust was nice and doughy, I loved it.  The wings were really good too, but the ranch was extremely watery    The Bad: The inside of this place looks like it hasn't been remodeled in 20 years, and there really is no theme to this place. I get that it's a sports bar but it just feels dirty and uninspiring inside. You walk in and there are these thin awkward tables scattered everywhere for you to sit.  The Ugly: the waitresses were the worst I've encountered in AZ. Throughout the 2 hours of being there, they never spoke once, even while taking our order, didn't smile, nothing. None of the employees wanted to be there.   Look this is Phoenix, there are thousands of great places to eat and drink on a Friday. The pizza is good and I'd definitely order for take out in the future, but I can't spend another second of my life inside this place.

These guys are thieves! Cover charge was $5 per person which was fine, I didn't have cash but he said they can take a credit card payment. They took my card and didn't give it back. We ordered drinks as a group, and the bill came at the end of the night and all the drinks were on one bill. Again no worries since it was my friends birthday and I was happy to pay for him and his wife. I ask a server for the signature page and she says "Uhh well did you give them a card?" I said yes, and she said ok your server will be over in a minute. Then my server comes over and I ask for the signature page for the card and she's puzzled and says Well umm did you give them a card?" I said yes. She's stands there confused and I said " They took my card and never gave it back. She became extremely aggressive at this point and laughed at me and said she would go find the card. After several minutes of uncomfortable confusion she comes back with the bill and tossed it on the table. I left her $0.00 tip and left. Never again will I go to this place. $52.00 for 3 watered down drinks. There are plenty of great places to eat and drink in Arizona, this unfortunately is not one of them.

Had a great experience here. Bought a Citizen watch and paid considerably less than any of the other jewelry stores in Scottsdale Fashion Square. I was helped by Barbara and Kristin who were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful, and made sure I got exactly what I wanted. Will definitely be returning for future purchases, and will be telling family and friends about my positive experience. Thanks again!

I had an eye exam for contact lenses here today and had an incredible experience. It cost me $84 for both the glasses and contact lens prescription, cheaper than any other place I found in the valley. Also, my Optometrist, Dr. Waters was fantastic! She was very friendly and thoroughly explained the health of my eyes and didn't make me feel rushed. Next, I walked over a few steps to the optical counter to buy contact lenses, and bought a 6 month supply of my contacts for $99, way cheaper than I've ever found in my 10 years of wearing. Lisa, the woman helping me, was very sweet and helpful as well. I was extremely satisfied with my entire visit.

Had a home inspection performed by Bruce this afternoon, and I am extremely pleased with his work. His attention to detail was incredible, and he took the time to go over each item he found in detail with us. My family has used him twice now, and he is our "go to" guy! Thanks again for a great experience Bruce!

I am thoroughly impressed with this office From the very beginning the receptionist was very helpful and answered all of my questions that I had about payment. The girl taking my vitals was equally as pleasant.   Dr Rush was incredible. He took his time trying to diagnose my issue and spent a lot of time with me to help me figure out how to get better. He was understanding when I told him I had no insurance and he helped to keep costs down on RXs too.   Overall, everyone was very kind and helpful, and I paid a bit less than I had anticipated. I would most certainly recommend these guys to my friends and family.

This place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. They have a great wait staff, great food, and great drinks. You cant go wrong here. My favorite are the Tinga Chicken Tacos, and I like to wash it down with a Cadillac Margarita! If I'm with my girlfriend, we like to share the "Gigante" with is a 56 ounce margarita for $20! I take all my friends here who come to visit!

I only stopped by here for a couple drinks with friends, but was impressed with their beers on draught. They had a selection of beer from Arizona breweries that ibhandt tried anywhere else. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was relaxed and inviting, which isn't always easy to find in Phoenix. Prices were reasonable as well. The only thing that was bothersome was that you have no option but to valet your car, you can't park on your own. Otherwise great experience, and I would go back.

This is the only place I'll go to get my hair cut. I've been all over Phoenix looking for a good barber, and Boris and his team are the best in the valley by far. He always remembers me and more importantly remembers what type of cut I like. I always get in quickly when I call for an appointment too. Give these guys a try, you will not be disappointed.

This place was awesome! My fiancée and I went here last weekend and had two of the best burgers we've ever had in AZ. I had the Paris Texas Burger, and I asked for ketchup so I could squeeze it all over my burger like I always do, but then I took one bite of the burger and realized this was definitely not a burger in need of any condiments, it was perfect as is! We also had their home made chips and dipped them in their jalapeño sauce. Also, their outdoor patio setup was very spacious and inviting. We have our wedding coming up in October and will definitely be sending our friends and family here!

Had a great experience here last night with my friends. Their happy hour is a smoking deal, and I had a full pound of king crab for I think $24. It was delicious too, very fresh. My friends had oysters and sushi rolls and everything was good and fresh. The waitresses were all very sweet and attentive too. We will definitely being back very soon as this is our new "go to" spot!
