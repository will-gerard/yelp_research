Great wash and attention to detail - took about an hour to get the car back, but it was very clean afterwards. They didn't vacuum the trunk or in between the seats and center console, but I didn't ask, not sure what protocol is on that, hence the 4 stars. But I would go back.

This was the strangest trip to any restaurant I've ever had. We walk in to no one at the counter, the manager comes out and ignores us, then turns to the kid sweeping up and asks him to seat us. The kid is definitely odd and a bit rude, i.e. I say "just the two of us please"and he responds with "oh really? I see six of you" no laugh, smile, or words follow, just turns around and waves for us to follow him. We sit at the table and no one comes to us for at least 15 minutes, no silverware, water, coffee. Then the party starts. Our waiter comes up and is the strangest person I've ever met, going off on crazy tangents and honestly just making our experience uncomfortable, these are things I have no problem tolerating, if the service is good. From here we order coffee and our entrees (since we've had more than enough time to decide by now and we already want to leave). He brings us coffee and I hear him turn to a waitress and tell her he brought us decaf since there wasn't any coffee ready. I ask him if it's decaf and he tells me no, like, dude I just heard you... Anyway we start eating, no coffee or water refills until we're halfway through our meal. He brings the coffee out and with no warning from him I take a sip and the coffee is 1 degree shy of its boiling point, I'm still recovering today. Not to mention he forget to put in 1/3 of our order and we didn't receive some dishes. At the end of the meal we discuss the tip, agreeing that we'd not tip our usual 20% as this was just not a good experience, the server brings our receipt and asks us to total it out with the tip before he runs the card! So now he has to see the tip and deal with us afterwards, forcing us to tip him out 20% so we can avoid that awkward situation. One of the weirdest, most uncomfortable trips to Denny's ever,  I will not return to this location.

Stopped in after shopping at Fresh & Easy as I've been looking for a local business to buy food for my new puppy from. Omer was super helpful and honest in telling me which foods to buy that would be helpful and nutritional for my dogs growth. Signed up for their membership program which offers free bags of food after so many purchases. Great place!

I have been touring complexes from 44th St to Central Ave in the Camelback Corridor for almost a month now and I happened by Level at Sixteenth after seeing a handful of other communities in the area. After one tour with Amy we've reserved our new apartment here. She was so helpful and just a great host at the end of the day. Amy was very knowledgeable and you can tell she enjoys her job. She was very straightforward with me each time I had a question about the complex, fees, etc. She had me sold after touring our, soon to be, unit, but I had to bring my girlfriend back the next day so she could make the decision as well. Amy had us put a hold down on the unit, we came back the next day and that was that! She worked with me to fit and find the perfect apartment for our budget and we are counting down the days to move in!

I stopped in for a new coil, but they didn't carry my Ego1 in the store. Chase (maybe Chris? can't remember his name) the manager was on duty, he invited me to hang out and try some flavors, and I did. Great looking store, they have some of the nicest flavors I've seen, albeit expensive. The friendliness of the manager and atmosphere in the store was better than most shops I've been too, nice work guys!
