Busy Friday night sat within 20 minutes. Our server Michael was fantastic. Very prompt and attentive. Salad was super fresh. Caesar salad dressing was good. Pizzas came hot out of the oven. We will definitely be back soon. Love the remodel as well.

We had a party of at least 35 for a birthday on Saturday 6:30 pm busiest time in a restaurant. Josh our serve was so wonderful. He was very prompt, none of our food was messed up. Not once was our soda glass more then half empty at anytime. Serving is not easy and this kid did an amazing job. Kudos to Josh. Thanks for a great expirence!

1st time eating here and I will be honest don't think I'll ever be back. The server Stephanie made me feel very rushed. Their menu is huge so I wanted to see what they all had. She was very short with us and was not polite at all. When we were taken to our table the gentlemen acted as If he didn't want to seat us because our other half of our party (2 people) were outside because there was no place to sit or stand while waiting inside. Thumbs down to this place on their customer service.

PLEASE STAY AWAY! VERY MISLEADING AND THEY LIE LIE LIE. Son hurt his arm playing football not an emergency where he needs to be seen immediately but after all is said and done come to find out they are not contracted with blue cross blue shield. Why could they not tell us this when we arrived???? We handed them the insurance card right away. Trust me they pizsed off the wrong woman.

This clinic is top notch. Everything you need they have. Boarding, grooming and vet care. My dogs have been there for everything and I am more then pleased. Best customer service and clean place. My dogs are staying in a clean, healthy environment. I've read on parasite control and I see why they screen all dogs entering. To keep our dogs healthy and prevent the spread of common parasites and I love that.    Some of these reviews are untrue. They are not near a canal you must be thinking of the other kennel place that's all out doors down the way from Ocotillo. Besides I know when dogs see other dogs they bark they are dogs duh! Keep up the amazing work Ocotillo I wouldn't go anywhere else.

I have always used fletchers same with my family members but after this visit I will never return. Bought a groupon and after I got there I was told I needed $384 more of stuff done. I told them to hold off on work as when needing anything major or costly I like to get a second opinion. Well I went to get a second opinion and was told that fletchers is smoking crack that what I was told needed to be done was not the case at all. I honestly feel they are using groupon to get you in the door so you think your getting a smoking deal but then tell you that you need this and that to make the money they are losing thru groupon. I am very disappointed.

Such a great experience I had yesterday working with Corey. Very knowledgeable and fast service. Answered all my questions and showed me how to do everything with my iPhone as I have only used android. I will drive from Mesa to this store just to get top notch service!

Leah did the the best job ever on the bride. That was the only 5 star there! The other wedding party was disappointed with their hair. Nats flying around in there because of the orange juice for mimosas. Yuck hope I don't have bugs in my drink. There are some girls there that think their sh*t don't stink. She treated her Co workers like sh*t, very rude and was dressed very tacky for that establishment. Her weave alone made me request not to have her touch my hair. How can you be a stylist and walk out the door looking like that.

Show up with a party of 15. Called 2 weeks prior and made the reservation so they would not be bombarded with a huge party. Waited 20 minutes for and ice tea while my entire party received their alcoholic beverages. Specifically asked the server if there was celery already mixed in the salad. Was advised no it was not and asked for no celery or blue cheese crumbles. Well guess what it had celery mixed in with it. I will not be returning. It was such chaos.

Right now they only get 2 stars. We will see if they improve. 1st and 2nd visit was good. Had issue will billing was sent to collections was told they made a mistake and I requested a letter showing a zero balance as they said they took care of everything. Still received collection letter after calling the office they contacted the collection agency to have it resolved. 3rd visit not so good. Routine cleaning and x-rays we were there 3 hours. Called to schedule my son for 2 fillings. When calling the lady said he needed a baby crown. Advised them that was never mentioned. She said oh that was an old treatment plan that was not taken off. Schedule for 10 am on a Wednesday. Tuesday receive 2 phone calls 20 minutes apart to confirm my appointment. Appointment confirmed then 4:3pm receive a message they need to move my appt to 7am. Try to call back and their phone turn over to an answering service at 4pm so why ask me to call back? So do I show up at 7am and hope I have an appt or show up at 10 am and hope I have an appt or worry if I get charged a no show fee. Finally the regional manager called me at 9pm and I agreed to 7am. The kicker that now has me looking for a new dentist is they tell they are doing a crown when they said that was an old plan. So dentist had to do another mouth evaluation and that was what needed to be done. I'm ok with it but I need to know what my child is in for such as pain etc so I am prepared and discuss with him what to expect. They waived the anesthesia charge and the crown charge for all of the issues and miscommunication. I have no issues paying for services rendered but would like to be prepared. When I was just planning to do 2 fillings with nothing out of pocket then that's what I am expecting. This is how I got sent to collections before. Told I had no payments as my insurance covers this stuff as routine yet I received a bill. Hopefully Becky the regional manager can fix this place. She seems to be the only one with customer service skills and a head on her shoulder. Watch out to little do they know I am bilingual and understand the shit talking they do in Spanish and when I said excuse me what was that she said oh nothing. Yep sure nothing. Sure you won't see my business again!!!!

Excellent food and atmosphere. Not a kid friendly place but great for group of friends. The fries are amazing so was the burger. The cucumber water was great I've never had it before and am craving it all the time now.

This place is horrific. Customer service is horrible. The only plus since weve dined there a couple times was a very nice young blonde girl was so friendly and was a asset to this company and i have not seen here recently but I will no longer spend another penny in this place. This owner is absolutely in the clouds with what is going on in their facility.

This place was very good. Fast service, fresh ingredients. Staff was awesome. Place could have been a little more clean but it was very busy and it was father's day. I will definitely be back here again.

I see everyone before me gave them 5 stars and I definitely see in the future I could give 5 stars. Today had a fill and decided to do a pedicure. The gentleman asked me if I had gel on my nails. I told him yes I do and on my toes too. Once it was time for my pedicure he asked why I didn't tell him I had gel. Um hello I did. He told me I had to let them soak for 10 minutes. I sat there for 30 mins waiting. The 10 min massage I paid for was only 6 minutes I actually timed it. Oh well I don't mind a little wait but what really disappointed me is when the lady came to scrap the softened gel off my nails she grabbed a tool that was just used on the lady next to me. I am not a big complainer but this is a cause for concern. My nails do look great and the pricing is comparable to other salons. I was with my previous person for 5 years and she decided to pursue doing hair so I am a very loyal customer.

Portions are huge. Food not so good. I think the red sauce came from a can. Chairs could use an update. Its to open so private conversations are not private. The girl across the room told are table about her whole relationship with a guy she had a one night stand with. Definitely annoying as we are trying to have a family meal. Don't think we will be back.

Absolutely in love with their food. Meat so tender. Tortillas are fresh. I am happy happy happy. We will definitely be back again I promise that. You have won me over Chipotle anyday. About a 4 mile drive but well worth it.

10 minute wait to be seated and this place was dead. Seated near bar and waited 20 minutes and not 1 person acknowledged us. No hello be with you in one minute. This place had no ac on I swear. It was hot as hell inside. Moved to the outside and we waited an hour for our food but remember this place is dead. Server said kitchen is extremely behind. I walked out f*** waiting for this shit. I've been a server. I know the difference between busy and lazy.

Dj Myth knows his stuff. Always the best music and has an amazing photo booth. Not only does he do events but he is a dj at local valley spots. I go places just to listen to him spin as he has the best of all the music hands down. You won't be disappointed going with Drop Top Entertainment!

First visit ever to a popeyes in my 33 years of life. Pulled into drive thru which they have 2 ordering stations. Asked if they could give me just a minute to look over the menu then a guy comes on the intercom and asks if we are almost ready like he is in some type of rush. Not to ask if we had any questions or needed help. Absolutely horrible customer service. I backed right out if drive thru and went else where for dinner. To think these little kids want $15 an hour ha yeah right.

Seriously so disappointed in this place. Twice now I walk in and there is no line and people look at you but don't say anything to you. Both times I've ordered the same items to go. A turkey bacon avecado salad. First time the forget my dressing. Second time they don't put avecado and I find a long dark hair in my salad. You have lost my business and I will not recommended this place. Customer service is key and the definitely lack it.
