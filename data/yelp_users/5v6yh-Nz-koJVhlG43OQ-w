Hot Bagels some of the best bagels I have ever had. They have speedy service. I go there at least once a week for breakfast, and its affordable to do that (and I work for minimum wage). Their breakfast menu is delicious, but their lunch menu is also great. I think people forget about their lunch food, but its still just as great. I recommend it for everyone.

I was severely disappointed with my trip to Sakana. I remember coming to this restaurant and it being good quality, however I this trip changed my opinion. While I will say that the wait-staff was nice and the atmosphere was ok, the food quality was below average. I had a selection of nigiri and most of the pieces were dry and had a "fishy" taste to them. Both attributes that I associate with low quality fish. I was disappointed with my visit.

This restaurant is the best fish and chips in the west valley. There is a vast variety of fish to be eaten. I highly recommend it.

The drinks here are really good. The drink menu is very diverse and the bartenders are always willing to help choose a drink or make something that will be good for you. But none of the bartenders are hot.

I wish I could recommend Desoto, but it's hard to when it seems like they decide to close early every night. Only focusing on the bar and the burger place, the food is OK but the drinks are good. I wish I had the chance to actually have them, though. I don't recommend going to Desoto at night, but if you do, you better have a second place in mind.
