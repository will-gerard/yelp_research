After trying several BBQ places in the Cave Creek area, this is our new go-to spot! Nice atmosphere indoors and outdoors. We really enjoyed sitting outside on nice evening. I got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw (yummy!) and my boyfriend got the two meat combo 1/2lb of beef brisket and pulled pork with baked potato salad and the brisket chili. Both meats were delicious and I loved the potato salad the best and he loved the chili. The service was fast too.  You won't be disappointed!

The service was poor and disappointing. Our server was disinterested in providing attention to our table and was rude. The sushi quality was probably 2 1/2 to 3 stars. I haven't been to this place in over a year and it has definitely gone downhill. I would not recommend it unless you keep your expectations low, go at happy hour or sit at the bar.

Really good and caring staff and service by Z herself. Food was delicious and flavorful. We also arrived in time for happy hour priced appetizers. I'll definitely be back.

Josie is the best server!!! First time here with a group of 5. She provided the best service, so helpful and personable. Hush puppies and char oysters were great app choices. We ordered shrimp, lobster, mussels and crawfish with corn and potatoes. Yummy! I liked the shrimp, lobster and mussels the best with the traditional boil. We'll be back!

My experience was fantastic. This is my 3rd time doing CPR/AED and first Aid. Matty did a thorough job teaching the techniques. I would definitely recommend this company and Matty (Lingfei) to any individuals or company.
