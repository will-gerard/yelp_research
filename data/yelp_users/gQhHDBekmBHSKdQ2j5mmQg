Nice zoo. It was overcast and rainy so it was perfect weather for this zoo, it would have been way to hot otherwise.

This place is a hole in the wall they have great pizza and salads. It was a small place but I would still say it was kid friendly.

The positive things about this place would definitely be the beds they were very comfortable. But they put throw pillows on the perfectly clean bed which is really nasty they look like they have never been cleaned and the first thing I do is knock them on the floor like everybody else. The negative would be about everything else; we had a room with two double beds and the room was just to small for two beds, my husband and I kept hitting our shins on the corner of the beds. The bathrooms were in pretty bad shape. I say bathrooms because we had plumbing issues and had to move rooms, so both bathrooms were old and in need of repair.

Every time we visit Arizona we always go to Tom's. There Italian Beef is fantastic with peppers and grilled onions, makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We also had there Vienna hotdogs there great as well.

We went to Flickas after a baseball game the owner was very friendly and he gave us a great deal on lunch for about twenty guys. Which included beer and shots as well. It's not kid friendly but during the day it was okay because we had the place to ourselves. The food was good for the price and the great personalized service it can't be beat.

Our first visit was a five: We came across this place by accident but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. My husband had the silver city sub which is an Italian style sub, which he said was one of the best he has ever had. I had there home stake which was really good as well.  Our last visit would be !/2 a star: Service was very slow and the sandwiches were not very good at all we should have gone to Jimmy Johns down the street. We wont be going back!

This place is over priced and the sandwiches are not that great. I paid extra for avocado and seriously got one sliver on each side of my sandwich, total rip off. Don't waste your time subways better than this place.

We have stayed in four hotels this trip and I have to say this is the nicest out if all of them!  The room is clean, modern and very comfortable! They offer a nice breakfast, it had a good selection and there were three different ladies cleaning and restocking.   We used the pool and it was clean and well maintained and the pool towels were very soft!   I also used the gym in the morning, I love having that available its always the best way to start the day.!  I was very pleased I'm not sure why they get such a low star rating.

If I described this place in a few words it would be rundown and dirty. Oh and urine! How could I forget that one. On the golf course you will get nice whiffs of urine smell!

I thought this Denny's deserves a five star! There was only one hostess and one waiter and they were hustling and I think they did a good job! The food is always decent.

I have only been to Dave and Busters once when they first opened there location in Orange County but I remember it was clean and kid free.  So when we went in to the Dave and Busters in the Tempe Marketplace I was really surprised to see kids running around everywhere! I don't think that after 5pm kids should be allowed in to Dave & Busters because for one thing there not being properly supervised by their parents and some pervert could run off with one of them! I also feel kids shouldn't be hanging out with a bunch of drunken adults, it's totally inappropriate!

Extremely disappointed, this hotel is going down hill! It's smelly, dirty and some things look in serious disrepair.   The first room we were booked in, we walked in and walked right back out. The overwhelming smell of mold was very strong. So we switched rooms but this room smells as well, smells like wet dog or ass and that's not good!   The room is dirty stains on the carpet, the area around the shower was moldy and rusting the shower doors, and the couch smelled terrible again that pet/ass smell and it just didn't look like a place you wannabe cozy up! There is nothing that will make me feel more uncomfortable and home sick then the lack of cleanliness.   Things in disrepair- the baseboard under the sink is falling off, the air conditioner vibrates and is noisy, the bathroom light takes a few seconds to turn on either the lightbulb is going out or there's some other kind of shortage, there's chipped paint on all the doors and the furniture such as the desk chair looks like something's out wouldn't bring home from the Goodwill!   I love the Hyatt brand, and I hope this hotel can get there shit together.

There is not to much to do in Arizona. So we went for a scenic drive and it was pretty. The roads can be kind of scary.

I'm not a huge ice cream fan but I really like Gelato. It's lite, flavorful and half the fat of regular ice cream. I highly recommend the coconut so good!

Nice stadium, they keep it nice and cool on those hot summer days in Arizona! They do a really nice firework display on Friday nights!  The Qoors Light lounge is awesome they do happy hour tell 6:30, it's a great place to watch the game from they have TV's, a pool table and the line for drinks isn't to bad.  I also recommend the Sonora Hot Dog it's amazing!  My only compliant is you can't hear the announcer very well at all and the music they play pre-game during batting practice should be way louder too!

Great salads and pizza!   We went Saturday mostly families and it was not to busy they have a good salad selection and we felt the pizza was reasonable priced.  We had never had thin crust pizza before, it was good the toppings were all at the center which I didn't like that but the crust was good.

This laundry mat is nasty, dirty and smelled like urine. I also don't recommend women going there alone at night or during the day there are some seriously shading characters that hang out in and around the laundry mat.

I like the build your own burger concept but it just wasn't executed very well. My chicken was dry, the bread was burned and I also got the lemonade and they couldn't do refills (I hate that)!

We tried the brisket, pork ribs, sausage, grits, beans and coleslaw. Everything was amazing! The meat is beyond moist and the sides were all so yummy! They also are the nicest people that work there they make you feel very welcome!  Everything is spot on!

Texas style BBQ!  I have been to Rudys in Colorado Springs and was so excited to see one in Arizona!   I'm a big ban of the brisket, baby back ribs, smoked potato with meat, creamed corn and all of the deserts are amazing!

My husband really likes this place me on the other hand not so much. I always get a salad which obviously is the wrong thing. The salads are not good and the dressings are not good either. So if you go there don't bother getting a salad!
