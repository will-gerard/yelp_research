I want to talk about the Pizza at Niccoli's! A few decades ago my best friend and I discovered this place. Note: we both come from Italian family's who were raised on good ingredients that only a deli can have. This is not your hut kind of pizza. Then we went back and poof it was gone! Skip forward a couple of decades, and we were still talking about this pizza and how good it really is, when our friend said, "Oh yeah, I know where they are now." We got over there had the pizza and BAM there was the best Pizza we ever had in Phoenix! If you are looking for an authentic NYC pizza made with ingredients only Italians use, Niccoli's is the place.

There are certain neighborhood staples that exist in any area. Baker's is that kind of place. I have been going to their nursery for more than a decade. When I drive by, they do a good job reminding me to "FEED CITRUS NOW". I need that kind of thunk on my head. We also went to them to make our wedding gift take aways. We asked our guests to plant a tree to mark our special occasion and to help us make roots. Our guests have told us how those tiny little trees have really grown in a decade. Bakers had surprised us by nicely wrapping them up. From then on I was a believer. There are bigger, national sources but you cannot beat a sweet little place in your area, who knows your plants and the needs we have unique to Phoenix. Go take a stroll around, you'll find everything you need.

Sometimes when you are looking for a job, you feel like you are all alone out there. With Axis, I had the best experience of being well prepared for my interview. They gave me feedback I needed. Did an excellent job quickly and efficiently notifying me of updates with the potential client, etc. And the quality of the client was more than I could have hoped for. I would definitely recommend them if you are out there in a sea of many applicants and you want to be well represented and informed before going into an interview.

My family has met on several occasions at this cafe. It is part of the Grayhawk Golf Club. It is not super busy, which we prefer. What we like is there is always this big table with a gorgeous view of the golf course and Pinnacle Peak Mtn. Our waiter was a nice young man with a good sense of humor, which is needed with our sarcasm. The menu is typical light standard American sandwiches and wraps and salads (lunch). I had the turkey wrap which was okay. We all had desserts which we all remarked were more choices than we usually get at a more formal dining experience. Definitely have the melted cchip cookie with a scoop of vanilla--I would drive there just to have that again! The staff was very courteous too. The prices were reasonable. The bathrooms are also for the golfers so there are some amenities like hairspray, etc. if you need it. I think this place is a great secret in the chaos of Scottsdale. I even like the entry way area while waiting to meet the group. Photo Op: When you get done, venture out to the patio--if you aren't seated there already and walk around the lake they have there. The kids loved seeing the ducks and catfish in the lake which come right up to you. And the golfers on a cart driving by stopped their cart, and took a picture with our cameras of the whole family--now that is friendly! Beautiful desert backdrop for locals or visitors.

I thought I would add an element that the other reviews didn't mention. I go to this library with my kids. The reason the kids jump in the car is that the kids section is just so cool looking. The small kiddie area has this giant cat paw which is a bench to sit on. The rest of the kids section is a castle theme, complete with a draw bridge and tower to read in. They need to put more light to be able to really read, though. It's colorful and bright, not like any library I had available when I was a kid. It makes you want to read and hang out there! If they made all the schools this cool looking no one would ever leave! :)  I am enclosing some photos because if you are visiting or you just have to find a way to kill some time with kids on a budget, this library is great. The kids find the books pretty easily. There is a teen section but I did peek in and it looked pretty hip. I really love that the adult section it is done in a mission style, probably to nod to Frank Lloyd Wright's presence in the Valley. It looks old and traditional and that is rare in a new city like Phoenix.  Other details: The parking is covered--a must in AZ. There are always nooks to hang out by yourself. The staff is very helpful. The check out is pretty easy with bar coding. They also have a good baby program for the really young kids. Great place to rent DVD's and save some money. Oh and the drive thru book drop off is helpful. While you are at it, donate your books and mags to recycle in the drive thru.   And then go run around outside on the Mall area. I don't mean stores Mall, just a big sidewalk area with no cars. Snap a photo at the LOVE sculpture too. All good fun and a smart way to pass the day.

I just had to review my rooftop yoga class this past weekend at Sutra. I have taken only a couple of classes, but I am hooked. This time I took the class they offer on the rooftop of The Clarendon Hotel (3rd Ave & Clarendon-just S.of Ind Sch. at Central Ave).   The class was led by Meagan. She made an effort to learn our names, which was a nice touch. You might want to wear some tight fitting sunglasses, since you are outside on the roof, but it was early and since it's cooling off in the AM now, it was great. I measure the quality of the practice by how many of my muscles ached the next day--they all did, so they definitely did a great job covering all areas. I'm a little out of shape, so you might not have this issue. But the atmosphere could not be beat.   We had a 360 view of every mountain range and the whole urban vibe of being atop a hotel among the downtown cityscape. It was a memorable class and well worth attending. A nice meet up for friends. Oh and I spoke to the owner the night before, Mike or Michael?He was great and was patient with my questions. What is not to like. Please note: I am pretty picky about my yoga and have been doing the practice for 11 yrs. and SuTRA meets all my needs. And (in studio, another time) they did play Reggae--love it! Check it out for yourself. And now I am going back for drinks at the Clarendon rooftop sometime. Two cool things mixed together, can't beat it! The only thing better would have been having a drink while doing Yoga! :)

I met friends for dinner at Arcadia Tavern this week. The have complimentary Valet because their lot is probably too small. That location is a little awkward. The brunette hostess at the door was the best thing, she was friendly and greeted us and knew which group I was looking for--she gets 5 stars!   I was a little surprised at the pricing in the menu, but assumed that for that price, my meal should rock. I got the 48th St. Salad with the walnuts, cranberries, applies, blue cheese, etc. I get some variation of that salad lots of places, so I am a pretty good judge of it. It had something that was cinnamon in it, which kind of overwhelmed the taste and didn't quite belong. Someone next to me got something else and said theirs had cinnamon too. They didn't  like it either. I love cinnamon, but not on certain things. I did try the onion rings which were okay.   It looks like a cute place with jersey's hanging high on the ceiling--good atmosphere for a beer. Lots of neighbors were there. Work on the food a little more or lower the price, so I lower my expectations. A nice choice of draft beers too. No one at my table raved about their food. If you want to be a player in the Arcadia Foodie district, you gotta make your menu rock.

It's a really good feeling when you get work done on your home that finally solves the problems you've been having! Mike, the owner of Paar Plumbing, is so great, I had to review his company. I was referred to him by my Dad's friend. I had many plumbers over the years come in and sorta fix the problems (we have on our 1950's home).   Mike was the first one who SOLVED the problems. It was messy, it was not super cheap, but it was done CORRECTLY. He even hooked up the Ikea sink which turned out to be a huge hassle for my DIY project. FYI-- those Ikea sinks are Euro plumbing fitted, so you have to pay to get the hookups converted (nothing about that in the catalog)! Oh and they cleaned up things and left a great finish on things like doing the caulking right.  He was also honest about which things were long term issues and which things to not worry about.  He grew up in a plumbing family, he knows his stuff. He also told me he prefers new install stuff the most. I hate to even tell everyone, since it means he will be that much more busy, but I had to share. We even high fived at the end. Okay, that part was kinda yucky! :) Thanks Mike (and your assistant) things are so much better now.
