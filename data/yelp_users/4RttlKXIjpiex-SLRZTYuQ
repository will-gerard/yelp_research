Saturday night my two friends and I decided to give Clancy's a shot because we love a good dive bar. We walked over after having our first round of drinks of the night (about 2 each). We were not drunk-not in the slightest. Two of us have worked in the restaurant industry for ten years now, including bartending, so we are great, easy going guests who tip well if the service is even just "decent." As we were walking in, the woman behind the bar was talking to 2 other women at the bar who looked like they might be her friends.  I immediately noticed the absolutely disgusting looks that they gave us, and the obvious agitation from the bartender that she had to serve more customers. The place was less than half full, and it was around 9pm. So no, she wasn't busy, and it was not close to closing time. The second we sat down, before she even said hello, she decided that the man we were with was "too drunk." He was clearly not, and I would absolutely not be offended IF he was, I understand the liabilities as a bartender. This was not the case. My friend, confused and taken aback, asked her if she was kidding, when she said no, he asked if he could at least sit with us while we had a drink. "No, get out," was her response. It was the rudest experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  It is very obvious from the other reviews that you have a problem with your bartenders having SH!T attitudes, and customer service skills. Whoever owns this place should be embarrassed, you are letting your employees ruin your bar.

I went there this morning after my mom recommended it for the vegetarian options. I had a breakfast burrito with goat cheese and cucumbers in it, AMAZING! The place has a cool atmosphere and the service was great. The owner bought my mom and I mimosas. Can't wait to go back!
