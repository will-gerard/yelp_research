If you're expecting customer service, I don't recommend this Subway at all. After standing (with no line mind you) for 5 minutes waiting for someone to take my order, a guy finally asked the two girls who were chatting in a corner if she was going to help me, she sighed very loudly and threw a fit before making her way to help me. After asking how her day was three times, I realized then that she was ignoring me on purpose. I've had similar bad experiences with them like this before, different people each time.

They were on time, positive attitudes, and AC has been working great ever since they came out to fix it! Really well priced as well, definitely recommend!
