I love this place because it's so close to my house but the service is HORRIBLE! We are here on St. Paddys day, it's not busy and we wait 10 minutes for beer. Not to mention, the waitress seems clueless.

Love this place! Their chicken pesto pizza is amazing. There's nothing on the menu you won't like!
