My friends and I have been coming to this bar for 9 years. We decided to return there this past Saturday night for karaoke/Woodshed reunion. We were having blast and so were most of the other patrons. A girl friend of mine and myself decided to rap Dr. Dre's "Forgot About Dre". It was hilarious! However after my friend rapped a verse that contained the "N" word (NOT "er" but with "as") the bouncer approached us and said if we continued talking like this we would be thrown out. I'm white/Italian, my friend is Cuban and the bouncer was black. Not a single patron complained or seemed to have a problem. Plus we were not at all trying to be offensive. It was the lyrics to the song! It was not starred out or bleeped, IT WAS TYPED OUT ON THE TV FOR US AND EVERYONE ELSE TO READ! If it was not appropriate then it should not be on the list of song choices. Also, why is the "bouncer" inside watching karaoke? Shouldn't he be at the door checking IDs?? He made us feel like crap, like we were racists. If we were black he would have not said a word! Apparently he thinks this is the 1950's and there should be a "black and white" list of songs. That "bouncer" is the real racist. We have seen much worse situations go down at this bar and that "bouncer" just stand around and watch, but us 2 little girls are a serious threat to that bar. What a joke. Never again. That place is disgusting anyways. We will spend our money elsewhere.

The only place that is not a complete mess in Scottsdale! After being slapped in the face by Bottled Blonde and Derby Public House, my friends and I checked this place out and it was such a breath of fresh air! Reasonably priced drinks unlike what the other clubs in Scottsdale charge. I swear, I think those other place water down their booze and then charge you $10 a drink for it. Majerle's has a cool NORMAL crowd. Wasn't too packed, played great music and was a ton of fun. Definitely my favorite place in the area. Nice big bar if you want to chill and watch some sports, then BAM on the other side of the place another bar with a dance floor! Perfect!! My friends and I will be back for sure!

OK, so here's my story. I am 31 yrs old and have had Psoriasis since high school age. Anyway, I've been on a topical medication since I was diagnosed. Same medication for basically my whole life. About 2 weeks ago I called CVS for a refill on this medication, they informed me that my refills are expired (this medication is in a foam form so it lasts MONTHS++). They told me they would fax over the refill request to my doctor, Tamara Casillas. Within the next day I got a call from CVS saying they received back the approval from my doctor for the refill, however the medication is no longer covered by my insurance and would be over $400 out of pocket. WOW, thanks but no thanks. CVS then offered to send a request to the doctor for a cheaper alternative. Great! Well over a week goes by and I don't hear from CVS. I call them and they state they have not gotten a response from the doctor. I call East Valley Dermatology to see what the hold up is and end up leaving 4 voice mails and never received a call back (Don't worry I waited over a week). I call a 5th time and someone at the nurse's station finally answers. She tells me there is NO RECORD of Dr. Casillas signing off on ANY medication for me and that they NEVER received any medication requests from CVS. How is that even possible?? This nurse tells me she will look into and call me back.  I get the call back 2 days later, from this flipping dippy girl named "Jen" and she tells me that they never got anything from CVS and never approved any refills and that they would not approve any refills until I come in for another appointment. Are you KIDDING ME?? I explain to her what CVS tells me and she basically says that I'm making it up and/or that CVS is falsifying doctor signatures. She also tells me that it would be "illegal" for Dr. Casillas to write me a prescription without seeing me AGAIN first. Here's a question, isn't it "ILLEGAL" to alter/falsify/change/delete or improperly enter medical records?? And once again, Dr. Casillas DID sign off on the medication refill and CVS has the documentation proving it!   I would NOT be surprised if Tamara Casillas approved my medication but didn't log it into the system because every time I've been there she is "confused" by their computer system. So she more than likely screwed it all up but is far too unprofessional and full of herself to admit her mistake.  So Jen continues to be zero help and just argues with me, so I contact CVS who is also not happy with this office making accusations since they have it in writing and timed stamped showing that Dr. Tamara Casillas signed off on my refill on January 5th 2016. So CVS calls East Valley Dermatology and talks to different gal named Susan who also claimed there was no record and to cancel the RX that was magically approved. Oddly, no one has spoken to Dr. Casillas, not me and not CVS. So I am left to wonder if she even knows what her little minions are doing. This was an error on East Valley Dermatology's end. I have been on this medication for over 10 years and I just wanted a cheaper alternative to the medication that WAS approved, but they just wanted to make more money by having me come in for a bogus appointment and not cop to the HUGE mistake THEY made. I told East Valley Girl Jen, that just because they made an error in their records, doesn't mean it didn't happen. Her stupid @$$ responded with, "Well just because CVS says it happened doesn't mean it did." Great customer service!! I will NEVER come back here, I will gladly pay the co pay to get a follow up with my family physician to get the proper care that I need. What a stressful mess.   PS. I want to mention the fact that during one of my visit's Dr. Casillas examined a mole in my ass crack without any gloves, so to every patient after me, you're welcome and I am sorry. If I would have realized it at the time I would have stopped it, but of course I was basically face down.   Side note: I DID get mouthy with little miss Jen over the phone, but who wouldn't? This is a CROCK! They expected me to come in, pay them another $50 just for them to say, "Yup! You still have Psoriasis!!" I'm no medical professional, but I am pretty sure there is NO CURE for Psoriasis. I'm not asking Vicodin here, just a cheaper alternative to my CURRENT medication.  A basic topical treatment that I have been on since childhood. Don't they know that STRESS only causes Psoriasis flare ups? They probably don't since they can't even enter medical records properly.

Not only did me and my group have to find the waitress to even bring us menus and just some simple water...but it took 15-30 mins EACH between receiving any other drinks and food. All because our waitress was far too busy flirting with the same guy the entire time we were there. The kitchen staff even had to bring our food to us because she was M.I.A. exchanging her phone number for tips at the other table. When we paid her, she took another 20 mins with our credit cards, when we found her she was standing our with our money in her hands talking to the same dude she was busy with before! Days later I checked my bank account and the waitress had changed the tip amount that I wrote in on my slip! She literally STOLE money from me! I called to speak to a manager who was far too busy to care, and she even confirmed that the waitress wrote in a different tip amount. However, she did NOTHING about it. Told me I could dispute it with my bank or receive a credit at their bar. WHY in the WORLD would I take a CREDIT to your establishment for the money STOLEN from me???!!! Needless to say I disputed the ENTIRE charge with my bank and thankfully received my money back. WITH ZERO help from Derby Public House. Who knows how many people this waitress or others have done this to thinking they wouldn't notice?? The manager was FULLY aware and shrugged it off! Never again will I go the Derby Public House. FAR too expensive as it is, and their waitresses moonlight as THIEVES!!!

Called on a Thursday to make reservations for a group on a Saturday night. I was told I was all set and we'd have a table ready for us at 9pm that Saturday night. My girls and I show up at 9pm on the dot, and the hostess tells me that I don't have a reservation. She tells me reservations are only for people with "bottle service" and spending a minimum of $200. WTF? So WHY was I allowed to make a reservation in the first place?? The dense girl's response, "I don't know." Obviously.  This is Scottsdale Arizona people. This is not Hollywood or Vegas. Get over yourselves! I was then painfully run into by some drunk dude and a drunk girl covered in glitter and possibly a bikini. Which means they are clearly over serving their patrons. :) We were outta there!  And in response to the comment left below from I am assuming a manager, it doesn't change the fact that you do not allow customers to sit down and enjoy themselves at a table without paying your establishment a minimum of $200. That is absurd. You advertise as a comfy, calm pizzeria type place, when really you are just typical Scottsdale. Over-hyped, over-sexed, over-priced and you value yourselves much higher than you deserve. Drink quality, food quality, and obvious customer service do NOT match your prices.

My husband and I went there for lunch yesterday, (Sunday, April 19th). He had been there before and thought it was a cool little spot. We sat down at the center booth, waited about 5 mins for a server to come over and bring us menus. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a rum and coke. Another server brought us waters which was nice. (We had a total of about 4 servers) Then our drinks came, my husband got his beer, but for some reason I received a Jack Daniels and coke. Don't get me wrong, I like whiskey, but I ordered RUM. They gave me a new drink, no issues there. Someone came back around and took our food order, I was STARVING and everything on the menu sounded amazing. Now, I get that this is a small hole-in-the-wall bar. I don't discriminate on bar food. However, it took **45 MINUTES** for us to get our food. The place was relatively busy, I understand, but they were serving food to tables that ordered much later than us, like 30 mins later than us and it's a SMALL place. Needless to say, we were completely forgotten about. A guy that I am assuming was the manager even walked about with our food, but for some reason thought that it went to the table next to us. He got completely confused when he saw that they already had their food. Don't mind us! The empty table directly next to them starring at you!! He then ran back to the kitchen with our food where I am only to assume he tossed it. Because 5 minutes later he told us that he was sorry for the wait and the food would be out in 2 more mins. 2 more mins? Why? You just had it in your hands!! Well 2 mins became 10. He returned to tell us he was sorry yet again and that it would be another 5 mins. That 5 mins became 15. At this point I am officially HANGRY and about to hulk smash our table. They FINALLY bring out our food which LOOKS worth the wait. I ordered their chicken sandwich, I attempt to grab it to scarf it down when I had to stop. I am not sure where this amount of grease was coming from, but it looked to me as if the chicken was peeing itself. Literally. It drained for a solid minute. I now had grease soup on my plate. I go to take my first bite in spite and the entire thing fell apart into my grease soup. I had to ask for a second plate so that I could attempt to eat it by cutting it up without saturating it again. My husband's tacos did the same thing but basically worse. His taco grease was a much darker and disturbing brown. I was so grossed out I just gave up any hope of eating. I immediately felt sick and worried as to why this took so long and what exactly was I trying to eat. Even though I sat there with pure disgust on my face with 2 full plates of untouched slop, no one seemed to care. They just brought us our check. 4 drinks and 2 plates of slop for $50. Let the hulk smashing begin. I will never step foot in that place again, no matter how hangry and desperate I am. I've had MUCH better bar food for much less money. Even Filiburtos has treated me better.
