My boyfriend and I come here often. I love how it's small, not pretentious at all. It's so hard to find good Italian in AZ. Especially when your boyfriend is a hard core East Coast Italian! This is the only place his picky Italian family will eat at when in town. Staff is great and we always feel welcomed. The veal meatballs and wild boar cavatelli are on point...must tries!

Consistency, consistency! How could you not want to go to a place that is consistent every time you go. Great service, great ambiance, great food, great wine, and it's always great quality!

Vincent's market bistro is my usual weekday go to. Always pleased with there salads, soups, apps, mains and desserts! Scotty and the staff are the best. You know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years.

I recently dined here and did not have a good experience. I dine at steakhouses frequently, Hillstone group, capital grille etc. and this place has never been comparable. My filet had no sear, my boyfriends dad's fish was over cooked, the creamed spinach was like soup, burrata was a joke and the saut√©ed spinach was over salted. There pour on glasses of wine are quite small too, no different ounce options. For the prices, go to Capital Grille! Pretty disappointing, especially the waiter with the southern accent giving us attitude for complaining about the soupy creamed spinach and not wanting to order there chocolate lava cake, lol. Chandler is pretty disappointing with there options of restaurants. Not worth the drive.

I work for a local transportation company in town and we bring all of our sedans and SUV's to this location. The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. They always diagnose the problem quickly and get our vehicles back on the road fast. I highly recommend this location. Charlie and his team are great!

Old school joints are my fave, especially since everything in AZ is a chain. Steak was great, wine was good. Definitely will come back again!

I hate writing bad reviews but this place definitely deserves it. There was nothing enjoyable about my experience here but the company I kept. The food was horrible and the place is disgustingly filthy. Get new menus! They are embarrassing. If the cleanliness of the restaurants reflects into the kitchen, who knows what it looks like where they are cooking the food you eat. Clean the bathrooms (shit stains, used tampon on the floor)! How hard is that!   I hate to say it but I'm sure all the bad reviews on here are spot on, maybe nicer then they should be. Normally I wouldn't come to a place with such horrible reviews but I was invited. It is obvious this place is a fly by night operation, no manager in sight.  Definitely a candidate for Restaurant Impossible! Horrible! Make sure you do not order the meatloaf!   This place is a joke and unfortunately I wouldn't trust or believe one good review you read. I cannot believe this place is still open.

I work for a transportation company, and Justin from Wright A/V has installed various sound systems, lighting systems, and TVs in our limousines and party buses. He also installed our camera security system, and after seeing the excellent results at work, I didn't hesitate in asking him to install a surround sound system at my house. I couldn't be happier with the results! Now, my house is the go-to for movie/wine nights, and all my friends love it! His prices are amazing, too! I got quality work for a low price. Trust me, you can't go wrong with Justin at Wright A/V!
