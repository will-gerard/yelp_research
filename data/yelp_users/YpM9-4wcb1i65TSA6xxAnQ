Really, Really RUDE hostesses today. Walked in about 4:00PM before they got busy. We were told they were setting up a table for 5 of us. A couple minutes later we were told our wait would be 20 minutes. Fine - we'll wait. Another couple minutes later two groups of equal size that walked in behind us were seated and we were informed that "all big tables have been seated and our wait would now be an hour". I pointed right at an empty booth for 6 and asked about that one. They said they're getting ready to seat it. These girls were snotty and condescending. We usually like this place. Never had this kind of problem before. We left and went across the street to try ZinBurger. Thanks Oregano's for turning us on to an amazing burger and salad place.

Been here many time. Bad food experiance today with minimal amount of sympathy from management and staff. Chicken was like pudding texture before cooking and not much better after. Manager explained they were experimenting with a new supplier or something. I should have been offered a discount, free drink or some incentive to come back. I wasn't - and I won't. I'll stick with the Henderson NV location.

Amazing service from the greeting at the door to the friendly and efficient wait staff. Burgers and Double Truffle Fry were fantastic. I got the Asian Chicken Salad. It was fresh, light and full of flavor with crisp vegetables and plenty of grilled chicken. It's a touch pricy but the servings are large and shareable if desired.  We'll be back.
