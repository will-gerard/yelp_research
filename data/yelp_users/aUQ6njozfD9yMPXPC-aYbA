I really was expecting more for being at the Esplanade. I would think that they would have a minimum standard or something, right?  Well, I had the grilled tuna melt. It was okay, nothing to write home about. My friend had a ham(?) sandwich and the soup, which he told the waitress was good but I noticed he didn't finish half of it.  I guess this is more of a bar than a restaurant but the food was obviously a low priority, even though it was a little on the pricey side. None of the veggies in my sandwich were fresh; avocado was not even ripe. Fries sucked.  Although the place was about 80% full, the wait staff still seemed surprised and ambivalent to see us come in.  I should have listened to my friend when when walked by the Quizno's!

All I can say about Wedsnday nights at the Whiskey is....Wow!  I only discovered this place a couple of weeks ago. Fisrt time there was a Saturday night and it was somewhat disappointing. But last night was ladies night and $0.25 you call its with a $10 cover. The place was packed. It was very diverse. My friends and I were more than a little perplexed by the back and forth swing of country and hip hop, but it worked. This attracts all types and everyone got along amazingly well. No attitudes in this place. In fact I saw a guy wearing an awesome t-shirt that said F**K SCOTTSDALE. It was perfect .  There's a decent size dance floor in the middle. Two full bars, a mixed drinks bar, and a beer tub. Waitresses scattered throughout and the staff in general is friendly and fast.  Oh yeah, this is important to some people - the bathrooms were clean,

Dude! There is a Los Betos right across the street from the Whiskey! When you're done oogling the girls on Wednesday night, go there and pick up a burrito. They're under $4 and you're so effed up that you will be thinking it is the best damn unicorn burrito you have ever tasted!  But I actually recommend the bacon, egg, and cheese. They messed mine up last night and added chorizo and it was the BOMB! The horchata is also sweeeeeet!!!  P.S. - Don't expect fast service. Do expect a line.

Why 5 stars? Well 3 stars just for being open on a Sunday night without a downtown event going on! We walked all over the stadium and arena looking for any signs of life. (I forgot how pathetic downtown is after 5pm). I remembered Seamus and hoped that it would still be open at this late hour of 8:30 in the evening. Sure enough, it was still serving beer. Yippie! And on top of that, the kitchen was still open. I ordered the Sheppard's Pie and it did not disappoint! In fact it was awesome!   There were still a few patrons in there, a good mix of people, young and old. I think some old ladies complained when I put in some Dropkick Murphys on the juke box. Screw em! The song seemed appropriate.   The staff was uber cool, too! Our bartender, slash owner, was really cool and talkative. The waitress that would come by to place orders would stop and chat, too. Very friendly staff.  There's no doubt that this will be my new downtown spot.

After visiting this establishment here are a few of my observations. There's two doors, a bathroom, a pool table (why? I don't know), tables and a bar.   Yes, it is that simple. But as we all know, personality can go a long way. The place is small and yes it is a dive. But the beer is CHEAP. When we go, we each get our own mini pitcher of PBR. CLASSY! The bartenders are not ever in a talkative mood, they will ignore you for a while and they won't ever say thank you. The people are cool, mostly. But I always get the impression like at any moment there could be shouting match between two hipsters accusing each other of being a hipster.  On some nights you get a really cool DJ playing stuff you'll never hear anywhere else. I like that.  I like it. It's a little far for me but I'm game if you are!

I come here often. It's real close to my house and very convenient for me. They offer what they call a Value Club that I am a part of. For 5 bucks you get a laundry bag that you can drop off in a bin. There is no waiting and you get a discount on every item in the bag. I mostly just launder shirts so my discount is always 15%. It's a different discount for different services.   The staff is always very nice (they're mostly teenage kids). The manager hangs out sometimes and gives his customers creepy looks, the only negative that I have. But they have never messed up one of my shirts, not once in the 9 months that I have been going. My last dry cleaner would rip buttons off a shirt at least once a visit. And my shirts are always ready the next day.  If they keep this up I'll never go anywhere else!

This place is what it is (an expression I loathe, yet it's so fitting in this case). Other Yelpers comment that Mardis Gras isn't sure what it wants to be. Maybe that's why I like it. It's not trying to be anything other than a place for people to come together and have a few drinks. The bartenders are nice and astute so they won't let you go thirsty. The owners are always there and they are real friendly and nice.  The food here is surprisingly good! You wouldn't think it but it's awesome. I'd even go out on a limb and say that the fries are better than McDonalds!  The place has a stage for live acts. My brother's band has played here with no problems and the sound system was awesome. Comedians come through here, too. There is a pool table, beer pong table, darts, Golden Tee, etc. There are TV's to catch the game.  Karaoke nights are great here as well. There's always a good mixture of people and nobody cares what kind of song you do. The KJ Shawn has a great selection of songs.  If you're in the area stop on by. Come witness the un-snooty side of Scottsdale.

Iguana Macks is one of those place you hate to love. Almost any night of the week is full of the usual suspects. It gets really busy on the weekends. There is a good mix of people and I've never seen anyone feel out of place. I love the patio, good people watching. Inside always feels a little too crowded.   Unfortunately they think that specials should only be reserved for Red Stripe (or Red Piss as I like to call it), ugh! The bartenders are some of the coolest I have ever met. The waitresses on the other hand.... With the exception of one or two, the waitresses suck. I'm not even sure why they are there. Most of the time I think that they are other patrons hanging out until I see one carrying a tray. Security here is really cool, too. They've always acted appropriately, and on occasion have given us slack we didn't deserve.   As I only come here to drink at night, I have never eaten anything here but it must not be that bad. Macks is owned by the same owners of the Chandler institution known as Riga Tony's, which has a longer history in Chandler than I do. There is a dining room and the few times that I have been here around dinner time the place has been full. And I believe that the kitchen is open until 2am.   Many nights they have live music. Sometimes out on the patio or on the stage inside next to the dance floor. And sometimes both.   If you're ever in Chandler you'll know that the pickins is slim in the bar department. Macks is never a bad choice if all you want to do is have a beer and chill.

Just like everyone says, this place sucks. They're priced about two bucks higher than other places but they do half the job. Like others have pointed out they didn't even bother to wipe down the dash board, let alone the instrument panel and other parts of the car. The vacuum job sucked. The guy who prepares the car for the initial wash did seem to do a diligent job, but everyone else was bad. And they also went through me center console but it doesn't appear that they took anything. I've never been to a car wash that put in so little effort. I was the only car there, too. I will not be going back.

Oh, I love this place. The descriptions from the previous Yelpers are spot on. They play a great rock soundtrack. Everything from Led Zepplin to Linkin Park. This is not really a barber shop so nobody should be expecting that. It's more of a typical hair salon with hair dressers that are trying to get dudes away from Great Clips, and I hope they succeed.  Rock posters are plastered right on top of each other, made me feel like my bedroom from my high school daze. It really sets the atmosphere, like you know when you walk up to a bar and you have no choice but to sit next to the old guy by himself and you kinda don't want to but then you realize that you know that at least you're in for an interesting conversation. It's that kind of atmosphere, cause I usually don't talk much to my stylist but these girls can talk, and they do. But it's always fun.   For around $25 you get your hair shampooed and conditionered (?), a hair cut, razor cut around the back edges, hot steam towels, and an awesome massage with some contraption that is best described as a vibrating glove (I'm afraid to go into any more detail than that).  A couple TV's have sports on them. There's also a couple computers with internet so you can surf while you wait. They also do color and other girlie things, I don't know.  I've never had a bad haircut here and I almost everyone there has done my hair at least once. Great place! Check em out!

Something about this place makes me want to hate it. But it's always come through for me. I always find a beer that fits my mood. And the few times I couldn't agree with a beer they replaced it free if charge! The food also never disappoints. It's pretty good. Maybe slight pricey, but not bad. And the happy hour entr√©es are great and priced well. When the weather is right, the patio is no doubt the best place to hang and people watch.

Oh Dos Gringos, how doth one review ye?  What is Dos Gringos? Honestly I never thought about it until I started this review. I would say first and foremost this is a place to drink, although they don't have any draught beers on tap. But they do have a decent selection of bottled beers. They do have one tap behind the bar but it only spits out margarita mix. And of course, they'll mix you a drink, too.  The layout of the place is a little different but it works well. As soon as you enter there is a center bar, a la Cheers. There are couple of SD TV's over the bartenders. The bar is surrounded by various tables. This area is sort of outside, so one can smoke if they like. The area just behind the bar holds more tables, HD TV's, a corn hole court, and of course the mandatory Golden Tee and Buck Hunter. Beyond this area is an inside dining area (no smoking allowed!) and another bar.   Don't let this place fool you. The food is really good. Come in during the day and you'll see families who bring in friends from out of town. I often see large parties there around dinner time. I haven't had everything on the menu but I've never been disappointed. You can't go wrong with anything chicken; it is well marinated! And I've heard that they have a Sunday all-you-can-eat brunch.  Now for the real review. This place gets packed Thursday night through Sunday night. But the atmosphere is always chill. The makeup is not as diverse as Iguana Macks next door, but there is very little attitude in the place. I always meet someone every time I go. The party is hopping right up until closing time.   All of the Dos Gringos have their own atmosphere and their own crowd that they attract. The Greenfield one is more family oriented and an older crowd. The Kyrene is just really sad and pathetic. Tempe is very much a college bar. And Scottsdale is, well, it's Scottsdale. The Chandler site really can't be pigeon holed. It's 20 and 30 somethings out for a drink in a cool atmosphere. And the best part of Dos Gringos Chandler? It's right next to Iguana Macks!

Slightly above Filiberto's. No drive thru but parking is easy and the wait is never long. The menu is also similar to Filiberto's, but for me that is not a bad thing. Their green sauce is better also. This is family owned and staffed. In fact, I've heard the family lives in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. I have never been disappointed.

Well, I feel bad leaving a review based on only being in the place for five minutes, but I was not impressed at all.   I guess this bar used to be on Chandler Blvd before taking over the old Famous Sams spot here on Alma School and Ray. Now the Sams was a real dive but I always knew that going into the place. The Stadium Club spent weeks remodelling, and honestly it does show. The place looks cleaner and is a little classier. We went there on a Sunday afternoon to catch a game. They had plenty of new Hi Def TV's but they did something I can't stand: Standard Definition on all their Hi Def TV's! If you're gonna do that you might as well put in standard TV's; why? Cause it will look better. We had trouble just reading the scores and the screen stretch meant we were missing part of the game.  But in reality we left because after five minutes there was still no bartender to be found. We sat there looking over the taps and making small talk with the few bar flies that were in the place. No beer for us. Oh well, we can spend our money somewhere else, easily.  With a few choices within a one mile radius, we decided to bail. Will I be back? Not by my choice.

Great theater. Great staff. Great customers. I hate going to the movies because I hate the crowds and annoying people in the theater but I've never had a bad time there. The lines at concessions moves fast. And the staff knows how to handle large crowds for the big movies. Harkins is always a step above all the rest.

I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, especially about the service. A bunch of us went there to see a UFC fight and the placed was packed! There weren't any tables left but their front patio (they have 2 patios, the front one is smoke free) had a lot of space for standing. The waitress saw us standing, took our order, and offered to find us bar stools, as well. She was very attentive and great.   Nonetheless, we put our name in for a table inside since we still had a few more friends coming. The hostess informed us that getting a table may not happen but that they will try. Sure enough 30 minutes later a table opened up and we were seated. The outside waitress was amazing and closed us out and transferred us without any problems or attitude.   The inside waitress was great, too! She saw that we were a pretty big group and we tend to be somewhat demande, yet fun, so she had a second waitress to wait on us. Our beers never sat empty and the two of them were very very attentive and a lot of fun. And the food was excellent!  This place is great and located in a location that needs more of these kinds of places. Please give them a chance if you are in the neighborhood. I can't wait to go back!
