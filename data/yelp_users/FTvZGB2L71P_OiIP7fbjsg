After a 10mins wait, I got to sit at the bar which was totally awesome. The food is good. I got the beef iron cast and the curry beef udon. Both were delicious and came in big bowls. The only down side was the appetizer and how they put in our food. When I ordered, I chose an appetizer which the server said it was shrimp dumplings, however, what we got were shrimp shuimai. If I knew it was shrimp shuimai, I wouldn't have ordered it because of the obvious differences between the two. This is the probably just the Asian side in me but that bothered me because they are two different dishes. As for the food order, it took us 45mins to get our actual dinner because the server didn't put the order in until 10mins after we finished our appetizer. We spent almost two hours there for dinner so that's a big drawback for me. Other than that, I do think it's a good place to eat since it is very delicious with a cozy feeling.

Came here because I was craving for wings and was not disappointed! Great customer service and wings. I like the honey bbq(I can't remember the exact name). There's also a hot version of it for those who are daring. The wings are big and meaty which was great! The only thing I didn't like was you can't do half and half on an order because the server said the owner doesn't like doing that. However, since it was my first time, I didn't mind paying an extra $1 to get 2 separate orders so I can try the different flavors. I also got fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was deliciously fresh. Be careful to not burn your tongue because everything will be hot and freshly made. I will definitely come back to try the pizzas when I am in the area.

Awesome food. But 4 stars because I asked for extra meat in my dish and I got extra rice instead.

Probably the worst customer service I have gotten from a Starbucks.  I came in at around 9am for a quick breakfast and drink. I was looking for a cheese Danish but they didn't have it and when I asked the lady, she abruptly said "no, that's all we got out here". I understand not everyone is a morning person, but holly cow, it's so depressing when you walk in this place. The workers are not happy and you can totally tell, especially the older lady who was working. She straight up judged me the moment I walked in. I gave 2 stars because they did get my order right, they were just very rude about everything else. It wasn't busy but it was kind of early so maybe just don't go in the morning so you will get a better start off of your day.

Amazing people! Very friendly service. The owner and her mom are both very nice workers and people to talk to. I gave 4 stars because it's always busy since there only 2 workers here. I've seen them turn away customers before so definitely call in and make an appointment before hand.

I'm not really a fan of burgers but boy, their Delux burger is a must try!! It is delicious! Their fries are also decent and I like how they serve it on a mini shopping cart(super cute!). Their special dessert is okay, I didn't really like it but it is good to try.   The place is very modern looking and my server was awesome. They also have a sushi bar which is kind of cool. I think the price of the sushi is kind of overboard but I didn't try it so I can't say much. However, the $13 burger is worth a try.

This is a cash only place. The guys are nice and friendly. They give out pretty good hair cuts. The only draw back is the wait. It can get pretty busy late at night since they are the only open late barber shop around town. The wait can also be prolonged due to one or two barbers who still need training from the shop owner. It's a nice, clean place with your own cable tv when you wait.

Probably the worst place I have ever encountered in both food and service.   First visit: Called 15mins ahead and was told order will be ready in 10mins. Arrive and pay while waiting for another 15mins for order to be done. Not a problem. Got my food and my hunger fixed. Food was decent as it was just cooked wings are splattered hot sauces. Not bad.   Second visit: Called 30mins ahead to place an order. Arrive to pay and pick up. Cashier is not at the counter but in the back, behind closed doors, with 1 other guy joking around. The cook had to go get him to come to the counter. Whatever, I paid for the food and was told to wait, AGAIN. 30mins later, food is still not done. I went up to the counter and ask what is going on; I placed my order 30mins before coming here and now another 30mins wait? Guy at register told me that it's because the policy is "Order will only be process until customer arrive to pay" and that they have a new cook in the back; so if I let him go, I will be getting my wings in 5-10mins instead of holding him up here. Kind of rude, just kidding, it was rude. Whatever, I'm just really hungry at this point. By the time I got my food, I ran home and eat with my mom.   I ordered:  1 dozen of mild hot wings with salad and a medium drink.  1 dozen of medium hot wings with fries and a medium drink.   What I actually got: 1 dozen of medium wings with salad and no drink. I got 10 actual wings and the rest are little pieces-- see picture 1 dozen of mild wings with fries and no drink.   How I feel: Ripped off and pissed off.    I will never be ordering from here ever again and I wouldn't recommend you to go here either.

I love this place! It is a little hidden right next to Durant's. Their lobster and shrimp mac and cheese is AMAZING! I also like their signature burger as well. Service was great and the food came out super quick. My server was super attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. The creme brûlée was good as well. They also have daily specials and daily deals. Check out their website or just ask your server for more details.  The place is very calming due to the fake candle lighting and the blue lights design of the interior. They also have outdoor seating with cushioned seats but I don't recommend sitting outside at this time in Arizona since you will never know when a Haboob is going to hit you.  The only bad thing is the VERY LIMITED parking. Valet is complimentary but tips are always welcome(we're in America now). Overall, this place is awesome.

This place is a little sketchy looking at first. The inside still looks pretty out of date and ghetto. However, the pho is amazingly close to homemade. I've been to about every pho joint in Arizona and the soup here is the closest to home. The spring rolls are also big portions but they are not the best because it is served cold. I like my spring rolls to be warm to the touch since I don't like cold food. The peanut sauce was okay, I could make better at home but it wasn't bad to the point where I wouldn't eat it. Overall, the place have decent prices, great pho and okay customer service which is good enough for me to say I would totally come back here.

Parking here sucks so arrive early if you want the 8pm $20 board and wine special. Customer service is okay because they do get a bit busy. This was my first time at this location and my server was not the best at the beginning as we waited about 20mins just to put in an appetizer. After that, everything else went find and the food is always good here. Bruschetta and their house moscato are my best friends so I'm always happy when I get my food. I would encourage you to try their seasonal bruschetta, it's a hit or miss but it's worth trying!

Probably one of my favorite place to eat in downtown Phoenix. The place has a modern design and vibe with inside and outside seating. I have been here twice now and I keep running into the same situation. Granted, every time I come in, it's like at least 9pm.  Anyways, the first time I came in, I sat outside and didn't get service for a good 30mins. After 30mins of waiting, I finally came up to one of the girl and asked for some service. I wanted to walk out but they are the only open restaurant at the time that serves Kalbi short ribs(#priorities). We got service, finally, and everything was served very quickly and the girl did apologize for everything. When it was time for the check, I found out that they didn't charge me for anything and the food was on the house. It was amazing but I also felt terrible because I mean, I eventually did get my food so I left a big tip for the girl.  Second time I came in, they placed me in a very awkward seating spot and didn't serve me for about 15mins. I then moved to a different seat where I can be seen better but still no service. After 30mins, I was about to leave but a girl finally came and took my order. Delicious food like always but to my surprise, the girl also brought me dessert to make up for the service. On top of that, they also paid for the meal again!!! I felt terrible so I left another big tip for the girl.   So anyways, their service is good for me with everything that happened. Just not really great for me at the beginning when I am hanger. However, food is awesome, I like the Jerk Chicken and Kalbi short ribs very much! Dessert was good, I liked the coconut cake that they had there. Prices are decent as well and there are also great happy hour deals available.

Feels like home. I love the jerk chicken here. They also have Jamaican drinks available for purchase. Pretty good overall!  The place is sort of small with limited parking. The bathroom still freaks me out because it's super dark but the food makes up for it. The owner is almost, always there and he's pretty awesome at suggesting you on what to try. The price is a little high but the food is delicious enough to remind me of home made food.

If you want brick toasts, go on Thursdays. They sell out quick because that's is the only thing this place is really famous for. I like their drinks but their shaved snow was just not the best for me since I've had better. The brick toast is my favorite so I try to get one every time I'm in the area on Thursdays. It's always sold out on weekends and Fridays because they get really busy those three days. The place is nice to chill at as well since they have games like connect the dots and jenga to play while waiting or just killing time with friends. They also have free wifi and the password is located near the little hidden Asian snacks area by the cashier.

Quite a bit of a selection of donuts, sandwiches and drinks. However, I came here because I heard they have chocolate donut holes and was fairly disappointed in them. I did like the glazed donut holes which were quite large in size. I also ordered milk tea and Thai tea which both were disappointing to me because they were very powdery and chemical tasting. The boba that came with it wasn't very good either, almost rubber like taste. Overall, the place was nice, clean with good customer service. I would advise to get the glazed donut holes and smoothies without boba to spare yourself from the disappointments.

If you're in the mood for tacos, this is the place. Their carne asada is delicious because you can really get that "off the grill" taste. My favorite thing here is their carne asada-crazy potato. It's basically a baked potato with taco fillings. They also have a good variety of salsa and condiments on the side such as pico de gallo and cucumbers. I personally mix the pico, green salsa and a bit of lime juice in my crazy potato to create the perfect flavor and heat, but to each their own. I also like that you get free chips and salsa every time you check in so I put a little bit of that in my crazy potato as well. They have Coke by the glass bottle and delicious horchata as well.   Quick tip: come before dinner time (~6pm) if you want to dine in because it does get crowded and you might have to sit outside in the cold/hot weather that AZ has to offer.

I hate leaving bad reviews but I had the worst service here. Servers only paid attention to their assigned tables and big groups. Service was super slow, even for a soda refill. Appetizer came out the same time as our meal which was 45mins after we ordered. Not good when the hanger kicks in. When I went, I guess the owner had his family there as well so the kids were going crazy on the drums. It was loud and uncomfortable because it made me feel out of place, especially when I'm barely getting any service.   Other than that, the food was good when we finally got it. The place was descent with good parking and design inside.

They recently switched owner about 2 weeks ago. Even though I am a little disappointed because I am a big fan of the past owner's cooking(best middle eastern food I have ever tasted), the new owner is also a great cook and the food is still super good to hit the spot.  Lamb and goat meat are a must try! I'm sure they do serve the food on plates but since I like to eat with my hands, my meal was served on a flat baking pan for ease.  The place is very clean and has a tranquility feel. The display of menu is kind of tacky but it's still decent enough for you to read. You can get food to-go or sit in. There is a praying/floor eating area along with booths. This is a good place to go eat with your friends due to all the space they have. Bonus: it's right next to ASU Campus(Sushi 101 plaza).

I regret paying for this. The event is suppose to last from 5pm-10pm but everything shuts down at around 8pm except for the stage and food. I didn't even get to see the balloons because everyone decide to shut them down at 8pm. Funnel cakes and lemonade are over priced just like every other fair. The funnel cakes did taste good though so I don't regret at $8 but I did regret the $10 admission fee because there was no reason for an admission fee at 8pm when everything I wanted to see is closed by 8pm.

Nothing to complain about the food. However, my cane's sauce was limited. I ordered a sandwich so you don't get extra sauce that comes with it. I then ordered extra sauces because I'm low-key obsess with it. I learned that sauces are $0.31 each so I gave the girl a dollar to just give me 3 and keep the change.  I got home and only got 2 sauces in my meal. I don't mind the few stolen cents but I was sad because I didn't have enough sauce to dip my fries in. :(

This place has the best Thai Tea in all of the donut places I have been to. I like the donuts to but I'm basic and I only eat glazed donuts so they all taste the same to me. My favorites are the donut holes because the Thai Tea goes nicely with it. Prices are reasonable and the place is pretty clean with the one of the best customer services for a late night donuts place.

Good Korean food and the portions are huge. It is a little pricey but you do get what you pay for. It was very busy when I went and I waited at least 30mins for my food. I didn't mind waiting since the service I got was decent and the waiter did come up to me to apologize for the wait and kept updates on the food. He also offered more side dishes for me to try while waiting so I didn't mind since they were basically free appetizers to me. They have quite a selection for both lunch and dinner on the menu. Lunch prices are MUCH cheaper than dinner, but I'm unsure about the portion size for lunch as I only went for dinner time. They also have sushi on the menu.   One problem for me was the design of this place. I don't understand it. It's a little bit weirdly designed and off vibe for me. I don't feel cozy or comfortable sitting in the restaurant. It's just an off interior design for me. Another problem is that they don't have pictures on the menu to show the food. I like pictures on my menu so I know what I'm ordering, especially when I'm with someone who isn't use to eating cultured food. Other than that, the food is pretty bomb.

Hipster/Romantic setting. Service is always great here. Nothing to complain other than waiting time. Sometime(especially on Monday and Tuesday nights for $20 deal-bottle of wine and a bruschetta board) the place does get busy and you might have to wait up to an hour for a table. A good way to get around this is that you can make a reservation at anytime with a party of 6 or more. If you don't meet that requirement, there are also seats by the bar. I personally like the bar since the service there is more personalized and quick due to the many bartenders that are always there.   Favorite and most basic wine choice for me here is their Moscato. Their bruschetta board is always amazing but if you want to try something new, always ask for the seasonal, it's most likely to be delicious. Also, check out the panini and soup combo if you're not up to eating bruschetta. If you still have room for more, try their creme brûlée, you won't be disappointed.

This is a fairly new Middle Eastern restaurant in Tempe. It's a very nice and clean place. You do get a Middle Eastern feel and their music is pretty great there (if you're into their music).   Food and service was exceptional. Prices are reasonable and worth it because these plates are in huge portions. There is also an area for you to sit down and eat(my favorite way to eat Middle Eastern food) but if you prefer, there are also tables and booths. Mandi meat and Biryani chicken are a must try! They also have tea available for you before or after your meal, it's delicious. I came in late so I didn't get to see much of the bakery side of the place but from the look of it, everything is tasty here.   I'm gonna hold out on the last star because this place is kind of ghetto and has a scary/creepy parking lot. It's next to a motel and you can't park in the motel parking spot. You have to go through their parking lot and it's kind of creepy at night for me(a girl) to go there alone, so bring some friends!  Another reason why is that I wish they have a plate that feature different kind of meat instead of just 1 specific type of meat per plate. Maybe I'm asking too much but most places I have been to, there's always an option where I can get gyro, chicken and kabob all on one plate. Also, I love rice and yogurt but the yogurt here wasn't doing it for me, it wasn't creamy enough.  Overall though, I like the place and love the food. I will probably come back here again and also try some of their dessert since I was too full this time.

My eyebrows were a mess so I needed something done quickly. This was my first time getting my eyebrows threaded since every where else was busy. Clean and cozy place with great customer service even though she didn't speak English too well. It about 15mins to get my eyebrows and upper lips all situated. I am definitely happy with the results as the lady really knows what she was doing and understood what I want. The lady who worked on me was Bhabombi; if you like her work, come any day except on Wednesdays since that's her day off.  They are currently offering $4.99 eyebrows threading from Monday-Wednesday. My total for upper lips and eyebrows were $10 which was a steal!  My personally experienced though, I don't think my eyebrows like threading very much since I have sensitive skin but my upper lips are amazingly flawless(better than waxing!). Don't get me wrong, the lady did a great job on my brows because they are on fleek.
