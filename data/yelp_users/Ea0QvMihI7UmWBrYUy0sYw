Usually when my friends go on and on about how they love a restaurant, I can't wait to get in and try the food. Our tastes are often a match.   The first concern I had from the beginning was the fact that there was only one person of Thai descent working and she was slinging the stuff they were selling.   We open the menu to find reasonably priced fare (a soft spot for my wallet). Many of the dishes you would be accustomed to finding in any Thai restaurant could also be found on the menu here. Since it was my first visit to this establishment, I decided to go safe and ordered the Pad See Iew with Chicken. Once it arrived, I was pleased with the presentation. But in my many years of eating I have learned, just because it look good fo show don't mean it goin' da taste good!! To be fair it wasn't horrible... but I certainly have had better.   The waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive. Something just seemed a little off about her? I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that was off... but if I do, I'll let you know. Perhaps one thing could have been the fact that a table of 8 came into her section about 15 minutes after we arrived and we seemed to have been just forgotten.   To sum it up folks... if you are in the area and you want a REAL Thai dish with plenty of kick hit up Thai Hut on McDowell and 1st St. Amazing food served by the people that invented the stuff, and prompt extremely attentive service.

Let me just tell you... if buying a wig for an exciting night of Big Hair Bingo weren't enough the little Korean guy that runs this store is a hoot.  All of the famous (I use this term very loosely) drag queens in Phoenix buy their wigs from Panorama.  I spent a little more than I would have spent at a costume shop for my wig, but it is a high quality synthetic hair that will last a long time.  This is in what I would call an up and coming part of the city... be sure to stop by and support this great local biz.

Chinese food is one of those things for me... once I find a place I love, I stick with it!  That was the story for my last Chinese Restaurant until they abruptly closed one day without notice...yes I am bitter.  The restaurant I am referring to was a little place called "Silver Dragon" south of Dunlap on 19th Ave.  It was the Cheers of Chinese... I walked in and everybody knew me, and immediatley started to make my meal (they would double or triple it, if I had company).  My favorite dish, was called Singapore Rice Noodle.... obviously a rice noodle dish that included stir fried spare ribs, chicken, shrimp, green and yellow onions tossed with a non-spicy curry sauce.  When they closed, I was in a state of depression for nearly two years!!  Until last night, when I happened upon China Chili, not my first visit, but my first SIT DOWN experience with the restuarant.  I do what I have done at every chinese restaurant since Silver Dragon... I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered "Singapore Rice Noodle".  Much to the delight of my stomach, they did and it was EXACTLY the same as I remember it at Silver Dragon.  I am already conspiring to have it again today for lunch!!!!  Oh... they have the fastest service here too, not more than five minutes after we ordered appetizers were already coming out!

A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinner!  I've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment, and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days.  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these days.  There were 5 of us, including one fairly easy to please 10 year old.  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages.... IN THE DESERT!!!  C'mon.  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself.  It was only the beginning.  When the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered.  Picture it... a "hot" roast beef open faced sandwich, which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever.  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT, they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen.  How do I know that?  Well, you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave?  It's gets hard and stale, a texture that once you experience you won't soon forget.  When we told the waitress that "tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess".  Her response was "It is for me too".  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM, THEIR PROBLEM!  Enter the "Manager".  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps.  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill.  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything else.  If any of the restaurant staff reads this review, please take one thing away from it... You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES!!  If the kitchen truly was the problem, they needed to step it up!!  If the waitress couldn't handle the number of people she was waiting on, you should have replaced her or reduced her section.  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people, us and several others (and I don't think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables).  Ready for dessert?  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress.  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them.  I bet you know what's coming next.... What's rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies??  Don't bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you, because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave ya!!  In closing, do I think this was meant to be four star dining? NO.  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight? ABSOLUTELY.  Did we catch them on a bad night?  PROBABLY.  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience?  YOU BETCHYA!!  Good luck here, and I hope your experience is better than ours was.

Pretty embarrassing overall is how I would classify this place!   Here is how it went down... Our friends were in town from Laguna Beach, they naturally wanted to do something that would allow them to experience the beautiful Arizona weather. Once we paid the $16 per person fee for the "Pick Three" deal, we stood aside assuming since we told the girl we wanted mini golf first she would assist us with getting our putters and balls and we would go about our day. WRONG! The girl behind the counter went to collecting money from the family of 12 (no exaggeration) that was waiting behind us. Can you believe they actually got all their putters and balls before we even got the consideration of a glance from the employee.   Once we received our supplies we made our way to the course. Now, I have played at this particular course before and will admit it was an OK time. But this particular time there was a bunch of dead plant material laying in the gutters of what I am sure must have been flowing streams that are now just nonoperational. This must have contributed to the awful stench that closely resembled raw sewage.   Being that it was hot out, we went back to the concession stand and got drinks and refreshments. The only positive thing I have to say about this experience was the fact that their concession prices were pretty fair. After our quick rest and drinks we were off to the bumper boats to use one of the remaining two activities of our "Pick Three" deal.   There was no line so went went right up to the front. There was not an employee available to help so we waited around for a few minutes before someone finally showed up only to tell us that there were only two bumper boats that were operational. Being that there were five of us, of course, was not really an option.   By this point, I had decided I was going to make my disappointment know to person in charge. I stopped someone walking by and was directed to the park "Manager" who looked to be about 17 or 18 years old soaking wet. I shared my frustration with him and was offered to add more tasks to my "Pick Three" offering. That seemed pretty ridiculous considering nothing there was working anyway, so I didn't have to think twice when I declined his extremely generous offer. He then instructed me to visit the Fiddlesticks website and make a complaint to their corporate offices in hopes of getting new battery chargers for the bumper boats. Rest assured I will be contacting the corporate offices by email and sending them a link to this rave review!   So on to the next event, the go karts. We get in, I push the gas pedal just to be sure that it was working (I was a little gun shy at this point). The kart made a promising vroom vroom vroom and we all took off. After the initial lap was completed it was everyman for himself. Before I could blink an eye, my kart started spitting and sputtering so I pulled off into the "pit" and got out and waited the remaining five or six laps for my friends to finish.   Overflowing with frustration, we gathered our crew and left for the day. Each of us out $16 for what I would consider payment for a few hours of my life that I will never get back.   Stay away from Fiddlesticks and find something more worthwhile to spend your hard earned dollars on!

Karaoke fans in Phoenix, listen up!! I recently celebrated my birthday with friends and thought an evening of karaoke combined with homemade hats was just the ticket!!   I have rented from Karaoke Now on several other occasions for work and had been very happy with the quality of equipment. This particular event was no exception... IT WAS A BLAST!! A few of my guests were a little disappointed that the song list didn't include a few karaoke favs like "I'm too sexy" and "I've got you babe"... but like any good group of drunks they butchered other popular tunes instead!!   The only negative thing I have to say is, current economy considered, the price was a little steep at $162.00. And if you really do your homework after a few rentals you could purchase the equipment yourself and rent the crap ton of discs!!   At any rate... if your looking for a good time mix one part karaoke with an unlimited number of cocktails and you have a party my friends!! Call Karaoke Now!!

I had every intention of giving this place a chance.  Mostly because it doesn't look like the kind of place that people RAVE about after a meal.  Sometimes making a snap judgment is completely justified!  We were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels.  When she was asked about the "specials", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?  Then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills, leaving the issue unaddressed.  PEOPLE!... if you have a crying baby, FOR THE LOVE... take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it.  We opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of non-stop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server.  She no sooner finished warming my coffee (I use this term loosely, as it was more like colored water) before I glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see.  This was the nightmare... I saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose.  Anyone who's ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the DRIPPING BLOOD!!  You would think a bloody nose would qualify one for a break until the bleeding subsided, wouldn't you??  I don't think i'll be able to bring myself to visit this place again!!  In the mean time... might I suggest some food safety training??

This place defiently projects the "everybody is welcome here" vibe.  You walk in and the place is always packed with every kind of person imaginable.  Every Friday we meet up with friends for our weekly coffee date here and I couldn't think of a better place.  Try the mocha... hot or iced.  And make sure and get whip AT LEAST ONCE, delicious and home made!  The only negative... when it is packed it gets a little crowded and backed with people waiting for their coffee from the barista.

La Barquita is THE BEST Mexican food I have had... EVER!  I ordered the Chile Verde and Horchata.  Here's the deal folks, you know you are in for an amazing experience when the waitress tells you "I just made the corn tortillas this morning... they are fresh".  If you want an Americanized Mexican food encounter, then pull up a chair at Macayo's or Rosita's and drive right past La Barquita.  I look forward to seeing some other folks chime in on this one!  A real local, hand made, mouthwatering time.  PS $3.50 Margaritas all the time... $2.00 during happy hour.  Beat that Rosita!!

I'm over Pei Wei.  The food is consistently mediocre and the service is lackluster to say the least.  This particular location has always had issues for me.  Today when we arrived the young woman behind the counter chewed on her nails as she took our order.  The other young lady behind the counter taking orders was totally rude to the group ordering after us.  I won't be back to this or any Pei Wei... GRRRROSS!

Smelly Dog is a staple in CenPho.  I've been taking my dogs here for several years.  Previously, I'd been very happy with the service that I had received.  Like other reviews, I've always gotten great smiling service and my dogs always looked great after grooming and tired as all get out after doggie day care.  Recently, I got my little miniature schnauzer and thought "What a wonderful way to exhaust him... i'll take in him in for doggie day care.".  Never having actually looked at the facility where my little guy was going to be staying, I decided to ask for a tour.  Our request was granted (minus a few looks of concern from the staff) and we went back to the day care area.  Almost immediately my stomach dropped.  You have to walk outside the storefront to what I can only describe as a converted old garage.  Walking through the gates we were met by a gentleman that reeked of last nights alcohol.  We were not allowed to walk through the facility, rather we were shown what we could see from the gated entrance.  Bleek, boring and not well maintained are the words I can use to describe what we saw.  Zero grass and and old dusty ground is all there was to lay in and they only break out the pool on "special days".  Long story short there just isn't much to stimulate.  It is my opinion that a little bit of paint and some minor landscaping (fake astro turf even) and this place would be amazing.  I can only imagine my lack of excitement would be translated into a lackluster experience for my little guy.  Whenever possible I like to patronize local establishments before the big box stores.  Until a little bit of care is invested in the doggie day care facility we will not be back.  I really hope some consideration is given to updating the facility and hiring some more responsible staff for day care because we'd love to come back!!  The boutique section and grooming are all great.  I look forward to continuing to use this part of the business.

Dr. M... what a life saver.  I have been suffering from continual back pain for about 6-8 months now.  Finally, I broked down and went against my massage training and decided to see a Chiropractor.  I am by no means cured, but look forward to the day when I can be pain free for a day!!  Go see Dr. M!!

Let me tell you friend, Maizie's is the ultimate in local eateries! I live within walking distance from the cafe and try to the best of my ability to make it for brunch every Saturday.   The menu is simple, which I love because you aren't overwhelmed with a ton of choices.   The bartendress Tina is the best of the best!! Everything you want in a good drinkslinger... great conversation, sass and personalized attention.   Maizie herself works in the restaurant often and you can tell she has a real drive to make her restaurant a success.   My recommendations:   Brunch: The Classic On Central. Two eggs any style, home fries, spicy Italian sausage or bacon and toast.   Lunch: Tri Tip Steak Salad. Bed of baby spinach, tossed with some kind of vinaigrette dressing, kalamata olives, feta cheese crumbles and a decent portion of Tri Tip sliced on top of the salad.   Dinner: Any of the stuffed burgers or even just the classic Bistro Burger. Always cooked to perfection. Don't forget to ask for the Chipotle mayo to dip french fries in!!   You will love it!

So I have a pretty decent event coming up in which I will be gender bending... I decide to pull off a little vintage number. Ok fine... a size 18-20 "little" vintage number! We had visited Retro Redux which is just across the street immediately before popping in.   Let me just say the girl at the Retro Redux store, not friendly at all and it was hotter than the flames of hell in the store. IT'S PHOENIX PEOPLE TURN ON THE AIR!!!   At Hollywood Vintage, the lady that was working was rocking a 50's Lucy Ricardoesque frock. Everything that the Retro girl was, she clearly was not!! I explained my situation, that I would need a bigger girl size and she pointed me in just the right direction. Unfortunately, I did not find anything that wow'd me that day. However, it was a hoot to listen to my partner go on and on about the vintage "aloha" wear that they had. I am so proud of him!!   CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!! You will not be disappointed.

I have to be honest, I, like a lot of downtowner folk said that I would never eat at Local Breeze when they made Palette go away (Loved me some Palette). But I have to admit when I'm wrong... I.WAS.WRONG.!!   Great little menu, great little cocktail and nice atmosphere!! I had the Coca-Cola ham sandwich on pumpernickel bread and a side salad...It was pretty darn good. Very fresh and bursting with flavors... I mean how could Coca-Cola ham sandwich and a side salad with lime vinaigrette dressing be boring!? The cocktail I had was a very smooth (dangerous!!, LOL) Peach Tea which had a sweet tea vodka in it... highly recommend this.   Lastly, I have to give props to our waitress. I think her name was Tatiyana. Personally, she had no business being a waitress... she looked like she belonged on a runway modeling fashion... BEAUTIFUL & SUPER SWEET!! In all seriousness, this was probably the best service I have gotten at a restaurant in months.   Oh... I have to take away points for the lack of plant life that used to exist when Palette was around. I think that was a lot of the charm of that location for me!? Then again, it is summer in Phoenix right now.

I am not really sure if some of these other folks just hit the restaurant a little early in its inception or perhaps it was just a bad day?  I had a great experience at Revo!  I did not encounter all of the signage, infact I was greeted by what I can only define as a very modern twist on traditional Mexican decoration (pinatas, maracas, etc.).  Overall I would highly reccomend Revo to anyone looking for a good meal with homecooked goodness inside!!  The only thing I might change would be the over compensating wait staff... checking once or twice is cool, but six times was a little much.

Get it together folks! 30+ minutes on hold is unacceptable. Thanks for the hang up after the 35 minute mark.

How do you make America better?  Give her a second Taco Shop on 7th Ave and Campbell and let her feed the masses!!  The addition of this restaurant to our community is a welcomed one.  The space that the taco shop took over has been everything under the sun and not been able to stand the test of time!!  The service at either of these two restaurants is always beyond exceptional, greeting you when you first walk through the door and beyond.  I just finished lunch and can't wait to go for dinner!!

Win!  We were recommeded to try this place by Mr. Guy Fieri and Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Previously we'd had some misses with his recommendations.  Turns out this place is pretty kick ass.  Simple menu items and very affordably priced.  Now you're asking... how does it taste?  Ah. Mazing.  Got gitchya some.

It was so nice to have breakfast in Phoenix and not have to wait an hour for a table!  Perhaps there will be a wait once this joint is fully discovered.  Maybe I shouldn't be leaving a review?  Whatever.  I had the Chilaquiles Benedict... so good.  I literally could have licked the plate.  I almost had to take it down to four stars because the waitress was a little TOO attentive.  Then I kinda wondered if that was such a bad thing.  In a day and age when you are lucky if the server would even spit on you if you were on fire, the over-server wins.  That and the place was totally adorable inside.  Oh!  If you aren't a fan of tables with chairs, this place is all booths.  You'll love it.  Go.  Eat.  Be the chubby kid on the playground!
