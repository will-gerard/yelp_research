A little pricey, but happy hour from 2-5 or 2-6:30 on patio. The HH apps are enough to fill up on. We got firecracker shrimp & pueblo queso dip to start, both delicious!!!! Sangria, delicious!  Fish tacos, delicious. And, best dessert!!  Every dessert I've had here was amazing. Oh, and the sangrias are yummy too! It's small and cozy. Cute neighborhood place. But still haven't sold my kids on it yet.... I give it 5 stars because the staff has always been so friendly & great with my kids, the food is alway great, and it's cozy. If I could afford it, I would eat here every week!

I've been to this mimis several times as I live close....I've never been impressed by the service.  Tho, today, Erik may have been the only redeeming quality about Mimi's today.  He hustled and was friendly to everybody.  To start, the hostess, Kimberly was snotty. I was eating solo on a Friday just before 11am. She told me to sit and asked my name. I was the only person there at the time!! It took 8 mins to set up a table for me. I would hate to see her/them in action on a busy weekend morning.  I always order the pommes Benedict but with muffins instead of potatoes. It use to be on the menu as florentine but has been replaced. For some reason, the kitchen doesn't want to make my breakfast this way for me, tho they reluctantly did. This dish was really the only reason to come to Mimi's. Guess I don't need to come here again now.

I would even add another half star to this. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I don't think breakfast should cost $12.00.  BUT...... Food was so good!  And big sized. Biscuits and gravy are phenomenal, homemade. Meals are served with big slices of coffee cake. And service is so friendly.  There's a wait, but it goes fast.  We ordered biscuits & gravy, southwest scramble, and Benedict ole. Everything was tasty and hit the spot. Leaving here stuffed and happy.

I'm not even vegan/vegetarian. But this place is delicious and earthy. Trendy decor and very eclectic range of people. I feel healthier when I eat here. It's just sooo pricey. I get one smoothie, burrito & cookie for $30!!!!  That's a little outrageous. And the service is always SLOW. But friendly!!!!!

Artichoke & spinach dip was best I've ever had. Lobster mac & cheese was delicious as well. The food is very very rich, but so good.  Also, the place is tiny and adorable!  Great outdoor patio area too. The only unpleasantry I can find is the snobby server who said a total of 9 words.

If you hate delicious food, do NOT come here!!!  The only thing better than the benedicts, is the outstanding service. Bell & Amber made food dreams come true and happen to be adorable as well! The table ordered southwest Benedict, Irish Benedict, and the Neptune Benedict. All delicious. The only downside was a tiny side of hollandaise sauce costs an extra $3.25.  Oh, and order the homemade grilled muffins. You won't regret it. That's a fact, jack!!

I'm a sushi snob......and I enjoyed this place.  Service was EXCELLENT!  Our server, Ryan, was knowledgable with a great sense of humor. Food was fresh and big portions. They didn't skimp on the fish in our rolls. Garlic edamame was very strong so make sure your date eats it too. We ordered the albacore crunch roll, poke tuna, crispy spicy tuna appetizer, lotus roll, and shrimp tempura roll. Love the fresh jalape√±o to top!  Everything was eaten with no complaints at all!

Finally decided to use one of the hundred coupons for this place. And I'm glad I did. Pizzas were different and delicious. I love the laid back atmosphere and the staff is GREAT!  My server, Joe, was fun and so great with my kids. I'll come back.   On a lesser note....the hummus and a chicken salad was just so-so.  Good thing the pizza makes up for it!

I'm in love with this little place!  I would eat more salads if they all tasted this good. And they're bigger than big. The pear cobb salad is my salad of choice- check out the huge real bacon "bits" in my photo!  Small family bistro with friendly friendly staff- and who doesn't love a small family shop??!!  The owner, Chris, always says hi and cares.   Eat here & feel good!  PS.... Their grilled cheese is fantastic.
