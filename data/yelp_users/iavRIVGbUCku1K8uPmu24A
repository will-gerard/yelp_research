Ordered 3 large pizzas, two chiefs and 25 wings which came to $95 dollars. Ridiculously over priced and not worth even half that cost. The pizza hardly had any flavor. The cheese way overpowered the sauce. The chiefs were just okay but were delivered cold. The only thing that's earning this place is the wing sauce. Literally just the sauce. The medium sauce was delicious. The wings were riddled with fat and very veiny. I would of much rather went with one of the chains. I've have hotter better pizza from little caesars. Don't waste your money on this over priced pizza.

I absolutely love this place!!!! The beef bowl is awesome! Always so flavorful and juicy!! They do not put potatoes in their Mac salad which makes this anti potato girl super happy! The lumpia is my favorite! The staff is always super friendly and the service is quick!

Absolutely Amazing! Such a gem! Being a NY native is place warmed my heart. I had a good feeling when I walked and looked at the menu! When they offer blue cheese before ranch it's defiantly NY!   And to all the people talking about the service. It was good service, and the staff is 100% transparent with you as far as wait time goes. You had the option to leave and you chose to stay! So don't rate them poorly for your choice to wait.   My only recommendation is they expand to a larger location and hire more staff! You could really tell everyone was working extremely hard and more staff could help the environment!   Garlic Knots are a must have! Perfect amount of garlic and butter! Marinara sauce was fresh and home made.   Boneless wings were yummy! Love the sauce! Perfect, not too mild not too hot! And they were smothered in sauce! Just the way I love them! (It's a NY thing)   The pasta was good, loved the marinara sauce and they cook the pasta in sugar water, the old fashion Italian way! (At least it tasted like it)   NY CHEESECAKE was the best I've had on the west coast !

I loved this place so much I wanted it again. I ordered for take out. How difficult is it to read a order? I added blue cheese and I PAID FOR it and they gave me marinara sauce with hot wings? What idiot thinks marinara goes good with hot wings?   Garlic knots were not the same I ate 3 days ago, pizza was a little soggy.   Husband liked his chicken parm sandwich so you can have a star for that.  I also loved this place because of how saucy the wings were, so in the comment section ordering online I put in extra wing sauce. What did I get? Barely coated, dry wings.   How can a place so delicious and perfect 2 days ago go from 5 to 1 stars? I felt like I ordered from a completely different restaurant.

You want to have a shitty experience? This is the place to go. The chefs are the only ones keeping this place open. I wish the food wasn't so damn good. Service sucks, wait time sucks, food orders have come out wrong more times than I can count. Severs will swarm your table asking to take plates away that you are clearly eating off of. I had one good experience and that is all. I'm done. I've come plenty multiple times for them to redeem themselves and tonight was the last night.   I should have known it was going to be a shit show once I found out they were out of garlic knots and was served in to go cups.

In addition to great food, NYPD has customer service down. I absolutely love their food, and despite inconsistent service I return because I'm a NY Native and It hits close to home.   After my recent negative experience and review the owner or manager reached out to me and offered to send me a dining certificate. $50 dollars for me and my husband to return.   I went back and had awesome service and food. They even reached out and asked if I had returned and if everything was good.

Perfect, perfect, perfect! PHO is amazing! He does such great work on my gel manicures! They last for weeks! It's nice to go to a nail shop and have a conversation with the person who is providing the service and not have them ignore you while speaking another language to other employees! They have a great selection of gel colors!

Came here with a large group of 20 for a work event.   The staff was friendly however even tho we had reservations they didn't have enough room for the party so we had to split tables up.   The staff was fast which was surprising! The food was fantastic! I recommend the queso! Best I've had in a long long time. I ordered the wings which in my opinion were far too dry. Everyone else love their meal! I will be returning very soon!

I've been here more times than I can count. I've ordered a bunch of different things and never had a bad meal or service! The queso is delicious!   I recommend the Carne Asade! So delicious with the perfect amount of spuce.  The service is fast! There isn't a square foot without a TV.

This buffet was good! They had a huge selection of food and sauces. I think the cost is a little pricey, I understand it's because of the crab legs and seafood options but I wasn't interested in that.  Husband said the sushi was fresh and good.  The restaurant was clean and the food was hot and there were no empty trays.   The only reason it's 4 stars and not 5 was because of the signs plastered everywhere warning you of a 20% increase for wasted food. I only take what I think I can eat but when I was finished it had me worried that I was going to be charged for the 2 pieces of meat and leftover salad that I couldn't finish.

I ordered the lunch special online which made it awesome because I hate the language barrier on the phone. For reference their website isn't easily located. It's kingwokmenu.com order online there. Whatever site I used charges the business. She kindly informed me this when I picked up with ZERO attitude. The reviews of rude service are not accurate.   Cheap cheap!  13 bucks for two lunch specials.  Both were delicious, sesame chicken and general tso's. Not soggy and had plenty of sauce.   Bonus just like east coast Chinese!

So happy I found this gem so close to home! To start the employees keep this place well organized and clean at all times which can be difficult when kids are choosing their own toppings! My favorite is the Oatmeal cookie and cake batter. The peanut butter sauce is to die for! I constantly crave this place! I usually end up paying around $10 bucks for me and hubby to enjoy a sweet treat. Going during happy hour gets you 12 cents off regular price per ounce. The full size candid bars are a nice touch at the end. The combinations are endless! I don't think there is a topping or candy this place doesn't have.

I was unaware that the bar seating wasn't open seating. So first heads up is the bar top is the only open seating. Had the hostess greeted us upon entering we would have known that. (Minus 1/2 star)   We had a decent 5-7 minutes because the waiter came over, again the hostess didn't seat us so I suppose he didn't know. (Minus 1/2 star)   Always a winner is the O-Ring tower.   I ordered the Red Robin Royal which had a egg on it. Sounds weird and gross but definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone because it was delicious. The egg really compliments the burger!   I got a nana nana moo moo shake. Milk chocolate and banana purée and it was amazing. I will def be back!

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I'm rating on overall experience and not just the food.   We arrived around 6pm and to our surprise we were seated right away. I knew immediately I was going to enjoy this place just from the aroma! Everything smelt so delicious. The garlic knots were fabulous my only compliant was the marinara sauce was a bit watery for my liking. I ordered the anti pasta salad which wasn't anything to write home about. It had a strong olive flavor. (Avoid it) My husband ordered the chicken parmesan sub and I had the tortellini with vodka sauce. My husband is super picky on trying new places and he loved his meal which was a shock! I was hesitant on ordering a 16 dollar pasta dish but it was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! The cheese inside had amazing flavor and they were hand rolled tortellini! They had complimentary fresh bread, also amazing.   The only negative to this place that hindering it from a 5 star rating is the service. The waitress was friendly but slow to return to the table. The restaurant seemed short staffed. We had to ask for refills and boxes as she was not attentive enough to notice.   Another plus is military discount!  Definitely a must try :-)

Nothing better than late night Taco Bell!! Except when they fuck shit up. BACON CLUB CHULPA. I can tell by the picture on the menu what it comes with. The CHULPA shell, BACON, CHICKEN, SOUR CREAM, LETTUCE & TOMATOS. I get home and it's missing half the fucking ingredients. NO BACON NO SOUR CREAM and two pieces of chicken. And these fucks want 15 a hour? No.

I was referred to Dr. Ben from some co-workers and I couldn't be more pleased! No wonder half of my co-workers go to see him. Dr. Ben is so chill and laid back. He is honest and truly cares about you and getting you a better back. The adjustment was fantastic and I felt relief immediately. My insurance covers a free 30 minute massage which Sydney did. The massage felt great and was so relaxing! Next time I'm scheduling a hour massage! I recommend seeing Dr. Ben for all your chiropractic needs! He even gives out his cell phone number and assures you to contact him if you ever need anything. You can't find that anywhere else!   Side note! If you don't have insurance don't worry! His cash price for a adjustment is $40 and that includes the electro therapy after the adjustment. Most places charge $60 plus!   What are you waiting for! Go see Dr. Ben!

This is my second time here, and I wish I could give it 5 stars. It's my own fault for not making appointment. I showed up at 10am for a gel mani / pedi. I didn't leave until 1pm. 3 hours!!! The lady who did my pedicure gave a great massage but didn't dig under the nail at all and was far to gentle.   I had to wait longer for Savannah because the ombré I choose she was the only one who could do it. She was wonderful! All the ladies (well most of them) are fabulous! So upbeat and funny!!!! Next time I'll make a appointment so it doesn't take 3 hours.   Love this place!

If I could provide no stars I would. To start the only irish to this bar is the decor. There is no upbeat employees and you could hear a mouse run through the place. The food is nothing to write home about. I had the nachos which were bland, the southwest egg rolls which were frozen. ( I'm pretty sure I had the same ones sitting in my fridge at home from smiths ) and my husband had the salmon which had to be sent back because it was not cooked, nothing like some raw fish when your not looking for sushi!! What really ticked me off about this place was what I witnessed between the snooty bartender and a older couple. I was sitting at the tables around the bar and I heard the bar tender ask a older couple to get up because another couple wanted to use the machines at the bar. ( I get it, the bar is gaming and that's how they make their money) however the gentlemen was eating his meal still and I clearly heard him say, " no problem I'll put 20 in my machine and 20 in my girlfriends machine so we can finish our drinks and meal." The terrible self proclaimed manager responded "No you need to get up, they are waiting for the machines." I could not believe what I was witnessing, the couple ended up storming out with out paying because the bartender said they could just leave, and I shortly followed because of the disgust in the customer service!!!!! They need to respect their customers and not be so rude and demanding! If I could give them no stars I would!

Was not good at all. The beef that I got was full of fatty pieces that were uneatable. I was disappointed in the Mac salad as it had way too many potatoes in it, should of been called potato salad. I left hungry and had to pick up food on the way home.

Went in looking for steak! I wanted petite sirloin however there was only one two pack left and they were not good cuts. There was a man restocking the meats that approached me asking if I needed any assistance. I asked if he had any more two packs of petite sirloin and pointed at the only one left stating it didn't look good. He agreed and immediately took it off the shelf and grabbed a family size of petite sirloin and said go ahead and pick the two you want and I will separate it for you!   Super great customer service for a supermarket. Usually if something is missing there is no more! It was great to see him go out of his way to open a family size package and re package it just to get the two cuts I wanted :-)

What can I say, I love this place!! Yes some reviews of the range are correct, it's not a state of the art shooting range with fancy lanes and all the high tech stuff.   What Ted's is; is family. From the moment I walked into the place until I left I felt like family and that I've known the guys for a while. They were funny and joked around with me. Being a female and a gun enthusiast It was very comforting that there was no judgment.   The gentleman helped me multiple times on the range when I had issues with my firearms. They didn't just fix the issue they coached me and showed to how to correct the problem.   The selection of handguns is decent, I would like to see more options for rifles, and accessories. Especially accessories that are catered to female gun owners.   All in all I love this place! And free ladies night every Monday and Wednesday!

This is only a temporary review. We stopped on to sit a grab a quick bite to eat while getting our car serviced to our disappointment is was take out only! So we didn't get to eat there. The decor was nice and the store was super clean! Looking forward to trying it out when we are not on the run!

The idea is great but I recently purchased some at the foodie fest. To start $5.00 dollars a cupcake is overpriced. The packaging was terrible and I was unable to get the cupcake out without it tipping over and messing up the frosting. The first cupcake actually crumbled and fell apart on the ground. The taste was bland and noting to write home about. The creme filling was too heavy which causes the cupcake to fall apart. There was hardly any frosting and visually boring. I don't see this business getting any farther from the truck.

What a nice quiet little Chinese restaurant nestled in a huge shopping center!! The restaurant is small and quiet and the wait staff is very friendly and quick. Four TVs in the dining room make it perfect for a football Sunday quick lunch.   I ordered the dinner combination and for only $11 dollars you get rice, fried shrimp, egg roll and soup in addition to your meat choice! The food came out nice a hot and fresh. The general chicken was delicious.   My husband ordered honey sesame chicken and it was also top notch.   My only recommendation is serving more rice with the combo!

Slow slow slow slow service. Didn't end up getting anything because I was waiting in line for way too long. Seems like this place is disorganized. Serving shakes to people who already received them, even after the lady explained that they already got them. Seems like the place is ran by a bunch of teenagers. Which is okay, kids need jobs too however someone responsible needs to be in charge. Hopefully I will return and have a much better experience.

The apartments here are exactly what the pictures look it! They don't just look nice but are quality. I recently moved in and I love it. The pool area is like a resort, and I haven't seen another apartment with such nice common areas!   Yes they are pricey, but you get what you pay for.   The office staff is nice and friendly and personable. I was promised a separate garage that I was under the impression I was getting which I didn't :(   Every Mark Taylor community has valet trash service for $30 a month. Which is a small price to pay considering the quality of the place your living in.   The one complaint I have is, I have complained about my neighbor because of bass vibrating my entire apartment and it hasn't been handle. Every day my apartment rattles. I don't mind music and I understand I'm living in an apartment and it's normal to hear your neighbors however this is driving me and my family nuts. Sitting on the couch enjoying a film with the floor and hanging pictures vibrating. I am not exaggerating.   I wish I was in a different unit and my experience would be five star without a doubt!

Updating my previous review and giving 5 stars. After multiple arguments with me downstairs neighbor the office offered to move us into another unit. I was honestly surprised they didn't tell me to kick rocks! I was moved into another unit on the first floor and in a better location! I love this place!

Stellar service! I've read some reviews stating they treat young people and women disrespectfully. This is untrue. As a young female I have visited this location multiple times and treated with the upmost respect and taken very seriously when it came to my needs.   I recently purchased a UTG Scope for my rifle and had them install it. A week later on my day off I went to the range and realized the scope was shattered. I didn't mistreat it or damage it. I went back to Pistol Parlor because I could not find my receipt, and like a dummy I paid in cash.   I explained to Logan what my issue was and he told me that Leapers ( the company who makes the scope ) was very good to deal with and he would write me up a duplicate copy of my receipt. He apologized and assured me that if I didn't have any luck to come back and they will contact the company.   Outstanding service provided by Logan!!

Bulk, bulk, bulk!!!!! It's a mini cosco minus the membership fees! I love the bulk options and choosing my own spices, candies and even pounds of pasta. There isn't much staff around but the ones you encounter are friendly and always say hello. The store is always neat & organize. Keeping costs down by bagging your own groceries is cool except I can't keep up. I like to go late at night for this reason so I don't hold up the line slowly bagging my own stuff.

This location is a hit or miss however, I've had far more misses than hits. So I won't be returning. One recommendation, get a solid group of employees. The turnover rate is HIGH. The past year I've only seen one person there consistently. The food is just alright and I get "fresh to order" however one cook during busy times and you can expect to wait about 15-20 minutes. (not ideal for mall employees with a half hour lunch.)   The worst experience was today. I ordered beef & broccoli, it wasn't busy, there was no one else there and plenty of employees. I got my meal and took it to my table and the beef was RAW. Not safe. Not good. The broccoli was hard and raw not even cooked. After waiting 10 minutes I figured it would be well done. I didn't have another 10 minutes to wait for them to make me a new one as I was on lunch so I got a refund. Check your meal at this location!

If I could give 10 stars I would! To start the shop is absolutely beautiful. Clean, neat and organized. Every single employee including the owner Bethany, were friendly, upbeat and super knowledgeable.   I'm new to the vape world and they spent over a hour with me teaching me the differences and allowing me to taste more flavors then I can even remember.   I bought the starter kit and Brian set it up and fought me everything I needed to know. I will never go anywhere else for my vape needs. I highly recommend checking them out !

Disappointed in myself for waiting so long to try this gem!  I stopped in on a Friday evening and was in and out! Super fast service.   I did the build your own bowl. Steak, Rice and Broccoli with the spicy teriyaki sauce. Simple yet delicious. The sauce came on the side and was so good! Perfect amount of spice.   They have a huge selection of sushi, bowls and salads. Reasonably priced given the portion of food you get.   The restaurant decor was modern and very cleaned up. Staff was fast, friendly and efficient.   Only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the steak was a little cooler than the rest of the meal and wasn't sliced all the way through so when I went to shake the bowl up it didn't separate. I will def be back!

Love the connivence of this being located across from my house however the night shift lady with the short red hair is a god damn nightmare. Consistently makes snide comments on how my ID doesn't look like me because I don't look the same and I'm much skinner. This was a nightly occurrence until i quit giving them my business. I'm sorry that my weight lose is a inconvenience to your ability to correctly match my ID to myself. She even had the audacity to tell my 33 year old husband that he needs to get a Arizona license when we are dual residents of here and California because her machine cannot read out of state licenses. The worst incident with this lady was refusing to allow me to use a joint bank account card with my husbands name on it when my card wouldn't read. She's a nightmare. DO NOT GO....

This used to be a good a circle k, especially the old night staff. Went in and went to counter and my fiancé asked for two packs of cigarettes and the rude gentleman rolled his eyes as he had to walk two feet away to grab them. When he came back he pointed at me and said I need to see her ID and that's that. I would have no issue furnishing my proof of 30! However he was down right arrogant, rude and disrespectful. If you hate your job get a new one. I politely responded you don't have to be so rude and told my fiancé we would take our business elsewhere. Both of the Circle K locations on Gilbert/Pecos and Val Vista/Pecos need a serious revamping of night time employees. It's worth driving farther to go to a gas station where the workers at least pretend to like there jobs. The guy was bigger, and had glasses, was working at 10:30pm on 11/22. Thanks to him, my $100 weekly gas trip will be taken to Valero.

Absolutely amazing. I've been living in luxury apartments between Las Vegas & Arizona for 8 years and this is by far the best. The office staff is fantastic. There was some confusion during my move in and a miscommunication on rent and they took care of it immediately. The amenities are fantastic. I love that all the units have beautiful hardwood floors on all 3 levels. The only down side to that is my upstairs neighbor sounds like the opening scene to the lion king every time they walk around. The maintenance staff is always friendly and says hello.

OWNER PLEASE READ  Recommendation!  Your flavored crust options are so delicious You should offer Zella's Crust Sticks! Served with marinara! Please, please!!    I'm so happy they opened a Zella's right on my corner! No more driving to Power! What more can I say! $5.00 for a large one topping pizzas! Free flavored crust too!?!?! Nothing can beat that! I've never had a bad tasting pizza from Zella's. The ranch crust is addicting! I also order the boneless wings with honey hot sauce and the sauce is amazing. Every time I order for pick up its ready in 15 minutes or less. The ladies at the counter are always friendly. I recommend giving this place a try. Rosatis overpriced garbage has nothing on Zella's!
