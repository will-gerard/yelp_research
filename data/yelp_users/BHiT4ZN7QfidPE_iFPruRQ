Once was enough for me. Parking is a pain. The place is small and cramped as well as hot. They do offer drop off service which even though I haven't used it has to be better then trying to do laundry in this hotbox. I prefer the self serve laundry on mckellips across from the police station.

$8 bowling from 9-12 during the week. It's got a really nice bar area plus pool tables. It's kind of annoying that all the balls are kept behind the counter but no big deal really. The food is exactly what you would expect at a bowling alley and the beer is a bit pricey but atleast they have it.  I always have a good time and will continue to return.

I'm not a fan of this walgreens for a few simple reasons. There is always a line at checkout, the store closes at 10pm, and that screws me because the redbox machine is inside.

This supermarket is awesome. It has a starbucks, huge floral, produce and bakery sections and a drive thru pharmacy and great hot and ready food to eat.They even have 3 Asian sushi chefs in there every day rolling fresh sushi. Most sushi places I go don't even have Asian sushi chefs. Frys always seems to have plenty of registers so checkout is quick. Now if only the parking lot wasn't so full always that would be perfect.

I call VIP because I always seem to have a matchbook with a $2 off coupon lying around. Some of the cabs are very nice and clean others not so much. They do send text messages to you to confirm your order and when the cab has arrived. They always seem to have cabs ready and they arrive quickly. As long as they get me from point A to point B on time and without incident I'm happy.

I love this place. The food is always excellent and fresh.   The red curry is my favorite item and I find myself craving it all the time. The curry has a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies always have the right amount of crunch. I also love the chow mein, orange chicken and spicy fried rice. The restaurant is very clean and you can see into the kitchen which also looks clean. My food is always ready in about 10 minutes for take out and the service is very friendly.

If you need to buy tobacco products this is the place to go. Half the store is dedicated just to tobacco. They also have a drive thru for when you can't find parking in their lot which is full most of the time. They also have a small deli and eating area inside. This place definitely puts most of its focus on its tobacco sales as it should since people are in there buying cartons all day long.

This place has the best prices around. I drive from scottsdale just to go here. They have a great selection of tobacco, hookah, and glass products. In addition they have some odd stuff I've never seen before like "shrooms" for tea. And yes I was told they are the psychedelic kind. They also have a punch card where you get a discount after 10 visits. The staff is friendly and helpful and its never to busy so you can get in and out quick. This is my preferred smoke shop in an area that has an abundance of them.

I'll start by saying that of course the drive-thru is 24hrs so you can get your donuts fix any time. No matter what time I go the donuts always seem fresh. They have donuts holes 12 for .99cents. What more can I say any donut you could want at any time its great.

This gym has plenty of space to workout and not feel like you're on top of anyone. They have a large selection of cardio and weight lifting machines as well as free weights and bench press and squat stations. It's all you could ask for from a gym that is $10 a month and $1 down.
