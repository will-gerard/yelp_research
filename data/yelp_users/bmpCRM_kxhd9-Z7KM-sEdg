Decided to try a thin crust pizza from Papa Johns last night, delivery.  When it arrived, it looked like it had been made yesterday and barely warm.  The crust was so dry, I think the cardboard box would have tasted better.  Worst pizza I've had in years.

Ridiculous!  They missed 2 appointments in a row.  I think the guy on the phone just sets appointments and never shows up.  NEVER CALL THEM!

Just gets worse.  $2 for a tiny bit of guac.  Even though you have to pay extra for chips and salsa, you have to ask special to get the salsa, and you get a cup that's too tiny to dip the chip in.

Nice for a change.  Chill fish place in Old Town.  Loved it.  Cool nautical atmosphere, good selection of drinks, and great food!
