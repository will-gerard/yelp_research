This place never does a good job. I have taken it there time and time again thinking I just got a bad crew that day but every time I leave disappointed. I had them do an interior detail which cost me $100.00 and they didn't even wipe down the insides of the doors after it ran through their car washing machine. They were all wet and still had dirt on them. This last time  I had gotten home before I noticed that they didn't vacuum/clean out the cup holder area in my center console. So, it would seem that it doesn't matter whether you pay $100.00 or $13.00 the job is still crappy!

This is THE best place in the whole country for Chinese food. My husband and I have been going there for 13 years and will never go anywhere else for Chinese. The owners are the best! They are so friendly and they treat us like family every time we come in.  Lunch time gets really really busy but they handle it well and get the food out quickly.  We eat the Kung Pao Beef. It's one of the few places in the valley that deep fries the meat. OMG it's sooooooo good! We like their crab puffs and eggrolls too. Their hot and spicy soup is bar none the best we've had. Our kids get the beef lomein and it's great too.

My husband and I met some friends here on a Friday night around 6. First, the parking sucks! There just isn't any. Second, it's packed so expect to wait for a table. The food however was great or at least what we ordered was.   I ordered the shaved rib eye cheese steak and it was so good I couldn't believe it! They make it with shaved ribeye some kind of good cheese, banana peppers all on their own beer bread which is kind of like pita bread but made with their beer. It's is so good! My husband thinks the banana peppers make it too spicy so he opts to not have them on his. I think the amount of spiciness it adds is perfect. We also got the nachos on their app menu and the nacho portion was huge!!!!! It had all kinds of stuff you would expect to see on Nachos. Sour Cream, guac, tomatoes, olives, beef, and I think it even had black beans. I would recommend them if you like nachos.  We also got the pork pibble one time when we went. It's excellent. I think it was on a special they had that night. It's a spicy roasted pork that they serve with black beans and tortillas.   The kids loved the chicken tenders and the sliders. The chicken was juicy and they weren't those frozen pieces that come out of a bag. The portion size was good also.   My recommendation is, if you don't like waiting then go early or don't go on the weekend.

Ok first off I have been a long time, and I mean long time, customer of Verizon Wireless... I'm talkin 15 years! So a friend of mine tells me on June 27th that I need to use my upgrade by tomorrow (June 28th) in order to renew my current contract and retain my unlimited data package. I called Verizon's customer service that day, the 27th, and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no, that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all. Specifically, my unlimited data plan. In an effort to cover all my bases I had my husband call and confirm this also. They told him the same thing, that nothing would change and that we did not need to upgrade until we wanted to. So fast forward to today, June 20th, I go into the Verizon store in Chandler on Frye road. The salesman tells me that upon upgrading I will need to decide on which new plan I would like to move to. I'm like, what?!?!?! I explained to him that I spoke with a Verizon representative back in June who assured me that I would not loose my current unlimited plan when I upgraded and signed the new 2 year contract. He told me, and these were his words, "Well, the lied to you"! WTH!!!!! I was majorly p'd off!!!!! I told him that I would not be upgrading anything until I called into the Verizon's customer service department to get this all worked out. So, I go home and we call and we get the same ol rigamarol from Terrence, the Verizon rep. Blah blah blah.... can I please speak to your manager... 15 minutes later (yes I was on hold for 15 minutes), Alisha the so called manager gets on the phone. She apologizes, not in a nice way, and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us. She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question. I call BS on that! I called one day before the new "plans" rolled out. You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one. I think not! Long story short, she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me. I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider. I feel I have been lied to and that they don't give a damn about their customers. I refuse to pay anyone for that kind of service. Good luck to all of you who have not upgraded yet.

This location was horrible!!!!!! First I called to ask if they had a certain flavor which they did not. They told me I could download their mobile app so I could see which stores offered the favors I wanted. I tried to download the app but the link was broken. I decide to still head over there and give it a try.... The parking sucked, they didn't have chocolate yogurt and hey didn't accept any bills larger than a $20. What really irked me was that they didn't have one of the staples of every yogurt shop in America!!!!!!!

Just rented a space for our truck and trailer. The management team was very helpful and knowledgeable about the services offered. They gave me a great deal on this rental! I would use them again in a heartbeat!
