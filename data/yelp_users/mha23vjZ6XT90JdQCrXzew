Braidy Hunt is amazing and is the only person I trust with my fragile blonde hair.  I've been going to her for several years, and she did my extensions for my wedding.  She is always up to date on all the latest techniques and products, and she has single handily transformed my hair and helped me get it healthy again.  I highly recommend her to anyone looking for extensions, color, or even to correct someone else's work.  She is a genuinely good person and will take care of you and make sure you are happy with your result.

Michael Boehm at Chapman BMW Chandler is the BEST!  My husband and I drive 50 minutes from North Scottsdale because we love this dealership.  There are none of the ridiculous back and forth negotiations, it's straight to point, which we both appreciate. Tony in service is absolutely incredible.  I've never waited more than 10 minutes while my car was serviced before I was in a loaner vehicle.  The kind of customer service, attention to detail, and professionalism offered at this dealership is not found elsewhere in the valley(I've looked).  Give Michael a call, you won't be disappointed.

What happened to this place?? They used to do a great job, and had awesome customer service.  Now the guy who greeted me was a jerk, the lady checking me out was on her cell phone and didn't even bother to look at me during the entire transaction, and my car isn't that clean.  I gave 2 stars because my car is cleaner than it was, but I have a feeling this place is going out of business which is unfortunate.  I will not be back due to poor service.

Love this place!!! Not only are they fast, CLEAN(even the mints are organized) and well priced, their customer service is the best I've ever had.  They carry the clothes out to my car every time, and even open my car door. They do a fantastic job and I've never had an issue.  I'm so glad I found them.  Give them a try, you will not be disappointed.

The calamari salad(di sara) is amazing.  My husband and I even tried to get the recipe for the vinaigrette they use on it.  It's that good.  Although it's pricey, it's well worth the splurge every once in a while to get a delicious meal that tastes fresh.  Usually we pick it up to go, but the few times we have eaten there the staff was friendly and the service was pretty good.

Love this groomer!  She was able to help my mom's dog, who recently had one of his rear legs amputated, and was weak.  At the same time, I had my two dogs groomed, and I've never seen either of them so happy after an appointment!  Incredibly sweet, and you can tell she truly cares about the dogs.  Try dk mobile grooming, you will be happy you did!
