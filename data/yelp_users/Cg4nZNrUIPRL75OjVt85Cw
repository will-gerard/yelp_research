I'm still full of this delicious old school edible greatness! An amazing staff with just enough snark to make it worth your while. Delicious burgers and shakes...the breakfast looks great as well (we ARE GOING BACK). Oh yea one more thing- APPLE PIE.

I'm not sure if the delivery issues are with Pink Pepper or Grubhub...it was if no one who got the order read it. Veggie Curry had little veggies in it. My duck dish simply ...wasn't. From now on we'll just drive to "Mint Thai" in the future.

I gave the restaurant 2 stars. The food was good (great Hummus) but this restaurant was FILTHY. We were their first guests of the day! Floors dirty. display case filthy. Booths unwiped. Crap everywhere....

I love this venues concept !(they give back) Inspirador offers a unique mix of contemporary environments for meaningful gatherings, artful events, and good will.  Created with the trend-setting bride in mind and intended to inspire unique ways of celebrating life's special occasions.  Inspirador is beyond a typical ballroom--it's a story about the things that matter most in our lives.

There are so many other Thai restaurants that have better everything! The spring rolls tasted like fried paper.The curry wasn't very flavorful and seemed watered down. Service was as friendly as rabid raccoons. Yep....never going back.

Sweet baby Jesus! This was the blandest, poorly served Mexican food in the valley. The meat in the "mixta" was a unflavored mess. The waitress saw we ate very little and could of cared less. Old Taco Bell leftovers would have been a treat compared to this experience.

Great food! Fresh ingredients and flavor! Maybe a little better selection on desserts...
