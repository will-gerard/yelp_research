No alterations! Nicht! I have out-of-town guests and always like them to experience the wonderful food and service at the Rokerij. I was craving my favorite Carne Adovada (pork roast dish), however I usually replace the rice and beans with some of their fresh seasonal vegetables. Not this time! Apparently the kitchen can't handle changing out sides (as of a couple months ago). So had to completely switch gears and figure out a new direction very quickly as rice & beans are not my friends.  As expected the meal was delightful but still craving my Carne!!

What a great selection! They even have newer releases marked waaaay below the cover price. The people are very knowledgeable and could provide answers to all my questions - even when I only gave them part of a title. *Very impressed*  I found books from all the authors I was looking for and most of the specific titles. Did a trade-in on a few bags of books as well, and to my surprise it went much quicker than I anticipated. (We went in on a Saturday right behind a lady that rolled in a whole grocery cart full!)  Looking forward to my next trip in.

Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $. The music is fun and tunes everyone knows. The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepeño - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!  As with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please.

Tasty. Great healthy options. The hostess was delightful and extremely helpful. I went in for lunch, got the large and had enough leftover for dinner. I wish it was closer to home, but will be back when I'm in the area.

This is my new go-to beauty supply store. Danielle is super-sweet, very knowledgable about face care and I was impressed with her professionalism. I was initially assisted by Kat who was exuberant and helpful in getting me prepped for Danielle to do my Skincare IQ. Great teamwork!   Danielle easily determined a foundation and other skin care products for me. So far, I'm ecstatic about them all and she provided samples of other items for me to think over. She is a ROCKSTAR!  This isn't a store that is closest to me, however I may return here just to receive the same awesome service.

Service was s l o w. Toook a l o n g time for someone to greet us and when they did only dropped off menus. Wait. Wait. We ordered beverages and food at same time. Things showed up one by one...  I ordered the Spicy Basil which was very flavorful and I thought was the best tasting of the 3 entrees.

Really enjoyed the thai shrimp skewers, however could be a little more thai-ish. The apple asparagus salad was fabulous although spring mix had a few little wilty greens; apple cider vinegar dressing pleasantly surprising! Hard to choose from the diverse menu selections. Had a lovely pinot noir with my meal. Stellar service!  Great to see a non-chain doing well. Can't wait togo back and try more!

Really enjoyed the self-design-burger menu. It's a little over-whelming the first go, but I tend to be one of those When-Harry-Met-Sally gals when it comes to my food. So this was perfect!  Only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars is that when I order a medium RARE burger, I want a juicy red-center. It ended up being more Med - Med-well. It was tasty, so I'll try again.  The service was excellent! A real team atmosphere. KUDOs Indulge!

We had great service! Thanks Aaron! A girlfriend and I went here for lunch. We started with the guacamole which was just how we like it - chunky (made from real avocados), not too oniony and topped with a sprinkle of goat cheese. We also shared the Carnitas Crisp topped with a green enchilada sauce - very tasty although not the usual smokey flavor I'm used to in other carnitas I've had.  We complimented the meal with a sampling of margaritas: I had the "Perfect" - powerful good; good amount of sweet & sour if you like that (I'm only good for one sweet & sour mixed drink). She had the prickly pear margarita which went down very smoothly. A little sweet for my taste, but light and refreshing nonetheless.  Next I did my own rendition of the "Skinny" - margarita made with real lime juice (so no sugar) but topped it with Grand Marnier which sweetened it just enough for me. Fabulous! My girlfriend had it unadulterated and liked it.  I was reluctant to go to this place since reviews weren't particularly favorable, but all in all we enjoyed our lunch howbeit mostly liquid and the staff was very attentive.

I've had 2 good experiences here before. However I don't know if I can go back after today. I asked for a simple French manicure which I've had in the past many a time but today she just couldn't get it right. The filing job was horrible (very rough) and the polish application was sloppy containing lumps and bubbles. I had her remove it and I was going to do a solid color until I noticed that she had filed so deeply into the bed of one of my nails I almost have skin coming through it. She didn't even remove all of the polish from my cuticles. I was happy to pay for the removal of the previous gel however was charged for a manicure. A manicure that I could have done much better myself. I had to ask for lotion! -Which quickly and half-hazzardly applied to my arms and wrists. No Cuticle oil or lotion to my hands And certainly not to my nail beds. They were just going to leave them dry.

My new "Comfort Food" favorite! If you like varying the taste of your favorite dishes this is your place! Light up your palette with multiple savory salsas and match them up to a plethora of uniquely prepared gourmet tacos, burritos, and quesadillas.  I had the Mayan Conchinita Pibil Quesadilla, which is pure decadence all by itself. However, I paired a few bites with their fresh guacamole and one of the kickin salsas.  (Something with Cabo in the name, or the other one that looked very similar). While the presentation was beautiful, I started to break through the paper lining the basket. That grosed me out a little, but by then I was full and bagged the rest for later.

Divine Facial by Lovely Rebecca I took a girlfriend with me for facials & massage and we had a great time. I thought my girlfriend was being tickled in the next room she was laughing so much. (whatever - as long as she was enjoying herself) I had a very relaxing and pleasant experience with Rebecca, who was very thorough yet gentle. The climate of the room was very comfortable; I tend to get chilly in spas, doctor's offices, or massage rooms because 1) the A/C is usually cranked and, 2) I'm so relaxed. However, I was quite comfy. I will definitely be back!

The staff made me feel so welcome to my new neighborhood and more importantly took care of my eye needs in short order. My objectives were to get an eye exam and inquire about Lasik.  The eye exam was a joy with Suzi as my "Cruise Director" and Dr. Heffelfinger was very informative about my vision 'present' and 'future'. In the end I'm confident about my choice and look forward to next years' exam.

Had a lovely "mini" facial with the "Ted Gibson" of estheticians, the beautiful and talented "Carvell". (Yes, like the ice cream store) She was delightfully gentle and thorough and knew exactly how and what products to use on my skin. Maaaah-velous!  Also, had a beautiful mani-pedi with Ashley. She was expeditious with the cleanup, laquering and drying so me & girlfriend could get on our way. Kudos! Polish looked fab even 2 days later (I didn't screw it up).  I'm a fan and will be back!

Got served WARM wine and asked for a chilled glass and was defined as "high maintenance." (My friend told me after we walked away) When I order a nice glass of wine, especially for the prices in these Scottsdale establishments, I expect it to be served at the proper temperature. The wine was boiling hot and when we asked for a chilled glass or a cooler bottle, we got attitude. The manager did come over and apologize - offered a round which we declined. We saw him talking with the bar-staff a few minutes later. We go to this place often because Chris Parker's band plays here, but not for long if we encounter this again.

Valentine's Day: Fabulous late lunch and service from Chelsea. Everything was very fresh and simply delicious. I loved the Roasted Beet salad. I wasn't disappointed that I forgot to get "dressing on the side".   We love that this place is in the neighborhood and is a genuinely nice, quiet atmosphere with great healthy food. Hope Tryst can keep up in this economy.   We plan to check out the breakfast too!

Excellent service from the bar staff! Tommy is our favorite; kept us in stitches with his Eddie Murphy impressions. We had a few appetizers:  TRIO OF DIP: 3 tiny, yet tasty servings of each (hummus, olive tapenade, artichoke  aioli)  with crustini's and pita bread wedges.  BEEF CARPACCIO: wonderfully tender and sliced paper thin. The Organic Arugula with Lemonette was a delightful pairing.  CALAMARI: BIG chunks of tender squid (no greasy batter here) sautéed with Artichoke Hearts, Capers and Roasted Tomatoes in a Garlic Butter and White Wine Sauce - this was a dee-lish meal!   Next time we HAVE to try the house-made mozzarella.

I've loved this place even when it was *Shhhhh* Bomberos. But it's even better now. I like to come here for celebratory occasions and even more for date night. The food is fresh,  thoughtful,  well prepared and served up with superb libations. Some staff are more personable than others but all are good.

I really want to like this place but ... I'm just not impressed. The pork belly entree sounded phenomenal but was the antithesis of anything I imagined. The cube of pork belly was a brick of dried, over cooked belly of something - Not good. My husband's enchiladas tasted reheated with Chef Boyardee on top. The dogs will love the leftovers ... Maybe.

Crazy Shotz was the life of the party! The props are hysterical and made for some ...um ... interesting captures. Great way to practice photo-bombing! Every party should have Crazy Shotz Photo Booth - great fun AND memories!

I've used Fabness for several years with great results until now. I placed 2 separate orders on the same date, 11/29/2014. I received one order within the specified 15 days and they were perfect. I inquired about the other order, emailing on 12/16 and did not receive a reply until 12/21: ---------------- Sun, Dec 21, 2014 3:06 pm: Hi Patty,  Thanks for your email. This is a system generated email and not addressing your issue.  We sincerely apologise for the delay in responding to your email request. We are inundated with enquiries as it is our busiest time of the year. If your matter is urgent please jump on live chat which is available from the home page of our website...." ---------------  The subject line of my email stated my order# that I was inquiring about, but again emailed them on Dec 24 for a status. Response came 12/26: --------------- "Your order shipped out on 12/05/14,. UPS tracking 1Z1############### You should have received your canvas by now. Can you please confirm the address entered for your order is correct?" ---------------- The address was correct. However, when I pulled up the tracking number it had NOT shipped. Again, doing the job of the CSR I informed them that it had indeed NOT shipped and received this response: ----------------- "I am issuing a claim with UPS for the lost package. I am going to issue you a re-print. I will get this expedited into production and it should ship within the next 48hrs. I do apologize for the delay. " ---------------- Maybe I'm wrong, but UPS showed that they never picked up the canvases for shipping. Maybe they did and lost them immediately. I followed up 2 days later, per the email, requesting a tracking number... ---------------- Dec 31, 2014 11:08 am: "... Once your order ships out we will be provided with a tracking number for UPS. It has not left us yet, so there is not one updated." ----------------- Finally today...Jan 07, 2015 9:59 am ----------------- "Your order shipped out on 01/05/15, UPS tracking 1Z1##############. According to UPS, your order will be delivered on Friday by the end of the day. ----------------  These canvases were a wedding gift and involved following up with our friends to uncomfortably ask if they had received them.   If you can wait 5 weeks + for your product - go for it. They are nice. But you may have to chase it down. *DONE*

A few weeks ago... The crispy duck leg confit was reduckulously good. I would have liked more collard greens though. They satisfied my southern side fo sho'!  The pimento cheese spread atop of the Fried Green Tomatoes was a welcomed blast from my childhood past. My "date" had the cider brined pork loin which she generously shared a bite of - I felt while tasty it was a bit overdone - and a big spoonful of the brown-butter whipped sweet potatoes were so dee-lish I almost had to skip dessert. ALMOST.  The coconut cake, while on the dry side, was nicely held together by the luscious coconut pudding. Thankfully, we opted to add a la mode. No regrets! Definitely a good idea to make a reservation and get dropped off. Parking is ridiculous.
