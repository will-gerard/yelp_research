Support a local family owned and operated business!  If you need any sporting equipment this season head over to C&S Sporting Goods. They have a great selection of new and gently used gear.

I was super excited to try Gigi's cupcakes for the first time especially because it was my wife's birthday. Called and asked if they delivered, was placed on hold for an eternity. After 15 minutes of waiting on hold I had to hang up. I drove to their location half an hour before they closed, the door was locked. No one answered the knocks and no one answered a phone call. For first-time experience this was an extremely poor experience. I'll never come here again, nor will I ever recommend this place.
