I like to come to this Starbucks because their staff is definitely ON POINT! I've come here and the line is out the door but I'm out in a breeze, they are so quick on their feet and efficient. Another reason why I like to come her is because there is so much seating. Some Starbucks I go to, there's hardly and study room and I'd have to wait to fight for a table.They have a section outside that is massive and a smaller section inside but they have a tons of tables and a very large counter space. If you'd like to eat, drink, take a break, study or read, this place is the perfect spot!

I love American grocers, I love Fry's, Stater Bros, Trader Joe's and Sprouts but coming from a different culture, I can get most of the ingredients my family needs at these shops but I definitely need to visit the Asian market for items like Lychee and Durian for desserts or fresh Calabash and Taro for our soups. Not to worry though, Lam's got it! I also like that it's not too far from where I reside in the West Valley and the parking lot is HUGE. Another service they have that I like it, they'll fry up a fish for you for a small fee, makes dinner that easy!  The reason that I deducted the 1 star is because the place is definitely a little more run down, not too modern and it's not all that aesthetically pleasing. It can set someone off, but in all honesty, Lam's makes it work for my family so I'm sure it'll work for you.

I'm honestly an extremely picky eater as well as my family, maybe that's where I get it from but we've been coming here for years, and we've never had a problem. I'm now a Junior in college and I had my first plate of Mongolian beef probably at the age of five, lunch special #6 is a must try! Always have been my parents favorite but I ventured out. I decided to try their shrimp fried rice and pot stickers, seriously the best I ever had, no matter where I go, no place beats Dragon Garden. My sister heard my extreme happiness about our family favorited restaurant, she tried their shrimp chow fun, she too agrees that there's no place like the good ol' Dragon Garden Express. Some other favorites of mine are their twice cooked chicken and walnut shrimp. They're soups are also quite delicious, chicken cream corn soup with wonton strips are to die for!  My cousin is vegetarian so when she goes she gets their ma-pao fried tofu and their vegetable delight so there are options for vegetarians.  Their prices are great compared to all the other places around, super cheap for large portions, and I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes even with large orders of food. Their service is great as well, the owner and his wife are absolutely welcoming, and the waitress is always friendly. As for the setting, if you choose not to take out, the place is roomy and spacious.  There is also a table for outside dining as well just in case if you have pets. It's unfortunate I had to move out of the state. Not even going to lie, before I hit the road on my last trip with the move in truck to Cali, my last stop in Arizona was Dragon Garden. Every time I make it back I definitely make the run for some pot stickers, even California's Chinese can't compare. YES! this place is that good!  Good food, good people, good prices, good vibes, what more could you want? I'd recommend this place to anyone!

Aside from the checkout lady's mean mug my first time at Sprouts was AMAZEBALLS!   When I first walked in I notice the stores cleanliness and organization. I went towards the end of the day, and to my surprise the store was in tip top shape. Everything was in place, and they were fully stocked = always a plus!  On another note, We got some pretty good stuff! We ended up paying about $55 but we got a BOATLOAD OF STUFF. Before coming into Sprouts, I had judged the name, I had always thought it was extremely pricy, but in all honesty, it's a great deal there! The quality of the food is great too. I got a ton of nutrition bars on sale, eggs were on sale, and even their organic asparagus were on a deal! They also have a giant book of coupons so definitely check it out.   I also think that it's really cool that they have all these alternatives for people that want to eat/live healthier. they also have a ton of gluten free, vegan, vegetarian products, from food all the way to health and beauty! I can't wait to be back to try more!   I'm the next regular, that's for sure.

I haven't tried the food here yet, but the halo halo is indeed a new favorite of mine. When I ever I do try the food, expect an updated review! I believe it ran about 5 dollars a drink but the drink is pretty large, it has mango, various jellies, banana, coconut, flan at the bottom and then it's covered in shaved ice, milk and condensed milk and topped of with a large scoop of sweet ube (purple yam) ice cream. It's pretty large actually, we had just finished lunch and it was okay for 3 people to share as a dessert. Service was quite good, friendly people and I don't find the prices to be too high. I definitely will be back for more halo halo and I hope to try their other dishes!  By the way, it's not a stand alone restaurant, it's inside of the Mekong Plaza and stands food court style.

I don't give out 5 stars too often, but when I do, you bet it's well deserved!   SERVICE: Our server's name was Kat, or Cat, I can't remember but she said its Cat "like meow".  First, I could go on and on about how GREAT her service was. It's was mine, my sister-in-law's, and our friend Mary's first time there, and we had now idea where to start, it was such a large menu. They are a seafood/steakhouse but there were SO MANY combinations. She made recommendations for us based on what we were looking for and we all left so satisfied. Mary and I had the Fire Grilled Mahi Mahi with Risotto and Arugula Salad, Kat recommended we add the Cajun flavoring, and I think that made it all the better. My sister-in-law had the Miso Glazed Swordfish and I had a taste of it as well, it was OH SO BUTTERY! We also had fried calamari as an appetizer, and creme brûlée, also recommended by Kat as a dessert, and very much recommended by me now. As busy as it was she was on top of things and oh so friendly. Best waitress I've had, EVER.   PRICING: $$$  Pricey, but worth it. I could see myself coming here, maybe every few months, maybe for an occasion or a special date night. For the 3 dishes we ordered on spot, 1 to go, fried calamari, and the vanilla bean blackberry creme brûlée our total came out to $147 before tip. Each plate came out to about, $25-$30 each.   ATMOSPHERE: We ate outside on the patio and it felt like it was something straight out of a Nicholas Sparks Movie, light strings, soft music, wood deck, and lots of greenery.   OVERALL: I'd take Nicholas Sparks on a hot date here if I were 20 years older. Only kidding, but you get the point!

So, throughout the years I've always struggled a little bit with my weight and fitness. I finally took a stand and wanted to like a more active and healthy lifestyle and went around to browse gyms. I signed up at Lifetime in January and this was my 2nd time signing up. I've signed up once before prior to moving to California, but I remembered what a great facility it was and I deceived to revisit it and in the five years I was gone, let me tell you this place got REVAMPED.  My membership is $59 dollars a month, at first I thought that it was way too much, that's 3+ months at another gym but I soon realized that, it is well worth it. I need to be able to feel motivated, and have a place I can't WANT to come to, and Lifetime does that for me.  First off they're open 24/7 all 365 days. I've tried, 24 Hour Fitness, Fitness Works, Bally's Gym, LA Fitness and I've got to say that in comparison to these gyms, Lifetime Fitness is Buckingham Palace. It's the only gym I plan on going to from now on. They've got multiple pools, sport courts, rock climbing, free classes that start from 5am-8pm, a child care center, kids fitness classes, and fitness equipment galore. They've also got lots of extra personal health instruction, like Pilates, nutrition and training and yoga. They also have a LifeCafe full of great food and protein shakes, vitamin, bars, and anything you'd need nutritionally for your fitness goals. I've noticed that this m facility is always a pristine clean and the staff is ever so friendly! Come by and get a guest pass and you'll definitely sign up.

"Beauty is pain"- someone wise.   I have been getting waxed at European Wax Centers for years now, but I've never had the need to actually request someone. I knew they were all professional and skilled, until I met an the best esthetician I've ever had at European Wax Center. Elise made my experience so painless, she took her time, and was so gentle. In fact, her service was so great, I think I've found my long term waxer, she's my girl from now on. I had some questions about waxing other parts of my body and I left with no questions in mind. She was thorough and very comforting. She took the time to ask me all about my needs and also explained what I should do for my skin type and etc. If you're looking for someone to provide excellent service, and maintain a comforting atmosphere for you during those times where you're screaming "beauty is pain!", Elise is the girl for you.

My first time at Yo&I yesterday, I've been hearing such great things about this place I deceived to see what the hype was myself! I walked in and the friendly waitress greeted us immediately and she was extremely friendly.   We ordered 5 of the house specials and the order was completed quickly. Friendly and speedy service, bonuses and kudos deserved!   I tried my drink and immediately loved it, it was sweet but it didn't take over, I was still able to taste the milk tea, the pudding, the grass jelly and the boba. The pudding and boba were quite nicely flavored too! I want to say the boba was honey flavored, and soft. The grass jelly and pudding were extra cool and refreshing.   I want to say that out drinks came out to be about $5.15-$5.25 as our order of 5 drinks came out to about $25.and some change. A great size for how much they give.   Yo&I, although you're far from my residence but you've found yourself a regular!

I'm so extremely off on trying new Vietnamese restaurants because I've had so many satisfying experiences. I'm so used to eating home-cooked authentic Vietnamese food as well as living in Little Saigon, California where the most authentic restaurants are located. Not a lot of places meet the standard.  My siblings took me here for lunch on a regular weekday Tuesday and the place was completely dead, we were the only ones in there, I was completely thrown off, thinking why were they so slow? I was there already so I wasn't going to complain. I ordered their fried chicken with fried rice (ga chien voi com chien) and I am SOOOOO glad I gave this place a try. It's one of the best, and you've definitely heard it from me. The owners were extremely nice and their service was amazing.  I also must say I don't remember the pricing but I do remember that it was a pretty darn good deal.  On another day where my family got off so late and we didn't feel like cooking, my brother got us all pho and spring rolls to go, so yes, they have takeout. I had the pho. I had the spring rolls. It was so good, I do dare say it's better than most of the pho shops in Cali. You've got a new regular PT Noodles! Y'all exceed the standard.

Really upsetting, is what I would say my experience was here. Generally, I love Jack in The Box as it is one of my favorite fast food chains and I decided to give myself a cheat day. I got myself 2 tacos, which is what I wanted. Aside from that my brother, sister-in-law and I were wanting some chicken sandwiches and chicken fajita pitas, but 2/3 of us had to resort to getting burgers since they ran out of all chicken products. With the one chicken order, we used it for my brothers chicken fajita pita, and we love the salsa that USUALLY comes with it, I asked for it and when I went to go look for it in the bag and it wasn't there, I asked for it again, a SECOND time. and they told me they were out. While waiting for our food, the people in the car behind us were ordering food, and again, I heard that they were out of rice. In my opinion, I can understand that things happen, but when you're out of this much product, I don't think your business is up and ready to run, especially if your location is open 24/7, 365/year.

-But first, Coffee-   It was recently my first time at Colados this Memorial Day, and it was a wonderful experience! I was meeting up with some friends, and they were running late so I thought "oh what the hay, I'll grab a coffee as I wait" and I've come to a conclusion that the Island Latte is to DIE for. Coconut and macadamia goodness swirled into one cup over ice. So good, I've been back twice for it and even introduced it to my gal pal Joyce W., She loves it too!  When my friends finally arrived, we ordered our crepes, my friend got the whole grain strawberry, her husband got the chipotle and I got the morning. They also very much enjoyed they americanos and green smoothies. We all enjoyed our crepes very much and left NO SCRAPS. I like that they have savory and sweet crepes.  Later on that day my sister in law saw our posts on Facebook and she had us come back! We the ordered the strawberry banana nutella crepe, tostilocos and another green smoothies, also equally enjoyed and devoured.   I really like the atmosphere here, it's so cozy and very nicely decorated, very Paris! I like that they have tables and chairs for dining but they also have love seats and little sofas around for those who need to study and a quite place to focus.   Service is quick and friendly, I'm sure this is going to be my regular spot!

116 degrees. 116 degrees Fahrenheit. It was way too hot so I dragged out my cousins and sister in law for some Hawaiian shaved ice. I have been craving the shaved ice that I had in Oahu, Hawaii in a flower cup since I left that wonderful island 2 years ago. I've been trying to find it, but no one ever gets the consistency right. The ice is too hard, etc etc. The Frozen Monkey got it down tho! They have tons of flavors for the shaved ice and they also have tons of ice cream flavors. You can get shaved ice, ice cream, or you can make it "Maui" and get them together :). Something really cool is that they have Dole Whips and Dole Floats, the only other places that have these are the Dole Plantation in Oahu, and at Disneyland, super cool! The desserts were super yummy and the place was small but quite cozy.   You're probably wondering why the -1 star? It was packed! And they only had 2 workers, 1 taking orders and 1 making the desserts. They had 1 worker come in as we were leaving but still not enough! For me though, the wait is worth it on most days. We need places like this in AZ!

"Have you ever had Ramen?" "Well, you mean like instant noodles?"  One of my best friends Joyce, took me here on Valentine's Day because I HAVE NEVER HAD FRESH REAL RAMEN! I could say it was a far drive from where I live, but in all honesty I could see myself there once a month, it was tasty! I got the seafood ramen and a glass of water, I don't remember how much I paid exactly but I believe it was around $12-$13 dollars with tax and no tip, not bad for the size of the bowl that's given. It's a great atmosphere too, almost authentically Japanese. Service was good pricing wasn't too bad = good vibes and good food with good people.   The only down fall for me is that this place is SMALL. Where I was sitting, people would pass me and they'd have to squeeze through, some purses hit me, but I was too engulfed in my ramen to really care, so eh 4/5 for me.   Try it before you knock it!

"When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie, that's amore."  After a night out on the town with my crew, we were felling a little hungry and we couldn't decide where to go, so we all decided to see what the hype on Lou Malnati's was all about, and trust me, the hype is real!   After walking in, we were greeted and the staff was extra friendly. The my even had samples for you to try out while you were in line! The wait wasn't so bad this time, about 30 minutes. I also absolutely adored the decor, very modern and city, yet still cozy. It was also very packed but it felt extremely roomy and not at all snug. They also allow you to order your pizza ahead of time so that your pizza is closer to being done since it takes longer for your pizza to be made than it does to be seated. As for pizza, my sister in law and I ordered "The Lou" and I thought it was the grand masterpiece of all vegetarian pizzas. There was 3 cheeses, mushrooms, spinach and fresh tomatoes as topping, I wouldn't have minded if it was my last meal. It's that stinking good! The cheese was amazing too! That ooey gooey type. As for appetizers, we got the Malnati salad, with ingredients very similar to any antipasto salad, but this salad was definitely on point, crisp, and refreshing. We also got the buffalou wings and they were were gone in a jiffy, I liked them very much because it was the right amount of tart and spice. Lastly we also shares the combination platter with our group and that had batter fried mushrooms, cheddar, mozzarella and zucchini, also none left behind. I even asked my friends, "you know when you go to that great restaurant and you always find that one dish that's eh?" Or "it's alright, it's not all great." As of now I can say Lou Malnati's does not have "that" dish! I enjoyed all of our dishes.   The pricing was quite alright too! For the price we definitely got our money's worth since the portions are so large.   My experience was so great here! It must be something in the water, no literally! Their food is prepared with  Chicago PH altered water, tomatoes and other ingredients shipped here from Chicago for that Chicago styled greatness. Cool huh?!   I've never been to Chicago, but I can definitely say that I've tried Chicago style pizza, and it won't be the last time!

Bittersweet, oh so bittersweet. Tonight was great because of the people I was with, my sister-in-law and my best friend. Arcade games are ALWAYS FUN. The  food was 7 out of 10, it wasn't bad but for "arcade/snack bar food" it's was pretty alright, still pricey though for the quality they are. I'd say their dishes range from $15-$20. I honestly don't have very many complaints aside from the sucky non-existent service. It took forever for them to take bills and when we went to the bar for glasses of water. No, not the process but it took so long for them to even greet us. After we ate, we each got a to-go box for our meals. We didn't want to lug them around so we asked our waiter to hold them for us, he said certainly and we even wrote our names on our boxes, but when we went to retrieve them, they were no where to be found. "The cleaning crew probably picked them up" wait, even with our names on them? Even though you're a restaurant, and you should be familiar with your own carry out boxes? When we went looking for the front desk to swap cards and retrieve our leftovers, we spoke aloud, but were left confused even with security there, he didn't even try to direct is elsewhere or to let anyone know we were at the counter.  Also, this was a very slow, watching grass grow Monday night. Minimal people were there tonight, I couldn't imagine what the service is like on busy weekend nights.  If it weren't for Steve, who tried to offer to fix things next time, I'd probably not give this place a second look.

I would give this little shop 5 stars if it was based solely on the service. The day that I came in the boss was the one that was helping Jannette L. and I out, and she was the most friendly and helpful business owner that she could be. She told us about her deals and promotions, talked about the secret menu and walked us through some really cool ingredients and recipes. We ended up ordering a honeydew smoothie, the "special" frappucino (a secret menu option that I won't ruin for you), a horchata slush and a strawberry banana crepe with vanilla ice cream. The crepe was quite nice, but not the best that I've had, no complaints there. The "special" frappucino was way too bitter, the honeydew smoothie way too sweet, so sweet, you had no other senses and the horchata reminded me of that time I got shampoo in my mouth. This is not the worst part, our order came out to be about $38-$39 dollars, and that with the promotion of $1 off all large drinks. That's almost $10 a drink at full price, and I don't think it was quite worth the cost. Will I return? - I'm thinking yes because her service was so great, and since it's a new business, she might adjust her recipes with a few tweaks and the beverages might become just right. I'm thinking no because I think it is WAY overpriced. I guess we'll just have to see!l

First off, I would like to thank Yelp,  Hailey B. and CYCLEBAR Raintree Ranch for this amazing opportunity to find my love for cycling! I enjoyed the experience so much, I can say I came, I worked and I conquered. I worked up such a sweat, I worked my booty off but I felt so pumped after. Thanks to the great instructor Heather, we pretty much got a full body workout, and she created such a comfortable yet fun atmosphere for us. Good lighting, good music, good vibes all around.  The entire staff was amazing, they made sure everyone was taken care of, they provided food and drinks, it was definitely an event I won't forget. I definitely look forward to many more CYCLEBAR experiences, see ya there!
