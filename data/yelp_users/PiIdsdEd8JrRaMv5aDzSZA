An absolute travesty if you're here for sushi. An AYCE sushi menu limited to Krab (yes with a K ), smoked salmon, tuna, unagi, yellowtail, and rolls that look like they're made by Sushi-bot 5000 that shoots Krab as excrement. The fish themselves are atrocious and taste like they've had better days. The Krab seems to be some kind of binding agent they try to hide in every space imaginable just to fill you up. The sushi rice is the only thing that was prepared correctly and it was a blessing in disguise for it to be served by bushels in each bite. The service is borderline senile and their "AYCE rules" are written very condescendingly. As we were near finished, a friend had asked if I got my moneys worth. My response...  "yes, by not ordering anymore."

Welcome to Shill-ville AZ, population at least 2. Within our borders, service lacks any cordiality. Humidity and temperature within the walls are sweaty hog blistering in the month of January. Food takes a little too long for it to be called "Express" and takes even longer to eat it. Why? Because the cuts of meat are akin to those of urban legends more along the lines of Snopes. The only flavorings are eclectically listed on my palate as soy sauce and sugar. When asked for some Sriracha sauce the owner gives thee a look as if asked for pickled human placenta. Let this be a dire message to anyone looking for a true review... would you eat at a place that tries to imitate Yoshinoya?

I can't say it's going to swoop you into the streets of Shanghai but the $4.99 lunch specials here are blatant American highway robbery. For soup, rice, a choice of SOMETHING, cream cheese wontons, sit-down service and check-splitting, I commend this establishment for keeping its head above water. I shall return.

A surprisingly simple setup that blows air-bending slaps around it's world-wide franchise counterparts. The bread is soft and bears no resemblance to any yeasty aromas of it's SUB-par rivals while the deli meats are sliced on the spot. You can't really go wrong with that alone.

Pho Kim Ripoff...  heinous-snail-paced service, portions smaller than Top Ramen,  Vietnamese customer priority, bland broth, owner looks like a wannabe mafia leader, and non-pho-like prices... Pho Kim no thanks

Though you may need a PhD to figure out how to order using one of their slips, the service is outwardly cordial and they hand out samples as if it was National Tapas Day. The place itself is surreal as if in an Almodovar film. Opting for the sweet and sour chicken burrito, Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla, black beans and chicken fried rice, I was able to make an entire days meal out of this one order. The end results are remarkably melding and might I say a breath of fresh, greasy air. It works. It somehow works.

The search is officially over. Call off the hounds and rendezvous at Bobby Q. With a name so simple yet perplexing, it must either be the greatest or worst barbecue to have ever existed in this Quadrant. Like a gift from a god, their smoked ribs and brisket are tender to the touch and have the tendency to fall onto the table before reaching your plate. Such tragedy. Minus 1. Their sauce oomph is somewhat mild along with its sweetness and to me that is a blessing. Being a victim of the great-bbq-but-bad-sides or the so-so-bbq-but-good-sides, Bobby Q has made a believer in me that there is a higher power out there that watches over us and to those that do great things, rewards us. Mission accomplished.

I've consistently found things that were either expired, about to expire, or have their expiration date completely erased with acetone to the point where I stopped shopping here. They profit from buying in bulk near-expired products from LA and flipping it here where competition is near zilch. Though it's closer to my home, I'd rather drive twice the distance to Lee Lee's where the turnover rates are higher and their selection more diverse. Nevertheless, this will not deter me from flying Asiana airlines.

Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door.   The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely.

Serving what seem to be impeccable service and standards, Roka Akor pays incredible homage to what Japanese cuisine is, was and will be in the distant future. Besides the somewhat shakey service, the food and ambiance are beaten to perfection with the branch of a Bonzai. Even the ice for the cocktails are carefully crafted to fit perfectly into the glass. Every now and then you can see the bartender sawzalling away at big blocks of ice for the drinks including the ones made with their homemade shochu.  With a menu full of fish flown in from Japan, I ordered a wide array of their specialties to get a better idea of why Bon Appetit magazine rated this restaurant Top 10 in the nation. I started off with their salad with wasabi ginger dressing. It had a great balance of fresh greens and roasted vegetables. Then came the butterfish tataki. With a clean unobtrusive tone, it would blow the shingles off Roy Yamaguchi on his bestest night. The American side of me flourished next with an order of the chili serrano hamachi roll. Far from anything exotic or novel, it flew under my radar much faster than Flight 447. Without giving up hope, the chef's sashimi selection came with scallop, tuna, and salmon. The freshness and quality was so conspicuous that the only adulteration I could sense was from the molestation it took by the TSA from its recent flight.   The food was coming out with precision timing and I was thoroughly enjoying my honeycomb shochu throughout the entire meal. The sweet potato tempura and sweet buttered corn came next. Unfortunately, the sweet potato was of the North American genus that has the orange hue rather than its Asian counterpart with more of the clear hue. The sweet buttered corn made up for the prior disingenuous buffoonery. Much like the butterfish, it was another highlight of the night with its sweet ghee flavor and texture much difficult to execute on a grill. Lastly, the glazed baby back ribs came about. It tasted like it had been slowly cooked for hours. Tender with well-balanced burnt marks, it finished me off with an ending quite more than happy.   The dinner was coming to a close and I have to admit I was thoroughly impressed with almost every aspect of this establishment. However, there are two things I'd like to see a change. Find a new source for sweet potatoes and get a water filtration system because the tap water tastes way too tappy. Starbucks has one and they're nowhere near eloquent as Roka. Until next time.

As much as I'd like to root for the underdog in an ever-expanding world of franchise dominancy, today has been the last straw. I felt I had a connection with Jason's reuben sandwich, first few times piled high with corned beef and a good proportion to sauerkraut. I even looked the other way when I was charged an extra $2 for them to do half corned beef/half pastrami (I got the same amount of meat). I still had faith in them. Then came the last few visits when the service became senile-slow and the food quality atrocious. I'd give it one last chance today and it was indeed the final rusty nail in my shabby coffin. Apparently I ordered an $8 sauerkraut sandwich called The Reuben; with a sliver of corned beef and a mountain of sauerkraut, it was everything my liberal vegetarianism craved.   People of the jury, allow me to present Exhibit A... (photograph above)

Being accustomed to near-flawless Mexican food from San Diego, I have to admit I was a little hesitant to try what Phoenix had to offer. On the menu at Poli's, I was taken aback by the California Burrito, which normally is a ubiquitous staple for every local in SD. Could it be? Judging by the menu, the ingredients were the same. I must try it.   The burrito itself was long and must've weighed over a pound. The inner-ratio was spot on and the overall portions generous. The carne asada showed no signs of gaminess and the texture amongst the fries, meat, and cheese was of ethereal nature. Best of all, it costs about a dollar less than any California Burrito I've had in California.  An epiphanic sensation, I have now bent over and assumed my new standard for what is the California Burrito... in Arizona.

Aside from taking away all ethnic businesses within a 20 mile radius... me gusta mucho.

two of the eight reviews here so far are shills... can you figure them out?   to one... you've only been there four times? I'm sure you've picked up more shifts than that. to the other... contrary to your multiple experiences, i didn't feel so clean inside, especially after finding a rapanzuel-length hair in the cantaloupes.    my 2 cents: run... don't walk and don't ever look back.   Update: shills are now being filtered, but not forgotten.

The only thing contributing to the NY authenticity here is the service. The crust falls short somewhere in between the line of cardboard and the styrofoam you'll find in a car bumper. The pizza as a whole looks like something you'll find in the frozen aisle and tastes even more disintegrated. That may be attributed to them baking cheese pizzas and reheating with whatever toppings you order. It doesn't work that way and to do so in New York would be an automatic death sentence endorsed even by their appalled Jersey neighbors. To call Stevie's New York Style Pizza would be analogous to calling Digiorno Delivery. It's NOT.

A less-than-stellar attempt at something that should be in the realms of instant noodles rather than fresh ramen. Listen, I'm all for the underdog but to cut corners and inflate prices will do nothing but hurt business in the long run. On my particular visit, they were out of pork and chicken. Really? Out of pork at a ramen house? So we opt for the spam and beef. The beef I kid you not was 3 slices of deli roast beef. I AM DEAD SERIOUS! What kind of place are you running here? I mean I understand eclectic is good at times but roast beef in ramen? The noodles were Zeppelinly overcooked and then there's the heavily MSG fortified Tonkotsu and "Republic" soup that lacked any depth or long simmered flavor but sufficed in the dry soup packet flavor and an induction of food coma the makers of Ambien would show devout interest in. Overall, there's an aberrant discontinuity of flavors here at this establishment and I was unimpressed and unmotivated to come again. Either cut your prices (after all you're in college-town) or pack up your soup packets and take it elsewhere.

At last a sandwich spot that is not a last resort when you run out of ideas of where to go for lunch. The traits of their bread are masterly perfected to reduce sogginess all while having a slight chew. My favorite as of yet is the #9 Italian Night Club. It's what a true Italian sandwich should be sans a few bells a whistles. Portions are fairly generous and likewise the prices. As of yet, the service is beyond par and I hope for it to remain that way. Not quite Potbelly's but good enough. One caveat, make sure to not get a whiplash while watching how fast your sandwich gets made.
