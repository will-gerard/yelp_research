so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend. the restaurant is a fairly good size and we were there around 1145. it was so slow, maybe 15 people in the whole place. we ordered 2 rolls and 45 minutes later still no rolls. i stopped the server asked him what had happened to our food and he said "its out of my hands" i ask for a manager, he goes to the back to get her she goes to the sushi bar and this other lady comes over to us. she said well what do you want to do? get your food and go or just go? she was incredibly rude but we ended up getting the rolls about 15 minutes later and she says "hey thanks guys". WHAT?! She was the WORST manager i have ever seen deal with a bad situation, had no realization at all for customer service, none. i know we will never ever go back here again! oh yeah and when we went to eat the food, the order was wrong! ridiculous. worst sushi place, ever!

This olive garden is right up the street from my house, me and my boyfriend frequent this place as a takeout. We have never eaten inside, but our orders for takeout i would say oh in the past six months that we have lived here have NEVER been messed up, and we order here every  oh i'd say one time every 1.5 week ish. It is what it is in terms of food but it does the job and hey they haven't messed up yet so we are fans.

Went here for a nice dinner out with my boyfriend and it was wonderful, he called and made a reservation and as soon as we got there we were seated.  Menu wasn't incredibly big but big enough i suppose. He got the shrimp and steak combo and he is a HUGE shrimp junkie and he loved it. I tried his steak and that was pretty good too, cooked just right. I got the nut mahi mahi and it was pretty good too. The layer of nuts and stuff on top of it was almost to much but it was still good.   Service was great, the lady that seats you starts your drinks and gets them promptly to you and then our server was very attentive all night but wasn't bothering us too much.   Decor is clearly outdated but the underground thing is very cool  It was good and i know we will go back!

cheap hotel. very very cheap. you've seen all the reviews below me so no need to emphasize on that but really my room wasn't too bad, me and my boyfriend got a suite for 60$ a night, cheap but decent. not good by any means but whatev we were in the room for all of 7 8 hours  each night for only 2 nights so not to incredibly awful. but probably won't stay here again. on the casino, they still have the 3 dollar tables for blackjack and some pretty good slots. a cute cafe thats good inside of it to.  so exactly like the 2 star review states "meh. ive experienced better."

Went here for dinner on a sunday night with my boyfriend, had to wait in line for about 35-45 minutes which I found odd seeing as it was on a sunday but we were happy to wait as the bar was fairly close so we had something to drink while waiting. The decor is amazing, beautiful flower arrangements as soon as you get in the dining area and really just amazing decor. Service was pretty good. If you had questions about the food you would have to talk to your server that brought you drinks because no one was ever close enough behind it to ask them. Food was AMAZING. They had everything and anything. Sushi was very yummy, boyfriend had the crab legs and said they were delish really anything you had was DEVINE. We had probably every desert they had to and they were all so yummy.  Overall so so good and worth the $40 a person. He wants to return so for sure next time were there we will be back.

the pub. my favorite place to go to happy hour. the drinks are strong and cheap and the company is great. All of the bartenders are on a first name basis with most customers and are genuine and awesome.  Service is always spot on and the drinks are the same. some have said its a locals only type place which majority is locals but anybody can come to the put and have an awesome time. love love love the pub!!

Ordered take out here for me and my boyfriend on a sunday morning. Had to run some errands before i was going to go get it and so I asked the lady if i could have it ready in 30 min. And they actually did that! I got there 35 minutes later and they were just finishing boxing it up. We got the biscuits and gravy YUM! and my boyfriend got the triple play. The pancakes were okay he said but the bacon was super delish. Overall just a great breakfast and we will for sure eat/ get take out from here again
