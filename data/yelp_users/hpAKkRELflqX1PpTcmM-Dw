I purchased a Living Social deal back in September and have been trying ever since to redeem.  I had to leave when I did actually book an appointment because the stylist was over 30 minutes late into my appointment (I waited a total of 45 minutes) and wasn't acknowledged, except by the receptionist on the way out.  I emailed the salon manager asking for assistance and never heard back.  I guess I am out $59.00.   Too bad because the reviews for this salon seem pretty great overall.  :(

So FOUR days after purchasing my new Fiat, I got hit with a huge rock going down the 10.  I had no idea about windshield repair.  I was referred to Blue Chip Auto Glass by a friend and am so glad I was.  Kelly is a sweetheart and really helped me understand the insurance process.  And the poor guy had the hardest time getting ahold of me (my fault) but was super kind and professional.  Freddy and Robert came to my work and replaced the windshield in about an hour.  So thorough and efficient.  I am very pleased with their quality of work and professionalism.  I'd highly recommend Blue Chip Auto Glass!

This place is fantastic.  I had their bowl with beef, fried eggplant, saffron rice, classic hummus, and the kale salad.  I work close-by and plan on bringing my co-workers in.  This is definitely on the regular lunch spot rotation.  The peach-lavender tea was also lovely. Everything was very fresh.  Try it out! You won't be disappointed!  :)

I was stationed in Korea with the military, so I have been exposed to my fair share of delicious authentic dishes.  Koryo is really good.  Our server was very sweet and always on top of bringing us drink refills.  Great kimchi, spicy crab soup, and mixed vegetable bibim bab!  I'll definitely be returning with friends.

Lana is the best! I purchased a bridesmaid dress online and it didn't fit properly. I had very little time to get it altered or find a replacement dress. So I looked for someone on Yelp. Thank God I found Lana. She put me at ease and was able to make the alterations in plenty of time for the wedding. Besides being amazing at her craft, she is a true sweetheart and very accomodating. I am so glad I found her and will use her from now on!

I am a huge fan of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts, but this one I just can't get behind. Exceptionally overpriced and very very bland food.
