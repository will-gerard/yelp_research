the food was alright, but the if you want to be annoyed the whole time while eating by the loud TV, and loud music playing on the other room from some kids trying to learn how to dance than go here.  every time i went it just gets worst and worst, one night the girls that were rehearsing on the other room played the same song over and over and over again, i think the whole time me and my family were there thats all they kept playing.  we asked the waiter to do something about it but he says he can't cause they're rehearsing.  so me having a smart mouth said, well than i guess u just lost some customers than.  only if they had a sound proof door separating the dance floor and the dinning room than it would be a good place.

all i can say is... its hard to mess up a Boba shop :)  this place is really good, they have so many selections and also some small dishes like fish balls (YUM), french fries and lots of other finger foods.  also if u like import cars, just show up there before closing and you'll see all the fast and the furious wanna be's park their ride in front of the place.

out of the three filipino restaurants in Mesa i think this is the best, lots of choices in the food, and the cantelope drink is a must have.  the portions are really good, and price is very reasonable.  i took my friends there last week and they liked it.  only thing i ask the cook though is too go a little easier on the grease, but than again it wont be a filipino dish if there weren't grease oozing out of it  lol

a very good place if u just wanna chill, the atmosphere has a calm and relaxing mood to it.  the food is good, though the wait is a little long, but its well worth it.  the bar area is cheap, and the workers are very friendly and easy to talk with.  highly recommend everyone to try it.  also a very good place for lunch and its awesome that the place is open till 2 everyday and the sushi bar is also open till than.  So for those of you who crave for some sushi at 1 am Sake Tini is the spot to go.

my first chipotle experience was a week ago, my neighbor took me there, and wow!  how come i haven't been eating this stuff earlier.  the barbacoa is the best, and the burrito is so big, i wonder if i can eat two of them?  lol  well, i'm thinking about going there for lunch today so see you there.
