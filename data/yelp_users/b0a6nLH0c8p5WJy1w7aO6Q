China Chili is not only a 4, it is a very solid 4. I was on my way back to the West Valley, from the East Valley, and did a search on my beloved Yelp for a highly rated Chinese Food joint that was on the way. China Chili kept appearing. We called in the take out order, and it was finished before I arrived.   We ordered the House Chicken, Spicy Garlic Eggplant, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Fried Shrimp. And... BAM! It was bomb!  The House Chicken was delicious. Garlic-y, with little bit of spicyness to it, and a very subtle nuttyness to it from the oil in the wok. Great texture, great smell... It was fantastic.  I'm not an Eggplant fan, but my gf is, and she ordered it. She said the Eggplant was a 3.5. Good, but not the best she'd ever had.     The Kung Pao... Again, a very good dish. If there was a complaint, it was that it was a tad heavy on the zucchini in the dish, which was just a tad overcooked. It changed the texture in the dish in an obvious way.  Mongolian Beef. NOM NOM! Perfect. Great flavor, great texture. Very happy with the dish.   The Breaded Shrimp was perfect. I can only handle so much fried shrimp. Tried one, and it was spot on.   This was a perfect way to end a 15 hour day.

This is my hood, yo. I've been eating at TE since I can remember. Since before high school, I'm sure, but it is in high school that my most fond memories come from. After football practice, this was a must.   I've always been a fan of the terriyaki chicken, double meat. Haven't strayed much from that, honestly. So... Maybe it's time to try something else.   I've wanted to try the curry, but after going to Tokyo, and having curry there, I'm hesitant to try it. We'll see....  Thanks for the memories, Tokyo Express.

Reopened today (3/4/2011)! That in and of itself is worth 5 Stars!  New location is on Indian School, west of 44th St, on the south side of the road.

I'm not often to write poor views, but this one irks me. I've FLOWN IN no less than 3 times to have breakfast at this restaurant and it was closed. What airport greasy spoon restaurant is closed on Sunday morning? When we went in and asked why they were closed, I was told, "It's slow around here, and he wasn't making money." Did he expect Obama to come in and bail him out, or stimulate his business while it was closed? Seriously. Just a hint, here, Mr. Business Owner, but you can't make money if your doors aren't open.   We've instead flown over to the restaurant at Chandler where it is ALWAYS busy, and there was even a wait on the Sunday morning I went.   Put out a good product, for a reasonable price, with good service, and you'll make money, and you won't be slow. Not only will you get me in the door once, but you may even find me in there regularly.   I think I'll fly up to Sedona where I know they'll be open for 3 meals a day, 7 days a week.

I say that good service carries a higher point power than good food. She disagrees. I say it's a 4 based on my rating system, she says it's a 3. I'm going with the higher point total BECAUSE IT'S MYYYYYYYY YELP PAGE. NEENER.   We went here on a Thursday night at 7pm. It was croaking dead. Weird. Have all of the "new money" Scottsdale-ites had their real estate/mortgage/advertising/partner in a law firm income dry up? Flame away. I have seen far fewer small body Benz's and Beemers in Scottsdale as of late. Just saying... I digress.    It was all old people, and a few people sitting at the bar. Read; people with some money and a few single people needing to get out of their 900sq ft. apartment.  The service was fantastic. No complaints. The food was definitely quality. Not the best ever, but we were just going for good, reliable Mexi-chow for a reasonable price. We found it at Los Olivos.   We may not agree on points, or ratings, but we agree that it was good all the way around and we will definitely go back if we're out that way.

I LOVE Four Peaks. What I don't love is Scottsdale. Or the people who inhabit it, really. Including the servers.  I've been a fan of FP for a LONG time. Great food, incredible beer, and great times. On this occasion, and it doesn't happen often, I wanted to tell the girl serving us that she should get the fuck off of her phone, stop bullshitting with the bartender, and do some fucking work. Like serving us, because she voluntarily accepted a position as a server in a bar.   We got there and got seated at a high top, which we asked for. When I saw that the Pumpkin Porter was on tap, I HAD to have me summa dat! And so we waited. Annnnnnnnnndddddddd waited. And still we waited..... for a server to arrive to ask us what we would like to drink.  It took us long enough to figure out what we wanted to order before the server showed up. So, she took our drink order, and started to turn around... NOT SO FAST, MY FRIEND!!!.... we placed our food order, as well.   The drinks came first. Yep. And instead of a rum and Coke, we got a diet rum. YUCK. And so we waited.... And I finally said FUCK THIS SHIT!! and got up and walked my happy ass up to the bar and placed it on the bar for a new one. The bartender, in all of her preciousness, acted like it was going to be an act of Congress to replace the drink. Instead of simply replacing the drink, she went to the well, poured the drink, and left it in the window to be picked up by the server. And the server came with the drink... And the comment, "Um... Yeah... I rang it in as a Rum and Coke, and she swears she poured a rum and Coke.... Try this, and see if it's better." Listen here, server girl.. I don't give a shit who did what, or why. And I'm not looking for a Congressional inquiry, either. I just care that we get what we order in a timely, and professional fashion.   When our food came, we ordered 2 Growlers of Pumpkin Porter. The server says, "Um.... Did you want me to get those NOW???? Or....??? Like, I can wait until you're ready to leave." I was thinking, we've tried this whole "waiting for you to do your job thing, and it's just not working out too well", but refrained from speaking it.   The Twin Peaks rejects are beginning to infiltrate my beloved Four Peaks. Blonde, snotty, sarcastic, and snide, lots of cleavage, and dumb as a bag of hammers.... Glad I went to a horse show following the experience. They (the horses) allowed me to reconnect with intelligence.

To dispell any myths, I am a REAL Yelper. I am not bought and paid for (Everyone has a price, and they can't afford me. No free margarita or cheese crisp will pay that fare.) I have not been solicited, or asked, or suggested to write my review.   The food REALLY is that good. And worthy of every 4 Star rating it has received (which BTW I never read, until I saw that someone spent many hours reporting all of those imposters). My GF had been there many times, and she suggested we go. I got there, and THEN read the 1.5 star rating. WTF? I make it a point to never go anywhere with less than a 3 Star rating. I suggested we leave. She said,  "let's stay. Last time I was here, it was good. Besides, Bo, could it be any worse than Macayo's on Cinco?"   Well played, good friend.   I was expecting shit rolled into a tortilla. I was expecting service on par with a 1.5 star dining expereince. And I waited. I was exceptionally critical of all aspects of the expereince. PLEASE GIVE ME A REASON TO PROVE EVERYONE ELSE RIGHT, DAMN YOU!!! AND BOY WAS I WRONG.  The service was EXCEPTIONAL. So much so that my GF said, "Don't you think it was 5 stars for a Mexican Food joint?" Well, GF, it's still my Yelp and I say 4.5 Stars for the expereince. And maybe it was, but when I left, I left delightfully full, contently happy, and feeling like I had a stellar expereince.   Maybe the loss of 1 Star had to do with me needing to stand up to tell a patron to shut the fuck up,  keep his voice down, and stop being an ugly, foul-mouthed American in front of my GF's 5 year old. But, that's not the restaurant's fault. That's the fault of an immature, small, insecure man behaving like a small, insecure, Ugly American.   Back to the topic at hand.... The service was awesome. Glasses refilled before hitting the E light. Chips full, until we asked for no mas! Food was SCORCHING hot, so you KNOW there was no wait time in the window.   The food was incredible. I kept thinking... Where have I had better Mexican Food? And the only place I can think of is in Albuquerque, and it's called El Pinto.  We ordered a cheese crip. It was how WE like Cheese Crisps. CRISPY. FLAKY. Breaking apart when you pick it up. Crunchy... Melted cheese oozing. That's how we like em. That's how we got it. Without being asked.    The 5 year old got a Taco. Al a Carte. PLEASE BE SCREWED UP SO THAT I CAN TELL EVERYONE HOW MUCH YOU SUCK!! No dice. She ordered the enchilata plate. They were almost better than what I ordered. And I ordered the Canitas burrito poco style. If we've met, I'm a big dude, and I can eat. A lot. I couldn't finish it. The beans were smooth, flavorful... And the rice... While I'm not a fan of Mexican/Spanish Rice, I tried it in an attempt to find SOMETHING wrong. I liked it. No enough that I wll eat it often, but I had more than a couple bites, and enjoyed the flavor.   The only thing that we could think about seeing the reviews here on Yelp is "HATERS GON' HATE." And the world is full of haters. It's already hard to find really good Mexican food in this town. Yelpers, don't hate on a good thing. We need each other to find little gems like this one.    The decor is nice. I did make the comment that it would be awesome w a bar and Happy Hour, but they are a small joint, in tight confines.   DEFINITELY WILL BE BACK. FREQUENTLY.

I really wish that we could rate something 4.5 stars....   Went back last night. Even better than before, because of a new discovery.  $3.75 MARGARITAS  No gimmicks, no shenanigans. Menu price.   The service was STILL excellent. Our server had a fun, witty sense of humor. The food was awesome. If there IS a gripe, it's that the food is too hot when it comes out. SCORCHING, so be careful!  These cheese crisps are THE BEST in town. If I could figure out how to make these at home, I'd be breaking fat person records. Best I leave this one to the pro's.    Since I'm continuing my quest to find something wrong with Don Ruben's, I tried something different on the menu, as did my gf. I did the Carne Asada tacos, she did the Spinach Enchiladas. Two plates full of AWESOME coming right up!   The low rating befuddles us, and the recent accusations of "imposter postings", or "shill postings" throws us off, so we talk about what WOULD make Don Ruben's a 5. We can't think of anything.   This is the best Mexican food in the Valley. There's a few others I'm obligated to try, (DAMMIT!) but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to get a fair comparison, and to bring an accurate review to my beloved Yelp.

Never in my life did I think I'd be eating breakfast at RSC at 7:30 on a Monday morning. And how I got there involves spinning a wild yarn about driving to Chinle, Arizona on the Navajo Indian Resevervation via Winslow, Joesph City, and Holbrook that started at 1:30pm on Sunday afternoon. If you've never driven through "the res" at night, don't. It's terrifying. Honestly. Scared me to death. And I don't scare easily.  After waking up at 5:30am in Flagstaff, common sense says stop in Flag for a bite to eat before heading down the hill. Common sense failed us at 8pm the night before.   We got to Rock Springs, and I was expecting it to be busy. Hardly. 1 group of 4 eating breakfast. After perusing the menu, I was in that state between hungry, and "ready to vomit and drool all over myself". The server was nice enough, and the coffee was good enough to stave off the vomit and drooling.   I was hoping for pancakes, but since there was no real Maple Syrup, no dice. HFCS syrup is THE WORST. No aunt I've ever met would condone that. I settled on the Western Omlet. It came with "Country Potatoes", and toast. The "Country Potatoes" were the freezer stored, bag type, precut.... OMG, there's that vomit feeling again. Seriously. No honest to goodness home cookin country diner served me frozen anything. That's blasphemy, honestly. No hash browns, either. They were "out". How do you run "out" of Hash Browns? Get a potato, get a grater, and get to work! Coffee cake? No dice because they "didn't feel like making it today." I can't make this stuff up.   The eggs were so weakly average, that I left about a quarter of it uneaten. It was just flat, and bland.   And we paid $35 for the privilege. No thanks, Rock Springs.     About the fruit pies.... They're canned. The filling is the canned stuff that you can buy at the store. Crusts are flour, water, graham cracker. I've seen them make the pies, and my teeth hit the floor when I saw them pour canned filling into a crust. It was the generic, Shamrock/Sysco/Southwest Foods canned filling. I can't speak on the Pecan Pie, but the fruit pies are canned. Lemon Merangue, canned. Rave about them all you want, but know it's possible to make the same thing at home for a fraction of the cost. We had been buying pies here for the last 15 years on our way up to the cabin. The day I saw them pour that filling into their fruit pies, that was it. 15 years of loyal patronage, all gone.    I'm all done with Rock Springs. Pies and all.

Rule number 1, DO NOT make me choose between here, and Pho Tranh. Da Vang does things well (Spring Rolls, and Vermicelli) and Pho Tranh does Pho well. But, I LOVE the pho here, as well. And so, if queried, I'd tell you I like both Da Vang and Pho Tranh very much.   This is a HOLE IN THE WALL. Don't go, and then complain that it's a hole in the wall. You've read the reviews, and decided to go, and so it is; STILL, yes STILL, a hole in the wall.  Getting your water refilled sometimes requires you to get up and almost get it yourself. Tapping on the glass with a nearby chopstick works too, if you're feeling rude, as I have once or twice.   My 3 stand-bys are the 37B, Vermicelli with BBQ pork and I get the shrimp whole. Ground shrimp, no thanks. I love the lemon grass beef, and the pho. The Spring rolls are awesome, as well. Flu season would have REALLY REALLY sucked without the pho from Da Vang.    In conclusion, the service is very hit and miss. Get you own water, if necessary. The food is 4 star, in my opinion. And that makes up for the iffy service.

Stopped in amid the hustle and bustle of a restaurant under a large remodel. No worries here. I like the look of the new decor. The booths are roomie and comfy, the tables appear a little bigger and the interior seems brighter.   My gf ordered the Turkey Benedict. She thought it was "great". It was perfectly spicy, and the Hollandaise was very good.  I had the Huevos Rancheros. I have had it twice before, and it is consistently good. It could be a tad hotter, or spiced up, but I like my food hot. Like 10 out of 10 hot. Not much a gripe, just a preference.  Service was great. Server was fun, friendly, and efficient.   We always have a good experience at The Breakfast Club.

When you sit around and have a debate about whether or not this was the worst Mexican food you've ever had, well, that exemplifies what kind of experience this was.  We went on Cinco de Mayo, and were in somewhat of a hurry as we had other obligations to attend to. I thought that at 5pm, we could slip in, grab a table in the bar, grab food and beverage and get on our way.  To be quick, and to the point, the service was good, but the food was absolutely garbage. Bland, flat, uninspired...   Between the purple power rangers (Pro-Tem Rent-a-Cop), the 20 year old manager, and the horrific food, I'll go out of my way to not go here again.

Native Phoenician here. Have been eating at the Tee-Pee for as long as I can remember. One thing that very poignantly stands out is coming back to the Tee-Pee after coming back after living somewhere else for several years. What stands out is the memories of the food. When I left it was good, when I got back it was terrible.   The quality of the food has slid slowly into ho-hum-dom, and then further into what am I paying for? If you've read my profile, you'll notice that I'm HUGE on value. Does what you are getting measure up to what you are paying for? If I know I'm getting 5 Star food and service, I'll pay for it.   It just seems that things at the Tee-Pee have started to change from really being interested in putting out great food for a great price, to playing off the hype that has become the Arcadia neighborhood hotspot places.   It's most disappointing that what was once a favorite hangout, has left me finding other places to get good mexi-chow.

Hands down THE BEST coffee in town. Lisa, the owner, (the coolest chick in Scottsdale) is committed to putting out the best, and most diverse selection of coffee from around the world, and is truly passionate about her work. She can tell you about every coffee she has in her store, including the notes, flavors, nuances, etc. What more can you ask for?   I'll tell you. Free wi-fi? They have it. Comfy chairs? Got those too. Displays of local artists selling their photography, and art on the wall? Yep. And she picks legitimately talented artists to display in her shop.  Also, for those of us really addicted to her coffee, she'll mail you coffee to WHEREVER you may be, FPO/APO addresses included. Good coffee is a must even in inhospitable environments. ;)   Thanks Lisa for giving me the greatest cup of coffee ever!

Went late last night with the family after a long day. Wanted to try The Grind, but they close at 9:30. Next up; Delux.  Went in, got seated promptly. Service was excellent. Ordered a Delux burger, and 2 Chinese Chicken Salads. $9.5, and $9 respectively. 1 beer, 2 glasses of wine, and two Ketels and Soda. The basket of mixed fries; get ready for it.... $6. Are you effing serious? Grand total, $77. Tip and total $83. (edit: my numbers were off, and it was brought to my attn that the tip sucked... so it was closer to $87 or 88.. we did leave a fair tip because the service was good.)  Value. It sucked. 6 bucks for a basket of mixed fries; it had better come with a blow-job. The bread on the burger was a little firm. Not saying stale, but a little firm. The burger was cooked right, but it just missed something. The salads were good, but not great. Just a ho-hum meal.   Great selection of beers on tap, and a great bar. Great service, too, but the food left too much on the plate to be taken seriously as a $100 burger joint.   For almost $100 you should leave with a big smile on your face, not holding your ass like someone just raped you.    Gotta say... It was entertaining watching a girl make out with two different guys at the same time. (+1 star) The whole group was snowed out of their minds. (-1 star) Think she put that in the, "things I did last night that I do not remember" category? Eh, maybe. But, it was a little awkward sitting with my family while watching the sexcapade.   So, the lesson here boys and girls is, when it's the only late-night game in town, you can charge whatever you want.

I have been to Mamma Mia's on two consecutive days. Day 1, I ordered two slices of pie with sausage and meatball on them. Add small drink, pay CHEAP fare, and enjoy this blissful ride to pizza heaven. Awesome pizza. Reminds me of pie from the NYC in many ways. The menu is huge, with many choices for the pickiest of eaters. If you can't find an item on the menu you should probably live where you really are not allowed to make decisions. North Korea comes to mind... Anyways, I digress.  Day 2 went in and ordered the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The last time I had a parmi was on the Jersey Shore sometime in my wild and mindless youth. But, the one thing I do remember of my wild and mindless youth was those days on The Shore eating Parmis. Today, nostalgia came and-a hit me RIGHT-a in the face-a. These were AWESOME. And so that you know that I am not biased; my friend ordered one, and said it was "Absolutely amazing." So there.  Ok, so why then the 4 stars you may be asking? Well, 2 things.  1. It's 113 degrees outside today in Phoenix. When you stand in a restaurant and debate whether it would be better to stay inside, eat outside, or take it home, you know it's too fricking hot inside. We decided that the "to go" option was too good to pass up. Inside, it's ABOUT 10-12 degrees cooler than outside.  2. I'm not entirely exaggerating when I say that the front of this place is not much bigger than a broom closet. A small family will fill the space inside rendering it useless. The chairs are all canted in a weird angle rendering 3/4 of them useless. The lesson here folks: Take it home, to the office, or wherever you spend your days and nights. Just go away. Or.... wait until January to eat outside.   It's a hit in my book, though.

If you're familiar with aviation, you'll be familiar with braking action. For this place I give a "poor" braking action report. I just got back from going here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was busy, but not overly so. We were asked if we'd like a seat next to the pond, and decided that a 4 year old would enjoy the view of the turtles wading gently in the pond, and the ducks doing anything possible to avoid the scorching sun committed to frying their little brains after prolonged exposure.  What was not anticipated, however, was the flys. Are you kidding me? I should not be sitting in a restaurant where I'm about to shell out $50 for lunch and have the pleasure of swatting flys while eating. Iraq? Sure. Afghanistan? Definitely. Mexico? Comes with the turf. North Scottsdale/Cave Creek/ Carefree? WTF.... over?   Also not anticipated was the service. There seems to be a conflict between me and my mate on this one. She goes with "average", I go with "tardy". She's thinking I'm being "harsh". I'm  thinking I'm being fair. That said, I just think that the server was borderline lazy. Asked for the water carafe to be refilled, and someone else ended up bringing it sevvvvvveral minutes later, while the water station was literally across from our table. Asked for our salsa to be refilled, he looked at it, acknowledged and walked away. I made a "bet" that he would forget. I was not let down. Winner winner chicken dinner. But not quite the win I had in mind. This went on with bussing, refills, etc. He seemed just a bit "behind the situation", had poor SA, and was not interested in performing at a high level.   The food was eh. Well. My food was eh. I got the enchilada plate, she ordered the pollo fundito. I liked the fundito. It is Ajo Al's Pollo Con Queso in disguise. It is good, but if faced with Al's or El Encanto, I'll go with Al's every time. The beans were a little heavy on the lard. Like I said, it was just sort of bland-ish all the way around.   Understand, if I were going to Filiberto's, this would be more than adequate food. However, we paid $47 for lunch and dollar for dollar, it sucked.

I've been here on 2 occasions. Once for dinner, and once for lunch. Both times have been good, quality experiences.  When we had dinner at Tagliani's it was 4 of us. I was with my family, and my brother in law raved about it. We ordered 2 appetizers, and each of us ordered an entree. We family styled the entrees and everyone ate some of everything. All of it was very good. Bread was fresh and warm.  Put it in the the "Must do again" category.  Went back for lunch a few days ago. Went to check-in, and low and behold, a free app! Wings and Rings! And honestly, they were the best wings I've ever had. Grilled to absolute perfection. The rings were homemade. Awesome.   I had the lunch special baked ziti. Very good.   Gf had the Eggpant Parmesian. She gave it a 3.5. I tried the spaghetti and maranara that went with it. I thought it had a very clean, and fresh flavor. Great for a maranara.  Little one had the pepperoni pizza off of the Kids' Menu. I had a couple of bites to try it, and I thought it was excellent. I'd have eaten it.  The only gripe was the bread seemed a tad dated. But, it was 3pm when we got there, and I'm sure fresh bread might be a stretch.   Overall, it was an excellent experience with great food, and good service.

Went to Bravi today for a late lunch. It was a less than thrilling experience. We went because it was close, and it was in the neighborhood. Upon entering, we were the only people in the place. By we, I mean, me and one other person. This was not a herd, or gaggle, school, party, or group by any means.   I ordered the sausage/meatball penne pasta, with fettuccine substituted for the penne, and with a "rose'" sauce (excuse me, miss counter helper girl, but I've never heard of it called that, as you said it to me in a condescending, snotty tone.) I also added a Caeser salad, and drink to go along with it. The other person in my party (one, only one) ordered the large Caesar salad.   The salads were brought first. They were ok, but a tad heavy with the dressing on both. If you've ever had a Caesar struggling to come up for air due to drowning in dressing, you'll know that too much garlic and anchovy simultaneously can spoil any occasion. Do I sound condescending in stating that the lettuce WAS crisp?   Here's where things started to go downhill; As we were the only two people in the restaurant, it was painfully hard to miss my dish of pasta sitting in the window after being cooked. It was also painfully hard to miss said counter helper girl chatting with the newly arrived co-worker as my food sat idly and feeling well neglected. A rescue party was organized, and my food was salvaged out of the window.   Upon inspection, I observed that this dish, too, was drowning in a sea of liquid. After two bites of the Sea of Rose', I'd decided that I was not wanting to swim in sauce today, and sent it back. My sad fettuccine came back STILL drowning in sauce. I'd decided that attempting to get something done right a third time was going to be a pointless endeavor, and decided it best to suck it up, and eat my food, less someone return it with a loogie in it.   Here's the kicker of the whole thing; about half-way through my new dish of un-fixed pasta, counter helper girl came to the table, and in her precious little snotty, snide tone said, "Next time, when you order pasta, you might want to tell them you want LIGHT sauce." I couldn't help but to have a plethora of snide, snotty remarks to return her way, but for whatever reason, refrained.   Barely a 2. Only because of the interior decor. Maybe the garlic bread and crisp lettuce too. Maybe. But, the service sucked, and that girl with her snide, snotty, pretentious attitude left a whole lot to be desired.

Here is my update: I just received this incredible message from the "counter-helper girl".... After all this time, she sends this. Bitter much?   Gofuck Y. Block User  One minute ago "I am said 'counter helper girl' in one of your postings.  I was not trying to be snide or snotty, but simply help you with ordering for your next visit because I know how our food comes, always loaded with sauce.  But thank goodness, you most likely won't be returning.  And since you know so much about food and restaurants, I would think you'd know that the hour you came in at, is generally the slow part of the day in ANY RESTAURANT YOU VISIT.  I actually really do apologize that I came off snotty and snide, and that I was not prompt with your order, but you could have just been sincerely upfront and honest about your meal and I would have given you a free meal or two.  Instead of acting like a pretentious jerk to me while your fat girlfriend with fake hair threw daggers at me with her eyes and spending so much time blasting me on the internet.  And I'm sorry, how on earth could a 'counter helper girl' be at all pretentious by any means...  You were just rude, and it was unnecessary."   Let's address, shall we? This email shows that you're a nasty, bitter, insecure bitch. Check. We most likely WILL be returning, but only to show your boss, and the owners this lovely email. Check. You have no idea how much I know about food & restaurants, because you don't know me, but run some quick math. I'm 35. I started working in the restaurant industry at 14. That's 21 years. Probably longer than you've been alive, girly.   Been sincerely upfront? When? While you were talking shit with your co-worker? Right. I'll get right on it.   Need I even address the "fat" comment? She's 6 feet tall and an athlete. Sorry she doesn't look in the mirror in disgust and need to go vomit herself into a positive self-image. Fake hair? Jealous much? It's real. As are her tits. That you need to talk about her physical looks to make a point about your shitty service reflects much about the way that you see yourself. Let me guess; you think you're fat, and hate what you see when you look in the mirror. She does not. Check.  As far as those little daggers that you felt... It's because you suck at doing your job. You're there to work, not socialize with your besties. I watched as my food sat in the window for minutes with nobody paying any attention to it, to the tune of me needing to physically get up out of my seat to bring it to your attention. THAT is unacceptable service. It's shocking to us that there could literally be 3-5 people in the restaurant and food still sat in the window for a prolonged period of time. Again, unsat and unacceptable. Serving food that you admittedly say is loaded with sauce is "your thing", but to remake it exactly the same way shows a lack of attention to the customer.    Enjoy your job while you still have it, and I'll be seeing you soon. Check and checkmate.  **I want to offer my sincere THANK YOU for validating everything that I stated in my review of you, and the restaurant.**

A few months ago, I had a pleasant meeting with the sales manager at a local Einstein's. Being that I had just moved from San Diego, and had started riding again, I was looking for a new bike shop. Surely there are none as GREAT as Adam's Ave. in San Diego, and so far, I continue to believe this.  I went in to investigate the store, and upon cursory glance noticed a $30 Specialized bike pump being sold for $70. Hmmmm. Interesting.   I went out for a ride last week, and, in my youthful exuberance, forgot my water bottles. I know! WHO DOES THAT!? Along the route was Bicycle Haus. I had a few meager dollars in my kit, and was in need. Surely they would help a fellow cyclist out. I entered, and I did so, feeling like I was getting stabbed by eyeballs. A better term: eye fucked.  "Who is this enemy intruder, sporting different colors, and wearing a foreign kit?"  "Details.", I thought as I stated my case for two water bottles. After being sized up, the guy behind the counter pointed nonchalantly, and said, "Over there."  After grabbing two bottles, I reached into my kit, and told him I was unsure if I had the $12 and change he requested. I asked if I could bring in the $1.50 or so I may have been short, upon completion of my ride.  He says, "I'm sorry, you're going to need to leave one of the bottles behind if you can't pay for both." OVER A DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS?!  Turns out, I had $13 in cold hard American currency to pay the man. But it left a really bad taste in my mouth.   I live on the road that the BH crowd frequents on their way to get their LGO caffeine fix. I find them to be a generally unfriendly, pompous, and arrogant  lot. No wave, no smile and nod, no common cycling courtesies. When seen at LGO, they do the same.  I was passing this story along to a guy that I ride with, and he said that they do group rides on Monday and Wednesdays. My days might be off, so forgive me. His personal experiences ring like mine, however he passed one on that left me convinced of the depth of douchebaggery owned by these guys.   Picture if you will: Group ride winding down. They get to their destination, and one rider develops a slow leak, which by the conclusion of post-ride hanging out has gone flat. He goes to his trusty steed, and finds a hoof gone wrong. Upon asking fellow riders for assistance (tube and Co2), they shrug shoulders and leave. Trusty steed and rider hobbled, he is forced to walk home 1.5 miles, with hobbled steed in tow. Inappropriate. Grossly, and wildly inappropriate.   Get it together, guys. Most definitely NOT what the owner had in mind for his store.   ***UPDATE***: While at breakfast this morning, I had the honor of being enlightened with a story from a friend about the Bicycle Haus. We were talking about my posting, and she said that she had been asked TO NOT COME BACK to BH because she "does not buy enough stuff" at BH. She is a mountain biker, and was coming in regularly to get service done on her mountain bike. Along with her service stop, she would pick up some post ride bars, and whatnots, and drop her bike, and go. Seems as though they did not take kindly to her "quickies" and asked her to stop coming in, all together. And now one of the service guys calls to ask her come to come back in?? Seriously?    And so, I was left thinking to myself, "That figures." when I heard of these shenanigans. They can have em, cuz we don't want em!   But, hey, if the "coolest, sexiest, hippest" poser shit, some nose high attitude self-absorbed, pompous people, and bad service are what you're after, than it sounds like this is YOUR place! BUT... If you're an established, legitimate cyclist, and you look for inconsequential things like good service, competent wrenches, good vibes, good peeps, a smile, an appreciative owner who is thankful for your patronage, and and fun group of people who frequent the shop than you just might want to search elsewhere. I would suggest Adam's Avenue, but maybe I'm the only one willing to pack all of my bikes and drive them to San Diego.  ***Update #2*** I have never received "hate mail" for a post, until I did from a dude named Robert who said that I was a "douchebag, wanna-be asshole" for writing the review I wrote on BH.  Who would think I could irk someone SO MUCH just by expressing my opinion? Love you, Robert. ;)  It would be of no loss if this place did not survive the economy.  And so, now it just complicated because: Of course, this is just OUR opinion, WE could be wrong.

I think after being here numerous times, I should write a review. I am a fan, so the 4 Stars are apropos. My gf's 5 year old loves this place, and will ask to go everytime upon passing it. Let's face it, the Chinese buffet options in Phoenix suck, which is really unfortunate. I think the collective angst about this is being taken out on all of the Chinese buffets of the valley. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.   For what it is, a chinese buffet in Phoenix, this is quality. This is the better Chinese buffet in Surprise. The other one is good too, but not great, just like this place.    Here's what I've come to expect from this place. The service is always great. The servers are friendly, and affable. But, the food is ALWAYS hit and miss. Something may be good one visit, and dull and flat on another. The fried rice, and lo mein are great examples. The rice may be great on one visit, oily, sort of greasy, and full of gristle the next. Seems like things lean towards "greasy" if they're not good.   I deplore the TV set to CNN, or whatever other news station they decide to put on. I'll go out of my way to not have to sit under, or near that thing.   We'll alternate between the 2, I'm sure, but until something significantly changes at the other place, we'll continue to dine here.

I used to LOVE Zipps. Great Happy Hour, fun energy and awesome Zipparitas. I could get a full meal on Happy Hour prices. Not. Too. Shabby. Now? ....  Went in on a Tuesday evening. Got there at 6:50. Waited for 7 minutes to get seated in a 1/4 full restaurant. Took 5 more minutes for server to greet us. Said to the server,  "We arrived at 6:50, and here we are at 7:05, could you honor Happy Hour prices?"  "Sorry, no we can't."  "Could you ask your manager?"  "Sure. I guess." And off she went.  Several minutes later she returned. "Um. Yeah. I talked to my manager and he said no. I'm sorry." And off she went. We placed drink orders, and food orders.   What in the ever loving hell happened to the burgers?! I remember them being awesome. I ordered the Black & Blue. It looked like Wimpy's burger of Popeye fame. Slathered with blue cheese came two very small pieces of beef on a bun. That was it. The salad had brown leaves in it.  The sum total of the Happy Hour pricing was $10. But the poor taste in my mouth from the experience was much greater.   Sending this review and a letter to the office, and let's see what happens.

This is a COMPLETELY different experience than the Carolina's on 91st Ave and Peoria store. This location is clean, well-kept, looks new, and has a good vibe inside of it. The food was even better here. Everything at this location seems to be on a higher level.   I wanted to get Huevos Rancheros, and it's not on the menu. Isn't this blasphemy? I would say so. Settled on the Enchilada, Tostada, Taco combo. Delish.   Everyone has raved about the tortillas, and they really are all of that, and then some.   This is THE place in town to get quality FAST Mexican food. Worth the little detour from the Bertos brothers.

This is an accumulative review. Based on 50 years of dining hell at Filiberto's. Not really 50, but with the amount of internal distress and subsequent can time I've put in due to this place it sure feels that way.  My worst experience: Picture if you will; driving to Cali for a fun-filled week at the beach and cool ocean waves. We stopped for gas, and decided that some Fili's would be a good idea. False. My gf does not eat beef or pork. She ordered a Chicken quesadilla. Got an intestine filled quesadilla. She took two bites and had the look of complete and total disgust. She opened the quesadilla, I head an audible stomach turn, and the words, "WHAT.THE.FUCK." come from her mouth. I looked at the quesadilla sitting in her lap, and cringed as I debated whether to tell her what it was, or not. She asks, "What is it?" I said, "You don't want to know." as I removed it from her lap and jettisoned it out of the window driving down the 60 out of Wickenburg. She insisted on knowing, and I told her that it was pig intestine.    Then it was my turn. I took a bite of my Adobado burrito while she took a bite of the quesadilla. I then opened my burrito and found more pig intestine. Jettisoned the burrito, also. Glad we could help out the coyotes of Arizona. Still craving Mexican, we were forced to wait until Indio.   Went to the website to leave a review, and it didn't work. Called the office to get an email address and you would think I was trying to contact The President. Told she was "Vacationing in California." ME TOO! They have email, in California, also, FYI. Wrote an email to the owner and no response.   There really is no "best" experience at Filly's. Just not going to ever happen. Or maybe I'm jaded after that one.

More of the same... What ever has happened to America? We don't even need to talk about the price. Assinine. What a bunch of crap. This is Las Vegas is falling on deaf ears here.  The food was horrific. I have never in my life had such horrifically bland eggs. We both ordered omelettes.  How one can screw up a ham and cheese omelette is beyond me. I never thought it was possible until I ate here.   I am done with this one. The food was absolute shit. I don't eat at McDonald's. Haven't in 16 years. I will go there before I eat the shit this place produces.

Is there a better meal than breakfast? I think not... Any so, we have sort of made it a weekly tradition to have breakfast at The Place. My better half had eaten there prior to it moving to its new location, and I had never been there. She WAS NOT a fan of the previous location.   After looking at Yelp and the 4 stars reviews, I talked her into trying it again. And we are HUGE fans!   It starts with Mimosas and from there, it's breakfast bliss. The portions are HUGE, and the servers are friendly. Good food, but no real maple syrup. So, we bring our own.   It's a good experience.

After paying $10 for a footlong Tuna and a drink at Subway (read the review), I was obligated to find new lunchtime stomping grounds. And I've found one.   How someone is going to take points for "ambiance" in a Chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. But, you're not going to a Chicgo style gyro eatery for "ambiance". You're going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is.   The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite, and stare. Bite, and stare.   And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent, tasty meat. I'm not a tomato fan, so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth, I'd be looking at the food I had just started to chew, but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma, I tell you. Bite, and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm....   I was there at 11:30 on a Thursday, and it was less than crowded. Parking was no issue.   All of this for less than $7. Yep. I'll take my $3, and give it to the bum on the street. Better than spent at Subway.

I don't know how I've never stopped into this place, as I have spent years around the Arcadia neighborhood. I guess it's a good thing, because greatness is often overlooked when one is not prepared to see, or find greatness. This place is GREAT. I've spent the better part of 5 years looking for a gyro that takes me back to Santorini, and the other beautiful places in Greece. I ordered a gyro, and when eating Greek, always get a little bit of falafel.   The gyro was exquisite. When I got to Z's, I was still reading reviews from other Yelpers on this place, and fully intended to continue reading. i couldn't put the gyro down. The sauce in the gyro was perfection. It was stuffed full of meat. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, and the onions looked like they had just been cut. And that sauce. It would find its place in my heart faster than any ranch dressing ever could.   The falafel was dynamic. Tons of robust, distinguishable flavors overtook my mouth. Not all at the same time, but on their own time throughout the bite. Toasty nutlike flavor, with the smoothness of the chickpea, and then the bang of the coriander, finishing with the subtle notes of the other herbs, and more toasted fried flavors. Unreal.   The service is incredible. My gyro was on the table at the same time as I sat down after filling my beverage cup. They are friendly, gracious, and love making great food. The restaurant is also impeccably clean.  I will be be back regularly, and frequently.

They won me over. I may be the only person on planet Earth that does not like the Chilaquiles. But I ordered them, and didn't like them. The owner, Brad, came to the table, simply said, "Different strokes for different folks. What else can I get you?" And the new order was promptly served.   AWESOME, people!  My 1st visit, when it was at the old location, was uninspiring. I was just not all that impressed. After giving it a 2nd try, I'm glad that I did. And since then, I've made a 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th subsequent visit. All of them equally pleasant and enjoyable.  I do need to say that there is a hostess who is unable to modulate her voice, and when she calls people to their tables, renders all people within 10 feet deaf. And... When she called my name, she called the wrong name because she wasn't paying attention. After being yelled at 3 times asking me "Are you Joe? Are you Joe?" I waded my way through the noise, looked at the list, and politely informed her, "That doesn't say Joe." and smiled. What's the deal with that, you may be asking? The 45 minute wait would have been longer had I not been paying attention.  That said, a must go. I'm a fan of Brad's and his staff, and service first, and the food second.

We like Lucky's. We like Lucky's because the family that owns it is great. They are friendly, customer service oriented and work at producing great food for a good price. We have used Lucky's as our go to pizza shop for the past year. We have tried a lot of different pizzas on the menu, and have had the Chicken Parmi sandwiches. Excellent. Having had pizza all over the U.S., I can say that I am content with having used Lucky's as our only pizza shop for the past year.   Large pie, large wings, usually about $25 and we're set for the night. 2 pies, one with everything on it, an additional 1 topping pie, and 25 wings will usually run us about $38. We get smoking hot pie that tastes great, and leaves us with a smile on our faces. What more could you want?  When I mentioned customer service, we had an experience that allowed us to drive BACK to Lucky's from Wittmann. We ordered 2 pies. Upon arrival back at the house, SOMMMMMMEONE "forgot" there was a pie on the back seat. Upon opening the car door, Someone watched a large pizza tumble from the back seat, out of the box, sliding down and along the back seat, down the door frame, and onto the ground. Dirt pizza anyone? Nope. A quick call had a new pie ready to go in 20 minutes, faster than it took Someone to drive down to atone for their sins.   Why the review now? Because I've read about Ray's and we've decided to try it tonight. A review WILL be written.

I had been here on one previous occasion. As much as like spending my time with the geriatrics of Sun City, I've found I need to venture further outside of Surprise to find the X/Y generation. So, I did. For Happy Hour. After spending time with with good peeps, 4 street tacos, and Two Exes (the beer, silly. Two exes at the same time? Not me.) I had claimed Salty Seniorita safe, and acceptable. Naomi, our server, was great, too.  Stop the show. I had a lapse in judgement. I'm sorry. I went back with my gf on St. Patty's day. Well, night actually. It was windy, and stormy. Cool change of weather. Our server was attentive and nice. Can you tell I'm holding out? I'm refraining from going on about how bad the food was. But I cannot help it now. The chips and salsa are so bland and plain. The salsa is like hot watery cilantro puree. Flat, bland, and uninspiring. And... they charge you $2 for the pleasure. Are you kidding me?   My gf ordered the taco salad with BLACKENED Mahi. The fish came out under cooked and mushy. Not even an attempt at the blackened part of the equation. The salad was a heap of shit. Just a pile of stuff thrown haphazardly into a shell, that was food colored green. Maybe it was a spinach taco shell, but it looked like a food colored taco shell.   I ordered the fajitas. I pulled SEVERAL large chunks of gristly meat out of the plate. The shrimp was poorly packaged, over frozen, overcooked, and tasted flat and bland. That was after I had picked through the onions. Also, someone may want to put an APB out on the Bell Pepper. Large, green, red, or orange type pepper found in fajitas and other dishes. Mine had escaped. Yes. really. No bell peppers in my fajitas. The beans were canned Rosarita beans. Same bland garbage that can be bought in a store. Black beans, canned as well.   So why the 2 stars? The drinks were good. They have a margarita that is fresh squeezed and made from scratch that is awesome. The mango marg is great, my gf liked the Prickly Pear marg, and the house marg is not bad. Service was good too.   If they got the food on par with the service and the drinks, this would be THE place to go in the West Valley.

Am I obligated to write a decent review for a place that puts Kraft Macaroni & Cheese on the menu?   Terrible reviews made me skeptical about the food, Kraft on the menu made me pissed off. Had 2 beers, instead.   Get a quality chef in that joint for fuck's sake. What a shame...

I am writing this from the perspective of being a photographer.   This is the first time that I have been to the Preserve after reading, and hearing so much about it. I found it to be quite disappointing.   The issues with the Preserve, again, only from a bird spotting, and photography standpoint are many.  1. The area is completely overgrown. It has limited the view of all of the ponds and removed the vast majority of quality shooting locations. Beyond that, walking along the paths is ridiculous. I was walking along ponds, I should have been able to see, completely obstructed by shrubs and trees.  To define a quality shooting location; an area one can sit in, with a 180 degree view of the pond or the subject in front of the person.  There were trees that had 1/3 of its trunk covered in debris. I sat and watched birds, rats, and rabbits emerge from the debris.   This overgrowth is both unsightly, and a fire hazard.   2. The majority of the benches and blinds have been rendered unusable. Again, it comes down to the area being overgrown.  I walked past several benches that were placed on the edge of the pond, yet a view of dense shrubbery was presented. The blinds in the special use areas are shrouded and covered. What's the point of having a permit to use an area that has no unobstructed view?   3. Varmints. There are rabbits EVERYWHERE. Yes, they're cute, but rabbits bring rats, and there were a ton of those too. This is a disease outbreak waiting for a place to happen.  I went today looking for Burrowing Owls. All gone. Why? Cats. Feral cats have preyed on all of the Burrowing Owls, and they have been removed.   4. The ponds are inconsistently watered. This has made the birds leave for other locations.   I am incredibly displeased that I went today. I can go to a golf course and see the same birds with far less hassle, and can get great shots. It's unfortunate that the staff of this preserve isn't committed to making this a pristine bird area.

CLOSED. Where's a NO STAR rating when you need one.   It's too bad they got the boot. The food was great. Service blew, but the food was fantastic. I feel badly for all of the people who paid for wine "memberships". In a time where every dollar counts, there's nothing quite like having it taken from you.

Went for the Machida - Jones fight on 12/10. The line-up card was awesome. If the service was as good as the fight card, we would have dropped a 20 on her. Unfortunately it was not. She came out of the gate like a Thoroughbred, and finished like a Donkey.   Our server came to the table a total 4 times without asking us if we needed anything. (We shared a table with a couple of others due to the crowding of the place.) If ever there was an opportunity to make money for a server, this is one of those nights.  However, water glasses remained empty, even though our server was at the table 4 times to the tune that I needed to ask a different server for more water. I was prepared to drink several beers during the fight, but due to the hassle decided that drinking beer at home would be easier.   The toughest part was watching this server stand at the hostess stand and bullshit with her co-workers during the majority of our time there. Her lack of attention had nothing to do with the place being packed, and working her ass off. She had decided that it was more important to bullshit with her co-workers.   As the fight was winding down, my gf and I were sitting at the table talking, and I noticed our server staring at us. AWKWARD. I almost wanted to tell her to go away, but instead, removed the tip that I felt almost obligated to leave. And shortly after, we left.   Let's talk about the check.... $32 for 2 beers, and 24 boneless wings. Yeah. Sticker shock. Shitty service, and overpriced food.  I don't stiff servers often, if ever before... But tonight, I did. I admit it. Call me a douche. I've just made the decision that I refuse to put up with shitty service from people who feel entitled to make money for no effort. If we're talking about entitlement,  I am now entitled to tip a shitty server nothing if I deem it appropriate.   What a horrendous dining and service experience.

How is it that we find ourselves in Scottsdale so often? Ugh. But, when you have an opportunity to partake in some lunch with a bestie....   We had heard that Brio was really good, and it did not disappoint. The hostess at the front was nice, sweet, and had a great sense of humor. We were seated promptly, and ordered Arnold Palmers and water for 3 as we waited for our 3rd. The lemonade is fresh squeezed and made in house. Honestly, the AP's were BOMB!  I ordered the Chef's Special pasta, which had bacon (MMMMM BAAACON!) and carmelized onions in it. It was good, but the Lobster Bisque I ordered before my entree showed up was exquisite.  GF ordered a breaded chicken salad, which I had a couple of bites of, and I thought it was great too.   Service was top notch, and the price was fair. All together a great experience.   I love the interior decor, as well. It is well lit from above, but not too bright from the sides. The lights are super cool also.   Looking forward to going back for Happy Hour.

I sent this letter to the Feedback page of CobbleStone.   Sorry for the poor feedback, but I felt it needed to be done here, as well as Yelp. I've been coming (going?) to CobbleStone for over a year. The guys at the front are always exceptional. The clerks inside are always courteous, polite, and helpful.   The car wash experience has been an absolute crapshoot as of late. I purchase The Works wash everytime I go in. On all 3 of my vehicles.   I bugdget around $100 a month in washes. I live in a remote, rural area where dust is prevalent, but need to maintain a clean car for business in town. It can be quite a challenge.  Today I went in and had the car washed. When I opened the cupholder, there was still trash in it. I asked the manager about the trash, and he said it would be an upcharge to remove the wrappers out of the cupholder. You've GOT to be kidding me. The interior looked like it was rushed through, and I feel that the quality was not on par with what I paid for.  Iam writing to ask that this problem is remedied, as I would prefer not to have to take my business to Danny's, all things being honest.   Kind Regards.

Today, I had the distinct dis-pleasure of paying $9.55 for a 12" Tuna, on Wheat, with a drink. I like tuna. And I like drinks. But I don't like paying $10 for a fast food sandwich. I've sorta been looking for a better place to grab lunch while I am at flight school, and this may be just the real legitimate reason I have been looking for.   Then.... In my irritation, I try to find a price list for the sandwiches, and the pages are removed from the site. I stumbled upon the nutritional info for the sandwiches, and discovered that while none of the sandwiches are particularly "healthy", the Tuna sandwich is right up there in the mix for the worst. How do you screw up a tuna fish sandwich and make it unhealthy? Tuna, mayo, cheese, and bread. That's it...  Drown it in mayo. That would be my answer.

Why is it that every time I go into this joint, it's like Amateur Hour at The Apollo? I am so over going into joints, and leaving feeling like I was taken in a weird slight of hand game.   This place is so over-rated. How does one order off of the Happy Hour menu, and leave with a $70 bill. For 2.5? Me, GF, and 5 yr old.   We went here for a great fun time with cool peeps, and were there 2 hours. Wing Tuesday is really not that good of a deal, and the Happy Hour beers are junk.   Sorry for the rant, but, Buffalo Wild Wings, I am over you, and we need to end our tepid relationship.

I have a much known and publicized dislike for Scottsdale and those who reside in it. Especially the 30-something single crowd.... So why then, you may ask would I go to a place in the heart of that douchebaggery? To meet my best friend for a beer late afternoon, Happy Hour style.   What I encountered at this place was awesomely refreshing. So much so that I probably should not be writing a review on how great this place is, lest it become a "cool trendy" place to be. Great for the owners, I know, but terrible for real, in touch, sensible human beings.   Let's talk about the owners... They are local. And a family. REALLY? A family owned and operated joint in Scottsdale? Shhhhh! Don't tell anyone!  Something that that sets them apart is their home-made daily dessert. Our servers (I'll get to them in a moment; be still my beating heart...) kept talking about this brownie with this lost, googly-eyed in love look. Of course we had to indulge. And we did... In all 5000000000 calories of it's peanut-buttery chocolatey al a modey deliciousness. But we loved EVERY fat round belly inducing bite.  And so these servers... We had two of them. We started with Jennifer. And because we're just sooooo cool (not really. We're not very cool at all.), we ended up with Tiffany ANNNNNDDDD Jennifer. They rocked our little worlds. Beautiful, fun, friendly, outgoing, fun to joke with, awesome energies and attitudes, and did I mention beautiful?  This was a great experience for us after a long and challenging week. It's great to have a place to go where we have a great time and drink a couple of beers.  And they have buckets of peanuts too... Does it get any better?

Twin Peaks and Scottsdale were made for each other. After taking a much needed day off with a buddy, we decided to take in Happy Hour at Twin Peaks. I should have known better after being at The Yardhouse DR several months earlier, and seeing the opening team come in for a meeting before they opened. They all looked miserable, and the look of utter contempt on the blonde girl's face is something I'll remember forever.   I digress....  I was dressed in board shorts, t-shirt, and Rainbows. That's how I walked in. I saw a visible sneer on the hostess's face as she looked over my very comfortable, and very functional attire. Forgive me, girly, but before you condescend to my attire consider that I have worked 7 days a week for a year straight, and decided to take a day off at the pool. You're a hostess, not the fashion police.   That sort of set the tone for the place.  We got seated, and it just sort of felt like being in a strip club. Most of the servers look like they hate their lives, and aren't having fun, the manager looks like a sleazebag, and the girls are just there to get tips. The girls' make-up looks like spackle applied with a knockdown knife. And they use fake names. Our server was flat (personality wise, anyways), dry, boring, and pretentious. Honestly, while I love to mess with pretentious snotty servers, I had been at the pool all day, was quite sunburned, and just wanted some cold beers, a little food, and a friendly server.     When I asked what beers they had on tap, she acted like I asked her the formula for the circumference of a circle. I had to get up to go look at the beer selection. And... It's not printed on a menu anywhere. Happy Hour menu is $1 off the beer. Yep. That's it.   So we ordered the BBQ nachos. And two beers. I like cold beer, but when it turns into a beer slushy, I'm not so hip on cold beer. She said the nachos were one of the best things on the menu. REALLY? Ummmmmm. Ok.    This place is a bust. See what I did there? Great big boobies. Great big attitudes. And very little substance. If you're 22, and think you can go hit on a server and score, this is the place to test your game. If you score, you GOTTA post it. I'll bow down at your Alter of Game. If you like good food, good service, and a quality Happy Hour, I can recommend about 5 other places for you. Tilted Kilt is better than this place by a large measure. Four Peaks, a local brewery, would be another solid pick.

We went here on a Thursday night. It was busy in both the bar and the dining room. The service was attentive, but the food was terrible. The water, too.  The water was absolutely disgusting. We know Phoenix's water is gross, but there is something extra specially disgusting in the water in that neighborhood. For a restaurant to serve water that bad leaves me speechless.   I started with a side salad. It was a bed of lettuce and some grated cheese. For $8, I expected more. Onion or tomato, maybe? A mushroom?   I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. I was completely perplexed by my dish. The first thing I noticed was that it looked like it had sat under the lamps too long. But we ordered it 5 or 6 minute prior. The dish was hot, but the top of the food was lukewarm. Under the film that had developed on the top of the lukewarm-ish-ness of the dish it was warm, but not hot. Again, it was perplexing. It looked like the Costco Chicken Parmesan was served on my plate, but it wasn't as good. It was bland, and flat, and had no flavor.   My gf ordered the Fish & Chips. She said that they were "mediocre". The fish was average, and bland. The breading was bland, and too greasy. Nothing at all like the Fish & Chips at Four Peaks. I had a bite of the Cole Slaw, and liked it, though.  My gf's son ordered the mini burgers from the Kids' Menu. When I looked at the burger, it looked like something was amiss. I opened the bun, and looked at the burger. The cheese looked like the burger had been cooled, and re-heated. It was gross. The burger was like a rock. Bland. Overcooked. No texture. No condiments with the burger. He's 6, but even he knows that a burger should have some condiments with it. He ate 2 bites, and gave me the, "Really? Do I have to eat this?" look.   The only reason this place is a 2 is because we were in a hurry, and they worked to accomodate our schedule. I wouldn't even call the service particularly "GOOD", it was good enough to get us in and out in a timely fashion.   A decent family restaurant in the West Valley still eludes us. It's a shame that there are so many lazy, uninspired, unmotivated chefs in the industry. Are they even Chefs at this level, or do the owners throw a hodge podge of illegals into the back and call it good?   We will not go back.

When I discovered Tom Yum, we were going on day 9 of being sick. I mean sick. You're not sick for 9 days with a cold. We got visited by all manner of evil Tom Yum was the shining beam of light in the darkness of night.   I stopped at Tom Yum for some take-out after stopping at WalMart for more cold/flu remedies. At this point, my smell and taste capabilities had diminished to well below 20%. Everything we were eating tasted bland. And we were looking for some relief. We got it at Tom Yum.   We love Satara, and that has been our go-to place for Thai food in the West Valley, so Tom Yum had its work cut out for it. When we eat Thai, we always order the same thing first time in in order to give ourselves a solid baseline for quality. We get Pad Thai, medium heat, as the noodles tend to carry heat, and we order Yellow Curry, Thai hot. For this special occasion, we threw in an order of Tom Yum soup with chicken, extra hot.   Our bill came to $32 and change. For lunch. A little steep, me thinks, but the value was there. It was damn good. Good enough to go back the next day for more Tom Yum. It is THE BEST soup I've ever had. But it's $10 a quart. That one is tough to wrap my mind around.   The staff is extremely friendly, but still working kinks out. It seems they're trying to figure out their clientele. They said that take out orders far exceed dine in orders, but there's nothing about the dining room that's not inviting.   Overall, this is a quality experience. A little pricey, and that's why it's not a 5, but overall, very good, and an easy stand-in for Satara.  **With Satara now CLOSED, this is our go-to Thai spot.**

It almost bothers me to give this place 2 stars on one hand, on the other, it should be 1 star. I'm going to spell this out simply:  The service SUCKS.  I have been to The Perch twice. Once on a Wednesday evening, and once yesterday, Saturday Feb 21. Shall I bore you with all of the details, or are you just reading to get the big parts? Read below for the big parts, skip to the bottom for the details.  One my first visit, we arrived and got seated up stairs for Happy Hour. It took 15 minutes for the server to initiate contact. We know this isn't an all night affair, let's get to it, ya know? We ordered tator tots, and were served the garlic herb tots. The tots were good, but after the drink orders took as long to get there as the tots, we were a bit annoyed. We were looking for a quickie, and they were playing hard to get. No bueno. We had an issue with a beverage, and a server (different from the one who was serving us) came to the table to see how things were. We informed her of the drink issue, and her attitude was dismissive and left to get our server instead of dealing with the issue. It took 25 minutes to get the correct drink.   On the Saturday visit, we sat at the downstairs bar. It took me having to physically grab a server and ask her who was helping us after being there for 20 minutes. Me, because I am bold, and unapologetic about expecting good service, said to her, "We have been here twice. The food is awesome, and the service has been terrible. Why?" Her response, " We are understaffed and I am working 8 tables right now."  I said, "It's Saturday afternoon.... It's going to be busy." She nodded in agreement. This followed an order of Sangria in which they told me that they had "lost" the bottles of Sangria, and couldn't fulfill my order. LOST THE BOTTLES OF SANGRIA. Understand, we were FULLY SET on sitting at The Perch and making it a solid day of day drinking. We didn't have the opportunity; she dropped the check on us after she lost the Sangria. We spent $50 for lunch for 2 and it could have been well north of $100 each had we been able to sit and enjoy the day.    The service blows. The food is awesome. But wading through the bullshit of the bad service makes this place a complete miss for me. I'll find a place with decent to average ambiance but better service and settle in there for a day of day drinking: I'm thinking San Tan? I'm up for suggestions, though.
