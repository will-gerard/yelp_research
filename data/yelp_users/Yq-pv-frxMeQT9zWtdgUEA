I really enjoyed the Phoenix Zoo. My only real complaint is really just a whine.. I wish they could make an indoor zoo! In a place like Phoenix they really need one. The zoo is set up great although it is a little confusing. They have cool things to do like feeding Giraffes and running through a cave like thing that sprays water on you (primarily made for little kids, but that never stops me). I really admire how well they take care of their animals. I had the amazing opportunity to get an up close look at the Elephants (an absolutely amazing experience), and they really take pride in what they do. The best thing about zoos is that you don't just have to be a little kid to go, I know I will enjoy going to the Zoo until I am old and gray. The Phoenix Zoo is a great choice... preferably not during the summer.

Stoners really make amazing food. The BEST sandwiches I have ever had. I can eat a footlong and a half at subway but here i can't eat much more than a nug, the 4 inch. The atmosphere is cool whether you are a pot-head or not, and it goes without saying that the employees are always very friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious, my favorite sanwich is the Thai stick and an egg salad one that i forgot the name of. But don't forget desert. The fruit rice krispies and normal rice krispies are delicious, and so are the gooey balls.

This place is amazing, I love Hawaiian food. Everything is authenitc, fresh, and very tasty. The portions are good and always filled me up, and don't let my size fool you. I will bet money that I can eat more than you. You order at the counter and then they will bring it to your table, or you get it to go. Next to the counter is a little case of exotic beverages, unfortunately I have never tried any of them.  My favorite things to get there were the teriyaki chicken with rice which is beyond delicious, and the manapua (I think that's how you spell it). The manapua is this strange, sweet-ish roll filled with pork and it is possibly one of the most amazing foods I have ever tried, and that's saying something!

An awesome coffee place. I kind of find Coffee Rush peaceful, with the atmosphere, the outdoor tables, and the (somewhat gross) lake outside. Their drinks are delicious and the prices are good. I am always amazed at how fast they are with just one person working, at starbuck it takes them double the time with seven people working.

I love Lee Lee's! I love asian food, drinks, desserts and candy. There is such a great variety and it's a great place to buy new things to try at home, and half the time you don't know what you are buying so that just makes it all the more interesting. There is plenty of fish and assorted animals, the duck is especially delicious. There is also a section of little trinkets and sculptures and statues. Very interesting, I bought myself a golden Elephant one time.

I was introduced to Mikado's by a good friend and we all went there one night and ordered about 10x what we ended up eating. Not only is the sushi good but the other things such as tempura are also amazing. But I did get a chance to try at least a little bit of each thing and it was great. The service is great they are great at taking care of you and helping you out. The only thing I would say is that it is a bit pricey, it's not someplace that I would go on a regular basis, but every once in a while is nice.

I have gone to Andy's nails twice to get my nails done, and a few other times to accompany friends. The place is clean and smells good (no overpowering nail-polish smell), and they are always on top of everything. Even if you had no appointment you will still be taken care of fairly quickly. I have gotten acrylic nails done here twice now, and I was completely happy both times. My only complaint at all is that they are a tad bit overpriced. Other than that they are great, they have a TV to watch while you're waiting or sitting getting a mani/pedi, the staff is talkative so it isn't awkward just sitting there, and the atmosphere is good. They are convenient for the people who live near Gilbert/Riggs because they are the only nail place close by. I recommend them.

Nothing really to complain about. Personally, I think this is a better place to go just for a sundae after dinner. The food here is somewhat plain. The ice cream however, is amazing. My favorite sundaes were the top hat sundae (vanilla ice cream inside a giant cream puff, with chocolate on top), and the dusty road sundae (chocolate ice cream with malt). Most sundaes you can order in half sizes, which is a little bit smaller and a little bit cheaper. The atmosphere is fun, it's all pink including the outside. It definitely feels like your in a diner or something. There is also a bar thingy with stools that you can sit at rather than a table. Don't forget to check out the game room! I don't think I went there once without playing air hockey with someone. The service is great, the first time we went, they brought us water twice within the first two minutes! I also remember this one girl was my waitress almost every time I went after that and she was so funny! The prices are pretty fair in my opinion, the sundaes are really big and hard for a normal person to finish. not for me, however.  On a side note, if you do decide to get the top hat sundae, keep in mind that cutting apart a cold cream puff with a spoon is not the easiest thing in the world. If you accidentally fling a piece of ice cream covered cream puff across the restaurant like I did, try to do it when nobody is walking by.

What? A cultural store in the state of Arizona? You mean one besides the touristy Native American ones on every corner? Indeed you heard me correctly. For the longest time, I never even knew this store existed! It is somewhat hidden, located in the courtyard next to/behind Fatburger on Mill. I have been in there twice and I was amazed within the first 10 seconds, the first time I went in. This shop is very unique, very interesting. They have stuff from many different countries, the man will tell you that when you walk in. He will also give you a tour of the small store. I got one both times I went, it was great. I remember in particular the little things carved out of nuts, it's weird yet utterly amazing! They have so many different things; jewely, purses, beads, rings, trinkets, doo-dads, thingamagigs, etc. But seriously, it's great. The next thing I am going to get there is some kind of Elephant purse/handbag. Absolutely a great place to stop by if you are near Mill Ave. Very interesting and an awesome place for those of us in in the Valley that actually admire Culture.

I love this place! I love everything. It makes me feel like I was born in the wrong decade. There is always incense burning and classic rock playing and I always sing along to the music when I go in there. They have awesome clothes, accessories, games, incense, blankets, everything. I even love all the intricate pipes, don't judge. Remember, all of the pipes are for tobacco use only, even the ones covered in pot leafs. The service is great, everyone there is so welcoming and friendly. Probably because they are either hippies or completely stoned, maybe both. My only complaint about Hippie Gypsy is the prices! I mean yeah, it's right on Mill Ave, and they want to attract tourists and what not, but seriously?? It's ridiculous. I have only ever bought a few things there but if they were  cheaper then I would have so much of their stuff. All in all Hippie Gypsy is just a cool place to look around, I buy incense there because it's the one thing that's cheap. But maybe one day if I am ever rich, I will stop by and buy something cool.

PROS: ~The guy working the front desk (the only one, the whole 4 days I was there) was friendly. ~The other people staying there were very friendly and talkative. ~The pool was pretty cool.  CONS: ~Bad location. Pretty sketchy. ~Bad rooms. The TV did not work properly and made random loud noises. ~I kept feeling like the guy at the front desk was hitting on me, which is very unprofessional and not really acceptable. ~Breakfast was gross.  As you can see, the cons outweigh the pros. Not a great choice.

This is not your average sandwich place. Nor are they normal sandwiches. They have a Vietnamese touch so it is different. They are very fresh, all of the sandwiches that I have tried were delicious. They have various other things in this place, it's all very interesting. The prices are great. The people are friendly. Go there.

Fez is probably my favorite restaurant in the Valley. Every experience I have had there was a great one. The food is amazing, every time I come back there I had forgotten just how amazing the food is and then when I take the first bite it is pure bliss. The menu has such a good selection, I always have trouble deciding what I want. One day when I'm rich I will head over to FEZ and buy one of everything. The desserts are delicious, at first I would always get the cheesecake with nutella, but eventually tried creme brulee and mousse which where just as amazing. I couldn't ask for better service, either. They always pay attention to our table, and everyone there is so genuine and friendly. The atmosphere is really cool. Everything from the patio to the bathrooms, I remember thinking how cool the sink was the first time I went to FEZ. FEZ is without a doubt a great place to go, any day.

The state fair was pretty cool. I love how many rides they have, and how many things they have to entertain you. Oh and all the food. I absolutely love carnival food so the AZ state fair was like heaven to me. I love how you can see all the animals and even pet most of them, but I hate seeing them in cages. There were so many cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chickens, turkeys, etc. They were all so cute and almost convinced me never to eat meat again. I was later offered a tukey leg and I couldn't say no to that. The turkey legs at the state fair are HUGE and delicious. I also ate the churros, candied pecans, and fry bread. However there were some pretty interesting things there such as fried reece's and fried twinkies.

I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there. The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it. The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy.

A really great Greek restaurant. There is good variety with the food and everything is so flavorful. The service is really good, they are good about giving you good portions without charging you for each and every sauce you ask for, like some places. I recommend the gyro, or the chicken shawarma. When I am not so hungry I just order a bunch of pita (which comes fresh and warm) with tzatziki. Their tzatziki is the best around, many places in the valley don't do as good a job. I also really enjoy the salads, with all the feta and such. So delicious.

I am reviewing Mill Ave as a whole, this is different than the individual businesses on the Ave. Mill Ave seems like a fun place to hang out when you get bored, and it is, mostly. I really don't like the police force out there (are any of them good in the Valley?), they are way too in your business which they should be for disruptive or drunk people, but not really for those of us who are clearly not doing anything wrong. If I am sitting on a bench on Mill Avenue that does not imply that I am also a drunk underage drug dealer as well. However there are many disruptive people on Mill Avenue, and it seems that the cops are less worried with those who are actually committing crimes. I mean I am a firm believer in the saying "two each his own", do what you gotta do to be happy. I am not easily bothered but when I walk down a street and see a man peeing in the open, a man vomiting in a bush, a group of guys in speedos, and a group of girls in lacy bras within five minutes, I am a bit irritated. Especially because more than a few cops passed by and my friends and I are the only ones who look suspicious. There are also the countless creepers you can find on Mill Ave. I am not talking about the homeless, they are actually quite easy to get along with around there. I am referring to the guys that basically harass everyone of the female gender that walks by. I mean I suppose I should know what I'm getting myself into by heading over to a place such as Mill Avenue, but it's a bit ridiculous.

Possibly the best Mexican Restaurant. Everything I have ever tried was nothing short of amazing, but I usually got the Taco Salad. Who thought salads could be so filling? Anyway, the food is authentic and they often have bottled Coca-Cola made with cane sugar which is also amazing. The prices are also great and the service is great. I always feel welcome when I'm there. Definately put this place on your list if you're looking for a new Mexican restaurant.

I never knew Ice Cream could be so complex! Through my childhood I was always used to eating the ice cream basics. I never knew of the possibilities! Some of the flavors at Sweet Republic are a little out there.. but still amazing. I have always been pretty open to trying new weird or interesting foods, but ice cream was always supposed to be a safe bet. Lucky for me, I know that if you want to have fun in life, you have to take risks. And so I did. The strangest flavors I tried at Sweet Republic I did not expect to be good at all, I think the two most surprising were the Bacon and the Jalapeno Avacodo, which were strangely delicious. My very favorites were Mayan Chocolate and Peach, which surprisingly tasted good together. My best memory at Sweet Republic was the eating contest which unfortunately I could not take part in because I'm allergic to bananas, but watching was almost as fun. The service here is great, they are so friendly and helpful to people who are new to ice cream exploration. You can really tell that they are passionate about what they do.

I love this place. When my family first moved to Arizona, my sister and I went here all the time to get shaved ice. They have a huge variety of flavors and they always make it right. Water and Ice is owned by lovely people who are always kind and helpful, and great to talk to. Their store has a huge selection of candy, snacks, drinks, frozen treats, etc. Everything is always fresh. Their prices are fair and it always feels good to help out a family rather than go shopping next door at albertson's. Water and Ice is a great place to go for a sundae or shaved ice on those hot, Arizona days!

Whoa! This place is cool! It brings out my inner child. I went in there a few months back with a couple friends and we sat in there and played with the legos. There are shelves and buckets of organized legos, and things that I never knew existed such as lego girl hair, something that would have really came in handy back when I played with legos on a more regular basis.

Umm...... Yes. If you are looking at these reviews trying to decide if you should go there, yes.  As long as you like interesting cuisines and you aren't afraid to try something new, this place is great! Everything I had was delicious but the best part was that it was so many delicious flavors all put into a dish, making it beyond delicious. I recommend the fried yucca as an appetizer, it is so interesting and unique, yet slightly similar to potatoes. Put Mimita's on your list and make sure to try them soon, it's a great place.

I love breakfast food. Which is why I end up at Denny's so often. I'm not really big on chains and growing up I never liked Denny's, and I have even gotten an upset stomach from going to certain Denny's. This Denny's is the best one I have been to however. Their food is always fresh and fast, the service is always great, and I have never felt at all sick after eating here.

Echo Coffee is great! I would probably go there on a regular basis if I lived close enough. The coffee is delicious and well made.. and organic. I always feel good about myself when I eat/drink something organic. The people are great there and I love how they give those little cookies.. it makes it 10x better because at most coffee places you only get a coffee.  Plus the coffee looks so beautiful when they hand it to you, I always have to wait a minute before I drink it just so that I can admire that beautiful coffee.

I am reviewing the 2011 festival. BLEH! Seriously, this was gross. There was mud, everywhere. It was kinda funny watching people getting their feet stuck, but once it happened to me all the humor was gone. My shoes were ruined so I kinda feel like they owe me Forty-Five dollars. Anyway, the rides were alright, the food was ehh, all in all everything was way over priced and when I went to the stage to listen to music there wasn't any. Not gonna pay all that money again next year.

There are so many different sauces! And types of noodles! And ways that they are cooked! And, you can be a creep and watch the noodle guy through the window. The noodles are really good, and the soups are pretty good too, although I am still not sure what exactly fish balls are. I recommend the sesame paste noodles if you aren't feeling too risky. If you are feeling risky, go for the fish balls and let me know how that goes.

For people like me with diabetes looking like a definite possibility in the furture, this place is Heaven on Earth. I wish I worked there. Heck, I wish I lived there. Well maybe just a vacation home, my very own Candy Land. For those of you who have never been there, imagine a candy store the size of a CVS. With all kinds of candy. You name it, they probably have it. There is lots of bulk, and lots of name brand candy, including candy that I thought you could only really get in other Countries. They had candy there that was discontinued in most other stores, which made me even happier than I previously was. The prices are fantastic, I thought it would be way more expensive than it turned out to be.  Let's just say this place is the number one place to go for a sweet treat after a long day, a great place to bring your kids as a reward, and a horrible place for those of us with extreme sweet-tooth's who can't leave with just one or two things.

This store is awesome! There is so much random/cool/weird/interesting things you can find there. There are so many craft ideas to keep you busy! The staff is pretty helpful and helped us to find exactly what we were looking for. The one thing that I dislike is that their prices are a little steep, and I could probably find anything I was looking for at various other places, so Hobby Lobby is simply convenient because it is organized and you can find everything you're looking for there.

I had a great experience at this hookah bar. I heard that they were not good but me and my friends wanted to go and Oasis was the only one that was open at the time. Driving to it was great because I love the location in old town Scottsdale. We went in and were immediately helped, and we ordered cups of water and strawberry and peach hookah. They came back with the hookah pretty quickly and it was very smooth. The flavors were great and the combination was perfect. We then decided we were hungry and ordered some french fries. The portion was pretty good, the three of us shared it and we were content. The french fries were pretty good, i might add. The lady who helped us was friendly, talkative and relatable, and very accommodating. Later on a guy also came around to switch our coals so that the hookah wouldn't get harsh. The atmosphere was great, there were lasers and couches and a full bar. It was dimly lit which is perfect for a hookah bar. It wasn't too loud when we went. There was some kind of Middle-Eastern or Indian music playing which was interesting. I should also say that, being germaphobic, I made sure to ask if they cleaned their hookahs. The guy told me that he personally cleans the whole thing, and they even give each person a sealed disposable plastic mouthpeice. Last but not least, their prices were great. All in all a great experience, I would definitely go back.

I loved my experience here. I went to their Friday the 13th special, every piercing was 13 dollars. I ended up getting 5 and my friend got one. We bought some H2Ocean so between that, 6 piercings and a tip I think we spent 90-95 dollars. It was awesome. The staff was super friendly and helpful and I actually learned a lot that day. When we went back to get the piercings done we got to pick out the type of jewelry and they had a pretty good selection. My friend got her septum pierced and was happy but wished they had a better ring. The piercer used some kind of ink with a dropper to mark where he was going to pierce, most places use a marker that is re-used (EW!). He marked where he was gonna pierce and let us look to see if it was where we wanted it, and then he had us lay down, because every time you get a piercing your blood sugar instantly drops. We got to watch him open up the brand new needles and jewelry, completely sanitary. I got my Industrial done first, which turned out great. I then got 2nd holes on my lobes which they also do with a needle, not a gun. Those also are good. I then got my belly button pierced which turned out slightly crooked, but I have heard that it is hard to get those straight. I had a great experience here. There was a great selection, the staff was nice and helpful, and I got all the information I needed to take good care of my new piercings. I definitely recommend Rebellious Addiction to everyone.

I love frozen yogurt. But my logic is that if you are getting FroYo, you are gonna want a more refreshing and fruity flavor. If not, you want Ice cream. Every time I have been in here they have had one fruit flavor and it was always something I am allergic to or dislike. They never even had original tart, which I thought all places had. They do however have a pretty nice selection of toppings. The place is pretty clean, the service is alright, and the price is the same as most frozen yogurt places per oz.
