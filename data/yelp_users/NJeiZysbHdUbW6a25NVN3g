Similar to the other reviews I too went from liking this store to finding it has the worst customer service  ever.  We also were 'misled'  about getting a FREE tablet and have discovered that its not free, we are paying monthly for it.  If we dont want it then they told us to do a buy back for $260 - WHY?   The salesperson (who no longer works there of course!) told us it was free but the manager told me the salesperson had put it on the Edge Plan so now they are asking me to pay to get it off my account. The manager NICK MATH  was horrid, had no emotion and really didn't care.  I said we had been with Verizon for many many years and might switch companies as we were very disappointed with the service, he said go ahead and that the new company would be able to take over our numbers!  Wow.  The funny thing is when i called the main Customer Service center about another issue i had with this store a couple of weeks ago they told me this store sucks and they get so many complaints about it.  I suggest if you want to stay with Verizon to pick a different store.

I love this store.  The staff are very professional and know their merchandise.  The selection of suits is great.  I purchased a fabulous pair of pants that are supposed to be swimwear but i wear them in the evening and get lots of compliments.  Looking forward to their fall collection next.

Rich was the inspector my clients had suggested we use (I am their realtor). This was my first time using his services and I am very impressed. He did a thorough job, was very detailed  and explained everything to us at the end.  I  also liked the way he presented the report which made it easy for me to use when requesting some repairs from the seller.  I would definitely recommend him.

Wow, i was so impressed with the customer service i received from this store.  All the staff are very helpful and apparently are not on commission which makes it a far better shopping experience.  I purchased a bedroom dresser and side tables around  3.30pm  They said they could deliver that same evening if i didn't mind thedelivery  times being from 7pm -midnight.  I agreed as i really wanted to get it here same day and fully expected it to be a late delivery.  They actually arrived around 7pm - a great crew who assembled it and it looks great!  So quick and easy!  Thank you
