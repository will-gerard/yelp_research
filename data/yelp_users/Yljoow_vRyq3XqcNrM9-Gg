After a long battle of trying to get my current dry cleaners to have my laundry completed properly.  I found this place and went in to ask questions.  They are very friendly and a mom and pop shop.  The dry cleaning price was more expensive.  The laundry price was comparable to what I was currently paying so I decided I give them a try with just that.  I have been bringing them my laundry for about 6 months now.  They have been doing a good job, and I haven't had any concerns.  The owner mentioned to me the other day she would be able to match my current dry cleaners price.  So, I just may have to move that over also.

I've been coming here since 2014.  I initially brought my laundry over, however I now bring my dry cleaning here as well.  The owner is always very nice and I've yet to have any issues here.

Showed up at about 6:45p, the place was  full with the exception of a couple of tables.  The sign asked for us to wait to be seated so we did just that.  The server behind the counter looked at us and that was it.  In the 5-10 min wait by the door, another lady behind the counter further down made eye contact a couple of times so I smiled at her.  All the while we are watching the server go between bussing tables and delivering food and drinks.  The service didn't look too sanitary between grabbing dirty glasses and plates then handling plates she delivered.  So we decided to leave.  I was expecting a wait after reading the reviews, however I just can't get past the level of cleanliness.

I have been using this place for about 2 years.  I usually bring about 10-20 pieces of clothing a week.  Unfortunately, they have issues with their laundry.  I had a dry cleaning only shirt put in the laundry and it had stains all over it.  I also had some burn marks on my shirts.   It was a mess trying to deal with the owner.  He seems to be too busy to deal with the guests or even return their messages.  I ended up taking my laundry over to another company and will be soon moving my dry cleaning as I don't feel anyone who is too busy to acknowledge a guest should continue to receive my money.

I found this place looking for something quick and they went beyond my expectations.  The servers were great and attentive.  The Garden Fresco Burrito is delicious and humongous!  Great vegetarian option!!   The chips and salsa were good as well.

We came out to Stufrageous tonight.  I had the jalape√±o popper chicken burger & my nine year old son had the Caprese beef burger.   The burgers are delicious!!  We didn't put any extra condiments on the burgers, they were great as is.    The fries were good, and go great with the Homemade Outrageous Sauce!     We were pretty stuffed from the burgers and sharing a fries.  We didn't have room for dessert, maybe next time?    The guy(Cristian) at the front was very helpful and his service was great!  You gotta try them out!

This place is one of Mesa's little gems in downtown.   For the $2 price of one large ice cream scoop then sandwiched by two delicious cookies, you can beat it!!  Try buying the same somewhere else?  I dare you!!
