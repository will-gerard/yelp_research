I love the location and atmosphere of this place. It's dark inside with a dive bar feel and a huge open outside with plenty of misters to stay cool. My favorite item on the menu is the Rockefeller Oysters! It takes about 30 minutes to get them but they are worth the wait! They also have a full bar!

Cornish Pasty Company is the best! If your looking for amazing comfort food all wrapped in a flaky crust this is the place! I haven't had one that I didn't like. My all time favorite is the Bangers & Mash! Its like your moms home cooking of meatloaf and mashed potatoes with extra gravy. The service at this location is great, they are very friendly and outgoing. I've even eaten here alone and felt totally comfortable eating at the bar. They also have a great selection of beer. If you haven't tried this place out you need to go . . . like right now!

La Bocca is a cute place to go on a date night or ladies night. The atmosphere is great, with the dimmed lights and city vibe. The bruschetta is great paired with their red sangria! The pear salad and any of the pizzas are great as well. I love that this place is easy to walk in and sit down and order without much of a hassle.

After shopping in the antique mall me and my family were hungry from covering so much territory (the mall is huge), we decided to grab a hot dog. It was delicious! I love that they have a variety of different types of toppings you would not even think of to put on a hot dog. What was the must impressive was the customer service! The staff was very friendly and made sure to reach out to each customer  to make sure they were enjoying their meal and experience. They have a deliciously creative approach and I'm a fan!

Canteen is a great place for happy hour and to meet up with a large group of friends! They have an awesome large patio with a bar outside that makes it great to enjoy the weather at night. You can't go wrong with their margaritas, guacamole, and chips! You can come here for a happy hour on a Friday night, end up staying way later than you thought, and dance on the dance floor. They have an awesome dj that plays top 40 music! It's a great place to enjoy your friends and many drinks!

This place deserves an applaud for their awesome gluten free pizza! It's already hard to find places that offer gluten free pizzas but when you find a place that offers it and has a super tasty crust then you've hit the jackpot! It has a fun "pizza joint" type atmosphere and is in a great location with friendly customer service.

I got the strawberry lemonade cupcake. The icing was very sweet and didn't have any noticeable flavor. I was expecting to taste more of a tart lemon. The cake was a bit dry but I could taste the  strawberry flavor. The cost isn't worth it. I think you could pick up similar cupcakes at your local Safeway.

I've been a fan of this place since it opened in Tempe. I love that the atmosphere is laid back and open. The large patio is always a perk when you want to relax and enjoy the weather. They have a great selection of beers and cocktails to try and their pretzels are great when they are served hot! All in all this is a great laid back spot to go when you're not looking for a wild party.

My experience was a good one. We drove up and got the car valet because there was no parking. Put our names on the list to get a table and waited at the bar. Once we finally got a table we proceeded to our table as directed and brought along our pretzels and fondue. I had the Pub Burger and it was delicious. I love the ambiance, I love the food, and I love the music and staff. We had a slight incident with the general manager worth mentioning because in the end he was the upmost gentleman and treated us with care and kindness.
