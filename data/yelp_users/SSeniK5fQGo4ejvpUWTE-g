Be it cats or dogs, this location has been my local carne asada watering hole for over a decade now. Sure, it's dirty. Sure, there's only outdoor seating and sure, there are occasional bullet holes in the ceilings, but nevertheless the food is always the same; greasy drunken night goodness! I love you filly b's! You always know to keep me regular.

Always love coming here. It's always packed and the outdoor patio looks out over a nice lake. Service is always decent, nothing special. It's a healthy alternative to anything else, I think.

I love this place. Every time I come in I have a different hair stylist and all of them always exceed my expectations. I love how they keep my hair cut logged into their system so I don have to explain what I want every time  I come visit. All the ladies are friendly and they all do a great job. It keeps me coming back

I frequently visit this caffeine oasis and every time I do I'm left with great service, decent coffee and free wifi internet. If I could count how many "A" worthy papers I've written here this review would be a mile long. I love the atmosphere, the awesome patio. The only, and I emphasize only, negative aspect of the place is the constant barrage of teeny boppers and hipsters that come in and just post up shop for hours. It's a bit intimidating at first but I got used to it. Other than that one sour note I love this place.

Great Korean in the valley of the sun! If you're looking for authentic Korean stews and BBQ Korean short ribs, this place is the place to be. I recommend the soon tofu soup with mixes seafood, so bomb!

Always good. Sushi selection is good and the food is always decent. For a buffet it's easily one of the best in the east valley.

Arizona lacks Irish pubs and this pub is exactly what that is. The bartenders remember you by name and for the most part they know you by drink! Fast friendly service! Their food is also surprisingly fantastic! You wouldn't think a place like this would have such phenomenal food. I love this place!

Love this place, can't believe I haven't written them a review before! My family always chooses Mido for any family gathering. For sushi they are one of the best! They never overly pack in the rice like other competitors and the portions of raw fish is always more than generous. The owners daughters are always so nice when they greet customers and I love family owned mom and pops restaurants. Great blend of neighborhood feel with the right amount of professionalism! Love it!

I love Filibertos, especially after a long night of drinking with your buddies. But this one time was probably the worst experience ever. Salty cold meat. Enough said. Just sick.

Jim Jeon is quick, efficient and the salons atmosphere is so friendly and family oriented. I love how the cuts are affordable and Jim definitely knows what he is doing. It's also awesome how his wife is at the shop because she is so warm and friendly. Love the family and I love what they do!

Despite all the negative reviews, every time I've eaten here I've received fantastic service. The food is good, UFC fights are free and the servers that I've had are pretty damn hot. Numerous flat screens throughout the bar, drinks are good. The only negative thing I would have to say is that some of the servers seem very un professional. I think their friends or boyfriends frequent the bar because I've seen servers sit down with them, sneak a few bites with them, and I've seen servers rubbing guys backs and even grabbing some ass. I didn't mind but being a business owner myself, that kind of behavior from my employees would make me flip. I understand they're trying to create a neighborhood bar atmosphere but I can see how it can be misconstrued as unprofessional by other patrons such as myself. Other than that, my server, who I think is part African American, is not only epically hot but she is a fantastic server. I'll love this place as long as I receive the great service that I'm accustomed to from babes.

Always fast, clean, and the service is always good. I couldn't wait for this location to open so I could have fresh sandwiches delivered to me on matter of minutes. I'm definitely a sandwich lover and I love jimmy johns whole grain wheat bread as opposed to their white. Keep it up JJ crew!

Haven't been out to the Tempe area in a while since I graduated from ASU but today I found myself in the area for work and I was craving Indian food. Was about to go to our usual Indian spot on university and rural when I yelped Nandini and the reviews were great. Now, I don't judge restaurants solely on yelp reviews but I decided to give Nandini a shot and I was really glad that I did. The interior was so clean and the lunch buffet was so affordable! Definitely comin back here for Indian when I'm in Tempe!

First time at this location, looks like I'll be the first person to write a comment!   Always love this place, started going to the old town location first and now that there is one so close to my house? I'm thrilled. Great food, plenty of beers to choose from, amazing amount of tvs surrounding the entire dining area! Sports fans, hold on to those hats because this place is the place to be for any game!

Just had my first haircut here at Geo's barbershop and I'm extremely happy with my cut! As a small business owner I know how important customer service is and Geo's customer service is excellent. Geo was very attentive to my particular style and he took his time and was very meticulous. And it only took 20 minutes! I love small business, it's the backbone to our economy and I support these guys. It's a family run barbershop which I love. Congrats to Geo and his family for opening up their own shop and I'll see them again in a few weeks!

Visited last night for the first time. Avoided the one on Mill because it's college student central so I was glad to hear they opened one up near me in the east valley. Happy hour is absolutely amazing! My friends and I drank to our fullest and even shared an appetizer and the total bill was astonishing! I was ready to fork over at least $70 dollars but it wasn't even close to that. Bartender was great, even chose great music for that time of night.   In regards to the poor ratings, I feel bad for newly established restaurants. It's hard work, and yes I agree everything should be ready to go once the doors are open but people should give new restaurants more than one chance. I gave them 4 stars because I haven't had their pizza yet. Hopefully I can give them a 5 once i try the pies!
