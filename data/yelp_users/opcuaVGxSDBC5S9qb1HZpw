Ambiance is great.  Food is terrible.  I had a carne asada dish that went haywire somewhere between the guacamole and marinara sauce that were poured on top of it.  Not exactly sure who thought that would be a good combination.  Maybe Cheech and Chong?    Go for a cocktail, look at the pretty people, eat elsewhere.

I love Next.  I love the coffee and I love the atmosphere.  I can sit there for hours.  One of the best little hideouts in Glendale.

After 10 years of living in Manhattan, NY, I have finally found a new restaurant in Scottsdale which serves high quality, haute italian cuisine.  Yes the portions are small, but its a tasting menu.  They are designed to take you on a wild flavor journey--which they certainly do.  Such a huge step up from the lack of substance this Valley has to offer!  If you think the food at places like the Vig and Postino are what high end eating is all about, this is probably not the place for you.  Splurge and take someone special on a date here.  And let the staff help you with wine pairings.    Seating on the patio is great.  The inside is totally kitsch but could be saved with some decent ambiance lighting.
