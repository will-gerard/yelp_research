We rode our bikes over to this shop down the street. We got there late on Sunday around 12-1230 and to our surprise there were still some doughnuts/pastries available. We got 3 doughnuts and two iced coffees. The doughnuts were amazing but the coffee a little on the weaker side. We will definitely return and I'll find something a little more for me on the drinks side.  The outside furniture could have been better. A new patio set is cheap and adds curb appeal.  See you next time!

Amazing. Dragonfly noodles with chicken, pho with beef, Las Vegas roll and flaming tuna roll. All exceptional. Service was amazing and quick. Place was also very clean.

I've been to Santa Fe and Las Cruces and spent time there. I know hatch green chiles when I see them and taste them. The food was amazing. My mom thought the tacos were too spicy when they weren't supposed to be but she's picky lol the rest of the bunch ate the food and was 100% satisfied with food and service. Atmosphere was laid back and great things to look at.

Love the salads!! Great selection and portions are enough. Not too small and not too much.

Pig of Palermo.  Phenomenal.  We came here the first time for lunch and it was the best. We will definitely be heading back because there are 4 other burgers I NEED to try.  They have a few sauces that I tried, jalape√±o ranch, spicy ketchup.. Yummmmmy :)

Richerd was my associate and what a wonderful job he did. Above and beyond; at first. Answered all my questions and spent a little extra time with me to help figure the best course of action for my situation.  Everything was great until the next day, when I'm on the freeway heading to work and a loud noise from my right side axle/tire area begins once I reach 60 mph. (I had a driver axle replaced and lower control arms).  I end up leaving work early to ensure myself and 5 yr old are safe.  After 5 test drives and some clanking around, I'm told that when the lower control arms were replaced the brake plate ($70-80)was bent during the uninstall/installation and they were going to keep bending the plate until it was back to normal as a solution. I was told I would have to bring my truck back so they could take off the brake pads and rotors to hammer out the plate back to normal. Hmmm... I hop in my truck and my floor mats have grease/oil all over it like the first guy who initially took my truck out didn't place protection on it. My truck is clean. Very clean. This was truly disappointing. I don't even want to go back for repair.  I spent over two hours at the location and took the rest of the day off work to find out they messed up and were just going to "make it work". Again, I appreciate them helping me timely but this shouldn't have happened in the first place and I have yet to be offered any kind of compensation. I just spent over $1000 and have more repair/work to do.  Maybe some gas since they had to take my truck on the fwy five different times at speeds over 70. Maybe a gift card for time lost at work. Maybe a credit of some kind as I've made many notions of returning for tires, struts and a leveling lift. I would think I would be taken care of; especially after reading such great reviews. (The whole reason I came to Fletcher's and not a cheaper place on the block)  I text Richerd about the cost of a brake plate being 70-80$ in hopes he would continue our texting conversation but he didn't reply after that.  Again..the staff was pleasant and helpful but that's only part of the equation when trusting someone with one of your biggest investments. Bottom line, I expected a little more from Fletcher's. I'm sure they will resolve the issue.

On our way next door to the famous chipotle we noticed a sign saying Italian eatery. Decided why not. Best decision I've made in a long time. Service was the friendliest ever. Informative. The food was absolutely amazing. Margie is the best!!!! Love love love! 6 stars!

Lady and I came here for the first time and went back three times within the next two weeks.  Burritos are large - carne :)  Tacos are like street tacos so you can get a few. The flavors are so intense. How tacos are supposed to be. Recommended to many friends and a few made the drive to Mesa (where I now live) and they loved it. So, it's not just me lol
