I've been to many Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes locations, and this was the best!  The selection was good, all items were fully stocked, but best of all, everything was fresh and the restaurant was clean!  Staff was among the friendliest I've seen at a buffet.  Yummy!

Beware! This credit union charges a $25 account closing fee!  I have accounts with 3 other credit unions and 4 other banks; NONE of them charge an "account closing fee".  When I opened an account here, this fee didn't exist. At some point in the last few years, they added the fee and supposedly notified customers in the usual account mailings that I love to ignore. When I closed the account, I was surprised by the fee and complained, but the customer reps just kept saying "you had a chance to close out the account when the policy change was mailed out." Well, I'll instead take this chance to warn my fellow yelpers of this strange fee. And who knows what new strange fees they'll add in the future?  I would steer clear of this credit union!

You can't go wrong with this grocery store. The price is right and they get so much business so the food is fresh all the time. I like that the aisles are organized by country; Korean, Japanese, Middle Eastern. The boss man, Ming, is very friendly and helpful all the time.  My family's favorite, for sure!

Resort??? I don't think so. We spent over an hour getting moved from one room to the next, trying to find a halfway decent place to sleep.   1st room: Strong mildew smell 2nd room: Cigarette Smell (later found out the building used to be a smoking building) 3rd room: Toilet was broken and made intermittent sounds 4th room: Lighter mildew smell  We were so tired by the 4th room that we gave up moving rooms and just decided to call it a night. Each time, they sent someone out with a new key (a 15+ minute process). Then we'd drive to the new room, only to find the next problem and start the wait all over again.  The rooms feel more like a motel than anything else. They have those old-fashioned, motel-style AC units that are ridiculously loud. Don't pay more than $40 for a night in this "resort".

Very friendly staff! Clean, welcoming atmosphere. Good selection of healthy foods. Excellent wines at excellent prices. Food samplings are a plus! Low prices!  It's all good at Trader Joe's!

Had their buffet 2 years ago. Tables were greasy, floors were dirty. And I distinctly remember the discolored salmon that had the strangest texture.  I got food poisoning afterward, and haven't been back to see if things have improved. Unless their management has changed since then, I will not go back.  I would go to these other buffets over China Town Buffet anyday - Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler, Hong Kong Gourmet in Ahwatukee, and Crazy Buffet in Tempe.

Memphis Championship Barbecue has perfected the fried okra. Their sauce is nicely balanced and complements the meat well.  The baby back ribs and pork shoulder were great with extra sauce, but alone were slightly dry. Loved the sweet apple tea. Service was great as well.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience. I'll surely return for more Championship Barbecue!

I heart Hikari.  They let me eat however much I want of whatever I want. Other sushi buffets will make sure you fill up on rice, but not Hikari. Sashimi is included in their buffet; they even let me order items in the Nigiri section and leave out the rice. Very flexible and accommodating sushi chefs.  I loved the Kama (grilled yellow tail collar).  I haven't had this anywhere else, but it's in my Fav 5 now.  The super white tuna and soft shelled crab were also delicious.  I ate so much, the sushi chef told me I owe them food next time I come in. Very funny sushi chefs indeed (though I'm not entirely sure he was joking...). I waddled out a happy man.  Note:  If you don't eat raw items, you're probably better off ordering off the regular menu.

One word: Chilean Seabass  Very friendly staff; we were amazed by our waitress who refilled our drinks and took all our plates with a smile on her face. If you knew how many plates we went through, you'd be amazed as well. Then there was the manager who saw my disappointment that the fresh strawberries had been put away and brought out a large bowl of strawberries just for me (also with a smile on her face).  Sure, the crab legs had dark spots on them. And might've tasted like ammonia. But everything else was great!  Wynn used to be my go-to buffet, but I think it's not enough better than Bellagio to justify the price. And they don't even have Chilean Seabass.  So at the $20-30 price point, Bellagio is the place to go!

This show was thoroughly disappointing for me.   I judge these types of shows based on 3 categories: story line, acrobatics, and effects. And KA rates poorly in all categories.  If I have one thing good to say about KA, it's their ability to make the show look so cool on their posters.

At Changing Hands Bookstore, they've got a LOT of stuff! And friendly staffers to help find what you're looking for!  They've obviously got the new/used books, but then they've got everything from windchimes to hand-held pig catapults! After hours of reading, who wouldn't want to launch some pigs from a catapult? You've really got to see it for yourself, but this place has some cool stuff!   But remember to bring in your used books for store credit. You're gonna need all the credit you can get for the prices they charge!

Red Rock Casino is a godsend to people who want a great experience away from the strip.  This resort has high ceilings and elegant design. It's the Venetian of off-the-strip casinos, but with lower minimums!  In addition, Red Rock also has some fine restaurants, an IMAX movie theater, bowling alley and a poppin' nightclub (Cherry).  Although I haven't seen the hotel rooms, I expect it to be as grand as the casino surroundings.  This is my new favorite place to gamble...... as long as I keep winning :-)

My expectations were way too high going into this place. After reading spectacular Yelp reviews and seeing the most beautiful sandwiches ever on the posters, I was ready to be blown away. Yet as I sit here writing this review, I find myself clearly not blown away.  With that said, I did enjoy the flavors of the Full Montagu and the Earl's Club. I preferred the taste of the Club: smoked bacon + turkey = delicious, roast beef + turkey = meh.  My biggest complaint was the amount of filling; I was reminded of those generic store-made donuts with the pea-sized amount of jelly inside. I felt like I had to savor every morsel of meat like a homeless child on Christmas. Ok maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but I did feel seriously scammed by the meat to bread ratio shown in the posters.   The sandwiches are A-OK for me. But the price and location on the strip bump it to 4 stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to have it, but if I happen to be nearby and too hungry to wait for a buffet or steak & eggs special, then sure, I'll be back.

The Yummy: Good prices, friendly staff, fresh selection, bright & spacious atmosphere, parking spots reserved for hybrids (eco-friendly store)  The Yucky: Be careful when shopping for the near-expired food. Even though they're 50% off, some things are better left uneaten.

I would list off all the superlatives I know, but I think my vocabulary simply doesn't do this show justice.  Voices were amazing; if you can appreciate great singing, this is THE show to see. A superb, 6-star performance that had me spellbound from beginning to end.

This is the coolest rock gym I've seen, by far!  I'm not an expert rock climber, but I have been to several rock gyms in California, and none were as large or well-designed as this one.  Prices are great, and even better if you get a group together.  And a very friendly staff, to boot!

Well, I wouldn't call myself a Chinese buffet expert. But if there were such a title, I would like to say I'm in the running since it's become sort of a family tradition of mine to try new Chinese buffets.  And in my maybe-expert opinion, World Buffet is among the top, with the exception of a few dishes:  - the coconut shrimp, honey chicken, and spicy salt shrimp dishes were soggy (should be crispy dishes). - sashimi was not properly thawed and still had bits of ice on it - bathrooms smelled really bad  With all these negatives, 'WHY would you give 4 stars', you ask?  Staff was friendly, dining area was clean, food was not too salty, fruit looked fresh, sushi looked fresh (albeit some were still close to frozen)...all things I RARELY say about Chinese buffets.  With the exception of the dishes previously mentioned, the food was at or above par. I particularly enjoyed the beef short ribs, clams, coffee cake, fish balls with pork filling (in soup), and fried crab. These dishes were the best I've tasted in a Chinese buffet.  High ceilings and a brightly-lit atmosphere are icing on the cake.  And the cherry: compared to similar buffets, World Buffet is a couple bucks cheaper ($11.99 on a weeknight).  Now if I could only become a professional buffet critic...

To tell you the truth, I prefer this free show to many paid shows in Vegas. I must've seen it more than 10 times and it still amazes me.  The coordination of music, water and light is spectacular. I've only seen it from street level and might try to catch it from higher ground next time.  If they only served free food during the show, I would give it 6 stars.

A small Korean grocery store, a bit more pricey than others.  Friendly owner and fresh/moderately priced beef is all that bring me back.  If I lived near ASU, I would probably go a lot more often, but as it stands, there are more moderately-priced Asian grocery stores to choose from (like Lee Lee, Mekong, Asiana).
