Adobe Carpet Cleaning is UNETHICAL and you should NEVER do business with them. We're on the FCC's "Do Not Call" list, but Adobe Carpet Cleaning repeatedly breaks the law by calling us several times a week. They have done this for months even though we have politely asked them to stop, then angrily asked them to stop, then yelled at them to stop. Sometimes, they've called us three times a day, even harassing our young kids.  NEVER USE ADOBE CARPET CLEANING.

Mr. Chao's used to be a favorite of ours, but we hadn't been there in a several months. We noticed a new menu with new items and slightly higher prices, so we were wondering if there was an ownership change or just a need to rein in costs.  Ordered the hot and sour soup which was very good, if a touch too vinegary (my wife thought it was perfect). We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef and that's where the problems came in.   The sauces and flavors were outstanding as usual, but the quality of the meat was very poor. The chicken was all fatty dark meat and the beef was also fatty and too chewy. I had to spit out several pieces.  Also, the proportions of meat to vegetables was much too small, as if the restaurant wanted to fill our plates with cheaper veggies. (The Mongolian Beef should have been called Mongolian Onion.)  I know it's a tough economy and appreciate the need to cut costs. But customers are also cutting expenses, so we'll avoid Chao's until they improve the quality.

Our usual carpet cleaner wasn't available, so I gave Brimley's White Glove a try. VERY glad I chose them.   A lot of carpet cleaners bait-and-switch you with "free" deals only to charge you a fortune once they get done. Others hire shady characters who barely look able to function a vacuum cleaner let alone shampoo your carpets.  Brimley's technician (Steve) was extremely professional, polite, helpful and thorough. He gave of all kinds of options but didn't pressure us. Highly recommend their service.

Great decor, cool vibe, but my first visit ended up with a poor macchiato. A little light on the foam and grounds - yes grounds - in the cup. I really wanted to like it since I had heard great things, but that's a pretty bad gaffe. I'm hoping I just caught them on a bad night so I might try them again when I'm in the area.

I've been coming to Miele's for years and I never thought to review them until now. In all the years I've been coming I have never had a bad meal or poor service. I just returned from a family dinner and wanted to sing their praises.  My favorite dish is their amazing Cavatelli Bolognese. The pasta itself is made with ricotta and is served with a robust red meat sauce with a bit of cream. The pizzas are fantastic with fresh ingredients and without the grease you get at most places.  The pasta and Italian entrees are all top-notch and the staff is very friendly, efficient and thoughtful. It is by far my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area.

When traveling for business, I've dined at hundreds of in-hotel restaurants. The food is safe, bland, unexceptional and overpriced.  Frankly that's what I expected when we stopped in to Fire & Spice. Thankfully, I was very wrong.  The food offered is creative southwestern cuisine with a nod towards Sonora and northern New Mexico. The basics of salsa, beans and corn were all excellent and the enchiladas were delicious. The service was great as well.  Thanks for exceeding my expectations!

A very disappointing experience. We walked in to find no hostess or wait staff in sight. After walking around and finding no hostess station, we eventually sat ourselves at the only open (dirty) table.  A waiter told us we shouldn't have sat down and might have to move, but then later allowed us to remain there. I then ordered a Michelada and he "corrected" my pronunciation (naturally, he was pronouncing it incorrectly). The drink was great though.  Ordering dinner, I asked for the chilaquiles and he said, "what?" When I pointed to it on the menu, he again wrongly "corrected" my pronounciation, adding, "nice try though." Again, he gave a strange gringo pronunciation that doesn't exist in Spanish and walked off.   We got guacamole, assorted tacos, cheely-keelies (as he called them), all of which were good, but not great. Drinks weren't re-filled and another server tried to clear my place while my plate was still half-full. We were thinking about ordering dessert when our waiter dropped off the check. Since they were in such a hurry to turn tables, I obliged them.  Whew. Gotta do better than that Gallo Blanco.

The best fried chicken I've ever eaten, a serious collection of southern soul food, the staff is great, even the customers are fun. You gotta go to Lo-Lo's.

Imagine if a traditional diner used excellent ingredients and displayed cooking chops and attention to detail.

This place takes a lot of care in their coffee. They roast the beans on site, drip the coffee before your eyes and have a wide selection of classic, high-quality espresso drinks.   The decor is calming and cool with plenty of comfortable seating and ample wi-fi. I'm looking forward to several return visits.

Chou's offers the best Chinese food in Arizona, hands down.  Granted, that sounds like a back-handed compliment such as "the tallest building in Fresno" or "the best song by Nickleback," but the food is truly outstanding. The Phoenix area now offers several good Asian eateries and Chou's is at the top of the pack.  On our first visit, we had the potstickers, Kung Pao Chicken and Green Beans with Pork. Holy [fill in the blank] were they amazing. The owners were great too, offering great conversation, advice and lightning-fast service.   Most Chinese food in town is really lousy. A few restaurants are acceptable in a pinch. But I would be proud to bring guests from any city to Chou's and they would love every bite.

New neighborhood Italian joint that sadly didn't meet expectations. It has only been open for a week, so hopefully these issues will be resolved in time.  The price point is high and the food quality was rather low. I loved the complementary family-style salad, but that was about it. Much of the food had odd, unexpected flavors including the entre√©s, dipping oil for bread -- even the tea. All of these items had several individual flavors which just didn't come together and one flavor that made you think, "what IS that?"  The staff was very friendly, but green. I couldn't get drink refills and dropping off/picking up food was a bit clumsy. But, again, they were nice and trying hard which means a lot.  I want this place to succeed and, as noted above, let's hope they improve with experience. With so many Italian options available with better quality at a lower price, they will have to improve.

After visiting the Scottsdale and Phoenix Lo-Lo's several times, I wanted to try the newer Gilbert location. The service was fantastic and the chicken and waffles were perfect. Looking forward to visiting again soon.
