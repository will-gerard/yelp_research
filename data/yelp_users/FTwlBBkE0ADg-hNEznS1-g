We eat here every time we got to a game. I love their salads and fries. My husband always gets the sliders. They taste good and aren't a dry slab of meat. Sadly the outside doesn't have servers so if you want to eat you have to order inside and then take it to your seat. The only thing I don't like is the very load alarm they ring when a person orders e big unit. My son freaks out and has fit. so, not great for sensitive people.

Don't go here. I had a lot of issues with the front office lady. She was rude about my records that should have been transfered to the office. She pretty much did not want to deal with me.   Dr bailey was nice but really didn't want to listen to what i had to say and had his own opinions about my vertigo issue. After that visit i never went back.  He was highly recommended by my doctor but too much hassle and too far for me to drive.

Please do not take your children to any Maxwell preschool Academy ever! My son was there for about 2 years and was in one classroom with a child who constantly picked on him and beat him up.   I was told by shannon that they tested the boy and he had behavioral problems. She stated they informed the parents but the parents didn't want to do anything about it and were in denial. I asked her if they do anything about it like kick the children out. she said that they don't do that but they try to work with the parents and get counselors in. But that never happened.   My son started to get restless in the three year old so I asked shannon to put him in with the 5. He had already learned everything and needed to be more challenged. She did put him in with the 5 year olds and he did great for some time.   But then one day they sent that child into the room with my son and that child stabbed my son with a pencil in the forehead. I had told Shannon that this is causing a big problem and that my son is starting to be aggressive at home. I told her she did not fix it that I would contact the board on them. She apologized profusely and advised that she would make sure it wouldn't happen again.   I have also found out from other teachers that if shannon has anything against the parent, she will pick on the child. And if the child says something to the parent she plays it off like Oh they're being kids and it's their fault. I am so glad we moved away and had to leave the school. Never again.

Love this place. They up hold the highest of standards on how a child should be taught how to swim. They do not cut corners and every single staff member, I have ever encountered, is extremely nice and professional.  It does take a bit longer, than you would think, for a child to pass a level, but that is only because they want a child to get the fulllist of education, on how to swim properly. Also some deck managers that review the child are stricter than others. all you have to do is speak with the child's swim instructor and they will work with you on what needs to be done to pass the child.  This is not a school for a child to do a sloppy job and expect to pass. They work very hard to make sure that the child swims properly.   They do high standard instruction for a great price.

Nice place to eat when we come up to visit family. We always sit in the bar for happy hour. Everything I have tried tastes great. The last time we went their systems were down and they still got everything to us I  a timely manner.

We eat here so that our four year old son can play out by the lake with the ducks. The chicken salad is huge and very good for the price. We usually sit in the bar area for the happy hour prices. The food is normal for mexican. Nothing special but still the best place to go. The only down side. If you want to sit outside, you will be surrounded by ducks. Other than that, a good place to go.

This place is 50/50.  I had brought my son in at 6 months old because he cried for three days straight. After torturing him to get a catheter in, the nurses tell me he is dehydrated. I end up staying with him for 3 days. Let's start by saying the nurses never offered food to me or if I needed anything.  I had to ask for a cot on the first night. By the 3rd day I was starving. My son's father came to visit him. I was tired and hungry and had asked him to bring me food and clothes. Of course he refused. I was visibly upset and crying. Come to find out CPS was at my door after my son was released stating that the hospital called on me. Awesome. She did one visit and passed me with flying colors.   When my other the son was sick. I went to the ER because he was was dizzy. The nurse asked me if he was on any medications. I advised that he was on medication prescribed by his doctor that had codeine in it. She stated to me that that's what is causing him to be dizzy. that I should not have given him that medication though the doctor said it was fine and gave it to me. She said it was too much and it was making him dizzy, even even though she did not know.   I was finally seen by the doctor and even the doctor stated that the dosage I was giving him was not enough. so, prove that nurse wrong. She asked me several other questions but seemed very accusing on everything she asked as if I was doing something to my child. The doctor was kind and the X ray techs were great but it just depends on who you get here and who will call CPS on you.

This is the only $0.99 store I will go to. It's clean and the cashiers are friendly. They have tons of items even though I don't want them I still buy them. And their seasonal aisle has gotten much better. I also noticed that their shelves have gotten taller which helps with them adding more items.

This place was bought out by another person a year ago. He named it Taka Sushi but hasn't changed the name on the outside.  There are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it. Ending in service going down hill.

Don't go here if you need anything. They tried making it into a super Walmart but failed miserably.  There is no one around and if you need anything, go to the other two walmarts that are 3 miles apart, in the opposite direction. Super fail.

Meh. I went here for an appointment with Anastasia for gel and glitter. I waited patiently and ended up with an appointment with a completely different person than what I was told I was going to see.   I asked her I wanted gel with glitter and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said she can do gel polish with glitter in it but not any type of loose glitter with gel. The lady they gave me only does regular acrylic nails and was even too afraid to do the glitter as she didn't know what she was doing. Finally another lady said that she can do it but that i would need to wait a moment until she's finished with the appointment.   I waited a half an hour and finally saw the lady. I did not realize that she was pushing me in between her appointment and she did it very quickly, maybe lasted about 20 minutes. I have never had my nails done that only takes 20 minutes. She ended up using a shellac gel instead of an actual gel builder. And it was very clumpy and uneven, to were you could see a dip in the middle of each of my nails.   The only reason I'm giving it any stars is that the owner was very apologetic and tried to accommodate the situation, but I was disappointed.   Also, I had went there with a spa finder gift card. I had $10 left. instead of just taking the money off of that card and giving me the card to go somewhere else, the receptionist traded it for a total bliss card. This now, forces me to have to go back to them just use the rest of the card.

I would give Mayo clinic 0 stars if I could. I have had several appointments at the blvd Mayo clinic and have found myself in so many issues, it seem I am doing their job. First, I was told that I needed four different appointments and that I would be called when they are made. Never received a call. I found out when I call to complain to the neurologist that I was not feeling well. I was Advised by the assistant that the neuro was not their but will give me a call on Monday. I never received a call. I finally called Tuesday and screamed up a storm until the MD Spoke with me.   I explained to her my problems and was advised of a plan. I was going to do the Botox injections at their office. She put in the Prior Authorization on March 26th. In the mean time I had other appointments. I found out that one of the appointments was to see A phyciastric who was suppost to prescribe me medication. come to find out they send all patients there and its only a one time visit. She refused to prescribe my medication and told me that the Neuro probably only sent me to her to get permission for the Neuro to prescribe the medication. That is not what I was told.   I then check back at the end up April on my Prior Authorization and find out that I have other appointments that were scheduled. Again was not called and was never sent any information. I was furious to find out that Mayo submitted the Auth but it was still pending at this time because my insurance changed to electronic filing instead of paper. Pre certification never bothered to check up on the progress. It is now May. I finally get so upset about this Auth that I drive up to Mayo From Chandler to find out what is going on. I have Susan who send the messages to Pre Cert that she messaged them after I called and people were out so not one checked on the auth. She then tells me that I can call pre cert and find out what is going on. I call they tell me they are working on it and to call my insurance. I call my insurance and they transfer me three times. I got nowhere.   I call later for the apppointment that was a follow up with the neuro. Susan tells me that they have not received the auth but I can use the follow up appontment for the injection procedure if I am approved by then. Well the day comes and I am now told I have to reschedule because they cannot get the auth. I call them and find out that thy have no later appointments to put me in. They have not injection appointments until august. I am in pain and they expect me to do what I need to do when Pre Cert and The Neuro department dropped the ball. I proceed to tell them that I can only come in later. They put me in a 3:30PM spot and telll me to come then even though the PA may not be completed. I want to complain.  They transfer me to a liason who tells me that they are the place to set complaints and can do something for mey. This was the same as what Susan told me. my phone disconnects in the middle of the complaint. I call back to get the womans name I was speaking with and get Joell. she proceeds to tell me that they cannot do anything I have to talk to pre cert who the issue is with. I tell them that Susan and the previous person told me that I needed to speak to you. I demand A boss. She refuses to give me the information. joell then tells me that she will have the Neuro manager Kathleen Tuttle call me. I waited until 4:30PM and received a call. But I missed it. I tried to call back and was advised that I needed to leave a message. needles to say I have not gotten anywhere  On the other Side. I was also told to see an ENT this was one of the appointments in the beginning. I was upset with this department because they lost my enrollment information from the Neuro. I had to refill out that information. When I was called the woman walked about 15 feet ahead of me did not say hello. I had to chase after her just to make sure I knew where I was going. She then takes me to a room tells me the MD will be in and then Leaves. Nothing. The Doctor just had Vocal surgery so I could not hear him but he was nice. Told me what he thinks is wrong and proceeded to tell me I need a CT of my ears. Great A two second appointment just to tell me to have more tests.   There is something greatly wrong with Mayo clinic. at least the one on Mayo blvd. Good luch everyone.

Love this place. I don't even drink and I definitely will go here if anyone suggests it. All of their beer is brewed in house and their water is even filtered so it doesn't taste gross. My favorite there is the margarita pizza. It's the only place I will order this.

This place is a joke these days. 2 years ago we were advised to take our IDs down to sign up so that we could reserve a Ramada spot at Kiwanis Park. We went down as we were new and did not register before and everything ran smoothly. We paid our $50 and was told our information would be in the system so we would not have to come back, we would just have to call to reserve other park ramadas.   Two years later I want to reserve another spot for my daughter's birthday. I call and they searched mine and my husband's information and can't find it anywhere. This leaves us to have to come to the office again and fill out paperwork. Unfortunately, we now live in Tucson but we're coming up where family is. I came to the office and was wondering if they would be able to put my information back into the system so when I get back home I could just call to pay over the phone. They advised me that this is not their procedure. I advise them I followed the procedure to the T 2 years ago and apparently they can't follow their own procedure now. I will no longer be renting any ramadas from Tempe.

The pizza is good but I've had better. There isn't a lot of parking in the direct area so you may have to park a bit off. Plus this place takes forever to make you food. We called for pick up. They said 30 minutes.  We waited 30 minutes and drove over as we are in the neighborhood behind them. Still had to wait another 15 minutes for our foid. Sheesh.

Not a bad place to go for a quick drink. Get in early because this place fills up really quick and it gets really crowded. Every time we go I can barely move around.   There Saint Patrick's Day party are great especially, if you have children. you can just sit outside and let them run around. The only downside is they do run out of corned beef hash quickly.

Best place ever. It's like taking your children to an aquarium without the extra cost. Huge fish to look at and even fish in a pond.   We see santa here every year. The cost is free but you can order more pics online.   We've bought some kids items here and they've held up very well.   They even have a restaurant upstairs that has kids meals.

We only go here for occasions And that's once in a blue moon. The music is so loud you can't even hear or talk to anyone. And the sushi rolls are highly over priced for how small they are. It's also not often that you will get a good server that comes back to your table quickly. Sometimes we had to hunt someone down just to get another drink. The sushi also takes almost 45 minutes to get to your table, every time.

This is a nice outside mall. It's set up like a California mall. Great for spring but not any other time. There is also a splash pad for the kids. This is great for the hot season. I get my hair cut at Toni and guy and I've never had a problem getting there. Parking is a little ruff but other than that it's great.

Yeah I like this place for browsing. I can find craft items that I need that Michaels or other stores won't have. Unfortunately a lot of the bigger items that are super cute for my house are way too expensive. There is no way that I'm going to pay 30 something dollars for a tiny Eiffel Tower picture for my daughters room. Maybe someday when I become rich I'll be able to afford stuff at the store.

I love target! I just have trouble finding someone to actually help me. I went to the one on power and southern, I believe, to get the Taylor Swift CD for me and my daughter. the young girl in electronics was super helpful. she actually walked me up front to where they were displayed and everything. In all of my years going to target I've never had that happen.

Nice casual place. The owner is an artist so some of his pictures are up on the walls. Everything is very healthy. definitely good for a person who likes clean eating. Nothing is fried the omelette is even baked. They're toast is also homemade and very good. Definitely perfect for healthy people like myself.

We end up eating here often as it's close to home. We often get the pretzel twists which are huge and we often have leftovers because we want to actually eat our meal.   The $5 burger Mondays is great especially when you have kids who want one. I have had several of the salads and they're very good.   Unfortunately, the only thing I did try to eat one time, was the fish and chips and it was not good at all. Everything else I've tried so far including the meatloaf was done pretty well.

Great store. I'm not sure where the high price reviews are coming from. I bought 4 pairs of shorts for my son and two outfits for my daughter. They were very nice for the price. They were also name brand. The highest priced one was $3.99 which, is normal pricing for a thrift store.   It was very busy there. I had to smash my cart into some of hanging clothes in order for people to get by.   On the flip side, the cashier was very nice. Even one of the employees held the door when I came in and was very polite.  Maybe the store hired new people because they were great.

Thank you Anastasia!  I love my nails. I requested gel builder with gel polish, glitter,  and design. She was very acommadating.  She did different designs of the clover until we found the one that was perfect for me. She was also, very patient with my needs. I will come back for the amazing nails.

This place is a mess. I just put my three year old and my new born in this facility. I find the place to be very unorganized and messy. My sons class is always very hectic and messy. I have seen children running out of the class room including my three year old who followed his teacher chasing another kid. When I looked at the curriculum for the week it was dated two weeks ago. I asked were the current one was and was advised by the teacher that she has not received it and when she doesn't she just wings it. Really?   I drop them off so early that there is only one teacher in the infant room. She takes my daughter out of the room and walks around with her. I am not sure if this is regulation but what if she drops her or other kids touch her and get her sick.   The security door is crazy. it a has feature that keeps the door unlocked if someone is standing my it on the inside. It has a sensor that reads people standing on the inside so anyone can walk in. The director felt that this was ok as long as someone was up front. what if a parent was the only one up there and someone just walked in? that parent wouldn't know if they belonged there or not. very scary.     it seems that the teachers are just babysitters watching kids. Only reason I give it two stars is because the teachers are nice but that is about it.

My son was seen here. Lots of stuff for the kids to be occupied with, while waiting. They have a playground outside and a giant chalkboard inside. The wait time is kind of long but not uncomfortable. The doctors are great here. The front staff, not so much. They don't welcome you with a smile and pretty much want you to fill out the paperwork and let them get on with their jobs. I would still take my son here just for the doctor.

I had completely forgotten about this place until a person called and left a message on my husbands phone, a year and a half after we were invited for a graduation ceremony.   Let me just say that I was highly disappointed in the way this company runs themselves. My son received a small training at Maxwell preschool Academy. We were to go to the karate place for his small graduation.   When we got there my son, who was 3 at the time, was terribly afraid of the loud noise and echoes that the small room created. Mind you, he had just had tubes put in. Previously everything sounded like he was underwater so, this was a frightening experience with a newly hightened sound.   The children were to have a quick demonstration in front of all of the parents and then at the end they would receive their certificates. My son was too afraid to go up so I spoke with a young lady at the front desk. I wanted to see if I could get more information as my son seemed to really like karate, he just needed to get used to the noise.   She kept sidestepping my request for information and advised that he needed to do the class first, get his certificate, and then they would give us information after. I went back and sat down trying to convince my frightened child to go up front so he can get his certificate. Of course he refused and I would not push him further.   I went back up to the front desk several times to see if we could just obtained his certificate and get information. Once again she refused and advise that 3 year olds, by that time, know if they will like something or not and most likely he will not be in to karate or be able to do it.   I immediately, was disgruntled by her behavior as she doesn't know me or my child and shouldn't make assumptions of what someone likes or does not like.   We quickly packed up our children and left with no certificate in hand. I contacted my sons preschool and advise them what had happened and refused to ever go back to that karate place again.   Now, a year and a half later a gentleman calls us and leaves a phone number to enroll our son. A little too late for that one thanks.

Dr Jones is amazing. I have terrible prism and astigmatism issues. He has been the only doctor who has gotten my lenses correct the first time. I would recommend him to anyone especially, if they have difficult eye issues.  The staff is also amazing. Amanda, especially. They know exactly what needs to be done and how to do it.

Very good food. Great price for the amount of amazing food you get. Had the meat and potato pastie. Husband had the margarita pizza. It was a happy hour price and could have fed 4 people. The pretzel sticks were great too. Not too kid friendly, though.

Wen in on a Monday morning with my son. He had an ear infection and just needed them to confirm so we could get antibiotics.  The front office lady was very nice and accommodating. She greated everyone as soon as they entered. She was able to get us checked in quickly with only one person in front of us. He was checked out by the NP, letting us know he did have an ear infection.  I left out a star as the front office Girl accidentally charged my account for another day and had to cancel and recharge it. Also they mention that you can get medications in  office but did not have amocsacillon so we took the script to CVS.
