$10 cover, no hats, and they steal your ID.  How is this garbage still in business???

Eating this Green Chili burro, green chili enchilada style is like  winning the lottery 3 times in a row.  This has to be one of the greatest food stuff I had ever eaten in my life. Perfect blend of spice and all the other goodness.  Even when I burped it up, I wished for chunks to come up so I could re-eat it again.  If I could give it 12 stars I would! I need to quit my job and just live in their patio area and eat these until I die.  Cash only, open Monday - Friday, 9am - 4pm.

Still just as good to this day. That's why I am the Duke of this place. :-P  Green chili burro, enchilada style, with green chili on top. Crap, now I am salivating writing this, because I can smell it while I sit waiting for mine to get done.

Taste is still perfection, but they have definitely gotten smaller in size over the last several months. I drive down from Flagstaff for these delicious morsels, but this makes me question my sanity. Why o why?!

I had the Vegetable Pho and a glass of water.   --Price: Very reasonable, and about what I expected/hoped to pay. $5.50  --Food: It is not the best Pho I have ever had, but it was above average.  Decent amount of veggies BUT no tofu!!!  I still have to rely on Maxim for the greatest Veggie Pho (comes with tofu).  --Service: Very awesome. Soup was out before I could even let out my pre meal fart.  They consistently were getting up during their lunch meal/break to see how I was and to refill my water.  I will go back again when I do not feel like making the drive to Maxim in Phoenix.

Stop leaving your trash (menus) all over my house and property! I am going to start dumping all my garbage on your front door, because that's what you keep doing to me and the entire neighborhood!  Your food is crap and always will be crap. I've eaten live cockroaches over in South America that tasted better than your food.   Dead serious.

I think an unborn fetus is smarter than the people who work here.  Stay far away if you don't want to get the crappiest Taco Bell you have ever had.  Blah.

It was very good.  Chicken was tasty but a bit overcooked.  Waffles were phenomenal with a hint of cinnamon.  Mac and cheese was perfect along with the home-style fries.  I liked the fact they used mason jars for glasses. That is something I do at home also.   I am still wondering why people are putting up pictures of another location.  Check out my recent upload for what it really looks like outside. It is a tad scary but that just makes me want to investigate even further.   I expected it to be cheaper than it was. Oh well!

First time I had Pho in my life and it was Phocking Photastic!  The food is awesomely priced and very very good.  I got the Chicken Pho and threw in some siracha and hoison, it was borderline addicting.  The staff that waited on us did not seem to excited to do so. She seemed upset I wanted to split the bill in two, but oh well.  I will be going back again very soon for some more Pho!

Service may be less than par but the Pho is the best EVAR.  I have tried all the "Pho" places within 200 miles of my house in Tempe, AZ. (Trust me, I have a lot of time on my hands)  My skin tingles with joy when I eat their Veggie Pho.  Choose wisely.

All I know is that this haircut was awesome. Usually gay male hair dressers are the only peeps I will go near, but have no fear, this place has me covered.  I am going back DOS, I will update.   If it rules again, I will update from 4 to 5 stars.

I am not even sure what I ate, or if I really want to remember.    All I know it is below average just like the rest of the many greasy subpar Chinese places around here.  The worst is this: THEY USE STYROFOAM FOR EVERYTHING. Makes me sick to my stomach. I am tempted to give them 1 star for this reason.  Heck, they might as well go out and club baby seals while they are at it with all that styrofoam.

1st visit was okay.  2nd time I tried the "Spicy Hunan with Tofu", and it was probably the best  chinese with the perfect spice ratio.  Yummy!

Get a contact # on your website and you should get on restaurant.com and participate with their gift card program. Getting more exposure = more business...plus I would live there if you participated in it.

Good selection of sandwiches for a great price. The bread was very fresh and scrumptious. They also have the best pepperoncini!  The place was huge and clean.  I will be going back for more for sure.

Large and fresh, salmon nigiri!  Happy hour is awesome. Cheap seaweed salads and hot sake.  I love it.  Now I just have to get my own personal chopsticks they have.  PS. Great music there by the way.

I decided to visit, persuaded by all the yelp reviews. This was my first time attending this facility.  I was immediately confronted to see if I needed help sitting or with a menu.   To make a long story short, all the positive Yelp reviews are spot on.  I had the Spicy Veggie Asiago and I nearly creamed myself with joy.    I am a picky m*ther fu*ker when it comes to my food, but I was very pleased in every aspect.  GO EAT HERE NOW!

From my one time visit......  Person who took my order spoke less English than a Swahili immigrant. It was annoying.  Food was luke warm and the string beans were very wilted.  Only good part was the awesome Mt. Dew they had on tap.    I would advise a different Panda Express.

I simply love the coffee here. I walk in and they always know exactly what I want... iced coffee (I then add cinnamon and raw milk), and it's smooth as silk.   Prices are very reasonable, coffee is consistent and they play coooool jams.   The staff is really cool too. :D

Very decent and affordable.  If I could give it a 3.5 I would.  I got the "green chile con carne, enchilada style" burrito. Had a decent spice to it, sufficient meat but the cheese was a little sparse.  I got this exact burrito to compare it with my favorite place, Ritos Mexican Take Out. Ritos is still in a league of its own, so back there I go.  Go try it out though, it's worth a shot.

Above average Pho. The chicken they use is kind of grizzly and nasty in my opinion.   Establishment is super nice and clean.  Awesome atmosphere without a doubt.  BIG BONUS: lots of hot Vietnamese women working in the kitchen.

Went in and could not decide on two different brands of dog food.  I received two very generous sized samples of Evo and Orijen 6 Fresh Fish.  After deciding to buy the Evo and use it for a week, my dog had mad diarrhea and was vomiting. They let me return the used dog food for a FULL refund and so I purchased the Orijen.  Since buying the Orijen, my dog's stools have never been more perfect and there is no more vomiting.  There was no extra cost involved for me to try various foods and find the right one.  You cannot get this service from anywhere else!  Love this place!

It was a very decent place. (I still live/die for Ritos)  --Price:  It was $6.99 for my burro.  For its size, it was about average.  --Food:  I had the Oaxacan Black Mole Burro. I was good, but not mind blowing.  I would say it was worth the visit.  --Service:  Alright I guess.  I could take out my balls, rub them on the table, and the waitress would never know.  Take what you want from this.  I read so much about the chips and salsa: Chips sucked my shaved anus but the salsa was good.  I had better at Costco. **Strawberry salsa was good**  Overall it was a good experience (hence the 4 stars), but I will continue giving my money to RITOS.

Just go here, now. I really mean it.....go.  Real Scandinavian folk, homemade and insanely good food.  Be prepared to wait a bit for your food. Each dish is made to order so enjoy some good conversation in the mean time.

I hate giving places such horrendous reviews, but each and everyone deserves it -- they honestly do not seem to care about customers or their satisfaction.  I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1, simply because they play all the UFC PPV's and only charge a cover for the huge profile events.  They also have an enormous amount of giant TV's. Yah for that!  Now the negatives:  1) My friend ordered a Guacamole burger, cooked medium (he even made sure to state the Guacamole part firstly and lastly) - they forgot the guacamole and it was cooked to a rubber crisp. Couldn't get ahold of our waiter to fix it.   2) I got garlic fries (which I have ordered from this waitress before), and they came out with the wrong variety of fries! The menu even states shoe string and not curly fries.  When I asked about the curly fries, she lied DIRECTLY to my face and said that they have ALWAYS used curly fries. WTF, seriously?! Shady crossed eyed woman.  3) They stopped carrying Guinness on draft (which was unknown to me). I ordered one expecting draft, but the waiter brought out a can with a WARM glass fresh from the washer.  Thanks for telling me it was in a can before hand, NOT, and thanks for the piss warm glass to pour my non-draft Guinness in, NOT!  4) Just to keep this rant to a minimun, here is the last thing.  My friend  tipped $X.XX amount for the bill.  He just checked out his credit card statement and guess what, THE WAITER CHANGED WHAT HE TIPPED AND FILLED OUT AN AMOUNT SHE WANTED.    I hope this place burns. I rather see another crummy McDonalds here than a place that commits CREDIT CARD FRAUD.  That felt good to get out of my system and keep this in mind the next time you decided to try and visit this place.  Check those credit card charges from this place, they are criminals.

I have nothing but great things to say about Oyo Yogurt!  The staff was extremely nice and helpful in every way. I was fortunate enough to meet the owner, and she couldn't be any more awesome.    Now the good stuff, the yogurt.  I've tried almost all, but I keep coming back for the vanilla. It's thick, creamy, and super vanilla-eeeee! Oh yeah, they also have sugar free yogurt, with Stevia. How cool is that!  The fruit toppings were super fresh, juicy and plump full of goodness! Yummmmmm!  Pricing was cheaper than most other yogurt shops I visited, which is a bonus for sure. It's only 42 cents/ounce and they have it listed on the giant 42" screen, you can't miss it! With that said, I can fill up the cup nearly exploding, and it only comes out to about $5-6...you can't get that at most other yogurt shoppes around here or Scottsdale for that matter.   Lastly, the place was spotless.  It's super modern, has clean decor and its right next to that cool fountain.   Go try it out! :)
