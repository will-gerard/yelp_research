Dude. Seriously. Good eats. I like fast cars, fast women, and fast service. Honey Bears is just that. Err, i mean.. Whatev. The ever-so-popular BBQ Pork Sandwich was the juiciest its ever been today. Add the seasoned fries and wash'er down with the RC Cola with crushed ice. I say "Damn, son." Ima fixin' ta look at dem ribs ya'll talkin' 'bouts.  I turned southern all of a sudden.

I don't know what it is about this place. It smells like my Grandma's closet, the clientele are questionable and none of it makes a bit of damned sense why I keep returning. Besides their beer selection putting a twinkle in my eye and the menu making my heart stop. I find it endearing to post up and get crunk on the patio overlooking Central Ave.  I took a first date here, she enjoyed herself and I got a goodnight kiss that night. He shoots, he scores! Maybe it was just the booze talking.  Nevertheless, it's definitely my default. Since its within walking distance, "G&D" is sent in a mass text message on any of the 6 nights I drink.

The ROK is simply, sexy. If you really want to make an impression head downstairs. It's like a speak-easy atmosphere with friendly bartenders. I went 2... make that 3 nights in a row. Yes, it's that scrumpthicous (I know its not spelled that way, but when your tongue is sticking out from drooling, thats exactly how its pronounced). Nice!  The menu is tip-top. Go with the small plates, they're fun and deee-lish. The music is played by an ibook/ itunes and I even heard Pete Rock & CL Smooth. That brought me back to ....92? Rad! Take Chris C's advice. You can totally make out with someone here. Flawless.

The sign reads "Lounge" above the door. I knew I found a gem some 4 years ago. This is what it's all about. Truly dope. It's tasteful to the likes of going in to relax by yourself for a quick drink or poppin it off with friends..... Yea, it comes with a pricetag, but you get what you pay for.  It's not try-hard by all means. It's consistent and reliable for every visit.  Cheers!

WTFriggz!!! Actually, this place is obnoxious if you go alone for your first time... like Vegas.   Cool shit on the walls, old school Pac-Man or is it Centipede?? Now you get to stand in line like you're getting ready to ride Goliath at Magic Mountain. Today I gave my order to the head-cook. No! You don't pay yet, go over there and stand in line again... Ok, now you pay before you wait yet again for your lunch to be called out, first name basis. Your deliciousness comes served on a pizza tray. Why? Im sure Valley Pizza is looking for these.  Awww-shit! They have Barq's Cream Soda!!!  Ya know when you sat down to watch Alien vs. Predator and said to yourself "Man! This is going to be awesome!'  Then the feeling you get when the credits roll. Hamburger Works is nothing like that.

McGurkee's, Im going to make this short my new found friend....Mad deliciousness is over-come at an even more delicious price. It's got this weird Irish Pub thing going on, yet it's an Italian Sub Shop. I got the Super Sicilian  - $6.50/ whole or $3.45/ half. The toasted Kaiser sub roll is pretty full of goodness on its own. And have fun flagging down a parking place because if its full and Im pretty sure it's full of "local flavor" inside too. The place only seats 12.

SACKS should be called, "Have a yummy sandwich and surprise! There's a cookie too!" During lunch its filled with downtown Corporate America and our brains of the world from St. Joe's Hospital - its right across the street.  Look at this line!! Holy shit! Calm down! The order board is gynormous, so you'll know what you want as soon as you reach the register.  Well you better anyways. First timers, its kinda overwhelming. Take a deep breath, its just a sandwich.   Parking and seating might be an issue. Luck was on my side today. I might just hit the Casino now.... or take a nap.

PBR. Mad Dog 20/20. What??!! I was a witness to someone drinking Milwaukee's Best Light. Damn son. I guess if youre going to do it, do it cheap.  Get there early if you're going on Saturday morning for the game, it fills up quick. All in all, it is was it is. An Ohio bar, watching football, peeps getting sliggity sloppt. Most are still drunk from the night before. Makes for good people watching practice. Make friends with your neighbors when you find a seat. They could be from Ohio and a new person to be "besties" with.  Nice!! Thanks Mickey's, you rock... and roll.

Oh Scottsdale nightlife, how I love thee. Even though I treat you like a child with a divorce, coming to see you every twice a month on the weekends.  It would be nice that the dim lighting was turned up one more notch. It's obnoxiously way too dark. Shuffling through the crowd with the bar in sight its like that scene in Entrapment with Catherine Zeta-Jones. Yes, you know the one. Nice!!   Next, if you have anything to say save it or learn Navy Seal hand signs because it's almost next to impossible to have a conversation. So, discuss on where you're going to next before you go in.  Its just the weekend that this place sucks my left ball... the right one gets so jealous. During the week, they do their best impression of a Biltmore Lounge.

I could have stayed at the previous bar to see how much I could drink as fast I can, but I heard you make irrational decisions when drinking whiskey. Hence going to Mulligan's.  Thursday nights are perfect if you don't want to wait 20 minutes for a drink, make friends with the bartenders and try to pick-up 5.658s.  Also, they have Happy Hour from 5-9..1/2 off well drinks.... meh.

RA to me is what Dorsia is to Patrick Bateman. The sushi is "meh." and people go because it's trendy as fleck. I spent most of my experience at the bar, so It's halfway decent as in "Another Sapporo? Duh." (hence the 2 stars). That classic line "it is what it is" reeks.. To shed some light, it's a good spot to meet friends before you head to venue #2. I think the only authentic Japanese item in this place was my watch. Just sayin'.

yes, this is venue #2.... Its a great place to just relax, enjoy a beer balcony-style. Tempe is unique in a way that youre able to sit on a balcony above Mill Ave and watch the people and traffic below.  Im a huge fan of day-drinking... oh wait Im a huge fan of drinking. Especially if i can spit on people.

Yes, another gutted house-turned restaurant/ bar to no prevail succeeds. Yippie-Skippie.  It's walking distance from work, so thats 5 badass red stars right there. Then, I almost gave it 1 star thinking it was closed and realized that it is 112 out today and no one was on the patio. Who doesn't like sweat dripping on their Pastrami? And thats exactly what I had. Good shit. It ran me a little over 18 bucks for lunch with 2 Ambers.   Go ahead and take someone "out-of-town" aka Scottsdale, to show them the advantages of knowing places like this downtown.  To my dispair, with everything being "authentic", they had a sensored-run paper towel machine in the restroom. Weak sauce.

Dude, seriously?... Ive only been here for lunch, which is perfect. Tonight I popped my gal's CK Dinner Cherry. Its such a great trick at night. Great buzz, great patio. I had the Chelsea's Cheeseburger, which is $12. Yea, 12 bux for a Cheeseburger and Fries, thats so money. Check out the fish tacos too. There's definitely something about this place that keeps me wanting more.... and its not the parking.

Oh Lenny, you're so smart. You probably have a 4 million dollar chateau on Camelback Mountain because of this place. Its an -effing GOLDMINE!  Your basic sloppy-but delicious burger joint. 50s garb on the walls. It looks like its wrapped in tin foil. Great spot for lunch. I think it's outstanding because I just happened to "forget my wallet" and someone "got me." Also too, (haha).... it's busy, busy. A great buzz inside of happiness. In addition of the record breaking 2 minute wait for your magical feast during lunch hour its hella cheap son.  Grab plenty of napkins. Yes, you will be making a mess. Then, make friends with people around you. Seating and space is minimal. You may be sitting on the IT guy's lap.

Bar Smith, you mediocre bar my friend. There's 3 good things I liked about you on a Saturday night. 1. 4 of us got in for the price of 1 because cover charging makes no sense ($7), 2. You played Wu-Tang, son and 3. Rooftop bar. The 3 things I didnt like, 1. You're extremely way too dark when there's an abundance of latina juiciness all throughout the main (hip hop) floor. 2. Bathroom attendant, why? 3. Put my drink in a rocks glass, not a plastic SOLO cup. Head to the roof and you're a cool, compact club scene. Almost too compact, especially when you have breakdancers taking up the joint. Check it out if you're scratching that uncontrollable itch called herpes.... I mean Old Town Scottsdale.

Radio you totally fulfilled my every desire. The chalkboard daily specials are the way to go. It was my night to get your short-ribs in ravioli topped with an egg over easy. Fucking magical son. Have fun drinking because the bartender makes a stiff pour. I think he liked me. So get krunk have an egg over some bomb ass ravioli and make out with your date. If you cant make out there, walk over to Postino. Youll be sure to get some after that.  Dont complain about the parking. Valet that son-of-bitch. Its an added service, use it.

Suite 301, you're still that crappy bar that resided there before you (aka Owls Nest). So much to offer with no effort, yet they cant accomplish this perfect canvas. This place would be super dope if they would have done it right.   *Sidebar: Keep the beefy chicks off the brass poles. Thanks.

Welcome to my new abode, the Pavilions on Central. Besides the lack of obnoxious children. There's much more to like about the Pavilions. It's quiet at the times it's supposed to be. I don't have bass-thumping-subwoofer guy or high-heels-on-hardwood-floor girl living above me and It's walking distance to Lux! Lofts, garages, hardwood floors and the sexual appealing gas fireplace, which is much needed only when you put your air conditioning at 50.   If the damned Light-Rail construction would ever get complete I've got a pick-up/ drop-off area right in front on Central Ave and there's a pick-up/drop-off area on Central Ave/ Roosevelt. Perfect for my intoxicating evenings at Fate, The Lost Leaf or/and The Roosevelt.  Drink up! Ride the train! Score!

It only took 1 suggestion, to make out with Sens. Yup, Im THAT easy.  The tapas was good shit and their sake list was ridiculously long (thats what she said). Argh!! I still felt hungry after the Volcano thingie and Wontons though. I should have left a personal item on purpose just so I would have to go back and see Sens again.  Its a good spot to take a date, drink sake and make out with them in the bathroom.

yea, this place rocks me socks. I mean, I wanted to go somewhere to watch "the game", oh yea, you know the one. Youre basically on top of TVs looking down. Dig it son. Garage door Postino style to open the outside. Hot bartender chicks. Hogaareden on tap. Teriyaki Wings. Actually I think Im still drunk. Just take my advice and check it out. i have good taste. Believe me.
