Awful. The worst customer service I have EVER experienced! I didn't even stay to get to try their drinks and food. I picked this place to try out for lunch/smoothie from Groupon. She was friendly at first then became extremely rude when I said I had a groupon. My total was $7 my groupon was for 10. I asked what was under $3 to get close to the 10 and she said, "nothing". There were plenty of things right in front of me for under $3 once I looked around. She walked away and when I made my selections she said,  "you're going to have to wait". I was the only one there. Then I gave her the groupon on my phone and she said, "it's already been used". I have never been there and am new to the groupon thing so I did not know what the problem was and she offered no help saying, "how am I supposed to know you just bought that?" I said that I just did and I left my office when I got the email saying it's confirmed. She did not during this time even attempt to start my drink and she pulled the other items away from my reach. I was dressed in nice clothes and I don't know if that's a bad area or not because I go through Mesa from Scottsdale to go to and from work. I was treated like a thief. I've never been treated so bad. Don't know if their smoothies are good. I left before addressing the groupon problem because I was so uncomfortable and I will address the problem with groupon and definitely get a refund because I got 2 $10 groupons since its in my way home and thought it would be a good place to try. I will never set foot on their property again WORST experience ever.

I wanted a "drastic" change so I went to Samuel for the first time. I was afraid to have anyone I know cut my hair short because I've never had short hair. Samuel went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. I spent 7 hours at the salon getting hair, mani/pedi and brows from the girls next door. Samuel at Puzzles was great with my hair! Best haircut I have ever had and I have gone to some of the best in LA and NYC. I'm so glad I found him! I will go back from now on for sure!
