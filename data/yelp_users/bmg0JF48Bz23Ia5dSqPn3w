This store is great, especially since they added fresh vegetables, meat, and a full grocery section.

They close all the checkout lanes every night around 10pm and force everyone to use self-checkout. Some people aren't really bright enough to use these and the lines get very long. The place is dirty and the Target in the same shopping center is a much better choice, and Target has grocery now.

So I was having a root canal surgery done at the ASDOH and a transformer fire happened that knocked out the whole area for a few hours or more. The rest of my root canal was performed with compressed-air driven drills and battery-powered flashlights. Note that the picture was taken before the power went out.  Thanks goes out to the Hemophilia Association of Arizona and the Hemophilia Treatment Center at Phoenix Children's Hospital for putting together a dental program for Hemophiliacs in Arizona in need. The surgeon at the Arizona School of Dental & Oral Health was highly competent and knew exactly what he was doing, and said he had even done a root canal by flashlight before. I am very impressed with the skill and the patient care at this facility.  this review is also on my blog at http://www.joshed.info/

They have one of the best burgers in town for the right price. The bacon is bacon bits instead of real strips. Anytime I can make it there before it's closing time I do, all too often I show up and they left early to cater something or because they felt like closing. For the bacon and the early closing time I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

I go to Five Guys all the time. I like the regular fries and my girl likes the cajun. We asked the cashier and they were very nice and let us know you can order some cajun seasoning on the side and apply it to your liking. Hope this works for you!  Five Guys is the best! I used to think In-N-Out Burger was the bees knees but my opinion changed as soon as I was introduced to Five Guys. Anyone who is unsure about a new chain in this area should really take a friend (or two) and try it. You won't regret it!
