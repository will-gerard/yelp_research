Houstons has the best service I have seen anywhere, at any restaurant. That alone is worth going for. If you go around 4:30 on the weekends, there is no wait. The sushi combo plate is fantastic. Best sushi I have ever had in my life. Really. That's just the appetizer. THEN I order the grilled seasonal fish and veggies, always good. Ask them to go light on the butter and oil. And get a side of string fries. They are amazing! Also great is the Grilled Chicken Salad...put the fries IN the salad. You will LOVE it! The chicken is like butter. And my hubby always gets the cheese toast although it is not on the menu and the filet (always perfect) and baked beans.  My only complain is they don't have a happy hour. They are too good for that I guess. That's a bummer. Service here is like none other though. The best!

This place has turned me off of Cuban food. Terrible decor, old, hot, not enough air conditioning I guess and the Paella..please. Over cooked, smooshy, cold vegetables, almost all rice with no saffron favor ands terrible seafood...can't even get the crab out of crab legs because they are so soft and cold. Terrible. I hope this place goes out of business because at these prices...I wouldn't normally say that but...shame on you for serving this. These other reviews are from the staff, no doubt about it. Try it and then thank me,later for warning you.

I LOVE this place! Best Gyros, hot dogs and their home made zucchini are amazing! Not one speck of grease on anything! It looks scary on the outside but it is very clean and well taken care of!

I am done with this vet. The front staff are horrible, the never remember who we are, they don't treat the dogs like family members but more like cattle. When my husband took out chow mix in for a allergy shot, She was excellent as always in the waiting room and otherwise. He  the vet walked into the little room and Winnie barked ONCE at him. He jumped back like he never saw a dog bark before. He put a MUZZLE on my dog and didn't try to spend ANYtime getting to know her. He also told us that we needed to give her a bath for her allergies. These allergies she gets every March and April for her entire life, It is from breathing in spores. She doesn't need a bath. She actually gets one every other week, anyway. He has no idea what he is talking about. I called later and asked why he didn't just spend time with Winnie and instead put her in a muzzle and he said she COULD bite and would do it again. No compassion, no respect, no vet knowledge. I the past we brought in our very old dog and they said he didn't need treatment for his cough, we should 'just enjoy the time he has lefty'. We demand medication which I got and works very well and he is fine now. Our dogs mean everything to us.  Never again!

Overall:  I love this place!!! Its always crowded but its great for people watching! There are sloppy people, fancy people, athletic- just-got-off-my Cannondale bike-people, motorcycle people, old people, young people, famous people. You name it. The food is awesome, especially the homemade corned beef hash! Ask for a side of gravy!!!! Eggs are awsome. Husband LOVES their pancakse and crepes. Service is great. Servers look like older bike chics and they call you honey and darlin and I love that! Always topping off your coffee.   We are always stuffed after we go. You can sit outside with your dogs. The place is not fancy at all and looks like they decorated using everything from a couple garage sales (which they probably did)but I just love it.  They are famous for their German Pancakes too. They could give you more than one sausage with the Sunshine plate but oh well. I love it.  PS They are always taking collections for the owners dog that needs eye surgery but I have a feeling they have been collecting this money for some time now and if the dog needed surgery, she better of had it by now!! Afterwards go visit Elvis the camel and his friend,! Drive west on carefree highway, make a right on 7th Ave, and go a few blocks until you see the camels on your right. Feel free to park and go pet them and say hi!! The owner doesnt mind at all, just dont feed him. Camels have sensitive stomachs! Unlike me!!!

Excellent food, we like hot and it was hot enough, hubby had hot as you can make it s&s chic and I had tofu curry with veggies. Great service, I really liked the decor compared to some places(you guys complaining want to pay more for your food?)...had nice music playing,open on Sundays which is rare for Thai places and the desserts...homemade green tea ice cream with wrapped and fried bananas was great! ONLY COMPLAINT WAS NO BROWN RICE. PLEASE GET SOME! 4 stars JUST for that. Place was packed at 12:30 on a Sunday and server and hostess did an outstanding job! WE WILL BE BACK SOON. Hubby wants me to go get take out tonight! Also, not that bad a neighborhood. Come on people! This is where the REAL food is at! Also love variety of soups and you can get small bowls for around 5 bucks. Usually they are just huge ones for sharing and hubby doesn't like soup. Next time that's on my list...

SEAFOOD LOVERS!!!!!!!GET THE CHILI CATFISH and add seafood and extra vegetables. Probably the most wonderful thai food I have ever had in my life. Their catfish is like no other. Lightly breaded and super tender. And so many vegetables. Oh. My. God. I still wish they would serve brown rice tho.

I agree with everything being told here. But what is the alternative endo??? I have pain hundreds for thyroid tests and other ultrasounds. Nothing is wrong. There was not even any warrant for having these procedures done. Oh, but I can get some Botox!

This is my favorite restaurant and I am a major foodie!! I always get the Pescatora w/ Jumbo Shrimp, Clams,Mussels and Calamari, served over Linguini   $18.95 and it is HUGE!  But I get it with the Lemon Wine sauce. I love the Seafood salad too!Desserts are fantastic, including the Bread Pudding and Creme Brule. Breakfast is really good too! Staff  remember us, including chef!. My mom and hubby LOVE their Pizza more than any other pizza they have ever had. Something about the cheese...

Never again. My husband brought me food home the first time. He told me they got food off the buffet but I didn't realize the buffet was closed! It had just been sitting there. Well, this time, they did the same thing. Hubby's plate was dirty and he told them ( the place had 2 other tables on a Friday night) and the lady took it and walked over to paces and washed it with a dirty rag she was cleaning with and then gave it back to him! We bought samosas ( served over a tiny big of ragged brown white lettuce) and three other meals plus rice. After the Appetizer, when we asked for a new plate, the English lady said "we don't normally do this but okay" . THANKS! And they don't give free refills on any drinks, even coke and iced tea! I spent almost 60 bucks there, paying extra for rice and nan bread. The food was good but I hope u go under just like the place I heard the English lady ran before. You deserve to go under. U don't know how to treat your customers. I wish I wouldn't have given you a tip. Shame on you. 60 dollars for that service. Goodbye.

Absolutely LOVE the food. They get 2 stars for this.Service and cost are rediculous though. Owner: You  are going to lose your business if you don't start working on this.  We used to come often then quit when the service was soo slow and bad. Just bad. Didn't get coffee right away, everyone looks stressed out and disorganized. They nickle and dime you with 3 slices of bacon (really small too) for 4 bucks! and extra for bread too. Then the service got better. They hired different people. Damage control people. Now its back to the way it was. 2 weeks ago we ate outside and after someone else brought us our food, we NEVER saw our waitress again. This weekend it took an hr to get our food and our waitress had lost someones change and she was throwing things behind the counter and looked ready to cry. I was so stressed out when I left there, I said no, not again. Besides that, they said the toast would now come with the Crazy Cowboy (it did 2 weeks ago)b and last week they charged 3 dollars for it and gave my husband his 3 bacon strips and one was a half a piece. For 4 dollars. I know customers can be a pain but we aren't. We know what we want and I will even get up and get my own coffee. Tip: Give everyone their own coffee and water for the table and get organized. And smile like you are happy to be here! We do have choices of other places to go. Especially when breakfast costs us 40 dollars every time my husband and I  come here! And we aren't ordering anything special!

Back to 5 stars again! Went again and service was perfect. Is it just hit and miss? Were they just not the busy? Or are they making changes? I will be back!

We went here for the first time for lunch today. It is a great area with the outside patio right up front. We rode our bikes there and they had a small space for them. The patio is great, the food was great (I had biscuits and gravy plus 1 egg with sides of fruit and potatoes. They could have used more gravy buit that's because I am a pig!) My friend had the egg white veggie wrap and she loved it!). The water has a cucumber with appeals to me for some reason. The service was fantastic!! And this was noon on a Friday  in downtown Scottsdale, which is always packed on that day and time.  So they must have read all these other reviews and said "WTF!" We need to step up the service! Each of our bills came to under 9 bucks without tip. Biscuits and gravy without egg would have been 6.95. Compared to The breakfast Club, this place gets FIVE stars. Compared to my favorite place in Cave Creek, Oak Creeks Diner and Flapjacks, it gets 4 stars.  Will definitely go again!

The new, if she is 'new',  she introduced herself as new, deli cook is AMAZING. They take things from the produce section and make wonderful recipes! The kale salad with watermelon radishes that most people don't know what do with, with this tarragon dressing, out of this world! And fish tacos,  and salmon with crab! And Parmesan potatoes and baby broccoli,  on a Friday night and have fun! Ty! She is the best chef...should be working at AJs if nothing else. We are lucky to have her.

I loved this place! My only beef is that they use styrofoam! 4 stars for that.  It's 2013 and we know what it does to the planet. It never Leaves! Otherwise , my hubby loves teriyaki and I love sushi and I think it was wonderful. The girl in the front was very nice,all the condiments were available at a all you want bar and the sushi was very fresh. It was a little expensive but it's Sushi! I can't wait to go back and try the noodles and croquettes!

Best Vet office ever! Very flexible in terms of bringing dog in for regular shots and getting other dog pain medication without seeing them ( they see them often already but do not nickle and dime us for every vet visit. Excellent service and they are very kind to our kids.

I don't even care for sweets and I am ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED to the Oatmeal Cookies. Americana is awesome too and the Baristas know what they are doing! Can I get a free extra punch for this review! LOL! I'm addicted to getting my punches too! NEVER got coffee so much in my life! Fair price, too!
