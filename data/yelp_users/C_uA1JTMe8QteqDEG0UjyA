I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work, and I must say that the first time I was there, the service was slow and the food mediocre.  The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.  About 5 people I work with have all sworn to never return to this store.

Honest people who do honest work. Fair prices and George the owner is always there to answer you questions. They stand behind their work 100%.  I trust my mom and sister's cars here, there is no one better.

This is a little, local owned store that pales in comparison to other local owned stores.  Having had reptiles, fish and birds my whole life, I would never buy anything from the wild, and this place has a reputation for having cheap prices because of the low quality of their animals.  I have found wild caught animals in this store repeatedly.  I have also seen animals very improperly housed, along with feces in the cages. I have also had a conversation with the owner who was dropping some very racist bombs into the conversation about our current president and anyone who speaks multiple languages.   It seems that all of the knowledge they have is only gained from elementary readings and minimal experience.  Their fish selection looks as though it was an old Walmart setup, which means if one fish is sick, they are all sick. It is hard to tell people not to support a family owned business, but with a racist husband and a lady that never moves from her stool behind the counter but has an attitude on her, and with experiences as described above, it gets somewhat easier to tell you to go to another store.  It is worth it to drive to another pet store that does not support taking animals from the wild, does not hire weirdo's, and has a less "racist" staff.  I know of another reptile store at Bell and Cavecreek that has a much, much better selection.

Great place, highly recommend the Philly cheese steak with extra cheese. Only problem is some days it's stacked, others it's way too light.

This place is good depending on what you're looking for. I'm going to write this from a reptile enthusiasts' view. Simply put, this place is the worst. Animals all housed improperly, I've seen some snakes that were rescued from here, it smells, and it has been this way since the 90's. If you're looking for reptiles, avoid this place!

This is the second time I have been here and not been able to finish my food.  The first time the omelette was super dry, and the second time there was so much grease that my stomach hurt before I could finish my food.  Service has always been slow, will never go back!

Pets Inc is one of the best specialty pet stores in the valley. Their prices are pretty expensive, especially for their reptiles and plants (considering that most is from local suppliers), but it is still one of a kind and a great local business that we should all support! And the staff might all be stoners,  but they do know their stuff and are super friendly (every once in a while you meet a retail know it all, but not too often).  Definitely a place for fish and reptiles, only a minute selection for the fuzzy animals.

Never have I been in a more crowded, dusty, smelly pet shop in my life. They say some treasures should remain hidden, and I think this is one best left that way.  I have never met a knowledgable employee in this store, and I have never walked out thinking 'that place was clean'.  On the contrary, I have seen dead fish in the tanks, two foot monitor lizards in 8" cubes.  I have found that they are grossly overpriced, and the service leaves much to be lacking.  They seem to prey on the uneducated consumers who come in, as anyone who knows anything about reptiles or fish is left without a salesman, because they are afraid of actually learning something.

I lived in Mexico for six years, and I have to say this place has some of the worst Mexican food I've ever tried.  I've had better Mexican food in Hong Kong!!!  The waiters are slow, and leave a lot to be desired in terms of manners.  The food tastes like nothing more than grease with cheese.

Best selection and good prices!  Can find all the stuff from Thailand, including a lot of the more rare and unusual meats.

Awesome, friendly people and really great tamales! Would be five stars if I could eat there, as everything is take and bake.

Scramble is a breath of hip air in the otherwise mundane north valley.  It adds a bit of flare with it's college hip atmosphere (although at times thrown off by the families and senior citizens, but hey....they're all cool too!) into the border of Sunnyslope and Moon Valley.  The food is a wonderful fusion of classic/southwest and it is all as healthy as it can be (come on, how healthy can sausage and loads of butter be?).  If you sit out on the patio, your reward will be a beautiful of Sunnyslope with the mountain preserve as your backdrop, and a nice sunrise to lighten the whole thing up if you make it early enough.  Definitely one of the best breakfast/brunch places in the North Valley.  Hopefully this catches on..............

Good beer, good cigars, and good people. I live in the north valley, but this place is worth the ride!

I used to live in Thailand, and this is one of my top choices when I'm on this side of the ocean. Friendly people and the most authentic Thai food I've found in Phoenix.

I have been going here for years and now I'm done.  Recently, it seems the post office had a spike in prices, and the staff which is usually nice to me, had a new lady there I've never seen who was so rude, and offered absolutely NO HELP!!!!  She wanted to charge me $50 to mail two pounds of papers from here to Missouri overnight.  That was outrageous, and when I look online, the cost is $30, at the high end, and in the express envelopes (which she never told me about), it's only $20.  She ended up charging me $12, and online at USPS, it appears the charge is closer to $5.    I've also had issues with them and international mailings.  They don't provide papers anymore, instead they have a notebook computer that should have graduated high school by now and barely functions anymore to print papers for customs.  At the post office, it' just business as normal, with no need to print papers and bring them in or any hassle.    This place used to be the best, but now it just seems like they don't care, they don't help, and it's frustrating.

The place is cool, the food is good, and the girls are pretty, but my only draw back is there is only one poorly lit pool table!!!!  One thing I have to say is it feels like a strip club, but without the nudity.  The girls are very nice and talk with you until you get the food, then they kind of hang out at the next table until they order, neglecting the previous table.  Sometimes it takes a while to get refills or whatever else you want after your meal has arrived.

Don is super nice and has a great selection. Every time I go there he always talks and wished me a safe journey on my motorcycle. All the guys that hang out there are cool and welcoming as well. Great place!

Best tacos north of the border. I've spent years in Mexico, and these are the only tacos I've had at a retail establishment in America that rival tacos I. Mexico. The flavor of the beef is so close to Sonoran beef I couldn't believe it!! Great guac and great prices too. Simple place with the focus on food.

I really want to keep going to this place, but they mess up every single month. I made a box for them to throw in all of the new Star Wars comics and all of the spinoffs into my box. Many people have boxes there, so I don't know if I'm the only one this happens too.   It's not difficult, match the customers name with the comic they want and put it in the box. Well, since January they've only got it right once.  I've had them give me pushback saying just wait for second editions, but that defeats the purpose of reserving the titles when they are first released. There's always someone else's stuff in my box, or they just don't put it in, or they don't get it shipped to them.   It's hard to keep giving them chances after half a year of them not getting the simple task done of putting the correct comic in the correct box. I even ordered a $25 graphic novel that never arrived and was never mentioned to me after the order. Oh well, hope others have a more positive experience.

The pizza crust was really soggy when I got it, and the specials were ok.  I love my pizza, but I just didn't catch what made this place any different than other pizza place.
