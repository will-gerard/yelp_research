Very friendly atmosphere. First time I've been offered bottled water by every employee. All the other people in the waiting area notice it too... Everyone is smiling in here. It's great. :)

This holiday inn had a quaint Victorian style, and was quite possibly the best furnished one as well!  It even had a chaise lounge, and a fully furnished living room. Friendly staff, and located directly across from the ginormous Fountain hills fountain, that spouts on the hour. Prefect!

I went to the Rumbar for the first time yesterday and I was not disappointed. The bar staff was the epitome of mixology. I could have spent a few hours watching them expertly craft drinks alone.  They have one drink (The Shorty) that requires lighting a sage leaf on fire then covering it with a glass to add smoke flavor to it. Pure genius! Whomever came up with these recipes...  I applaud you.

This place is horridly disgusting. After getting a cup of egg drop soup, it was discovered  there was SOAP in the soup. I alerted the management, and had to deal with a less than competent man (the owner) with limited public relation capabilities. I sincerely felt sorry for their poorly treated waitress, who apologized over the manager. To add insult upon injury, the manager refused to remove the infected soapy soup from the buffet & STILL SERVED IT TO THE PUBLIC FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. Gross & distasteful

Ok, so it's been a while due to lack of customer service, and guess what? It strikes again.   First, our order was messed up. Ok, they fixed it, but only after struggling to find someone else since our server mysteriously vanished.  Then, we tried to order some more drinks. Where did our server go? Oh, I see him. I made eye contact, and got ignored. I made eye contact and waved at several people, still no service. After finally getting a response (from the 4th person) our drinks are ordered. Do they come? No. Does the guy sitting next to me who ordered the same drink after me get his first? Yes.  I then went to the owner, who tried to tell me that there were only 2 servers working. As someone who has been a server and restaurant manager for 10+ years, I notice everything in the restaurant.  Everything. Especially the fact that there were 5 servers, 3 bussers, 2 managers, and when I'm being blatantly ignored and lied to. After talking to the owner and explaining all of this, his response was, "what do you want me to do about it?" Really? That's the response? I was appalled. I said you could work on customer service & satisfaction, he did give 2 Thai teas, but with much dissatisfaction and making me feel like an unwanted customer the entire conversation.

I honestly was not impressed. I ordered the chilli relleno. The dish seemed pre made & reheated. I thought that it was strange when I asked for it with no onions and they said it couldn't be done.... Because it was already made.  I'm really sad because this was supposed to be my special birthday dinner. :(

Keith H needs to get his panties out of a twist. Do not let his one star rating fool you, this place is a gem.

Seriously, so so so so so (did I mention so?) delicious. Everything from okra, baked ziti, chicken, and pies. Best delivery ever.

*sung to the tune of "Hello" by Adele*  Hello? Can you hear me? I'm in Arizona dreaming about eating cheesy pizza. I want it, so bad but you never called me back...  Hello to pizza patron, You put me on eternal hold.  Then leave your phone off of the hook, I know for sure because I took a look.  then you never came back on the line, or picked up when I called back. I just don't get it, why would you do me like that?  Hello to pizza patron, I really tried to order by phone... Still you don't answer for me any more. :'(
