Went here with group of friends for dinner.  Waited for a long long time - 90 min.  (granted. my fault not making a reservation).  I cant say it for my friends, but I feel it was worth the wait.  I wanted to try this place because it says its the best pizza in arizona.  Two pizzas I enjoyed the most were Combo and Mama Spinato's pizza.  Right in the middle between soft and crunchy, just right amount of cheese, and savory taste.  Service was great even though we were eating at the balcony.  Definitely will come back

Food qty is always huge and quality is good.  The place itself is not the most pleasant to look at.  It might need some remodeling.  Luckily I never have gotten sick so far from this place.

John and Barbie are very friendly staff since the first day I met them up to now.  They are also very understanding individuals.  I have a downstair neighbor complaining about me walking around my apartment at 10pm (and who threatened to call the police on me.....yeah laugh about it).  Instead of being judgmental, they took both sides of the explanation and went from there.  Obviously it could have been worse for me.  Having said that, I do agree with the previous comment about the way that Sun Creek is built.  Another reason I like living here is the noise.  There is not always very noisy around the complex.  I don't however agree with the theft comment.  The neighbor should have at least some common sense that they should lock their apt when they are or not at home.  Also, car thefts in AZ are common; it is not just in Sun Creek.  Finally, there is a security guard around the complex at night.  For other future tenants, you can take mine or the previous individual's comments.

My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area.

My friends and I usually come here for happy hour, which I think they are pretty much famous for.  Food are good, especially the crazy boy rolls.  I am not too much of an alcoholic, but I would recommend the sake bomber since you get more bang for your buck.  Another good thing about their happy hour menu is the cost.  You pay $5 for 1 roll.  Where else can you get a regular sized roll for only $5. I believe they have 2 times each day for their happy hours: 3-5p and 8-close.

You think a local coffee shop should be cheaper and hopefully better than Starbucks.  Your guess is wrong.  It is equivalent pricing as starbucks and coffee bean.   They use to give student discount on all the items you purchased.  Starting almost 6 months ago, they only give d/c on purchases greater than $10.   I realize that starbucks always spelled your name wrong.  I am okay with that as long as they make the drinks right.  Next has the other problem.  Tell me if I am wrong, but I know blended caramel macchiato should have the espresso, milk, and ice blended all together.  They blended the milk and ice and dropped the shot of espresso on the top.  Since it is blended, I am drinking only the ice and milk first.  NASTY.  They made a mistake on my drink at least 75% of the time, and this is just one of the incidences. Manager is horrible.  I understand that you can tell customers they cant bring outside food and drink in bc it is a store policy.  This manager decides to tell me that it is a HEALTH VIOLATION for bringing outside food into the store.  i was like wtf?  Then she said this is not a study hall and I cant allow outside food into my store.  So what is it blonde? health violation or YOU dont allow outside food in?   Yeah, just lose another customer in the business also.  Starbucks and Coffee Beans I welcome you back.   btw, you know coffee beans also have free Wifi while Next needs you to purchase something in order to get their password for the Wifi. hint hint

I like this place a lot.  It is relatively cheap and even cheaper with the student discount.  The mango shrimp quesadilla is really good, and I would definitely recommend it.  The restaurant is clean, which is a plus.  The server is nice, which is another plus.  So, overall, i would recommend this place definitely.
