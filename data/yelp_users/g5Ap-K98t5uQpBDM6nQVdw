Yum, yum yum - I finally had a sandwich from here and my coworkers were jealous.  Which in all fairness I probably did on purpose.  I got the Market special and Friday a great day.    Bread is round and thin and charred, and I swear something had the perfect hint if saltiness.  I had turkey with slight chili sauce, fennel and squash puree with greens and provolone.  I am pretty sure Monday I got find some at work I can bribe with I buy you fly, although I don't think I will have to bribe.  I have been there once but was grabbing coffee and the place is chill, sit outside enjoy the day,  and price point dead on

I have been wanting to try Red Door for a while, the bold Red Door calling my name.  I have been to my fair share of Spas, but lean towards resorts when I am craving luxury.  Stick to old faithful for the bi weekly services.  Any who, I discovered Spa Week in the Valley and saw that Red Door was on the list of providers  I thought I hit the spa jackpot!.  I really was thinking that Spa Week was an awesome promotion, get your facial on week, but now I can't tell if it actually causes the spas to be lazy.  Premise of Spa Week, Spas offer 50 minutes services for $50, each place has a select 3 things they are offering.  I booked a facial with mircoderm and pedicure ($50 each service, microderm extra which is understandable), each service costing $50.  I showed up about 5 minutes before my appt. ( work ran late)  I stood there for about 10 mins, while the front desk had one person  sign in and out.  A couple other employees walked by but seemed to act too busy to assist.  Once completed and one person cutting in line, the front desk escorts me back with another customer, doesn't show us around and leaves me to show the other patron how to use the electronic lock ( used them at Joya :)    Facial:  I couldn't get mircoderm since I use an acid treatment regularly on my face ( must have 2 week break)  I got a 30 minute facial that was a makeup removal, execration and a face mask.  I got a week arm massage and it was over and not to mention cut short by 10 minutes, you do need to honor the 10 minutes I stood at the front counter.  Pedicure:  This on the other hand was painfully long.  I had asked the front desk to shorten and add a polish change so my nails would match ( I would pay extra)  When the nail tech came to get me, should told me she didn't know and didn't have time.  I am sorry, I don't know why, but the cultural cheaper nails places ( Andy's, Chic and Kens)  They know how to give a pedicure...They get down in there scrub it off and slap on some perfect polish.  I do expect a $20 massage on my feet in a $50 pedicure, not paraffin which I could drip a cancel on my foot.  This is basically what you are paying for.  Well as you can imagine that massage was lack luster as well.  The whole place was lack luster, small locker room and I am not even sure there was a steam room, I was definitely not shown around or told there was.    I give the Kudos on the Decor, the agency they hired at corporate did a great job.  However, I will not be going back, I fell so let down...I was so excited and the follow thru was just not there, but they did have time to plug some products.

I love this gym.  Hands down one of my favorites besides The Athletic club I went to in Kansas City.  I lived on 44th for 3 years before I joined, what a mistake.  First lets get the prices out of the way, it is expensive.  I got a special which I think may be pretty standard or always on special.  I paid $700 or $500 for sign up and I pay $137 monthly.  Were is does become great is family plan.  When my boyfriend was going ( gym on hold right now)  the dues were I think $160-ish.  Here is the catch though, it is not your normal gym.    Clientele - It is a gym that you can feel comfortable at.  It is fairly steady in the evenings and a bit busier.  They supposedly limit the number of memberships so that there is always equipment available.  Amenities -  Small Boutique - some trendy apparel, work out gear, and lots of tennis items Yoga, Pilaties and Aerobic studios - they offer a lot of classes, and have a pilaties reformer room as well, classes appear to be private and around $60 Salon and Spa - Full service Restaurant - Have not tried, does have outdoor sitting area with a fire pit and has a view of camelback  Free standing snack and juice bar - Have not tried, but looks good Basketball, Squash & Racket ball Weight Room Spin Room - BIG FAN, I love spin and they have a great room specially built for spin. Track Pool  Locker Rooms - are very nice, they offer everything you need to get ready.  You can rent a locker if you don't want to find one although I have never had a problem  Ice Cold Water - Available thru out the gym, I just bring a reusable bottle, but they offer cups and lids as well  There are actually a lot of the amenities that I have not tried at the Village and would like to this year.

Oh LGO what to do with you.  LGO is part of a corner on 40th and Campbell that the owner has managed to transform.  It is a self contained little village.  LGO Grocery being the anchor if the choices on establishments.  Perk - they offer curbside, and has a nice European feel to hit.  They offer specialty goods here and good at changing out the merchandise.  Quick run down  Beverages - nice selection in coolers.  One of the first to carry the orange and lemon San Pellegrino Wines - good selection and the prices are in line with other valley locations Cheeses - they do excel and the cheese selection along with homemade breads Coffee bar - a bit lack luster, I think it could be so much better if the baristas were passionate about it versus college students Pastries - both LGO creations creations and Tammy Coe Menu - is full of breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Simple and good, they also offer premade to grab and go  I stopped in yesterday for the pimento dip which I swear has crack in it.  I am not a huge pimento person and I ate this in one sitting.  I have had a variety of items  Homemade hash, All salads, burgers and most pastries.  I do think the LGO's pastries are better than Tammy Coe - I think the others use too much fondit.  The also offer amazing gelato both in the Grocery and the actual gelato store.    IT is a great neighborhood stop, you can chill bring your dog, have a cup of Joe.  Also, on a side note they always seem to be playing wicked music.

Andy's was actually referred to me by a friend about a year ago.  I ended up going because Sundrops was reservation only.  Andy's has GREAT prices and they are quite friendly.  The place is sparse but they have a ton of magazines.  Don't be fooled by the nail color selection there is another rack after the counter on the wall.  I I pay $33 for mani, pedi and callus remover, It is one of the best deals in town and the fact that they do a great job is a bonus.  Also, you can get your eyebrows waxed!!  Special thank you, I went in late on the Thursday and they had well closed, but still continued great service.  They did not speed up the Mani/Pedi to get us out.  This is what will make me a repeat customer

I have been frequenting El Pollo Loco for a couple years now.  It is a great quick option for something fast that is mildly healthy and low carbs (if you order right).  They recently went thru a renovation and really improved the interior.  Service is always prompt and friendly.    Menu is pretty basic, they have added items like tacos ect.  The tacos are very good but not healthy at all.  The main menu item of course is chicken and they offer a few choices of family meals with 2-4 sides.  I recommend the loco salad with the avocado cilantro ranch, yum, yum.    The chicken is not fried and is grilled but has a nice crisp to it, and served with corn or flour tortillas. You may doctor up with chopped onion, salsa and cilantro.  If you are in the area and need a quick dinner - Give El Pollo Loco a try

I was actually very impressed.  I had gone to discount tire in Tempe about 3 years ago and had remembered having to wait a while.  WOW, that has changed.  I book my appointment online for a Monday at 4:30.  I arrived on time and there seemed to be quite a few people.  I spoke to the rep and provided my name and that I had made an appointment.  I asked him how long he thought it would be and he said" because you made a n appointment no longer than 35 minutes."  I actually had me out of there in 30 minutes.    THey also had all the information saved from my previous visit 3 years ago.  It was nice that they knew the tires I had purchased before and how they held up.  Turns out they had one set left on a pair made for a Honda, he gave me a discount and the tire protector for free.  I had told him I really didn't want to spend over $500 and he made it all happen!!!!  I had looked at Costco and Sears, doing my research Discount tires does have the best prices and quality for the buck in the valley.  I am a sucker for good service, and for a tire retailer I have to say some if the best service I have had.  i would recommend Discount tire to anyone

Kai is truly a five star restaurant, and best in class in the valley for service.  I have to first address that some of the posts stating the decor does not feel 5 star.  I think with restaurants and the New American, Modern Cruise we expect the establishment to be hip and modern.  I think Kai is understated, it complements the food and the mood of the hotel.  The backdrop is a Native American resort in which Kai pulls their flavors.  The table clothes although a pale peachy pink of the desert, look closer and there thick silk.  I did not feel as though my table was to close to another diner.  More than often now in the ultra cool mod restaurants you are on top of your neighbor on a long bench.  Anyway, back to the food.  My boyfriend and I - which are self proclaimed foodies, went all out with the Journey with Expanded Wine List.  The way to go for the first timer.  Amazing, I cannot say enough.  My next visit I do plan to order directly from the menu.  However, in anyway restaurant I am a firm believer in getting the tasting menu is generally getting the best  All the dishes incorporate Native American cuisine, the grain, corn and tomato perfectly combined.  What I did find interesting in the wine list, was a cheese course of two different cheeses accompanied by two different beers.  Although not a beer drinker I appetite the cleverness.  As you are rolling yourself back to your hotel room, trying to remember all those courses and flavors, you approach the hotel room door and there lies a Thank you note with all the memories on paper for you.

I was pleasantly surprised by Lamps Plus.  We are currently remodeling our new home and needed new lighting for the entire home.  I had been checking out their website which is very extensive and had everything for every room.  I think if i really wanted to shop out each item I could find cheaper, but this place was really convenient.    We had been at the Great Indoors ( lack luster ) and didn't see anything.  This place was 2nd on our list.  We managed to walk out with 4 outdoor fixtures, Office light, 2nd bedroom light and 2 bathroom fixtures and all were really cool and offered some sort of design element.    I did find the store a bit overwhelming at first, but then slowly figure out the layout.  We just walked around and wrote the model number down, this makes checking out much easier.  Their service was good and friendly in fact we got HOOKED up big time and really appreciate what the sales rep did for us.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for lighting needs.  They also carry ceiling fans, mirrors and some carpets/rugs.  The selection is the largest I have seen in the valley when it comes to lighting.

I haven't been in a piercing store for a while. Actually probably close to eight years and prior to that another eight years.  Anyway, I had to remove dome piercings for surgery and made the assumption that I could put them back in at anytime.  Not True.  Hence bringing me to Halo.  I was impressed; it appears to be women owned and the assortment of jewelry in amazing.  They offer some amazingly feminine earrings, belly rings etc.  I pick up 22K gold and diamond nose ring and some beautiful rose gold and horn earrings (pic uploaded).  Pros: I thought that everyone was extremely friendly; the place is on point with cleanliness, knowledgeable, fantastic jewelry selection, customer service.  I also think it is interesting to see female dominated store versus my experience 18 years ago. Customer Service was great.  They actually have a no return policy (which makes sense) but the earring I bough I had not gotten to worn and the horn carved piece fell out.  I was able to swap them out and get a small upgrade because they were out of my particular style.  This alone and the select will have me going back.  I love that they offer designer jewelry and items in real gold.    Cons:  I knew I was going to be purchasing a couple things; I wish I could have paid in the end.  Instead I ended up running my credit card 3 times.  Once to pay for the stretching and purchase of the earrings, second while I was getting my nose done she mentioned gold and diamond nose ring (so then I purchased that) and third, I forgot Ocean Water on my way out.  It would have been nice to pay at the end for everything; however I am assuming that sometimes a less than stellar crowd has burned piercing owners.   Last, when I went to return, the women running the counter doesn't seem empowered to return or really run transactions.  With the main women (assuming owner) running the back of the office (procedures) the front of the house needs to be able to operate solo.  Both days I had to wait for the women in the back to finish what she is doing to assist the front counter.    I will be back and often as I think this is my new favorite place for unique earrings and body jewelry as I don't know at this point in time I need to new piercings.  However if you are looking I highly recommend Halo.  I think you will feel comfortable and happy with the quality.

Huge fan!  I had gone to a competitor around the corner for about a year and was becoming increasingly frustrated on pricing, until I noticed this place grabbing a coffee one morning.  First the pricing is unbeatable, however you must be prepared with cash or a debit card as it does require up front payment.  This for me is not a make it or break it considering my dry cleaning bill when from $100 to $13 and the quality is on point and if dropped off in the morning you will have back same day.

House of Tricks were have you been?  For 4 years I have been meaning to come here.  I was looking for a place to take the rents while in town and was happy to have HOT show up on yelp.  Amazing, and home run idea.  I am really into the house turn restaurant.  It gives it a cozy slip into the chair by the fire and start knocking back the wine.  Strong menu, and offer something for everyone - I was really impressed that they offer Foie Gras, Sweetbreads to Scallops and Crab Cakes.  I really almost felt overwhelmed with what to get.  Lucky for me I was with a party of 6 and we share :)  I managed to walk away trying quite a bit.  I am not a 100% but I think the menu changes with the season, which makes me want to go back even more, just to see what they come up with next.  Okay down to business I some how made out with trying:  Apps Veal Two Ways: Seared Sweetbreads on Celery Root Puree with Watercress and Braised Veal Bacon with Yellow Curry Cream, Butternut Squash and Red Apple Chutney  Seared Scallops with Mascapone Polenta, Oyster Mushroom Beurre Blanc, Smoked Tomato Vinaigrette and Black Tobiko  Pork Belly on Peanut Rice and Pea Puree  DInner Chili Rubbed Ahi Tuna, Seared RARE, with Mole Amarillo, Red Chili Onion Rings, Yukon Gold Potatoes and Sautéed Oyster Mushrooms  Seared Coffee Cardamom Crusted Duck Breast with Bacon Caramel Apples, Yam Puree, Baby Bok Choy and Pomegranate Gastrique  Braised Tender Belly Pork Osso Bucco with Winter Squash-Mushroom Risotto, Apricot-Cherry Mostarda and Citrus Sage Gremolata  After 4 glasses of Cab I could have done it all over again.  The only thing that surprises me about Tricks is that they do not offer a tasting menu.  With all the wonderful choice a 3, 5 or 7 course tasting would be a great compliment.  I think the menu was surprisingly large and it was actually very difficult to make a choice.  At least with a tasting you are getting what the Chef thinks are the best and a great way to try a restaurant.  Who knows may they will add  I will be back for sure, the ambiance is just a wonderful intimate feeling.  The outdoor sitting area is the best in the valley and they maximize the space heaters and fire pits, that you don't have to worry about sitting outside unless it rains.

I have been here 3 times and each time I have been very impressed with the services.  I am not a huge fan of the front desk but more about that later.    Spa is an Asian zen feeling, there are about 30 or 40 half size lockers contain a terry robe, slippers and a nice box to hold any jewelry ect.  The spa does have a great steam room, hot tub and all the extras when getting ready.  I love being able to use has much shampoo and conditioner as I want! The showers are VERY nice, double head a mix between rain and high pressure, they also provide razors and cream. You do have to ask for a blow dryer as they keep them locked up, but have an assortment of hair products and good brushes.  Waiting room is very nice, floor to ceiling doors that open to a water feature and pond, with blowing white linens.  They offer hot tea, water and some dried cranberries/nuts.  The room is small and there are not any chaise lounges, but mainly just chairs - I don't really view as a relaxation room, but more of a social waiting room.  There are plenty of magazines to occupy you, Fashion, Home ect.  The therapists will come get you and you actually walk outside to the individual rooms, it is really nice to have some of the fresh air, before and after the treatment.    Massage:  I have had two therapists here Cheryl and Keith both fantastic and amazing, top two massages I have ever had and I have had quite a few.  One really nice touch, is they have about 4 different aromatherapy oils that you get to smell and select from, they mix with the lotion and give you a nice kick to the massage.  I do recommend a sports massage, they have some great stretching techniques while being able to do deep tissue.  Both therapists are very skilled and have the perfect pressure without have to tell them or guide them.  Coffee scrub - I had this about a year ago, I don't generally get scrubs but if you have time for an extra and love coffee, you will love how you smell and feel all day after this.    Okay now the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, the front desk.  I walked in and gave my name, they proceed to ask me if I want to use the card of file - I don't even know which card this is as sometimes my boyfriend will treat me.  I told them that I was unsure so they print a bill out.  I told them I would pay at the end since I didn't know what I would tip.  Oh no no, she tells me this is just a preview of the services with prices????  Anyway, I thought it was strange but wrote it off, thought maybe ppl get sticker shocked.  Well.....I leave and go the front desk and say I want to check out - The front desk lady goes oh, well did you get the preview when you came in???  Now I thought that was a preview NOT the bill, watch it here - it already includes a 20% tip.  I just wish they would call a spade a spade, don't call it a preview when I am actually signing the bill and you should point out it includes the tip.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is there is still the IMAX.  Great theater though, I went for the first time to the Cine Capri today to see Social Network.  We caught the 10:25am, ( great idea)  There were maybe 10 people in there so we go the Dead Center Seats.  I had not been to a Cine Capri - The picture is quite nice.  Overall the movie theater is nicely kept, bathrooms clean and friendly staff.

My boyfriend and I finally walked up and checked this place and I can't wait to by a knife here.  I learned more in 20 min than I have entering a Williams Sonoma.  I do think the place is gear towards professional chefs, but they make you feel welcome.  They also offer knife sharpening which is HUGE.  They offer only Japanese Style knifes with both traditional and western handles; from boutique producers, this it legit.  I had never had the opportunity to hold and feel so many knifes and by no means an expert but understand there is a difference.  I recommend checking this place out.  Everyone person even a home cook deserves a good knife.  DOn't forget to bring your existing knifes with you so that you can get the sharpened.  You will be surprised what a good sharpening can do!!!  Can't wait to update my review after we buy our new knife from here.

I have been really excited about trying this place for about a week and finally went today.  I had grabbed a brochure when I went to Baskin Robbins and had been rereading for a week.  My companion and I have been attending the same nail salon for 3 years.  However, this one seemed to have more of a high end, spa like feel to it. Although it looks like it may be walk in friendly, it is not, I suggest you make an appointment.  Which on the weekends they want a credit card and bill for full services.  This morning I woke chipper for what was waiting, knowing the exact luxury treatment I was going to get.  My companion and I met promptly for our 2:40 appointment.  Upon walking in it has a Divine Design feel, a raise old bar with leather high stools, perfectly placed girls lined up like a chic 1960 moment.  Along the other side a lush bench with pillows.  I am undecided at the moment if I miss the massage chairs.  It did face a flat screen running Devil Wears Prada which all girls love.    That is were it stops, the service was actually horrible.  First, the nails tech didn't introduce herself.  My friend and I booked together and they never bothered to ask my friends name.  My nail tech was rough, not gentle with the cuticles.  I don't have any acrylic or gel nails.  I keep mine short and painted.  However I am particular about how a nail stylist cleans up cuticles.  I pause and mentioned it was tender and it didn't seem to register.  She never asked want kind up Mani/Pedi I wanted and preformed a c mani.   I will say the pedicure was has bad, you have to pay $10 extra for callus remover and she didn't really work it out.  If you get one of the packages, ones comes with it.  All in all a big let down. For $77 including tip, I may go again just because I am too lazy to drive to my fav nail salon.  But I can go to my girl of 3 years and get twice as much for $65 including tip and I get the massage chair and a smile

So I have to give the owner of Sundrops credit. She reached out to me, not sure if this was prompted by the yelp review or she genuinely was calling customers. I gave her honest feedback about everything that happened.   She did send me and my friend gift cards, so has any girl would do we decided to give it another shot. First the nail techs this time around were way better. Just the same blah service.   The girl that works the front counter has got to go! I stood there at the counter trying to check in for 5 minutes!!!! Finally my friend chirps up and says were hear for appointments, She replies back "I know" Come on, really - Why don't you greeat me after I walk in the door.  SALES 101  The last point I am going to say, is that everytime I call on the weekend they are booked and there are no walk-ins. On my 2nd trip, I called ahead to make an appointment and I was told they had a big party coming in at 1 so it had to be 11:30. When we got there, I think their were two customers. There service just doesn't warrant the prices or the appointment setting. Sorry I really wanted you to be my new nail salon.

This review is long over due. I have been going to Carmen here for about 3 years. I have only become more impressed over the years. Attention to detail, I never have to order a facial - she simply does what I need. Carmen saved my face. I have struggled with adult acne, not severe but I am vain enough to want perfect skin.   She got me off bad products and introduced a simple, effective, cost efficient routine.   I do have to say BB is priced very compeative for the service.  You can have a $150 facial for around $50-75.  Since the resession they have changed there prices to keep there customers.  They also email speacials all the time as well.  I have not had the other services. My boss has gone there for eye lash extentions and now is the only place she goes.   I think what makes the service so good, is the owner is always there greeting her customers and watching. You can tell she takes pride in her business and she values the customer.   Highly recommend, Also with the popularity of HCG, I made the mistake of going to Red Mountain Spa. Body Beautiful does offer the program and gives better B12 shots.

So my 2nd place this week that doesn't serve real cream.  How?  Do you have a coffee shop that only stocks half & half.  Are cream and sugar not the coffee staple.  I left so I cannot review the staff.  I am sure they are friendly.  Sad I really wanted to try there coffee.

I almost feel bad not giving 5 stars because it really was 5 star service, however, I feel 5 stars are reserved for the best of the best.  ( little things like valet already having your car pulled around on your way out)  Anyway, enough of that.  If you have not tried BLT you are missing out.  Set at the Camelback Inn this restaurant is NOT Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato, but instead Bernard Laurent Tourondel.  Classified as a steakhouse this place is so much more.  It has amazing atmosphere balancing being nice but not pretentious.  The have these great modern cocktails but with an old fashion flair.    Menu:  There is a staple menu however, there is a blackboard special everyday of 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts.  I highly recommend, I actually didn't get steak here at all  Opening:  Warm pate, I asked for more bread because it was so good and they gave me a whole new plate, They take it serious  Apps:  Tuna Tartre, freaking amazing!!!!!!!  Made into a cube and I am assuming using liquid nitrogen, it is made into this cube of goodness served with homemade chips.    Soft Shell Crab Salad with quark dressing and manchego - I have bee wishing i could have this for lunch everyday this week.  Intermission:  A POPOVER, OMG this is the HIGHLIGHT - Gruyere cheese popover with butter and sea salt, I could eat 15 of these and trust me I took home the recipe they give.  Entree:  Red Snapper and Pork Chops.  I do think the pork chops stole the show, with a nice piece of foi gras on each slice with a decadent sauce.  The red snapper was light and very well cooked.  In fact there are some serious knife skills going on in that kitchen.  Desert:  Best in the valley!!!!  Theme seems to be dessert with a flavored ice cream.  I opted for 2, the cheesecake with ginger ice cream and apple tart with pumpkin ice cream.  Solemner:  This is the first place on the west coat I have see carry Billie-Cart Salmon Rose.  The distributor quit giving to places like total wine and restaurants,  I am not even sure how she got this bottle.  We drank it with great pleasure.  Service:  Perfect, I think they have a great rhythm and they do a main waiter and back waiter.  Timing was perfection and on point  I can't wait to go back, I think about the blackboard specials and dying to know what is next.

Hands down one of the best things to do on Saturdays in the valley.  There is so much to choose from and presented in a very casual friendly European way.  My personal favorite the Champagne!  A big fan of Vincents and Vincents Bistro, this a great addition for the nice months Arizona has to offer  Get there early there is all outdoor seating and the tables fill up fast since people tend to hang out and socialize, there is also some seating in the Vincent Bistro were you get coffee  There is so much to choose from, My personal favorite is the omelet and crepe bar.  However, there is pizza, roasted meat & potatoes, treats and a small farmers market  Parking:  This is the tricky part, you can park next door but you have to pay $5 but well worth it, done park across the street I think they have started towing.  Animal Friendly - bring your dog!

NOT ENOUGH FOOD.  We decided to dine with some friends last night.  I had seen this place a couple times, read an article about it and saw the reviews on Yelp.  We all decided to give it a chance.  I have to say that the service was great.  The waiter was on point and the drinks were good.  However, that is were it seems to stop.  First were was the music?  After about 30 minutes there I kept thinking something was missing.  When it hit me there was no music.  The food was good and interesting.  I think the concept is great, and you feel like your on a episode of Top Chef.    Problem is there is not enough food.  After each course all four of us kept getting hungrier and hungrier.  Also, two of at the table request no veal sweetbreads and venison - we both got what we requested not to get.  Although mine was good, a bit bland but eatable.  To say the least - it was a great experience.  We had a great time with friends and we will be talking about the outrageous bill for what we got for a couple years.  If your going to go, your going for the concept, not for hunger   We had to go to Bungalow across the way and grab a grilled cheese after.

Great do it yourself place.  They have a rain check for I think 3 days.  Down side - it would be nice to have someone that dried your car off other than you, but then again it is do it yourself.  The vacuums are set up perfect.  Located up above so they move around in the car better than those that are level.  Good hours. Good selection of car freshners Cleaning supplies available for purchase Takes Credit

It is not often you find a place that you can indulge your taste buds with perfect combinations.  Crudo is a simple in its presentation and crudo by definition is defined  raw fish dish dressed with olive oil, sea salt, and citrus juice.  The Chefs here combine the perfect amount of salt and ingredients to enhance the natural flavors of the fish.  I have now dined there three times and each time enjoy it more and more.  The location is different which makes it that much more enchanting.  You ask yourself 5 star food in a boutique/ spa?  There are about 5 tables inside and a small bar, the outside patio preferably weather permitting.  Menu:  Basically two parts cold and hot - crudo always has a market fish available, along with about 5 other options.  What makes the crudo existing is that the flavors used to dress the Crudo are always changing.  The Hot plates again about 5, you can generally expect a beet stained risotto or squid ink and tuna risotto both so good I can't decide which is better.  Also, on the menu when I have been there is the veal - always perfect and tender falling onto my fork.  The flavors and talent of the chefs here are to be challenged by few in the valley.    Service:  You can't get more personal, the chefs are right there, talking, cooking and tasting.  One server generally taking care of the wine bottles turned glasses full of water.  They remember you, your tastes and are pleasant and love the food their serving.  Wine List:  Wine list is small but solid, they seem to regularly have wine tasting, and I have attended two both in which the wines were spot on.  Not over the top expensive but nice well made wines.  I cannot recommend enough, I think that you are missing a culinary experience if you don't attempt Crudo.  Your tongue won't regret it.

I have been complaining about my knives for a while.  They have become dull and lifeless.  Well they got new life!!!  My boyfriend I frequent the Phoenix Public Market and Farmers Market on Saturdays.  Matthew had seen an ad that they offer knife sharping while you shop.  This morning I woke with a mission - MUST GET KNIFES ROCKIN AGAIN.  What a great find.  We were greeted by a young gentleman and when speaking to him, you can tell knows his stuff.  He gives you a little laminate number and you can shop while he sharpens your knives.    We had 6 knives sharpened all sizes and lengths for $30, and we really only need twice a year.  They looked great!  He puts the tips in a wine cork to prevent them from cutting anything and wraps them in thick plain newswrap.  I highly recommend and the location is great.  Win - win, a little shopping, dog friendly, wine bar, farmers market and food trucks - come out and new knives - I drove straight home and started cooking again.

So I have been wanting to try Smashburger for a while, I heard heard really good things about their fries.  So me a my boyfriend decided to give it a whirl for lunch the other week.  The menu looked and sound great, just when the food came out I was disappointed.    Burger:  It is the thin flat, sonic style paddy.  Now I know why when we asked for medium they told us no.  I wash picturing more of the juicy thick burger cooked to order.  Fried:  There specialty is a olive oil and garlic fry.  They forgot to make mine the special way.  I mentioned something when my food came out.  You can tell they took my fries, dumped EVOO all over them and brought them out  Fried Pickles:  These were actually the  best, thin slices fried with a nice dipping sauce, I do recommend this  Milk Shake:  Okay it would have to be impossible to mess this up.  Haggen Daas ice cream....enough said  Long story short I see why people would like smashburger I just prefer a different kind of burger

Fox got it right on this one.  Great location and blows Deluxe out of the water.  The food is spot on and service was great....SHort of it, for those not wanting to read the whole review - big patties that are juicy on a great bun.  No flat burgers!!!! So to break down  Atmosphere:  Chill, open and good outdoor seating.  The Cow mural is pretty rad in the background..  Bar is open to both inside and outside.  Hostess was not impressive, but then again it is the hostess ( sorry girls/boys its true)  I care more about the server  Server: Fantastic, I would have hired to anything customer service related, offered suggestions and even recommended something and had the chef make.  Food: menu straight forward burgers nothing funny.  The zucchini fries are great as well as there general fries.  I had the Zin burger and added mushrooms and switched out manchego to havarti.  Matthew had the breakfast burger which had a fried egg and avocado.  They offer shakes that sound great, but with a huge burger and fried I did pass.  This place is solid - I recommend over smashburger and Deluxe

OMG I am not even sure why I am not giving this place 5 stars.  We went there last weekend and ended up back there again this weekend!!!  Nice to see the menu changes even weekly.  There were some things that we had the week before, Pork Belly Buns ( which seem to be very popular )  good, but very filling.  The restaurant is a tapas Japanese style and perfect for two to share.  There are no really main dishes, I recommend just ordering everything you want and they will just bring it out as it is ready.  Some seasonal items that we had that I highly recommend if you are in there in the next couple weeks Soft Shell Crab and Stuffed Squash Blossoms.  I was totally bummed that the Black Cod was already gone off the menu as it was SOOOO good.  We had the House Cured Salmon, Warm Duck Salad and Almond Fritters.  Very strong selection of wine and Sake of course :)  The place is absolutely adorable, the Teeter House is name after the woman who had lived there.  It is a historic home that has been beautifully redone.  Their servers on very attentive and done act overwhelmed.  However, you will always see the owner/chef there which always makes a huge difference in how a restaurant is ran.  I could go on and on about the food, I just recommend you go.  If you get a chance sit at the bar, you will be able to meet and see Nobuo at work.  He is a very friendly chef and you will be very impressed by him.  This is a great fresh take for the Valley and I recommend hoping out of that Pizza line and coming over here, it will blow your socks off and not break the bank  PARKING:  Note about parking, it is tight, you need to park in the garage behind the science center but hope it is not an event night or it is $12, there are meters around the place but hard to find one

What a great concept, They successfully managed to make a calorie friendly menu without forsaking taste.  The menu changes with the season and they also have a weekly menu.  I do think the deco is a little circa 1992, however my counter part rather enjoyed it.  Bar is huge and cozy, great happy hour I would think.    I had enjoyed the following less 475 calories dishes Mussels - nice red sauce and cooked perfectly Flat bread:  I had both the Reuben and Chipolte shrimp with crushed pineapple, WOW Cab Chicken - nice healthy, great flavor, came with golden beets which I have not had before, very pleasant surprise Peanut butter and Chocolate mini dessert and Red Velvet Cake mini  The FlatBread I have to say is hands down the best alternative to pizza, I will never fill guilty again! Not to mention blows  fast pizza out of the water.  There is a great assortment of salads, sandwiches and entrees.  The wine and cocktail list is on point.  I was happy to see the place was packed on a Saturday at 2.  Most places have started to die down.  I had been there when they first opened and they were sparse.  Service was a bit too friendly, I know are server was just trying to do his job to I got respect, Ask for Cole, he will pay attention to you and seems to know the menu.    I think the restaurant is a new start to a food trend I can't wait to see.  Having focused on my loosing weight and being a foodie, the two don't really go hand and hand - This is a great way to enjoy a night out, without feeling like you wasted the time you spent at the gym.  The flavors are all there and with a changing menu it offers an opportunity not to have the same thing twice.  I would really like to try dinner as I have only been there during lunch.  This will become an easy default place to go to in the area.  Bonus:  They offer black napkins, I think a lot of places over look this  Factoid:  Great place for big parties and they have oddly perfectly set tables.  There wine glasses are the correct ones and there seems to be an attention to detail.

was so excited to hear that a new Thai place was opening since I felt Thai Lahna has fallen short over the last few years.  Well HUGE disappointment, I got my all time go to dish the Pad Thai.  I cannot describe how bad it was, normally when I think food is bad it is bearable and you will still eat it.  I actually had to put this down after 2 bites.  I had asked for mild and was expecting a nice flavor topped the peanuts.  Nope, I got a mouth full of crushed red pepper.  Arcadia needs a new Thai place, but the old fast food joint tried to turn modern Thai is not the place.  I think I am stuck still driving to Tempe for some good Thai.    The place is pending a liquor license going to be much needed to get the food down.  Also, a final note - Thai should not be that expensive unless it is really good.  Possibly could be because it is new and maybe I will give it another shoot, but not anytime soon

So I decided finally to give this place another shot.  I was really craving Pad Thai and didn't want Thai Lahna.  Of course being my blunt self I decided to tell the gentleman that answer the phone the "I really want some pad Thai but the first time I got it here is sucked, do you always put red pepper flakes?"  He was nice and pleasant and took the time to ask what happened last time.  I ordered the crab puffs (wontons) and the pad thai mild.  I ended up eating it all, so it must have been good - not the best I have had, but great for on the fly and around the corner.  I think the true test will be is 3rd time a charm, I was my order good because I said something.  Inside:  Last time my boyfriend had picked up for me, so this was the first time I had been in.  The ol' Wendy's looks pretty good inside.  Quite funny how you can tell it is an old fast food joint, but inside the lighting was good, atmosphere was soft.  I am a big fan of this trend, it worked for over easy and is a great way for real estate to get used.  In the end I am going to go again, you will probably never find much out more about the food because I never order anything but pad thai.  However, wiling to move this place from 1 to 2 stars, who knows maybe soon it will be my fav  PS I still think it is slightly over priced for what you get.

Okay my A** is still on fire!!!! and including other parts.   I don't know how to say it any other way, this is a total body workout.  I have now gone 3 times and it is a perfect alternative to a trainer.  I had worked out with trainers for 3 years and missed being around people.    Trainers here vary, I do prefer Adam, and think being a new student he takes the time to show you alternatives, not everyone is a rock body.  I have gone to two other teachers and They were good and the workout was amazing.  I recommend, they have some packages deals the are actually good and a reduced price.  I hate deals that you buy a package of 10 and it is only $5 savings.  You have to set up an online account and you book yourself online and prepay.    CANCELLATION POLICY:  They do have strange cancellation policy, you must cancel 6 hours before but if you don't not only to you loose the money you paid for the class but you also get charged an additional $25.

AMAZING.  I was turned on to Bosa by a co worker an I have never looked back.  Located in what use to be fast food place Bosa ROCKS.  They remind me of the place I use to go to as a kid.  Perfect fluff and crispy-ness.  I highly recommend Bosa to anyone.  The only problem is that it is going to equal extra time at the gym, because I have yet to eat just one when I get them.  Which one is your favorite???????? :)

I have been sick and was really craving a burger and fries.  I have been driving past the new Five Guys on 44th and today seemed like the perfect day to try.  The service was actually really good and the employees were very friendly.  Also, just a side note they have the really cool new Coke machines that allows you to mix flavor into your fountain drink as seen on Food Network.  The problem is the food.  We got 2 burgers, hot dog and fries.  The fries I thought were decent but over salted.  The hot dog was nothing special and the burger was a let down.  I was really expecting a in-n-out style burger and walked away with a smashburger experience.  All Hype no follow thru.  I was also shocked that a place that prides themselves on their burgers and relying on one product they don't ask how you would like it cooked.  Even when ordering a burger at Chile's I am asked how I would like it done  I have to say I was surprised, seeing as they are Zagat rated I was expecting a lot more.  The concept is fresh, clean and I like the peanuts you can munch on while you stand in line and wait for your order.  Just overall I think they need to improve the quality of their seasoning and style.

Someone call Robert Irvine we need Restaurant Impossible!!!  This is Green Lantern gone terribly wrong.  I had driven past this place quite a few times and fully excepted a DIPPING BAR.  I had this mystical idea that I would walk in and have tapas of different items to dip into different dips.  Straight forward right.......Well I think not.  I have to start out with the most obvious.  I ordered lamb with goat cheese fondue.  Fondue which is melted cheese that you DIP IN.  What comes out two lamb cops on a s*** bed of rice that seems to come from a bag with peas, corn and carrots in it and is on every dish.  With a cheese sauce on top.  Need I say anything more.......  The dips that they offer are actually on the back side of the menu, they do offer suggestions under each dish and burger, bit isn't the whole concept a dipping bar, would you not what the dips to be front and center??????  The dips are not that good anyway and are served in normal restaurant ramekins.    Decor:  Oh help, green everywhere are the pictures don't go together - again not clear cohesive theme.  You have flowers on one wall and martini glasses on another.  This place could have been great, but it just got lost - I give 2 more months,

I am sorry this place is beautiful to look at but the food is a huge disappointment.  I wish I didn't have to say it but City Hall is better.  I should start from the beginning...........  I had been looking forward to come here, so by the time our reservations rolled around I was ready to eat!!!!  We arrive about 15 min before our reservation, and proceeded to the bar to order a drink.   First the access to the bartender was impossible and when we finally ordered my boyfriend had his drink in a few minutes and my glass of champagne no where to be seen ( we will revisit this later)  We waited for 10 min before the rest of our party showed and we were seated.    NOTE - they do have good music, and you can sit at the grand piano and have apps and cocktails.  The live music is a great cover.  Upon sitting we promptly notified our waiter that we had not paid for our drinks at the bar and that I had ordered a glass and never received it.  He then took our drink order and returned with the beverages and I finally received my glass.  About 5 mins after that the server comes back with the first glass I ordered sitting down a 20 min old champagne that was flat and room temperature at that point - and proceed to charge me for it!!!!!  He appeared to think this was an accomplishment that he found the glass, I was at this point just annoyed and thought it was poor taste.  The Food:  Such promise to fall so flat, the menu does offer a variety other than steak, but a larger seafood selection and some chefs specials.    Apps - we ordered the Calamari and the Burrata with Roast Peppers ( why they give 1 piece of crostini for 4 people I don't understand)  I had to ask for extra 2X and then is dropped about 7 pieces on the plate ( OVERKILL)  The calamari was decent but nothing to rave about, the breading is lighter and there are two dipping sauces, and remulaude and cocktail.  I ordered the Bone in Filet Medium, this is were I just get upset.  It comes out half well done and the other half raw!!!!!!!!!!!! I am not even sure how one can achieve cooking a steak that bad but it was the worse I have ever had, EVER.    Sides - FAMILY STYLE, so if you order, 1 side will split 4 ways easy, the server said that it would serve 4 tops, but I think it could push serving 6 people.  We had the Gouda Cheese Au Gratin COLD & UNDERCOOKED  Broccoli - UNDERCOOKED AND HARD, in fact I really wanted to send it back, but at this point it was just pointless.  I really just wanted to finish my meal  Gnocchi - Has to come from a BAG, no one would make gnocchi that big and you could barely taste the lobster in it.    Needless to say, just the whole place fell flat.  The service wasn't bad but not steller as I would except for a $700 meal (4 people and booze included)  They are suppose to have another bar and water feature up stairs on the 3rd level, they were at capacity so we were not allowed to check it out.  I think the place my stay busy because of location and the crowd is definitely a certain crowd.  However I will be staying to old faith full City Hall in Old Town.

I try not to give out 5 stars lightly, and FastMed deserves a 5 star rating.  I never thought I would be writing a review on how an Urgent Care facility amazing.    With that said, I cannot say enough about the staff and how I was treated.  I came down with a terriable sinus infection late Saturday evening, and was parked out front when they opened Sunday at 8am on 12/01  (which I think 8am on a Sunday is pretty good)  I was the first person in and there were no others coming in behind me.  I filled out the normal 1st time patient paperwork and read the HIPPA info, but whats nice is the offered me an OJ why I did waited!!!  What a nice and personal touch.  Also they even noticed it was my birthday and mentioned happy birthday to me.  Not only did I find this impressive this is also and indication that they read their paperwork.  The staff was personable and the PA that saw me actually talked to me like a human, she asked what I normally had been given (I am a long time suffer of sinus infections and know exactally what works and what doesn't)  She even made a suggestion for a better nasal spray that I liked way more than what I had previosuly been taking.  My regular doctor is at the Mayo which is a very long drive for me being in Old Town, however I would not think twice about coming here again.  I hope that management sees this reviews and gives the staff there the proper recoginition.

I found this place on Yelp about 6 months ago.  I should have written a review the first time I went, but I got side tracked.  I went here for a 2nd time this past weekend and I cannot believe I haven't been back sooner.  There is a reflexology place a bit closer to my house that I have been going to, but I think I will be switching it up to here now, Worth the extra 2 miles for;  1) Better Price 2) Free membership (the other place I had to pay $50 for a year) 3) They are VERY friendly and customer focused 4) They use bio-freeze on your neck and shoulders  5) They put a hot compress on your neck and shoulders post chair massage while they work on your feet.  They offer any combination you are looking for between chair and foot massage or you can get just a single service.  I personally recommend 30 min chair and 1 hour foot.

Open on Saturday!!!!  That alone is worth its weight in gold.  I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to go to the chiropractor but couldn't make their office hours.  This place is set up a lot like Massage Envy were you can buy a membership for $50 a month but that gets you 4 adjustments a month.  Which is a great deal.  I pay the drop in rate since I go when I need. (like today)  I have been to this location and before this one opened I went to the Camelback location.  Every doctor I have seen has been fantastic and your in and out.  The locations are clean and service is always good.  I highly recommend.

I now have been to Madison Improvement Club about 5 times since it has opened over the last 2 weeks.  Overall I like it far more than the other spinning options.  I am not qualified to review yoga as I do not like yoga and will probably never try it.    I have had the luxury of spinning at a lot of different studios across major cities, and have had the benefit of some awesome classes and studios.  This studio is the best option for Arcadia.  I have been a member of the village for 4 years and I am tired of fighting for a bike and the music.  MIC does have GREAT music and it is loud.  The mic system the teachers use sometimes isn't always clear and you can't understand what they are saying, but I am guessing trail and error while opening up.  Clean, modern and great color scheme.  The spin room is LeMond bikes (secretly wish they had spinner bikes, but they don't seem as popular in AZ as the East Coast)  there are black, neon lights and green little stars.  The best feature is the mirror wall that opens to camelback after class and airs out the room.    Pros: Great location  So far good teachers  Great music  Café appears good  Cons:  Why cubbies and not digital lockers?  This makes no sense to me at all - no woman is leaving her items in a cubby hole and I don't want to put in a hot spin room, so that leaves the car.........I am assuming this was cost cutting or they felt most ppl would be in the area and easy to just grab shoes and go.  The café POA system should be the same as the booking system so you can bill your account  Last, the packages ect.  Right now the largest class I have been to is about 10 ppl.  Paying $18 a drop in to have 3 ppl in class is discouraging.  There are then 2 packages options $300 for 25 classes and $75 for 5 (unsure on that one) I did find online if you sign a YEAR membership that it was $150.  I pay $150 for the village and it is a full gym.  I really think they need to re-think their packages; my suggestion for the local neighborhood supporting this would be a 3 month at a time membership for $120 unlimited.  I would be all over it.  Also why classes are not full, it somewhat sucks to be paying full price.......I know there is rent ect, but more ppl may come try it out if you run some just opened specials.    MIC offers online booking and the times offered are fairly good.  I do wish the 4:30 spin M-F was more 445 or 5, that way you can make after work and not have to wait until 6 to catch the next class.  Overall good first impression, there have been some ups and downs in their first couple weeks but I will definitely been trying more teachers ect and I will be sure to update the review.

An update:  I was very impressed with the owner and his responsiveness to my post.  I am happy to say that they have lowered their Drop in Price to $15.00 - Whoo Hoo.    I also would like to prop out a teacher; Todd Schuler.  I tried his class for the first time last week and LOVED IT.  He really made it fun, lots of different jumps, worked the arms, great mix between speed and hills.  My only complaint is that he only teaches Tuesday and Thursday...would love to see him teach a weekend class.  I can guarantee when I can hit up T/T I will be a regular in his class. "sprinkle of some more"

Spot on.  They have found a great balance between having healthy food but good tasting food.  I have the impression that the chef knows his customer.  They have continued to expand and grow their menu in a calculated not rushed way.  I think this allows each dish to shine.    I eat there quite often and my other half (who doesn't work out) enjoys the food and always comments "doesn't taste like health food)  I do wish they would ass their Nut Juice from the juice cleanse onto there menu.    I could see a second location in North Scottsdale doing really well and look forward to my next meal there.

I am a really big fan of this Bikram studio.  I have to say they do a really good job of making everyone feel invited and comfortable.  I actually found the studio to be spacious but they may be because I have not been there when it is incredibly packed.  I also had never been there prior to the remodel.  Teachers all learn your name when you walk in and they use it in class.  I LOVE this touch, makes me feel welcomed and I appreciate my name being used to assist me in correcting form and showing me modifications.  I really feel as the teacher is very engaged with the students taking the time to walk around, correct, give kudos and be there if needed.  Savasana is never rushed at the end.  They have staggered the classes to allow enough time.  I will say that I have never considered really practicing yoga until I came here.  Locker rooms are small but they work with the space and I feel comfortable leaving my items in the locker room, if they have run out of lockers.  There is only one shower, however not many people use it post workout and those that do are quick quick, so you may wait 5 mins tops.  Overall, I am a fan and will continue to be a patron of this studio

It pains me to have to write this review.  However, 4 visits in the first week and no improvement, makes me think its management and not growing/new opening pains.  Were to start....I will start with the experience that actually motivated me to write this review followed by the experience I had today.  Essence claim to fame is the Macaroon, so naturally being able to walk in and get a macaroon or variety of macaroon is important (have to do at least your claim to fame really well)  So I stopped in Saturday (following Friday lunch were they ran out of cheese) to buy 10 mini macaroons.  I waited in line and then promptly ordered when it was my turn.  While ordering they looked in the case to see if they had what I ordered so I assumed that they would be pulling my macaroons out of the case.  So I then peered into the case and ordered what I saw was available.  I should have know something was wrong then because she was not grabbing and putting them in a bag.  Next after repeating my order (which I have had to do every single time I have gone in) she gives me a number and says it is for my coffee.  So I am standing there twiddling my thumbs watching everyone behind me get their pastries and macaroons and leave.  So I ask "May I have my macaroons?"  This is followed by that will be 5-10 minutes for your macaroons!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTH are you kidding me, I just watched you give 5 people after me their macaroons.  Then one of the other women says "Well it takes 5-10 minutes for special orders"  DUDE YOU ARE A MACAROON STORE, ordering 10 mini macaroons is not a special order.    Then this is now followed by "Well they are making them in the back"  followed by a sarcastic response from me, "really they are making them in the back"  "YES"  This is were I start to lose it.  There is nothing I HATE more than being LIED to.  I watched them dodge me and never go into the back to "make them" and proceed to pull them out of the very case I ordered them from.  I also watched a gentlemen come in and order 10 mini macaroons and get them right then, pay and walk out.  So I point this out to the women that told me they were being made in back and mine was a special order and she looks at me and goes "OK".  I get you are busy, but lying and being rude doesn't help the situation.  In fact to repeat myself I hate being lied to and why lie when the customer is standing there watching you not go in back and serve other people food.    Brings me to today, I thought okay Emily, you are being way too hard on this bakery they just opened.  So my friend and I decide to go in for Brunch.  I ordered the turnover and got my food oddly fast.  Well that is because it was ICE COLD.  so I walked up with my plate and ask if they turnover was suppose to be served cold (never know) and she says no.  I so try to hand her my plate and she is looking at me like I am weird.  Then asks me to take my knife and fork and goes Ill heat it up......I reply "are you going to nuke it"??!?!?!?  She goes "Ill ask for a new one"  Almost like she was doing me a favor.    Sit back down, wait FOREVER for the new turnover (definitely did not put a rush on the turnover)  New plate hot turnover come out, and now COLD eggs.  It was at that moment I gave up.  No apology, no free mini macaroon, in fact they could seem to care less that they are the problem, and not the customer.  I understand new openings, but with a new opening generally comes customer service.  Everyone is running around like they were not trained.  You have customers coming in ordering who have never been to your store and you cant even tell them what sodas you have or were they are located.    If you are going to place your drinks around the corner, put a sign out informing your customers what beverages you serve.  Instead I tried to order a couple different things before they told me the drinks were in a case around the corner.  So to summarize, I find the staff rude, the service slow, uninformative. and food mediocre.  It will probably do well because it is in Arcadia, however this Arcadian who loves macaroon will not go back unless its because the other dining party wants to go and I will continue to drive to Classic Cake and Confections to get my macaroons at least they act like they appreciate my business.

So I am giving 4 stars to start because I have only done spin so far.  However first impressions are excellent.  I was a bit nervous about the crowd I am a "curvier" girl and was happy to see not everyone a rock hard scottsdale body but I was pleasantly surprised how all shapes and sizes were there and how friendly everyone was I even made a new friend and hopeful work out buddy!!!!  So the run down; one stop shop for all the boutique gym you have memberships too (Hot Yoga, Flow Yoga, Yoga, Spin, TRX, Barre, Boxing, HIIT and Crossfit)  Really the only thing missing is Pilates.  I have always wanted to try Barre but with already having one $150 membership I hadn't tried for fear of liking too much and I don't need to spend $300 on two boutquie studios, but now I don't have too.  I did spin today and took Stephanie's class with DJ Shadow, I have personally always been a huge fan of Stephanie's spin class and I was happy to see Wendy will be teaching she has great music.  The bikes for one are not La Mond and have the multi hand positions and ride a lot like soul cycle bikes for those of you out there like me that are a sucker for SC.    Spin room had great air flow with cubbies if you don't want to use the locker room (more on that later)  Room is dark with some low lighting and a DJ booth.  I am sold and can't wait to try some of the other teachers.  Tomorrow I am trying Hot Yoga however I bet that I will probably ended up in the regular yoga or Heat Flow, but I figured I would give it a shot, I am really hoping it is slower and like Bikram with music, if so I will probably be doing everyday.  Juice Bar:  I tried the Hangover and LOVED it, juice bar is straight forward Juices and Smoothies.  You can pre order as well.    Locker Room:  YEY!  a place to get ready, open space with two showers and a space to do hair and makeup, towels provided.    Price:  I signed up for unlimited $110, from my understanding they will increase roughly $10 for every 500 or so memberships until they end up at their final membership price around $150-ish.    Location:  Parking is going to be the largest challenge, your best bet is to go straight for the garage or in my case just ride my bike the mile.  I am hopping that because most classes are mornings and evenings during the week parking won't be awful, however weekends and holidays with the mall open might be tight.    Cons:  Wish they had some hot breakfast items and maybe salad or sandwiches you can gran on the go.  to be honest I am not sure if they might have this in there future plans already.  Although they do offer nutritional services and might take them up on it.  Overall I am really excited to attend some more classes and hopefully update to 5 stars.  Will keep you posted as I try the other classes.

I was rather excited to have a "seafood" restraunt open in the area that didn't require driving outside my five mile bubble, however I was disappointed by the menu and product.  With that said the interior redesign was done well and captures that cape cod/nantucket feeling.  Back to the food, myself along with my significant other and two other couples went on a Friday night, to my surprise at 7:30pm there was almost no one in the restaurant.  We started with cocktails which were mixed well and had a decent pour.  We opted for the crab dip to start, which had a good portion of crab and I thought was the strongest dish on the menu.  Next we ordered the calamari, lobster rolls and a dozen oysters.  The food was not "awful I can't eat this" food, but it was not "man this is great I can't wait to come back" either.  The calamari seemed over breaded, the lobster roll didn't have enough lobster to bread ratio and the oysters didn't seem fresh.  I would said the oysters were by far the biggest disappointment.  I must admit I expected to see a raw bar when I walked in, I didn't even realized they did have oysters until someone in our party ordered them.  They were way too brine-y and served oddly on a plate.    I was expecting the party to leave after drinks and apps, however the group decided to stay for entrees.  Reviewing the entree selection I found nothing to catch my attention and the seafood choices to be limited.  Settling on fish tacos, the fish seemed lost in toppings and served with no sides; however the burger and chicken dishes order by our friends were served with sides.    Overall the service was good and friendly, I did find it odd that the owner/chef walked thru the dining room and didn't greet any of the five guests spending money in his establishment.  Unfortunately even if they did a menu revamp, I think they lost that initial momentum.  I think had the flavors been more interesting and felt a little more local (yes I am aware that we are not by water - but you can still create this feeling of local-ness) this place would have knocked it out the park as I think Arcadia and Scottsdale have been craving a great seafood restaurant.  However with a competitor opening soon up the street I cannot say I feel the fate of the Yacht Club will be good.
