I always eat here, since A) the food is great, B) it's super close, and C) the wait staff is really friendly.  I've never had bad service here, and I come all the time.  Although, maybe that's why I get good service, because I come all the time. :)  I must admit, though, I only rotate through maybe four dishes on the menu.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Overpriced sake, mediocre rolls, and the Yellowtail nigiri was obviously past it's prime. I'm lucky it didn't make me ill. Won't be back when Hana Sushi is just around the corner at 7th Ave and Missouri.
