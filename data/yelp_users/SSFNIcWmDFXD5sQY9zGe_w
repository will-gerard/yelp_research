Horrible customer service. I went in for the first visit for alterations and they were very standoffish. When picking up the pants, I noticed the zipper had been broken. I brought this to their attention and they refused to fix the zipper or reimburse me for a repair. It was obvious that the damage was done at their shop because the pants were brand new. Also, I would NOT have walked out of the dressing room and proceed to be fitted with a zipper down.  The owner proceeded to argue with me when I asked him to at least reimburse me for the tailoring, and kept this up for about 10 minutes. He said he could fix the zipper, but out of principle he would not do anything to the pants. He said that he had many high end clients and did not need one patron's business.   Very disappointed, will never return.

Went to Barrio cafe on a busy Friday night during the 'chilly' season in Phoenix. We were there to celebrate the remembrance of a family member in an upbeat way.  The food was great, starting with the table side guacamole (do it!). It was really tasty for me, though some people at my table weren't into the while pomegranate seeds. I get it.  My entree was amazing, I had the Chiles en Nogada. Almost anything with that much cream and butter will be amazing, but I savored every last bite and wished for more.  The atmosphere was so-so. Unfortunately they had a band playing that was too loud for the small space, and this on top of a packed restaurant with several guests waiting caused us to be unable to hear each other speak. Hopefully they will keep the live music to less busy nights in the future.

Where do I even start with Geisha. This is our GO TO happy hour and sunday fun day spot. Happy hour pricing cannot be beat, and the food is consistently tasty. Drinks are the same. There usually isn't a long wait for a table, and if there is a wait the bartenders are quick to to serve you in the meantime. The people-watching on the street is also part of the good time ;) I strongly recommend the sashimi bowl, caterpillar roll, rainbow roll, and kinky cooler. Hope everyone enjoys it as much as we do!

I am sad to say that I'm very disappointed by this location. I love Dunkin' Donuts as I'm  from back East and think their coffee is the best, that's why I'm giving this review two stars. This store deserves less. This location has very poor customer service. Not only do they not accept Dunkin Groupons, they also don't do the Dunkin punchcard, and when I went there on my birthday for my free coffee I tried to pull up the barcode they needed on my app and I couldn't find it. They couldn't tell me where  it was and refused to give me a coffee for my birthday. I found this particularly poor customer service since I am in there consistently and it was on their website that they couldn't find the info they needed. I've given this location so many chances because they are just down the street from my house but it just doesn't make sense to go there anymore. New management please!

Brandon at Smooth Moves is very helpful, professional, and is great at staying in touch at all times.  I recommend Smooth Moves to my friends as the best movers in the Phoenix area!  What a great find!

Have been here a few times and each time the food was tasty and service good. Last night I got the Chicken Madrid Skewers and they were awesome. A seasonal menu item so hurry in and try them! Definitely head in for happy hour when several apps are half off and martinis are $5.25. Otherwise you'll be spending a good amount of cash on just apps and drinks.

Finally got to try Thrive Acai (thank you Groupon!) on our way to the Sprouts next door. I got the Chocolate Coconut Bowl and the bf got the Chocolate Cherry. They were both great, though I liked mine a bit better since it had pea protein, which gave it a smooth yummy texture. The ladies at the counter were knowledgeable and helpful, even though we came in about 10 minutes before closing.  Took off one star due to the bowl taking a little long to make, and the whole place smelling really strongly like the nail salon next door. They mentioned something about fixing the ventilation soon. I hope so, I plan to go back soon!

This time of year, Sunday Funday calls to me like a flower to a honey bee. Especially on a 3 day weekend. This time the location was Whiskey Row, which boasts bottomless mimosas and a yummy menu.  My favorite part of the experience was the huge booth which easily fit our large party. A welcome reprieve from the crazy too-packed atmosphere that I've experienced on weekend nights. I ordered the egg white omelet, which was protein filled, if a little greasy. The mimosas were good to start, though seemed to be mostly orange juice when the refills came around. Please don't skimp on the champagne next time Dierks!  All in all our group had a good time, and it was a good start to this week's Sunday Funday.
