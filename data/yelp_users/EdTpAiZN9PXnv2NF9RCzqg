This was the worst food you could have on mill avenue. Not to mention the lady that "helped" us was the worst waitress I've ever had on mill avenue. She couldn't have been a ruder person. She cursed us out as we left from the eatery! She was the worst person you could get as a server and I pray to God that no one else has to go through the horrible service we had here. Unfortunately the food was additionally irredeemable. The food sucked, but our waitress sucked even more.

I've been coming to this coffee shop since it has opened and I've always had an amazing experience!! Try and iced dirty chai latte!!! The best there is!

The food was good, also I saw the bands Young the Giant and Holy Child here so that was pretty cool... Also you haven't lived until you've eaten their hot carrots
