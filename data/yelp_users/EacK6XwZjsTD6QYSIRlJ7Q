This is the only spot I trust to get my ride a bath, even though I drive a beater, the staff here treat it as if its an expensive European car.   Attention to detail not only comes from the car wash staff but also from Gene who meticulously maintains the gloss and shine of all my Italian kicks.

I come to this place almost every Monday for their unique Chef Special (off menu).  So far I have not been disappointed.  BTW, who can say no to Coronado Cafe's Chicken Chowder Soup?  And make sure you leave some room for dessert.  if you're on a diet then please disregard this last note.  :)

This is by far the best BBQ place in Phoenix IMO.  The only problem that I always ran into is what to get.  All the meats are smoked to perfection and the link are spiced just the way i like it.  The BBQ sauce is so good that I keep a gallon of this wonder in my fridge at all times.  Oh, and they also have Alcohol!!

I'm only half Asian so I'm not sure if my opinion counts. tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up.  yet the place was packed.    There was enough oil on my food for me to deep fry my thanksgiving turkey, luckily it was not peanut oil otherwise i would have ask for a to go box.

This facility has moved across the street to 3815 E. Bell suite 1405.  This clinic is behind the 3811 building so its kind of hard to see and tricky to get to.  The waiting area is much bigger than the other labcorp facilities to accommodate the average wait time of 40 mins for any walk in, so make sure you get an appointment thru their intuitive reservation system online @ www.labcorp.com   As much as I hate needles the Phlebotomist I had was a uber pro leet, got poked without even knowing, not sure if that a good or a bad thing.  Anyways it was much better than the one I had from Sonora Quest who left a bruise my arm and scar that lasted 2 weeks. Bastard!

Great Place if you have a lot of time to waste. . . .     Here's the breakdown. estimate time in increments of 5 mins  about 5 mins to get seated another 5 to get take our drinks 10 mins to get the drinks and order our food 10 mins for the food to arrive * 10 mins into eating . . . .  hmm . . . .  where's our server? 10 mins has past, drink cups are empty . . . .  .  hmm. . .  should I get a APB on our server? 15 mins later . . . .   how was everything?  Whoa! his alive!!! another 5 mins to get the check . . . . wait my automatic watch stopped working . .  . . . .  All in all the food is mediocre but with molasses type service and contraband prices this place to needs to be banned just like their cigars.

This place is a must for the true Buffalo (the City) style hotdog lover, plain simple, yet satisfying.  But be prepared, this place does not do any other Transaction besides hard earned Cash!!  BTW there is an BofA ATM machine a stone thow away.

If your Miata is acting out, Mike's place is the spot you can trust to straighten up.  Mike is probably the most friendliest Miata Guru that I know, very honest and really reliable.  thanks, Mike!

At first most of my noobie friends are very skeptical about the fusion of Chicken and Waffles.  but after taking them to this place and experiencing firsthand the divine taste of what they first believe was a anomalous combination, it made them change their Religion.  For lunch time I suggest that you get to this place as early 11AM since this place has a very limited sitting you can expect up to 2 hour wait. :(

I'm not sure why most Middle Eastern people are skinny but this place serves a mountain full of good quality, flavor full heaps of heavenly meal. I personally like the Barg tandem with shrimp and scallops. and yes I can eat all of it. BTW I'm barely pushing 150 LB. something about their basmati rice i cant quite put together, for some odd reason i can eat twice as much of these than a normal average rice. Anybody has an idea?

If you enjoy Salt and Lousy Service then this is the spot for you.  Honestly, I'm not sure why people are so hype about this place.  Yes the Salsa is spicy but really has no taste to it.  it's like Spicy water.  Everybody in our party of 7 did not even eat a quarter of their meal.  The Machaca that i had must have been Marinated, Aged and Cooked in Salt using a Rock Salt Oven and to make matters worse the servers were no where to be found to refill our refreshments as our mouth dried like Cured Hides.  This place should have been called Los "Sal" Molinos and should have stayed a Funeral Home and use the large amount of Salt they use for Embalmment.  Currently competing with Morton for the #1 spot as Salt distributor in the South West Region.

I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded  1. Space: first of all this place is really, really, really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort.  I recommend small party with 4 people max.  2. Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available.  3. Quality: not so great, my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy. I myself is not a big fan of Fat.  4. Beverage: uh, I rather go to Circle K and get a cup.  5: Service: ok, but for such a limited customers how can service go wrong?    All in all I was not impress with this place.  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about, but once again I very disappointed.    BTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger.

WOW!  This must be the best Lenny's burger shop that I have ever been.  The dual ordering center is a major plus.  Burger still good but the chili dog is off the hook!!    oh and dont forget the shakes.  to go. . .. .   :)

After months of begging I finally granted my girlfriend her wish to check this place out.  Since we were on a time constraint lunch I decided to order the Recession Special Plate; this is a Ham and Swiss on a baguette that comes with a side salad for less than $6.  The only gripe that i have is that the bread was stale and almost impossible to chew. Not sure if its part of the "Recession Experience"  but I guess you get what you pay for . . .  Other than that the decor, atmosphere and specially the service was impeccable.

This is the replacement of Ayako's / Akita Ya.    The food, as always are phenomenal. However the location and the settings lacks the Original Japanese Aura.  And where the hell are the Teppanyaki Tables? :)  Anyways despite a few setback i still go to this place for their one of a kind Spider Roll and their Euphoric Shrimp Tempura.

Groupon Groupies Beware!!!!  Good luck getting a simple oil change at this location.  I'm cheap so I want to use my Groupon for 3 oil changes.    First they ask that you call in first thing each day in the  morning which i did, several times, same answer "were booked" but if you drop your car we will get to it.    So I finally decided to drive there and drop my vehicle off, this time the guy said, oh, we are not taking any more today.  WTF?  So I asked how long does it normally take if they do take my car.  Answer: 1 to 3 hours.  Really?  for an Oil Change? BTW I drive a car not a Semi.  Hopefully Groupon can refund my $$  from this jokers.

Had a hard time finding this place at night but its definitely worth the drive.  Parking is also slim but Valet is available.  This small place comes with excellent customer service and most of all GOOD ice cream!!!  Will be back for more Vietnamese Coffee and Butter Pecan goodness. . .

Game Night, Suns v T'Wolves.  but its amateur night at the bar.  This place hires all the bar-tending class failures (is that even possible?).   I had to double check and made sure I'm not wearing my Army Camo's cuz it felt like they could not see me.    finally got a drink with lingering empty glass, not once I had a drink check, ordered a shot for my buddy that required several reminding's.  On top of that I was handed somebody else's bill.  WOW!  I don't think this place deserve any Stars.  Snap!! I just realize that I too, as a man would be dis grunted if I have to wear a skirt to make living.

Attempted to get out of the house and pressed the garage door button this Monday morning after Xmas day with no luck.  Here I am thinking I could manually slide the door with ease ended almost breaking my back.  I sat for a moment and wondered. . . .   did Santa took my super powers away this Xmas?  little that I know, that all this time there was this metal spring that assist the sliding of this 200+ LB of hunk'n piece of metal that I called garage door.   Spring is broke and now I stuck.  Lucky for me Express Garage Door Service came to the rescue.  Brian the garage door guru came by with in 30 mins of my distress call with no extra charge.  he masterfully replaced the both springs, pulley bearings and rollers.  Yes, new silicon rollers that cuts down the sliding noise by 95%.  My dogs can testify to this, highly recommended for those late night sneaks.  :)   and by the way all of this was done with in 45 mins at a very affordable price.  Thanks Brian!

This is my new spot for my fitness needs.  Tons of instructor base and On Demand Fitness Classes are available.    Free Parking even on game day and special events.  And did i mention you get to watch the game and event for free?!  There is also a Free Shuttle Service that conveys fitness fiends from their boring cubicle to the weight room in less than 5 mins!

Whiskey Blow does not deserve a Star!!    We sat in the bar for over 30 mins and had to literally  flag down this steroid junkie bartender.  he did took our drink orders but another 15 mins went by. . . .  nothing.  not sure if he forgot or he was too busy thinking about his next testosterone cycle.  the other bartenders just look right pass us like we did not exist. The place was not even crowded.  Total waste of time!!!
