Fantastic breakfast and very good service. The cafe is also very clean. Can't wait to come back and try something new.

The night we stayed was a wedding gift from a family member. She was charged extra for a late check out when she was not supposed to and paid extra for the romance package which they did not do. They tried to charge someone elses credit card for our room and when it declined we could not check in unless we gave a credit card. Mind you this was paid for a few days earlier with a confirmation number. When they tried the phone number to fix the problem it was wrong of course so not rectified in time. My aunt had to drive down there while we were at dinner and demand things get fixed the right way with no offer to refund any amount to make her happy. The morning we checked out early and there was still a late check out fee for her and my credit card was still billed as well as hers.  We do not recommend this place at all for all the hassle you have to go thru to stay there. Oh and our room key was incorrect so after driving around, bringing all our luggage upstairs our key did not open the door so we had to go back to the front desk for another one. It was a nice gift that would have been great if it went well. I was so sorry for my aunt how embarrassing.

Unfortunately this place did not have the best food. I do not recommend the shrimp pasta, it came with super tiny canned shrimp for salads and not very many of them. I was wanting a seafood meal and this was not it. We were the youngest group in the whole restaurant but it was picked as an overall middle of the road place for a large group of people driving from all around town. The service was ok. I did not pay for the pasta dish as it was not good at all but I definitely paid $6 for the super small side salad that came with the meal. Overall I do not recommend this place although as stated in another post they have the best bread ever and the rest of the guests at our table seemed to enjoy their meals. I tasted my husband's food and it was way better than mine.
