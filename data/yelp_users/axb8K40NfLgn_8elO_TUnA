Seriously the best nail salon out there.  It is a little far from where I live, but it is definitely worth the drive There is no other place I would go to for my nails. Learned the hard way when another nail salon messed up my nails bad

Their food is really good. But their servers are horrible. Also their times are not updated and will refuse to seat you. And sometimes will just refuse to seat you when their closing time is a little over an hour later.
