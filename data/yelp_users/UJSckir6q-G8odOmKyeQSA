Called to schedule an appt at the groomers side for my cat to get groomed. She needed a rabies shot so I set her up with that appt plus the exam since it was her first (and last) time there. The girl on the phone (who forgot everything I said everytime she came back from putting me on hold) told me to take her to the vet building and they would bring her over to the groomer building after her shot & exam. Then when a girl called to confirm the appt she said 10 a.m. at the groomer and I told her that the first girl said to take her to the vet and they'd handle her first and bring her to the groomer so I was going to drop her off at the vet building. She said ok. So morning of I go to the vet building @ 10 a.m. and tell them why I'm there and the girl looks at me as if I have horns growing out of my head when I tell her i'm here to drop off my cat to get her shot and exam so that she can get groomed. She tells me I'll have to wait until she can be "checked in." I tell her I have a 10 a.m. appt but fine I will wait if it means not having to walk my howling Siamese cat back and forth outside between the 2 buildings. So i wait around for 15 min., then the manager, Dion (i think) comes to talk to me for some reason and he explains the process to me (again i seriously do not get why this was so complicated) and he says he'll put her in the back and will walk her over to the groomer when she's gotten her shot and exam. So i say okay I'll go to the groomer then and explain what I want done. So I walk around the side of the building only to see THE MANAGER RUNNING ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE VET BUILDING TO THE GROOMERS BUILDING WITH MY CAT IN THE CAT CARRIER!!! He was literally RUNNING. Had I seen him inside the building I would have lost it. & had my cat not needed a grooming very badly and no other groomer being available that day (Saturday) I would've walked right out with her. Luckily, the groomer, Brittany, was very courteous and did a great job. Now if only YOUR MANAGER would handle PEOPLE'S PETS WITH CARE then maybe I would come back. But I will never go back to your clinic and I have told all of my friends about this and will also share this on facebook. I am still dumbfounded why he would have told me to my face that he was going to "put her in the back" and then take her over to the groomer when she was done at the vet and then decided to RUN ACROSS A STREET WITH MY CAT IN THE CAT CARRIER AS IF SHE IS A DUFFEL BAG. JUST TERRIBLE.

Have ate here on a few occasions. More so closer to when it first opened when they obviously had a different chef. The last time I will ever eat here was this past Friday night when we ate there for reverse happy hour. I had to send back the squid salad because it was so salty it was inedible (they didn't even take it off the check), the calamari was also extremely salty, the sushi and seaweed salad tasted rotten (couldn't even finish the seaweed salad), and the poke tasted like regular tuna.

Tanya Tomasso has been doing my hair for almost 10 years and she is great. Jo Paris salon is clean and nice, with friendly, great service, and in a great location.  Highly recommend!
