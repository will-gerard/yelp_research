The Desert Botanical Garden    We were lucky to visit on a day with "perfect" weather, 70 degrees and partly cloudy. We even got a AAA discount on our tickets; show your card. Our visit was 5/3/15. The previous weekend the temperature had been in the upper 90's. I can't imagine visiting this garden in the summer (or spring) heat, and I live in Tucson, Arizona. If you are not from the area be aware of the Arizona sun, it is a real threat.   Visiting 5/3/15 Was a great time to visit. The wildflowers are still blooming, the cactus were blooming and the saguaros this year (super early) were starting to bloom.   A lot of people had the same idea, to visit the garden because of the unexpected cool weather, it was busy. There are a few areas of the garden where you will definitely notice the crowd on a busy day, and we were never alone. Still, it was an enjoyable half-a-day.   I asked a volunteer how long it typically took people to see the garden. When she answered two hours, I knew I had to double the time. In fact, it took me just over four hours to see "everything." Pick up a free map. It is a nice guide to the gardens.   It is a lot of walking. There are options to cut out some areas of the garden, if you would like a quicker tour. Some of the paths are paved and some are not. There are even a few wifi spots if you just can leave your technology alone.   Most of the plants are dessert plants, which is to be expected. I love dessert plants. They are so different, strange, and unique to their environment. There was also a nice herb garden.  I was impressed by the volunteers they were helpful and informative. There were also some Master Gardeners answering questions. The Master Gardner program is an impressive program. It was nice to see them set up at the Desert Botanical Garden.  The butterfly exhibit is small, but offers many types of butterflies close up and easy to photograph. I even saw two luna moths, beautiful. There is an extra $3.50 charge for non-members to see the butterflies. I thought the price was reasonable and worth it. I liked the natural light and air in the butterfly house, it really made it nice.   The butterfly exhibit was the only area it cost extra to visit. There is also a pond area with water plants and with big noisy frogs. The pond was fun to see.   It is nice, and important, to stop for a break. I had a sandwich at the Terrace Cafe it was large and good. The food at the cafe is assembled in advance, grab-and-go, so if you are the type of person that likes to leave stuff off you might want to pack your own lunch. You can also get a cup of coffee or tea at the cafe which is nice.   There is some art in the garden and it is nice, but I would love to see even more garden art added in the future.  Overall this is a very nice garden. Go see it if you are in the Phoenix area and if the weather isn't too hot. Wear sunscreen and a hat. Drink water. There are many water fountains throughout the park but bring a water bottle. This is a nice place to see desert plants. It is a beautifully maintained garden. When I visited there were many plants blooming, including some very unique ones. This is a garden I would be happy to visit again.

The Rodeo Lounge is awesome. We stayed at the attached motel (11/15/14) and came over to the bar to kill a little time before our friends' anniversary party. We just ordered a beer but they have local beer on tap and the price was great $4.00 (it might have even been less) for a pint. They have free popcorn; I love free snacks.   The bar was pretty empty. The bartender and a bar regular told us they were usually much busier on Saturdays, but they weren't busy because there were a lot of yard sales in the area. That made me smile.   Later in the evening after the party we were hanging out down the road at the much more expensive golf resort. We needed snacks. There weren't any options for food after 10pm. We called the Rodeo Lounge and their kitchen stays open late. We were able to order pizzas and chicken tenders with buffalo sauce. We picked up the food and it was good.   I would recommend the Rodeo Lounge for food or for drinks.

Quality Inn at ASU  I picked this hotel because of the location, it is within walking distance of Sleepy Dog Brewery and The Four Peaks Brewery's 8th Street location. It turns out there are a lot of restaurants within short walking distance. We also noticed a cool looking Asian Karaoke place, a pool hall, and an indoor rock climbing gym right on the edge of the parking lot. We ate breakfast in a very cute brunch spot called Salut almost right next door. However, directly  across the road is a very large power plant. I didn't mind it, but I realize some people are sensitive to power plants and industrial areas. I mention it because I didn't realize there was a large power plant across the street until I got to the hotel.  The hotel pool is small and old. I didn't use it, but I looked at it on the way to check-in. It looks like they decided to make a few parking spots into a pool area. The pool is in the parking lot right next to the main street. I think most of the photos on Yelp are from the business. They are flattering photos, but they don't match reality.   I was very happy with the location but the rest of the amenities were a letdown. This is an old worn out hotel. The people who work here seemed nice enough but we didn't have a lot of interactions, just check-in and check-out.   In the room the carpet was badly stained, I should have taken a photo, there were stains all over the room. The room seemed to be clean but it was hard to tell because it was so worn out. Our room didn't have a mini fridge. It would have been useful to have one. It also took us awhile to cool down the small room with the AC, and our stay was in May. The worst things about the room were the bed and pillows. I couldn't get comfortable. I didn't sleep well. I was unable to fall asleep for a few hours and I kept waking up.  There are other hotels in the area. I do want to come back to visit Tempe again, but I will stay somewhere else.

We stayed at this hotel New Year's Eve. This hotel has a great location. It seemed really busy and there was a big event on Mill Avenue. We were in town to see a concert at the Marquee Theatre. We took a quick 5 minute Uber ride to the Marquee and we actually just walked back to the Courtyard. It was a nice 20 minute walk across the bridges.   The bed was very comfortable and I loved the pillows. The room was spacious enough, clean, and fresh. Everything in the room was well maintained. There were plenty of towels, pillows, and blankets. The shower/tub was basic, but it worked well. The soap provided smelled nice and the shampoo worked well. The heater also worked well without making the room too hot.   Some of the other reviewers seemed to have had a real problem with noise at this hotel, but our room was quiet all night. This is more than I expected with so many New Year's revelers around. Our room was number 208 it overlooked the pool. I would recommend this room.     One thing that is a little difficult is parking at the hotel. There is only a small parking lot next to the hotel, not enough spaces. We had to park in a nearby parking garage which was a little bit of a walk especially if you are carrying your bags. The hotel charged us $8 a day for parking.   When I first arrived I had a glass of wine in the nice lobby bar area. The wine, for one glass of Chardonnay, cost $12. Why do hotels have to mark everything up?   Overall, I would stay in this hotel again, and I would recommend it.

I am not a fan of True Foods. I have eaten here twice, both times on the insistence of friends who love this place.   The restaurant is for me an awkward attempt at making something corporate more local and at making something more upscale more casual. The result is something in the middle that in my opinion doesn't really work. When our server tried to introduce us to the concept, when he first approached our table, it felt very corporate, forced, and fake.   The actual restaurant space is loud, so it is hard to have a conversation with anyone who isn't seated right next to you. On this last visit we had a table of six and it was very hard to hear everyone.   The first time I ate here I had the soup to start and a fish entree. The portions are small for the price.   On our most recent visit we started with the tofu lettuce wraps they have a very strong flavor. For dinner I had the bison burger, on the recommendation of our friends. It just wasn't for me. I didn't eat the top part of the bun. It was a little too dry and way too garlicky. The garlic might have also been in the sides. As a side I had half sweet potatoes and half kale. I usually like kale but this kale was really tough, hard to eat and hard to digest. There was nothing really wrong with the food I just didn't like it.   I order a glass-and-a-half of Rioja; I like that they serve the wine in this portion. It is a perfect amount to have with dinner. However, the wine itself wasn't something I would order again.    On both of our visits the service was slow. Be prepared for a drawn-out dinner.   Overall, True Foods isn't a place that I would personally recommend.

This is a great place to drink a beer. We were so happy we found this brewery. I hadn't heard much about them, but they were relatively close to another brewery we were visiting so we stopped in. We had the best time.   The taproom is located right off the brewery. There are windows that allow you to see into the brewery. This is a large brewery with a bottling line and a canning line. They share the taproom with Sonoran Brewery. Sonoran makes a white chocolate beer that is really unbelievable.   This is a no-frills taproom with a helpful, friendly staff. We also enjoyed taking with a few of the other customers. This is a friendly place.   There are many beers to try and flights are $5.00. We picked the beer we wanted to sample and then had our growler filled with a Saison. Phoenix Ale made this beer for the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas. It is fennel and peppercorn infused, delicious and different.   Because it was Sunday we got a growler fill and a pint for $10. They were nice and counted our flight as a pint so that we could get the special.   We also bought a 6-pack of Orange Peel IPA and a 6-pack of the white chocolate beer. We added a souvenir pint glass for $5.   They have great prices for their beer. I love it when the beer costs less where it was made than it cost in the store; that is the way it should be. We were super happy and left with a cooler full of beer.   They have a lot of great merchandise. If you like collecting brewery t-shirts or growlers you will like the selection.   They don't give tours any more on Sundays because they are busier in the taproom. However, we plan on coming back on a weekday to get a quick tour while the line is running.   Good prices, good people, good beer, we will be back. We have been telling everyone about Phoenix Ale Brewery. This should be on your short list of breweries to visit in Arizona.

Salut   We had breakfast here on a Sunday. We sat inside. It was a little chilly outside but there was already a crowd enjoying the patio. The food items on the menu are limited but this is a restaurant with multiple drink menus. The decor is trendy and inviting. This is a very cute wine bar. They have these amazing mirrors framed in cut wine bottles. I loved the mirrors.   For breakfast I just had coffee and water but the brunch cocktails were very tempting. The water they serve is infused with cucumbers and very refreshing. I love the cut wine bottle drinking glasses. I ordered the Florentine Benedict to share. I usually find eggs Benedict so heavy that I can only eat half of a two egg portion. At Salut the portions are fancy and small. I could have eaten the whole meal and then some. Good thing we ordered an extra side of fruit and that we were trying not to overeat.    The funny thing is that we did order a breakfast dessert. It is fun to be on vacation. For dessert we had the chef's special dessert it was a French toast with banana ice cream. It was tasty but I could have gone without it.   This is a great spot to go for a drink and a fancy snack. Just don't go to Salut expecting or wanting big food portions.   If I lived in the area I would definitely come back to Salut. It looks like they have some great wine specials. They also have a nice patio and bar. Salut has a lot going for it. I am glad I got the chance to have a meal here.

I really enjoyed this tour. I will start by saying, if you like bourbon, and if you don't like a tour with a lot of walking or standing around, then this tour is for you. The tour takes place in one room, you essentially just keep turning around as your guide moves from step to step.   I really appreciate small local quality products. Right now the owner (who gave us our tour) is Arizona Distilling's only full time employee. The owner is a Tempe native and works Arizona history in to his product ideas and product names. The Four Peaks Brewery guys helped him get started. Those are some good friends to have.    I learned a lot about Arizona history, and distilling on this tour. We got to sample the moonshine, bourbon, and gin. Detailed explanations were given with each sample. Arizona Distilling's gin has won a major award, beating out Bombay Sapphire, and Hendrick's Gin. If you would like to try the specialty whiskeys you can buy shots for $5 each.   This is a great tour, but go take it now because the business will be moving to a new undetermined location. We learned Arizona Distilling's next project will be a restaurant project. I am looking forward to learning what is in store for this new small business.
