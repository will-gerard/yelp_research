Let me start off by saying that I have the biggest obsession with boba. If you don't know what that is, boba is like these little tapioca balls. They are delicious.   I first came here April 3, 2014 while going home from the Welfare office with my mom. She told me that she had seen a girl drinking a slush with boba in it and that girl said she had gotten it from Rainbow Donuts. I asked my mom if we can try it so we ended up going there.  The outside of this place is really small and the inside is pretty empty. From that, I thought that their boba drinks would be shitty since nobody ever came here, but I was oh so wrong. The wait wasn't that long compared to other boba places. To my surprise, the boba was perfectly chewy and just right. I ordered a honeydew snow blended drink. It was great! Other boba places I've tried out here in Phoenix had really hard boba. This place really had me hooked.   This evening I ordered a Peaches and Cream snow blended drink with boba and it was on point! The prices are affordable and the quality is outrageous. One con I would bring up is the way the lady blended it. I found huge pieces of ice in mine, but I kind of didn't mind since I love chewing on it.   Overrall, I feel that everyone who loves boba drinks should definitely give this place a try. You really won't be disappointed. I will be back very soon to try more flavors.  P.S. You guys should add more flavors.. I love variety!

I went here Friday night August 23, 2013. I walked in, was greeted with great service, and led to the take out area. I knew it would be crowded (which it was) so I ordered before I got there. It was night time and that's usually when there's a lot of people. When I got there, I had to wait an extra five minutes, but I didn't mind because it was a busy night. I bought a Rock N Roll and it was delicious. I was disappointed to see that it wasn't that much as to what I expected. It was a really small portion. Maybe it was because I ordered for take out and they wanted it to fit in the box, but that really bummed me out. I paid $12. I guess I did get my money's worth because it was so good, but I would really love more Sushi pieces next time. There was only six. Shoot, I have a large appetite. Tomo needs to step their game up. I'm going to come back here and stay to eat one day. I really love this place and everyone should try it if they have not already. Best sushi in Goodyear!

Another great experience here at Tomo. This time I got to try the Phoenix roll and Sunset roll. Both were amazing. I'm going to leave this review short because by the amount of stars given, you can already get an idea of how great this place is. Try Tomo if you haven't already!

I really don't like Sonic. People hype it up to be the best fast food out there, but it's really nothing special. High prices, long waits- Not worth it. We specifically asked for no pickles on two of the burgers and there were indeed pickles on them. Paid damn near $30 for mediocre food. Kinda ridiculous if you ask me.  The one thing I absolutely love about Sonic though is their mozzarella sticks and the happy hour slushes. Other than that, I'd definitely choose another place over this.

To be honest, I mainly only come to Wingstop on Mondays and Tuesdays because of their 60 cents boneless wings. Wingstop is a delicious food place, but I'm a cheap person who loves deals so... Yeah!  I've tried the original hot and lemon pepper boneless wings. They're seriously amazing. If you haven't tried them, well.. You need to. I intend on trying all the flavors. I have a long way to go though. Heads up, the original hot flavor was too hot for me and I love spicy foods. I'm afraid that I won't be able to handle the other spicier flavors haha. I still want to try them.. Anyways, their seasoned idaho potato fries are the bomb. Those fries are another reason why I love going to Wingstop.   If everyday was Monday and Tuesday, let's just say I'd be here everyday.   Wingstop is the best!

I always come here to get my eyebrows and upper lip waxed. They always do it perfectly. It's $12 for both, but if you want your upper lip done by itself it is $5. Eyebrows is $8. Anyways... This place is always busy so they must be doing something right, right? This morning I came in to take my little sister's friend to get a pedicure and I'd have to say I was satisfied. Well, for the most part. The price for a regular pedicure is $17. She got a regular pedicure and a design on each of her big toe. The reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because when the lady was finished with her nails she just took off. We waited for like 10 minutes hoping she would come back, but I guess she didn't. We had to ask for somebody's assistance so we can pay. They really should have someone at the front desk because I really am an impatient person. Overall though, this place is great and if you're looking to get your nails done or get waxed, this is the one!

Their food is over priced, but worth it all. Everything about this place is amazing. Their bathroom is spotless and the inside of this place is ridiculously clean. I love how all the sauces, napkins, utensils are right there for you instead of having to ask the workers. Omg! Their chick-fil-a sauce is so good!!!   If ever you see a chick-fil-a, don't drive pass it. You all need to get a taste of the good life! This place is literally heaven.

Today was the first time I ate In-N-Out here in Arizona and I'm proud to say that it was delicious. I've never been a fan of burgers, but In-N-Out was always the exception when I lived in California. It's something about the buns that make it so yummy. Anyways, I ordered a #2: a cheeseburger, fries, and a medium drink. Of course I animal styled them fries. Mm! So mouth watering. Their pink lemonade is really great too. If you're ever here, definitely give it a try.  The prices are so affordable. I never really checked out the prices when I used to live in California because I was never the one to buy the food so I never noticed how cheap everything is. I mean, it's seriously affordable. The meal is about $5.30 (+ tax) which is a normal meal price I guess, but the quality of the food is just perfect that you truly get your money's worth.  Another thing I love about this place is the staff. They are so sweet and outgoing. They're awesome! Anyone who is reading this must stop by at this In-N-Out and enjoy a delightful meal with friends or family.

When I come to nail salons it's never to get my nails done. I come from a family of two licensed cosmetologists so I only trust my cousin and my grandma to do my nails.   I only come to nail salons to get my eyebrows and upperlip waxed. Though I haven't gotten my upperlip waxed here yet, the sweet lady who did my eyebrows did an amazing job. She was really nice and we had a lot to talk about. I loved that because I hate awkward silences.   Coming to Superior Nails I assumed that the cost of getting my eyebrows waxed would be $8-$10 because that's usually the amount of other places I've been to have cost. To my surprise, it was only $7. Now that's what I'm talking about. $7 for a perfect eyebrow wax? I'm hooked. This is definitely my new go to place.  The store is very clean inside as well. I love it. I don't know if they do nails great, but I wanna say they do because the times I've came here all the ladies seemed to have been satisfied. Give this place a try. You might just be in for a surprise. I know I was.  P.S. I'm actually going there right now to get my eyebrows done. Lately I haven't had time to write a well thought out review, but today I was so here it is. Stop by if you ever have a chance!
