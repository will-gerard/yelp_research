We went to dinner here last night to celebrate my parents 28th wedding anniversary & this is one of their favorite places to eat. We waited forever to get seated even though we used the call ahead method. We were told we'd wait about 10-20 mins and ended up waiting about 45mins, that's the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. First off, our waiter Matthew was amazing! Right from the get go he was so nice and attentive, made sure we had everything we needed and even brought my son an extra coloring book and crayons. The food was really good and everything was cooked to perfection. I tend to nitpick when it comes to my food and I  had NO complaints! Our waiter Matthew even gave us some free rolls to bring home :) . If you're looking for a place with amazing service & great food this is the place to go, it's worth the wait!

Worst church's chicken EVER. I'm new to the avondale area so I figured I'd try the nearest church's chicken. BIG mistake. I was literally in line for 45 mins and when we got up to the window, there were 3 girls standing around talking. We got home only to find out that they forgot all of our biscuits. Worst part, the chicken was disgusting. It was the toughest piece of chicken I've ever had. I took 1 bite and didn't touch the rest b/c it didn't even look like it was cooked right. I didn't even feed that chicken to my dog. I will NEVER go back to this location & the manager will be getting an ear full tomorrow morning.

Omg so good! The pastries are delicious and the cherry cheesecake is outta this world! The workers are really friendly too which is a plus. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was b/c they didn't have macaroons, but everything was delicious and I will be def be going back :)

I LOVE this place!!! The food is excellent and the workers are so nice. I always get the same thing, the Oaxaca burrito which is amazing and a taco which is also really good, hence why I get the same thing every time lol. I've also tried the red & green chili which are really good too. I have nothing bad to say about this place just go and try it NOW!

The 1st time I came here I hated it. It probably had to do with the fact that I got noodles w/teriyaki which is pretty much disgusting lol. This time around I got brown rice with chicken and broccoli and the house sauce. AMAZING! Would def come back again
