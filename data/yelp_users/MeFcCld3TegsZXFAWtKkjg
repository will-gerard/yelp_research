The service started out great until we got our appetizers then the waitress completely disappeared. We sat there for 10 minutes after we had finished our appetizers with empty drinks before she came back to put in our order. When we received our food it was less then ok. The risotto was under cooked and the lamb was over cooked. Not a great combination. Great place to grab a drink and a mediocre appetizer. Would recommend for happy hour not dinner.

Horrible customer service. I'm not sure how the photo supervisor got the job because he has no social skills. The store is convenient but after having 4 awful experiences I will make the trip up to walgreens where I have only received great customer service. Thanks for the let down CVS.

Only person in line. 6 associates working and it takes 20 minutes to make a fruit bowl. Seriously the slowest service. Manager and employees have no urgency and continued to talk while I stood here waiting.
