Worst service ever !! Please don't go here ! This place doesn't maintain hygiene standards , we found a stapler pin inside Tofu !!! My friend realized it when the pin was in her mouth .. After this owner today even apologized and blamed it on the tofu itself .. One more weird thing in this restaurant is that you can't food here you would have to pay extra 2$ if you do so !!!! Servers are super rude ..

I went here seeing 4.5 stars at yelp . This restaurant is not even 1 star . Food is terrible & service is worst. They offer only plain naan , neither rotis nor garlic naan . Appetizers samosas pakoras were not fresh , must be previous days left overs . Do yourself a favor and go to mint for a satisfying indian buffet.

With the groupon for 3 big kahuna wash it's  a great deal . Quality of wash is decent ... They give 2 day rain check which is cool ..

I have been to almost every other Indian restaurant in valley .. Chutneys is just 2 blocks away from my home , I really loved this place when it had just got opened with owner taking  care of every table personally,service was good food was good .. But now I am afraid with no owners present in restaurant waiters are handling it terribly .. I went there around 8.40 at night . Waitress came at my table at 8.55 when I was almost about to leave I ordered my food pretty regular dosa and it got to my table at 9.30 with a message they are closing soon so give final orders.also their menu has shrinked like anything earlier they used to have all the common dishes now nothing . Even dishes in menu are not avail , why is it in menu then ?? Their staff is same as it was for Krishna cafe , 2 waitresses are not rude but they don't care either and the guy who takes order is so rude he acts as if people have come in his wedding for free food ... Would not recommend it at all unless you can wait for an hour for your dish ...

Updating my review which I had written months back . This place has great food , I had combo gobi munchurian & fried rice . It was delicious , indo Chinese at this place is much better than newly opened indo Chinese restaurant in scottsdale . Service is good too . I had a chat with the other owner and he was telling me they are going to add more dishes to menu . I am looking forward to try those .
