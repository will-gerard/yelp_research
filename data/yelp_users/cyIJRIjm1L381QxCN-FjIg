I am a fan of affordable lunch prices for quality food and was told they have great lunch options at an affordable price.  While yes, the food was correctly priced, I was not a fan of the food itself.  I ordered a regular orange chicken with fried rice. The portion was a great size. However, the chicken looked and tasted like it was fried yesterday and the fried rice had no semblance of "crispy"ness that you want from fried rice.   The rice looked like white rice with a little soy sauce on it and had absolutely no flavor. Customary fried rice ingredients include eggs, carrots and other veggies, but this had one small bite of carrot pieces and nothing else to keep me from diving in. No seasoning, no flavor.  The chicken, which was dark meat, had an overly chewy texture compared to ordinary dark meat. The fry on the chicken, as I alluded to earlier, was old, disgusting and left an unfortunate taste in my mouth. Worst of all, it felt "heavy" and it still is sitting in my stomach.  I threw out my lunch because if I wanted day old fried chicken with an unflavorful sauce on it, I would have gone to a supermarket.  UPDATE: thankfully I was able to abort the food from my stomach with heavy doses of ipecac.

A buddy of mine introduced me to this place about a year ago. Since then, it has become one of my favorite sushi spots. The nigiri is fresh, the rolls are well made and they offer something no other sushi place has: Jalapeño Tempura Rolls.   Jalapeños hollowed out and battered in tempura, stuffed with spicy tuna and an eel sauce drizzled on top. Just writing that last sentence makes my mouth water. No other place has an appetizer quite like it.   Good service, romantic ambiance and convenient if you live close by.   Ultimately, it's a great hole in the wall with a nice evening happy hour and an awesome date night location. Highly recommended!

If you work/live anywhere in Mesa, this is the Go-To place for lunch. I have been here numerous times and each time the quality of the food amazes me. I get their Chicken lunch bowl specials (substitute white meat for $1 extra) with a drink for $9.  The portion is generous, with freshly grilled chicken on a bed of the best white rice I have had outside of a fine-dining restaurant. All of this topped in a sweet teriyaki sauce. In one word, it is amazing! Add on some Sriracha sauce and a touch of soy sauce and for the next 12-15 minutes, your stomach and face will be smiling.  If this is your first time going, try their lunch specials and go from there. Their sushi is also fresh, but not my number choice if I have a craving for it. Their Katsu plate is also dynamite (thinly sliced fried chicken strips with a Katsu sauce on the aforementioned white rice.  I highly recommend this place as a hangout spot with friends or a casual date. Did I mention the White Rice is amazing?

The other reviewers have no earthly idea what they are talking about. Let me debunk some things right now.  Yes, it was $10 to get in. Yes, you had to buy food tickets and NO there was no fee for parking. If you paid for parking, you got swindled. Plain and simple.  Most importantly, there were 50, yes FIFTY food trucks on hand. Not 15, not 20, but 50. I went both days and went early, so I avoided the long lines and sampled as much delicious food as possible.  Believe me Yelpers, the negative press this event is receiving is unwarranted. 2012's Event was worthy of 1 star as there were half as many food trucks and twice as many in line waiting. The Street Eats Festival redeemed itself.  Butter Poached Lobster Grilled Cheese was amazing. The Brie Melt from the Grilled Cheese Truck was creamy and had a touch of sweetness from the honey. The Montana BBQ was juicy and packed with an interesting mix of spices and Award-winning BBQ sauce.  There is almost NO way to give this place a negative review unless you didn't want to go to begin with. I look forward to 2014's event and will be purchasing VIP Tickets.  Great Job Everyone!
