DO NOT GO HERE! NOT CLEAN! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! My wife and I sat down for their lunch buffet. Both of us had sushi. As I was finishing my meal, my wife found an ant crawling on her salmon.  She showed the waitress and she said she was done. So the waitress brought our bill. Not only did she not comp our meal, but she brought us someone else's check for 3 people. When she brought us the correct check, she was still charging for both of us. After we made a stink, she said I can take 10% off (meanwhile there are ants crawling around in my stomach) I asked for the manager. He agreed to take off my wife's meal but not mine, saying he can't give everyone free food. I get that, but the fact that he has ants and who knows what else crawling over his raw fish and he still wanted to charge me? Unacceptable.

Unfortunately Chris R doesn't know what a soft opening is.  How do you give 2 stars to a place that isn't technically open yet? This restaurant was working out the kinks. It was a work in progress to get ready for the grand opening. Things won't be perfect. I know this place uses the freshest ingredients and judging by the menu it seems as if the owner has worked hard to provide us with a menu that has something for people with all kinds of food issues.  This is an innovative concept that will revolutionize the food industry as we know it.  Hats off to the Nourish Team. I look forward to your future success.
