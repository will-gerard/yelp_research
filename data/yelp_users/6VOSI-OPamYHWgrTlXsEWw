Liz is amazing! Such a wonderful person and business owner! The way she treats her clients is unheard of now a days. I highly recommended that if anyone is looking for a great groomer, puff and fluff will treat your beloved pet like royalty.

This is the second time I've been to this location and both experiences were horrible! The first time my waiter was a complete hipster douchebag who made me feel like an idiot because I didn't know what bottomless mimosas were, innocently I've never heard that term so I did what any inquisitive person would do and asked. Was he nice about it? No! He teased me the whole time and posted it on Facebook where his loser hipster buddies can laugh at me. Second was when I was summoned to a business meeting with a new client. The dinner was nice and the service was better this time, however, at the end of my meal as I'm ready to pay I notice a chewed up piece of bubblegum on top of my plate. I asked everyone at the table and seriously doubt a new client of mine would dare place their chewed up gum on my plate. The manager spoke to us and very apologetic and as I was leaving he handed me a gift card for $10. I guess I'm not hipster and loser enough to dine at The Vig in downtown.
