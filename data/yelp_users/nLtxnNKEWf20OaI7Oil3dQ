Horrible service. I bought a $400 belt for a buddy of mine for his birthday and he went the next day to get a bigger size, never wore it or even really touched it. They told him they couldn't exchange it because it seemed a bit bent like if it was worn.  Moreover, the customer "service" salesperson brought the belt into the back room and came back with an obvious new hole in the belt. She said that we did it, even though they gift wrap the box and we didn't even touch it after buying it and it was brought back the same day!  Despicable store. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Blatant fraudsters won't even give you any service. I will not let this go lightly.

I am such a big fan of LGO that I moved in down the street - literally. Parking was often an issue (because it's so popular) that I decided I would move within walking distance so that I could have amazing LGO coffee every morning.   I recommend the coffee and the salted chocolate chip cookie. They also have amazing pizza, but that is enough for another review.

Summary for A.D.H.D readers:  * Tomato soup is the best I have ever had * The restaurant was lonely and located in a shady area * The server was very kind, but a little pushy on insisting drinks and dessert * The gyro meat was a little too greasy for my taste, but everything else tasted fresh * Fast service, clean tables, and authentic Greek music playing * Prices range from $12+ for entrees, but they are large portions and come with soup   Full Review:  Yes, the tomato soup is the best I've ever had.  The restaurant is located in a shady area, but I was not too intimidated since it was right on the side of the street and well-lit.  Upon entering, I was shocked that there weren't more people eating there. In fact, we were the only ones in there. We waited around awkwardly until someone sat us and then we were greeted by a 75+ year old server, who I assume is one of the owners.  We ordered tomato soup, a gyro plate, diet pepsi, and baklavas for dessert. It didn't seem like business was going too well. The server was a little pushy on the up-sells (the drink and the dessert).   The soda was in a smaller cup than I am used to. While we waited for food, we also took sips of the water, which was pretty good.   The soup arrived in less than 3-5 minutes. I originally ordered the lentil soup, but was very happy they brought me tomato instead. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the best tomato soup I have ever tasted in my life. Lots of flavor and smelled amazing. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, our food plates arrived and it looked delicious.   The pita bread was plenty and they were all warm. I like my pita bread warm and soft. This pita bread was on point. To be honest, the gyro meat strips were a little too greasy for my liking, but they tasted GREAT dipped into the tomato soup.  The rice was well cooked and a great compliment to the tzatziki sauce, which was tangy and refreshing. After we devoured our meal, we felt more than stuffed. But, the waiter insisted we have dessert and even coffee. We agreed on getting baklavas for dessert. We passed on the coffee.  The baklavas were $2.50 each, were smaller than usual, but were overall pretty good. I'm not too sure they were made on location though. I recommend it for those looking for an authentic Greek food experience that have the time and budget for more than a fast food Greek experience.

Incredible fruit/veggie selection at unbeatable prices (literally).  It's a bit of a drive and can get busy at certain times of the day, but it's worth it if you're doing a juice cleanse or juice daily (and smoothies). I wish there were more organic choices and some of the items can be very ripe (expire in 1 day).

Hair in food, cold tortillas and powdered drinks. This is NOT right. And the staff is rude, the plaza is very ghetto and sketchy at night, plus eating there is a risk with their very outdated, dirty tables. Too many other choices, so I will never return.

Horrible service. No chips, no service, no nothing. Just waited for 15 minutes. I am so sad that this place has gone down so much. I have never experienced a lack of service as I did today. I do not recommend this location to anyone. Go to another nearby Mexican restaurant - maybe you'll at least get noticed there.

Go to another location. Don't eat here!  Literally the worst tropical smoothie location in Arizona. The cashiers must be from the Hills Have Eyes casting or they just are stoned beyond belief. They mumble and avoid eye contact every time I order.  I thought it was just the cashiers that were bad, but the management might be even worse. Aside from awkward jokes and taking 18 minutes to bring out my ONE sandwich, I now understand why the front line employees are like sacks of potatoes - they are trained by these God-awful managers.  My smoothie tasted like ice with a splash of spinach. I ordered it from other locations and it was fine, but of course, this location messes that up too. I'm sad, since this is the nearest location to my home, but it's worth driving a few miles to get away from this disaster. I really hope they can close down or change management FAST.

Amazing same day service from A1. I was very pleased with their fast and friendly technicians. I strongly recommend this company for anything garage related.  By the way, they beat all competitor pricing I found online.

I ordered the basil burger and it was very juicy and well-cooked. The onions and mushrooms were not too soft. I actually enjoyed the little pasta salad that came with the meal.   Expect to spend $10-15 for lunch. Also, they have a rewards program that is worth joining. You get a $15 credit for every $100 spent. Not bad!

Lots of seating with no wait. The brisket was very juicy and fresh. I enjoyed a $2.50 beer too. Overall, I recommend this place if you want some juicy brisket and baby back ribs. The price is about the same you'd pay at another BBQ joint.   The meat is wrapped, which scared me at first, but it locks in the flavor pretty nicely. I really enjoyed the barbecue sauce and the pickles were really good.

the Kelly Warner law firm always delivers great results. They are surprisingly almost always available via Skype/phone/email. That is why I remain a client of theirs. Most of all, they speak tech/internet marketing and they got to work immediately on my case. These guys are the real deal.

Very authentic food delivered by friendly staff. This is the real deal. They own the place next door, but I haven't tried it yet. Not sure why people get so confused that they have the same owner.  Anyway, I strongly recommend the beef Pho and the mango+ginger smoothie. Phenomenal.
