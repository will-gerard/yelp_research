Really like this place. Can't believe it took me this long to notice this little gem in my neighborhood. Great service and food to the crab burger is a delicious item. Their brioche buns are buttery and crispy and the crab cake in the middle came out hot and full of flavor. Cannot give a full 5 until I experience the dinner menu.

The service here is top notch. The servers have to be the friendliest and most helpful I have experienced in a long time. I wish I lived in Arcadia this place would definitely be my hang out. I have to give a shout out to the Lauren's. They made my first experience here make me want to come back (it's not because of their pretty looks they legitimately have the best attitudes and service that I have experienced in a while) if you get a chance come check this place out.

I hate doing bad reviews, seriously. I came in for take out and the servers were very pleasant. Let me get to the point that the food was horrible. I had the General Tso's pork  (which I was told it was really nice) being a culinary student myself I hate to talk badly about another's food.so I will say that I will give this place one more shot so  please get better .

I am not that versed in Caribbean cuisine, but if this is a true representation of the that region then I am going to try and seek out all that I can experience. I have been to this place quite a few times but this is my first on Yelp with them. First of all the staff at the place is so friendly and nice. Always helpful and super courteous. I have only had three dishes from here, the Jerk Chicken, Chicken Fricasee, and Goat Curry. And I must say typing those words made my mouth water. The sweet and spicy herbs and spices they use on the Fricasee and the Jerk are so delicious and complex that as a former chef I am enthralled with how they come up with such flavors. When you oder a meal you get a choice of white rice or red beans and rice. Then you get your choice of gravy on the rice. I always get the Goat Curry gravy. Then there is a nice little surprise of a cabbage mix that is surprisingly hearty and plantains that are cooked perfectly.I will go back to this place over and over. I think the Oxtail soup is next for me to try.

A cool idea for sandwiches. Toasted, circular, and sealed. Fantastic service. Very friendly. Had an egg frittata sandwich with feta, bacon, ham, Parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, and basil. It was really tasty, can't wait to try the lunch sandwiches.

Absolutely love this place. Went to this amazing place for the first time three years ago. Even since I got back from living in Italy for 3.5 years I've been searching for authentic Italian pizza that I grew to love during my long stay there. Then sommelier at school told me about Pomo. I decided to give it a try. The first time I looked at the menu I knew this place was legit. I saw my favorite pizza from Italy the capricciosa. Of course I ordered it and wow I finally found what I had been searching for all that time.  All though it can seem pricey to some people but people have to realize the ingredients that have to be imported from Italy to make these bad boys. Hell real San Marazano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella are not cheap imports. This is one of my favorite places to take family and friends when they come in town. The staff and the owners are so friendly and make you feel like family. If you haven't tried this place you owe it to yourself to go.
