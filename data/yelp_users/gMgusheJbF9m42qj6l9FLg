For the kind of fast causal place that it is, it deserves 5 stars in that category. Fast and fantastic food!

My fiancé and I had dinner there last night and we loved it! We have been a few times and it is our favorite bbq place to splurge if we don't make it ourselves. Drinks are always great and service very friendly. I am a huge fan of their BEEF ribs, some of the best I've ever had. Their sides and biscuits are exceptional. My fiancé had a BBQ platter, chicken was wonderful but the tri tip was on the dry side. The only thing that was frustrating was the small scoop of ice cream for her birthday we received. Usually restaurants offer one of their deserts. We will be back, we love it! Only down side is the inflated cost... A bit over priced.

Full bar, One of the best in Vegas. Partly because of the food and the ambiance, but mostly because of the staff. Everyone was helpful, knowledgeable and more importantly all around fun! It was easy to spend hours there just drinking and having a good time before going out to the clubs. Britney was by far the best, between her original custom drinks, she was just so much fun and took care of everyone! If this review hasn't persuaded you to give this place a try, at least give it a shot for Britney! She'll make sure you have a good time and you'll end up coming back.

This is a great place to get a quick wash and the staff is always very friendly and attentive. Today I purchased a fast pass, Shawn is the guy who I purchased through. Shawn was upbeat, kind, courteous, and did a great job selling the product and the brand. I'm in business development and sales for healthcare so it's hard to sell to a sales man.... Shawn did a heck of a job and I look forward to my new fast pass!

I along with two friends tried Thai Chili 2 Go because we wanted some good Thai food and fast. I ordered the Pad Thai, the others order the Pad Siew... one with chicken and the other beef. We all were disappointed in our meals so we decided to try one anothers, but honestly we could not tell the difference. Each dish was mushy and had way too much sauce... all we could taste was sugar.  We will most likely not be coming back
