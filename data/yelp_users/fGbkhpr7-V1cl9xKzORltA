I am in full agreement with others about the equipment condition. Though I get a good workout because of the variety, there are MANY repair issues as evident in all the "broken signs" that seem to stay on the machines forever. Even machines that work could use maintenance. I had been a member 10 years ago and will say that when I came back 5 months ago because of my daughters request, it was a deja vu.....NOTHING has changed.   As for cleanliness, the place could use a really good cleaning especially the bathrooms. There are many customers at this location so I cannot imagine the repair/cleanliness issue is to blame on financial reasons.  This is obviously a poorly managed location and I have written to corporate 2 months ago with no reply.

Yuck. Wife and I have been to this place a handful of times over the 19 years we lived nearby. We certainly know it is a dive bar and were in the mood for one drink.....at a dive bar.  When we sat down, I said to the wife that it looks like they have not spent one dollar on upgrading or cleaning since we first came in 19 years later. So we ask the bartender lady about the happy hour (Sat night) specials and they are pretty reasonable. I get a a well vodka tonic and the wife a big draft.  Drinks served. As soon as I took my first sip, I was hit with the grossest odor from my drink imaginable. The only way to describe it is if you have worked under your sink and removed the p-trap. That was the smell. I asked my wife to check it out and she almost threw up. Trust me, we are not wimps or over reaching yuppies.   I called the bartender lady over and told her my drink smells really bad and will take a beer. I also asked her if she would at least smell it as well so she could maybe figure out which of the 3 ingredients might be causing the smell....ice, vodka or tonic water. She said, no I do not need to and dumped the drink out. WTF....you would think she may want to find out the source of the issue. I did not make a big deal of the situation when I spoke to her and kept it friendly but was surprised that she did not care at all. I feel sorry for the next person who ordered the same drink. Had the girl checked out the drink and cared at all as to what may be causing the odor, I would not have written this.   Lastly, our seats at the bar had a great view of the sinks and equipment behind the counters and to be quite frank, I cannot believe this place can pass a food inspection.   Word to the owner(s)...read these reviews and use it as a lesson on success going forward. It is for your own good.

Wow. This place is TERRIBLE if you like to take photos. They are so restrictive with their photo policy and even have a village idiot that monitors you. I felt like we were at the North Korean "Friendship" Gardens.   Of course they are happy to take $150 for 2 hours from you if you would like to bring in your camera with a tripod. What a deal! I wish I could say I made up that number but I can't. The lady at the money TAKING booth jumps all over you when she sees you have a camera. She certainly did not pass any personality exam to get her job.   Save your money, the place was pretty boring beside this stupid photo policy and take your money to the Phoenix Zoo instead.   Oh yeah.....we ended up taking our damn cameras in anyhow...like it or not!!

Great Pizza. Anytime we have friends over we either go to eat there or pick up from there. Try his subs as well as the pizza. All around great place for a casual night out. Keep up the genuine personality Victor.

Do not go here. If you do, you will ruin my secret haunt. The family and I sneak out here many weekends. Great food, reasonable prices. You can just about show up in your pajamas if you like.

The situation... Daughters prom dress zipper rips 2 days before prom and still needs to be taken in and hemmed. Since the next day is my day off, wife gives me the task of getting this all fixed. I tried calling a number of places that would not commit to this until it dawned on me that my dry cleaner, Catalina Cleaners in Chandler had a seamstress on site. I decide to stop in and the woman gladly accepted the task which was done in about 2 hours. I am now a hero to my wife and daughter(s). This place rocks customer service that is above and beyond.

The beer and most of the food is great. However, the wife and I were in the mood for pizza and I suggested we try one at SanTan Brewing. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.   The pizza came as we enjoyed some of their great beers. My first thought was that it was the wrong pizza. It did not look like there was any chicken on it. After spotting a couple bumps under the cheese we gave it a try. What a letdown. It had so little chicken, very little buffalo flavor and the crust was mushy in the center. I have become spoiled by the Buffalo Chicken Pizza at a nearby pizza joint, Nicantoni's.  We were pretty silent about the pizza till the wife asked what I thought. I rarely have a strong opinion and lean toward being nice but could not help myself on this one. This pizza is NOT a winner.  Though this will not stop me from going to Santan since I know they do a decent job on many other items, atmosphere and beer. Lesson learned that when in the mood for pizza stick to what you already know is a winner......you local pizza joint.

Late night stop in with the wife on Saturday night and there were 4 guys working the bar area. The place was not to crowded for a Saturday night so I was a little surprised to be ignored. Finally the tall guy with dark hair came and acknowledged us, served the beers and provided the bill since we were only there for one round. Pretty decent guy. $18 bar tab so I figured I would put $5 on for tip.   No sooner do I lay the pen down then the Mr. Rude Dude bald goatee bartender grabs it and rings it out. No acknowledgement whatsoever when taking or seeing the tip. He goes about his way to then help the next group. I could over hear the conversation and whatever the woman ordered he said, "how about the Apple Cider" which was some drink on tap...."it is easier to make than the drink". Sounding a bit on the lazy side if you ask me.  Now don't get me wrong, I know that places like this pool their tips, but it annoys the hell out of me to put a little extra down in the tip area for the person that served you all to have someone else take the tab away and the original person having no idea of your generosity. Freaking Rude.   After watching Mr. Rude Dude for then next 15 minutes it was blatantly obvious he was there to shuffle in the register as many tabs as he could. Maybe he needs to return to working at the traveling carnival where that behavior is expected.

decent food and atmosphere. The downside is sitting there watching the Gilbert Police pull people over on Gilbert Road as they leave the main entrance into that shopping area. In the course of just over an hour there were 3 cars pulled over.  Once again the Barney Fifes of Gilbert ruin business for a great place. I will not go back there just to end up being a target of the GPD.

Yuck.  I had time before an event at the Convention Center so figured I would stop in for a slice of pizza and beer on a weekend day. The place was pretty busy. When you stand in line next to the pizza behind the glass, you kind of think you should order from that person making the pizza. NOT. They do not even acknowledge you. You get to the register then order. Girl in front of me was certainly confused by this as well.   I get a pepperoni slice and beer, go outside to eat and when I lifted the pizza, so much oil came off it I felt like I was on a hidden camera show. The slice was completely like a wet rag and flopping over. On top of that the cornmeal or whatever it was on the bottom was all burned. It made my fingers look like I was picking up coal.  so I finished this mess of a pizza and go to throw away my stuff and the big round open barrel, the kind you buy at Lowes for landscaping is completely full and a mound on the top existed for you to add your plate to.....very carefully so you do not knock off other trash to the ground.  It amazes me that a place that only serves slices and beer cannot get that right. I venture to guess they will be out of business the next time I am downtown.

Very modern, friendly and fantastic food. I am fortunate to work close by and stop in often. The manager/owner is very friendly. Overall great experience.
