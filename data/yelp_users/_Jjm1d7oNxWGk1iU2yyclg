This place is the best!  Amazing customer service and excellent selection of threads.  I even needed to get a dress tailored for my date the day before and they fixed it right on the spot.  Best part.... Wait for it.... They didn't even charge me.  I a big city it is rare to find this level of service and care.  I really appreciate everyone there for going out of there way to always take good care of me.

Horrible service.  Terrible.  I will never bring my family here again.  They messed up not only our bday party but the food was cold and my brother got sick afterward.  I'm sure it was just a mistake but the overall opinion here is bad.

Great pizza but more importantly awesome family environment.  Every time I have ate here it has the feeling of family and that's not and easy accomplishment these days.

This is one of my "Cheers".  Best place in the valley to get a smoke and a drink.  Great selection on sticks and the Buffalo Trace on an ice ball is my favorite drink.  Staff is always smiles and hugs. Beautiful place. Beautiful people.

This is the best place in old town that nobody (at least not enough) know about.  I have never had a bad meal there and each time I try something new on the menu it is amazing.  They know what they are doing over here.  Great drink menu and selection.  They continue to do new creative stuff.  If you are tired of the same old stuff that every other place has this is your spot. It feels like home but better!

Great food and service.  I appreciate the fact that a bus boy accidentally took my almost finished drink and the manager saw it gave a new one.  Good people and the fact the stay on top of things is rare for old town.   Always a good time here.

The best tasting burgers around.  I love this place.  Enjoy a beer while you wait for your food.  Clean place.  Friendly staff.  Me and my son love the custard.  And the veggie burger was a surprise!  It was actually really full of flavor and filling.  The manager working Mike was really helpful and friendly.  Best place in AZ by far if you want a high quality burger and beer experience.

This place has lost the service it used to have.  I hope they can make a comeback because it used to be a good spot.  Today was the third time in a row service has been less than great.  I don't understand how in the service industry there is an lack of service but it makes you appreciate the few good spots with excellent service.  Go to this place at your own risk.

Best experience have had at a restaurant in a long time.  They really have hit a home run here and we got first class treatment here.  The food was amazing and the overall energy of this place makes you want to stay.  I'm a fan!! :)
