Let's make one thing clear, I LOVE barber shops. A good haircut is second to none. As the saying goes, "you're only as good as your last haircut." What's really nice about A&D Barber Shop is that your cut will be phenomenal, because Arthur takes his time with a cut. I've been plenty of barber shops that can give you your cut and sweep you out the door, but it isn't always to my standards. I get a super high and tight fade to skin with a very severe side part, and almost no length taken off the top. It's a more difficult cut than your normal taper and fade. And lots of barbers have botched it. Arthur tackles it no problem. We socialize the entire time and he couldn't be friendlier. There are complaints about wait time, but it's a barber shop. Wait time happens. And scheduling appointments at barber shops isn't like making a set-in-stone appointment at a salon.  Realistic expectations are your best bet, you can always call ahead to see what the wait is like! All in all, I get great haircuts from here and enjoy the time I'm getting them cut. Also, splurge and get the whole nine yards. A gentleman's delight.

So, maybe I don't get it. Maybe all the hype ruined it for me. Maybe it's gone over my head.   Only...I think I DO get it. This den of would-be Williamsburg-ites is beyond over-rated. Delux should spend less time spelling a word wrong, being lit like the interior of an alien craft, and begging for someone to confuse for them for a restaurant in the hippest part of Brooklyn...and spend more time on decent service, and food to match the lofty expectations set by your atmosphere. Which brings me to the point of all this:  the burger. The burger was, at best, okay. It didn't wow me, but it didn't repulse me either. The meat was tender and well-cooked but aside from that, I'm left wanting more...and honestly, I'm left wanting a lot more. I was led to believe that this burger would blow my socks off and that the fries would be so good, I would order another basket. The only good thing about your poorly seasoned, room temperature fries was the gimmick you delivered them to me in. You could literally hear my eyes rolling. I've had better burgers at plenty of restaurants that also weren't simultaneously clamoring for me to talk about "how cool they were". Our waiter was barely present;  I effectively only want to see you once in a while to refill my drink and maybe check in once the food is there...consider the ball dropped. I'd have more to say about this place and why I didn't like it, but I was too busy yawning at Delux's attempts at being "cool".  I do get it. You just haven't earned it yet, baby.

Great atmosphere. Really wonderful seating, I particularly love their booths. The price is very reasonable, and it's even great for a vegetarian to boot! Phoenix restaurants aren't always the best for my dietary choice, but we ordered the nachos here and they were more than willing to make them without meat for us. The last time I went, we went on an appetizer binge, sharing it amongst the table. We said we wanted dipping sauces and we got every house sauce they had. The waitress was incredibly attentive and the food was great. This quickly became a regular spot for me in Phoenix and will continue to be so. Do yourself a favor and go to the Vig Uptown. Get the Vigan Wrap and dip your fries in everything they have to offer!!!
