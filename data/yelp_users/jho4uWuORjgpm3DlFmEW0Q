I purchased a Asian salad along with loaf of bread the cashier was great.  My order was togo once I got home to eat the salad turns out that salad doesn't have any chicken.  Not a happy camper called and now my name is in guest book. I'm not sure I want to go back.

I order togo which was very fast on everything was correct.  Had a couple of drinks while I waited.  The N'awlins punch is awesome with fresh watermelon.  I found a new drink instead of the Swamp Thing.  Brook the bartender was GREAT... THANKS for a great experience when my second drink was not right.

Had an awesome time with our server name Sean. Sean had an awesome attitude, great personality, and very fun. Sean made sure we had everything we need at all times. The biscuits was on point as always. Right on time with the food.

Great service stop in for lunch. The build you own stir fry line was fully stocked witg all the meat, vegetables,  and sauces. I love having the gong rung when I put a tip in the glass for the cooks.

I want to thank Destiny for making sure my togo order was complete even with chicken on the Asian Salad. The salad and cheesecake was very delicious.  Thanks Arrowhead location for a job well done and clean atmosphere.
