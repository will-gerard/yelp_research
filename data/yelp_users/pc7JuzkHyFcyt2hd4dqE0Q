I have been to many.. many.. sprint stores and this is the worst. Employees are slow. Most of them very uneducated with their own product. And just all around poor customer service. This store needs some work.

Service is okay. Mac n cheese sucked, noodles were mushy and it was chalky. The Catfish was bland. The chicken and gravy was good, and the Kool aid in the jars was kinda cool and unique. Overall, disappointed.

Amazing pizza. Never had anything else on their menu-!but their specialty pizzas are very good! Delivery times aren't bad either, they always get here quicker than they said they would.

I only got an order to go but I liked the atmosphere and everyone was friendly. I got the Moroccan meatballs and they were horrible, but that could be just me. I've really liked other dishes I got there.

I had a reservation in which my insurance company was paying for. I talked to "John" on the phone and had everything set up and asked ahead of time if I could pay cash and I was told it was not a problem. I take a Taxi to their location (was in an accident) and "John" was the one I talked to and became the most difficult person to deal with that I've ever talked to. Wouldn't take cash and wouldn't allow me to use a card that was in someone else's name. They also wouldn't pick us up from 2 miles away because they were apparently too busy.. but when we got there they were anything but busy. I understand companies have policies but give me a break! He literally lied to our face and was a complete dick doing so.

I have loved jimmy john's for about 10 years now and consistently ordered from there in 3 different states that I've lived in. I work a couple blocks down and order from there about once a week. Average wait time is at least a half hour. They NEVER give me napkins. This is small.. but very annoying. To top it off their sandwiches just aren't what I'm used to from jimmy johns. The meat never tastes right. Anyways. I just ordered my last sub from there. It's a sad day
