If your visiting Scottsdale wanting to know where the locals go, this is the place!  Goldie's is that one place in town where everyone knows where it is and everyone has their favorite item (mines the Monaco Focaccia sub ranch)!    When you walk in it does definitely have the sports bar atmosphere with tons and tons of TVs with every game on that you could think of!  However, if your not a sports guy don't let that scare you away, it's a very welcoming place for anybody.    As I mentioned earlier, the foods awesome.  Everything is always tasty, even when I try something that sounds a little iffy, it's always great!  Service is what you would expect from a sports bar, the busier it is the slower it's going to be, but you should expect five star service here anyways.    If your visiting Scottsdale or live here and have never been, I urge you to give it a try!  Return factor- 100%

I signed up for the Ultimate Full Service Fast Pass and I am loving it so far.  I have only had one problem at this wash and Shawn resolved it very quickly.    The express wash is good, but it will leave water spots on your car as water gets stuck in the crevices that the towels don't get.  Once you start to drive, water dries on your car.  The full service is great, while there are times they forget to wipe down a window or two, you generally get a good result.  All in all, if you don't have much time for a full service wash, the express wash is a good wash, but don't expect the quality of a full service wash.  As long as Cobblestone keeps up the great customer service, they will always have me as a customer.

When I first walked in the first thing I noticed is this place is LOUD!  But, this is understandable when you see how large this store is!  I have been through the drive thu and inside and both are very efficient!  The product is exactly what you would expect at a Starbucks!   My few complaints would be there leather chairs.  They look nice, but other then that, they are cheap!  I understand they wouldn't what to put the fanciest chairs in there, but give us something better!    Also,  there sitting areas can get very messy!  It seems as if they can forget were there!  I wish they would do a walk-around every so often just to pick up people drinks and news paper and whatnot.

Dutch Bros is as good as it gets!  I'm a huge Starbucks fan so I won't say that this is better but its pretty darn good!  My favorite part about it is that this Dutch Bros is open 24 hours a day!  As a ASU student, having a 24 hour place to get some energy is absolutely awesome.    I have never had one drink here that was not great (although I often stick with my iced caramelizer).  The staff there is always very helpful and energetic and I love that, I find that it makes it a little bit easier to stay awake and keep on going after grabbing my order from these guys.  The line here is always super long but don't let that scare you away!  They are very quick and efficient with getting you your sweet caffeine.   Now, here is my one gripe and why it lost a star on my review.  The parking lot.  Absolutely horrible.  Once you drive in to this lot you have to commit to getting a drink as their is no way to back up or turn around to get out.    Return factor- 100%

I heard about Who's Next over a year ago and have been a loyal patron sense.  Alex, Arthur and Abram have all cut my hair and all do a pronominal job.  Very down to earth place with very down to earth people.  They know all the modern hair styles and do an amazing job at making you look great.  Best place in the valley by far.

The decision to try Tryst Cafe was not one of my own, however I am glad it was made.  They have a fairly small and simple menu, with very interesting choices.  For our starter we tried the summer rolls and beer battered green beans.  The summer rolls were good, but not nearly as amazing as the beer battered green beans!  They were absolutely amazing!  (and devoured by my whole family).  For my main entr√©e, I played it safe with the Beef Burger.  The burger was good, however they overcooked mine and that was a bit disappointing.  Though I played it safe, my whole family loved all of there choices!    You will see my return factor will be somewhat low, but only due to the limited menu options of my liking (again, I'm more of a bar food guy) I am however craving those green beans!  So you never know!   Return factor- 45%

I am always in this little shopping center and have been wanting to try Gigi's Cupcakes for a long time!  I finally had the time to stop in and get a cookies and cream cup cake.  Lets just say the best thing about this place is there branding!  I love the boxes and packaging they have!  I just wish there product was as good as the packaging!    When I opened my box, the first thing I was treated to was a lovely dark hair on the top of my frosting!  I then cut the top of the frosting off and carefully ate the rest of the frosting.  Honestly, store bought frosting is better then this stuff!  It is so DRY!  The actual cake part was not bad, but it wasn't anything I couldn't whip up in my own oven!    All in all, you paying a lot for an average joe cupcake (with a hair on it).

Tide Dry Cleaners is awesome on paper.  All of their amenities are super cool and almost make Dry Cleaning fun.  I have been a customer of this Dry Cleaner for as long as they have been open, and they used to be great.    More recently they have been been making me pretty upset and I had my final straw with them pretty recently.  They have probably ruined two shirts due to not following proper care instructions that are written on the tags of the garment.  The final straw that I had with them was one day I was picking up my clothes through their automated system outside and everything went as normal until I got to my house.  When I got to my house I started hanging up all my clothes and then I noticed that some of these didn't look familiar.  Well, that would because my order got mixed up with other peoples clothes.  I immediately took time out of my day to go back.  I gave them the clothes that weren't mine and then asked for the shirt that I was missing.  Her eyes lit up like I had just asked for a million bucks.  She then told me that I had to wait for a manager.  I hung out for about 30 min waiting for this guy to "finish his deliveries".  When he finally showed up he acted as if I had no idea what I was talking about and like its impossible to make a mistake.  He asked me what it looked like and told me that he would look around for the shirt and call me in a week.  Well, he never called me.  I had moved to Tempe during this time so I had not had any time to go back and track down my missing shirt.  One day about three months later I found my self back in the area.  I walked in and look at that there he was, I asked him if he remembered me and reminded him that he never called me as he said he would.  All of the sudden he remembered me and started making up excuses too why he hadn't called me.  He apologized and told me I could buy that shirt again online on the spot ($85 shirt) with his company card, or he would give me $100 account credit.  I took the credit.  I plan on going back only enough to redeem my credit and thats that.  It's not worth the headache of going to this place.  I would stay away.  Return factor- 0%

I have been wanting to check this place out for quite a while.  I finally had a chance to go and get a classic Smashburger.  When I first walked in I was presently surprised with the modern decor!  Large HDTV's for the menu, modern dining room.  I thought it was all great.  When I got my burger I was disappointed by how messy it was.    Also, the portion of fires you get are a bit disappointing.    Other then that, Smashburger is a great burger joint.

Wok Box.  Amazing.  As soon as you walk in you are happily greeted "Welcome to Wok Box!" by the energetic staff!  Then while I was looking at the menu deciding what to order I was greeted by the owner and his wife, they gave me a run down of the menu and I decided to go with the Sweet Mongolian.  After placing my order I watched it go through all the steps of making it, my favorite was watching the wok!  Man that guy was good!  I herd the other employees refer to him as the "Wok Master", I would certainly agree!    Once I got my order, I sat down and started to look around.  That's when I realized how amazing the decor is, beautiful wood design with a very large Asian mural on the wall.  Now, lets talk about the food.  Not much to say other then it was amazing!  The beef was extremely tender and the sauce was perfect.  It could not of been better.  All in all, Pei Wei will not be seeing much of me anymore!

Snooze is amazing and hands the the best breakfast place I've been to.  It's easy to say that many people agree with me as the wait can be a little long at times but always worth it.  They are strict about no reservations and they will not put your name on the list until they see you in front of them.  Once your name is down they will text you when your table is ready, it's usually between 15 minutes to an hour and they are always within the stated time.  The wait goes by quick as there are many stores around to kill time- including Scottsdale Quarter on the other side of Scottsdale Road.  Oh, and they even have free coffee for you while you wait for your table.  The food is always amazing, the menu changes depending on the time of the year.  I'm pretty loyal to the breakfast pot pie as that has never let me down.  The service is always great, staff is Dutch Bros like (peppy and eager to talk to you).  All in all, I love this place.  Highly recommend.  Return factor- 100%
