So I have been waiting for this doctor for an hour now... Still have yet to see him. I made this appointment using zocdoc. I was also told to arrive 15 minutes early-even though I filled out everything online. However they could not load it when I got to the appointment and I had to fill them out again.   Then came the long wait in the waiting room where I was tortured to watch a woman burp, barf, and change a poopy diaper. Not the offices fault but did not make the day any better.   Doctor was nice and staff is nice but I would have taken the wait a lot better if they just said - hey the Doctor is running late.

Didn't realize how terrible this place was until I went somewhere else. Reason I went somewhere else is because they told me that I couldn't do my wellness check and std screening together- when I always have in the past. They wanted me to schedule two separate visits where I would have to pay two separate co pays.... I went to a new doctor and not only did she do it all in one visit she also gave me my birth control on the spot with no charge and without going to the pharmacy, and I also found out that the Estrella clinic had given me false information. This place treats you like a cattle not a person. I would never recommend this place

I've been to lots of the Hawaiian BBQ places and this one is my favorite. Their food is always made fresh but also very quick. The staff is always friendly, it's always clean. If you are looking for a quiet dinner I would suggest ordering to go, this place is always crazy busy but I've never waited longer than ten minutes. My favorite is the katsu chicken with crab raggoons, served with teriyaki and they hide the siracha behind the counter :)

I've been to many tanning salons but I really enjoyed this experience. I normally only do the beds but my first time here I tried the spray tan. The girls talked me through everything and didn't pressure me to buy anything :) can't wait to go back! Great price, convenient location, good flow of customers but no wait time.

Paid for a full haircut and style and the Stylist just cut my dirty hair dry and didn't style it. I'm not one to argue so i just paid and left

I used to love this place but the service here is terrible! They do this "shared tables" where every server works every table so half the time you have no service and the other half you are constantly bothered. Amazing food but I had to stop going here after the second time I ended up walking out after 10-15 minutes of not even having my drink order taken when it wasn't even busy!!

I like this place. I don't love it- but it's not bad. Pretty good service I like that the chefs actually talk to you and the drink specials are pretty good. Not the highest quality sushi, but satisfying.

Wow. So I ordered to go and whoever answered the phone sounded like she was in the middle of a parade! I asked what soup they had and she says no we don't have any promotions. I told her no soup and she said hold on while I find another phone. She switched phones but I could still barely get my order through. I wouldn't have really minded much I've worked in the restaurant business but she had no customer service at all. This place is ghetto. Ghetto ghetto. You would think in a chain such as this there would be some kind of quality control and thorough training but I've been to this location on a couple occasions and the service has never improved. Ghetto. Oh. And to top it off, she told me 40 minutes wait for soup bread sticks and tiramisu... Wow.

The buffet is delicious! Hard to find Indian food such as this around phx. The service is a little funky but it's a store and a restaurant, I think if I were Indian I would have probably had better service

I've been going here for a long time and I was very disappointed today. The woman at the counter was VERY rude. When she gave me my receipt she practically slapped it down on the counter. She did not give us soup bowls and when the guests after us asked for them she acted like she didn't want to give them any either so I didn't even bother to ask. The woman obviously wasn't having a good day and was taking it out on her customers. Typically they give us sauce with our combos and we didn't get that either. The fries are normally very good but today they tasted like they had been sitting for a long while. Im thinking that they are trying to cut costs because even the salad and gyro was skimpy on the toppings, not like it used to be.

Used to love this place. Switched owners and now the service is terrible and they no longer carry duck. Really sad because I used to come here at least every other week with all my girlfriends. Very disappointed. Won't be eating here again.

Best food best service. Everything is always fresh and is super authentic. The owner is the nicest guy and is always in a great mood. I often add ingredients like sausage to some of his plates and he never complains about it. The salad dressing is amazing.

Best lunch buffet it town! Amazing flavors, always fresh and a clean, relaxing environment. If you've never had Indian this is the place to try, or if you know what you like you can't go wrong here!!

Love this place, felt absolutely amazing leaving here! Wish I had a bit more alone time with Mayo but over all it was terrific! I used a groupon but their prices are really affordable anyways

Will never pay for a service here again or recommend anyone. Received a Brazilian. Came home to find out I not only still had wax all over me but also a ton of hair left! Started to pluck the hairs but there were so many I ended up going to a different salon where they laughed with me about how terrible the service was. Everyone at the place was nice but I did not get a good wax. Don't waste you money here. I wouldn't even get a service here if it were free.

This is gourmet food. Made fresh with the best ingredients. Love their coffee and they have the best cupcakes I have ever had hands down! The strawberry one is my favorite.

Yum yum!! Great price for great food! The service is very friendly. The sandwiches are appropriate size, not for those with bottomless stomachs. The peppers are AMAZING. Wish I didn't have to drive so far to get them but they are worth the trip. Simple menu makes ordering easy and everything is delicious! Only thing making it miss 5 stars is that there's no x-factor.. Just missing that little extra oomph

This is by far the best place to get a home cooked meal away from home. All the food is freshly prepared with only the best ingredients. The wait is just a little longer than your average restaurant but good things are worth the wait! The staff is friendly and the prices can't be beat. Like the name says it's everybody's neighborhood grill!

I work at a salon down the street from here and this is one of our favorite places to order from. We do pho Friday's and it's the best day of the week. The girls and I love the vegetarian pho, pho special, shrimp and pork fresh spring rolls, Thai tea boba and Thai coffee boba. Service is fast and friendly and the restaurant it always nice and clean.

Delicious! But a little spendy. I've never dinned in i just order To-go. I recommend the moist brisket :)) also love the cream corn. If you like smoky bbq this is the place. If you don't- this is not your place

Saw mike I think his name is.. Or maybe mark.. Anyways. He did a great job :) not a lot of barbers can do a women's cut and keep it feminine but he did exactly what i asked.

It's like the chipotle of pizza. Delicious and cheap. Fresh ingredients good staff. Only for people who prefer their crust on the thinner side. I suggest pineapple with sausage :))

Absolutely love the owner here! She is the only one that I trust to do my nails. I am a hairdresser and I am very rough on my nails between coloring and my hands being in water all day. She is the only nail tech who is very thorough, clean, and her nails never break off or lift like the other nail techs I've been to. She just purchased this salon a few months ago and I am so glad she did!! She has a ton of fresh colors- not the old nasty ones like a lot of places and actually sanitizes her tools unlike most places and holds great conversation! I recommend this place to all my friends, family, and clients.

Absolutely love the owner here! She is the only one that I trust to do my nails and the only person I have gone to consecutively. However. I was unable to get in with her and I left the salon with acrylic all over my fingers and hands, and less than satisfactory nail polish job and shape. Not cool. Will never return
