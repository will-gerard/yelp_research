Finding treasures each time I shop here...from clothing to dinnerware to stopping to grab a unique bottle of wine. Huge selection of everything quirky for your home.  It allows you the opportunity to mix & match and decorate your home, affordably!   The jewelry is constantly updated with new and beautiful items, alot of them you will not find anywhere else, the east Indian flare is unique and again, affordable! You will not be disappointed!

Horrible...waiting in a drive thru for an ice cream treat shouldn't take 20 minutes. Horrible customer service too. Thank God it's fan food because it sure isn't fast-food!!!

Chicken wings under cooked, juice squirted out as you bit into it...pizza was card board cheese. The atmosphere, well on this particular evening another patron got sick at the bar, and instead of excusing herself and going to the restroom, she just sat there and let puke run down her chest...bar tenders or management didn't tell her to leave, I told her to get up and leave and she wouldn't. Her boyfriend continued to enjoy his fried basket of whatever he was eating while the rest of us got a whiff of what her stomach didn't agree with.   Will NOT be returning to this establishment!!!

Had lunch here yesterday, service wasn't impressive during lunch and they were out of quite a few things. I was expecting a more impressive egg roll given the name of the restaurant. Would not eat here again. Especially after seeing this place was listed on the Dirty Dining report for 4 health code violations the SAME day I consumed their food. Horrifying!! I ordered the Mongolian beef, wasn't any different than any other place I've ordered it from.

Delicious food and unique Margarita's beyond compare. Small dining room but big enough to host a small dinner party and still feel you have privacy. Very friendly employees who are willing to go the extra mile to ensure a return visit!   The art work displayed throughout the restaurant is also tasteful and you have the option to purchase. Seeing the local arts showcased makes you start to feel our city does have culture!

As expected, it was crowded with other Sunday morning patrons looking to have breakfast. We were seated at our table relatively quickly. Nothing fancy, small restaurant but the food was great and very filling. Large portions, I was only able to eat 1 of the 2 very large protein pancakes, they were delicious!

Can't beat the view! I also can't believe I've lived here all my life and didn't know this place existed. Very friendly service and really good drinks. I'll have to go back and taste the other food because I only had fish & chips and you can't go wrong with that.

I really wish that I had read these review BEFORE purchasing the groupon for the mani/pedi...Shame on you Groupon for not displaying HONEST reviews first of all.  It has been 6 days since visiting the salon with my daughter, which is who the Groupon was purchased for, a gift for her senior prom.  When first entering the salon, your met with a display case of jewelry and purses for sale...I thought we were in the wrong place.  The only two women in the shop greeted us nicely and showed us to the adjoining room where more hair salon chairs sat and then we saw the 2 pedicure chairs and 2 nail stations.  They asked us what services we wanted and we explained that we purchased the Groupon certificate.  I stated that my daughter had very short nails and we wanted to get the acrylic nails...they said it would be an additional $22.  Excuse me?  Ok, we didn't have much of a choice because I had already blown $25 on the certificate.  They told her to pick a color, she wanted yellow.  There was only ONE color yellow, and it was a sad mustard color looking yellow, nothing cheery or happy about having mustard colored nails.  Anyway, moving along into the appointment....the pedi was subpar compared to what I've seen other nail salons do...but all along, the ladies were talkative and nice.  TWO hours later, the nail part of the appointment was finally concluding...my daughter wanted a nail decal and she even had a photo of the design she had selected...they assured her that they could make the design, but then started offering 10 sheets of glue on decals that they thought would look better.  My daughter wanted a specific design and stated that from the beginning...they assured her that they could paint it on...IT LOOKED HORRIBLE!!!  We just looked at each other and were so tired of being there, that we just decided to cut our losses and get out.  That's not the end of it...prom was Saturday night, our appointment was the Wednesday prior to that....when putting on her shoes for prom, one of the nails chipped and broke.  POOR quality products were used.  It's now Tuesday and all of the nails have either chipped or fallen off completely.  HOW DOES THIS PLACE STAY IN BUSINESS?????  I want my money back, OR I want Groupon to remove their advertisement.  If these are the types of business Groupon decides to advocate for or publish, then I just won't use Groupon anymore either.  At least vet the businesses you decide to sponsor on your site Groupon.    Hugely disappointed with this purchase all the way around.

I have not attended an event like this before, nor have i experienced the taste of craft chocolate...let me just say WOW!!!! I attended the first anniversary party last night and cannot express how amazing the chocolate tastes. I can't imagine buying a Hershey's bar after experiencing how magical the craft chocolate tastes.   The owners were truly informative about the beginning and end process. It is hard work that takes time and dedication to create such wonderful tasting desserts. Thank you for hosting this event, I will be recommending this tour to all friends and family!
