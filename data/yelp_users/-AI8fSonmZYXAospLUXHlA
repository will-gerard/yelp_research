Just recently stayed at this hotel. The outside of this hotel is very charming. Just like everything else in AZ the building is brown. Staff was extremely sweet, breakfast is your standard Hilton breakfast with extras on the menu. The pool is big with a full bar. Very nice! Although it is sweltering in AZ I did try out the jacuzzi, very relaxing. The room we stayed in lacked natural light..no windows just French style doors to open (that you can actually go out of to access the pool area) the room felt to dark. There is also a sitting area outside of the French doors from your room, nice and quiet but I missed having a window!

Went here to get a pedi, really nice decor, staff was pleasant. The guy who did my pedi was really nice but water was not warm..(almost cold) and my guy watched the football game while massaging my feet the whole time(which made my feet and legs hurt) I don't know if it's standard but he massaged my feet and legs for about 30 mins..He was way to rough..pedicure came out nice though.. 2 stars

Small cute vegan place in what looks like a warehouse building. I ordered the beet brag burger and my husband got the avocado sandwich. I also ordered eggplant bacon. Everything was to perfection, I actually wished I got the avocado because was so good!! There's a lot of rosemary in it which made it even more delicious. The beet burger was on a toasted bun and the waitress brought out homemade ketchup they made that day, finger licking good! The eggplant bacon is eggplant that is roasted to a crisp..soooo gooood!!! Ask for their lemonade to, very nice. :))) can't go wrong here!
