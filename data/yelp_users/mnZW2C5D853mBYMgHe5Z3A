This place is unanimously beloved by my friends and I. If I ever have friends visiting from out of town, I always take them here for great drinks and delicious food. My go-to drink is Whisky Sour and my go-to food item is the Little Birdy- MUST TRY! Either the Litte Birdy, or the Big Jim if you are extra hungry.

Our chihuahua ripped open a bag of chocolate protein shake and we called Alta Vista. The lady was SO KIND and informative over the phone. We were able to bring him in with a stomach full of peroxide and fortunately he threw up all the powder.

After one call with Jocelyn, there was no way I was going here. She put me on hold and didn't put me all the way on hold because I could hear her and her coworker laughing and talking. After 5 minutes, the call was dropped. I called back and told her not to put me on hold and asked for eye exam availability.   Jocelyn: "the earliest I have available is in 3 days."  Me: "you don't have anything available today?" Jocelyn: "yes, there's availability for today at 2pm"  Why wouldn't she tell me that from the beginning? Fortunately, I called around and had a much better experience at their neighbor Walmart Vision Center.

Friendly service from all areas- bussers, hostess and waitress were all friendly and attentive! The pizza is delicious, but be sure to save room for a nutella banana crepe.

I had a tire blow out on the i10. I pulled off and stopped at the nearest QT. A tire specialist came out quickly (even after I mistakenly gave him wrong directions). He was quick, friendly and knowledgable and even added air to all my other tires!

Loud R&B music in the front competing with the loud rap music in the back I guess for the dishwasher. I even asked the barista to turn down the music. It's impossible to study here!

Super quick, super expensive, and not good at all- almost a sad At-home attempt to create your own chipotle burrito. Salsas in little cups tasted weird. Save your money!!

The first free basket of chips was a great way to sample their salsa bar. Portions were huge! I loved their rice with a few corn kernels .

Great Men's cut! I was also surprised by the massages.

Can't beat a large 1-topping pizza and a dozen wings for $15... The pizza was pretty good and the wings were great. I think I just prefer pizza less fluffy and with more cheese. Other than that, the 15 minute wait was quick and the price was cheap. Definitely a nice change from Dominos or Pizza Hut.

Always can count on delicious food even when I try something new on the menu. My favorites are the chorizo burrito, shrimp taco, vegetables and margaritas! The margaritas are tasty and strong so don't plan on having more than two.   Service is excellent. I'm a huge fan of the server Ashley- charisma for days!

Update: No fault- my friend went home on his own. The security guard was actually friendly and patient while explaining the surprising new law. In the end, it was a great night!   ***NO ENTRY w/ VERTICAL ID***  Group 15 were denied at entrance (with 2 tables reserved for bottle service). Security claimed there was a "new law in effect as of 7/24/14  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

Not very quick, but they sell a decent sized box of fried rice for $3! Great for staying on a travel budget if your willing to sacrifice the meat!

There were sharpies hanging out in their meat. Yes, they saw it sitting there but never took it out...

I'm experimenting with longer hair on the top and a clean look on the side. Albert listened to all of my requests and my cut came out PERFECT! It's hard to find someone that can take all your requests and in the first cut make them all happen.   I was a little worried about paying for the parking meters, but Frank, the owner, ran out and filled the meter for me.   Also, the interior design is fantastic! Very clean and sleek, gentlemen.

My Maltese, Ace, LOVED the two guys. Of course, he was a bit nervous at first. But by the end, he was happily running back and forth between me and the groomer. Beyond Ace's satisfaction, I could tell the groomer was super talented. Ace's fur almost reminded me of a plush, stuffed animal- super soft and fluffy!
