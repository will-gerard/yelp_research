By far my favorite place to frequent. I'm constantly bringing friends and family to this spot because I can always count on the for fantastic food and wonderful service all in an enjoyable and comfortable atmosphere.  There can't be more than 5 ladies on their waitstaff who are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about all the wines in house. Some nights they have live music on the back patio which is an added bonus to the great weather we have (almost) all year round.  If you stop in, make sure to try their meatballs... they are simply AMAZING!! Everything else is delicious too, but the meatballs are most definitely one of a kind and I love me some meatballs.  Shout out to Wine Cellar, you ladies are the best!!

As hard as it can be to find a quality Italian restaurant  here in the valley, I can always count on Marcello's for fantastic food and service.   We recently inquired with them to cater our engagement party for about 50 guests.  The staff was extremely friendly and professional and worked with us to customize a menu tailored to our wants and needs at a very reasonable price. The food was absolutely amazing and guests were asking all night where it was from. Tony and his crew fully set up and broke down the buffet and I was always able to get ahold of them when I reached out or had a question.    Flexibility, timeliness and delicious food is my idea of a 5 star catering establishment. With stellar customer service to boot, you really can't beat this place for your next event or holiday party. Don't believe me, stop by for dinner. I gaurentee you won't be disappointed with whatever you decide to order.

What a wonderful staff!! A friend and I stopped by for dinner the other night just minutes before they were about to lock the doors. Realizing how late it actually was, we apologized and started to head back to the car. They insisted on having us stay and were so incredibly welcoming. The food was good, but it was the service and friendly staff that will have me making another visit sometime in the near future.  Next time of course, not so late.

How is this the first time I've tried this place in the 10+ years that I have lived in Ahwatukee? SO GOOD!! Best breakfast burrito I have ever had, by a long shot. Their green salsa is pretty amazing too. The lady up front was so cute and witty and definitely made the experience complete.  Can't wait to come back again :)

If you need a server.... you can find just about all of them sitting at the bar playing around on their phones.   We had the pleasure of having Sierra as our server- whose attitude was just about as piss poor as her service. I ordered a tostada/taco lunch special, so you can imagine my surprise  when a taco and some other slop was placed in front of me. Sierra advised me the mystery item was in fact an enchilada. Ah... it's Mexican food right? Just the same shit put together  slightly different. I told her not to worry, I'd eat it anyway.  I wouldn't have mind as much... but then she proceeded to argue with me that I was wrong because when she took my order she asked me for red or green sauce. "Enchiladas are the only item that come with sauce".    Not enough energy to argue with her, she immediately made her way back to the barstool where her phone was again glued to her hand. After about 15 minutes  of having dirty plates just sitting in front  of us, I thought I would do her a favor, head up to the bar with my card and pay. No use in staying  there any longer nor ever coming back. For better food and service I'll visit the Filibertos drive thru across the street.

Friendly service and delicious coffee. I'm addicted to their Totti, best iced coffee west of the i10.   Love that we have a place like this in the neighborhood.  Everyone who works there is super nice and easy to talk to. The definition of a hidden gem but I think people are starting to catch on. Maybe I'm not the only Totti addict!

Recently visited this location for a simple phone upgrade. Let's see, where should  I start...  1. From doing my research before the in store visit, I was pretty sure which phone I wanted. After telling the representative who 'assisted' us what I was looking for he insisted that I buy the phone at Best Buy because they were giving away free TV'S with purchase.  I didn't want a tv, nor was that the purpose of my visit. I needed a phone and as a consumer, I chose to give my business to YOU (Verizon) as I thought that was the obvious choice. I appreciate the heads up on the deals their competitors were offering, but please just sell me a phone...  2. The phone I wanted wasn't available.  The sales rep didn't offer to check the availability at some of their other stores but AGAIN suggested that I go to Best Buy...  I settled for another phone which was ALSO 'not available' currently in house.  He told me however that he could order it and it would be shipped to my house in 2 business days and that I could come back and have them set uo the new phone and switch over all my info.  3. 10 days later... my phone arrives. I head back to the store to trade in my old phone and get my new one set up. After waiting for 40 minutes for a representative to be assigned to me... the rep (at the same store) tells me that not only can she not transfer my data (which I have had done previously at this location) but that I was not an authorized user on the account ( which would have been good to know when we bought the phone our first visit. The rep during this visit didn't offer any solutions just told me she couldn't help me an let me walk out the front door.  We call into Verizon and my husband has me added as an authorized user in just seconds. They set up my new phone over the phone and advise that all my data CAN be transferred on the cloud. They apologized for the poor service during my in store visit and referred us to the GO Wireless retailer a mile away.  The GO Wireless retailer not only switched over all my data (which somehow this Verizon store couldn't do) but they gave me a tutorial on my new phone and helped me find some accessories to go with. They told me that even if they didn't have the accessories in house, they work with other stores in the valley to get their customers what it is they want.   In summary:  You are a phone store... please do yourself a favor and keep retail in house. I understand I could have purchased the phone off their website,  but I went to the store and waited in your lines to get the full customer experience and I can confirm that it was AWFUL. Don't be surprised when your joke of a store closes its doors and you lose your jobs to online retailers.  And a lesson to your sales reps...   Understand your products,  know AHEAD of time what kind of inventory you have in house, and if a customer comes in looking to spend money,  do yourself a favor an make a sale.  IT'S YOUR JOB! I appreciate the heads up about Best Buy but please just sell me a phone!  Lastly, I'm not sure if I chalk this experience up to the lack of product/service knowledge on behalf of your employees or complete laziness but all I can say is... YOU CAN DO BETTER....

Great atmosphere and amazing service.  S/O to TJ who was our friendly and personable waiter who was more than knowledgeable on the menu and able to make some suggestions.    The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I have yet to explore any of their food selections.  I'll be back though. It's nice to have a place like this so close to home.

Love this place!!  Even in the middle of the hot Arizona summer I was able to enjoy a few cold ones on the rooftop deck. Great variety of draft beers with delicious food and friendly service.  I believe that this place is still a hidden gem in the middle of downtown Chandler. Ones it cools down a bit, suggest you check this place out. You won't be disappointed!

Every neighborhood needs a deli like this. Mine doesn't have one but I gladly make the drive because this spot is definitely worth it.   A great selection of cold cuts, freshly baked breads and a simple yet delicious variety of authentic Italian staples to choose from on the menu. Make sure to save some room for a cannoli or some of Carlo's famous tiramisu.  Large portions made in house with quality ingredients and reasonably priced. One of my favorites is the Beef Braciola but you can never go wrong with the meatballs either...  Carlo and his crew are amazing. A great place to keep in mind for catering small parties or corporate luncheons.

So excited to have this little gem in our neighborhood. Last night, my husband and I rode our bikes over to check this place out for the first time.  We tired a few things off the menu and it was all fantastic. The snow crab in lemon... YUM! The shrimp paired with sausage and potatoes in the trifecta sauce YUM! We were even blown away by the ribs and their mac and cheese! No date night is complete without a cocktail and they have a whole list of delicious concoctions.   Miesha took care of us and this lady is the DEFINITION   of a great server! As first timers,  she explained the menu to us thoroughly, made a few suggestions and checked on us periodically to make sure we were OK. Her service alone gets 5 stars!  I can't wait until it starts to warm up a bit and we can enjoy some time on their patio.  The only thing I can suggest  (and maybe we couldn't find it) is if you could please add a bike rack.
