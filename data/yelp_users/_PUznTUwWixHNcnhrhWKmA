Went in for dinner before the comedy show. Our sushi order was a bit slow but the manager was extremely accommodating to compensate for the delay. I was extremely impressed with the customer service, it made me want to go back. Plus the sushi rolls were delicious!

I did not stay, I was extremely disappointed to find out you had to be over 21 to sit on the patio at 6pm. I had my 12 year old with me and it was a beautiful night and the inside atmosphere couldn't compare to being outside. I've never heard of such a policy and couldn't justify staying.
