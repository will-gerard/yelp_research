Boo tom's. You signed up for wine walk, took al the promo that went with it, then decided to close because you ran out of wine and food? Really sets a bad example for Phx events. Disappointed and won't be back.

Very disappointed with our purchase and the service we received afterwards. Beautiful and unique selection of modern lighting in their catalogs, there were great options. We bought two pendant lights at roughly $250+ each.  Less than two years later and we've had to replace both lights due to faulty wiring/ bad connection. The first time we took the light in and they lost our fixture and took no record of receiving it. They were slow to get back to us so we went into the store. It ended up taking 5-6 weeks to replace, and hey waived the cost of the replacement unit. Same issue came up with our second light 4-5 weeks ago and they ordered the replacement by phone. We still haven't heard back, no updates or eta on our light. Frustrating  and disappointing to have the centerpiece of our kitchen be such a disappointment for so long. We thought the higher price would be justified with quality of product and service. I'm very disappointed Hinkley doesn't stand behind either.

Best ribs you'll ever have in your life. We started a tradition of takeout on Friday and couldn't be happier. The usual suspects: Ribs and fries and the ice cream sundae. Also highly recommend the grilled artichokes and spinach dip.. We tend to stick with takeout these days - guess I'm looking for more of a relaxed atmosphere, less formal and more energetic when dining out. I'm not thrilled with the wine list but who needs it after all that food. And it is consistently amazing food.

Very disappointing all the way around. This place lost its soul sometime between my last visit 15 years ago and sept 2015. They had zero people in the audience, except other acts for the night. Audience is part of the lure of live music, can't imagine how performance feels in an almost empty room.. So so much potential but poorly done. Either start trying or Call me if you ever decide to sell.

I LOVE LUCY! Let me count the ways: 1-Bargains. Lucy moves inventory and can always be counted on to have quality selections on sale. 2-Fit. Lucy loves me know matter what my size - just saying there is more of me to love these days and she does not judge. Thrilled I can find comfortable, cute clothes to look and feel good in when I'm active. As a short, fuller figured girl I can get behind the "short" sizes that allow me to step out of the fitting room and onto the trail. 3-Service: Lucy girls are ON IT, always so service minded and checking for size and got while I'm in the dressing room. Never let me carry things for too long without asking if they Can start a room for me. And just plain nice. And lastly, 4- wear. These clothes are comfortable and durable and I own my pieces for many many years after purchase. Will keep an eye out for one Yelpers feedback on declining quality but I just haven't seen it.   Only complaint is that, despite my commitment to scouring the sale racks, I always manage to find the full price item that puts my tab over the top. No doubt Lucy does that on purpose, for which I forgive you. Go you, Lucy!

Yelp needs to change their rating system so we can give cafe monarch the credit it is due. Six stars for atmosphere, food, wine list, service, and did I mention atmosphere! My hubby and I don't dine out like this all the time so it was a special treat to indulge and add all the extras as well (extra course and wine pairings were well worth it). This place is special, a one of a kind experience and my new favorite in Phoenix.

Solid place, I was impressed. Had a large group and did takeout smorgasbord of several entree items: chicken dishes: spicy chicken, Kung pao, teriyaki, and orange. Shrimp lo mein and broccoli beef. Fried rice was outstanding, and what can I say about white rice? Egg rolls got rave reviews, as did the crab puffs. I've never seen a better organized takeout. EVER. And to top it all off I loved my fortune!  I will insist we go back when we are in the neighborhood. Thanks fellow Yelpers for helping us find this gem!

Best contractor we've ever worked with. Why? Thorough, knowledgeable, flexible, and patient in helping us choose the right product. I never felt rushed. Excellent at setting expectations, then exceeding them. And by far the cleanest and most professional install experience we've ever had. Big box guys might have started out a little lower on price, butI have no doubt  the product and service we received were superior. And based on the few surprises our 1970s home threw at us, no doubt we would have spent more in the end. Cody and Chris were great problem solvers and owned every step of the process. I was impressed right til the end when they wouldn't bill us until the hfollow up items were completed and the last bit of caulk went down. Truly impressive and much appreciated - we will definitely be back!

We are home Toddy-ers and swear by the STAG roast after having it here one day. Now we're hooked.Toddy is much smoother, with much less acidity so you can enjoy more of the good stuff. We drive out of our way to get here and highly recommend to others. Nice, bright atmosphere and perfect for meetings or social. Pastry case looks good too but proud to say I haven't tried yet. Good beans. Good atmosphere. Good find.

Solid four  stars for the drinks and atmosphere. A little bummed that they didn't live up to their offer on urban wine walk event . Actually, really bummed bit I'm about to give up on the walk and have a strawberry shortcake cocktail... Maybe that'll make it better. We do love the Duce!

Vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting. Moist, good, not too sweet. Stock was low on a Sunday 10 minutes before closing but service was awesome. Will be back!

Viva Los Taquitos! Go to Los Taq for what they are - a walk-up restaurant with fun atmosphere, limited service and amazing food. Our favorites to grab and go: Chicken or Carne Asada burritos. Eating in: LOVE me some chicken tostada - the best I've had! Carne Torta is to die for either way, as is their Pico de Gallo! I've used Los Taq to cater too (pick up) and was thrilled with the experience. A note for those who are looking for the "Cheers" environment: My husband and i are there anywhere from 2-5 times per week. If the ladies at the counter don't know us, we simply take an interest in getting to know them! Nothing will come between me and my tostada!

Luncha Libre catered an event we attended last week. We had an exciting combo of tacos - from Thai Style, Steak/Gorgonzola to Bacon shrimp. All were amazing - we couldn't agree on a group favorite because they were all so unique and so darned good. Friendly staff, great food, and worth tracking down. Am looking for an excuse to have them cater an event at our place next!

Great atmosphere, affordable rates and great food. We had beans, guac, chips and salsa, pineapple and mango margarita and almost one of everything on the menu in our large group. LOVE that you do happy hour on Saturday- made our dinner for ten so reasonable!  Have to say a highlight of the experience was the very nice, blond server, Belinda? You made us feel at home - didn't feel like the typical counter experience and the family had a lot of fun with your help. Thanks for a fun start to our night!    Note: Map in Yelp is way off so use another app to get here.

Enjoyed dinner on the patio and happy to report it lived up to all the reviews. We shared the mac 'n cheese and the burger plus a bottle of wine from their extensive wine list (solid). Only glitch was that our waiter had several tables sat one time on the patio.. (Shouldn't be a surprise - this is why we live here...). Though it took some time to get to us, he was fun, knowledgeable and passionate about the place and I can't complain. Atmosphere, service and food all excellent.

I would give three stars for service and consistency; but bumped it to four because the beer and food are so darn good. If you come, bring your patience and a good attitude. You never know if you'll have to battle a crowd competing for wait staff - or if you'll be blown away by a super knowledgeable, attentive server. Either way, get over it because the atmosphere is awesome - a relaxing, indoor/outdoor, beer lovers haven. As to food, leave judgment at the door and give the spam sliders a chance. I know: Those who grew up on spam are no more anxious to relive childhood trauma. And those who've managed to avoid this long would wonder why start now. Just do it. At least once. It's a novelty done well and a fun food adventure. We also love the flatbreads and TV Tray Tuesday dinners. A great character place to hang out with friends.

We shopped several roofers before choosing Stell. Rates being competitive, the decision came down to service, quality of the product and a certain trust factor Mike established right from the start.  He is a small business owner genuinely invested in each customer and employee connected to his company. He thrives on exceeding customer expectations and takes personal pride in his team's accomplishments.   The Stell team was consistently excellent throughout every step of the process. We saw these guys at their best despite a busy storm season of Fall 2014 - what you see in the beginning is carried through until the job is done. Early on, Mike stood out in presenting his bid. His attention to detail and pride of ownership were clear - no other estimators talked about the importance of straight lines, coordinating paint colors and critical seams. This stuff genuinely excited Mike and showed us that he was invested in our job. He even made a few repairs at no cost, to tide us over until the new roof was on.    Our tear-off date was postponed by several days due to rains, but Mike was there to monitor and communicate before we could ask. (Tough to do with this Type A!) Once on site Junior and the roofing team were amazing. Mike has instilled ownership and integrity in each of the guys he employs.  They work long, hard hours to get in and out of each job as quickly but carefully as they can. They were respectful, diligent and really particular about their work. And they leave each day as clean - if not cleaner - than when they arrive. I'm only sorry I can't recall each name to properly thank them.   After the job Mike asked for genuine feedback on ways to improve our experience. Here's where we disappointed them - I can't think of a way and that is RARE.  We have been renovating our home for the last five months and worked with many contractors in the process. I put Stell at the top of the list. StellAR Roofing may be more appropriate!   Last but not least, a note on product: Take time to review the product your roofers are bidding - there is a difference. Before Stell, we almost went with a company providing an inferior product at a higher price point.  Mike's recommendation of Owens Corning was backed by popular review sites and turned out beautifully.

Five star bagel experience. Kettle-boiled and baked leave them crisp on the outside and soft inside. Been here several times and never had anything less. Cream cheese are amazing as well.  LOVE the everything bagel with Lox, Capers and Red Onion. Also had a great bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a jalapeño cheese bagel. Both outstanding and hubby and I mused at the price: $8 breakfast for two, unheard of in Phx. Seriously the best bagel this NYer has had in Phoenix.

Matt my friend,you never disappoint!   I chose to meet here for a business breakfast and was very happy with my choice. The goal: local, character, solid meal, easy parking  and central location. Mission accomplished.   Had the daily special with home fries - my MO is to trust the daily special and I'm always happy. Always love the coffee - though I would love to see some fresh cream from a local farm as an option.

You will NEVER be disappointed here. If you are, you are not human. This is our neighborhood go-to on a clutch- and we clutch at least once a week... Seriously best Z around - atmosphere is amazing with open air bar , lots of light and such an upbeat atmosphere! (Guitar playing in the background is AWESOME BTW. You have to pay attention to him-  he is playing much more than guitar, holy cow!!) we love, and I mean LOVE shrimp tostada bites, cornbread, pot stickers, ahi tuna and of course our waitress NICOLE!!! (Best ever. For real - and it's not the chambord  marg talking!) PS- gotta try at least one chambord marg, our only drink of choice here!

Ingo's is  home away from home. Cookies on the counter and you don't have to ask before you take one.. Or two. Good food that you come to think of as your own special something. Great vibe an the patio -even in July- without all the hassle. I heart into.  Must haves: chicken Sammie. Yes, it's that good. Chips are tdf (to die for). Veggie tray that comes with hummus could double as a centerpiece (if you're into that sort of thing). Greyhound with him though? Nah, had mine with vodka and enjoyed every bit of it. Love it, Will be a regular spot for us!

For all fellow Mac n cheese enthusiasts: This could be the best Mac n cheese in town! Had the Mac n cheese and a glass of Malbec (Pascual) for lunch. I'm a fan of the menu and the awesome choices for an airport option. Food is well done, atmosphere is great - though the Kierland site is far superior, this is a great option for the airport if you have time.   Had an hour to kill before our flight and they used every bit of it. Would only caution that you check before sitting down to make sure they can turn a quick meal.

LOVE IT: Pad Thai was uniquely done with brothy deliciousness. This alone will bring me back.  Chicken lollipops were fantastic - couldn't get enough of the sauce! Our server was great - knowledgable and pretty attentive. Atmosphere was fun a gorgeous bar and three projector screens playing football (when we arrived...foreshadowing...).   LIKE IT: The Crispy Garlic shrimp and papaya salad were great. Recommend you brave it and eat the entire shell as recommended. (We compromised and ate the shell but left the heads.)   LEAVE IT: For some reason we switched from playing Sunday night football to an episode of anime... Creepy, but I couldn't stop watching. Days later and i'm still trying to figure out what happened... Not enough to keep me away though, I'll be back for more Pad Thai and some of the pho on the menu we didn't get to try.   All in all gerat experience and would recommend to people i like.

I have a new best friend in A Bakedhop.This place is ridiculously good - wow!  Our favorites: Oatmeal Cream Pie, Peanut Butter and Ricotta Cookies are TDF. Life changing. I also loved the Italian white layered cakey-thing with light, whipped icing, though my hubby was so-so. Quaint inside, limited seating but perfect to take home. And a side note in response to another review here: 1) didn't know the register sign asked for Yelp reviews. What register? All I saw was the dessert case. 2) Parking does stink. Use the lot across the street and walk across - you're going to need the extra steps after this anyhow.

Apparently chicken can be served with any breakfast food! FIVE STARS for the cold brew iced coffee, which is reason alone to get here. Seriously the best and they top it with heavy cream which hardly oozes out of the dispenser!! The donuts rival portland's voodoo donuts, and don't shy away from the plain old fashioned served with your chicken. Fun, local, innovative and something different. Get here! You won't be disappointed!!

French fries at Humble Pie? OH YES! Stopped for a quick snack and Bloody Mary before a flight- so pleasantly surprised by both. Quick, personal and friendly service. TDF shoestring fries. I love the Phx airport dining options!!

Love atmosphere, was excited to go for my first time  for wine walk '15. Say, long slow lines to get in, then no food as promised . Will give them benefit of the doubt and try again but quite the buzz kill for our first stop of the day and first time here. :( try harder next time please because I think I could love you.

Update July 2015: came for lunch on a Monday. Still love the vibe here but wonder why nobody else seems to know it. Somewhat slow - good for us but I'm not selfish. Had the pork patty from burger joint and some fries. Excellent on both charges. Great, lively atmosphere and so fun to grab a latte to take back to the grind! We will be back for salad or sushi/bento box or maybe even happy hour. PS- who are you people who belly up to the bar on the middle of a Monday afternoon? I want to be you next time. Well done DeSoto.  PPS- check out the community room you can rent upstairs- love it!

All around amazing. GREAT SERVER, amazing mixologist at the bar happy to craft a custom concoction. I love the different approach and appreciate the fresh option in our neighborhood. Not a huge fan of southern food but this warrants a try when you're up for something different.   Ignore the little voice on your shoulder steering you away from the fried skins. It's a must try. The mussels are delightful as well. As for entree, the beef and potato dish was excellent and the hammock a unique, smokey experience. But let's get to what we loved best: THE BISCUIT DONUT DESSERT IS TO DIE FOR AMAZING. Tune out the voice that tells you to share dessert because trust me friend, you will want this one all to yourself. Do it! Don't share. Indulge. And work it off tomorrow once the sugar coma wears off...

Five star service, atmosphere and food. Should you need more than my word, a few examples to support. 1- Owners are awesome - personally invested in each dish and such genuine, authentic people you want to succeed in this place! 2-Food. We absolutely love most any daily special, but have a few regular go-tones on the menu as well: the pumpkin porridge =amazing. The Arepas= delish. Salsas that accompany this dish are solid. 3-Atmosphere-comfortable, simple and welcoming environment, feels like you're visiting a neighbor and friend when you come.   Get there. Now!
