Everytime I'm in the Phoenix area I make a stop at Cheba Hut. The place is completely marijuana themed and their sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Can't say enough good things about this place. Love it!

Stayed here for 3 days. For $40 I don't know if you can do much better.   The room was clean and the beds were made when we arrived in the room.   The service was pretty bad. We had to go downstairs for towels or anything, they would not bring anything up to us.   There was no cold water. While I understand it was 115F outside.. shouldn't they have plumbing that compensates for that?   Other than that it was a decent place to sleep.

I had the salmon + asparagus risotto and the bourbon shake.   The lady had the chicken wrap with fruit salad.   The server was friendly and the decor of the restaurant was beautiful.   It took a little bit of time to get our food but we were enjoying what was playing on the 2 TVs behind the bar.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  It looked like a small amount of food when they brought it but we were stuffed and could not finish our meals. The food was moderately inexpensive for such a nice restaurant as well.
