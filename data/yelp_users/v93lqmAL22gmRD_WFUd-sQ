Place was clean. Waiter was nice and kept on checking with us to se if we needed anything.  I had the french toast combo (2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, hash browns and ur choice of french toast) and a coffee. My Brat had the Denver burger (cheeseburger with ham and green bell pepper and onions omelette) with fries and a hot chocolate.  Food came to us in a decent time and place was busy.  Everything was delicious!! Even my daughter's burger was very good. And let me tell u I'm not a big fan of burgers at places like this.  An overall we were very satisfied with our meals and service and all for $26+tip

Will never come here again!!! We went there for breakfast a Saturday morning. They took forever to take our order, bring us drink and to bring our order. Waitress didn't know menu, she look so lost!!! when our order came back my eggs were cold and my house potatoes burned!!! Bad experience overall. I give them one star because I can't post without it :/

This place has the BEST Tacos Al Pastor in town. Had been coming to this place since 1990 when my family and I first moved to Phoenix. Since then I'd been trying other places but nothing compares to this place's tacos Al Pastor. Another one of my fave are the tacos de tripa and lengua. I hadn't have menudo here for a few years because I live far from this place but if menudo still tastes as I remember them it's so worth for you to try it if your some where near by early on the weekends.

I love their ph√¥!!! Their broth is very flavorful and they are very generous with the meats and noodles.  Place need a bit more of attention but it could also be that we were their a bit late on the day. Best of all prices are super low!!  Like other reviewers said, "it's a whole in the wall" kind of place. But definitely worth to try!!!

Since I'd been hearing many good comments about this place we decided to give it a try. Let me tell you, we don't regret it at all!!  Place is clean (even bathrooms), servers and cooks are very helpful and friendly.  We had the Flautas Ahogadas (rolled tacos drown in tomato sauce), Twin Burritos(red and green shredded beef) and a Chilindrina. All of the food was so good!!  We also had Mango and Horchata Aguas Frescas and they were the bomb!!  Can't wait to come back for some dessert since we end up with no space for it after our dinner. Restaurant didn't get 5 stars because is a bit over crowded, sitting area by kitchen was very hot and is not as big as it needs for all the clients they get. I think next time we'll take order to go. And I say next time because we're definitely coming back!! Overall was a good experience. I would recommend you try this place at least once. But I can assure you'll be back!!!

Was there for brunch today and my overall experience was good!! I ordered red menudo and it was delicious!!  My daughter order a breakfast burrito (eggs, bacon, potatoes and cheese) which was huge and good (so she said). My wife ordered Green Sour cream enchiladas which come with rice and beans. Wife liked her food as well. I tried her meal and I liked rice and beans, but the enchiladas not so much.  Loved the ice tea. It tasted fresh and best of all was not cloudy like it usually is in many restaurants.  I would definitely come back and try something else from their menu.

I keep hearing great comments about this place and since I love TORTAS  decided to give it a try. Walk in place thinking will be a fast way to take dinner home but oh boy I was wrong!!!!. I waited there for like 20 minutes by cashier to place my order and a waiter came and went but never even asked me if I needed help. So I decided to leave. The most disappointment part was that place wasn't even full. In fact only one table with a couple was occupied. I'd never went back and do not intent to do so. I'm giving it one star because I didn't try food and it doesn't let me post review without it. :/

Horrible, horrible service!!!  Paid $25 for a $13 car wash.  My windows are dirty inside out. Didn't even fully wiped the inside of the car.  There are crumbs everywhere.  If I new I had to come home and clean the car my self. I would just had done the express wash for $6 instead.   The reason why they got 2 stars is because staff seem friendly.

Ok. I had heard and read many good reviews about this place.  To be honest I have my favorite taco place already and it has been my favorite for years!!! But I don't get to go that way too often because is close to central Phoenix and I live farther west. So for that reason and because I was near by this place my mom and I decided to give it a try. Well let me tell u...this place didn't disappoint me at all. Best of all my mom (who by the way is super picky when it comes to Mexican food) loved it!!! We had tacos al pastor and tripas. Both were bomb!! I also order a small caramelo (cheese and carne asada flour quesadilla). It was good but for my taste, carne asada was a bit salty.  They have a salsa bar with different kind of salsas, pickled carrots, cabbage, onions and limes. I tried the red and toasted chile sauces. Both lack flavor and heat. I usually love the pickled carrots but this ones had no flavor. They didn't even tasted like carrots. We also order a carne asada and bean burrito to go for my wife. Well she didn't like it so much but because they were very skimpy with the beans. She liked the carne tho.  We were definitely be back. Tripas tacos are my fave and this place has the best tripas in town!! I just hope the add more flavor to their salsas and their pickled carrots.  Try the JAMAICA agua fresca. Is to die for!!!

This is my first time ordering and having my food delivered by this place.  Let's start with who answered my phone call; she was nice, friendly and answered all my questions.  We placed order from menu I got on link here in Yelp. We ordered pork fried rice, orange beef and crab wontons.  They said food was going to be delivered with a 30-45 minutes. It took them about 20 minutes to delivered by this super nice lady (who my dog almost killed of a heart attack; sorry). Which it was good cause we were starving.  Fried rice had an awesome flavor and so did the orange beef. Wontons were good but a little skimpy on cream cheese filling. Oder came with free egg rolls (which were also good), soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, spicy oil and fortune cookies.  In over all we were very pleased with our order and will definitely order again from them.

I wanted to give this place a try do to good reviews. But to be honest I was not impressed at all.  Food portions were good.  Not ur average Mexican huge meal portions. But enough to fill u up.  Tamales were small and not very flavorful. I order a corn quesadilla and masa was raw. I ended up opening the quesadilla and eating just the cheese.  I also order some tacos al pastor and they were ok.  I believe Mexican food should have a bold taste to it and what we order lack that.   Only good thing I have to say is place was clean and service was good. But I'm not sure if I'll be back.

I love, love their food; when they make it right. Which unfortunately is very rare!!! My favorite for breakfast is the multigrain bagel with cream cheese.  Well three times in a row they had taken more than 15 minutes to give it to me. Not only that but a couple of those times my bagel was cold.  Same thing has happened to my wife more than a couple of times. In fact she was there this morning and asked for a breakfast sandwich at drive thru and instead she got a chicken sandwich.  When she went back to let them know of their mistake a lady asked her twice if she was sure she got the wrong order.  My wife answered yes both times and ask the lady for a refund since she was being rude about it. The lady said they would fix it. So they did and when lady came back with correct order she told my wife in a ride way to check it so she wouldn't walk out with the wrong order again.  My wife never received an apology for it.   It really sucks not to be able to get a good meal at this place.  All of us at home love their food.  It's a shame the staff is not properly trained or they just don't care of providing good customer service.

We started our dinner with an amazing Ceasar Salad. It was super fresh ,had cashews instead of croutons and fresh sliced tomatoes. Definitely the best I had ever have. Sliced warmed bread comes with a delicious creamy roasted bell pepper dip.  I had the Polos Pasta, which was very good.  My wifey had the Chicken Parmesan.  She said it was ok.  Chicken was nicely breaded and juicy but she disliked that pasta sauce was a bit too sweet for her taste. I gave it four stars because:for me the tables are a bit short for the average person and totally dislike the cheap grated parmesan cheese.  I know its a small place in a not very good neighborhood but prices are not that cheap to at least not offer fresh cheese. Made me doubt a bit about the freshness of the rest of my meal.    Must add that staff is very friendly and attentive, and the live piano music just adds a lovely romantic touch to the moment.

I hadn't been here for about a year and let me tell you that I was impress with updates on menu and service.   I went today for lunch with my sister, who by the way hadn't been there ever.  We were greeted  and seated immediately as we walked in by a very friendly waitress.  My sister and I had the "firecrackers jalape√±os" as appetizer and order the "tres quesos", "rainbow roll" and "Culichi roll" to share.  Let me tell you, all of them are to die for. Best part is that this rolls are huge and very affordable.  My sister wanted to order a fourth roll just cause she is so used to sushi at other places were they come very small and only six slices. But I warned her that this place is nothing but generous on their portions.  We were extremely satisfied with our food and service.   To be honest, it took me this long to go back just because last few times I'd been there before today, waitresses were not friendly and took for ever to get our drinks and food delivered.  But this time everything was perfect.  I don't give them a 5 stars just because I believe their rolls need to be a bit tighter since we had to rush picking up the pieces and eating them before they crumble. But other than that I totally recommend this place.  Just be warned, portions are BIG so if u don't eat to much just order one roll or order a couple to share. Also be adventurous and try some of the Latin Rolls. I assure you won't regret it!!  Can't wait to go back!!!

Place is nice and clean!!  Service fast and friendly. I'd been here twice and I'm just happy this place is so close to me.  I like that u have the option of getting regular size or large bowl of pho.  Since everywhere I'd been before only serves the huge kind of bowls that I end up finishing and feeling miserable for over eating. (Yeah that is my bad not the restaurant's)  The reason they don't get 5 stars is cause even when Pho broth is good and light it was still missing something in the flavor.  I have no idea what, but definitely misses something.  Definitely not the best I had but not bad at all!! Spring rolls are big and good. My daughter love the fried rolls.  I will definitely recommend this place and will be a regular customer for sure!!

All I have to say is that every bite of any of their crepes is like putting a little bit of heaven in ur mouth!! Soooooo good!!! The Chipotle, the Morning and the Nutella crepes are my favorite.  They are so good I haven't give my self a chance to try the rest of the crepes.  Coffees, teas and frappes are delicious as well.  Great, clean, with a comfy atmosphere and great service keeps bringing me back and introducing this place to my family and friends.    Needless to say they also loved this place.

Let's begin with. Place was hot!!! The AC was either not working or owner was trying to save some money.  Portions are small and prices are big. Food quality was ok.  Would I recommend this place? Not likely and most likely I will not be back either.

I found this place by accident!! And oh boy am I glad I did!!  If you like Mexican botanas this is ur place. They have two bars full of yummy ingredients like fruit, Tostitos, cacahuates, tamarindos, cerpentinas, Doritos, hot Cheetos and more that u get to choose to put in ur cup and then get mixed up with ur choice of sauces like tamarindo, Clamato, chamoy, lime juice and some spicy sauce they have. They also corn in a cup, which by the way is the best I had tried in town. Tastes like you are actually eating it on the streets of Mexico. They have Clamato cups that u get prepared the way u want. Also have raspados, and strawberries with cream. Everything looks so fresh and clean.  I will definitely be back!!!
