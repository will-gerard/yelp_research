We definitely weren't the easiest group, and I really appreciated the great service that we had last night.  Our party arrived noisily- 3 adults and 4 rather rambunctious kids. We asked to sit on their lovely, heated patio, but quickly realized that the kids were not going to be agreeable for a nice meal... so we opted to place an order to go. My son and I shared the yellow chicken curry and pad Thai. Both were fresh and flavorful with just the right amount of heat. You know it is good when a seven-year old asks for a third helping! I only wish there had been more rice... I have leftover curry to eat and we finished the rice last night! I'll be back for sure!

Great, authentic, delicious Indian food.  We are always excited to make the trip over here, knowing we'll get some REAL Indian food.  The samosas, garlic naan, biryani, and lamb korma are among my favorites, and should always be had with a mango lassi.  Ah, perfection.    The only thing that is making me hesitant to give that last star is their lunch buffet.  Not the biggest selection - which wasn't a huge deal... still plenty to eat. The problem was the temperature of everything.  I was seriously afraid that I was going to get food poisoning (I didn't, thank goodness).  This can not be a safe temp to keep food at for more than 10 minutes!  Although, the husband claims that it is pretty much the same at all Indian buffets... you can tell, I usually just order off the menu wherever I go.    Definitely stick to the menu, and your experience will be 5-stars.  Attempt the buffet at your own risk...

After moving to Central Phoenix... 2 years ago... I figured it was finally time to find myself a new dentist.  Like any modern girl, I asked all of my facebook friends for a referral, and ended up with a glowing recommendation of Dr. Davis's practice.  Since it had been a little too long between cleanings, the process took a long time and wasn't exactly pleasant... but I'm fully aware that this was my own doing.  I was incredibly impressed at how meticulous the hygienist was, and she was super friendly too.  Dr. Davis was fantastic (and I'm not just saying this because he told me I don't have any cavities!).  He was personable, responsive to my questions, and very knowledgeable.  I'm happy to have found a new dentist and am (sort-of) looking forward to my next visit... which will be soon, of course!

Our car needed an oil change... and then, suddenly, the air would only blow warm.  Never good in June!  We made the mistake of taking it to the VW dealership, and was told that the relay (whatever that is...) needed to be replaced and that it would cost me $360.  Ugh.  Soooo... the Husband (much more knowledgeable about car stuff) gave Precision Imports a call.  They told him to bring the car in to them and they'd make sure it was less.  No kidding!! They got the work done asap, and only charged us $125.   Savings of OVER $200!  Now, THAT is good service!  They just made loyal customers out of us... no more dealerships for our car!

The Husband and I needed bikes.  Why?  Well, to ride to Luci's, of course!  And how else would you take a ride to your favorite local coffee shop, but in a darling cruiser-type bike purchased from a cute little local bike shop?  The service and selection at Sun Cyclery were top-notch.  Adam was incredibly helpful on each of my (count 'em) 4 visits when deciding which bike to purchase.  Since looks were my main criteria for choosing a bike, he made sure that I could deck out my new ride with a wicker basket and shiny bell.  Does it get any better than that?  I love love love my bike (as does the Husband) and just can't wait until the weather is suitable for showing off ... ahem... riding once again.

I arrived mid-day, with one goal in mind - buying a new mattress for the guest room.  This should have been a very quick purchase, since I pretty much knew exactly what I wanted.  Unfortunately, the salesperson didn't even bother to acknowledge my presence for over 5 minutes.  Finally, I got a quick "hi", and he went back to his other customer.  I walked up and down every aisle in the store, waiting, waiting, waiting, while he walked them from bed to bed while they tried laying on each one.  Seriously? I could have chosen and paid for my bed in the amount of time it took them to try out just one!  Someone needs to instruct him on handling multiple customers at once.  Two isn't really that many! Since the salesman was clearly more interested in serving them, I left and bought my bed at Mattress Firm instead.

Breakfast is usually my favorite meal to eat out... the only thing that I look forward to even more is the very occasional fancy-pants brunch.  I had the good fortune to be treated to an amazing meal at Wright's... and now I just need to figure out another special occasion that warrants a special outing back to the Biltmore.  Our service was fantastic, as expected at the Biltmore.  Water glasses were always full, napkins nicely arranged while we were up, and plates removed quickly.    The menu is kind of interesting... you can "order" the buffet or one of their entrees (which includes the buffet.  The buffet alone is $30... but the entrees are barely more than that.  For $5-10 more, you will have one of the most amazing meals ever... PLUS the amazing array of goodies from the buffet.  Do yourself a big favor and order the Eggs Benedict.  I'm not a poached egg fan, so I always order them scrambled... and this was seriously the most perfectly created breakfast dish I've ever had... anywhere.   We also enjoyed the salmon, but were less thrilled with the lobster and scallop roll.  Honestly, I could barely eat my entree because of my over-indulgence of buffet items... so the staff kindly boxed it for me to-go.  Talk about the best take-out meal ever!  The buffet had a great assortment of cheese and antipasta, assorted salads, pastries, huge shrimp and crab legs, a tasty ceviche, a couple types of sushi and more.  The star of the show was the dessert table.  I literally tried EVERY dessert they had out (don't worry... I was sharing!)... my favorites were the coconut cream tart, molten chocolate cake, peanut butter chocolate cup, cheesecake and toffee-chocolate chip cookies.  Mmmmm... I think I may have just gotten diabetes, just from this meal alone.  This is definitely a splurge place for me... and I can't wait for an occasion to return.

When it was suggested that we head to Keegan's for dinner, I was pretty interested.  The Yelp reviews are fairly good, and the food choices seemed interesting.  However, we just had one issue after another during our visit.  To begin, we really wanted to partake in the happy hour. Unfortunately, they were only allowing patrons on the patio and in the bar use that pricing and menu.  Normally, I would understand this and sit there, but we had a handicapped member of our party who was incapable of sitting at the high-top tables in the bar area, and there was smoking on the patio. Yuck!  We mentioned this to our server, who just said that it was too bad we couldn't take part.    We ordered a number of things at our table.  The daily special of brisket (I think) was ordered by 2 of our guests, and it looked and tasted delicious.  I wish I had ordered that!  I shared the queso dip to start.  Great chips, good pretzel bites, but terrible queso!  It reminded me more of a saucer of milk.  It was so ridiculously runny that it just poured off of the chip and made a mess all over the table, as I tried to get it to my mouth.  The taste wasn't bad, but it was just impossible to eat.  The fried chicken, sliders, and grilled cheese were all decent, but none stood out.  I was greatly underwhelmed by the cobbler.  There was very little fruit, and the dessert was greatly lacking.   While looking around at other tables, it appeared that many diners has delicious looking meals.  Perhaps the fail was in what we chose to order?  I would consider a re-visit, but this definitely isn't a spot I'm anxious to return to.

Oh, how I LOVE the donuts here!  Seriously, the most amazingly fresh donuts you will ever eat.  I have probably had every single variety offered, and still haven't found one that doesn't meet my donut-snob standard.  My favorites are the pink-frosted sprinkle cake donut, cinnamon crumb in cake and raised form, and the maple bars.  We have called ahead for large orders, which were always perfectly executed.  I only wish that this spot was on my way to work... although I'm gaining weight just thinking about it.    I'm ONLY taking off a star because their bathroom is seriously disgusting.  Really.  Don't go in there. EVER.   But, ignoring that downside... this is the BEST donut shop in all of AZ!

Oh, Spinato's!  Somehow your unbelievably delicious Mama's Original pizza made a spinach-lover out of my 4-year-old.  Amazing!  We also love the Spicy Italian (who doesn't like spicy Italians?!).  The antipasto salad with half spinach is always crisp, fresh and delicious.  Extra points for the gluten-free crust option!  Spinato's is the perfect place to bring a family or grab a pizza to go.

Although I have yet to have my hair cut at this salon, I come here just about every 6 weeks to have hair painfully ripped off of my face.  I have tried a lot of different salons around town, and Jessica is by far the loveliest and most friendly aesthetician I have ever had! She nearly makes the waxing experience pleasant :)  Definitely a place I'll be staying loyal to!

Obviously there are more gourmet Chinese food restaurants around... but Panda always hits the spot for me.  The service is always speedy and friendly (at all of the many locations I've visited), and the food is pretty darn tasty.  The Beijing Beef and new Honey Sesame chicken are tasty, and you can't skip the chow mein noodles.  Yum!

I've been to Flo's numerous times over the years, but there seems to be a downward trend.  It looks like I'll be finding a new Asian Fusion spot...  The Man and I had a couple hours to kill and hungry bellies to feed, so we popped into Flo's for their (seemingly) amazing happy hour.  I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.  Just a thought...  Now I'm off on a journey for a new go-to Asian spot!

Of course, Sur la Table is known for their amazing array of cooking essentials (and non-essentials too!), but today's review is focusing on the fantastic cooking class options that they offer.  I had the pleasure of taking a 3 hour cooking class with my mom and sister - so much fun!  They offer the perfect blend of exhibition and hands-on... you get to try some new techniques, but you don't have to cook EVERYTHING yourself.  We had an amazing menu of Osso Bucco, cheesy polenta, creamed leeks (omg amazing!), and biscotti-like cookies with macerated strawberries.  It was a wonderful way to spend an evening.  Unfortunately, this perfect date-night activity comes with a steep price: $60-$80/per person.  Eek!  This will definitely remain only a very occasional splurge for me (or just when mom is paying!).

Why does it seem like there is an inverse relationship with the size and quality of restaurants? Unfortunately for Los Olivos, this means that although they are a super-sized restaurant (I think my whole neighborhood would fit in here for dinner), their service and food are lacking.  I was dining with a large group and our servers seemed overwhelmed and confused the entire time.  I asked for water. Twice. I left my meal STILL thirsty.  Isn't water one of those things that restaurants bring patrons no matter what?  I ordered a margarita with no salt.  Would've been delicious... except it was loaded up with a salty rim. Bleh.  My friend and I shared the Pollo Fundido, which was pretty standard.  No complaints about it, but nothing stood out either.   Would I return? Nope.  There are SO many quality Mexican food restaurants in town that I will be choosing somewhere else next time!

Who would have thought that such a hole-in-the-wall spot in a semi-suspect location would have such great food?  Luckily, my fellow yelpers pointed me in the right direction, since I never would have stumbled upon this gem on my own.  Since I was dining with a group, I was able to sample a wide variety of items, and my stomach was so happy for the variety.  The many appetizers I tried were delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the papaya salad, Thai toast, and fried tofu bites.  For dinner, we had the veggie curry and pineapple fried rice.  Both were delicious, well-seasoned, and made perfect leftovers the next day.  Despite the drive, this has moved into the top spot on my Thai take-out list.  Be sure to be patient if you come with a large group - there is only one server and one cook.  However, if you don't mind a leisurely pace (and perhaps refilling your own water), the food will make you smile!

I love this place!  I don't know how I lived in Anthem for the past 6 months without knowing of its existence, but I am so glad that I discovered it.  The service is fantastic.  Such great people - I love that it is family run and that they are closed on Sundays.  Don't forget to check in on the yelp app - free chips and salsa!   My absolute favorite item is the Mexican pizza.  Don't let the higher price point sway you.  It is worth every penny of the $12.95 and definitely feeds 2-3.  The California burrito and Horchata are also deeeeeelicious.    I'm excited to return, and think I'll have to swing by for a breakfast burrito soon.

As stated and restated in hundreds of reviews before mine: the chicken and waffles are absolutely sublime.  If you are envisioning greasy fried chicken with soggy, limp waffles - you have to completely rethink things.  This is the elite version, and it is worth the trip to Vegas for them.  The chicken is roasted to perfection; crispy skin, but not fried.  The delectable combination of the bacon and chive flecked waffles, vanilla bean butter, warm syrup, and chasseur sauce was incredible and unbeatable.  I have returned two more times for the same meal!  We also enjoyed the beignets, and especially loved the accompanying jam.  The servings were plenty big enough to share. The service has been terrific on all of our visits, but I prefer to sit at the bar.  The service at the bar is wonderful, and the bartenders are engaging and interesting.   This is a must-visit, don't miss spot on your next trip to Vegas.

I stopped by FEZ to have a drink with a girlfriend... and wasn't exactly impressed.  The service at the bar was surprisingly poor.  I practically had to wave my arms and do a little dance to get anyones' attention.  While my drink (something pink and fruity) was pretty tasty, the sugar rim was ridiculous!  The condensation from the glass made the sugar turn to a simple syrup which proceeded to coat my entire hand in sugary goo.  Yuck!  I finally gave up, just so I didn't have to touch the glass anymore.  The menu looked interesting, and I'm more than willing to give it a try for lunch or dinner... but lesson learned: no sugar-rimmed drinks... I'll stick with a margarita next time!

Anyone who gives out freshly-baked cookies for FREE gets a nod from me!  And, since Husband is Gluten-free, I always get to eat his too... a definite win-win.  We've dragged the child here on two occasions - brunch and dinner.  While it isn't really the right atmosphere if you have a loud or very "busy" child, ours is pretty accustomed to the restaurant "drill" by now and is generally good, as long as we keep the food a'comin'.  I have to say, Chelsea's kitchen was more than friendly with our little guy and their kids' menus and plates are super cute!    As far as the adult food goes, we've been really happy with everything we've tried.  Stand-outs have been the brussel sprout salad, veggie burger, and their killer wild-rice salad.  I loved their simple omelet and pomegranate mimosa for breakfast, and Husband thought this chiaquiles were pretty good (however, Gallo Blanco has them beat here).  I ordered a (probably) yummy posole on one visit, and made the mistake of squeezing the lime into it before tasting it first - WHOA!  Apparently, they had already seasoned it perfectly before bringing it out... and I sort-of ruined it with overwheming limeyness.  The waitress offered a couple of times to bring out a new one... but I felt compelled to eat it anyways, since the mistake was my own.  I really appreciated their offer, though.  The restaurant ad patio are just gorgeous.  A large, roaring fire is the perfect backdrop for a meal.  I would definitely recommend Chelsea's for a romantic, child-free evening.  We always time our visits at non-peak hours, so we haven't experienced much of the normal atmosphere, but have had solid service and darn good food both times... next time: fried chicken!

We have been back a few more times since my original review, and each time I discover a new dish to love.  When stopping by for lunch, the Husband and I ordered the nachitos - mistakenly thinking that the appetizer would be relatively small... we were SO wrong!  It was so incredibly gigantic that the two of had absolutely no hope in finishing it... even though we were sharing.  Our server was really fantastic and immediately noticed that our speed was slowing down.  He offered to go ahead and box up our carne asada tacos for us to enjoy when we weren't quite as stuffed.  Good call!  The tacos were delectable - even when reheated later that night.   Last night, my sister and I stopped by for dessert.  I am in love with the key lime pie!  The small scoop of strawberry gelato in the perfect foil to the sweet-tart lime.  We also had the chocolate brownie/cake, which my sister devoured.  It wasn't my favorite, but I think I just wasn't in the mood for chocolate (strange, but true).  I also sampled the French Press coffee.  It was really tasty, and I'll definitely order it the next time I'm in for brunch.  Strangely, our waitress forgot to bring out sugar - despite me asking for it after she brought out the carafe of coffee.  Luckily, my dessert was sweet enough to compensate, and I managed to drink my sugar-less coffee anyways.    Chelsea's Kitchen puts out a consistently strong product, has a gorgeous interior and patio - and usually has friendly and attentive service (excusing a few minor glitches... no big deal!).  It is becoming one of our go-to places for a great meal - brunch, lunch, dinner or dessert - Chelsea's has it all!  PS- the free chocolate-chip sea salt cookies were super yummy too!

Sierra Bonita has an absolutely killer happy hour.  You can get yourself  an amazingly strong Pomegranate margarita and a sampling of some of the tastiest (and cheapest) appetizers around town.  The scallops and bacon wrapped shrimp and divine, and the tamale is one of the best in the valley.    The restaurant has a great dark and cozy feel... perfect for a date night out.  The outdoor patio is well shaded, and is one of my favorite spots to sit.  They also have a couple of fantastic private rooms on the lower level, if you need that kind of thing.  Though this is a frequent happy hour stop for me, I haven't actually had dinner there... I should probably check out the main menu and enjoy Sierra Bonita in all its glory!

Ugh.  I like good food.  I love good service.  This place provided neither, unfortunately.  The food was average at best.  We had the breakfast burrito, and the guac and salsa were both clearly straight from the grocery store.  The coffee tasted like poorly made Maxwell House, and the oj definitely wasn't fresh squeezed.  The service took forever, and it wasn't worth the wait.  Maybe this stuff is better when you're either drunk or hungover?  When totally sober, you should definitely opt for something else.  Even just sticking with Starbucks would have been a much safer option (and cheaper, too!).

Ticoz - you are near and dear to my happy-hour heart.  I LOVE your endless supply of fruity, delicious and strong drinks.  I've actually had to designate a driver just to have HALF of a mojito!  Your bar service has always been top-notch, and I love bringing friends along to try your endless selection of sweet drinks.  As for the food - I love the bar menu.  Cheap, good food that can soak up some of the alcohol.  I particularly like the burgers and the green chili with homemade chips.  Mmmm.  Is it time for a drink yet??

I can't even begin to describe how much I love this place.  I have now eaten here 3 times, and each visit this spot just gets better and better.  We have never eaten in the main dining room; we prefer the atmosphere and happy hour/lunch special in the front bar area.  The cozy couches are a great spot, but the bar is really where it is at.  The drinks, conversation, food tips, and amazing service from Brett, the bartender, are second to none.  He really knows how to make people feel welcome and well taken care of.  I loved hearing about all the drinks he was making.  He truly is an expert at his job.  We have also enjoyed the hostess/waitress, Lindsey, on two of our visits.  Such a great staff!   Aside from the superb service, the food is perfection.  The layers of flavors, the unique dishes, and the execution of each meal is spot-on every time.  This is a MUST visit spot when you're in Vegas - a well-priced, fabulous meal with great service.  Don't miss it!

Host seemed confused about where to seat us... my glass was dirty... I could barely understand our waiter... my food was lukewarm... our request for fresh parmesan cheese was met with a shaker of the white powdery stuff.    Why, oh why, do I venture into chain restaurants?

I've been here about a million times over the past few years, but somehow never thought to write a review.  I really dig Pei Wei.  It is so much fresher tasting than typical Chinese take-out, and it is my go-to don't-want-to-cook-tonight place.  I love their online ordering (and iphone app) - it is quick, easy, and painless.  As far as the food goes, most everything is delish.  My personal fav is the crab wontons.  I'm seriously OBSESSED with these... they are nothing like the cream-cheese puffs found elsewhere, thank goodness!  They actually have CRAB in them!  I also like the orange chicken, thai curry, kung pao, and salads.  Not a huge fan of their pad thai, but there are so many other options that I hardly miss it.  I do miss the caramel chicken special... it was delicious, and I'm bummed it didn't make the permanent menu.   Pei Wei is an example of a chain done right - clean, quick, consistent and tasty.  I'll be back - again and again and again.

My friends and I are happy hour regulars around Central Phoenix.  We're always in search of a good deal and good food/drinks.  The good deal was found at Half Moon... the good food was NOT.  We ordered 4 appetizers to share during our recent happy hour, and I was completely underwhelmed.    The pretzel - the high point of the apps. Simple, tasty.  Perhaps a little too salty, but nonetheless, yummy.  Chips with queso - Queso?  Really?  More like microwaved Velveeta with some salsa stirred in.  Just screamed "processed food".  There are so many places with a quality queso dip around - Half moon should ask for a recipe suggestion.  Boneless wings - Not bad.  Fairly tasty little nuggets.  Unfortunately, there were only about 6 tiny little pieces.  They obviously price them high to make up for your happy hour savings.  Frito/Chili Nacho thing - Really? That's IT? Just a handful of Fritos with some seemingly canned chili poured over the top.  SO boring.   Half Moom: Please, please, please... don't rely on your happy hour prices and big tvs to bring people back.  Without decent food, I definitely have no incentive to return.

Whaaaat?  Friends recommended this, Yelp had pretty solid reviews, and we got a great vibe upon entering.  The place was packed, which is always a good sign, and we lucked out to find a spot immediately at the bar.  I have to say that despite it being a busy holiday weekend, the service at the bar was impeccable.  They were engaging, friendly, and clearly working their tails off.    That's where the good stuff ended though.  The menu looked great at first glance, and we had a difficult time deciding what to order... so we asked for help from the bartender.  She recommended the fried chicken, biscuit, potato breakfast dish.  It seemed like a good choice, but when it arrived, it was honestly just too much.  Too many components... too large of portions... you honestly couldn't tell where one thing started and another thing ended.  It was just a huge bunch of slop on a plate.  We shared it, and there was still plenty leftover.  I think if they had a more restrained concept of the dish, it would've worked so much better.  The mimosas (tangerine and pineapple) were okay.  I wish we would've tried one of the delicious looking iced coffee drinks we saw headed to other tables.  But, with our lack-of-luck with the meal, we decided to just call it a day and head out!

I stopped by for the most delicious potato/cheese soup.  Ahhh... comforting, flavorful and just delicious.  A few nights later, I had the absolutely pleasure of tasting a variety of Wildflower's offerings at a Yelp Event.  The butternut squash ravioli was incredible.  I could've eaten a few platefuls of that goodness... but I had to save room for the turkey/cranberry/stuffing sandwich, which was like a little bite of Thanksgiving.    I need to return to try the huge number of pastries and other baked goods... and work my way through the rest of the menu.  This is definitely a place that will be in my regular rotation of quick-stop spots.

We live around the corner, but had never heard of Fuego until Groupon ran a special a couple months ago.  We finally got around to using our coupon tonight - SO glad we did!  I can't believe that Fuego seems to remain a well-kept secret... it is really fantastic.  The guitar player-singer that was there this evening was great - such a nice surprise!  Husband and I were greeted by the host upon our arrival.  I LOVED him.  What an awesome, vibrant personality... and he recommended a killer peach-grapefruit mojito - mmmm!  We shared the Salmon Croquettes, Empanadas, and the delicious Chicken dinner (I'm sure it had a name...).  All of the dishes were presented beautifully, had fantastic flavor, and persuaded us to not only clean out plates, but to order dessert too!  The side dishes of jalapeno creamed corn and green chile cornbread casserole were SO good.  I would have ordered a dinner made up strictly of side dishes, had that been an option... the maple-chili glazed carrots and chipotle mashed potatoes were also calling my name, but they'll have to wait for my next visit.  We finished up with the Horchata Bread Pudding.  Yum!  I liked the contrasting texture of the fried and sugared flour tortilla strips on top.    During our meal, we had fantastic service.  They took their time, and we never felt rushed... which is a change from many restaurants around town.  We really felt like we could sit back, enjoy the music, and chill as long as we wanted to.  I'm looking forward to a return visit... probably for Happy Hour very soon(how can you turn down those prices?!).

We took our 4-year-old to a birthday party at CrackerJax this past weekend.  The arcade was full of fun games... but too bad many of them ate our tokens, played for only a few seconds before shutting off, or lacked necessary parts.  The two basketball games that we played were an absolute joke - one had 5 semi-flat balls, and the other one only had one large ball.  Who knows where the rest were!  We were definitely disappointed with the upkeep of their games.  If a main part of your business is the arcade, then it is pretty frustrating for a customer to waste 10% of their tokens on lousy, broken, poorly kept games.   If you are going to CrackerJax, I would avoid the arcade and focus on the outdoor activities, instead.

Now, it is no secret that I love all things sweet.  So, naturally, a place like Urban Cookies would be at the top of my list for indulgences... and it definitely is.    The assortment of cookies and cupcakes is perfect.  There are about a half-dozen options of each - enough to give variety but not overwhelm.  I am a huge fan of the Urban Dark and Tropic cookie.  They are the perfect balance of sweet, nutty, chewy goodness.  I just tried my first cupcake yesterday - caramel buttercream atop an apple spice cake.  Mmmm.  One of the better (if not best) cupcakes in town.  And, under $2?  Definitely makes my wallet happy.   The numerous options for holiday and corporate gifts look interesting.  Something to keep in mind for hostess gifts this coming holiday season!

Urban Cookies - I love you.  Ollie Cakes - I REALLY love YOU!   I am a girl with a massive sweet-tooth.  There is nothing better sounding to me that a shop that sells nothing other than cookies and cupcakes (well, and drinks, of course).  Most cupcakeries are a huge disappointment to me - overpriced and underwhelming.  Ollie Cakes, on the other hand, are scrumptious! They are reasonably priced (so I never feel bad when I get 2...), and seriously the most delicious in town.  I especially love the carrot cake flavor.  Mmmm.   Must go back.  Daily.  Hmm... maybe that would be bad for me?

I just went by yesterday, in hopes of finding the perfect little baby gift... but the store looked closed. Permanently. Bummer.

The Husband and I have had our eyes on St Francis for a couple of months now, and finally made it over for our anniversary dinner.  Another amazing Central Phoenix repurposing project gone amazingly well - bravo!  It is just gorgeous inside.  I loved everything from the open kitchen design to the outdoor lounge; the collection of cookbooks along the wall to the open air bar.  Perfection!  We decided to sit at the very front bar, so I could spy on the kitchen and take a look at all of the offerings coming out (plus, I wanted to make sure we got the well-priced $5 cocktails for happy hour).  I began with the Meyer Lemonade-vodka concoction, and the Husband tried his luck with the almond margarita.  The almondy-twist on a traditional margarita was surprisingly good.  Definitely something I would order in the future.  The lemonade was light and bright, but possibly too boring for my taste.  For round two, the Husband tried the Dark and Stormy.  He seemed to enjoy it, but I thought it was a bit heavy on the ginger for my liking.  Our waitress seemed a little out of practice.  She failed to mention the dinner specials until we had finished both drinks, placed our appetizer order, and already decided on our meal choice.  Strange.  Then, she seemed to disappear for much of the time, and we were taken care of by a much friendlier and knowledgeable waitress, only to have her reappear at the end of the meal.  We had a lovely time chatting with the chef who was in charge of the brick oven.  He helped us to decide which flatbread to order (we went with the bacon/onion marmalade/arugula), and we were SO pleasantly surprised when he then served us a half portion of the other flatbread as well!  What amazing service.  And, for the record, I actually liked the second flatbread even better than the first!  We ordered the green-chili pork stew with a side of polenta.  The stew was truly fantastic.  The pork was so tender and it was the perfect level of heat for my palate.  The accompanying cornbread was divine!  I wish that we had been given an entire cake!  We were painfully full by this point, so we had to forgo dessert... however we will definitely return to work our way through the rest of the menu!

We have had two visits to this dental office (Dr. Jacobson is our dentist).  I was immediately impressed by the office staff.  They are friendly and sociable, and even remembered specifics about my child on our second visit a month later.  I love that kind of attention to detail!  The waiting room is adorably decorated in a pirate theme.  There are touch-screen computers with sports video games that even the little kids can easily play, plus a number of other activities to keep the kids engaged.  I swear, I'm thinking about bringing my son here during the hot summer - just to play! ;)  During our consult and cavity-filling session with Dr. Jacobson, I was incredibly impressed.  He was caring and genuine, and took the time to explain all of our options in great detail.  He knew we had switched dentists because of their aggressive treatment plan, and was very considerate of our comfort level with the procedure.  I am so happy that we switched dentists.    Places and people like this are a true find!

Just writing this review makes me feel centered and at peace.  I have been practicing yoga on and off for about 7 years at At One Yoga.  I have been at nearly every type of class offered: yin, prenatal, power, flow, basic, body-rolling, you-name-it!  There is a class/teacher for every taste... great music, incredible instruction and an awesome vibe.

Delicious food... in a mall?!  Oh yes, it can be done.  Thanks to Nordstrom, I have a consistently good spot to lunch anytime I'm at Fashion Square.  Their little cafe on the 3rd level is actually good enough to make the trip to, even if you have no shopping to do.    Their salads are fresh, with loads of tasty toppings.  My favorites are the cilantro shrimp salad with polenta croutons, Chinese chicken salad, and spicy salmon cesaer salad.  Paired with a cup of their famous tomato-basil soup, and I'm completely satisfied.  Their pastries are quite tasty, and I can rarely pass up a slice of their lemon-coconut cake.  You really should go and get a slice.    Next time you are at Fashion Square, don't miss this perfect lunch spot!  **my 100th review!  I think I should go and get a slice of lemon-coconut cake to celebrate!**

Portions are ridiculously huge and prices are cheap - win win!  We shared a Chicken Fried Steak breakfast which was pretty darn tasty.  I wasn't very impressed with the pancakes or biscuits, although I certainly ate them anyways.  The steak was tasty, however and the gravy was tasty.  I took advantage of Yelp's check-in offer for a free pastry, but was disappointed in my bear claw.  It was no better than one I'd pick up at a grocery store's bakery.  You know it couldn't have been amazing if I only took two bites of a pastry!   If you're in need of a standard, cheap diner-style breakfast... go check it out! But if you crave something above typical diner-style fare, keep looking!

I'm pissed. Now that Man vs. Food has shown my favorite little hole-in-the-wall spot to the world, word is officially out!  I've actually had to -gasp!- wait for a table. Twice. Ugh. ;)  Seriously though - how could someone not love Los Reyes?  They have prompt, courteous service and the food is awesome.  Portions are large, and we always end up with food for the next day.  I love that the waitresses always remember to put extra salsa in the take-out bag.  It is some tasty stuff!  Favorites of ours include:  Mexicana Torta Chicken Tinga Quesadilla del Estilo Hawaiian tacos - I love pineapple and ham in anything!  Carne Asada tacos Lime Agua Frescas Mango/Coconut Licuados   Do yourself a favor and get yourself down to Sunnyslope to check this spot out.  The prices are ridiculously good, and the food is authentic and just freakin' delicious.  Don't miss it.

Perhaps our "eh" experience was magnified because we arrived at Bomberos right after having dined at Postino for dinner.  The huge difference between the quality of service was hard to miss!  Our group of 6 was quickly seated, and the hostess was kind enough to turn up the heater to make sure we were warm enough.  That was the highlight of the service.  Now, the service was definitely not rude... it wasn't inconsiderate... it was just... well... not very good.  Our waitress (and apparently the chef) could not tell us the ingredients in any of the desserts.  Even though they source their desserts from Tammie Coe, why don't they know what is in them?  For people with allergies, this can make or break a meal.  Since we couldn't confirm the ingredients, my husband had to make do with a coffee, while I indulged in the Creme Brulee.  It was good.  Pleasant, but certainly nothing spectacular.  The few times our waitress came by to check on our group, she seemed to have strange timing... like she didn't really know how to leave... she just sort of stood there a few seconds too long, until it was slightly awkward.  Strange.  Then, we wouldn't see her for large stretches of time... we were getting thirsty with no water refills!    I'm hoping it was just an off night/server... and we'll definitely try again, as we really loved the outdoor patio and roaring fire.  Beautiful and romantic!  We'll cross our fingers for improvements with the service.

First of all, I'm completely amazed at people who complain about portion size.  When you go to a restaurant and order a meal, you are supposed to be ordering ONE portion.  Our country has gotten so used to seeing 5x portions on a plate that our gauge for an appropriate amount of food is WAY off!  And people wonder why we're (as a country) turning into a huge bunch of overweight complainers...  Anyways...  I love OverEasy.  We discovered it about a month before the Food Network special, and that certainly got the word out... so now we have to plan on getting there a little earlier if we want to avoid a wait.  Since we have a 3 year old, we try to avoid waiting at all costs!  Arriving before 8 seems to do the trick.  We've always had great service on our 5+ visits, nothing to complain about.  On our first visit, my french toast with caramelized bananas had too much salt, and it was quickly and kindly taken care of by our waitress with many apologies.  Some of my favorite items are the blueberry muffins with lemon curd - amazingly delicious, fried chicken with waffle,  omelets (which were so large that I took half of it home!), and the wolfpack (my husband's fave).  The only meal we've had that we didn't really love was the ham with red-eye gravy... not a fan of the gravy, but we hadn't had it before and didn't really know what taste to expect.  Of course, I WISH they would be open 24/7 to suit my own personal schedule, but I understand that they are balancing the needs of their owners, employees, and maximizing their business during peak breakfast hours.  Definitely can't take away a star for that!   All in all, I think Over Easy is a wonderful central breakfast spot... can't go wrong with the variety of delectable breakfast goodness here!  ***edited to 4 stars... clicked the wrong one! I'm a big fan, but there is definitely a bit of room for some improvements :)

We returned for yet another delicious breakfast on Valentine's Day morning.  Our 3-year-old was in tow, so we were thankful to be seated immediately.  We have always been happy with the food, and today was no exception.  I wasn't terribly hungry, so I just had the blueberry muffins with lemon curd.  Is there a better combination?  Mmm!  The iced coffee with cardamom is a favorite of mine... but make SURE you like cardamom if you are going to order this drink... it is a very distinct, love-it-or-hate-it flavor, I think.   The most amazing part of our visit was the service.  Unlike most restaurants, the service actually seemed to get BETTER because we had a little one with us.  We had every server, host, manager stopping by our table with extra tater-tots for the boy, chatting us up, just being generally awesome.  I never get tired of attentive service!    Thanks for a great start to our Valentine's Day!

Over Easy, I thought we were friends.  I thought I could depend on you for a delicious breakfast, good service, and fun atmosphere.  Apparently, we are drifting apart, and need to start seeing other people.  I took my mom out to breakfast with a $30 deal from a dining website.  I use coupons like this all of the time at many different places, and have never had an issue.  But this experience was just weird.  Since I had $30 to spend, and only 2 people eating, I knew I'd have to order a little something to go, so I didn't waste my money.  Unfortunately, after taking our breakfast order, our waiter immediately brought us our check - BEFORE our food came out.  Uhhh... what?  But I hadn't even finished ordering!   They acted like I was being weird when I asked them to please add a protein bar to-go, and re-ring the bill.  So strange.   As for the atmosphere - I do NOT like the new place.  I feel like I am dining communally, because the tables are so freakin' close together.  Don't try and pack in so many tables that no one can enjoy the place and have their own space.    The food was okay.  The Mediterranean omelet was pretty bland, but the chiliquiles were good/average.  Our half-order of caramelized banana french toast was completely lack-luster.  It was drowning in a caramel-like sauce, but the sauce was lacking any real depth of flavor.  Pure maple syrup would have been a huge upgrade from their gooey mess.  All-in-all, I'm just not sure what has happened since our many good times back at the 40th St. location.  There are way too many great breakfast spots in town for me to stuff myself, like a sardine, into Over Easy to eat mediocre food with poor service.  Sad.  I used to like you so much...

A big thank you to Brad, who invited me to try Over-Easy out again after my lackluster experience a few weeks back.  I love to see Yelp reuniting restaurants and patrons, creating harmony in the food world, once again.   Our service was about 1000x better on this visit.  Our server was thoughtful, attentive, and made sure that we were well taken care of.  Our meals were delicious.  None of the average food that we found last time... perhaps due to an increased sense about their strengths.  Just stick to what they are best at, and you'll be a happy camper.  I ordered the chicken and waffle.  The waffle could have been a little crisper, but the flavor was perfect.  The chicken was expertly seasoned, and the combination was only elevated by a large splash of hot sauce and lots of maple syrup.  Of course, you must be a fan of the sweet/spicy/savory combination to appreciate this dish.  My friend had a breakfast burrito that looked delicious, but I was actually more impressed with the side dish of fruit.  No silly bowl of melon here - just bright, fresh berries.  Mmm!  Definitely an upgrade from typical fruit garnishes.   I am still sad that there are so many tables, and a lack of defined space... but the improved food and service from my last visit definitely warrants a +2 star improvement.    Over Easy, we can still be friends :)

Thanks to Groupon, husband, I and two friends went to a show a few weeks ago @ NCT.  What fun!  As a former thespian, I was able to relive my own high-school improv days.  I love the audience participation bits - it was quite hilarious (and mildly disappointing, when you think about it) when people kept shouting out incorrect parts-of-speech.  Doesn't anyone know what an adverb is?! Alas, I'm not rating the audience...  The actors/comedians were entertaining, interactive and lots of fun to watch.  I especially liked the small, black-box theatre... makes for a nice intimate experience, where you actually feel like part of the show :)  A fun date night idea for any age.

I stopped by yesterday for the first time and was decidedly underwhelmed.  I get that consignment stores don't have the same bright-and-shiny displays of merchandise as mass-retailers do, but I would still appreciate some sense of order and organization.  I was stepping over huge boxes, half-filled with clothes, squeezing around loads of bigger baby items (high chairs, etc).  The back part was so stuffed full, that I actually thought it must be a storage room - certainly not suitably for a sales floor!  As far as the service goes... it was fairly average.  I was greeted kindly, but there was no effort to assist me in my quest for a gift.  It would have been awesome to have someone ask who I was shopping for, suggest something interesting, or just show an interest in the customer other than a quick "hello".  Since I live so close, I'll be sure to check back in on Hissyfits again.  I'm hoping that I just caught them on an off day!

I guess I'm guilty of judging a book by its cover... or a consignment shop by its mess.  While the store is definitely still very cluttered, I was able to look past that on my most recent visit and enjoy the great service and awesome finds.  After all, this isn't Nordstrom's - I should probably be more forgiving, since it means more product for ME to buy!   On my visit this morning, the women working were helpful and chatty.  They helped me find the dressing room/bathroom, added my name to a "wish list" (awesome service!) to call when they get certain products instock, and showed me where to look for cloth diapers.  If you are overwhelmed by the clutter, as I was - ask for help!  They are more than happy to show you where to look.    Glad I tried them again, and will definitely be back for more maternity clothes, baby items, and *hopefully* cloth diapers!

I have long been a fan of the Market Bistro location on Thunderbird, so when I spotted the newer location on Greenway yesterday, I HAD to stop in for a bite.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that kid's meals are FREE on Saturdays!  And, mind you, this is no mickey-d's trans-fat-laden meal... my son had grilled pesto chicken, homemade mac&cheese and a big bowl of fruit salad (grapes, pears, strawberries and apples). Healthy, delicious and free... can't beat it!   My meal was amazing.  I LOVE the pesto chicken sandwich, and should probably ask for an extra side of the corn mixture next time, because it is just so tasty.  My caesar salad had chives and sun-dried tomatoes, alonf with their delicious parmesan crisps and croutons.  The half-sandwich/salad meal was so large that I ended up taking half of the salad to go.  Two dinners for less than $10 - awesome!   Even better than that? The service.  They must take pride in the employees that they hire, because all three girls that were working were incredibly helpful, and made the restaurant feel more full-service, than fast-casual.  Now, if only Market Bistro would open up a spot in Midtown, I'd be even happier.  Please?  Pretty please???

Thanks to Groupon, I have found another great yoga studio at which to practice.  The space is really well designed, and the merchandising is incredibly well done.  The bathrooms/locker area are super clean, well-maintained, and it is nice to have a spot to tuck your stuff away... instead of just tossing it all on the floor, as I do at other studios.  I have attended a few classes and really enjoyed each one.  I'm not used to the lack of music, but I'm getting used to it... the classes move a little bit more slowly, but that seems to allow for more adjustments to be made - which I love!   I also had a massage, which was so relaxing.  I wish that was something that I could regularly splurge on... because it was fantastic.  After my month is up, I probably won't continue regularly, since the studio isn't super close to my house... but I definitely have some feel-good vibes for this spot.

I made my reservation so I could use my groupon before moving out of town... not realizing it was the middle of restaurant week.  This was a minor issue, and will just force a return visit to this fabulous spot (oh darn).  I was a little concerned that restaurant week might not be as stellar as expected, but I honestly can't imagine this meal getting any better.  We started with parsnip soup and polenta.  The parsnip soup had a delicious onion undertone, and was quickly slurped up.  The polenta was eaten VERY slowly... so we wouldn't miss a tiny second of savoring the amazingness.  It was THAT good.  The simple topping of crispy capicola and olives, drizzed with olive oil was pure genius.  If it had been an option, I would have forgone the rest of my meal in trade for a large vat of this polenta.   We had the vegetable risotto and salmon with farro next.  The salmon was perfectly done and I really enjoyed the bacon and braised kale that graced the farro.  Our server brought us the standard bowl of cotton candy, which I feel is unnecessarily large.  I mean, I like cotton candy as much as the next person... but about 1/3 of the portion would probably suffice and make the same fun, whimsical statement.  The desserts were next, and were superb.  The brightness of the passion fruit was an amazing ending to an incredible meal.    Our service was impeccable, and I loved the touch of being sent off with a little piece of chocolate-chip shortbread.  Though, sadly, I put the bag in my purse and forgot about it for 2 weeks... I'm not sure if it was any good or not, but the thought was appreciated!   This is definitely on my must-recommend list, and I hope I am able to visit again soon.

I had no idea how much I would like Asian Tapas, but they were pretty darn good.  I am a fairly adventurous diner, which definitely is preferable at Sens, though my less-adventurous dining partner still found many items to try and share.   My favorite items were the chicken and cheese wontons, Hong Kong Noodles, and Pineapple-Ginger fried tofu.  Ohhh... that tofu was something magical - and I got it all to myself!  The lemongrass chicken was also good, though I would probably get something a little more exciting next time.  I wasn't a big fan of the mango-papaya spring rolls or the 5-spice chicken wings.  The skin on the wings was rubbery and kind of off-putting, so we didn't end up finishing those.  Be warned about the sauces that accompany most of the tapas - they are HOT!  I love spicy foods, but still found that scooping out some of the chili paste before mixing the sauces together was necessary, so I didn't light my mouth on fire.  We finished with the green-tea cheesecake, and were pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  Tasty, and not too sweet.  The lychees on top were a nice touch.  We had fantastic service, despite arriving on First Friday without a reservation.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar, though we will remember to call ahead for a table next time.  I'm glad that I was finally able to try Sens, and look forward to returning.

True Food has so much going for it - a well thought out menu, delicious flavor combinations, a killer kids' menu, and good service.    We've been many, many times, and have always enjoyed ourselves.  The Husband and I particularly like the menu coding system (vegetarian? gluten-free? you know EXACTLY what you can/can't order).  The mock-tails are deliciously refreshing... light, bright flavors that just taste good for you!  The Husband swears by the crudite appetizer... and even I, who doesn't always love the green things, really enjoyed it.  The curry dish is my personal fave, and the carne asada tacos are pretty darn good, too.  The kids' gluten-free pasta with red sauce, greens (kale??), and lots of cheese is enormous and totally worth the money.    A good stand-by place, especially when we're feeling like eatin' some healthy stuff :)

This review is ridiculously overdue... but because the cupcakes by Butter and Me are so fabulous, I'm STILL thinking about them.  They are the perfect texture, with the perfect amount of frosting, which has the perfect amount of sweetness.  PERFECT, I tell ya!  I am dying for Butter & Me to open up a store front, so I can indulge my cravings on a whim... please, please... let it be soon!

I can't believe that I neglected to write this review sooner.  This is quite possibly the best meal I've had to date - and that is saying quite a lot.  Not only is the concept absolutely amazing, but the execution really does live up to the hype.  I happened to go on a holiday, and was concerned that we might not receive the full glory that is Posh, but I was happily mistaken.  I can't imagine it getting any better.  My man and I checked off slightly different items, as I'm a bit more adventurous than he is.  This turned out to be a great thing, since we both ended up with very different courses, allowing us to taste each other's and try so many different things!   Here were our courses:  1: Popcorn Soup - so buttery and smooth as velvet! 1: Beet Soup - delicious and so pretty (and normally I think beets taste like dirt)  2: Scallops with edamame puree and fried leeks.  This was a huge highlight of the meal and I was SO happy we both got the same dish - I really didn't want  to share!  3: Shrimp with Japanese coleslaw pancake, bacon, and Asian bbq sauce. 3: Halibut cheek, celery puree, and grape balsamic reduction  4: Hot and sour soup with squid 4: Rabbit with parmesan veloute, crushed tomato, and asparagus  5: Frog legs with tumeric and gnocchi 5: Veal with mashed potatoes  6: Pork belly with cabbage and peas 6: Cheese plate with Parmesan foccacia  We were so glad that we made our reservation to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen.  Talking with the sous chef was so much fun.  He was so knowledgeable and made our meal even better!

Paradise Bakery, I have to admit... I have had some long held resentment against you, ever since the Panera debacle.  I'm still a little bitter that you blocked their entrance into the Phoenix market... but I digress.   Once my anger over the Panera situation started to fade, I decided that the crack-like addicting cookies at PB were still calling my name, so I returned begrudgingly.  Of course, like any good addict, one visit led to another... and led to another.  Now, I've got my kid hooked, too.  Yep - I'm mom of the year.  Seriously though, this location has great service and Paradise Bakery has some darn tasty food (despite being a chain - *gasp*).  I particularly like the chicken salad sandwich, fire-roasted tomato soup, and southwest caesar salad with added corn/pepper mixture.  Do NOT skip the cookies.  In fact, you should probably get a few for later... snickerdoodles are my personal fave, but you can't go wrong with any of them.

We have eaten breakfast at this spot more times than I can remember!    I love the quick-service concept.  It makes it easier to go with friends, deal with the child (especially if a quick escape is necessary), and just makes things a little bit more laid back.  Even though you order at the counter, their wait staff is still attentive to you and clears your plates as you finish.  So nice!  The egg-related artwork and quotes are amusing and the decor is simple, modern and fresh.  Favorite bites: Southwestern Burrito, Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, French Toast, Cheesy-Bacon Hashbrowns, "Dollar Cakes" (3 medium-sized pancakes for $1.89! A STEAL!).  Less-than-favorite bites: Costa Burrito (unpleasantly surprised that it didn't have eggs... just tons of potatoes inside WITH a side of potatoes... really?) and the Brizza... a tad bland.  A HUGE plus is Scramble's commitment to seeking out local products - way to go!  Bring a group of friends, or just yourself and your laptop to enjoy the free WiFi while you partake of a delicious meal and great service.  You'll be glad you did!

Postino, I love you.  I love absolutely everything about you.  My biggest concern is the anxiety I get when it comes time to order.  There are SO many things on the menu that I love, and I'm trying to maintain a girlish figure, so I can't order everything.  My absolute favorite lunch is the prosciutto/fig/brie sandwich on ciabatta with the mixed greens salad.  The fried shallots, pear, candied nuts, and grapes make it an unforgettable dish, and the salty-sweet combo in the sandwich is perfection.  Their lemonade is the best in town, and it is a steal when you factor in the free refills.  Of course, their wine list is extensive and amazing... but I just can't seem to give up my lemonade!   The service is always good.  Unobtrusive, knowledgeable, and friendly... plus a little hipster (but not TOO much).  It is always on my most-recommended list to friends and visitors.  Their consistency and quality are always spot-on.  If you haven't been, then get yourself there pronto!

I'm in love.  And, when you are in love, even the flaws just add to the perfection of a person (didn't you know that?).  So, even though there are some small "imperfections", Luci's is a definite 5-star place.  I LOVE THEM.  I am seriously considering setting up a cot in the store... then I could wake up and have the most delicious coffee (mocha, always) and fabulous service without going to the effort of leaving my house.  Hmm... think they'd let me?    Luci's has quickly become my most favorite neighborhood spot.  It is obviously helpful that it is super-close to my house... but there are plenty of other coffee places within a reasonable distance and no one comes close.  The entire concept is just genius - breakfast, lunch, dinner, bakery, cooking classes, cleaning products (all natural, of course), homeopathic remedies, locally sourced produce - my list could go on and on...   My most favorite thing about Luci's - their service.  I can't even begin to describe how awesome their baristas and chefs are - everyone is so sociable and friendly. Who wouldn't like to come here?  Not only are they good at making drinks and food - but they'll even recommend some good music for you to add to your itunes collection.  Love it!  Of course, their food/drinks are pretty awesome too - I adore the mochas - Iced, hot, peppermint, whatever-  it is always good.  The pomegranate citrus iced tea is so refreshing. I think I might be addicted.  Other top-notch items include muffins (blueberry and double chocolate-chip, especially), pasta bar, the Naughty Nurse and Dirty Doctor sandwich melts (and the names just make it more fun!), and the freakin' fabulous soup we had the other night... some kind of African spices?  Lentils, beef... amazing stuff.   We've also loved their burger, omelets, creme-brulee cupcake, etc.  They always have a number of gluten-free options, and they are constantly adding new ones - THANK YOU!  The imperfections (still not phasing me - because I LOVE them) - wait time for meals can be pretty long, which isn't a big deal if I'm staying and chatting, but occasionally I'm just ordering food to take home and don't have enough time to wait and wait.  Didn't love the peach-oatmeal muffin... meh.  See? Minor issues.  Nothing we can't get past, and still live happily ever after.

Finally!! A Gluten-free pizza crust worth eating!  The Husband and I usually have to order 2 separate pizzas, because I refuse to eat most gluten-free crusts... they are usually crumbly with little resemblance to a "real" crust.  But, at Picazzo's, we have found a happy compromise - a seriously delicious gluten-free option.  Wow!  We have tried the Meaty-Meaty (they aren't kidding - it is LOADED with all-natural, nitrate-free meats) and the Diavolo (heaven!!) pizzas.  The Italian Chopped Salad is delicious.  Keep in mind that the SMALL salad feeds 2 people easily... we watched a number of tables receive what looked like enough salad to feed a small country!  You'd probably need 8 people to finish the large salad, especially if you are also ordering a pizza.    Thanks for offering edible gluten-free items AND healthier meat options!

I really love this place!  It is just a smidge below a 5-star rating... and I'll be returning often, so I'll update if it makes the leap to super-5-stardom.    We have eaten at Gallo Blanco for breakfast and at least 4-5 dinners.  Husband mentioned that he thinks their menu is a bit limited, but I tend to disagree.  I think it is innovative with enough of a selection to keep it interesting.    Our meals have ranged from yummy to to-die-for deliciousness.  We have NEVER gotten anything less than great food.  However, there have been a few inconsistencies... my husband has ordered the chilaquiles on 4 occasions (creature of habit?) and has loved them each time... but they have been slightly different each time.  Maybe the cooking time is a little longer/shorter sometimes, but it can have a big effect on the end product (regardless, they were still fantastic, even if inconsistent).  Our favorite items have been ANY torta, the chilaquiles, and the guac.  I'm a huge fan of fruit in my guac (thanks to the introduction to pomegranate seeds in my guac at Barrio) - and the oranges were a delightful surprise.  The only thing I haven't loved is the honeydew agua fresca, and the horchata can be a bit hit-or-miss with flavor.  We have had nearly every waiter/waitress that works at Gallo Blanco over our many visits, and we have had NEARLY consistently good service.  There was just one visit that went a terrible I-need-to-call-your-manager-the-next-day way... and after said phone call was made (which, I promise, was a first for us!), all was made right.  We were so delighted that the management really heard our issue(s) and made us feel like coming back - which we have and will continue to do.   I really hope that this place has more staying power then it's predecessors... we will continue to frequent it, bring friends and out-of-towners, and recommend to all.

Coffee - 5 stars The Matador (a cinnamon mocha) is as good as it gets - iced or hot.  I find myself craving them... and nothing else will substitute.  What send it absolutely over the edge though, is the topping of whipped cream.  Oh, this isn't just any old spray can whipped cream - this is a marvelous concoction of vanilla, espresso, and heavy cream... that just screams to be allowed to top a perfect cup o' joe... though sometimes they are a little stingy with the portion.  The pastries are also delicious.  I like the ever-changing variety and lovely displays.  Service - 3 stars I am a sucker for the service at Luci's - where the baristas ask how your day is going, chat with you about what you are doing over the weekend, and generally try to engage you in any sort of conversation.  But, at Lola's, I've found the staff to be much quieter and reserved.  Maybe people like that?  But I definitely prefer a little more of a neighborhood-bar type feel.  They have always been nice enough... but I'd just like to see a little more smiling and chatting going on.  Thus, the 4-star rating.  Definitely a favorite coffee shop, and I will continue to return.

Just got back from our first visit to the Parlor.  We were celebrating my 4-year-old's birthday - what better way to celebrate than to introduce him to blue cheese, calamari, and cheesecake all in one night?!  He already knew exactly what he wanted to order, and our sweet waitress was super accommodating and offered to put in his order right away.  She clearly knows how to keep kids and parents happy.    We were surprised by the quality and quantity of the children's spaghetti with meat sauce.  It was fantastic and my son gobbled it up.  Soon after, our order of calamari and rock shrimp arrived.  The grilled lemon was a great addition, and the accompanying sauce was delicious!  Our entrees were the Yukon Gold pizza, sausage/radicchio pizza, and the evening's pasta special: Spring Pea ravioli with a garlic cream sauce and pancetta. Oh MY.  Husband nearly inhaled the sausage pizza, and the one slice I managed to steal from him was full of flavor.  It had sage and a very slight drizzle of balsamic - a great compliment to the other flavors of the pizza.  The Potato/Blue cheese/Pancetta pizza was also good, but not quite as spectacular as the first one.  We were thrilled with the ravioli.  It was light, bright, and spring-y - YUM!  My Mother-in-law couldn't get enough of the sauce, and used her pizza crust to sop up the remainder... no drop was wasted!  We ended with pistachio gelato and the cheesecake with pistachio crust and macerated strawberries on top.  The cheesecake was good and tasted homemade.  I liked the berries and the addition of balsamic.  I was not a huge fan of the pistachio crust however, especially after crunching down on a piece of shell.  All-in-all, the visit was a huge success.  The remodeled interior is lovely, and the inside-outside patio is beautiful.  Our service was spot on, and we really felt welcome (even with a 4-year-old in tow!).  The visit was topped off by our waitress bringing out dessert with a candle in it - obviously having heard our conversation about the boy's bday.  It was a really sweet touch.  We'll be back!!

Giving my business to a locally-run gem ALWAYS feels better than shopping at a chain... and knowing that I'm helping to "recycle/reuse" clothes at a much cheaper price is even better.  And, big props to them for supporting the community by collecting donations for St. Vincent de Paul.     I always love stopping in to PLRG.  The owner and staff are incredibly helpful and friendly... they have amazing customer service.  Not only can you find a ton of adorable clothes and shoes (and some not-so-adorable ones, as well...), but there are a number of locally-made items for sale.  Cute headbands and hair clips, jewelry, and even purses!  Best part?  Every time I stop in, it is like a whole new store... there is always something that I NEED!    Don't forget to sign up for their email list - they email out discounts like crazy!!

This is definitely not as good as Yogurtology, I'm afraid.    After an afternoon of shopping, I convinced the Husband to let us pop into Yogurtland to satisfy my sweet-tooth.  I was pretty put-off by the globs and drips of yogurt on every single dispenser.  It was a sloppy, goopy mess.  I really wanted to sample a couple of flavors - the chocolate coconut looked particularly yummy.  Unfortunately, there was absolutely no one present to help... and since the taster cups were no where to be seen, I just gave up and served myself a coconut and mango mix - always a safe combo.  When we walked up to the toppings, I couldn't believe what a mess it was - it looked like they had just been ransacked by a preschool class (and yet, there wasn't actually a child in sight).  To top it off, even the scale was smeared with someone else's yogurt.  ick.  When we finally got to eat our yogurt, it was just fine and tasty.  The mango was more creamy than Yogurtology's (but I actually prefer the less-creamy, more yogurt-y version).  The yogurt did not make up for the less-than-stellar first impression.  No need to return, when I have an immaculately clean, well-staffed yogurt shop so close to my house.

Judging from the other amazing reviews, it surely won't be long until this gem is packed at all times... Apparently it still hasn't been discovered by the majority of the city yet, which definitely made our Sunday night visit quicker.    As we arrived, I immediately fell in love with their door.  Their door? Yep. It is an awesome front door.  And the colors? Love.  Definitely a good start to our adventure.  The restaurant only had 2 tables filled - thank goodness there wasn't a wait, since we had the child in tow.   On the advice of other yelpers, we ordered two taco platters and a quesadilla.  Unfortunately, they were out of carne asada, my husband's first choice, but the lovely waitress's genuine apology made everything okay (seriously - people underestimate the power of a good apology!).  We ended up with Tinga chicken, veggie and cochinita tacos and a tinga chicken quesadilla.    While we waited for our food, we took our time trying many of the salsas at the salsa bar.  I was so happy that we picked a night that they featured the strawberry salsa.  YUM! Why has no one else thought of this deliciousness before??  Our dinner came out quickly and was perfect.  We absolutely loved every bite - the chicken and pork were tender and so flavorful.    Normally, I don't even bother to share what I ordered to drink... this place is the exception - HORCHATA.  I'm pretty sure that their horchata is taking steroids or something.... it is unnatuarally good.  I can't imagine going there and not indulging in this lovely rice milk - decked out with tons of fruit, pecans, and cinnamon.  Now, in all fairness, I'm about as white as a sheet of paper... so perhaps I've just never been exposed to amazing horchata before... but this seemed to be the ultimate.   Thanks for showing me the horchata light :)  I am looking forward to a return visit - very, very soon.  And if you haven't been there yet - get going!  Show them some love... I want to make sure they stay full and busy, so I can enjoy their deliciousness for many years :)

Oh. My. Goodness.  I realize that I just reviewed this little-slice-of-Heaven last week, but our latest visit deserves an update.    We brought my visiting mother-in-law to La Condesa, so we could share the Mexican-food love with her.  For the last two days, I've heard her on the phone to at least 3 different people, raving about the "amazing" Mexican food she had on Saturday.    On this visit, they had the Carne Asada (they were out last time).  My husband liked it, but actually thought the Tinga chicken was even better.  He swears there isn't a better chicken taco in town, and I think I'd have to agree.  My MIL had the chicken mole tacos and loved them.  She orders mole whenever she gets the chance, and rated it way up with Barrio's dish.  I was blown away by the deliciousness of the mahi-mahi burro.  Oh, goodness... I'm having a flashback of it's amazingness...  luscious chunks of fish, smokey bacon, mushrooms (which I normally pass on, but they were fantastic!), and their velvety cilantro-cream sauce.  Ahhhhh.... so good!    Another 5-star visit!

Pomo, how have I missed your existence for so long?  I hadn't noticed a single review until my friend, Kerry M, suggested we go visit you for my birthday dinner.  We made a reservation, which proved to be unnecessary for our early-bird arrival at 5:30.  Definitely should call ahead if you like to eat later, though.  It was really packed when we left.  The layout isn't my favorite.  Too many tables, too close together, and it got really noisy in there!  While I really do enjoy eavesdropping on conversations, this was a little much for me.  Luckily, the service was so fantastic, that I quickly got over my issues with the floorplan.  Our waiter had amazing Italian charm and seemed to read my mind the entire night - lemon for my water?  Why, yes, thank you!  Spicy, red-pepper olive oil?  I was JUST going to ask for that!  I love when waitstaffs are so good at anticipating needs.  On to the food:  I have never had traditional Neapolitan pizza before, but had done my requisite yelp research before our night out, so I knew to be prepared for a thin, and perhaps soft-in-the-center crust.  I think it was perfect.  I love the super-quick cooking time (5 minutes from ordering to delivery at our table!).  My choice, the Principe, was delish - simple, perfect tomato sauce topped with prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula and shaved parmesan.  Drizzled with the incredible olive oil, it was one of the better pizzas that I've ever enjoyed.  SO good in fact, that I finished the entire thing - and I may or may not have stopped at Zinburger for a milkshake on the way home.  I'll be avoiding my scale for a few days...  Looking forward to a return visit!

After bingeing on Pinkberry on my recent CA adventure, I was craving some tart and sweet frozen yogurt tonight.  Although Mojo is nearby, it isn't my favorite... so I relied on my trusty friend, Yelp, to find a new spot.  Yogurtology had great reviews, a pretty website, and was still open - so off I went!   As I drove up to the shop (9:15 on a Tuesday night), I was surprised by how many people were there.  A definite good sign!  Upon entering the sparkling clean shop, I was greeted by an incredibly sweet ... ummm... yogurtologist?  After mentioning that it was my first visit, she gave me the run-down on the place - price, toppings, flavors, etc.  It was like having my own personal yogurt shopper!  I settled on the red velvet with dark chocolate and white mini chips and a bowl of the tart to bring home for the Husband.  While I enjoyed both, I think the tart was my fave of the two.  Unfortunately, I have sampler's remorse, and wish I had tried every one of the dozen (I think) surely delicious flavors.  Ah, well... a return visit will be happening tomorrow, I'm sure!  4.25 stars - will surely be bumped up once I have a chance to try more flavors and toppings.

I think that 4 visits in 3 days says it all.  I love this place!   I'm super impressed that on each visit, the service really went above and beyond.  Yogurtology is schooling other yogurt shops (and many other businesses) on the simple skill of customer service.  They are friendly, attentive, and speedy, plus they keep that place spotless!    As far as the flavors go, I have become a huge fan of all things fruity.  While I can appreciate the heavier, more ice-cream-like flavors such as Red Velvet and Oatmeal Cookie, I definitely prefer the lighter, juicier options.   My favorites, thus far, are Maui Coconut, Orange Sorbet, Raspberry and Tart.  Mmmm, mmmm, mmmmmmmm.    Don't forget to get a punch card - 'cause if you become a crazy yogurt-obsessed lover, like me, you'll fill it up in no time!

Could I have actually found a reason to update my Yogurtology review for a 3rd time?  Oh, yes... I have!  The recently updated their register system and replaced the old-school stamp cards with a handy-dandy key-fob tracker.  Now, if you are ridiculously unorganized like me, you won't lose your frequent yogurt-shopper card.  YAY!  I'm pretty sure I have found a new favorite flavor.  Key Lime Pie.  Oh, my... How have I missed this on previous visits?  It is phenomenal!  If only it could be served side-by-side in yogurt-heaven-swirlyness with coconut... then, I could die happy.  Please, oh, please make this happen, dear yogurt gods.  Only one *tiny* tip - can we please get a facebook thing going?  A daily flavor update would be so easy, and would make it much easier for me to plan my visits.

I'm very glad that I gave Zinburger a second chance... they have certainly redeemed themselves.  On our first visit (with the 4-year-old, mind you), we were told the wait was 5-10 minutes... 25 minutes later, we were finally sat... with an incredibly annoyed child in tow.  We didn't have the greatest service (slow, forgotten items, etc), and I was shocked by the high price tag of a child's meal.  I really wish that they would put this on the menu... I definitely would have just shared my own burger with the kid, if I had realized!  HOWEVER - the Creme Brulee shake was just incredible.  The light dusting of salty goodness on top just sends it over the edge!    Since the shake was so unbelievable, I decided to give Zinburger another chance last night.  My sister and I were seated after a very short wait (appropriately estimated this time - improvement noted!), and our lovely waitress, Nikki, overheard me relaying my first experience to my sister.  Much to our surprise, our waitress had the manager, Danielle, come over and chat with us about our previous experience... and she graciously comp'd our divine milkshake.  Now, THIS is a way to change slightly irritated customers into raving fans.  I loved that they took the time to acknowledge my concerns and went to extra lengths to make sure I was satisfied.    I will definitely return - as soon as I need a "fix" of milkshakes and yummy burgers.

What a great concept!  Small plates with small drinks to pair with each one. Genius!   My husband and I had an unexpected date night, and Groupon led us to Centurion.  We were seated promptly, but the host seemed to be entirely lacking in personality.  Thank goodness our waiter (and a lovely waitress that helped us decide on a dessert) made up for it!   I quickly chose 5 different items for us to share, and was so disappointed when I found that they were out of the gnocchi.  I was quickly reassured that I would love the stuffed mushrooms as a replacement (despite the fact that I generally dislike mushrooms).  I went ahead with the waiter and owner/manager's suggestion, and they were right on!  Those mushrooms were fabulous!  MUST come back just for those!  In addition, we also ordered the mussels, a lovely blackberry salad, and a pasta dish.  All were tasty, but the mussels outshone the others.  We also ordered the brie en croute, and the host delivered a "well done" pastry to us.  When I inquired about how black the pastry was (the outer portions were totally burned), he said, "Is that going to be a problem?"  I thought it was strange that I actually had to tell him that no, I didn't want to eat burned pastry and had to ask directly for a new one.  Luckily, the second time was better.    The star of the show were the two desserts we ordered.  We had a fabulous salted caramel creation that I need to have again.  Delish!

You know it is good if I'm beginning to write my review, and I haven't even finished my little cup of heaven yet!  I have been stalking Torched Goodness on Twitter ever since reading incredibly complimentary reviews on Yelp.  Finally! A chance to sneak out to the Farmer's market to snag myself a creme brulee.  I came hoping for the coconut flavor, but alas - it is seasonal (sure to return in a couple of weeks, I was told).  Instead, I set my sights on the special flavor of the day - Maple with caramelized bacon on top.  Ahhhh.  I LOVE bacon!  The creme brulee had the perfect texture - smooth and silky with the most delicious burnt sugar crust.  And the bacon... oooohhhh man! Definitely get that on top!  Or on its own.  Either way - get it.

I'm totally digging Lucky Strike.  It is sleek, urban, and sexy  - strange for a bowling alley, but I can't think of a better way to describe the vibe there.  I almost felt weird bringing my kid with me to bowl, since the place felt so grown-up.  Luckily, we picked a kid-friendly time (Sunday morning), and the place was nearly empty.  We had fantastic service from everyone - the hostess, the guy who checked us in, and our waitress.  Our waitress was particularly awesome.  She didn't even bat an eye when our 4-year-old knocked over a glass of water.  I was happily surprised at how welcome they made us feel.  We sampled the Parmesan and Herb Fries, which were tasty, but I was wishing for more herbs and less cheese.  Maybe an interesting dipping sauce?  The menu looked interesting, especially compared to typical bowling alley food.  Looking forward to a return visit that includes a full meal!  The only downside is the price - $28 (not including food) for 3 of us to bowl one game, with shoe rental.  Maybe it is just my lack of recent bowling experience, but that seemed pretty high to me.  Luckily, the service and atmosphere made up the difference, and we won't hesitate to return.

I was seriously blown away at the sheer quantity of teas in this adorable local tea shop.  I could have spent hours there, smelling and tasting teas that I have never seen anywhere else.    The owner was incredibly helpful and assisted me in choosing a bundle of teas to give as Christmas gifts.  She even wrapped them up in cute little bags for me, and sent me off with a big cup of tea to-go. She spent a lot of time telling me about her products, and her knowledge was phenomenal - I guess that is why she owns a tea shop ;)  This is definitely my cup of tea!

Fuego does a taco right.  I've been to their other location and tasted a couple of different amazing tacos (carne and pernil), but on my trip to this location, I tried the Short Rib Barbacoa marinaded in pineapple, soy, chipotle and Dr. Pepper with an incredible pineapple habanero hot sauce.  It was the absolute star of our meal.  The starter of queso was really tasty too, and I loved the churros to end our meal.  Who doesn't love fried, sugary food to end their meal??    The place was a bit empty, so I'm hoping that business is going well enough for them to stick around.  Those tacos are stellar!

Bleh.   I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.  I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one!   Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.  I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit.

I just don't get Dunkin' Donuts.  Maybe it is because I've been spoiled by the deliciousness that is Rainbow Donuts - or maybe it is just because Dunkin's donuts are just total crap.    We happened to be in this area today, and got a few donuts to fulfill my sugar craving.  Their chocolate donuts are brown, but they don't actually taste like chocolate.  They were some of the blandest donuts I've ever eaten.  The pink-frosted sprinkled donuts were marginally better, but the apple fritter was a waste.    I am so glad I live by a REAL donut shop, so I don't have to resort to these low-quality, flavorless, tiny donuts on a regular basis.  If you are within 30 minutes of a Rainbow donuts, make the trip - you'll be glad you made the effort for fresh, flavorful treats.

Oh, Herb Box... I have been dreaming about you.  Your yogurt parfait is so delectable, that I have visions of swimming in giant pools of your yogurt, rolling around in your homemade granola, and getting drizzled with your orange-blossom honey.  Hmmm. On second thought, that seems a bit sticky.  Perhaps I'd better just return for another weekend brunch.  To be fair, the Herb Box was not our original destination.  We intended to go to another spot... and spied a never-ending line.  Who wants to wait for breakfast when they have a hungry 4-year-old in tow? Not me!  We ventured onwards, and stumbled upon the Herb Box.  No wait?!  On a Saturday morning at 10?  I was a little skeptical that there must be a reason for the slow morning, but hunger won out and we took our seats.    Our table ordered the amazing yogurt parfait, the BLT, and the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  Though they were out of their fresh squeezed oj (juicer malfunction?), they were thoughtful and grabbed a bottle of Naked juice from their market for us.  The BLT was something else... crispy pancetta, ricotta, fried egg, arugula, seriously delicious tomatoes, and a spicy aioli, all sandwiched between some of the freshest bread I've ever eaten.  It was just slightly toasted, and all kinds of delicious.  I love when restaurants take a generally boring sandwich and breathe new life into it.  Well done, Herb Box.    The outdoor patio is beautiful and perfect in this Spring weather, so make sure you venture over before it gets too hot out.

I was pleasantly surprised by my lunchtime visit to the Arrogant Butcher.  I am sometimes underwhelmed by Fox Concept restaurants, so I went in with fairly low expectations which were thankfully exceeded.  The service was helpful and very friendly.  She was great at suggesting items and drinks, and steered me towards the AMAZING lemonade/vodka drink with fresh muddled raspberries.  It was refreshing and delicious - so fresh!  The crushed ice was a really nice touch.  My lunch was the chicken club sandwich with fries.  Wow! Delicious!  Chicken, ham, bacon... really great flavor, and the bread just put the dish over the top.  I also enjoyed sampling my friend's fondue with pretzel bites.    It was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to a return visit.

An adorable spot, with retro candy and an old-fashioned (yet updated) vibe.  This is my go-to spot after a meal at Federal, Postino, or Windsor.  Good planning putting all of those places in close proximity to tasty ice cream!   Milkshakes are delicious, and I love the option to mix multiple flavors together to create to perfect taste.  Ice cream sandwiches are another must-try.  Your only option for seating is outdoors, but you can suck it up and be hot for a few minutes - you're eating ice cream after all!

We have passed this spot a million times, and decided to finally make a plan with friends to try it out, despite the fairly mediocre reviews.  Our friends were running late, so we grabbed a table in the bar area and ordered drinks.  The adult version of the cherry limeade was strong, but rather boring.  The Man had a Kiltlifter, which they have on tap, and you can never go wrong with that!  We decided to order the happy hour special bruschetta.  Fail.  It was absolutely heaped with tomatoes... bland, light pink, unappetizing tomatoes.  The bread was borderline burned.    When will I learn to trust in the power that is Yelp and not try restaurants whose reviews aren't already stellar?  They rarely surprise, and this spot was no different.   After our appetizer, we called our friends and had them meet us elsewhere for a much better meal... with the high prices charged at Betty's you can definitely find a much better meal at a more better price.  Heed those yelp reviews, people!

Overpriced. Terrible service.  Poorly designed/portioned rolls.  The only pluses I can think of are the location and the decor.  Lovely patio.    We stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered three rolls.  We requested all rolls to be made with soy paper instead of seaweed - a common request that has never been an issue at any other place.  Two rolls came out just fine... the third?  Under the soy paper was a whole second layer of seaweed.  What?  Okay, whatever... mistakes happen.  Unfortunately, our server was just dumb about it - "Oh... I didn't know you didn't want seaweed..."  Really?  You didn't know that is why we made sure we ordered all three rolls without it?  And then, even after having to wait another 15+ minutes for a newly prepared roll to come out... they didn't give any kind of discount for our trouble... oh no... they actually just re-rang the bill to make sure that they UPcharged us for that soy paper.  Fail.    We won't be back.

Oh, Rainbow Donuts... I love you.  Passionately, unabashedly LOVE you.  There isn't a better donut in town - chains like Dunkin Donuts don't come close.  Every single flavor is fried to perfection with the perfect amount of glaze.  Mmmmhmmm. Delish.

What a fabulously fun patio!  We had such a great time drinking, eating, and enjoying the people watching (a GOAT! Someone seriously brought their pet goat.), that it was hard to leave.  We shared the Green Chili Pork Tacos and I am OBSESSED with them.  Absolutely to die for.  They came with a slaw that really complemented the spice and gave them nice texture.  We also had the Chicken BBQ flatbread pizza.  Tasty, but the tacos remained the star of the meal.  The hummus was another good choice that our friends shared with us.  I had a couple of the 48th Street Fizz cocktails - they were strong and absolutely delicious.  This is a great place to hang out with friends and grab a bite to eat that is above your typical bar food fare.  It can be a bit of a scene, but that is part of the fun when it comes to people-watching, right?!

Consistently great service; always willing to adjust or substitute with no hesitation. Menu has gotten progressively stronger- the recent fish and chips special with fish chowder was incredible! We also loved the nightly special sausage and cheese dip- we ended up ordering a second one. Drink menu has some great options as well.  Glad to have another solid restaurant in our little town!

I'm having a seriously hand time remembering to stop saying "Lola's", but I'm working on it.    I've been there twice in the past week, since our move back to Phoenix... ahhh... it's good to be home.  First visit? I was actually a little underwhelmed.  No engagement from the baristas, and sadly discovered that they don't have dome lids for their iced drinks.  You probably don't see why this is a problem, except for I was balancing a baby and had to try and carry my Matador (no longer on the menu, but have them make it for you anyways!) to the car with no lid.  Eek!  Babies love to grab stuff, and whipped cream is no exception.  Luckily, I was a bit better informed for the second visit.  The customer service more than made up for the previous lackluster trip.  I ordered a couple of drinks, and asked for a little whipped cream in a different cup, so I could carry it all safely (still had a baby in tow).  I'm pretty sure that the barista is my new best friend - because he filled a whole cup up with their ah-MAY-zing espresso whipped cream for me.  Delish!    This spot has great seating, an awesome vibe, and usually friendly service.  Don't skip the whipped cream - but be prepared to suck it down if you need to put a lid on it!

After calling NINE different pharmacies to fill a prescription I needed rather promptly, I was really frustrated... on a whim, I pulled through this Walgreens' drive-through expecting them to also be unable to fill my prescription.  Low and behold, they actually had both of my prescriptions in stock!  My lucky day :)  The guy who helped me (Matthew?) was incredibly helpful and filled the prescription quickly.  So happy!

Although this little spot is only a half mile from my work, I had never noticed it until Groupon ran a special recently.  So glad I found it!  Since we had a groupon, we decided to order a few extra things to sample the menu.  We started with the chicken salad.  It was SO good.  Not too much dressing/mayo, and a nice fragrant hint of rosemary with sliced grapes.  It would have only been improved by having a huge hunk of bread on the side.  We shared a bowl of the cheddar bacon potato soup.  It was pretty tasty, but nearly caused 3rd degree burns - it was waaayyyy too hot!  We wished that it had been a little chunkier, and seemed like it would've worked even better as a cheese fondue dip!  Next up was the peppercorn burger, ordered with the addition of bacon and white cheddar, based on the advice of our server, Nicole.  She was an absolute rockstar - she had lots of suggestions and was a great help navigating the menu.  Her advice was spot on - the peppercorn burger was amazing!  Also on her advice, I sampled the Morning After drink (pear vodka, elderflower liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and champagne).  It was spectacular and very, very strong.  Perfection!   It was such a great experience, that we will surely return - with or without a groupon in hand!

It is no secret that I'm a huge fan of this restaurant group - Postino's, Windsor, and now Federal Pizza all have prominent spots on my date-night list.    I was lucky enough to be dining out with a birthday girl during their first week, so we snagged a reservation.  It was awesome to skip through the long wait and get straight to the good stuff.  Our server was just the right percentage hipster without being too much.  He was friendly and knowledgable, and we had a few good laughs with him throughout the night.    We ordered the burrata appetizer, which was delicious, but we needed more bread to go with it.  Don't be skimpy, Federal!  The date, ricotta, and arugula pizza was incredibly delicious, but was a tad heavy on the dates and needed more prosciutto.  I'm more of a fan of the fig spread that can be found at Postino's... the dates are just a bit too chewy and strong.  A swap out would be good!  Best part?  The absolutely divine homemade wine coolers.  The combination of flavors were perfect (we sampled them all between all of the girls at our table).  This alone would make me return!   Well done, Federal.... well done.

What an absolutely perfect and adorable collection of local gems!  The concept is fantastic - I love the "mini" versions of some of my favorite places.  My favorite?  The British Bicycle Company.   Those are the most insanely beautiful bikes that I have EVER seen.  And the owners of the shop are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  If you need a bike, don't go anywhere else!  I'm very excited to try out the restaurant and Royal Coffee in the future.  A return visit is in the very near future.

The service was okay, but this place was a total rip-off, even with the Yelp "deal" we purchased.  Meals were greatly overpriced and you are required to buy two plates of meat to use the BBQ (despite the fact that we ordered additional items).  The quality of the meat was lacking, and the garnishes that I tried were far from delicious.  The "fried" tofu was soggy and tasteless.  I was excited for my first venture into Korean BBQ - but my search will have to continue.  This meal - and hit to my wallet - was one I'll be trying to forget.

This hidden-away studio is definitely worth a visit.  The instructors are all wonderful, but I particularly enjoy Stephanie's Hot and Holy yoga on Friday nights.  It is a killer workout, challenging, and so inspirational.  I pass a number of other yoga studios on my drive to this one, and I will continue to do so.  They are wonderful!

Seriously unbelievable.  Not only was the service spectacular, but the food was outrageously delicious.  The chorus of ooos and ahhhs from our party every time a new dish was tasted was almost ridiculous, but it really was THAT good.  There was a sizable wait when we arrived, but we easily found a few seats at the bar.  Definitely a good choice!  Our service was spot on: the bartenders had amazing recommendations for drinks and tapas, and they took great care of us.    The highlights of our meal were the shrimp diablo, clams with chorizo, chicken tinge empanadas, white sangria, and the apple/manchago salad.  I've never been so impressed by a salad before!  We had a slight hiccup when a bug flew into my glass of sangria, but our bartender wasted no time and replaced our entire pitcher.  Above and beyond!    A wonderful restaurant, spectacular food, and top-notch service.  We will be back!

Decent, basic, but fairly boring menu.  There are much better options in Anthem.  The water tasted funny... which made me question the cleanliness of their ice machine. We told our server about out check-in discount (yay yelp!), but she neglected to take it off the bill. It seemed silly to wait around for the 90¢, so we just left without it.  Keep looking - explore the better options around!

So, let's be clear - I hate working out.  I don't like to break a sweat.  I don't like to run, or row, or lift weights.  However, it has recently come to my attention that after having children and passing 30 that I just might not be able to eat whatever I want and stay skinny forever.  I might actually have to work for it.  Lame.  Since OrangeTheory was opening up this brand spankin' new location right by my house, I figured that I would try it out.  While I can't exactly say that I "enjoyed" myself... I do think that they do a great job running the workouts.  Their trainers were upbeat and did a nice job adjusting my movements so I didn't hurt myself.  If you like gym-type workouts, but need the structure and push of a trainer to get you to the next level (or even just off the couch), definitely give them a go.

I was pleasantly surprised by this strip-center gem!   We don't have a ton of great non-chain food options in this area, but Yelp came to my rescue once again.  My husband and I both agreed that they did a nice job with the decor, helping you to forget that you were nestled in a large shopping center next to a movie theatre.   Unfortunately, we arrived too late for happy hour - we will have to aim earlier next time!  We ordered citrus chicken, kung-pao beef, and spicy fried rice.  The citrus chicken was delightful!  Crisp, with bright lemon flavor, and a fantastic choice.  They accidentally brought kung-pao chicken instead of beef, but it was still super tasty.  When they discovered their mistake (we had already eaten half of it), they insisted on making a brand new one for us.  We appreciated the effort, and were glad to have extra food to take home.  The spicy fried rice was yummy too - chiles and jalapeños made it just spicy enough to be interesting.   We will definitely return - and soon!

You know that if I'm willing to walk outside of my delightfully air-conditioned building in the middle of a scorching scorching summer day, it must be for a REALLY good reason.   I sadly forgot my lunch today, but my spirits rose pretty quickly when I remembered that a couple of food trucks were going to be pulling up to provide lunch options for our office complex.  We wandered over with high hopes of something good to eat.  So happy to say that we got what we came for!    I ordered a small (4oz) portion of the bacon mac and cheese.  Love that they bacon was layered throughout.  Great ratio!  It was creamy and rich - exactly what it should be.  My friends got the all-natural hot dog and the lamp lollipops.  I have never seen a hotdog look so dressed up!   Well worth the $7.95, plus it came with a side of chips.  She reported that the onions were the star of the show.  The friend who got the lamb enjoyed the meat, but didn't care for the sauce.   It takes a little bit of time to get your order, which I actually appreciate - it means they are making my food when I order it!  Thankful not to have heat-lamp warmed food.  Nice work, Grilled Addiction!

This is truly a foodie fusion heaven.  Everything from the decor to the personable and knowledgeable waitstaff to the meal was perfection.  Every person we interacted with shared insights on the food, was incredibly friendly, and made me feel right at home.  I wanted to ask our server (Stephanie, I think) to join us for dessert - I liked her that much!  For lunch, my mom and I shared two orders of tacos (chicken and fish).  Both were completely different, but bursting with unique flavor.  We also loved the chili-garlic noodles.  Perfect amount of heat.    We had a delicious chocolate bread pudding for dessert, which was a solid way to round out this fabulous meal.  Go here.  Soon.  You'll thank me.
