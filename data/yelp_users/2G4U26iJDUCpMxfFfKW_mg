Yay for local business! I'm always craving Italian food and the chains around here are not impressive. I have a new favorite.  For my first visit I stuck with a standard, Fettuccine Riazzi with Grilled Chicken.  Wonderful. The grilled chicken was a smidgen too peppery for my taste but the cheese sauce did a great job of making it all better. Next time I want to try something a little more adventuresome.  My only real problem was with the salad. It was smothered in dressing and inedible. In this day with everyone watching what they eat, isn't dressing on the side the norm? I'll have to remember to ask for it that way next time.  Maybe I visited on an off night (Tuesday) because the place was almost empty. Therefore the service was quick and attentive. I could tell by the conversations around me that most of the customers were regulars and the staff well-liked. That's always a good sign.  I'll be back.

Nice decor, huge wine selection if that's your thing. We went for an early (5-ish) dinner and were seated right away. Though I will add the place filled up shortly thereafter.  Staff has a "team" approach so everything moved efficiently. Staff maybe a bit over-soliticious as water glasses were refilled almost every time I took a drink and how's-your-meal? after every third bite.   But the food... the food was unbelievably delicious. Worth the tiny bit higher priced than Olive Garden type chains because it's so good. Had leftovers for brunch the next day and it was even better.   I will gladly return.

You all know KFC. You should be able to walk into a KFC and know how everything is going to taste. It's cookie-cutter food. That can be a comforting thing.  This has been my neighborhood KFC for about 5 years. Every time I've visited this shop, they're out of what I want. Every single time. My order is simple, two lousy pieces of original dark chicken. Their baseline chicken. The very chicken this chain was built upon. I've never been able to walk in to this store and get it. Ever.  The people are usually friendly, the dining area is usually clean, and the service is fairly quick. They just never seem to have their basic food available upon request.  So tonight I tried their new grilled version. Meh. Plus, the macaroni and cheese chain-wide has at some time changed. I'm not a fan of this new mac/cheese recipe.

I've been to this place a few times and I wish I lived closer. It's a great place to hang out, the service is excellent and what food I've tried is really good.  The bands I've heard there are good, too. There are a couple of pool tables and the patio area is misted so the summer heat won't be too bad.  We had our #evfn meetup here tonight and they arranged an area just for us. The server Katie managed everyone's separate order (as far as I know) without mistake, which almost never happens. Great job!  I'm sure we'll be back again.

I've been here multiple times and taken someone new each time. The only thing I've had is the Chicken Caesar Salad (why I only gave it 4 stars) but it's the best damned Caesar Salad I've ever had. I crave it. I ha d a CCS at a different place last night and it was... unsatisfying. Sauce had ruined CCS for me anywhere else.  Service? Smiling. Every time someone (manager?) has come around to our table to make sure we're happy. The place is clean and bright, and there's nice patio seating.   Someday I might try something else on the menu, but not anytime soon.

I visited this restaurant recently with a friend and we had an excellent brunch. I had the french toast with a side of bacon and I must say it's probably the best bacon I've had out in a long time.   We took advantage of the patio seating and it was very pleasant. The service moved along quickly without being pushy and all in all it was a very nice visit.  My only complain is the orange juice was warm. Really warm.

What a great place! I've been to Nine Fine Irishmen on previous Vegas trips and decided to have my birthday dinner there. I'd made reservations for our party for the outside area and when the temperature dropped and surprised everyone, they called me to ask if I wanted to be inside. Great!   We all fought over the appetizers of the beer and cheese dip and the battered and spicy sausages. Everyone loved what they ordered for dinner. I had the cider braised salmon (and I don't really like fish) and it was fantastic! I didn't hear any complaints around the table at all. They even surprised me with a bread pudding that looked marvelous - but nobody wanted any after their dinner.   We were upstairs overlooking the band floor so we got to enjoy a bit of that too. I wish I could have stayed longer.

We had a meeting in the area and the seven of us decided to hit Aunt Chilada's for a late lunch. It was convenient but that's about all.  The service was friendly and quick enough, but the selections were completely overpriced. I ended up requesting just an appetizer just to keep within my lunch budget.  The lemonade was bad. As in made with turned lemons and not sweet at all. And if they didn't make it, they need to clean the fountain machine or something.  I got a shredded beef quesadilla and it was so greasy I had to tip my plate to keep the remainder from swimming while I tried to eat. It tasted good once I squeezed out the drippings from each piece. I wasn't impressed.  But what annoyed me the most was although they automatically added a 20% tip onto every ticket, when the server brought back my change from a $20, she kept the extra 83 cents. Rounding up quite a bit there, eh? $2.73 tip for a crappy $9.50 appetizer is asking too much.  Next time someone suggests this place, I'll pass.

But the food was excellent!  Too bad the service was so poor.  I'd called earlier in the week (Sunday) and asked if the restaurant could handle a group of approximately 30 people from 6-8 on the following Friday.  I was assured they could and that I should verify the reservation by Wednesday.  They also suggested we choose from a shorter menu to expedite everything.  Fine.  The other organizer called to verify and was assured we were welcome.    I arrived early and found four round tops set aside for us, plus one end of  the bar.  We shoved the tables closer together hoping to get another one into that corner, but no such luck.  The single waiter struggled to take drink orders and then food orders as half our group ended up standing and shuffling around other patrons attempting to get to the restroom.  We did snag one more table but when we tried to get another one, a woman who I assumed was the manager asked those people to move - that table was reserved.  (Though is was not used until much later as we tried to check out)  A few of our group at the bar were at first told they couldn't order food, and another couldn't get water.    We realized they just couldn't hand us and tried to get our checks.  I had to pay my drink order and my food order separately.  Two people got their checks and the rest of us ended up standing in a line to pay our bills.  Nobody helped this one poor waiter at all.  I realize we have a large group but we did call more than once in advance and were assured there wouldn't be a problem.  When I mentioned to the manager that we were not please with the service she informed me that it was our fault, and that she'd warned us they were overbooked.  Gee, I don't remember any conversation that went that way.  As far as I know, none of us had any complaints about the actual food though.  I heard many compliments and my meal was very good.  Its just that we were made to feel unwelcome, the service was very slow and the people at the bar seemed to have quite an attitude when our people tried to order anything but alcohol.  Don't say you can handle a large group and then drop the ball before we even get started.

I must have sat in the lucky section because we had a fairly attentive waiter throughout the night. It might have helped that one of the people in my section was apparently personal friends with the waiter.  I could see that he was busy so I was a little more patient than I usually am.   The problem I have is they knew we were coming. They'd chosen to host the after party for a major Tempe event and still didn't have enough staff. Many people waited a long time for service and some gave up completely.   I ordered one of their garlic pizzas and it was nice. A little much for my Little Caesars palate, but I managed to pick off what I think were green tomatoes and the rest was fine.    Our drinks and pizzas were discounted and I didn't have to wait long for my check as some people did.   So although my personal experience wasn't bad, as a group we were not pleased.

I've been to this bar a few times lately, and when a nearby restaurant failed our group tonight, I suggested Kirk's.  We were welcomed and quickly served.  Although I didn't eat, I have eaten there before and they have excellent burgers and fries.  The service was fast and friendly.  I must say the place is kind of run-down.  There are different levels, pool tables and karaoke after 9.  The worst part is the bathrooms.  The men's room reeked though the ladies was much cleaner.    If you don't look too closely and aren't too picky, Kirk's is a fun time.

You know you're having a good time when the bar you're in is crashing around you and you still don't want to leave.  I went back again last Friday night (this place is becoming a second home) for #evfn and karaoke. The karaoke host came in early just for our group and we were having so much fun that the flood behind the bar, the smoke from something burning somewhere and the closed patron bathrooms didn't slow us down.   I love this bar.

Our evfn (east valley friday nights) group landed at RT O'Sullivans last Friday evening and it was fantastic!  We'd arranged to have a separate area for our social group, so though the TVs were on they weren't so loud we couldn't hear each other speak.   The waitress (as far as I know) kept up with everyone's needs and the food was really good.    My only issue is they only have pear cider. I prefer a hard apple cider like Strongbow and there were no choices.  We were treated so well I'm sure we'll be back again.

I was at the same party as Dani C. Though they were called in advance AND the party person was there 30 minutes early, they wouldn't seat anyone until most of the group arrived. We had to take one table and hover around waiting for another. Then we waited so long for service one family had to leave. 90 minutes after I arrived someone finally took my dinner order.  I've been here before and pastys just aren't my thing. Haven't found one I liked so I tried their chicken caesar salad instead. It was a large serving but mediocre.   The only thing I like about this place is the Strongbow on tap. Many of my friends love it so I'll end up going back but it's not someplace I'd chose on my own.

I'm not a beer drinker so I can't attest to those (though other people reviewing here certainly have a low opinion) but they do have hard apple cider on tap. That works for me. I've been to Dave's a few times lately. There are often events at Studio 5C upstairs and Dave's is convenient.   I will say the food I've tried before was not memorable. I do remember eating there, but it wasn't bad enough to complain about or good enough to remember... until tonight. I ordered the Mac n Cheese and I think it's the best Mac n Cheese I've had anywhere. I ate until I couldn't eat anymore and enjoyed every bite. A variety of cheeses and baked to deliciousness.  I sat on the north patio - away from the bar. The server was attentive and friendly right up til it was time for her to go off duty and she lost enthusiasm/motivation but eventually came back for the check business. I had a friend join me halfway through my meal and she was right on top of that too, until we were done. Oh well.   I can't wait until tomorrow night. There's another event upstairs so I have an excuse for a great dinner before going up. Can you overdose on Mac n Cheese?

I hate hate HATE going to the laundry but I've moved to an apartment that doesn't have facilities. Or rather the crap equipment it does have isn't worth trying.  I love EcoLaundry. Period. It's almost painless to go do laundry now. It's always clean, well-lit and staffed. I've only seen one machine down and the repairman came while I was there. Plenty of space, the machine sizes range from regular top-loading singles to front loaders that hold 6. Plus there's plenty of rolling carts and work spaces for everyone. Even the bathrooms are clean.  There's multiple TVs for entertainment if you don't bring your laptop to use the free wi-fi (and power plugs along the back wall).

Before I start let me say I don't drink beer. I went with a group so my review might be useless to you beer fans. Does it help that those in my group seemed to love it?   Comfortable seating? Yes. Regular tables, high-tops, and couch seating. Clean bathrooms? Yes.  Soft drinks for non-beer drinkers? Yes, and mead. Who has mead? Food? Hmmm, microwave hot dogs and nachos. But there's a popcorn machine in the corner plus they encourage you to have food delivered and even have a variety of menus available. Service? Great. Parking? PLENTY, which is what this place has BIG TIME over Four Peaks.

Went looking for real ice cream the other day and ended up here. While it was an interesting science example for the kids I wasn't impressed by the flavor of the ice cream. It was okay, just nothing special. My chocolate tasted exactly like when I mix Hershey's Syrup with vanilla ice cream at home, and the "scoops" they use for mixing in the adds was pathetic. For the price I expected better.  I won't be back.

When I contacted my insurance company's online reporting site, you could choose your windshield service, but they recommended Safelite. I've heard good things about them so click!  Their website is clean and easy to use. I could chose between bringing my car in to their local office or having someone come to me and being a lazy person, I clicked the second option and scheduled an appointment for the next day, a little chagrined about the 12-6 time slot. Within seconds I received a confirmation email, followed shortly thereafter by an email with all of the specific information including a bio on the specific technician.   The next day I expected to wait all afternoon, but the technician arrived right at 12, in fact a few minutes early. He was polite, friendly and explained everything he was doing to my curious granddaughter. He worked efficiently and even vacuumed up his non-mess afterwards!   It's a shame how we've become so accustomed to mediocre customer service that this company doing everything right is such a surprise. Their online presence is just right, their personal service is just right, and I'd recommend Safelite anywhere anytime.

First visit last night and I'll be back.   Our #evfn group had been invited to meet here this week, and there was a whole room set aside just for us. Service people Brandon and Ashley were cheerful and hopping the whole time. We tend to migrate/socialize table to table and they did an excellent job keeping up with the movement.  I had the chicken pie and a generous side salad and couldn't finish it all. And although they didn't carry my usual Strongbow, the Blackthorn cider was excellent.   I expect this stop to become a regular.

I've wondered about this place so my son and I took the opportunity to lunch there today. The decor is interesting, fair booths and decorations. The bartender was friendly, fast and responsive. Loved the roasting pig right there in the middle of the restaurant. My son ordered three different sliders, an order of wings, and a rib/fries order that came with two ribs. Our goal was to try as much variety as we could. I had a ginormous baked potato. Though the beef and chicken sliders were okay and he liked the full-sized wings we were blown away by the ribs. He kept saying "hands down, these are the best ribs I've ever had" and I tend to agree. The baked potato was good and filling - though not as good as the Texas Roadhouse across the lot. We're soooo going back soon. I walked out with a huge bag of cotton candy too!
