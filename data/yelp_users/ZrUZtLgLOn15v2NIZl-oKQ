I really wanted Asian food for lunch and to get out of the office on foot. Lucky for me, The Blue Fin met both requirements. (Sorry, I do not consider Pei Wei Asian food) I had heard about this place and always wondered about the dinky place with the blue awning.   First off, I was impressed for a mom-and-pop place with a drive-thru window, it was pretty immaculate. I noticed while sitting down to wait for my order, there wasn't a crumb on any empty table. The woman behind the counter was friendly and seemed to know a lot of the people coming through.   As for the food, I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted my chicken teriyaki vegetable bowl with brown rice. The chicken wasn't drenched in an overly sweet sauce like a lot of Japanese places. It had this smoky flavor like it had been on the grill, not something I'm used to with teriyaki. I certainly didn't mind it. Also, the cabbage, carrots, etc. had some flavor to them and they didn't taste like they had been overcooked or terribly greasy like at a Panda Express. I felt full afterward, but not in a gross "I ate too many onion rings" kind of way. The bowl cost about $6.50 which I consider reasonable. The place also has a watercooler where you are free to fill 'er up. When the cashier wasn't busy, she came around and grabbed my cup to refill it for me. Nice touch.   Now, I gave it four stars not because I'd call it a four-star restaurant but for what it offers considering it's "fast food" and for the good manners. I'll definitely come again. I could see meeting someone there for lunch or hogging a table just to read a book in between noshing on teriyaki.

TGI Friday's. Chili's. Applebee's. Cooper's Town. These restaurants/sports bars seem to come out of the same factory. I was really hoping Cooper's Town would be different food-wise. But the menu looked terribly typical of what you'd find in any ol' diner. I had the vegetarian quesadilla out of hunger and everything else looked terribly deep-fried. It was decent but made with regular cheddar or American cheese--so definitely not special. A person in my group had a Vodka gimlet that he said was all Vodka. The waitresses with eye make-up and other thematic elements of the restaurant didn't do enough to disguise the fact that this place is nothing short of mediocre. Maybe I'll upgrade if I ever go back and try something else on the menu and like it.

There are only two reasons I usually go to Gourmet House of Hong Kong--I need cheap, fast Chinese Food that's not packaged in a panda logo and I want a place where actual Chinese  people are behind the counter. The food isn't bad. It's what you'd expect in a Cantonese style place. But whatever I order seems boring and uninspired. Last time I had chicken and vegetables (really weren't many veggies) and a side of fried rice. I was disappointed that it was just white rice with bits of egg. I thought there would at least be some onion or scallion. And the rice still tasted more steamed than fried. I think they are playing loosely with the definition of fried rice. Anyway, I was glad last year that they fixed up the decor. The peeling paint on the outside did not do much to whet the appetite.

After years of being vacant, it's nice to see the Welcome Diner property revived. I'm impressed by the caliber of the menu that Michael has put together. And I love how there is Southern and Cajun style food. But even I couldn't have imagined something like the Holy Puerco--cheddar grit cake with cracklins and pulled pork. I also like the kale sandwich with the fried avocado. If you're getting the avocado, split it with a friend. Five pieces of that is a lot, in my opinion.  The biscuits are really unique. You can taste a difference from theirs and what you may get at another restaurant. The biscuit sandwich with the fried chicken and honey will hit just the right spot. I also like the biscuit with goat cheese and jam. And we can't forget about the peanut butter + bacon burger with fries. You may get some clogged arteries from sampling everything but it may just be worth it. I urge people to try this place. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Guy Fieri parachutes in.   I ended up writing about this place for an article on restaurants worth highlighting in Phoenix. Besides the food, I think this has a terrific location to build on being the "Cheers" of the Garfield neighborhood. The patio is really inviting and you can watch residents coming and going since it's in a residential area. It is quite hipster-dominated but that's just what a lot of Garfield and the Roosevelt Row area are. Hopefully there will be people to welcome this place for a long time to come.

So, for more than a year, I drove by this place on my way to work but never checked it out. I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced.   I have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful. I would definitely consider it if in the mood for something casual but not carbon-copy fast food.

When you are in the mood for a piping hot bowl of something savory and brothy, this is the place to go. Their soba and udon bowls are very nourishing and the soup isn't too salty. It's a great casual eats place and the menu has an "Italian" side if you have friends who are in a non-Asian food mood. Also, they bring a bread basket that has anything from warm rolls to banana bread. The price is reasonable for the amount of food. You know it must be good if you see three generations of a Japanese family at one table.

Why did I agree to go here? BLAAAAAAH! Even for fast casual Japanese food, it sucked. I got the low-carb (no rice) teriyaki salmon bowl. The vegetables _ a mix of cabbage, broccoli and carrots _ had no flavor whatsoever. It was like hospital cafeteria veggies. Ever hear of salt or using a flavored broth? The sauce on the salmon was OK but once you eat off the top layer, no flavor inside at all. It was not worth $6.62 or whatever the price. I rarely go so far as to say "Oh I could have cooked better at home" but in this case, it's true. One of the worse meals I can remember having. And their shiu mai dumplings obviously frozen and then cooked because a) way too labor-intensive otherwise and b) that had more flavor. How can it be next door to Cherry Blossom Noodle? I need a good meal to counteract this.

This place is just a few blocks down the street from me. Yet, in three years, I've only eaten four times. Perhaps it's because whenever I go, I see more people in their 50s and up so I don't think of it as a place where urban hipsters hang out. But I have to say, it seems to grow on me every time I eat there. The most recent trip was for Mother's Day brunch. After looking at various Phoenix eateries' menus to decide where to take my mom, I knew the Grille was it. Their brunch menu is quite a few steps above and for the prices, a great culinary investment. I had the griddled corn cakes (mmmm....) and you get a choice of meat. So I had diced smoked ham hidden in between them. It came with black beans and cheese, potatoes and maple syrup. Mom had short rib with a poached, breaded egg on top and a tangy red onion relish. The egg was a gem and the breading wasn't incredibly greasy. To top it off, they were giving moms a carnation flower. Nice touch. As for dinner, I highly recommend the pot roast. And I don't know anywhere else that serves up their quinoa and goat cheese cakes (what a yummy combo). And they do try to buy locally when they can. It's a great restaurant in a location that's never too packed with traffic. And the staff has always been courteous. It's really becoming one of my favorite go-to places. I'm surprised it's not plugged more in local dining guides.

I just have to add that the owners here really know the definition of good customer service. A month ago, I took out-of-town guests for Sunday brunch. Part of the reason I chose City Grille was because they had a promotion where you could get a free appetizer for checking in on a Smart phone. All you had to do was show your server. Well, my server, no matter how nicely I approached the matter, kept insisting that deal was only for people who brought a print-out of an email--even after I showed her on my phone what their own restaurant's Facebook page stated! She just shrugged and said "Well nobody explained it to me." I don't fault her if nobody told her. But I do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like, "I don't know anything about that but let me go check with a manager" after I showed proof. It wasn't even the appetizer but the principle of the matter.  I left a comment on the restaurant's Facebook page--very diplomatic, not with any self-entitled overtones. Their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened. Less than two days later, he wrote me, with the owner copied in, apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two!   This update is not to say "Woohoo! I got a free meal." It's just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it. It also sounds like because of me, they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that. And when I did go back for my free meal, that same server was there, lol. Luckily I had another server who was a lot warmer and approachable.

A year ago, when I was training for my first half-marathon, the PF Chang's one, this was my go-to place. Yes, it helped that they live just a 5-minute drive away from me, but everyone was really nice. I never got the sense that anyone was trying to talk me into spending more money. Part of that attitude probably has to do with the fact that they don't get paid for commission. But unlike a Foot Locker or some other mall store, the employees look like they actually run themselves. And they are incredibly patient. I'm bummed that the brand of shoes that works best for me, they don't sell. But they still help me whenever I come in and I buy all my other things from them like socks, Gu, etc.   The people were pretty supportive in trying to give me advice last year when I had very bad shin splints and I wasn't there to buy anything. One salesman adjusted my shoes for me by putting the insoles of my old pair inside for extra cushioning. It seemed to do the trick. It's definitely a place where you are rarely steered wrong.

I went here on Christmas Eve for lunch because I was always curious about it. Plus, the Chinese food choices in central Phoenix are pretty sparse. I would actually give this place more like 2-1/2 stars. I liked the tofu and pork clay pot we ordered. But the pork and kabocha squash dish was waaaay too salty. I feel like it was a spice, not MSG, that was the culprit. Either way, I had to scarf down a lot of water every time I ate some. We also had fried green beans with XO sauce, which is pretty simple to make. I know they have a buffet too and judging by what I saw during my stroll, the food seemed like nothing special. I did crack up at the using a tortilla container for the steamed rice.   I could see myself going here if I was really craving Chinese food for dinner or lunch. But I'd get it to go rather than eat it there. The inside is the usual old-school Chinese restaurant decor with booths and tables. As someone from the Bay Area and who grew up in a Chinese household, I could definitely say I've had better. I know the owner is supposedly a chef with 30 years experience so who knows, maybe I went during an off day.

I don't get out to Chandler much. But a friend's bridal shower ended up being held here. From the food to the service, everything could not have gone smoother. I heard they had recently remodeled the place. Well...bravo! Everything is tastefully decorated. Looks like a great place to get your happy hour on. There was a beaded curtain that sort of separates the bar area from the dining area. But it's a metallic bead curtain so not at all hippie-like. I can't believe a place like this is inside a strip mall with a Safeway.  The theme of the shower was wine and cocktails. The bartender--the owner's daughter--was super hospitable and personable. For our party, she demonstrated how to make four different cocktails. And the owner even went to the trouble of printing out the cocktail recipes on specially decorated paper. The owner is a lovely woman with a lovely personality. The owner is actually good friend's with the bride's mom. So, I don't know if the restaurant would do that for any party. But judging by how nice she was, I'm sure they would do something if asked and offered reasonable payment. And everyone was raving about the cocktails which were truly very good. My favorite was a chocolate martini. The bartender was skilled at taste as well as presentation.   For the food, we had a yummy cheese plate which included a parmesan cheese with honey for dipping, a truffle flavored cheese and another cheese that came with a pesto dip. We also had some scrumptious stuffed mushrooms. And for pizza, we went with the pesto and Mediterranean (sun dried tomatoes, chicken and feta cheese). The pizzas were thin crust and piping hot. And the cheese in my opinion was melted to the right consistency. It took all my power not to shove down more pieces when not everybody had gotten some yet.   I was happy with the food and level of service. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I only wished I lived closer so I could visit Pesto's on a week day.

A newly discovered gem hiding in the crevice of Northwest Phoenix. I had no idea there was a Bosnian presence here! As many things in Phoenix, this restaurant buried in a strip mall. Judging by the outside, I thought it was going to look like a hole in the wall. But the interior is like an Eastern European slice of Disney's It's a Small World ride. There are cute little faux windows and doors like you'd see in a Swiss village. It's very classy looking. When I was there, they had real roses on the tables (but I think that was because of a private party coming in later). It feels like a family restaurant too with actual stocky Bosnian men coming in to chat and eat.  I had the Bosnian soup (chicken &  vegetable) which was like split pea soup. The real awesomeness is anything involving their bread. My friend and I split a ground beef patty sandwich, a spinach pita and a Bosnian sausage sandwich. The meat had amazing flavor. The pita was a flaky, buttery bread. The beef and sausage sandwich was made with a bread akin to ciabatta. Apparently the person who oversees the kitchen makes all the bread herself. The bread is really the crowning jewel. Our waitress was pretty nice though she kind of rushed us near the end because of the private party. She wasn't rude but it was a little off-putting. Still, I plan to come back here next time I've had a good exercise day and I feel I've earned my carbs.

OK, I actually ate here back in October and meant to write a review soon after that. Better late than never!   This place is one of the few places at the Scottsdale waterfront area that impresses me. I think it's a gem above the Pink Taco, PF Chang-izing down there. The Stetson salad was refreshing and delectable. I was impressed by the "air dried" corn and the dressing didn't taste like run of the mill Caesar. Also had buffalo carpaccio for an appetizer which I hadn't had before. It was thin and flavorful. I like overall how the menu had atypical fare. I had the special, pork loin with a corn-green chili waffle. The waffle's texture was perfect--crispy outside and moist inside.  Couldn't leave without trying the bacon chocolate chip cookies. Very filling and the bacon bits are really tiny and subtle.   This place is good for taking a small group of family members or friends as well as date night. My mom and I had a table by the window so we could watch people walk by. Also good in that there are plenty of places to walk off the meal after! And even though it's in Snottsdale, the service was friendly and pretentious-free.

I had sworn off Ethiopian food after not liking the bread at my first Ethiopian restaurant. This place has reversed my view. I just ate here for a second time in a week. I have had the beef and chicken stew. I love how tender the meat is and the spices they use. I also like how they prepare their collard greens. Their homemade cheese was a pleasant surprise--not as salty as I expected. I was happily surprised by the bread. I was expecting something with the texture of a sponge or carpet--not that I know what either tastes like. Their bread is slightly sponge-y but closer to crepe wraps. The ladies that work the front are perfectly nice. It's funny to see a mom and pop place like this next to a Papa John's Pizza. I am now a fan of Ethiopian food.

If not THE, then one of the best chicken shwarma dishes I've had. Just the right degree of succulent and tender. And the garlic, yogurt sauce that comes with it is almost like crack. The jasmine rice was perfect in its softness and saltiness. Taboule was good and the pita was mmm..mmmm...good. Hummus was awesome too. Definitely going back to work my way down the menu. My friend who recommended it said she'd never had any bad item there. I totally believe her.

This is probably my top restaurant, Mexican and non-Mexican. Originally I wanted to go there to try the churros with goat's milk dessert. But naive me realized the entrees and guacamole are where it's at. Any time I have guests willing to shell out a bit more for a meal, I always stop here. There's usually a wait of about an hour, in that tiny restaurant, but it's worth it. Their homemade pomegranate seed guacamole (cranberries when pomengranate is off season) is a must. And I love how instead of chips and salsa on the tables, staff bring pieces of bread with this oiive tapenade. I have never had a bad thing here, from the tortas to their duck. If I could afford it, I'd eat there once a week 'til I conquered the entire menu. On weekends, they have live music which adds to the already casual, urban atmosphere. I once went to a cooking demo with chef/owner Silvana. That lady knows her stuff!

Another "cheers" to Richardson's. My cousin took me here for the first time two years ago. I've walked away satisfied. Portions are huge so I've been able to make two meals out of one usually. The green chile potato, or GCP as the kids call it, is really yummy. Last time I went, I had the relleno platter with roasted green chiles and a small house salad. The salad was nothing special and drenched in ranch dressing. But at least the waiter was very decent in telling me that he would get me a $4 one instead of the $7 which is what's on the menu. He didn't think it was fair to not warn me how much food that would be. But the beans were very flavorful and with the rice, it certainly didn't taste like the usual heaviness that comes from something out of like an El Torito's or Chevy's. And I think everyone should try the garlic toast platter. Richardson's does a good job of setting itself apart. And the decor is inviting with the copper tables and dimmed lighting. Good for a date or just to hang with a friend.

Happy to join the club of those who have hiked up the Summit Trail of Camelback. After all the warnings about how hard it is, I was pleasantly surprised that it was fun. And the view from the top is pretty spectacular. But there was a guy there taking pictures of people as well as the vista. I hope he wasn't trying to do some side business. Last time I checked, it's a mountain top there, not Sears Portraits.  Anyway, my body definitely is still feeling the effects of hiking up and down. But it's a good pain. The only hard part is when you have to traipse among all the rocks. You just need to be careful where you put your feet as you scale up or down. Definitely bring at least one 16 oz. bottle of water and a snack to have at the top so you have energy for the downward return. People going up have the right of way but really, I just do my best to yield to whoever. Not worth it. And people are generally nice.   My friend and I parked down McDonald on 56th Street. It took us less than 10 minutes to walk over to the trail. I don't understand why people can't do that instead of idling in their cars, wasting fuel just to wait for a space in a fairly small parking lot.  Glad I did this before summer arrives!

Ooh, I can help push Matt's to past 100 reviews!   Before, I only got stuff by takeout because the wait was just too much. This morning, decided to just suck it up. The fact that the downtown farmer's market is right across the street helps. I recommend signing the wait list before you're actually hungry and go check out all the local vendors.  I previously had the hog and chick with "off-the-bone ham." Mmmm....the ham is always flavorful and just the right amount of tender. I love how the toast is actually hunks of sourdough or wheat rolls with jam that's not a little Smuckers packet. Back to what I ate this trip, I finally had their Belgian style waffle. It was bordering on perfect--crispy in all the right places and steaming and soft inside. I love how they serve the syrup warm. The bacon was thick but not too dense. And the freshly squeezed orange juice of course complemented it all. Hard to believe that they don't add any sugar to the juice. I like how the hash browns aren't greasy like what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's.   The staff are quite friendly and make sure you've been attended to. The atmosphere in the little red brick house is a jovial neighborhood diner feel. Our wait was not quite half an hour but that's after we returned from the farmer's market to check on our wait. Time it all before you're actually starving and you'll be good.

Whenever I find myself in the vicinity of 32nd Street and Indian School near lunchtime, which is pretty much if I'm seeing my dentists nearby, I decide it's best to stop at Bertha's for grub. It's inevitable to undo the good cleaning I just got. Mind as well do it with a tasty Bertha's sandwich!  Last time, I had the asparagus and havarti sandwich. I couldn't sink my teeth into it until I got back to the office. So worth it. The bread was perfectly toasted. Not sure where they get their bread but it was nice and thick. The asparagus was cooked very tender, likely in olive oil. Pesto mayo was flavorful. I think the price of about $7 with a bag of chips and a mini cookie is reasonable for the quality. Just typing this I wish it were nearby now. I haven't tried any of their salads or baked goods. But I like how they offer mini cupcakes for 75 cents. I give Bertha's two thumbs up.

Ate here for the first time a week ago. Had the fried egg with applewood smoked bacon on top of a crispy puff pastry and grape tomatoes. It was nice and light; didn't feel bloated afterward like you would after IHOP. I love the European cottage decor and ambience. Eating inside and outside looks equally appealing. Also, besides regular juice and coffee, they have hibiscus tea. My only wish is that the portions were slightly heartier for the price. But everything tastes fresh. I definitely plan to go back. Great local fare.

I decided to revisit Sweet Pea during my lunch hour. I'd been there once two years ago. Luckily, the prices haven't changed. I wish they'd have more choices for lunch salad plates but pastries is more their specialty.   If you are feeling like a big hearty lunch, you should go somewhere else and come here for dessert. I wanted something lighter so their white bean artichoke spread with fresh vegetables was just right. The spread has a hummus texture but without the oil. The lemon and garlic give it a healthy zest. I thought the plate which also includes salad mix that looks like it might have come from one of those bags at the store should cost just a little bit less. But I realize this is a local business and they need to make money for the effort.  But the regular food isn't why I come. I knew I had to try their olive oil carrot cupcake with marscapone frosting. I'm officially a fan for that alone. The frosting, which I'm dying to try making myself, is seriously a whipped incarnation of heaven. It was just the right amount of sweet and the texture was like whip cream frosting. I prefer this for now on with carrot rather than cream cheese. The cake was moist and had walnuts and cinnamon.   I've had Sweet Pea's PB & J cookies and rosemary shortbread at local business events. All yummy. I definitely plan to go back again to sample some more confections.   The place also has a lot of character. Pictures of cakes are hanging everywhere. It's got a homey, down to earth feel with the simple chairs and tables and all the kitchen equipment out to see. I wish this place was a little more visible and not stuck behind the Maricopa County Jail. Oh well. Sweet Pea, which has some of the sweetest sweets.

After hearing about this place in the paper and from the chef/owner of Barrio Cafe as a savory, cheap eat, I finally gave it a try earlier this year and have been wanting to go back! I had half a regular torta with the tender slices of  beef (mmm...little slices of heaven), avocado,  that pork, all on a white roll. And there's no way I could finish a whole torta. So, from a budget standpoint, it's even more worth the money. Also tried one of their huge huarache, corn tortilla that was snowed on by queso fresco. Anyone who goes must have one of their fresh fruit juices. They have a wonderful variety and it's a nice kick with meaty, not-sweet menu. It's definitely one of those places where there are more natives than gringos, which is a good sign.

Had to wait almost 30 minutes on a Sunday morning and got only a counter seat at Over Easy. That's okay, it was worth it. A friend and I split a omelet with smoked salmon, asparagus and spinach and chose home fries. The omelet was tasty but a tad too salty. I'm not sure if it was the salmon or too much salt in the egg. The home fries were tasty but next time, I want to try the tater tots. We also split Reeses Pieces pancakes. At first, all I saw was a smattering of Reeses candies on top of three pancakes. I was like "That's it?" But I turned one pancake over and was relieved to see there were candies in the batter. I know that was the least healthiest thing I could have ordered, but no other restaurant offers M&Ms or chocolate chips in pancakes. The pancakes were just right, the thickness of each cake with a soft inside.   Love how they turned what was once a same-ol-same-ol fast food joint into a popular spot of home cooking. The staff seem friendly. While I was there, someone ordered the Big Easy of 12 eggs, 3/4 pound of bacon, home fries, etc. smothered in country gravy. That was one huge muthaf******. The whole staff came out to present it to the customer with the manager taking a picture, LOL. If one person finishes it in 30 min or less, it's free. I have no idea if they put a timer out there or what.  Anyway, looks like there's a wait no matter when you go on the weekend. At least they have a canopy with some benches near by. I'd go here again as long as the wait is under half an hour.

ShopDevious.com now has a special place in my heart. The owner, Anna Marie, is a lovely, lovely woman. Without hesitation, she allowed me to put on a bake sale for breast cancer charities during First Friday. She has made her mission to support for a cure for all kinds of cancers. She actually gives discounts on wigs for cancer patients. Anyway, I love how it has a vintage Haight & Ashbury feel. It doesn't feel like Grandma's attic. And I've never seen so many choices for fishnets and false eyelashes. And of course, she has all kinds of cool wigs.   The store does all kinds of events like open mic and they'll have a deejay during First Friday. It's on Grand Avenue which some people mistakenly think is really dangerous. Well, I can tell you during First Friday, there are so many people walking around, you feel perfectly safe. There's even a trolley that drops people off nearby. It's definitely in an area that has been revived somewhat.   I plan to go back as a customer and perhaps will update my review.

For some reason Ci Ci's has never made it to California which would explain why I'd never heard of it til I moved here. Went here last week with some friends away from our usual area a few blocks north on Indian School. Geez, what a difference a few blocks makes.   Don't get me wrong, I appreciated Ci Ci's "recession prices" of $3.99 for the buffet. That is hard to beat. But it's also the big draw for the crowd that was in there. No sign of any urban hipsters or young professionals. Quite a few mallrat-types or guys engaged in some sort of eating contest--I suppose they could have just been hungry. And I don't mean to sound harsh or judgmental, but it's depressing seeing that person who is not just eating by himself, but clearly overeating. Actually the overeating was also being done by a couple of groups of very obese people.   As for the food, the buffet I suppose was worth about $3.99. There are two salad choices. The bowl with the one I wanted, tossed with Italian dressing, was almost gone when I got there. It seemed like they never bothered to make a full bowl for the rest of the time they were open. The soup didn't look very appetizing. The pasta option was just elbow macaroni that looked like it had been tossed in canned tomato sauce. The pizza was fine. It didn't have any unique flavors. The combo I did like, surprisingly, was the mac and cheese pizza. No sauce, just cheese--orange the way it should be when dealing with macaroni. Figures I'd like the one choice that would make one's carb allowance skyrocket. I skipped dessert so no idea if their brownies and cinnamon rolls were any good.  The staff was nice though. The clerk politely explained the choices to us old-timers. And they will make a whole pizza if there's a combination you want. Still, I won't be in a big hurry to eat here anytime soon.

Went here for a second time. I do like how you come away feeling less guilty about eating out because their menu seems so health-conscious. I like their off-the-beaten-path drink menu. Honey and cucumber lemonade, who'd have thunk? Extremely refreshing. Looking forward to trying more drinks in the future.  Last time I was there, I had the shrimp dumplings, which were fine, and butternut squash ravioli. Really good but not as filling as I would've liked. This time, I munched on edamame dumplings for an appetizer. They mash them up really well. Not sure if everyone would like the paste-like texture but it was yummy to me. Had just a hint of spiciness and was wading in sesame-oil broth. I had a grilled sustainable salmon fillet on a piece of wheat bread with cilantro aioli and I went for the sweet potato hash. The hash is worth a trip here. It wasn't greasy. I like it loads better than home fried potatoes. May try making it on my own sometime.  Sitting inside is kind of neat because you can observe staff prepping some items on open islands. Staff has seemed perfectly nice so far. A friend said she got looks from some people when she went for how casual she dressed. I didn't get the sense today as one guy came in with a bulky backpack and someone else was in jeans. And nobody should be criticizing as the wait staff themselves are allowed to wear Keds or whatever sneaker wear. Anyway, I'd bring visitors or native friends here. Lunch for two with appetizer and a drink was about $40 before tip.

Although initially let down by how few vendors there were the first time I went, I'm a believer in Vincent's market for the wood-burning pizza oven. I've gone three times now. For me, there's nothing like going for a leisure run along the canal Saturday morning and hanging a right at 40th Street to get replenished at Vincent's. I think the $8 pizzas are the best pizza I've had so far in metro Phoenix, if not Arizona. There are so many choices--smoked salmon, regular pepperoni, avocado. The crust is thin and just the right amount of crunchy. My favorite so far, but probably one of the most fattening, is the tarte flambe--cream, bacon and fresh thyme. Licking my lips just writing that. I notice that when Vincent himself is operating the oven, he still makes time to chat and charm patrons. I also had a mini ratatouille tart which was excellent. All the vegetables were a nice texture and the crust was great, but  you could taste the butter in it. You can also get grilled half chicken plate with vegetables and potatoes for $5. A great deal. However, the later you go, the drier the chicken might be. I plan to go back and try paninis, paellas and some of their other delicacies.   The only thing is you must possess vulture-like reflexes to grab a table if you want to eat there. There are more crowds than tables and chairs.   The vendors that are there have some decent wares to peddle. I was excited to find a woman there who sells farm fresh eggs since the downtown farmer's market always runs out. Also, just picked up some really yummy, not overly sugary raspberry jam. Anyway, I recommend parking at the strip mall across the street.

I've passed this non descript place a number of times since it opened in November. Tired of patronizing Starbucks (why are there always at least two within a mile of each other?), I opted to give Dolce a try.   I will definitely come back because when it comes to a coffee shop, the vibe and interaction with the staff is so important. You want to feel it's okay to be a squatter for a few hours. The owner seems like a real down-to-earth, friendly guy. He told me how he was a property manager and started serving coffee and pastries out of is apartment(!). All I've tried so far is their medium chai latte. Whoa, does that have a kick! There must be cayenne pepper or something; it's definitely a sinus-clearer. I learned they make all their baked goods themselves including some HUGE cupcakes.   I like the skulls art and bright orange-yellow decor. There's a giant checkers set and couches and tables. Though I wonder if this place is making the "gayborhood" stretch beyond gay Denny's on 7th Street, hehe. I've been the only girl in here all day. And I keep overhearing conversations criticizing what girls are wearing in the music videos playing as well as the staff singing along to an old Paula Abdul song, hehe. But they have free Wi-fi and are actually open 24 hours on the weekends which is rare in Phoenix! It's good to know on the weekends, if I go out to dinner, there's a place I can hang out at later that night.

I have to show my love for Dolce and Caesar, the owner, again. I told him about an event I was having in November called CupcakeCamp. We were just chatting; I wasn't fishing for anything and he readily offered to donate coffee for the event. Now, that shows good business sense to really put yourself out in the community!  I hate seeing how little business he gets in the mornings compared to week nights and weekends. I really wish more people would pull over while going thru the Camelback Corridor. Besides really good coffee, the man knows how to make good breakfast burritos and sandwiches. Cesar is a hardworking, kind and dependable proprietor. I really hope more people stop by and give this place a chance. It's actually opened late too!

When I heard about Toast, I thought what a great niche idea. So, I went on a weekday morning. I know it's the same staff as Drip and they are super nice. I really approached this place wanting to like it. I have to say, the cons outweigh the pros. First of all, it's fortunate that I was not in a hurry. We waited at least 25 minutes for our order. And the few customers that were in the restaurant were already finished eating. We were waiting for French toast, the toast with mozzarella and roasted tomato and toast with fig jam and mascarpone cheese. Perhaps the wait was long because they were roasting tomatoes? If that's the case, there should be a tiny disclaimer. Secondly, the French toast, in my opinion, was not worth $8.50. The bread wasn't especially thick. You can get just as good for cheaper at Over Easy. I also think $3 for tea is a bit overpriced. Maybe they have to do that to make a profit for organic ingredients or special beverages. The tinier dining space I can live with. I think even a restaurant housed in a sardine can would fare well if people really feel the food is worthwhile. I wish Toast well but it's doubtful I'll be going back any time soon.

I couldn't put off my ravenous feelings anymore after leaving work the other night and pulled over at La Condesa. I had been meaning to try it for quite some time. So what if I was a party of one. Satiation is more important than social appearances. The place is in a mildly sketchy area next to a little market that sells pinatas and a few groceries. To me, this actually lended the place some street cred. Anyway, I like how the restaurant's interior has none of the feeling of a Baja Fresh or Chipotle yet the prices are pretty reasonable. The dining room doesn't look like it can fit too many people so I'm wondering what it's like on weekends. The bathrooms were reasonably clean and I got a kick out of the whole lucha libre motif in the bano for the chicas.   I had a pork mole burro with the mole made with chocolate and nuts. Muy sabrosos but the meat was a tad salty or too kicky, not sure if it was the tanginess or salt that had me asking for more water. But I think that is more a matter of personal taste buds, not the reflection on the cooking. I found the meat quite tender. And I felt like a wimp only being able to eat half the burro. Next time, I will probably do the two-taco deal. There was only one gal doing all the bills and service. She was quite nice.   But what will make me come back again is their awesome salsa buffet. It makes the salsa trays at chain restaurants look like plainer, less adventurous salsitas. I had the strawberry salsa (sweet yet salty), jicama, cilantro (my favorite but found if you have too much too soon, you'll feel lit) and peanut. It got to the point where I had to tell myself "no more chips" so I simply sucked the salsa off a chip like it was a spoon. Yup, it reduced me to that. Anyway, I do need to go back and get some more ideas of the food. But for now, I'm a fan.

This place is getting me to let go somewhat of my perception that Bell Road in Glendale is gastronomically uninspiring. When I think of Bell Road, especially the Glendale stretch, I think of nothing but chain restaurants and steakhouses. I don't know if Le Chalet is an emerging chain, but it's already unique in that they specialize in crepes. Hard to find of great quality in greater Phoenix.  My friends and I went on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded. Decor wise, there is a lot of charm. The chefs wear beret-style hats. The dining area, and even the restrooms, have a cobblestone motif. Reminds me a little bit of an old toy store inside Fantasyland at Disneyland though less cheesy (pardon the pun). All the napkins are even bound in cute little cow theme napkin rings. The servers all sport the suspenders one would see on traditional Swiss outfits.   The menu is a cheese-lover's dream. Instead of ordering off the appetizers section, we had a regular Swiss cheese fondue for an appetizer. Cheese was just the right degree of sharpness. They bring the little fondue and long forks to the table. You can adjust the heat. Wish I had warmed it up a little more after some time had passed. Every table gets a little sliced tartine (crispy cheese bread) to start as well. After all that cheese, we each had a crepe for an entree. The crepes were folded into perfect squares with crisp edges and the filling and sauce visible in the middle. Also comes with 1/4 cup of salad with a garlic-mustard vinegrette. I had a smoked salmon crepe with lemon and dill cream sauce. I really loved the crispy outside of it. I wish I had tried one of the more exotic crepes. Some you might not be able to finish in one meal because they are filled with ingredients like potatoes and bacon.   We split a salted butter caramel crepe for dessert. Heavenly. It's one big, almost paper thin triangle on top of caramel with more caramel drizzled all over. The caramel was a luscious diversion for the palate. It had some almonds that were over-toasted but not a big issue.   The staff was pleasant. Next time, I want to try La Potence--what they call "The Hanging Man." A chef wheels out a cart with pieces of filet mignon hanging on a cylinder with little hooks and flambes it tableside over rice pilaf. A chef was demonstrating it to someone as we were getting ready to leave. He was thoughtful in explaining to us as well what he was doing.   Can't believe I actually want to go back to that part of Bell Road but it's worth the trip. A great place for groups with its reasonable prices. There were people with their kids. But none of the kids were running around wild. Not surprising if the parents are  willing to do something like  fondue for dinner out with the children. Despite the name fondue, no pretension in the ambience. At the same time, it feels a little classier than say an Applebee's.

Writing a review because some of the negative ones had me laughing my ass off. For the people so bothered by the fact that the owners are not "vegan or even vegetarian," let it go! That hardly qualifies as "unethical." It's not like the awesome sister act behind Treehouse is using the equipment in their kitchen to make their treacherous carnivorous meals or they are eating BLTs as crumbled bacon falls into the cake batter. And as for the complaints about the price, $2.50 is beyond reasonable. As someone who has visited every bakery in central Phoenix at one time or another, their prices for the quality and the presentation are absolutely fair. And if you think their cupcakes can't match up to your own wonderful vegan baking skills, then you should...I don't know...go bake yourself!! And taking your review down a notch because you didn't realize they were vegan and you don't eat vegan, well I think that's more on you than them.  Now, on to what matters: the product itself. Treehouse Bakery has an awesome range of flavors and they made me fall in love with their churro cake. Two years ago, I ordered one for my birthday and they decorated it to fit my request to a tee. Angry Asian Girl cake, YES!! They bend over backwards to fulfill customers' orders and believe me, they have had some doozy of requests. They are more than qualified to run a bakery, vegan or not.  Cori and Amanda are also just genuinely awesome individuals who care about the community. They have helped me out more than once when I needed cupcakes for an event. If you become even a semi-regular, they make you feel like an old friend. The Grand Avenue and Phoenix in general should feel lucky that Treehouse is there and hope that it stays around for the next gajillion years.

My good friend Bacon (see review below) and his partner invited me to Sunday brunch. And going off of my first impression, I'm a fan of this place. I had one of their skillets--a poached egg, filet mignon, potatoes and shitake mushrooms. Filet. Mignon. Those words alone on a brunch menu is a rare occurrence. And I would not have thought to combine it with mushrooms I usually associate with stuff my Chinese mom cooked for us growing up. But the flavors really worked. The meat was just right, not fall-off-the-bone tender. The potatoes had flavor too. And it wasn't an insane portion. $10 for a meal that includes pieces of filet mignon--pretty good deal!   In such an intimate--but not totally cramped--space, you can easily strike up a conversation with the owner/chef, hostess and any other staff. All three could not have been nicer while we were there. Also, love their taste in furniture and can't wait 'til the weather improves and the cool patio will be available. Also, let's hope that liquor license comes through soon!

As a cupcake geek, I was pretty excited when I saw the beginning construction for this place earlier this year. So, I take no joy in expressing my disappointment with Cupcakes By Design.   The first time I went in there, I was really surprised by what I saw. For $3.50 per cupcake, I expected a little bit of creativity in the decoration or something. Instead, I found cupcakes that were about the size of what I bake at home with what amounted to a dollop of frosting. Yes, they obviously used a piping tip but there was no sense of fun or creativity in the decoration. And for $3.50, there should be a lot more frosting. I had their banana cupcake which was OK. It was the first time I had a banana cake that wasn't like banana bread but rather cake with some banana flavoring--though I believe they used fresh bananas. The frosting was...meh. Whenever I go to another city, I always stop at a bakery. And it's rare that I've seen any place charge $3.50 for the size that this place offers. I just can't justify it in this case.  I was also a little soured when I stopped in their another time to talk to the owner about an event I was having. I wasn't even asking for any donations--only if they happened to have day-old cupcakes they wanted to get rid of. If not, no big deal. I was going to go on and explain about this community event I was putting on called CupcakeCamp and maybe ask someone to come judge and I even had a little flyer, but the owner totally shut me down before I could go further. She wasn't rude by any means. But she certainly put the curt in courteous. I understand having trepidation with a new business and it's fine to say no to me. But to not even hear me out first, frankly, kind of sucked. And if you're a new business, you'd think one would want to hear about an opportunity to freely promote to a big crowd. I probably won't be swinging by here again until I feel like all bad cupcake karma has been vanquished.

A restaurant whose mantra is "Come Together." How bad can it be? The question for this place is how far from bad is it? I'm a fan now. What's more is I think I could be friends with the owner. Anyone who puts up pictures of Audrey Hepburn and Julia Child, two icons I've always respected, in the ladies' rooms is good peoples. The vibe here is very warm and welcoming. One of the owners greeted me at the door with "Get yourself out of the cold!" I liked how even though he was wearing a plaid shirt and casual pants, he wasn't taking away from the upscale vibe. The only thing he took away was pretentiousness.  Love the not too daunting menu. My gal pals and I split the country pate--made with ground chicken. It was very good but I liked the other things on the plate--cheese, pickles, sundried tomato and fried capers. Their brussel sprouts appetizer was very yummy. The sprouts were cooked just right.   I had the beef bourguignon shepherd's pie. Perfect with the nippy weather. Mashed potatoes of course were piped on top. You could taste some wine the sauce which really makes a difference--in a good way. Meat was tender enough. One friend had the chicken and dumplings which had a nice flavor. I'd go back to try that. My other friend had tender short rib with a red wine reduction. It was excellent--texture, taste of the reduction. Hope to go back to try that as my entree. My friend got a side of mac n'cheese with pancetta/bacon. It was decent. They don't use very sharp cheese for those that prefer cheddar. It wasn't quite as good as Bliss/Rebar mac n'cheese.   As for dessert, we had that picked out before the appetizers. Chocolate-dipped bacon 'smores were the crowning touch. Marshmallows were toasty and gooey. It came with some whipped peanut butter that was heaven with the graham cracker and marshmallow. The bacon and chocolate was really good together. Though the bacon was a little too salty. There were a few bites where I somehow tasted more bacon than chocolate and the saltiness was a bit overpowering. But everything together was just scrumptious. A woman at a table nearby was staring in awe. We told her it's a must to get.   Definitely happy to expand my restaurant radar. I feel like the last few times I've gone to eat, it's always been a FOX restaurant or something in the Ticoz-Fez-Switch trifecta. Glad to branch out!

Finally, a Southeast Asian food pulse around CenPho. When I first moved here, one of the things I noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to Asian cuisine. So nice to see something a little less common like Cambodian food get represented.   The spring rolls are a must. For $2, you get a very heavily stuffed roll of rice paper touting chicken, shrimp, cilantro, carrots, etc. The beef salad is also a winner. The seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul. The sandwiches with the pork pate are a great lunch choice. One day, I got one plus a roll to go--all under $6. Of the desserts, everyone should try the sweet and salty corn at least once. The tapioca is my favorite. Light and warm.   The best part about eating here is knowing that your money is going toward a very genuine and kind Cambodian family. I have spoken with the chef/owner's son every time I go in. A real sweet guy who will demonstrate how to play the xylophone-esque instrument that is the centerpiece of the main dining room. Speaking of, I love all the touches of decor i.e. travel books on Cambodia at every table.   I really, really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in Phoenix that had really great things to offer. I've been disturbed by the lack of customers I've seen a few times. I want this restaurant to really succeed. I don't want the lines out the door (otherwise I can't get in. ;P) but I want to see a steady stream of patrons. This place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond. It doesn't fit a cookie-cutter mold and it's got a fantastic bill of fare to show off.

Sorry to say, that I am not a big fan. Maybe part of it is having had much more sublime ice cream at places like Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco where the sometimes long wait is worth it. Or maybe because at a Baskin Robbins, I've never chewed on ice crystals while circumventing an ice cream scoop. I was out bike riding and happened upon what turned out to be Churn's opening day. The women behind the counter were extremely polite and patient as I sampled three flavors. I finally settled on blueberry. I was pretty surprised when I was handed my cup and the "scoop" looked more like 3/4 of a kiddie scoop. For $3?? It barely filled the cup half-way.   Well, last weekend, a couple of friends and I had dinner at Windsor next door which we found quite yummy. My friends hadn't tried Churn so I went along with it. I sampled the peanut butter which, even the one spoonful was somehow very heavy. So I went with the tried and true vanilla. To my surprise, the scoop this time was what I would constitute as a regular scoop. Yes I got more, but the inconsistency kind of irked me. Halfway through the ice cream, I could hear and feel little ice crystals between my teeth. That tells me something is not totally right with their ice-cream making process. Also, I tasted more sugar and milk than vanilla bean flavor. Overall, the vanilla was just OK.   I will happily go to Windsor any time but if someone suggests Churn, I may have to bow out. I don't wish the shop bad business. I like the interior decor, the festive displays of cookies, candy, etc.  I just don't feel the need to promote it to others.

The first time I went here, I didn't come away feeling very satisfied mostly because I'm cheap at times. I spent nearly $7 on a cookie and a "winkie." The winkie was good but it wasn't *that* good. I was sorta sulking about that and didn't think I'd go back. But alas, on my next visit, I got one of their Dairy-Queen-like "Tsoynamis" and damn if that stuff isn't crack. I went back a second time in four days because I had to have some of that cream, non-dairy goodness. I had a PB-Chocolate one and more recently a 'Smores one with marshmallow fluffer. Good stuff. I like the coconut milk better in some ways. Anyway, I have to be careful around that place but I mean that in a good way.

As card-carrying omnivore, I sometimes like to take a break from meat and play for the other team. I have never eaten at the Green original in Scottsdale. This place is so close to my work that I was able try it. The first time, I had their buffalo wings and an apricot noodle dish. Their take on ranch dressing with cucumber is a to-die-for concoction. What I wouldn't give to be swimming in that. Soooo good. They need to bottle that. NOW. The buffalo wings really tasted like what you'd get in a sports bar but they were a little salty for my taste. Another time I had the vegetarian chili fries. Very authentic tasting also. The faux-cheese was meh. But it went well with the fries. Another winner is their green chile hummus with the fried pita chips. I would love to work my way through the whole menu. I also like the decor of woods and recycled materials. So far, I haven't found much to complain about. If you're going to pick up to-go, definitely call ahead first. Also, parking can be tight; you may have to risk parking at Coco's. Still, I'm all for going 'green'!

I've only eaten here once but I really liked the fact that they offered a pizza with truffle oil (mmmmm). I tried this place on Halloween so I was in costume (a cheerleader outfit). They were pulled up in front of 180 Automotive. The couple running it were so nice. They put out a step ladder for me to sit on since I was on my bike. Everyone else was eating in their car or back in their office. I thought the price was very fair for the size. I had mushrooms, white cheese and truffle oil. Good stuff. I would eat their again even if it means having to cycle there.

Like almost every good restaurant in Phoenix, this place is hidden in, yes, a strip mall. But strip-mall facade be damned, this place is really as good as it gets. I've only been here once but already am eager to work my way through the entire menu. I went there earlier this month with three friends. We all sampled each other's food and nobody was in the least displeased with anything. First off, I will continue to sing the praises of the mantoo. These dumplings--which are the Afghani equivalent of Chinese wontons or ravioli--are filled with ground beef and onion and then topped with a yogurt sauce and a red sauce. Tender and flavor, little dough-bites of heaven. Another highlight was the goat curry. I had a taste of my friend's and it was perfectly tender. And the sauce is a great mix with their jasmine rice. I had the chicken boti in which the flavors were felt all the way through the meat. They have a few different kinds of naan bread. Loved the garlic naan but you'll need a breath mint later. I saw some reviews said the service is so-so. It did seem like we had to wait 5 or 10 minutes longer than one might be used to. But the restaurant--which isn't that big--was almost completely full. It's also important to note we were the only non-Middle-Eastern/Indian customers so that tells you the level of authenticity is pretty good. The service may have taken a bit longer but nobody was rude. Also, it looks like the kind of place where you go up to the register to take care of your bill. Anyway, I plan to make Khyber Halal a stop when I have visitors in town.

If I could give "no stars" or 0.2 stars, I would. Please, if you come across this company, do NOT book anything with them. I have no idea what happened inside their company walls. In June, I was able to book a tour for October. I actually got an email from a real person confirming my booking. After requesting my work allow me to work an earlier shift so I could make the 5 p.m. tour on time, I arrived to the meeting place (Copper Blues) and nobody ever showed up. I asked employees at Copper Blues where a tour group might meet. They said they hadn't seen a group there in a long time and it had nothing to do with their restaurant so they couldn't offer contact information either. Now I see the Ready to Nosh website no longer works. I'm wondering if this was a scam and if they might resurface with another company name sometime. Even if their company collapsed, they should have had the decency to let future bookings know. It wasn't until yesterday I checked out the Yelp reviews and I see a few other people (a few too many!) had the same terrible experience. Comforting to know I wasn't the only one though I still feel like a doofus. The best I could get was a credit from Living Social, not an actual refund. Either way, I won't be doing Living Social anytime soon. They need to do more research about who they make deals with. I'm very soured by the whole Living Social/Groupon/whatever experience.

This new breakfast/brunch place from the Tuck Shop owners is the lone gem in a row of typical chain restaurants at the SE corner of McDowell and 7th Avenue. By coincidence, I ended up eating here three Sundays in a row. So, I've been able to sample a variety of entrees from their menu--which isn't all your typical eggs and bacon. That's a good thing in this case. My favorite so far is their Tortilla Espanola_ the perfect texture and combination of potato and egg with a brava sauce. They also offer Portuguese donuts. They are OK. They are like funnel cakes but seem to be made from a lot more egg. The set-up is pretty in and out. You look at the menu and line up to place your order. If you order a beverage, you move over to the coffee bar after paying for your order.   Besides the scrumptious menu, I love the decor. They have space on the patio and a bike rack. Inside, there are floor-to-ceiling ropes smartly placed between people dining and people lining up to make their orders. I also like the hanging shelves of glass bottles behind the coffee bar. The brick and industrial materials gives the place a modern and simple feel.  I recommend getting there before 11 a.m. That's about when it starts getting pretty crowded. There is no signage out front so it's easy to miss. Parking is accessible on 7th Avenue, just south of McDowell.

Every time people from outside of Phoenix see pictures I post of Angels' TV dinners (only served Tuesday nights), they are astounded that that much food only costs $7. As my visiting NYC friend said, it's practically free _ or at least a killer bargain. It is a little bit like Christmas morning when you look and see on Facebook what Chef Brian will be serving for TV dinner. Past entrees have included fried chicken, meatloaf sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and chicken skewers. They always come with sides (thank god there's only enough to fill those little TV tray compartments) and a dessert.   I would already be a fan of Angels without the creative TV dinner nights. Even though I don't drink, the atmosphere here is fun, lively and so not pretentious. And it's always fun to people-watch. I used to think it was dominated by hipsters but I see white-collar office workers, men showing up in a bowtie and jacket look like possibly an ASU professor. It's very rare that you encounter someone crazy boozy. Also, the patio is a treat. They turn on the misters in the summer and they have a board out there as well with what's on tap.   The comfort food on the regular menu is amazing as well, the pizza and the sandwiches (you have to have at least once the nutter--peanut butter on sourdough with raspberry chipotle jam and marshmallow fluff and for an extra $1, peppered bacon). They also have big, fried spud tacos with sweet potatoes. A little too spicy for me but otherwise delicious. My only beef (or should I say pork?) is why on Earth would you serve spam sliders? I tried one on opening night and I could barely make it through half. Not worth the skyrocketing sodium levels. For the desserts, the "pizza" with marshmallow, pretzels and chocolate is so-so. But the housemade poptarts, I could inhale. A definite treat worth getting!  This has become one of my go-to spots for visitors or if I feel like I deserve a treat for the week. It's one of the best gastropub-restaurants to happen to Phoenix.

After biking by this place several times before it opened, finally got to go. On a Thursday night, there was a 45 minute wait. At first I was bemoaning it but then I figured it's better than waiting 4 hours at Pizzeria Bianco. I went for the burrata--which I could have just sustained myself on that. The house-made soft cheese was the perfect texture and not too salty. The scoop they give is plenty split between 3-4 people with the accompanying crostinis. I tried two different pizzas: one with mushroom and Schreiner's sausage, the other was "The Casanova" _ prosciutto, dates, ricotta and arugula. I never thought of dates on pizza but I'm a believer. The dates' sweetness combined with the prosciutto is almost heaven-sent. I liked that much better and would fight off anyone who tried to take my share. I know it may be kind of sucky that their pizzas are only available in one size. But hey, that means you get leftovers of some really fantastic pizza.  The vibe is definitely a cross of hipster and white-collar work crowd. Valet parking is the only option since the surrounding streets do not allow parking. Blah. Hoping the next time I go, it will be on my bike. Also, if it's packed, it may be hard to hear people if you're seated inside.

This place has been a blessing when I have had to work really late and I did not want to be relegated to Five Guys or Jack in the Box. I'm not a vegetarian but ya know, sometimes a girl wants to take a holiday! I have tried almost everything on the menu. I really like the chickpea burger and the beet burger (bathroom stool colors be damned). Not sure what seasonings they use for these patties, but they are always plenty flavorful. I give them props for the "eggplant bacon" which has a nice smokey taste.   As for the dessert, one time I stopped in there because I wanted a vegan chocolate orange pie, which was really smooth and light. I now follow them on Facebook just to see what dessert is in the pipeline.   I love the classic American diner feel with the different salt and pepper shakers on each table and the carousel for the desserts. Also, every staffer I've ever interacted with has been really nice. I hope they stay around for a long time.

I owe a debt to a friend for recommending Bootleggers to me. The first time I came here was for AZ Restaurant Week. I was absolutely bowled over. When I came in and said I wanted to see the Restaurant Week menu, the waitress took the menu out of my hands. I said "Wait, I wanted to choose something." Then she said "No, you get EVERYTHING." What?? Can this be?! Everything was delicious but the cuteness of the tasting proportions was deceptive. I was almost stuffed after the first course! The first plate had a mini grilled cheese and turkey sandwich, a baked potato soup and a very tender short rib with brussel sprouts and grilled pear. You could tell real thought went into the menu. The second course included a quarter section of a pumpkin waffle with chicken. I had to save that for the take-out box. But I miraculously found room for the smoked pork belly steak. So fat but so good.   The second time I went there was for the Bacon Board. What a great offer. Unfortunately it's the reason I can't go back there too often, hehe. I truly heart the Bacon Board.   I also love the decor. This is another instance of a restaurant that is too good for its strip-mall location. It's a kind of rustic feel with a lot of wood and metal but they use empty bottles for the light fixture that add a cozy ambiance. This place is conveniently located right by the Shea exit on the 51. I would take visitors here for sure, that is if their cholesterol levels aren't already on the edge. ;)

My friend who used to live in Denver, where I believe Snooze is based, told me before they opened that the food was wonderful. Well, she was right. I can't believe my good fortune that they moved into the Town & Country in my 'hood. I came after a doctor's appt because I was starving from fasting.   I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender. Another lady saw my bandage from having blood drawn and was considerate enough to ask me if I wanted a piece of toast or something. I ended up ordering a "flight" of pancakes where you can order 1 of 3 different flavors. Whoever decided to offer that option is, in my opinion, a brilliant person. I also love that they have such distinct and interesting pancake options. I ended up noshing on carrot cake (which ended up being the fave), sweet potato and a "pancake of the day" which had chocolate chips and cherries. I got a side of the house-made chicken sausage which was amazing. I'm not sure what herbs they seasoned with but it looks like a pounded, cubed steak. But it was very moist and not too salty.   I've only been back there another time since and I exercised the half and half option for their "art of hollandaise" items. Another great option! I got to try two kinds of but the winner was the Havana Benny. Here's the description: Shaved Niman Ranch ham and slow roasted pork served over a savory Swiss cheese bread pudding and topped with poached eggs, Dijon hollandaise and diced house pickles. The ham was really the winning ingredient here but all of it came together nicely.   I noticed this place draws a varying demographic. I saw families with kids and grandmas like one would see at IHOP. But I also saw hipsters on the patio and at the bar. I'm not sure if the place's popularity is at play or because it's new, but weekends, expect an hour wait for brunch. Otherwise, try to go on a week day.

I heart this place not just because it may be the only restaurant in metro Phoenix devoted to empanadas with dough that is so crispy and soft on the inside, but the owner is warm, friendly and just a really good guy. This place is only a block over from downtown Mesa's Main Street yet it feels so removed. It also at first glance appears not to be in the best neighborhood. The owner said there are quite a few halfway houses in the area. Still, instead of being intimidated by it, he offers a helping hand if needed. The place isn't that big but it's still an inviting space. That's in large part due to the repurposed wooden tables and the one long communal table. There are a couple of TVs but it doesn't feel like a sports bar.   As for the food, I had a special--arroz Colombiano--which came with shrimp, sausage and slices of avocado and red bell pepper on a huge pile of rice. It was kind of oily but still tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken and beef empanadas. Two is plenty for one meal. But by far, my favorite was the dessert one--fig, mozzarella and dulce de leche. That one is worth miles and miles of exercise. Definitely do yourself a favor and get that if nothing else.  The owner was flattered when I said I came all the way from central Phoenix, like it's super far. But he appreciated it because he knows there are a slew of choices closer to my home. I reassured him that I would be back!

An ice cream spot is a great addition to Roosevelt Row. I finally got to try this on a hot July night (well perhaps hot goes without saying). I have to say with frozen items being in there, that little house is no longer as stuffy. I always felt so bad for the people cooking for Nachobot and Rezbot when you combined the heat from outside and that generated by the stove. Also, it looks like the owners expanded the back somewhat or maybe because the indoor seating is gone now.   Anyway, back to Melt. I only came because I heard they had some really out of the ordinary flavors. I don't live in the neighborhood so I wasn't planning on coming just for regular stuff like chocolate chip or vanilla. When I heard they had a watermelon flavor, my taste buds wanted to accept the challenge. Luckily they're was no line on a Sunday night at 8 so I was free to try all the more intriguing flavors. The girl working behind the counter could not have been nicer. She kept encouraging me to sample and even pushed flavors she liked.   After much thought and sampling (yum!), I settled on carrot cake. Seems like encapsulating cafeteria desserts as ice cream flavors is a trend. I've had apple pie flavored ice cream but never carrot cake. What I really appreciated about it was that on top of the ice cream, there were walnuts and I think even grated carrots in it. And it was a great texture. No crunch icicles. I got a regular scoop in a waffle cone. I went with the waffle cones because they are locally made too. The one issue with the waffle cone: At some point, ice cream may start to drip. There will inevitably be a hole in the pointed end of the cone. I'm glad I got a spoon with my cone. At one point, I held the cone horizontally and just ate out of it. So, next time I may just do a cup or the more stout, lighter colored cones like you get at the store. The regular size scoop, in my eyes, was A LOT. My friend got a mini scoop in the waffle cone and I may go that route next time.   I will definitely go back. I need to work my way thru the list of flavors I want to try, starting with the watermelon-cilantro sorbet, which tasted very refreshing in the sample I had. They also have cucumber sorbet and the cinnamon ice cream I tried was pretty awesome.

I would gladly come here (wink, wink, see what I did there?) anytime. It's so refreshing to have a restaurant in the Biltmore area that actually offers a late-night menu (11pm-1am). For a while, it seemed like all late-night restaurants were in downtown Scottsdale or downtown Phoenix. I didn't realize it was the culinary spawn of a former Cowboy Ciao chef until the menu showed a Facebook URL for the chopped salad. So happy I can get the chopped salad so close to home.   The first time I went here was with two girlfriends. We shared a brussel sprout appetizer which was very yummy. It comes on some very creamy grits, which became a favorite. They come with the scallops, an entree I would recommend. I had the duck ramen which is now been changed to a mussel ramen (duck too expensive?). That was fine but nothing really beats traditional ramen. So, in hindsight I would have tried something more American, which is why my last time eating at The Gladly, I had the duck meatloaf. There was enough for two meals! Loved the texture and you could taste the duck in every bite and it comes with a foie gras mousse and grilled asparagus. That time, my brother had the special rib-eye which was 18 oz (!). That turned out to be $48. So bear in mind, The Gladly is good for if you are OK to splurge.   As for dessert, I would recommend the blueberry bread pudding. It wasn't dense and it didn't left me overly stuffed like the entrees. I also had their chocolate creme dessert which is VERY decadent. Might be better to share that.   I also recommend hitting the late night menu, not just for the food but for the company. A lot of the patrons are people who work at nearby restaurants. So I found myself having great chats with a bartender at Capitol Grille and a manager at Christopher's Crush. You get an insider's look at the Valley restaurant scene and great options for food. My favorite was the crispy chicken skin banh mi. SOOOOOO Tasty! It literally was all chicken skin. Hoping they bring it back around for a turn!

I have a special fondness for Pizza People because one time, I patronized their food truck on Halloween in a cheerleader costume and they felt bad I had no place to sit. So, the co-owner lent me their stepladder, LOL. Anyway, I *finally* tried this place a few days after Christmas for a Friday night dinner. It did not disappoint.   They were super accommodating to our party, which started out as five people but more friends showed up for drinks later. We had the garlic monkey bread, which is essentially just garlic rolls with a marinara sauce and an aioli. The bread had a really good texture but I wish it had been a little bit more garlicky. We also had the jalapeno halves stuffed with cheese, which were very tasty and not too spicy. Five of us had 3 10" pizzas--the Date Me (mozzarella, goat cheese, prosciutto, cheese, dates), the Hottie (jalapenos, sausage, serrano peppers, basil ) and the Fun Guy (mushroom, mozzarella, arugula, truffle oil). The Hottie was a little too hot for me to handle but it still tasted good. I'm a fan of truffle oil so no complaints about the Fun Guy. I highly endorse the Date Me because the combo of dates with cheese is almost culinary magic.   I know it seems like central Phoenix already has a lot of gourmet pizza places (Federal, The Parlor, Pomo like a mile away, and of course Pizzeria Bianco) but I think Pizza People have made themselves standout. Also, the space has a great atmosphere for talking intimately or with a big group. When I was there, one of the owners was catching up with some friends at one table. To me, that just added to the "town pub" feel.   Unfortunately, our server kept forgetting to factor in a $5 off coupon we had. I think he was overwhelmed because our party kept changing. Since I plan to eat here again, it wasn't a big deal so I just saved the coupon for next time.

I had physical therapy for 4 weeks straight in the same business complex as The Henry. But it didn't open until my third week. So, to celebrate my final session, my mom and I went over there for a late lunch.   This place, at least that day, pretty much embodied a healthy cross-section of Arcadia residents. First off, it was really crowded with, I'm betting, people who are Sam Fox loyalists. To avoid a wait for a table, we agreed to sit at a communal table. We ended up next to a group of five. They looked like they had just gone hiking or the two 30-something sisters went to yoga and the rest did something healthy and active. The patriarch in the group was going gaga because he had seen Sam Fox himself on his way inside and got up the nerve to say "How's it going Sam?" LOL. There were also a lot of well-dressed business people even though it was that slow week between Christmas Day and New Year's. There were also a lot of people with groups of kids--all well-dressed but a bit hyper of course.  I really like the decor set-up. It's very modern but industrial. There's a bicycle on the staircase that's behind the coffee bar area but not sure if it's someone's actual bike they use or it's there to give urban "street cred." You can go in just for the coffee bar that offers pressed juices.   As for the food, I was really impressed by the cheddar popovers with the smoked ham butter. They were so airy. I felt like they didn't fill me too much before my warm salmon salad arrived. That salad is probably the best healthy option. I couldn't believe how they combined pretty much every vegetable you hate as a child--cauliflower and brussel sprouts --but made it really flavorful. The salmon was cooked just right. So many times, restaurants screw up salmon. My mother had the C.B. and rye (housemade corn beef). The corn beef was tender but they really pile it on. It's a big sandwich. It keeps well for leftovers the next day, which you might need.   Considering the crowd of people who are very trendy and the wait, I may let some time pass before I eat there again unless it's on my way to another destination. But overall, I'd take someone here. There's a big enough parking lot that you don't have to do the valet.

I couldn't believe the good luck that another bakery was taking over where Cupcakes By Design was. I did not like the cupcake place so I was worried that this new bakery would also be overpriced and run by not very nice people. Happy to report I was wrong.   I love that this bakery offers fresh bread and croissants. But to me, their quiche is the most amazing of all the items. The texture is creamy and reminds me of the steamed egg dish my mom cooked growing up. I highly, highly recommend it. Bakery Phx also offers potato knishes which are really flavorful as well. Lisa also offers several different kinds of bread and I love being able to ride my bike home with a loaf of bread. I think her prices are fair and Lisa is very nice and seems like an accommodating person. You can tell by the baked goods, she's not phoning it in or using any boxed ingredients like the last place. So far, I've tried the quiche, cheese danish, croissants, knishes, breads and a mini cherry pie. All pretty good. I have not yet tried any of the cookies or the Texas-size cupcakes.   I know it's weird that there just happens to be another bakery on the other side of 16th Street. But trust me, they are quite different. If you want breads, mini pies and quiche, you can only get your 'phx' here.

I can't believe there is actually more than one Serbian restaurant in town and both are only a few miles apart. So, my experience here is colored by the fact that I'm a super-fan of Old Town Sarajevo. I didn't expect this place to be equally as fantastic but at least solid. So, armed with that knowledge, I cannot bring myself to give this place more than two so-so stars.   At first I thought it was quirky when I read that this place has Italian and Serbian menus. But apparently, a new owner took over about a month ago and decided to revise the menu and put the Serbian menu all in Serbian (!). I asked the manager/sole server if they had an English version--even though I already knew what the answer was: No. His suggestion: "You can just Google everything." True but what about customers who don't have smart phones? Sigh.  This place is in a strip mall--of course. You walk in and the interior is quite spacious. But it seemed like we were in a cheesy hotel restaurant in Las Vegas. There were big columns, a bar, speakers and lots of plastic trees. What was also kind of eerie was that except for two women and their rambunctious two children, the place was empty. And this was a Saturday night. There were about seven or eight people on the front patio. But most of them were men smoking and chatting and taking their time before ordering any food. Not a good sign that so few people came between 6 and 8 p.m. on a Saturday. I know it was Labor Day weekend but still...if this place is still around in a year, I will start to wonder if there is a Serbian mafia.  Because of my cold, I asked if I could get a cup of hot water which seemed to really throw our server. I thought if the place serves hot tea, they might offer it. But he said he could only give me hot water from the tap. I dunno, I just thought it was strange a request like that would weird a restaurant worker out.   Now onto the food. I had chicken soup because I was trying to fight off a cold. It was fine, not too salty as chicken soup tends to be. It hit the right spot but it's just a footnote. What I was really eager to try was their take on the cevapi. Basically a sausage sandwich. I was quite disappointed. Maybe I wouldn't be if it weren't for how other places turned me onto Serbian food. The sausages were fine and had enough seasonings. But the bread was blech. They were like giant crumpets/English muffins, not pita bread. The outside had charred streaks which tells you it was in an oven. But the underside of both pieces of bread had the texture of those last bites of French toast that have been sitting in the syrup too long. It just wasn't pleasant on the tongue. The plate came with onions and sour cream.   I was disappointed that the new menu dropped some items I wanted to try like stuffed cabbage rolls. I think this new owner needs to restore a few things. However, I doubt I will come here again just because I know where I can get similar food that's better tasting in my opinion. But I do wish them well.
