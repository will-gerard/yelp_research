Love the atmosphere at this place, and the fact that the food is great, too, makes this one of our favorite neighborhood haunts. With just a few counter seats inside the trailer that houses this diner-style joint, you may want to order through the window and post up at one of the many outdoor tables, especially if you're with a group. Try a cocktail to start while you wait for your order - they're strong but delicious, typically served in mason jars or goblets, which matches the laid back vibe of the place.   There are a number of great dishes here, but among the best are the Fried Green Tomato sandwich and the poutine. The tomatoes are perfectly fried, light and crispy, with greasy flavor enhanced by the slightly sweet zest of corn relish and the subtle heat of chipotle sauce. Served on toasted local bread, it's got just the right amount of crunch and flavor. Plus, it's unlike any sandwich you'll see on other menus around town. The poutine is also a must-try. Served with country-style gravy and perfectly distributed melted cheese on top of thin, crispy fries, it's not a traditional poutine but one of the most delicious versions in the Valley. If gravy's not your thing, the fries are just as delicious on their own.   Other highlights include the fried chicken sandwiches, which come in a number of variations featuring ingredients like honey, country gravy, and buffalo sauce. Although the biscuits they're served atop can be a bit dense, the chicken is perfectly moist and flavorful and never too greasy. The side of watermelon completes this southern-themed dish. And, if you're a burger lover, try one here. The meat is well-cooked with great flavor and the patties are perfectly portioned.   The service at Welcome Diner is casual but friendly and efficient. You'll get real attentiveness at the counter and maybe some small talk. Don't expect anything too formal - this is definitely a neighborhood joint, but you can tell the staff takes pride in their place of employment. And why wouldn't they? After all, Welcome Diner is a true neighborhood gem.

New Hong Kong is our go-to for local Chinese take-out. The service is fast, prices are reasonable, and food is delicious. Don't be fooled by the interior; what the place lacks in ambience, it makes up for in flavor...so long as you're looking for something more than sweet and sour pork and sesame chicken. If you are, make sure you get the Chinese menu and avoid the lunch buffet and you won't be disappointed. The soups are delicious - the West Lake Beef, a blend of creamy beef broth, fresh cilantro, silky tofu, and slices of beef, is one of our favorites. Salt and pepper anything is a surefire hit and the clay pots, which come out popping and sizzling, are a fun divergence from the fare you find at every other Chinese food restaurant around. Skip the chow mein, which isn't much of a step up from the noodles at Panda Express, but the Singapore noodles are some of the best in town.

Had the worst experience with Safeway this week.  Although I used to love their delivery service, I scheduled a delivery for Thursday between 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. and at 9:45 I received a call that they couldn't make it that day, but I could schedule a 2-hour window for Friday once customer service opened in the morning.  Called Friday morning and scheduled a delivery between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m., then worked from home to accommodate this delivery since I need my groceries for a dinner party Saturday that I'll have to start prepping Saturday morning.  At noon I was called and told that no one would deliver my groceries today.  After speaking with a customer services manager, AK, I was told someone would call me to make their best effort to arrange the delivery today.  An hour later, I get a call assuring me my groceries would NOT be delivered today but that I'd be called by customer service about delivery first thing Saturday morning.  It's now 3:30 and I've heard nothing from anyone.  Looks like I'll be waiting for my refund and getting my groceries at Fry's Food Stores tomorrow morning.

Update on how terrible this delivery service is:  Safeway gave me a $75 credit to make up for the fact that I got my last grocery delivery 42 hours late.  I used it to place another grocery delivery and, amazingly, I've been waiting an additional 45 minutes for it outside of my 2-hour delivery window and it still hasn't arrived and customer service can't find my driver.  Nice work, Safeway.

Durant's is one of Phoenix's oldest and most well-known steakhouses and, truly, it's earned that status.  The 50+ year old spot doesn't appear to have changed much over the years - there is little in the way of natural lighting and the interior screams old school steakhouse in the most charming of ways. If you enter through the back door, where the parking lot is, you'll get a glimpse of the bustling kitchen as you head into the main restaurant.     Sit at the bar or in the dining room - both are elegant and dimly lit and will provide full service.  Servers are always knowledgeable and service is always attentive here.  Make sure to order a drink while you glance over the menu - Duran'ts makes one of the best (and well-sized) martinis in town and has blue cheese stuffed olives.  They also have a nice wine list and a full bar.  Upon ordering your meal, you'll be presented with a small dish of crudite (carrots, green onions, olives, and celery, served on ice) to nosh on until your bread arrives:  a warm, crusty round loaf generously doused in garlic leek butter.  You won't know whether to dive in with your hands or a knife and fork.  Steaks here are always great and, unlike many of the newer steakhouses in town, are still served with soup or salad and your choice of side.  Durant's is also one of the best places in the Valley for liver - whether it be fried chicken livers as an appetizer or sauteed calves liver and onions as an entree.  The only disappointing item I've ever had are the oysters.  They're not the freshest or the most flavorful in town although the presentation is lovely  Skip the oysters in lieu of another of their delicious appetizers, or just enjoy the bread.  It really is that good.

Although the service was friendly here, the flavored didn't compare to Cafe Ga Hyang just down the street. Even the banchan didn't taste quite as fresh or well made. Hard to imagine coming back here when better Korean is just blocks further west on Dunlap.

I really want to give Christopher's five stars because I have always had delicious food there, love the atmosphere's blend of fine dining and a hipper, more urban feel, and have nothing but high praise for their drinks, wine list, and the servers' and bartenders' aptitude to make wine pairing suggestions.  But there is just something a little off with the service here, which makes me hold back on that final star.  Don't get me wrong, I have never had anything but good service here, but it just doesn't hold up to the level that you'd expect from a restaurant that, at least by menu and price, purports to be a higher level establishment.  I've found my servers to be friendly and provide adequate and timely service consistently, but more often than not, they're also a bit too familiar, too casual, too disinterested, and bordering on, if not well into the realm of, flippant.  If I was dining at Oregano's, the Vig, or a Sam Fox restaurant, this might not seem odd to me.  But at Christopher's, with its white napkins and tablecloths, proper place settings, and elegant French menu, it just mars my experience a bit.  That being said, Christopher's and Crush Lounge are always one of my favorite spots for a long, indulgent lunch, a delicious French dinner, or a few bites at the bar.  They have a solid burger and fries (truffled fries are also on the menu!), a lovely cheese selection, delicious mussels served with slices of Spanish chorizo, well-prepared fois gras, and an unmissable tender and rich pig's foot (try it, you'll like it!).  They do a reasonably priced and never-disappointing 6-course tasting menu ($75) with wine pairings ($25).  Their drinks are fantastic and I always find a wine I love while dining there.  I'd steer clear of the escargot en croute - it's baked with a layer of puff pastry rather than served with crusty bread and the addition of tomatoes, to me, just detracts from the richness of the garlic butter I love to sop up after each little snail has been devoured.  But, truly, it's difficult to go wrong with anything on Christopher's/Crush Lounge's menu.

Love this spot. Some of the best pizza in town with soft, airy crust, not to mention great pasta dishes, yummy desserts, and amazing drinks. Try the funghi if you like mushrooms - the mix of cheese, truffle oil, and mushrooms is to die for. And don't miss the garden mojito, my favorite take on a classic cocktail. This place is good for lunch or dinner, with high top bar seating, a small but charming patio that successfully shields guests from busy Camelback Road, and a sizable dining room. Service is always good although sometimes a bit slow, but with a delicious pie and a strong cocktail, you won't mind even if it is.

Best pho in town. Don't come for the service, but don't leave without eating the cha gio (egg rolls). So worth the incredibly low prices!

Easily the best coffee in the Valley, brewing Four Barrel beans, which they'll also sell (although they're not cheap, they're worth it!).  The fragrance alone will convince you that you made the right choice.  They always feature a daily drip and tea and can make the gamut of coffee specialty drinks.    The place might not be quite as hip as some of the other CenPho coffee bars, but it's much more conducive to work.  The industrial, slightly sterile setting includes both high top tables and low top tables but only a couple of comfy armchairs.  Rotating wall art spices the spot up a bit.    Although I haven't sampled all of the food and pastry options, what I have had is no insult to its parent restaurant, Matt's Big Breakfast.  Overall, a great spot for a meeting, a few solo hours working, or to grab a quick breakfast or cup of [amazing] joe with a friend.

This place is the best for noodles - hands down.  You'd pay three times this amount for noodles this delicious.  The noodles are not only made fresh, they're freshly hand-pulled before your eyes.  Watch through the glass window in the back of this small, no frills space as the noodles are stretched and pulled to the perfect thickness, then cooked up fresh to order.  Can't get noodles like this anywhere else in the state - the last time I had them was NYC's Chinatown, and I'm not convinced this place isn't better.  Make sure you remember to specify what type of noodles you want when you order:  handpulled are standard, but the shaved noodles are also a favorite of mine.  The shaved texture helps pull sauce into every nook and cranny - and the sauce is fantastic!  The XO sauce has great spice and flavor, the oyster sauce has a delicate sweetness, and the beef and lemon noodles' tangy, savory sauce - although unusual - has a strange addictive quality.  Although going just for the noodles is reason enough, don't miss the pig ears, either.  Served hot or cold and good either way, they are chewy, spicy, oily, and a great way to snack during the short wait for your food.  They pair nicely with the complimentary boiled peanuts.  You may also want an order of the dumplings, either steamed or pan fried.  While not the best dumplings in the Valley, an order is plentiful and not unsatisfying.  The dumplings' texture and flavor is great, but they are so plump and large that the seasoned meat flavor overpowers the dumpling.

Hue is a very fun place to stop in for a casual meal that offers more than what you're used to at your typical Vietnamese pho spot.  It's basically set in the food court of Mekong Plaza and you'll order from the counter using the menu and photographs of items before sitting in one of the few simple tables just a few feet from the counter.  When we were there, the counter server didn't speak a lot of English, but did his best to explain any items we questioned and came out multiple times to refill our small beverage cups.    What the place lacks in atmosphere, it makes up for in bang for your buck.  When we were there, we tried the banh beo, tiny rice cakes that slid into your mouth or onto a spoon in a single round piece from a circular dish - one order came with a dozen tiny dishes!  We also had the banh loc la, clear, chewy pillows of tapioca flour with bits of crispy shrimp inside, and the banh gio trung cut, a pyramid-shaped pocket of dense rice with wood ear mushrooms and what tasted like seasoned sausage inside (reminiscent of the banana leaf wrapped rice pockets you see at dim sum).  We weren't impressed by the cha gio tom, or egg rolls, but my husband loved the com tom nuoc cham (broken rice with pork) which was served with tomato and cucumber slices and a bowl of broth.  The pork was tender and flavorful and this dish is easily accessible to diners who might not be willing to try some of Hue Gourmet's less familiar dishes.  We can't wait to get back and try more of them!

Probably the best of the luxury theaters in the Valley.  Unlike the AMC Esplanade, which forces you to choose movie times based on the Fork and Screen or more plush (and more expensive) Cinema Suites experience, iPic offers both in the same theater.  You can opt for premium recliner seats that come with a blanket, pillow, and complimentary small popcorn, or the regular seating closer to the front, which is less plush and doesn't come with anything, including service.  Haven't tried the food here yet, but the drinks are good.  Service is decent, and what you'd expect for a bunch of servers who are plodding around in the dark trying to quietly distribute the correct orders to people they can barely see.  Expect to pay for your experience, but if you're looking for the best luxury theater experience, this is it.

Crepe Bar had a fun, casual atmosphere with a mix of high top and low top tables in the small and crowded space, which was bustling when we went.  I loved the photo light boxes lining the north wall.  What I didn't love was the wait at this partial-service spot.  Granted, I chose 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday for my first visit, but I doubt it slows down much any other time on the weekends - at least it didn't during the hour-plus we were there.    Forty minutes after ordering two crepes, my coffee mug was empty (Crepe Bar brews Heart coffee, which is a bit acidic for my tastes, but enjoyable nonetheless), I'd downed three plastic cups of the room temperature self-serve water, and we'd long finished the small dish of complimentary granola (which, frankly, is difficult to eat.  I'd rather they rolled them with some honey or peanut butter and made bite-size granola balls - picking up the individual oats, raisins, and nut mixture was messy and unpleasant).  Although the friendly (and hipster (I saw a lot of skinny cuffed jeans, flannel, and thick-rimmed glasses) staff had nothing to do with the delay, as it was clear the small kitchen could never keep up with the demand out front, I was a bit irritated by the time my Andouille Sausage and Pick Me Up crepes finally arrived.  But then, as I said, the crepes arrived.  And they were delicious enough to make my long wait a distant memory.  The Pick Me Up crepe, a coffee crepe with tangy espresso mascarpone, was delightfully rich and the crepe perfectly prepared - I could barely finish my half because it was so decadent, but it was ideal for sharing.  The Andouille Sausage crepe was also perfectly light and fluffy with a fantastic flavor reminiscent of fresh pasta dough.  The savory flavors melded perfectly with the Andouille sausage and egg, although the pimiento cheese sauce was a bit salty.  The accompanying fingerling potatoes were perfectly cooked, tender but crisp, tossed in herbs and what tasted like garlic oil.  I could have devoured a whole plate.  Any lingering annoyance I had from the wait was wholly dissipated by the arrival of two complimentary mini rose marshmallows toasted tableside and served with an artful splattering of dark chocolate.  The rose flavor really shone through in the marshmallows and the sweet treat polished off our meal on a high note.  In sum, prepare to wait - and I mean wait - if you head to Crepe Bar for weekend brunch, but definitely wait - it's worth it.  The best crepes I've had in the Valley thus far.  I can't wait to go back (and wait) to try the rest of the menu.

This is a great neighborhood spot for fresh, well-priced sushi and decent pho.  Although it's not the most authentic pho and doesn't come with quite as many mix-ins as some of the other joints in the avenues, the broth has great flavor.  Bun is also good, although not as good as at some of the other more expressly Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley.  The egg rolls are passable but, again, not the best in the Valley.  Decent beer list and the menu offers a wide range of types of Asian food and sushi rolls, as well as nigiri and sashimi.  The atmosphere is pleasantly eclectic, with benches mixed in with tables and a simple patio set-up.  A great downtown eatery for a casual Asian bite.

Went back here again last night.  Had been a little deterred when we tried to come a couple of Wednesdays ago only to find, through the unapologetic and off-putting comment of the alleged owner, that they had closed hours earlier than their Yelp and Yahoo results reflected, but chalked it up to summer hours and a bad night.  When we stopped in yesterday, however, we learned that Pallets recently changed ownership and management and is revamping its menu - and apparently its service.  Although it was our server's first night, she couldn't find the sweet and sour mix after we ordered our initial cocktails (something we found out after waiting long enough for her to search the entire premises with a fine-toothed comb), eventually made my husband a mouth-puckering-ly poor excuse for a whiskey sour, and could barely comprehend our order.  She had to be corrected twice, although she did ultimately get it right (thank goodness we didn't try to ask for any substitutions!).  After the food came out (and we got up to get our own soy sauce), she was very pleasant and attentive and kept our water glasses constantly filled.  The disappointment at that point, however, spread to the food.  To start, octopus tempura was painfully chewy and flavorless.  Having no menu beyond the sushi at this point, we were restricted to rolls and a short list of nigiri and sashimi, none of which was memorable. The three specialty sushi rolls we ordered were duller than we remembered, although the presentation gave us high hopes.  Salmon roe didn't have the same pop or salty goodness we expected after finding it at other Valley locations.  We left several pieces on our plates as we paid the check and left.    It really bums us out that this restaurant is going downhill because it used to be a real neighborhood gem.  Hopefully this is just a transition phase, but we'll have to have a reason to come back to find out.

Although the tacos here might pass in the middle of the country, given the number of delicious, authentic tacos you can find in the Valley for under $2, I have a hard time understanding why anyone would muscle through the tacos here.  Although the combinations sound trendy, they taste like an expired fad - something you'll regret when you look back on them.  Here, you need only wait a bite or two before that regret sets in.  On our first and only trip here, we had the guacamole, lamb taco, pork adovada taco, and Thai snapper taco.  Although you can choose to flavor your guacamole with tastes like jalapeno bacon and pineapple mint, we opted for the house version since it was our first time.  The guacamole, although a sizable portion, was completely lacking in flavor.  There was no hint of cilantro, jalapeno, or lime in any of the bites we tried.  A true waste of delicious avocado.  In each of the tacos, the flavors weren't well developed and didn't marry well.  Blue cheese and curry sauce might sound like interesting toppings for a "gourmet" taco, but if you can't pull it off, you shouldn't try.  Even the pork adovada was completely nondescript and lackluster, even despite the attempt to spruce it up with mango jicama relish and cotija cheese.  The side of "street corn" that accompanied the tacos was abysmal and tasted little better than canned corn drowning in butter.    This place might be good for drinks since the converted church is a nice change in your average scenery, with high ceilings, lots of wrought iron, and stained glass, but we would not come back here for food if it was free.

Love this partial service neighborhood spot where locally grown products shine. It's a great place to grab breakfast or a pastry (seriously, the pop tarts will change your life), a healthy and quick lunch, or even a coffee or drink at the bar. Although the salads are pricey, they're packed with fresh, flavorful and largely local vegetables. They also serve small fresh juices, including one with red pepper and Fresno chilis that has a bit of a kick. At lunchtime, you can simply grab and go with these items. Don't forget to add a homemade nutter butter or cookies and cream - the baked goods are awesome. You could even bring work - there's free wifi and it's not unusual to see people posting up with their laptops. The friendly staff won't mind if you set up shop.

Although I've only been to Jewel's for pastries and cakes, it is one of my favorite bakeries in the Valley.  You wouldn't even know Jewel's divine desserts are gluten-free.  Her pastries and cakes are moist and light and packed with flavor.  With a rotating array of goodies behind the counter, you'll never be at a loss to find something sweet and delicious when you stop in.

Love this spot.  Great ambiance, nice bar, fantastic rotating wine selection featuring select regions, and can't beat a $12 flight.  The staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful and timely at replenishing your bowls of complimentary popcorn.  You can also buy bottles here or they'll order anything you want by the case with a little advance notice, all for extremely reasonable price points.  I hate to mention the free tastings on Fridays because I don't want to lose my place at the bar, but this place is such a gem it'll be hard to keep it quiet.

Blink and you'll miss this spot, tucked next to a gas station just before the northeast corner of 19th Avenue and Glendale, which has become our go-to for good tacos in the Valley.  The exterior might look a bit intimidating, and the interior doesn't leave much to be said for atmosphere, but all you need are their extremely well-priced tacos to feel like this place could be your second home.  Carne asada is some of the best in the valley, fish tacos are phenomenal, and pastor and lengua were not disappointing.  The tortillas are the perfect weight and texture with just enough corn flavor.  We also tried the molote, a masa fritter with potato and chorizo, which was a crispy nugget of Mexican comfort food reminiscent of mashed potatoes if mashed potatoes got a stylish makeover that involved spice, black beans, and queso fresco wrapped in fried, corn-y goodness.  Service might be lacking, but for less than $15 to feed a hungry couple, you really can't complain.

We were really bummed to discover that this neighborhood diner is nothing worth trying. Although it was cute when we walked in and sat at the checked counter, the service - while friendly - was almost as bad as the food. You expect a diner to be quick - especially at the counter. This one was not. And we could see our food sitting on the warmers for a few minutes before it came to our counter seats.   Once it arrived, however, we sort of wished it hadn't. The chocolate chip waffle was flavorless except for the chocolate and so soggy I could barely get a bite down.   A country Benedict was poorly cooked, the biscuit doughy and the "poached" eggs practically hard boiled. The gravy wasn't bad, but nothing could save the dish as a whole - especially given the bland, barely fried portion of limp hash browns that came out on the plate as a side.   We also ordered the BLT on sourdough which came with crinkle cut fries. Although a crinkle cut usually gives a fry more crevices to become crisp and salty, these fries were neither. A soggy pile of flavorless potatoes, I think frozen fries cooked at home in the microwave could have turned out just as well. And the bacon was fatty - and not in a good way. More like in the way that indicates to you the bacon was cheap and poor quality. And that was probably the best of our dishes!  We were eager to leave after this breakfast but, again, we had to wait some time to close out, which was frustrating given how close we were to the cash register. Now that we're gone, we certainly won't be back.

Loving this place as one of the only spots for authentic DF-style Mexican food in the Valley, with hard-to-find items like huitlacoche, pambazo, and chiles en nogada on the menu!  Came here for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  We tried the quesadillas with mushrooms and queso Oaxaca and huitlacoches (basically corn smut, also known as Mexican truffles), which were perfectly fried and stuffed with their respective fillings.  (As you may know, a real quesadilla has no resemblance to that item you get at Taco Bell.)  We also had sopes with tender and flavorful carne asada, carnitas served with onions pickled with habanero for a generous kick, a gordita (again, nothing like what you order at Taco Bell, it's a corn masa patty split and stuffed with fillings) with requesen (similar to ricotta), creamy but simple guacamole topped with chopped jalapenos and served with totopos (thicker, larger versions of tortilla chips), and a pambazo, a sandwich similar to a torta, stuffed with potatoes, queso, and chorizo and made on soft buns baked in house and then dipped in chile before being fried, giving the huge sandwich an overall red hue.    Our experience was only heightened by the appearance of the chef at the table, a former Mexico City resident who seemingly embodies the matriarchal culinary culture of Mexico.  She was so friendly and welcoming, it made us that much more excited to return to try more of the menu, like their mole poblano and agua frescas.  The interior of the restaurant is simple but nicer than your average Mexican joint, with colorful tablecloths beneath glass tops and black and white photographs of El D.F. hanging on the walls.  Service was extremely friendly but not the swiftest - we had to ask for refills more than once.  And don't expect chips and salsa to arrive on your table when you sit down - it's not that kind of Mexican restaurant, but something more authentic and delicious.  Can't wait to go back!
