This place is great for lunch. They serve a wide variety of burgers, wraps, salads, and sandwiches. The people are nice and serve you well. The place has a very local feel to it that I love. Some thing you don't get from restaurant chains.

This is an awesome place especially if you do the Teppan. Request Allen if you can he is hilarious and can pretty much guarantee a great time. It is pricey at first glance but once you are done you actually get quite a bit of food for the money.

I'm a chilis fan because of their food. They always have the flavorful food I like which you can't get in Casa Grande. They are always adding new things to the menu an they give pretty good coupons. Service is good for the most part.

It is the only movie theatre in town and it is a fairly decent one. It delivers the movies we want to see. It does has high priced snacks but who doesn't? For me it is convenient and affordable if you get a loyalty cup.

I loved the food! It has great authentic food and it is all fresh. My only downside for not giving it 5 stars is the size of the place. It can fit probably around 20 people max. I think they need to move to a bigger location. Service was ok as well, give them a past because of the busyness.

If you have a big family with a lot of kids then you may like coming here. My past experience with Golden Corral was not too great. Food was bland and lukewarm, the steak was as tough as leather, and the atmosphere was chaotic. People are running into each other. I also think it is really bright inside. Decor needs to be update too

We use Brake Masters for our Desert Sun Trucks and Vans for Brake purposes and we have been very satisfied. Our trucks are key to our business and we need to have them up and going quickly. Brake Masters usually gets the job done that same day we bring it in. Thanks guys!

I like eegees, the food is ok not the best but that isn't why we go there for. They are know for their frozen drinks called eegees which are awesome and even more awesome in the summer time. Service is usually fast and friendly.

I always get the honey hot traditional wings. They are the best. Service ok. Better than it was when they first opened up but still can take awhile. I just think the service is the thing that needs to improve the most

They have delicious food! Better than most mexican restaurants. Wish the place was just a little bigger. The building is lacks logistics. You are sure to run into someone heading to the restroom. Nothing major though. Great place to eat!
