The non-sushi items were pretty impressive! I had a white fish taco that was absolutely delicious! The decor is pretty and the mood is very nice. I would like RA to bring down their happy hour prices-they are rather steep, and I don't appreciate the fact that they have 75 cents tagged on each price...it seems like an advertisement ploy to get you to think you're only paying $2, but in reality, you're almost paying $3. The sushi was not impressive-in the past, I heard that the cuts at RA were much bigger, but the sushi I had today was thin-more rice than tuna. The California roll fell short on size, flavor, and plating, and I had to go and ask for wasabi and ginger because none was given to us with our sushi. The ginger was also quite potent-more than the wasabi as far as heat. I wish it was pickled just a little longer. Please fix it RA! You're a pretty cool place!

This is for quality coffee drinkers. The prices are higher and the selection more limited, but you won't find better coffee in Tempe. The scones are well made, the cookies are great, and the atmosphere makes it a great place to study if you're a student. It's very popular, so be prepared to wait for your drink.

Very good. It was extremely busy, so I thought that the service would be slow, but it wasn't. Good food-creeps are a bit thicker and heartier than I've had, but both the savory and the sweet ones were crammed full. Good decor-the place has regulars, which is a tribute to the good service and food. My only wish is that they get a "seat yourself" or a "please wait to be seated sign" and a "take out" sign for first timers.

Delicious, well crafted, healthy food! The options were many and it was hard to decide. Lots of substitutions in case you're vegan, gluten free, etc. Cucumber water, smoothies, juices, and even a huge case of vegan desserts! Peaceful atmosphere and wonderful service. Loved it all-new favorite breakfast joint!

I don't think I could love Mood Swings (soon to be under a different name) any more than I do. It's always a treat to get my hair done and the stylists are such experts. I know very very little about hair and possibilities, so it's nice to have someone who knows what's the best cut for my face shape and is also able to answer my many questions. I just recently switched to a white/blonde from brunette and every time I look in the mirror, I fall in love again with my new hair color. Ask for any of them-Emily is the bomb!!!!

Outstanding! Tried everything but the beef short ribs-the brisket does melt in your mouth! The sausage is wonderfully spiced and not at all heavy in texture. Absolutely incredible-worth the wait. The staff is very nice too and it's very cool to see you meats get cut right in front of you. Wish they had a recycle bin. ;) a must try!!!

Wonderful. The service was great, the food was so delicious and fresh, and the wait staff accommodated my special needs. Great portion size. We realized half way through our meal that we hadn't touched our drinks because the food was so epic. Go here-it's worth it. :)

Dynamite. So lovely, it was like going to a spa! The patio is wonderful in the nice cool of the morning. Good that they open at 7! The coffee was wonderful, service terrific, atmosphere and ambiance so calming and wonderful. That and the pastry (I got a chocolate stick) was like chocolate strudel! Delicious! Good job guys-I hope your business continues to flourish! I'll definitely come back!
