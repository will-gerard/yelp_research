If you're looking to buy an instrument ALWAYS check here first, ESPECIALLY if you are a lefty. We have purchased many instruments super cheap for my boyfriend here just because they are left handed and rarely anyone buys them so they want to get rid of it. If your lucky they throw in a free strap or something too. The guys here are very helpful and knowledgeable, sometimes they can be dicks but they always answer your questions and they don't screw you over. They have a huge variety of instruments to choose from, so check it out!

Juan's is a classic, always dependable and never disappoints. I've been coming here since my high school days and everyone I bring here loves it. Great prices and fast service. I'm a fan of the carne asada nachos and a margarita on the rocks.

I love this place! It's where I first discovered my love of sushi, I had eaten sushi before, but nothing quite as amazing as the Vegas roll I had here, and I am OBSESSED with it, it is the best I have ever had. also the ramen here is delicious. I recommend getting a big bowl of the Hakata.

Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and it's 1/2 off during happy hour. I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi! Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!

My go-to shop for Vibram Five Fingers. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, they don't overprice the shoes like many other places and I can get in and out no problem. I have purchased all three pairs of my VFF's here and will continue to do so in the future. PLUS they just started a rewards system so every $250.00 you spend you get $25 to spend towards your next purchase!

Came here with a restaurant.com coupon, so worth it!We started off with delicious barbecue sliders, I had the Cajun combination of chicken jambalaya, chicken and sausage gumbo and an AMAZING crawfish andouille. My boyfriend tried the catfish po-boy and we finished it off with a bourbon sundae. The food was delicious, the service was great and they had decent live music. I will be going back soon!

I am a big fan of fish tacos, some people cringe at the thought, but that's because they have never had a fish taco from here. Rubio's by far has the best fish taco, it is absolutely delicious. After 2:30 pm on Tuesday is "Taco Tuesday" and fish taco's are $1.50/ea.

A great takeout restaurant, it is a sit down restaurant as well but I don't much care for the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food is delicious, I recommend the yellow curry with chicken.

I absolutely LOVE this place. I go almost every week for lunch between classes. They have the best fries around. I always order the Hawaiin burger, fries and don't forget the red cream soda. Hamburger Works is one of the rare places that carries red cream soda, if you haven't had it before you must try it. The staff here is always friendly and welcoming.

Grab some grub before you shop, the restaurant inside Baiz is great, I reccomend the schwarma wraps and falafel. I love this market, the people are nice and sometimes you can find neat stuff for super cheap. "Yes sweetie I do need this banana slicer, you expect me to slice my own bananas? and it comes with an apple slicer, not JUST a banana slicer".

I absolutely LOVE Autumn Court, it is my go-to chinese take-out/delivery restaurant. Not just because it is only a block or two away from my home, but because it is the best. The food is delicious and pretty inexpensive, the portions are also very generous. We are addicted to he general Tso's chicken, and for $20 for two orders of it along with two containers of rice, it's enough to feed two and have enough leftover for another meal. Two of my other favorites are the honey crisp chicken and the orange peel chicken. The service is usually very fast for pickup it's usually ready in 15-20 mins and delivery no more than 30 mins(unless you order delivery on a sat/sun night then it can be an hour and a half  to two hours wait). Another bonus of getting takeout/delivery from here is that the entrees come in these reusable, microwavable containers, I order from here so often that I never have to buy tupperware lol.

I love this place, when classes are in session, I'm here like 3-4 times a week. They have delicious pastries and drinks. Plus its by all the sweet vintage shops, a great way to kill a few hours.

I ordered my food to go and as soon as I got in the car the aroma of the food was too tempting to wait until I got home. I was just going to have a few fries and be on my way but before I knew it I was moving on to the whiz-whit and the fries were devoured. Fresh cut fries are my weakness and these were hot and seasoned to perfection. Try the whiz-whit it's delicious! I just found my new go-to late night restaurant, I love that it's open 24 hours. Don't be surprised if you see me back tomorrow night.

Ordered off of grubhub last night. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with half ranch crust and half butter/cheese crust and the Italian sub. Both were delicious, especially the Italian sub was absolutely fantastic, I will definitely be ordering from here again.

Worst Starbucks ever. I ordered a Valencia orange refresher made with green tea instead of water on my way to work this morning, got the refresher made without water and without green tea, got charged for the tea I didn't get and I couldn't even finish the drink.  The drink they made me was just straight refresher concentrate it was super acidic, ridiculously sweet and it was by far the worst drink I have ever had at a Starbucks and the longest wait I've ever had to endure at a drive-thru. I will NEVER be going to this Starbucks again.

One of my favorite places for decent priced delivery. If you order from grub hub they have special perks like if you spend $25 you get a free large sweet and sour chicken. The prices are good for the amount of food you get, I usually spend no more than $30 and get four or five large entree's and rice that comes with each one. The food is great, but delivery takes a while.

This company is awful. They don't call you back and instead IF they even respond they send an e-mail.  They're always conveniently out of the office.  They rented me a home that was not up to code at all the whole front half of the electrical did not work.  I've had a broken dryer for 6 months and they won't respond to me or maintenance because they don't want to pay for it even though it is in my lease. They don't care what conditions people live in as long as they get their money.

I used to come here all the time during high school. Inexpensive food, great greasy burgers, the fries here are delicious! They have many different flavors of milkshakes,  I usually get the butterscotch.  No restrooms, limited seating space, I recommend getting your food to go.

My parents took me to brunch here for my 20th birthday, The staff was super friendly, brought out a delicious birthday cake that they were kind enough to box for me to take home so that I could enjoy the desert selection at the buffet. The Buffet was fantastic, everything was delicious from fresh fruit and cheeses, to eggs benedict, prime rib, and a large selection of mouth watering deserts. I would definitely recommend coming for their Sunday brunch anytime, and come hungry because there is so much to eat and it's all delicious.

Great happy hour, I can't believe I'm saying this, but their sushi is definitely better than their sister restaurant Stingray, where I USED to be a regular until I came here. Happy Hour is 1/2 off house sushi, appetizers and drinks. The prices are similar to stingray but with a much bigger selection, not only for the sushi but for the appetizers and drinks as well. I will be back...ALL THE TIME!  Try the Astro Boy!

This is definitely one of my favorite Thai restaurants. It is not too far from Phoenix College, and they have a great lunch deal. It's about $8 for a delicious house salad, and entree. I always get the delicious yellow curry which is served with rice, an egg roll and a slice of watermelon. The food here is so delicious, I come here at LEAST once a week when I'm in school.

I can't believe I haven't already written a review for this place!!! Sorry Guys! So if you're reading this review, debating on if you should check this place out tonight, stop thinking and GO!  Super fun, great atmosphere, I have come to know the owner and staff as you will soon too, and they are amazing. This is a great place to go with a group of friends, there's boardgames, music, poetry slams, and great company! Don't forget to wear your coolest hat on friday for a fun treat!

WORST BUFFET EVER! The place was disgusting and dirty, I had a feeling we would regret this after we got seated to our filthy booth. The food was terrible, my boyfriend and I ended up getting food poisoning from eating at this "restaurant". We will never be going back there again.

I absolutely LOVE the creamy white rice from Revo. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the food is yummy too, but not as yummy as that rice, if I could get a giant tub of the rice to take home, I would. Don't forget to try the wonderful lemonade

We went here with a $25 certificate from restaurant.com and this place is amazing, I have been back twice since we first tried it a week prior. We had the Cubano Sliders, the Empanadas, the Pernil Asado tacos, the Short Rib Barbacoa tacos and the Carne Asada tacos. Hands down, my absolute favorite dish would have to have been the Cubano sliders, rolls filed with ham(real ham, not lunchmeat), pulled pork, swiss, dijon mustard( which tastes like it has horseradish in it, very strong so be warned) and served with a slide of fantastic sweet potato fries, by far the best sweet potato fries I have had in a long time. The Empanadas were savory and delicious, the best kind of empanada is one filled with meat.  The Pernil Asado, was my favorite of the three tacos we tried, not spicy like the short rib, but juicy, sweet and savory. The Short Rib was delicious as well, but spicy, the lingering kind of spicy, so be prepared. I was told that this place was considered "mexican food" but from experiencing even just the appetizers I would say it's way more Cuban than Mexican.

Finally rode down to Rita's one hot summer evening and I'm sure glad I did! I am in love with their gelati. Remember Mr. Misty floats from dairy queen? It's like that! Not only is the frozen custard delicious, but swedish fish flavored italian ice to go with it?! SOLD! I can't get enough of this place.

LOVE LOVE LOVE Green! I would easily become a vegetarian if I could afford to eat here for every meal forever. The mock chicken is fantastic, I can't get enough of it, the texture is amazing. I like it way better than actual chicken, no other mock chicken can compare. Try the buffalo wings, samosas, krab puffs and curry with mock chicken, TRY EVERYTHING. And don't forget the vimto! Then head next door for some delicious pastries and tsoynamis!

The food is great but the service is horrible. It doesn't matter what time you go or if you order for pickup the customer service is just terrible. I'm usually pretty forgiving and I will never be coming here again.

I followed the owner Hollis here from a previous tattoo shop, he does amazing work and is well worth the hour drive it takes me to see him. He has a great staff consisting of talented artists to fit all of your tattoo needs from girly to gore. The staff is friendly and welcoming, the shop is gorgeous; very clean and inviting. I recommend this shop to everyone, classy shop, talented artists, great customer service, what's not to love?
