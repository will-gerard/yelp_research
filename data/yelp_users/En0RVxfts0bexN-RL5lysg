Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was "that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words "that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done"

here for happy hour on the patio 1st strike was the lipstick on my draft beer glass. 2nd was the the very rude server who treated our group like we came to dine and dash... the good points the chicken fundio and them accommodating my friends lap dog on their patio. good food bad service. yo Pancho stop being an ass no tip for you buddy.

This was the perfect spot to kick off my 40th birthday bar crawl! A friend and I decided to book a weekend this July at The Clarendon and we could not have picked a more fabulous place. I was impressed from the moment we walked into the lobby with it tasteful artsy decor... I love red and black! Adjacent to the lobby is the hotel bar then a little further in the Gallo Blanco restaurant which I made sure to try both. what more can I say I other than I enjoyed every inch of that hotel... The roof top patio... The beautiful pool... restaurant, bar and the $20 up grade for a suite...SCORE! That suite was more like a small apartment very chic and confortable. We had a blast and I cannot wait to go back. I have to add that the staff was awesome... Thanks for a wonderful weekend

OMG... I love this place! I'm not sure how long this place has been here but it's soooo awesome and the kicker is Z pizza is its neighbor and they are connected so you can grab a slice of pizza then go get ice cream or coffee or a latte. Simply fabulous for say a casual day time date the atmosphere is nostalgic and funky... oh and pink! Free wifi and cool tables and couches. Its places like this that are adding flavor to downtown phoenix where I just happen to live... Watch out mill avenue were coming for you in a bigger and better way!

I really loved my stay at The Clarendon Hotel this July and the Gallo Blanco cafe was convenient for breakfast but I ordered to take back to my room for myself and two guest. I had some sort of breakfast burrito which was pretty good but my guest ordered chorizo eggs and refried beans, which was all thrown into a brown take out box... It looked so unappealing. I mean to have to scrape refried beans from the bottom of a box... not cool! It really lacked presentation. However their yogurt with fruit was great as was the fruit con creama. I had higher expectations and perhaps maybe it was because of me ordering it to take to the room but they need to figure out a better way to serve beans. would I give them another chance... only to dine in =D

YUMMY! OK so I live 2 blocks away from this place and I pass by it all the time and I've always wondered whats going on in that place and why is it always so packed? I'd never cared to try it because I believed it to be all patio but little did I know of the awesome inside dining area. my favorite neighborhood breakfast spot was Matt's Big Breakfast but sorry Matt the line @ your place today blew me right into Local Breeze, and in my opinion is the real "BIG BREAKFAST" and is now my new neighborhood place for breakfast. I had "The Plate" 2 eggs cooked to order atop a hearty pile of freshly made potatoes O'Brien and 4 big pieces bacon with freshly baked buttermilk biscuit served with what looked like homemade preserves. I had the nerve to also order a half order of apple brandy french toast... omg if that was a half order lord help me! The total experience @ Local Breeze was absolutely delicious and right in my backyard... I can't wait to go back and yes it was about $20 for myself alone but with those portions and flavor it's well worth it!

Well I was so excited when I seen a new restaurants was popping up the block from me... yay food! But honestly for me the food looks better than it taste. I love the idea but didn't care for the food. I may swing in again for their sangria it awesome, but the food not for me.

The food looked great my nephew had a huge double burger my niece the fried zucchini. The one thing that struck me as odd when we walked in was that the place was very smokey.  I've worked in restaurants before so there was either a ventilation problem or what I believe is they hadn't cleaned out the overhead filters they looked dirty.  my eyes were burning it's as if they were using charcoal briquettes indoors but they weren't.  I ordered the shrimp platter which seem to be ok until I ate my last one I remember it tasting odd but I blew it off in the morning I was nauseous and on the toilet diarrhea City I sit here with stomach cramps and fever I always support small businesses but this place sorry you guys need to clean it up. Good luck.

Really good food I'd say worth the wait pretty much always packed but food is awesome and portions are large service is real friendly. I'd given them 5 stars but the wait can sometimes be a bit much. Thanks Matt

You have to try this place-  A genius fusion of authentic Mexican food with an urban downtown vibe. When I first seen the once abandon corners spring to life I was in awe the space is beautiful the seating open and inviting. But don't let the atmosphere steal the show because the food is  delicious. So far my favorite has to be the huge brunch chorizo burrito it seems to be built for 2 cuz I'm a big eater and I can only eat half. Then there is the pork belly taco and omg the torta that's made of hotdogs sounds odd but it's so good with the avocados in thick cut bacon. The stalf is friendly and I love the  energy there makes me smile. If I'd point out anything that needs improvement that would be faster service although honestly I didn't mind because there's so much to see and hear with live music or dj most evenings this is my  urban retreat.

After a long awaited debut... ahhh absolutely lovely. The sign sums it up quite well eat relax play. I had tea and crumpets for the first time in my life and they were delicious, mix that with a amazing selection of music coming from an awesome sound system beautiful weather and the laughter of children almost brought a tear to my eye on the cozy porch of this lovey historic building where I wrote this review. Very well done guys.
