I just love this place!!!! I go here about 3-5 times a month and I always get my momas trio and a side salad and I get my favorite waitress on the weekends(Mallory). THe food is very tastful and the prices are good compared to alot of other places in the area. When you go and you get bread in the start of your meal I recommend you ask for some Arobiatta sauce as this is awesome for dipping. I also ask for some red sauce to keep things a little light. If your looking for service and good food go to macshak and ask for Mallory. She is great and funny and always gets things right. LOVE IT!!!

This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at, everything is so close that it only take 10-15 mins to get where you want to be, and on top of that, there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games. I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great one.!!!!Plus the weather is always great!!

This is a very middle of the action movie theater I would say and I am only giving it 4 stars is because they tend to go a little cheap on some of the snack bar items compared to the other Harkins I have been to in the valley. I love this movie theater and the seating is very nice compared to those other movie theaters out there, these seats give you the luxary to recline a little bit and for the most part they are not full during the day when I hit up a early movie and grab a $1 soda and cheap popcorn. I recommend Harkins to all my friends and fmaily in the valley and I can see everyone loving this moving theater so much.

Wow, without a doubt one of the best place for pizza in the world paired with great wine and also awesome service. With the brick oven that carrys the pizza through the cooking process and gives it that elegant flavor, you can not beat grimaldis pizzeria. My wife and I go to this pizzeria almost every friday to catch up with friends and have that great feeling of being home and also feeling like you are wanted. We plan to keep going to this place for years to come based off food and service.

Horrible experience! We went here because we heard they had free wine tasting from a couple of friends and we thought we could try a few new ones out since we were from Napa valley and love wine our selfs. Well we got treated like we were there to steal stuff. We asked the person in the store if we could try the free taste of wine selections, they said they would go in back and see what bottles they had free to open, we said OK. The person comes back out and asked us if we were going to buy anything and the free wine tasting was only for buying customers. WE were SHOCKED being that this was starting to feel like a bait and buy situation now!! We said we were not sure because we wanted to taste some wines . So we got denied a free wine tasting even though they had a sign up saying they had it and then we were told we had to buy to get free wine..Really? I am from wine country and know how things should be run and this places gets a big zero on customer satisfaction and there wines were also over priced compared to many other retail stores I have been to and also winery's. I hope they change things.

Very good service, the food was good, the sweet potato fries really hit the spot and the atmosphere is also very inviting. My only peeve was the the decor was a little weird, but I'm not eating the decor so I could handle it. I do go here very often and enjoy it every time
