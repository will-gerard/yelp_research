Everyone deserves to indulge sometimes and if you're looking to do so - try the Red Door Spa. My latest appointment consisted of an eighty minute Desert Hot Stone massage with my fave girl- Lisa.   As you walk in, the staff always give nice welcomes and is eager to show you around even if it's not your first time. The women's changing area is very clean and stocked with everything a person needs to refresh (e.g., mouthwash, hairspray, perfume). The lockers are easy to use which is a plus.  I truly enjoy my spa experiences each time I come here. Lisa is a great massage therapist - she is attentive to what you want out of the appointment (relaxation vs. super tense areas) and is always checking in during the massage.   I do think some things could be better and will outline them here.   - the locker area is small and with another person there simultaneously = very tight quarters  - there is only one women's restroom - there is not a lounging area for after your spa experience and having one would be nice  - they offer a subpar biscotti as a snack with water  - the lounging area available as you wait to get called back for your massage is not very inviting - perhaps a bigger space with more relaxed seating options  - the prices are steep - expect to throw down when you come   Overall, I enjoy coming to the Red Door Spa once in a while and I always call ahead to make an appointment with Lisa. Cheers till next time!

As we walked in, the front desk staff was very friendly and we only had to wait about 3 minutes to get sat outside.   Our waitress came to the table quickly and right away offered to tell us the specials. We alerted her immediately that we were there to enjoy dessert. I was in the mood for a piece of cheesecake and when I saw they had a pineapple upside down one on their menu, the decision was made.   Unfortunately, the pineapple upside down cheesecake was all gone which left me having to decide on another dessert. I chose the strawberry shortcake. However, when it arrived I was very disappointed. The shortcake was very hard and cold, not fresh whatsoever. On the top of the shortcake their was a sugar crust made with raw sugar. The strawberries were the best thing about this dessert.   I won't be going back, but if you do - good luck, this place is hit and miss.

This place never lets me down. One of the great things about Malee's is that they're always consistent - the customer service is great and the food is tasty.   Even though it was a Friday night, we got seated right away (without a reservation). It was the perfect night to sit outside so and we were happy to be sat on their patio.   We were very pleased with our appetizers and main dishes. My favorite part of the meal was the crab rangoons. They're filled with flavor, crunchy, and the plum dipping sauce is divine. The crab-shrimp rolls my husband got were OK. His favorite part of the meal was the half pineapple that his main dish was served in (see pic.)! My Thai basil chicken was yummy and a three spice level was spot on, but it needed more sauce and was dry. Also, we were not initially given enough rice and had to ask for more. Last but not least, I enjoyed a frozen Thai basil margarita that was not overly sweet and very refreshing. My husband enjoyed their Thai beer which was light and smooth.   Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner and look forward to the next time. This was a great way to end a long week!

Bandera is never disappointing. I like to make reservations online because it's usually packed. Even on the weekdays, it can be busy.   I've become accustomed to ordering the skillet cornbread as an appetizer. It is buttery with a kick and the top is sweet and crunchy. Together, this makes it for one of the best cornbreads you'll ever have. My go-to-dish is the meatloaf which is filled with a juicy mushroom flavor and goes perfect with their garlic mashed potatoes. The enchiladas are worth a try as well and my husband most recently enjoyed the prime rib.   They have a descent selection of beers with a few on draft. Lots of good wine to choose from and even some signature drinks such as the Caipirinha filled with cachaca, sugar cane, and lime. Although having too many of these can become pricey rather fast, definitely worth a try. This was similar to a mojito, but better in my opinion.   Finally, they currently offer an Oreo cookie sandwich dessert. The chocolate cookie was interesting- not identical to an Oreo, but similar. The ice cream was homemade and the entire thing sat in a warm bed of espresso sauce with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Definitely worth a try!

Chef Eddie's creations really are "woohoo! As good as it gets!" Not only is the food amazing for a great price, but the service is OUTSTANDING.   Typically, my peeps and I sit in the bar area to enjoy the great Happy Hour deals (4pm to close EVERYDAY). Whether I'm with my girlfriends or my husband as we walk inside, we are greeted with big smiles. The waiters and waitresses do a great job at making you feel at home. On top of this, Chef Eddie usually stops by to say "hello" or ask how things are.   My favorite dish is the Seafood Wontons - I cannot get enough of these and if I could, I would eat them everyday! These are not your typical wontons as they are filled with Salmon instead of crab and are on top an apricot sauce (UNBELIEVABLE). Another one of my favorites is Chef Eddie's famous meatloaf which is always super moist and packed with flavor on top velvety mashed potatoes covered with crispy onion strings drizzled with mushroom jus. Also worth a try is the asparagus risotto. :) Let's also not forget dessert! There are lots to choose from and if you love fruit cobblers, chocolate, and cheesecake then you won't be disappointed.   I encourage you to try Eddie's House ASAP!

North in Arcadia is one of my favorite FRCs by far. Every time we visit we really enjoy ourselves. If you haven't tried their happy hours, you're missing out- especially on Sunday =  ALL DAY!   To start things off, I had the phenomenal cinnamon roll (only 3 bucks!) paired with their delicious coffee served in their adorable red mugs. The roll is big enough for sharing, but you probably won't want to. I took the rest of mine home to enjoy with my coffee the next day. :)   Next, I enjoyed a few mimosas and their HH pizza of the day (only 8 bucks!). The pizza that day had pepperoni, tomatoes, zucchini, fresh mozzarella, and balsamic. The dough was very fresh and it's just right - not too thick & not too thin. This is definitely enough for sharing as well. Also, they have a great deal on Sunday- a pizza and bottle of wine = $20!   Not only is the food good, but the atmosphere is spot on. This place is pretty spacious so the wait is never really long AND if there is no outside seating, sitting inside is just as nice. The restaurant is open with lots of natural light and fresh air. PLUS, the service is great!   We'll definitely be back again and I'm looking forward! Thanks North, Arcadia!

Although I have not been checking in regularly here, I come quite often and am always satisfied with my Starbucks experience. Thus, I was surprised with the overall low scoring review.   Don't get me wrong, the wait times can be pretty long ranging from 10-15 mins, but when we want Starbucks it is what it is.   I think the baristas are very friendly and are willing to correct a mistake if needed. For example, one time my iced espresso was made with 4 pumps of pumpkin syrup instead of my requested 1 pump; however, once I alerted them, they fixed it without a problem.   IF want to grab a quick coffee, this Starbucks may not be your best option. For that, head to the market just south.   IF you want to indulge in your favorite Starbucks treat and are willing to wait a little longer, you're at the right place. Enjoy!

Walking into this restaurant it seemed very clean and quiet. I was surprised that there were not more customers (we had the restaurant all to ourselves) given it was a Sunday afternoon. The waitress came over immediately to take our drink order and was very pleasant.   I wasn't too hungry so I decided to order the chicken nuggets (waitress said they were homemade) with the mac n cheese and baked beans. My husband made a smarter choice and ordered the pulled pork, also the mac n cheese, and green beans. The food came out pretty fast, maybe a little too fast in my opinion.   Honestly, I was not impressed whatsoever. Although my husband really enjoyed his sandwich along with his sides, I did not. The mac n cheese was prepared with processed cheese sauce (maybe Velveeta) and the nuggets reminded me of Mc Donald's. I'm sure lots of people (like my husband-he ate most of mine in addition to his :)) enjoy food prepared like this, but me not so much. It may be even that my expectations were too high. The tastiest side dish I ordered was the baked beans which did seem homemade.  Perhaps I made poor food choices this time, but not sure I'll chance it and go back.

After seeing the other reviews and their overall score of a five, I was very excited to try this place. Let me tell you - it did not disappoint.   We went during HH on a Sat and as soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a friendly "hello." It did not take long before our server came over and offered menus plus an explanation of their HH specials.    I tried the chicken noodle soup for starters and it was absolutely yummy. It had great seasoning and was filled with egg noodles and shredded chicken breast. Plus, our server included yummy oyster crackers. Definitely one of the hardiest chicken noodle soups I have had at a restaurant.   For our main courses we had the pulled pork sammie and a cheeseburger. The pork was seasoned to perfection, not too salty and not too sweet. The burger was cooked just the way I like it and was bursting with flavor topped with juicy tomato slices, crispy bacon, and perfectly pickled pickles. My number one ordered the salad as a side and I ordered the French fries (we shared both).   During our lunch, the Chef (pretty sure it was Jeff), came by to check on us. He was pleased with both our responses and empty plates. Also, our server was outstanding- he was very informative and attentive.   We are both looking forward to having a second meal at Ten. Until next time....

Since having legit Mexican food in CA over Thanksgiving weekend (Taqueria de Anda), I have been wishing for a place that good here...I finally found it.   I feel that I'm pretty simple when it comes to Mexican food. The two things that matter most to me are the beans and tortillas. I personally feel that the tortilla will make or break the burrito.   The moment I opened the package I knew I made the right choice. My burrito looked like a perfect pillow filled of beans, rice, and cheese. The flavors were on point -no salsa needed. The beans reminded me of my great grandma's, the rice was fluffy orange, and the tortilla was homemade.   I know lots of people douse their food in sauces, but I do not. However, next time I look forward to trying their salsa bar with tacos. In addition to salsa, they have spicy carrots and onions for added flavor.   Until next time -thank you for fulfilling my beans, rice, and cheese burrito dreams.
