This is the only place I take my car to have to cleaned. The service is friendly and professional and there quality of work has ways been superior in my opinion.   The waiting area is comfortable and clean, not that I have I use it much....at the right time of day you can get in and out fairly quickly.   I recommend this location!

I feel confident about taking my car to Toyo Motors. I feel I am getting an honest opinion on what my car repairs needs are. The customer lobby area is clean and comfortable. The customer service is always warm and inviting. Yes, I could take my car somewhere else and maybe pay a little less, but when it comes to the safety of my family, I want to know my car is in good order.

A local legend, but I just recently ate here for the first time, and I wondered what took me so long....  the food was really good. We had the buttermilk southern fried chicken breast and burger, both where great. The service was a little slow but it was a Friday night so its forgivable. The staff was warm and friendly. All in all, I am glad we tried it and we will be back.

I have been here many times. Bobby Q has been and always will be one of my favorite restaurants. Not only is the food great and the service excellent but it's consistently great. Some restaurants are hit and miss, but not here.   On my last visit, I ordered the southern fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and Mac n chz. As a southerner, I was admittedly skeptical about boneless fried chicken but it was delicious.  Usually I get a steak or BBQ, each of which are always delicious.

Dr. Mark Bonacci  and Holly of Arizona Pain and Posture are amazing. As a competitive bodybuilding I put my body through a lot of stress. When I was dealing with painful back and hip injuries, they helped get me back up and at 'em!

Staff is friendly but I don't use the service and the company makes cancelation very difficult.

Foodies everywhere are cringing, but I really like Carrabas. It's a chain and typically my preference is to go to locally owned spots, but there are exceptions.   Every time I'm here the food is really good, it's consistent and I have always had great service. This is true for all locations but I typically go to the one on Frank Lloyd Write and Scottsdale road.   My last visit I sat at the bar and the bartender was really friendly and the  food was served fast and it was really good. My only complaint is that the bartender didn't give me her name, that happens to be a huge pet peeve of mine. But non the less, I enjoyed the experience and will go back.   I had a pepperoni pizza but I almost always order a fillet Marsala. Pizza was good

The product and service is good but this place is filthy. There is garbage piled up outside and the bathrooms are just disgusting.

I started seeing Dr. Zamora about 2 years ago. I woke up one morning in so much back pain I could hardly move.  I knew I needed to find a chiropractor that would look at my overall health and put together a wellness plan tailored to me, not a one size fits all. I found exactly what I was looking for at Imagine Wellness. Dr. Zamora is kind and professional and the office staff is always pleasant, courteous and helpful. In one visit you will see what I see, Dr. Zamora personally cares about her patients and their well being. I am very excited to have found them and strongly recommend them to anyone!

I'm having a hard time with this review. I was really frustrated earlier when I pulled up to the store 10 minutes before closing and the employee closed and locked the door in front of me, but I have since calmed down. I do really like their coffee but This makes trip #4 that I ended up at Starbucks because the Matador was closed. I think they have great coffee, adequate (not friendly but not rude either) service, but the hours are so very limited. With longer hours I would for sure frequent them more but as it stands now, it's not worth it for me to go back a 5th time

I have wanted to try this place for a very long time. With only weekend hours available it's been very hard for me to make it. But on this Sunday, I had some free time and pulled up my bookmarks looking for a good breakfast place.    I am glad I tried it. I ordered pancakes, which is my go to breakfast. But at the last minute I decided to also get an omelette BLT. Be able to use one of my favorite sandwiches but most the time it's just plain bread/bacon, and not worth it.   In this case it was absolutely worth it! The BLT it was simply delicious. I am very glad I ordered it and will come back again just for the sandwich.   All in all a great experience and I would recommend this place; it's a cute shop with a warm atmosphere. The staff was a little disoriented and the service was slow but everyone was very friendly and welcoming.

I enjoyed my first two visits and plan to return. The staff is friendly, especially Keagen. She greeted me with a smile and warm introduction.   I was leery do the hydration and red light beds. I've read good things but the results seemed to good to be true for a few minutes laying in a bed. But I must say I am pleasantly surprised.   The salon is clean, the beds are nice and large enough to get in and out of easily. AND, they give you plenty of time to get undressed and ready. Most salons give you 5 mins which isn't enough to undress and put on lotion. My Resort gives you 10 mins. This may seem like a small detail but this focus on the customer experience is what sets this salon apart from the others.

This bar has become my go to bar. Its very nice and modern and the service is always top notch. Its never very crowded which could be a good thing, in fact its usually quite.

What others seem to dislike about Kashmir are the same things I LOVE above it. If you are looking for a cookie cutter spa or salon experience, you WILL NOT find it here.   Everything about Kashmir is unique and original. The atmosphere is very cool, modern and relaxing and the service is top notch. It truly is a break from the manila, pretentious atmosphere you find in most salons.

Passport has really great coffee. If you like flavored coffee they have a huge selection. My personal favorite so far is the vanilla nut.  I recently tried the pumpkin spice, I will say it did not have very much pumpkin flavoring. But all the other flavors I tried I have loved.

I almost missed this bar completely, its hidden but its a hidden gem! Very much worth checking out. I was surprised at how clean the place is and how great the food is.   Have to say, the best burger in North Phoenix, maybe even the entire valley. Great beers on tap, not the same domestics everyone else has.

I think this is a great little breakfast place and I'm glad it's in my neighborhood. I have been here a few times.     It's always super busy but the service is usually  very good. The food is pretty good, some things are better than others  Coffee is good. Pancakes are good. BLT is awesome. Bacon flight is good!

One of my favorite places to eat. The food is great. In my opinion best burger in Phoenix. My only complaint is that the service is always slow. Pleasant but slow. I always enjoy my meal but leave a little annoyed at how long it took to get the bill and cash out.

Because the food is so great I continue to come back and I must say the service is getting much better. The staff had always been friendly but at my last visit, the service was fast too.

I base all of my reviews on service and this place doesn't disappoint. The service is very attentive, extremely friendly and fast.   Loved the Farmers Daughter burger. I can see how it won the best of Phoenix.   My only regret is it took me so long to try Ingo!

This place is super cute! I had a whoopie cookie and it was great! The best part though, the service was great! There is something to be said about greeting your customers with a smile

Most of the reviews that are negative are service related. My experience was quit different. This was my first visit and I stopped in because I wanted something different than the usual breakfast avail in N Phx. I was immediately greeted and sat. My server was Albert. I know this because he told me his name! Amazing concept but most restaurants do not ask this of their waitstaff and it is the simplest of gestures which makes the guest feel comfortable and at ease.  Albert was quick, friendly and efficient. He even helped me order slightly off menu to be sure I got what I wanted.  The food was good, but a tip: the American waffle would be much better with fresh fruit. The pur√©e made the waffle soggy.   This place is simple with a simple menu. Nothing fancy but it's good and the service was great. Deserves the stars.

I enjoyed my experience. The staff is extremely polite and professional. The float was interesting and I found it to be very relaxing. I was able to sleep for most of the hour and felt extremely refreshed after. I expected to have a hard time turning my mind off, but for me this wasn't the case.

I really wanted to like this place. Based on the write up in The Phoenix New Times, we were really looking forward to eating and hanging out here.  The restaurant and grounds are beautiful. It's a new business, I think they may have opened to early, before working all the kinks out of their service. And please understand, I expected that to some degree but what I can't tolerate is negligent or rude service.    - The hostesses were rude and distracted and one was chomping on chewing gum while she was talking to us.  - there were several employees standing around the hostess stand in a frenzied state of confusion  - we were told it would be between 45 mins and 2 hours for a wait. Had a table not come avail while we were waiting on our friends, we would have left. The wait was about 45 mins which is acceptable  - while waiting we sat outside in the cocktail area to wait get drinks and apps. The server was very slow and rude. Based on this alone I would have left  - server inside was pleasant but after we sat and ordered we never saw him again. No one came by to check on us, to see how the food was or to refill drinks or for us to order cocktails.   Good idea on the concept and I hope you do well. Pizza was good, burger and fries were just okay. But average food and poor service make it hard to want to come back when there are so many good restaurants in Phoenix now.
