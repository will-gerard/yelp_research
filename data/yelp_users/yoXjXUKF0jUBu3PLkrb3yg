I'm a transplanted Texas girl from Austin. I was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place. The atmosphere is great, the waitress was amusingly surly. Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.     I advise they add salt & pepper at the least.

I was craving a good Italian style pizza & found it at Pino's! Roland was our waiter and he was great. Attentive even when busy. The Caprese salad was phenomenal and the calzone lived up to the reviews. Great find! Nothing fancy but great food.

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!  Unlicensed with Az Registrar of Contractors! F Grade with BBB of Arizona ****BE CAREFUL*****   While they first sound reasonable and honest, in actuality, they are not honest and UNlicensed!   In Dec. I  was not provided a receipt or warranty and repair was performed with USED parts!! After trying for months  the owner Mark won't return calls, provide a receipt or honor HIS OFFER to reimburse me regarding my used part. The day Mark did the work, he finished and stated he "forgot" his receipt book and would swing by later that afternoon with it. Never saw him again. I've even left vm messages w/my address and he won't take the time to mail a receipt! I'm guessing I may get one after the "warranty" period ends. Sadly he represented himself as a Christian business owner and i thought that would make him an honorable and trust-worthy businessman. There are other companies out there that will provide the same level of service w/out having to deal with a liar and thief.  Go to www.azroc.gov to see license was revoked for this company.
