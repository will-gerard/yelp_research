Not a fan of this place we went on Friday for my daughters birthday and the food was not tasty at all. Here is some of the issues I have When you go as a big party the tip is automatically included in your meal which in my opinion makes the waiting staff not care about the level of service they provide. I understand the pay for a server is lower than any other profession but for this reason you have to have the customer service skills to make people want to give you a good tip.  The food was not good at all!!! There was no flavor in any of it and if I can make better homemade spaghetti from scratch  I expect an Italian restaurant to make some better than me.  The dishes were dirty. They gave you clear plastic cups for water and sodas and you can see how dirty the dishes are, it just makes you question what else they don't clean right. Never again will I come to the spaghetti factory I would rather go else where or make my own if I am in need of some Italian food.

Overall this place was ok I got the tongue and Asada tacos both good but not anything super special  I thought I ordered the street tacos but I guess I must have ordered the soft tacos which comes in a much larger corn tortilla. The tortillas were a little to greasy for my taste but the meat was good. The salsas were good and they have the Mexican coke bottles which I love but found they price them a little to high. My husband had the huevos  rancheros which he said were good. It's not the best nor the worst Mexican food we've had and the service was nice but kind of looked a little mad lol We probably will come back but it really wasn't a experience that wow me enough to say I will for sure.

Horrible service I understand that it can get backed up when it's busy but when everyone around you is getting their attention from their server and yours is no where to be found it is upsetting  My son asked for a cup of water and when asked if he could get a refill it never came  My daughters food never arrived and we had no silver ware to eat our food. We asked to get more coffee and silver ware and after waiting for 15 minutes we decided to walk out since my daughter never got her food and we had nothing to eat our food with. Will never go to this ihop again If I could give them a negative star I would

Really good pizza awesome mozzarella sticks. Giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because the waitress was just sitting there watching us as we ate. She was very nice but it was just uncomfortable. It's a small little place not recommended for big parties but the pizza is awesome. We had the thin crust cheese and a pepperoni large  Excellent we will be ordering from them but this time as a take out instead or maybe delivery :)

First let me say the don't have coke products was about to say no to my boyfriend because of it but so glad I didn't. Pizza was amazing we had the large pepperoni. It was fresh out of the oven and it was absolutely one of the best pizzas I have ever had. We also tired the mozzarella sticks and wings because we like to try it all lol. The wings were very good if you like them hot go with the hot if not I would recommend the medium. The mozzarella sticks were delicious!! Seriously a great place to eat. The only bad things (bedside the coke thing lol) is their ac was out so it was a little warm to sit there but seeing as we live in AZ I didn't mind it helped burn the calories lol. Still worth it for me to eat here it was great we will be coming  again

What a great little shop for anyone who loves building models. This is our first visit and although a small little shop I was very impressed with their selection. If you or your kids love building model cars or planes check this place out you won't be disappointed.

First time coming here and it was delicious. I recommend it for the whole family. The burgers were fresh and seasoned well. The chicken tenders my daughter had were tasty. The custards were amazing as well. Great place for a burger friendly service and a great meal. Can't beat that

Awesome store My mother gave us an umbrella cockatoo, which she said the place she bought her at told her she was a baby but after bringing her here and getting her groom we were told she was much older at least in her teens. She is having a hard time adjusting to us and we thought we were doing something wrong. We learned we need to be patience with her since she probably has never been held and since she is older we need to give her time. They offered the help and even told us what types of food would be good for her. This is our 3rd visit to this shop and it is our favorite. You can tell they love birds and are willing to help their customers out. This store is a little far from where we live but because of the service and genuine help we get we will be life time customers

Please would have received a 5 stars if the services was better but the waitress had a little too much attitude and did not correct and error on our meal. Anyways the food is awesome we had the oyster special half a dozen and a medium size shrimp cocktail both Delish my husband had the Asada plate which he said was pretty good beans were awesome but the meat was a little chewy  We also tried their shrimp tostada and it was good, just have to eat it as soon as it comes in because the tostada gets soggy. Michelada was good overall I think one of the best MARISCOS places I have been too.

And now I remember why I don't come to this chilis Not busy enough for them to be giving this slow of services. Wait time was too long for them having so many open tables. Waiting over 20 minutes for an appetizer that is just chips and salsa is ridiculous. Our server didn't even bother to ask if we needed refill but just rudely walked by to say she is bringing refills and never did. Seriously over this place and will never return  Not worth it

Awesome place!!! First time here and the food was delicious. The batter was light and not greasy. We had te sandwich, the bread was a great combination to the fish. The fries were crispy and very good. Calamari was huge and Delish. Customer service was friendly and we felt very welcome. We will be coming back and bringing the whole family.

The best donuts in the valley The size is more than enough they are pretty big compare to other shops. The actual dough is just amazing it is not hard or dry it is just the best and most tasting thing you can put in your mouth. I do like going anywhere else but here. My favorite is the glazed donuts but I have tried a few others and they are all good. Their coffee are good too and the staff is always friendly. I live about 15 minutes away but it is worth the drive in the morning to get a donut  Love love love this place

Wow! I am truly amazed by this place and it is now one of my favorite places. It is small so not recommended for big groups but the food is OUTSTANDING. I had the Pacific white fish tacos with rice and beans Amazing  My boyfriend and son had the carne Asada style burrito and a rice and beans burrito both said thy were amazing. The guacamole was delish and the horchata was really good. My boyfriend even said it tasted like Christmas lol  This place is really good and I was very impressed service was good can't wait to come back again

I had the California burger it was ok  It wasn't the best burger in the world but it was decent my son had the bacon cheeseburger rocket style which comes in a sub. He liked it the only thing we both agreed on was the rocket sauce is a little too sweet and makes the bread a little soggy. The fries were very good nice me crispy. The best part is the drink selection you have. You can get a bottle drink with ur meal which makes it an enjoyable experience. Overall good place not sure if we would come back for the burgers but for sure for some drinks

Very good tacos  Will be the spot the next time we come to Vegas. Good size for the price (2.25) a lot of meat. You walk in and there is three different spots where you can order your tacos Depending which one you want. We got there and it wasn't so packed but once we started to order it got super busy. Recommend this place oh and they are making the tortillas by hand :)

This place is nice when you walk in and it smells good but the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The price for what you get was not worth it. The beans were burnt and had no flavor, the plate was super hot but the rice was just luke warm. The fajitas had a weird taste to them and I am not sure what seasonings were used. The salsa they give you taste like pace which there isn't a problem with pace but I could have gotten that at home. The woman's bathroom is designed for tall people and not very kid friendly. Not somewhere I would come back to. The waitress was very nice and that is the only reason why I am giving it a two instead of 1 star

All I have to say is wow I called to see if I can get a quote for my green pool. Instead I reach Dan who was very helpful. He walked me through what I would need and how to do it. He explained to me the product I was using wasn't working and he even offered me I call him back if I needed help. I truly felt as if he wants to help people and not just screw people over with over price and unnecessary chemicals. I would recommend this company because he offered to help and took the time to educate me in proper pool cleaning.

I normally love jimmy johns but their platters were horrible. My company order from them for an event not only did the miss half the order but the sandwiches were not even made right. One sandwich had a little small piece of ham and the rest was cheese it was very disappointing. The bread was not soft like usual and it really was disappointing because you can tell they didn't even care to make the order right. I don't know of I would ever order a catering event again

This was our 2nd time coming because the first time it was good. Well I don't know what happened but the waiter did not even pay attention to what he was doing. The food wasn't even good the green chili tasted water down and the carne Asada plate tasted like the meat was old. The horchata was disgusting and this will be the last time we come here

Great place it is very good the service was awesome Mike was awesome best service we have ever had. The decor was really nice and the overall atmosphere was great. We had the guacamole which was delicious and the tacos and steak burrito were really good. It was a little on the expensive side but well worth it. For dessert we had the churro torta one of the best things I have eaten. The michelada was really good I would recommend this place

The only reason why they are getting a 4 star is because the banana stand and dulce de leche shake are amazing but the food was just ok  The fries were to crispy and I like my fries crispy but not to the point where they are hard to eat. The burgers were ok, had good flavor but not worth the price and the tacos just weren't up to my standards the beef was ok and the chicken was dry. Overall this is a great place shakes but wouldn't come back for just the food just the shakes :)

They really don't even deserve the one star but if you are ordering for delivery expect it to be at least an hour. If you call it's always it's out for delivery or they are pulling up right now and it will still take another 20 minutes after that. For a company that is supposedly "super fast" this location has failed. I am not basing this on just one experience unfortunately I have given them many of opportunities and will no longer be ordering from them. Very disappointed!!!!!! My boss even order a pizza and that came before my sandwich wtf.. Well if you have time to waste and are not very hungry than order from this location.

1st time coming to this place and loved it. As soon as you walk in you feel welcome and everyone is very nice. We had the guacamole app which was very good and you can taste how fresh it was, had a little to much red onion but still very yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken club sandwich and I had the BLT which were both amazing. I also had a pear martini and he had a cucumber mule. I wasn't a fan of the cucumber mule but he liked it and said it was fresh and would be awesome when it gets hot out here in AZ. Overall this place is awesome and we will be coming back to try some of their other items

Pretty impressed with this place. We used to come here when it was Gus pizza but haven't been around since we don't live in this side of town. We decided after the fight to go to get pizza since everything else would be close. We were surprised to see it was closed and D.P dough had replaced we were hungry and decided to give it a try. Thank goodness we did this place is awesome very clean and very friendly. I had the Italian absolutely delicious and my boyfriend had the pepperoni very good too. We also had their homemade cookies which they make when you order them and oh my goodness sooooo good. This place is worth the drive and we will be back.
