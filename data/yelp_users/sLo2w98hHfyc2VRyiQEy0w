We came here last Thursday to celebrate my grandmother's birthday and we were able to reserve the back room. They were able to accommodate our extra guest and the wait staff was very friendly (and funny!)  Personally, I had the rainbow trout and potatoes with Reisling and Pinot Grigio. It's a pricier place (not as pricy as Vincent's on Camelback), but well worth it!  The food and wine were phenomenal and a good time was had by all!

I've been seeing this dentist for more than ten years, now! Dr. Spilotro and the staff have always been professional and friendly and they usually run on time. The facility is very welcoming even to families with small children (they play cartoon network in the waiting room, lol!) I feel comfortable referring all my friends and family!

I have had my membership at LA Fitness for almost two years now.  I did not attend often at first because I was unsure how to use the weights and machines, so after saving up some money I enrolled in personal training with Jake.  He was a phenomenal trainer and motivated me to push myself and keep coming back.  After two months with this trainer, he was promoted to "master trainer" which, unfortunately for me, meant it would cost me more. I reluctantly accepted to stay in his schedule since I was seeing great results with him. Two months later, he left LA fitness to pursue something else.  So, I called LA fitness a week or two later and asked to be placed back into a regular trainer's schedule back at the old rate that I was at, because going up to the master trainer rate was hard on me financially. I spoke with Ashleen, the personal training manager, and she said that would not be a problem and from here on out I would go back to the old rate and I could see John for personal training.  My next payment went through for the master training rate, so I called Ashleen again and after many unreturned phone calls I finally got ahold of her and she informed me that there is just something I have to sign in order to clear the new agreement at which point she will credit me back the difference to my account.  I went in and signed the necessary form and still it he next month I was still charged at the old rate!!!!! So, this is two months I am getting overcharged. I, again, called Ashleen numerous times without a response.  I decided at this point that I needed to call corporate. I called them and they told me I still needed to sign the agreement (that I had already signed four weeks prior at this point). I explained the situation and I was told to go in and speak with Prague this time.  I walked in and Prague was available who gave me the form to sign and it was clear that I would be credited back the past three months of overcharges.  I asked when I should expect to be credited back and he said the next Monday or Tuesday (which was five days away to account for the 4th of July holiday weekend).  It is now July 14th and I still have not seen a penny back of the past three months I have been overcharged. My whole family and many of my friends attend this gym and I will be sure to tell them about this experience because clearly the staff here cares only about if they are getting their money and nothing else. As soon as my contract is up I will look into personal training somewhere else and so will everyone in my family.

I visit this nail salon whenever I have have extra money to go out with my girlfriends. The technicians are always very friendly and able to accommodate us. In fact, one night they stayed past closing to do our appointments last minute!

I was on my way home from work late one night and my two front tires went flat! I pulled into the parking lot as they were closing and they re-opened their shop and filled up my tires to make sure I could get home okay even with a slow leak.  Even better, the mechanic called my dad (who has also been a long time customer of Knudsen's) to make sure that I got home safely.  I, of course, needed to get my tires replaced and they were able to price match and get me a good deal. I will continue to go here for my auto repairs and tune ups and I would definitely refer all my friends and family because this is clearly a company that cares about their customers!

I visited this Einstein's location today for a bagel and a coffee with my boyfriend today. When I walked in I didn't get a greeting or anything, just a cashier staring at me. After staring at each other for about 20 seconds, I guessed that was my queue to order. I was just surprised that I didn't get a hello or a greeting or anything. It was a little weird. Otherwise, my order was correct and tasted good. The cashier was just a little odd and the staff didn't seem to move very fast. I would visit again, but probably not at this location.

Today was my first visit with our dog, Calli. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and so were the technicians. The appointment to get her rabies shot was quick, easy and reasonably priced. I'll definitely return for future shots and check ups.   There was also a really cute kitty sitting on the counter when we arrived!!!! :)

The deli guy is really friendly! The girl at Starbucks is not. :\

I went here earlier this week on a work outing. The food and drinks were very fresh and tasted good! If they weren't so pricy I would definitely stop in here more often. I will probably visit again on a special occasion.

The cookies are great! They will even heat them up for you in their Otis Spunkmeyer oven! :)

My boyfriend and I visited touch of healing on a deal we found online. We scheduled our appointment for right before the vacation we were taking that weekend.  It was a great experience! The masseuses, Jenelle Jennifer (I think that was her name) were experienced and it made for a very relaxing start to our trip out of town. I have been back since and I got to meet the owner, Maria, who also does great work. I look forward to visiting again!

My boyfriend and I just moved into the area recently and we decided to try this diner close by.  The wait staff were mostly in training and they we're pretty busy, but the food was good quality. It was the best French toast I have ever had. My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak, hashbrowns and eggs which also looked really good. The coffee wasn't great but I will definitely be going back for the food!

I got out of class early tonight and I was starving. I drove by Isa's pizza which was, unfortunately, closed. I decided to stop in to Charr as they were still open and close by.  I sat at the bar and the bartenders we very friendly. I ordered the fried zucchini and a blue moon. They are very generous with the zucchini even though it is only an appetizer and the beer was cold and refreshing. The zucchini came with a side of ranch, but I prefer marinara, which they did not have, but they were able to accommodate me with their pomodoro soup which is very similar. I will definitely be going back and bringing friends. :)

I was looking through living social for a massage offer in my area and came across a unique option from Purrfect Aesthetics for a massage and sugar scrub. I checked out the yelp reviews and only saw good things so I purchased the voucher and made an appointment. When I called she was booked pretty far out, so I booked for her next available Sunday.   This is not a place that I would compare to typical massage/aesthetics offices. She will let you pick what you want to listen to and what scrubs and scents you prefer.  Liz has a great technique! I felt like a millions bucks when I left and she also gave me some follow up specials. She does not cut corners even if it's a living social!  I will definitely be back and referring friends and family!

This new pizza place just opened up, and they left a flier on my door. I decided to call in on one of the specials they were having for a large pizza and 20 wings. The pizza arrived quickly (about 30-40 minutes as promised) and it tasted great! The prices are fair and they give you a lot of food. The slices are huge and I had leftovers for a few days after!   The second time I ordered from them, I'm not sue what changed, but the pizza seemed a lot oilier. The cheese seemed to be really saturated in the oils, so I wasn't super impressed the second time around. The leftovers ended up sitting in the fridge until I threw them out.  I will probably order from them again (perhaps the second order was a fluke) and I will probably try the cheesy bread that was recommended in a previous review of this place.  Fairly priced, friendly staff, fair-good quality food and conveniently delivers!
