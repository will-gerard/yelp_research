We tried the melting pot for the first time last night for my Birthday. We had some decently high expectations and after reading several reviews had high hopes. The radiant itself smelled a little off upon entering...like it was old and someone had been trying to clean away the mildew and mold...once seated we already knew what we wanted as we had reviewed the menu the night before. We figured we would do the four course meal. And to save money we would share. It was plenty of food. The taste was not bad it want anything truly to rave about, but the experience was fun. I don't feel the cost of everything was worth it.Even sharing most everything except the salad which we ordered extra the bill was quite high...I don't think the fondu experiences was enough to have paid as much as we did.Probably won't go back as I said before nothing was really that tasty...except the salad seasoning (garlic and wine seasoning) which we got to take home as we had a Yelp check in bonus. But I think if we ever do fondu again maybe a home kit would be sufficient.

We were going to go here for bfast this morning.  However when we got there we saw a server out front rushing inside with a cigarette...she put it out in the dirt and left it on the brick ledge by the door...I popped out to go inside and the smell of smoke was so strong I told my family not to even get out of the car. This has completely turned us away from wanting to eat here. We won't be returning.

This is our favorite buffet. We come here whenever we can. The food is always fresh ava they gave toons to choose from. We don't eat sushi but we took my niece and she loved that it was a option. My husband and I both like that we can go get noodles with whatever mix ins we want acc have it made there in front of us. It's also nice my kids are still young enough that they eat either free or very cheap (since they don't really eat much or often just take a few bites off my plate it's nice that is not so expensive for them) the servers are usually nice, not always the most attentive...It depends on what time of day or day of the week you go. But deff one of our fave spots!

I go to this starbucks often enough...however today in the drive thru I ordered a chai tea misto w/the tea bags not the sugar filled syrup...when I got to the window (after a 15min wait in line) I was informed that they are out of the tea bags. They made instead with the syrup a chai tea but hot! I informed I wanted on ice. They poured the beverage over ice where all the ice melted....in color it was white as if it were only steamed milk...in got home and delivered my husbands perfect mocha to him and tried my milky looking drink. It was disgusting. It was exactly what it looked like watered down milk! Uhg...next time I will go to the Starbucks in Frys up the street or to Ray and Rural. I just paid $4+ for watered down milk. I have never had any big issue here before, but if this is any sign of what could be in the future when it is busy then I won't be back to this location. A couple times they mixed up my order in the past but fixedb it immediately. This was the worst coffee experience I have ever had and the barista who made the beverage should be ashamed for putting it out into the world.

We love coming here. We don't get to very often but when we do it's always nice. We've only had breakfast here 4 or 5 times, but we would go back any time. The food is always good and the service is always above and beyond expectations. Love the atmosphere and although it's always slammed and packed is worth it. The portion sizes are large, and you will never leave hungry. Love the little gift shop with all the neat things to look at. We always talk about buying little things but seen to forget after we are so full.

Started out with phenomenal customer service.  We were escorted to our room by the woman from check in.  Nice personal touch.  The room itself was big. The walls and baseboards were dirty looked like ppl had splattered food or drink it was also very dusty. However it was conformable.  Loved the little kitchen area which included an additional sink outside the bathroom.  The bathroom was not what I would expect from the look of the room. ..the bathroom was old and dirty. There were cracks in the walls and paint peeling from the ceiling which was grossly splattered in what looked to be urine...the tub was peeling and very old it also had mold in the grout. The room itself was great for our needs though. What really gets the stats though is the beautiful atmosphere and landscaping. Green grass throughout, lush trees, bushes, and beautiful flowers. The pool is lovely and looked clean. We did not get to utilize the pool but it was very inviting.  We played bocce ball with our kids and took a lovely walk.  It's quiet and private. There were a couple ppl smoking which was bothersome as when we booked the room the website specifically stated there was no smoking on the grounds/in the rooms/ on the patios.  It made it impossible to leave the room door open and enjoy the beautiful weather. It was irritating as one of the reasons we chose this specific place was that they were non smoking.

I've never been to this hospital but working in the medical field I deal with their staff often. They are always rude and short with you. They often seem scattered and unorganized...they will put you on hold with out saying a word, and the operator does not have a list of hospital staff or a hospital directory so they are unable to perform the transfer duty they are there to perform in the first place. Even if you give the operator the name of the person/employee you are looking for they have no way of transfer. I personally thought that's what an operator does. She will also aggressively tell you how it's your problem and there's nothing she can do for you then transfer toy to the wrong place just to get you out of her hair. I would never go here based on the interaction with current staff. What poor customer service.

This place is just ok... There's really not much to say. Food is just ok...filling, but over all nothing special. Was not impressed with the service...We waited forever for everything even water refills. It wasn't even busy.... I do like the chips and salsa.

I have been here twice now. The first time I had an amazing prenatal massage, a facial and a pedicure. Amazing experience. All of the attendants were very nice and the atmosphere was relaxing.  I recently went back and cut off my hair. It was going to be a HUGE change. I had not cut my hair in 7years. Emily made me feel excited and comfortable about the change. She was so sweet and eager to fix anything I didn't like... This place is the best.

I would have given 3 or 4 stars but the employees sit by the front door and smoke cigarettes. So gross. Also pretty sure there is a law you have to be 20ft from the door. Very gross and unprofessional. Plus this is a pharmacy and should promote health not poisoning yourself and others. Also since they changed their hrs it is not as convinient. However the employees are usually very polite and it's always clean inside...it's a pretty busy pharmacy, but they are usually very nice and helpful.

This place was so gross. We took the kids bc they are still just a bit too young to all go to the theater. I was disgusted by the filth not only of the lots but of the concession stand and especially the bathrooms. The quality of people that were there was disturbing. People drinking and being loud (adults not children) there were minor children who were unattended and clearly not old enough to be watching after themselves.   I was excited to take my kids as this was something I remember as a child being so exciting. I cherished the memories and wanted to share with my kids and help them create their own memories. It was definitely not worth it. The price was right but it makes me think...I suppose you get what you pay for...filth, disgusting people around you, and overall disappointment. The concessions were way over priced and clearly that money doesn't go to keeping the place kept up. What a joke this place is.

We have eaten here several times and often order delivery which is great because we don't have a lot of good delivery our this way. Very convenient. The food is always good and service is always excellent. We love the meatball trio and the Davinci sandwich. The anti pasto salad is also delicious with the house dressing. Every pizza we have tried has been amazing. Love their sauce and crust. The only thing we have had that is not great are the wings they are soggy, chewy, and kinda bland...

This place is decent. We are in the restaurant the first time which was ok.no one was particularly helpful our friendly but the food was good (this was when the first opened) then we found out they delivered. Places get mucho points for delivery and it's near impossible to go it to eat with 3 kids who are 3yrs as under. So we called and they informed they were not delivering that night...so we didn't order at that time...The hostess on the phone was not very apologetic and kinda rude. We tried again after purchasing a Groupon. Once again they were not delivering. The hostess said they were too busy to deliver to us. We ordered take it and had my husband go pick it up. The food is quite good...The pulled pork is my fave as well as the sausage. Haven't found a side that I really like yet. When my husband picked up the food they would only honor half of or Groupon. They said Groupon had made a mistake and they wouldn't honor the full price only hall and to save the other half for a second purchase. So we did and had to order again that next month before the Groupon expired. We called again to check if they were delivering. They were not...The hostess said o well we are under staffed right now so we are not delivering... A few days later I tried again. This time they were delivering and we used the remaining Groupon. Most likely won't be going back or ordering again. The stars come from food and flavor, but free rude staff and exuses about delivering were quite agitating. It's sad coz they really have potential. Better than the place next door (right next door is Rudys) their loss though they could have had some regular customers.

Lovely service.  But more than that the food was delish. Full of flavor and cooked to perfection.  Not too dry. ..some ppl make shwarma very dry but this was on point.  The rice is wonderful.  Seasoned top perfection.  Although drink choices are limited water works just fine to compliment the great food. The presentation was beautiful and really shows a chef who cares about his kitchen.  And kosher top boot so I can eat here with my grandmother and mother.

My husband and I went here once before it was pretty good I had a burger and my husband had the NY strip. We are having a cheat week on our diet and we decided to order carry out today.We live close enough that everything was still warn when we got home. The spicy chicken bites were good and the sweet sauce they come with. The salad was a tad small...I would think lettuce would be something that would be given not so sparingly. My husband gas a rather tummy chicken tortilla soup. My husband once again got the strip...It was very well done (he ordered medium) I tried the filet also very very well done (I ordered medium also) it was so over that it was actually chewy and tough. I didn't know a filet could be tough. It looked more like the sirloin it was so thin. So not impressed. I'm thinking next time we will go across the street to outback. The good items don't out weigh the bad. With having so many steak houses in the immediate area as competition you would think they would step it up to keep or win their customers.

Service here sucked. They were so slow. We had a large group and could tell they couldn't handle that. The only changing table for the baby was in the family restroom. I waited outside the restroom (I checked the stalls in the main bathroom. Most of which were empty. After waiting to change my baby's diaper a single girl came out of the family bathroom. Clearly not a family or anyone with a baby. Just some intoxicated girl. The hostesses who are all located by the restrooms didn't even notice they were all too busy gossiping with each other. Worst buffalo wild wings I've ever been to. The food was sub part and the drinks were weak. My water was constantly empty. Choose a diff buffalo wild wings they have so many other locations that are better.

I tried this place coz is neat my house.  They had a coupon for a 99 cent coffee I figured I would use it to try it out see if it was any good. When we entered the decor is fun and artsy. The customer service was OK.  My friend and I each got a coffee. He said his was alright. .. mine was watery and blah.  I could live without this place since dunking and Starbucks are both within the same mile.

We did an online order for take out. I loved that they had vegan options!  I enjoyed a very tasty tofu,spinach, mushroom scramble w/sweet potato hash. Delicious and full of flavor. My husband enjoyed a meaty scramble. We were even able to get all three of our kids a meal and not have them share; since their prices were very affordable. My girls enjoyed the whole grain dollar pancakes, French toast and scrambled eggs. The pancakes were a hit and the eggs. Over all a great food experience. My husband who picked up the meal even got a picture of the easter bunny at the location to show the kids.

We tried this place as it is new to Chandler, and we love to try new places. Honestly after reading some of the other reviews I was worried about poor service. However or server Heather (I think that was her name...pregnancy brain disrupts my memory) was great! She kept or glasses full and the food came in a timely manner. Our appetizer chips and queso was delicious, and the mango tea even better!! I had the lunch combo half sandwich/wrap abd two sides. I went with the buffalo chicken wrap. The flavor was there, hoping for a tad more buffalo sauce, abd the bedding in the chicken was somewhat soggy and falling off but over all the flavor was good. For sides I tried the tortilla soup not the best I've had. The loaded baked potato side was most definitely loaded. It was my favorite part of the dish. My husband had the chicken tenders and steak other than the soggy onion strings his meal was delish! Over all good experience.

We first ordered from here for delivery.  Which was great because there are no other sandwich deliveries in the area.  We liked it so much that the following week we stopped in for a quick bite.  The staff was friendly and everything is delicious.

We had a little staycation in Scottsdale and this place was recommended by yelp reviews.  They did not disappoint!  I was so greatful for the vegetarian options (specially for a bbq place) I had a quinoa burger which had cheese and Avocado on it.  Loaded with flavor! ( I'll order it without the bun next time. ..too much of the same textures)  The fries were good (soggy since we ordered take out,  but good) my husband stated all the meats he tried were delicious. (Pulled pork, chicken,  and beef) the kids and hubby loved the baked beans. They said they had a sweet start and finished fresh making you feel like they really put love into making them.

After arriving we got seated right away even though it appeared to be busy. We waited several min for a server but when she arrived she was attentive and took our order quickly. I asked for an iced tea and never received a refill (except of water) our food came out before our beverages from the bar. ( an mmm mmm mosa, and a dirty drunken chai) the bar tender /manager had gotten distracted but promptly brought our drinks and we were apologized to and it was taken off our bill. It was very nice and thoughtful of our wait. The food was well worth the wiat. I had a B.E.A.T sandwich it was delicious. The aoli was so flavorful the bread had a perfect crunch and the bacon cooked nicely. My hubby ordered the breakfast potpie  he said it was delicious, the crust was perfectly flakey and the sausage gravy full of flavor with a  nice, creamy texture. We were very pleased with our visit here the food was very good and the customer service was exceptional.
