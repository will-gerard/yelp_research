I'm not sure which location the arrangement came from but a beautiful bouquet was delivered to my parents house while I was there from the nicest man!! he said he was sorry for out loss and even made mention of a "grampa" bein a "big loss" which made me smile. then as he gave me a little hug he prayed a quick prayer and said his family would keep our family in their thoughts and prayers. I thought it was the nicest thing ever and so personal!!! thank u whoever u are!! and the bouquet that came from my moms wrk friends was gorgeous!!!

I stayed here from Friday until Monday of this last week. oct 2-5, 2015. Our experience was ok the first day then when we called up front to let them know the a/c was not cooling the room, they changed the air filter without looking at it or anything. next day same thing a/c was not cooling room. We were able to switch rooms the last night into one of the suites where the a/c worked beautifully. but much to our dismay we left a couple clothing articles (very expensive) that when we called and asked about them there was supposedly a "lost and found" that I guess the maids do not use. so basically they stole our things when they realized or thought we had checked out . besides all that the only other issue was the cafe restaurant next to the buffet downstairs ..... orders came out wrong then when we finally got our food we had to wait even longer to talk to a manager much less par our bill. I would not recommend staying here nor would I ever stay here again. a staff full of thieves is enough for me

as I'm reading each review I see I am not alone in wanting to warn you DO NOT MOVE IN HERE!!!   I moved in last July and things started the day I moved in. No one had called to inform me that there was still money needed down that they didn't realize wasn't on the application! (office couldn't get ahold of mngr for awhile so we sat there until they did instead of being able to move in) now 9months latr I can't wait to move out in July!   i was in office the other day listening to residents complain that their apt smells like cat pee every time it rains .a few months back my toilet over flowed thru the back part and it took maintenance (so much for emergency number) almost 2 hrs when I called at 8pm. they would not replace the carpet even tho the water had been sitting in the entire bedroom bathroom and front entry for 2 days at least. and when u would walk back in the apt it would smell like sewage. they brought in huge blowers for 3 days and when I asked about my sleeping arrangement they said maybe I could stay w a neighbor!!!! It could b mold infested as we speak!!  no one would keep me posted on the progress or let me know when carpet people were coming I would just come back home and people were in there. I finally had to call the manager of all the pillar properties to finally get some answers and only then did Tracey fly into some half ass action!!!!   they don't inform u each time they let themselves into a unit! I hav had miantanence enter while I'm giving therapy sessions out of my home!!! they don't tell u that century link is an option over cox bcuz they get a kickback from cox but I hav researched and used both and century link actually has the stronger signal and less issues and lower monthly bill!!!!   I called the last 3 days to the office to ask about my rent total because yet again I received no water bill in the mail!! and I also have a screen door that came off the track. I haven't had a call back (it's Friday now so I'm sure my messages will b lost in the wknd ) nor does anyone ever answer the phone up there!!     three times since July I hav had pkgs come thru the post office... (which they deliver to office automatically instead of knockin on ur door w it first) and two were supposed to come at a time. they would lose one for a few days making me call the post office or saying the post office lady never delivered it, adding that she "usually checks em as delivered b4 they are actually here w us" .... only to finally go back in on Monday (after the mail lady tells u "they do this all the time! I delivered it , they have it") and they search again and go "oh here it is! it was here the whole time!"   my freezer froze over one time and leaked in the kitchen everywhere from the ice maker and the first guy covering the wknd shift told me just to unplug the water thing from the back of the fridge til Monday! I didn't kno what he meant so a few hours later after I kept having to use towels to keep it from leaving the tiny kitchen he came and did not fix it but unplugged it!!! when I finally got someone to come on Monday the nice white haired guy came n fixed it and then asked why the wknd guy didn't just fix it? I told him he had said to unplug it til Monday to which the guy told me he does that alot to get out of work!! (so why is that guy still workin for the pillars then? because this is the work ethic of most the staff)     now don't even get me started about the pool area!!! if it's working (when I moved in in July the pool water was about 85Â° , and most the time filled with dirt and debris from all the Unmanicured  lawn and trees)  anytime after 5pm u cannot go down there with children because there are obnoxious loud trashy people getting wasted and listening to music that the whole pool area has to listen to as well! They stay out there as late as possible sometime even after the pool is closed (which I noticed they hav started chaining the gates shut which looks like south Phoenix ghetto in Scottsdale) and most people don't even bother going to the pool now except these few that I evn know have been getting 10day move out notices which they never follow thru with!!!  I used to live here about 7 or 8 yrs ago and I'm sad that I moved back!!! since management has changed the whole place has gone to shit!!! I'm surprised people r still renting here!! don't make the same mistake I did!! they have cheaper move in deals for a reason!!! it's seriously bringing an apt complex that used to be at least an 8 down to a 1 or 2 :( !!! SAVE URSELF!! LIVE FAR FROM THIS PLACE!!

ordered a plant/flower arrangement from 1800flowers and for 90$ I am appalled at the arrangement that was sent to the funeral home!! the basket it came in looked like it came from the dollar store , was about 9inches in diameter and a cheap white bow on top!!! for a funeral!! I called to tell them about it , was luckily given half my 90$ back but I would've given it back for all my money back!!! as far as the plant I am going to have to repot it because a day later parts of it are already wilting!! and I'll have to put it in something that doesn't look like an Easter basket that even a kid didn't want!!!

the employees were nice but I have never been somewhere where they take X-rays that are so Half assed that they don't know if I hav a fracture or not. what kind of diagnosis is 'u have a possible fracture' ?!?!  then , they should hav wrapped my elbow that night but instead called me the next day  to come back in for a splint!!!  or the girl asked if I had an ace bandage lying around and suggested I could just wrap my arm myself!!  so I went to the 32nd and greenway location for my soft cast and the guy there could not believe she told me to wrap it myself

Today was my second Dermaplane with Tammy Robinson! I have been a little nervous and Tammy has made me feel comfortable each time! She is gentle yet quick with the procedure and my skin feels so soft and clean afterwards!! I would recommend anyone wanting to try this for the first time  or that has done it before to make an appointment with Tammy soon!!! She also did my eyeliner and contour with the prettiest turquoise ever!! she also corrected old permanent brows that got messed up and now they actually look like my eyebrows only better!!!
