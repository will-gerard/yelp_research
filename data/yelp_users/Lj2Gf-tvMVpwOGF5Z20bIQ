I've actually known Ide since the late 80's (I hate to even type that!) but she's never done my hair! After receiving a terrible cut at Paul Mitchel The School, I ran to Ide who immediately admonished me for "Going THERE!!". She admitted my hair was now a challenge, but the final cut she gave me is stunning! I can't write enough about how much I love it...and her! I strongly recommend Ide Mania! Trust me, you'll receive total care and attention!

My  ex-hubby and I used to frequent this place in 1991 when it was called The Lone Star. It was awesome then...and it's still just as awesome!!! I moved away for 20 years and when my ex-mother-in-law came into town we decided to give Texaz Grill a try, not even thinking that it was the same place.   Boy! Were we pleasantly surprised!!  Nothing has changed! Not the decorations, not the menu, not the friendly staff, not the quality of the food...NOTHING!!! Ok. I'm lying. There was a different picture on the back of the ladies room door.  We all ordered the Ribeye with the house salad/house dressing, homemade mashed potatoes and cream gravy. I've dreamt about those mashed potatoes!! The steaks were perfect! Juicy, tender, flavorful, cooked to order. Chain steakhouses have NOTHING on this place!  We finished our meal with the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Trust me, you've never had bread pudding so good! Full of cinnamon, raisins, and pecans with the most delightful whiskey sauce.  If you live in Phoenix or are just passing through stop in at The Texaz Grill! You won't regret it!

I love Pei Wei!! They offer up some truly tummy Asian dishes! And the awesome thing about it is that no matter which location you go to, the food is consistently the same! My favorite dish is the Kung Pao with tofu, brown rice and extra sauce on the side. Seriously, even folks who don't care for tofu will love this! Thanks Pei Wei for being a mile from my work and easy to get to!!

OMG!  Just moved to the neighborhood a week or so ago and had a craving for fish tacos. I knew this place was up the street so I stopped in on my way home from work. The Fish Taco plate was reasonably priced at $6.19. The little waitress at the drive-thru window was a doll. Asking if I wanted hot sauce I responded that I  wanted the hotest they had.  She gave me both the red and the green telling me that heat was relative and to try both. Fair enough. When I got home and opened the to-go container I was greeted to 2 HUGE tacos and a generous portion if refried beans and rice. I tried the beans first, cause in my book it you can't get the refried beans right the rest if the meal with most likely suck. Lemme tell you...these were the most flavorful refried beans I've ever had! Anywhere. Including my own. This was going to be a great meal!! The fish tacos were made of cod fried in a light batter with pico de gallo, shredded cabbage, and a spicy cream sauce. Heaven! The best I've had since Denver! The meal was so good I finished the entire container, and that never happens. Try this little Mexican place, I can only imagine everything on the menu us this good. And trust me, I will be trying everything!

I've been a regular at Chen Wok for over a year now. I've patiently sat on the sidelines and read some of the more negative reviews here on Yelp. And I finally couldn't hold my tongue any longer.  Is Chen Wok Panda Express? No. It's not. Chen Wok actually puts meat into their dishes that you don't have to use garden shears to eat. Chen Wok's meat is actually tender. Their veggies, like Panda's, are cut fresh daily. They do NOT use MSG, unlike Panda. And I can get a 3 item meal WITH 6 plump, overfilled crab/cream cheese puffs for UNDER $10.00!!!  Is it the best Chinese food? It's better, by far, than Panda Express...but not at all in the same league as Chicago and New York's China Town fare. But that's ok...we're in ARIZONA. And I'd much rather give my money to a locally owned business than Corporate Butt Weasels any day.  Items ordered off their menu are plentiful, tasty, price-worthy, and of a better quality than their Panda-like line AND they deliver! Which is especially awesome due to the light rail construction on 19th & Northern.  The folks behind the counter are also very nice. I've never had a bad experience with Chen Wok and I'll continue to eat there as long as I'm in the area.  Give them a chance. Your other alternative is Wahsun across the street...and it's a crap shoot as to whether they'll be open or not.

Been going to Bailey's for the last six months. It's an older crowd during the day, but at night and on the weekends the crowd id much younger! Bartenders are all friendly and the drinks are cheap, though they could be stronger. I highly recommend it!

When I wrote the original review I was dating the enormously overweight bouncer, Tim, and didn't know what Yelp was all about at the time. I do now. Bailey's is a dive bar, it's true...and there can be good dive bars, but this isn't one of them. There were a few bartenders there that I was fond of, but otherwise don't waste your night. The raw sewage smell is overwhelming, terrible tragic bar flies buzzing around for their next 'relationship', preferential treatment for whomever is kissing whomever's ass of the moment, tap beer and soda tastes of mildew...imagine one of those black velvet paintings then smear dirt on it and turn it into a bar. 'Nuff said. Walk right on past Bailey's.

I would LOVE to tell you that the shrimp with lobster sauce is out of this world! I would enjoy waxing poetic about the jumbo size of Wahsun's eggroll's! It would please me to no end to tell you about how sweet Rose is!  But I can't.  Why?  Because they were closed at 6:35 pm on a Wednesday evening even thought their sign on the front window boasts "OPEN EVERYDAY 11:00 - 10:00'.  This is the 2nd time that this has happened to me. The first time was a little over a week ago around 2:00 pm as I was leaving the Sprouts that's in the same strip mall, I glanced over at Wahsun, but they looked closed. Now, to their advantage...they ALWAYS look closed.  I spent about 30 minutes the other night reading the 39 reviews here on Yelp about how incredible the food is and was impressed with the loyalty of established customers as well as the raves from the new/first time customers. I've thought about Wahsun ever since.  I'm a massage therapist and after working on 7 people during my day I'm pretty hungry. I immediately drove to the restaurant...didn't stop at home...didn't run any errands...only to find the place and and no aromas wafting seductively from the building...unless you count the Pizza Hut a few doors down, but YUCK!  I'm from New York and good Chinese food is difficult to find in Arizona...and I guess I still haven't found it. To say that I'm disappointed would be a gross understatement.  So here I sit, in front of my laptop, eating a quesadilla from Pollo Loco and feeling completely unsatisfied.  Will I give Wahsun one more chance? Yea...I will. And ONLY because of the rave reviews here. If they hadn't been so good I'd finally resign myself to Pei Wei.  Better luck next time I guess!

Man...I cannot win for losing with this place! After my disappointment 9 days ago, I decided to give it another try. When I walked in there were 4 occupied tables and no clearly visible direction of where to go to order take out. But at the back of the restaurant there were two red tablecloth covered tables (and pretty filthy tableclothes, I might add) and there were 2 men standing to the right of one with a very harried looking asian lady running back and forth between asking diners if they needed to-go boxes, delivering food, taking orders, and making change. I asked the man in front of me what was going on? He grabbed a few xeroxed menu copies from one of the tables and handed them to me, explaining that he'd been standing there for awhile and hadn't yet ordered himself. Wow... When the waitress (could this possibly be the infamous Rose?) slowed down long enough we found out there would be an hour wait on all take out orders!  I didn't want to wait an hour, that's for sure. She told me to take my menus and call ahead next time...then breathlessly muttered, "Happy New Year..." So...I will try again.  This place had better be worth the wait or I'm just gonna go across the street to Chen Wok next time!

Third times a charm...right?  No.  I took the day off from work today to get some errands done and at around 1:30 pm I found myself at Sprouts which is in the same strip mall as Wahsun, so I thought I'd give it a go...again. And I was once again let down. At lunchtime, on a Thursday, Wahsun was closed. At least this time there was a large CLOSED sign on the front window.  I don't know how this place stays in business, I honestly don't. I wanted so badly to be able to come back here and write a stellar review, but inconsistency won out. A business should adhere to the business hours posted...or at least keep regular business hours. The food might be out of this world, but I'll never know.  You lost my business Wahsun. Not that you ever gave me the chance to be your customer, but now I never will be.  I can only warn folks to call first before you try to dine here. I only live a few blocks away, so it wasn't that big of a deal to be disappointed three times. But for those who may be drawn here by the good reviews...CALL FIRST and save your gas...just in case.

Whoa...a little rice bowl establishment that harkens me back to the original Tokyo Express circa 1985!! I got the chicken teriyaki (dark meat ), tofu salad and tekka Mali (raw tuna ) rolls. The rice in the teriyaki bowl was sticky ( the way it should be! ) the chicken was moist, the teriyaki sauce was PERFECT!! The tofu salad rocked...light and lemony, and the tekka maki was perfection! I informed the happy, smiling man behind the counter that I'd be coming back often. Seriously, if you're ever near this place, stop in. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Easily the WORST Pho I've ever had! And that speaks volumes!  The broth was salty and the meat was grisly...ewwww...  I was pretty much ignored as well.  I want to like Pholicious, I really do! Partly because it's directly across the street from where I work, but after giving it 2 tries I just cannot bring myself to endorse it.  Sad really...

This is the second time that I've had my hair cut at this school. First time...not so good. The student was preoccupied with fellow students, no one listened to what I wanted, and the instructor was the one who essentially gave me my haircut. But hey...whaddya want for $12!?  This last time was nearly perfect!!! The student, Jordan, listened to everything that I told her! The instructor, Shirley, was helpful and encouraging, and the outcome was I received the cut that I asked for!!! My only problem was that it took 5 hours to cut and color my hair, and 3/4 of the way thru they switched out Jordan with a student who was not so good. Sweet...she was sweet as pie, but she lacked confidence and wasn't really sure of what she was doing.  Be aware also that while you can pay with a credit/debit card, you CANNOT put a tip on either one of them, so bring cash.  If you choose Paul Mitchell School or ANY hair school, go into it knowing that these are students and that your hair does in fact grow back. You're there as a learning tool and about 80% of the time you'll have a great experience!  And if you go during the day, ask for Jordan! She really is very good!!

After 9 days I realized the cut I received was a horrendous disaster! And the haircolor used bled off onto my pillow EVERY night since!!  In a pinch I wouldn't ever use this place for my hair ever again! Boo!!

I recently went to Rice Paper with a friend. I'd never been there before, but thought about going in quite a few times. We were greeted warmly by the staff and sat at the bar where we ordered wine and a few appetizer's...garlic noodles and spicy asian rolls. The noodles would have made my italian grandmother stand up and take notice. Good sized bowl of noodles mixed thoroughly with a sweet/hot garlic sauce. It's a good thing I'm single! The spicy asian rolls were full of asian sausage, imitation crab meat, siracha and jalapeno peppers wrapped in heaven! My only complaint was that there were only two!! Now that I know what kind of fare Rice Paper has to offer, I'll be back to try their Pho...I'm sure I won't be disappointed!

A friend of mine told me that Rehab Burger Therapy was better then 5 Guys.  Yeah...right.  But I thought I'd give it a try. So my best friend and I went down on a Tuesday afternoon.  What a cute place! It reminded me of a place I bar-tended at in Florida! Very relaxed, reggae on the speakers...awesome! Our waitress was the best! I didn't get her name (and I meant to!) but she was knowledgeable, entertaining, and patient with us...and super fast, though we were there at around 3:30 PM in order to avoid any rush.  I ordered the Know Poblano Burger (Relapse size) on a pretzel bun with the Sweet PoTOToes...it was out of this world!! Cooked to order, in this case medium, and covered in these spicy, grilled onions and a HUGE poblano pepper!! Our waitress brought us each 2 different dipping sauces as well...Spicy Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli. Both were excellent on my Sweet PoTOToes, which are sweet potato tater tots!!  My bestie ordered the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger (Rehab size) on a pretzel bun with the skin on, homemade/cut fries. He LOVED his burger so much I think he bgan a serious relationship with it!!  For dessert (we really ARE pigs!) we shared a Pot Brownie...O...M...G...!!! Two brownies with marshmallow cream in between, baked, and coated with Hershey's Sauce!! It could not have gotten any better!!  This place is a gem! We adored EVERY minute of our time there and we will most definitely be back...as many times as our waist sizes allow!!

I work in this area every Friday, and every Friday I go to Paradise Bakery or the new Wildflower location for a salad. I decided to try Which Wich to break out of my routine.  I shouldn't have.  It wasn't the unique way to order your sandwich (on a preprinted paper bag), it wasn't the 15 minute wait to get my sandwich, it wasn't the employees...it was the sandwich.  Now, let me say, the bread that my sandwich was on was excellent! It was soft and chewy and crusty...GREAT bread! And the quality of the meat (I had turkey) was phenomenal! But...I needed my glasses to actually FIND the meat! Literally had to go searching for it. I also ordered avocado (for an extra charge) on my sandwich, and it was a spread, not slices. The caramelized onions I had added were tough and unpleasant as well, and the 'spicy' mayo was absent. I was more than a little disappointed.  I paid $10.18 for a 7 inch sandwich, chips and a drink. I usually pay a little under $10.00 for my salad from Paradise or Wildflower, and I take half home. I was expecting so much more from Which Wich, and received so much less.  I'll stick to my usual lunch spots.

Best place to get a new hairstyle! Danton has been cutting and styling my hair now for a year and I've never had a better stylist! He instinctively knows what I want!  Beautiful, more mature salon...great prices!
