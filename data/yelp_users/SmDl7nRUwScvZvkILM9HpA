This place makes no sense.....you walk in and there are servers, but there is also pick up window, also a register where you can order food. Do I sit down or order at the counter? I ordered at the counter, $10.00 for a bagel sandwich and fries seemed a bit high price. There are no lunch specials or combos. I ordered the roast beef on a jalapeño bagel ( They call this a jalapeño bagel.... Are you kidding me?) food was meh. There is also a bar in back where you can order drinks. At a bagel shop? This place is just going in way too many directions for me.  I don't recommend this place at all. Gave it 2 stars instead of one simply cause the food wasn't all that bad.

How can anyone rate this 2 stars let alone 5? Walked in and the place was oozing with garbage! Look over the counter and there is dirt and grime everywhere. Lady had no clue how to do math helping us. I had a buy one get one free coupon for smoothies and she couldn't figure out how to deduct one smoothie and tried overcharging me 3 times before I had to tell her the total. The donut we tried was fine but the smoothie and cookie and cream iced drink was horrendous! I will never go back to this trash bucket.

Fuddrucker's is fantastic! Have no idea what these people are saying about roaches and crumbs on the carpet (blah blah blah) burgers are delicious and the buns are even better!

Overrated. Boring sandwiches, meh...salads. Cookies are soft but made with way to much shortening. Overall very unsatisfactory.

Ordered the #1. Burger was delicious. Patties are super thin...... never had a patty like this before.....loved it! Shoestring fries were were crispy and well seasoned. Root beer was not mixed properly, but who cares since the food was so damn good! I definately  recommend eating here!
