When I walked in I was already pissed about how I was treated at Finish Line so I'm sure the sales rep could tell I was in an irritated mood. He let me look around and stayed at a distance, when he noticed I was ready for help he was right there for me. No high presser sales and very knowledgeable YOU GUYS ARE TRUE CHAMPS.

When they didn't have my size I asked if they could call the Metro store. When he was on hold for less the a minute a different customer asked for some help, he hangs up goes to help that person. When I ask what they said he tells me they didn't answer that he has to help these ppl then he'll call back. - went to Champs and they were a 10 on service and didn't get the sales person commission feel. (If you aren't buying I'm not helping)

I got the Blackened One BurritoÂ® and was pleasantly surprised. I would give them 5 stars but I waited 11 minutes for my food. (Yes I time people) I could tell they sent all their cooks home but one, I'm thinking because its Sunday during a football game isn't the busiest. Restaurant felt and looked very clean and people were friendly even with my inpatients. I will go back.

I walk in take a seat at the sushi bar as I was writing what i wanted on my sushi card card. A couple walked in sat down next to me. The bar tender associate immediately rushed them octopus sashimi. As I continued to wait, I renewed my registration on-line. While this was happening I noticed him making a shrimp tempura roll which just by chance Is what I ordered 15 mins prior. NOPE I WAS WRONG!!! It went to the couple that had just sat down next to me. Sushi was fair not great and I paid $25 for 2 rolls not bad... but for the quality of service NOT GOOD. If I ever go back I will just make sure I go with regulars too get good service.

Food was great! Its to bad the girl taken my order wasn't. She was annoyed when asked the price difference between a meal and just getting A sandwich. God forbid she had to use her brain to do some math.

I like! Owners have a great personality. If you're really hungry probably not the best spot. It's a little pricy for the amount of food but the food you do receive is GREAT.

I've been here several times and I gotta tell you the ribs are amazing. The few times I've been lucky enough to be seated in Shelly's section I'm treated like a king. Thanks again!!

I've been here several times but this time I roll up and see a big sign that says under new management. I can tell you that the change is very noticeable. I was very impressed by the sushi, atmosphere and the kindness of the waiter and waitress here. I'LL BE BACK!!
