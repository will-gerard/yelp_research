Been coming here since 2002. Consistently delish. The new renovations are great for the family.   Every time I've come lately they haven't had carrots and jalepenos. I miss them. Bummer.

I was nervous to bring my son (4 y.o) to the dentist because he hadn't been since he was 2, but everyone was so nice and patient with him (front desk, hygienist, and dentist). They took their time with him and didn't do anything he wasn't comfortable with. It was a very good experience and I'm glad we found this office! They even sent my son a card in the mail afterwards with a sweet note in it and some fun stickers. They really go above and beyond here, and I highly recommend them.

The worst people to let near your car! They rip you off and to a terrible job! Only come here if you enjoy throwing your money away. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!! Been here four times and finally learned my lesson! Avoid at all costs or it will cost you!

My family and I have been coming to Yupha's for more than 15 years and have never been disappointed.   Most recently I had Yupha cater a lunch at the office for 60 people. The food, which was very plentiful, was loved by all. Just as good as eating in the restaurant.   I highly recommend this place as the beat Thai food around!

Just the worst! In a bind because a two year old neeeeeeded some pizza stat! $4.41 for a tiny slice of terrible pepperoni pizza! WTF. You would have a better experience if you literally ate the money you would have spent. Seriously. Garbage. I can't even handle this. I've had better freezer burned pizza for a dollar of managers special frozen pizza from the grocery store.   The staff was nice though.

I checked in online and arrived when it said to. I was in and out in a half hour or less, with no waiting involved. The staff was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. I was worried about bringing my toddler there but they were great with her and very nice. I'm sure we will be back the next time her dr is closed.

First visit, this place seems great.   I'm so sick of scamming auto repair shops, I wish I was willing to write out the problems I've had with dishonest places but I'm sure you've seen it all too.   I needed a minor service and was looking for a new place in the area since I've had bad luck at other shops. They got me in same day, stayed within the timeframe they said they would and was very competitive on price. When I picked it up they didn't try to sell me on anything I didn't need, refreshing.   I think the gentleman who assisted me was the owner, Keith. He really seemed knowledgable, nice and honest.   I expect I will be back here again for the things I can't do on my own.

My family loves Cafe Rio. I have been to a dozen locations between AZ and UT many many times through many years. I can say without question this is by far the WORST location I have been to.   I have eaten at this location many time, picked up to go and the company I work for has been catered several times. I keep coming back because my family doesn't give me much option as it is convenient.   When dining in at this location you will notice that the place is filthy, from the chairs and tables to the floor and bathrooms, even the outside seating is bad. I always get concerned when an establishment that sells food lacks policies to maintain cleanliness, does this extend to personal hygiene?   The staff are fine, no big issues here, seems like it is just run poorly overall - maybe managers are the issue?   Most recently, today, we had a large order of food catered to the office. So many issues here. When you cater through Cafe Rio, it is done in a good way, you basically put together a purchase order for what you want. It seems like there would be little room for error here. Somehow this method is not working. Without fail, this location is late. Food is never ready on time. Ever. Additionally, despite the reminding them of issues in the past, they STILL forgot several items ordered. Today several of the dishes seemed cold (cheese in enchiladas were not melted, cold) and carelessly made (wraps seemed like they were made many hours earlier, not fresh) as well. Overall very disappointing. The past times we catered for the office, it was always the same issue. Repeatedly forgetting items and ALWAYS late. Additionally no effort is made to make restitution for the many errors.   This food has so much potential. This could be a great location. But, presently, it is not. I would not expect our office will be ordering here any longer, and I hope my family will not force me to go on location either.  The queso is good though. But I assume that's hard to mess up.

So. The Ahi burger was delicious. Nicely seared, not overcooked. The burger was juicy and the bun was pleasantly sweet.  Why do people skimp on fries? I've never understood this. It's the least expensive thing on the planet, you might as well load me up so I'm satisfied. They were thin and crispy and plenty of different sauces to appease any craving.   I wouldn't rave about this place but I expect I'll be back here at some point to try the Thai shrimp burger.

Definitely worth a visit to try their unique selection of donuts. Their croissant donuts are delicious and the creams that they use on top and inside their cream filled donuts are all hand made by them right there in the store. The owners are really nice and provide great service. We will definitely be back!

We kept hearing about this place at random, people talking in the grocery store, IG etc. so we looked it up to satisfy a craving for some good ol' healthful fried food.   We got the fried clams and hush puppies to go. They were heavenly. Good batter on the clams with great spice and the hush puppies had a great balance of spice and fried goodness.   While in the restaurant, the staff were great and the atmosphere and layout seemed very comfortable.   We will be back to try the rest of the menu!
