There is only one reason why I would not give this place "5" stars.  It's only because they should reconsider naming the place "Grandma's B!t@hin' The food is really good but the owner likes to come around and complain about past customers while you eat.  It's kind of off putting.  Otherwise, everyone is really nice.  The atmosphere is more than pleasant and you can't beat the breakfast.

I'll start with the positives.  .... oh wait, there weren't any.  I can't even do a good analysis of the food because the wrong pizza was brought out and to boot it was a pizza we didn't particularly care for.  (Had an ingredient on it that my dining partner had a slight allergy to.) In short, completely horrible service, rude attitudes when trying to get our order straightened out, and owner/manager was unwilling to give a decent conciliation for our trouble.   Will never return.  Being treated like we were is unacceptable, especially when we acted civil and to the point.    Here is a list of follies that occured during our "experience" at Mama Gina's.   1.  Ordered an appetizer.  Was convinced by our waitress to try the garlic knots instead, only to find out when our food arrived 35 minutes later that they didn't even have any to bring out.  Sidenote:  After about 20 minutes we inquired on the whereabouts of this item to our waitress (20 minutes for some garlic bread is a little much) and she said she would go check...apparently that didn't happen. 2.  Wrong Pizza delivered to the table.  After inquiring about the order since it was taking quite awhile to arrive and we had a movie to catch.  The wrong pizza was brought out.  We had ordered a 16 inch BBQ Chicken pizza and a 20 inch Supreme was delivered to our table.  Honestly, it wasn't till 15 seconds after it was dropped off that we went... uh.. wait a minute... this isn't what we ordered.  Immediately went to find our waitress to let her know.  She went to her manager and they said they could make us the right one but we'd have to wait.  Pending our time issue with the movie, this wasn't an option.  Since we couldn't wait for another pizza to come out the manager said we could either take a 20% discount on the pizza or just leave and not pay.  At this point, we were starving and the movie was starting in 10 minutes.  Didn't really have a choice at this point.  I agreed to the 20% discount so we could at least have something to eat before we sat for another 2 hours without food.  (Side note:  couldn't eat much considering one of the items on the supreme includes an item that my date has a slight allergy to.) 3.  Wrong discount.  Once the bill came, we were charged for the pizza that came to our table.  Which was $9 more than what we originally ordered.  Making even the 20% discount they were offering a total more than what we were expecting to pay in the first place.  Waitress ended up paying for our beverages to help offset the cost.  Also, when speaking to the manager, he said we should have let him know sooner that there was an issue.  How were we to know???  The only thing we knew prior to the food coming out was that it was taking FOREVER to get to the table.  ... and that we did bring to their attention.    I truly dislike writing reviews that are this scathing but I just couldn't believe how we were treated by the management.  If you are in the service industry, and the mistakes are with your establishment, then do not make the customers feel as if they are the ones at fault.  I just don't believe they tried to make this better for us.

The pizza here is amazing!  Whatever you do, make sure ricotta cheese is one the ingredients on your pizza!  Super friendly staff and they also have deals on a slices :)

It comes with a heavy heart that I have to rate only 2 stars.  I've tried this place twice now and both times the service was horrendous!  I don't really understand why either.  The place isn't that busy and there are quite a few servers walking around.  Both times we waited over 10 minutes and had to flag someone down just to get started with water or even have someone say hello to us. (I want to add that we came after the dinner rush on both occasions.  There were open tables around us.) I feel that is a little excessive of a wait time for a greeting.  Anyway, even after being greeted and drink orders placed, both times we found ourselves lurking around the restaurant in search of help once we were ready to move through the steps of the meal process.  (i.e. order food, refill of water, order another drink, etc.)  The food here is really good and I really was hoping that last time we were here that the bad service was a fluke.  Unfortunately no.  With there being so many restaurants to choose from nowadays.  I don't foresee myself trying this place a third time.  The lack of attentive service has steered me to trying out other places instead.  Not to mention that the food was better on our first visit.  Hope this isn't a trend as well.

Loved this place!  The food was great, service was great, and the atmosphere was awesome!  Came here with a group of 8, at prime dinner time, and was quoted a half hour to 45 minute wait.  Not a big deal for us since we weren't in any hurry.  However, we were pleasantly surprised when seated only after 20 minutes.  Our server was attentive and very nice.  He even split up our checks and let all of us use our Localdines coupons we had!!  Thank you!!  I got the black bean burger and it was amazing!!  Tons of flavor and our server suggested I get the mixed fries of sweet potato and original and that was a great suggestion!!!  A little bit of everything!  We sat inside at a part that looked like a sun room.  It was extremely clean and classy and felt really comfortable with our big group.  The outside looked really nice too but we didn't have a chance to experience that.  Valet parking is complementary in the back between The Vig and CIBO.  Which is a total PLUS!  Parking is so hard to find downtown.  We will definitely come here again!!
