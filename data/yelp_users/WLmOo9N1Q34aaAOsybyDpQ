Good food. Always forget they close at 8pm. Really 8pm on a friday night?

Spent $7,000 on a hot tub. Already needs service and they charged me a $80 trip charge to have their "warranty" rep come look at it. The manufacturer, Desert Spring Hot Tubs also don't care about this at all. Run, don't walk away from this business.

Food quality was sub standard for the money. I ate here for the first time today. The lettuce and spinach was wilted and brown. I had to spit out chicken that had tendon in it. Overall not fresh at all.
