Two and a half words... "gluten-free pasta".  When I was a kid my family would dine out 1x's a week.  My parent's idea of trying new places meant sitting at a different table at the same restaurant.  Once a place got introduced into our dining lives, we went there every week until my dad got pissed off for some odd reason, and we would move on to a different establishment.  Needless to say we ate at Spaghetti Factory many, many, many times.  I have some fond memories from this place.  Fast forward to now, many years later, I learn they have gluten-free pasta.  1 3/4 hours after finding this out, I was sitting at a table ordering gluten-free pasta with meat sauce and sausage.  I was not disappointed.  They use a corn pasta that has a very good consistency and has a very good taste... my non-gf dining partner also ordered it and enjoyed it very much.  The meat sauce was fantastic in a super salty, not healthy kind of way and the sausage... oh the sausage, so good.  Now I realize this place is in no way healthy, authentic, or "italian", but it's a guilty pleasure that many will like.  I especially like the prices and the decor inside, just like it was when I was a kid.  I enjoy this place, for the memories, and now for the gluten-free pasta.  This will be a monthly place for me before first-fridays.  I highly recommend you use their call ahead seating option by phoning in before you come, it will greatly reduce your wait times.

Good food, good service, good price, shitty location.  I had the carne asada plate which came with guac, beans, and corn tortillas.  The tortillas were amazing, the carne asada was above average, as were the beans.  Unfortunately, as good as it was, it's still Mexican food.  Not that I have anything against Mexican food, it just, for the most part, all tastes similar.  Nothing really stood out as AMAZING.  If I'm in the area (god forbid), I'll def. eat there again, but I'm not going to drive from the E. Valley to go here.  Bonus points for having 7-Up in a bottle, made with sugar.

If you like spicy food, this Sichuan spot has your name written all over it!  Known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine, Sichuan food can be described as spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant.   When you are seated, if you are white, they will give you the "Whitey Menu".  Politely ask for the "Zhangguó cài dan" or "Chinese Menu" and you will be presented with a nice, leather bound, menu filled with the best this place has to offer.  I have tasted about 9 dishes from this place and each one was excellent.   A word of warning, their hottest dishes are the "Water Boiled xxxxx" dishes literally drowning in mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and can be a challenge for even the most seasoned spicy food lovers.  I believe they have toned it down a bit (I was actually told this by a 10-year vetran of this spot) and the last time I had it, it was significantly less spicy, but still about a 9 - 10 on a 10pt spicy scale.  Previously it was essentially inedible to my Nordic tongue, this last time it was enjoyable.... so buyer beware.  I was going to go 4 stars, actually about 4.5, but given the fact that there is not a better Sichuan spot in AZ, it gets 5 stars.  Go, eat, enjoy.

So we arrived at 3:30am to a self-parking experience that was less than favorable. There was little to no direction or guidance as to where to park so we were flying blind. We parked in P2, the underground portion since the 30-ish spots they have right in front were taken. We took the elevators up to ground level to find the doors we needed to go through to get to the hotel LOCKED. It took us 20minutes of wandering around to find another way out and to find the hotel entrance. OH, and did I mention that not 1 of the 3 phone numbers I had were staffed by a live person so we couldn't even call to get advice.  30 minutes after arriving, we made it to the front desk. It took us another 45 FUCKING MINUTES before we got a room key. Some dude, resembling a retarded crypt keeper, was trying to help us check in. 15minutes of the crypt keeper staring at the monitor I suggested perhaps he seek assistance. His coworker wasn't much help either and was a complete d0ckle. Neither one of the guys would communicate with us, they just stared and chicken-pecked their keyboards with perplexed looks on their faces. Finally, 45minuites later WITH 0 EXPLANATION OR APOLOGY, we finally received our keys.  Once we finally got to our room, everything was awesome. Room was huge... bigger than some of my friends' L.A. apartments. Seriously. Nice LCD TVs in both the living room and the bedroom. Huge, comfortable, clean, fluffy, comfy bed. Large, nice bathroom.  Our 2 day stay was nice and we really liked our room. For $79/night thanks to groupon, we felt like we got a good deal.

It's 4:00 am on a Friday, you've just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, you're starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerry's.  The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Denny's, better than most diner's I've been to, actually.  I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good.

I enjoy this place.  The barista's are always friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I've only ever had their Chai, hot and cold, so I can only speak to their Chai, but it's tasty.  The shop is large, comfy, and welcoming.  They have a large book wall, I'm not sure if it's a book-swap thinggy or not.  I did get annoyed when one of the baristas insisted on calling a "Soy Chai" a "Choy".. haha.  It just sounded retarded to me.  I, of course, wouldn't dock points for that, just wanted to throw it out there.  Whenever I'm in the area (which is surprisingly frequent) I stop by.

Woah, this place is great!  On my first visit I walked in and was immediately greeted by 4 different "hello"'s, "welcome"'s, and smiling faces.  What a warm welcome right off the bat.  It was a little hard to find, but once you find it, you will be so glad you did.  Their food is amazing!  I have been twice now and have had their pork chops, hot links, and chicken wings, all were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and tasted excellent!  I was a bit hesitant with the hot links, as often they come way too greasy for my taste, but these were grilled to perfection and not overly greasy.  I was very impressed.  I have also tried their dirty rice (spicy and dirty with ground beef, great!), black eyed peas, and their french fries.  The fries were just fries, but seasoned well.... everything else was spot on.  I really enjoyed their dirty rice.  I've had a lot of different types of dirty rice, and this was very unique and very tasty.  Their chicken deserves its own paragraph here.  Seriously.  I order their fried chicken "not battered", so they basically season the chicken and drop it in the deep fryer.  OMFG.  I've eaten my share of fried chicken, but their chicken, by far, is better than anything I have ever eaten..... easy.  In fact, my mouth is literally watering as I type this.  Go, eat their chicken.   The environment was nice... low light, dark decor, great old school tunes being spun by a dj on the 1's and 2's.   Don't worry, if you don't eat wheat or gluten, just tell them and they will make sure your meal is made without, no issues here.  Very accommodating.

This place serves the best BBQ within 5miles of the place I currently spend most of my billing hours.  Certainly better than the BBQ Company on 36th.  I get the 2 meat combo which comes with a side (beans), chips (good chips), and 2 meats of your choice for like $7.50-$8.  I've tried and been impressed with the Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Smoked Ham.  Their meats have a very nice flvor and are served with just a tiny drizzle of bbq sauce, nothing more.  The flavor of the meats speak for themselves, you really don't need bbq sauce, but the drizzle is a nice compliment as opposed to being the main dish as it is at other, gross, bbq places.  Service is quick, efficient, and very friendly.  They have a lot of micro-brew-ish sodas, fresh homemade deserts, and other yummy treats, if that's your thing.

Doesn't look like much from the outside, but serves up awesome food.  On a recommendation from DarrenC, I tried this place.  I drove right past it on my first pass, totally didn't even notice the little stand-alone building sitting back from Broadway in the ghetto.  They have burgers, BBQ, Catfish, sandwiches, etc.  The owner is, apparently, a preacher and likes to blast emotional, uplifting gospel-type music which, surprisingly, adds to the enjoyment of the place, and I am not a fan of church or religion.  Oh, and the best part.... they serve up sweet tea.  If you work around here, just try it, you will be adding it to your rotation, guaranteed.

Every dish I have ever had here has been amazing.  Fragrant, spicy, full of flavor.  As stated before, the service is excellent.  I've tried about 10 dishes here and every time I thought to myself, "god damn this is good!".  They are also very knowledgeable about their food and their ingredients and can customize dishes to your dietary restrictions and/or guide you to a more appropriate dish.  Please be aware that they only serve their full ala carte menu at night, during the day was buffet only and the last time we went they only had 2 dishes which were dairy-free, so we had to bounce, which was super disappointing because I was fiending their food.  Do yourself a favor, if you're a fan of lemonade, and try theirs, it's amazing.

Pretty good Korean food.... IMO.  I lived in Korea Town, Los Angeles for a few years and would walk to our local souju spots and our local Korean BBQ spots with great frequency, so I ate a lot of Korean food.  This place is about as good as the Hodori in Los Angeles, which I would rate 3 stars, but this place gets 4 being in the middle of the desert with little else to compare.  Hodori, LA is literally surrounded by 100 other KBBQ spots.  Anyway, service is whatever..... nothing special, which is to be expected at a Korean establishment.  Sides are pretty good and they are good about refilling them.  Two of us usually share one bbq dish and are perfectly full at the end after devouring the meal with all the sides.  Oh, and a good boba spot is right next door... kbbq then boba, ftw!

I really enjoyed their food.  Their dishes were not prepared in the same 'ole "Americanized Chinese" food that's common around these parts.  I really enjoyed the sauces and the food in general was very good.    It was a very interesting experience for us when the power went out as we were enjoying our soup!  The owners brought candles to our table and kept cooking our dishes (kitchen runs on gas) and bringing them out 1 by one!  We all dined by candlelight and I really enjoyed it.  lol  We had Sizzling Rice Soup, Egg Drop Soup, Dumplings, Mongolian Beef,  Sichuan (aka: Szechwan) Shrimp, and Crispy Duck with some VERY good white rice cooked perfectly... finished off with some fried banana. hao chi !!  The service was very good and friendly and we enjoyed some time chatting it up with the owner at the end.

I love this place, and if you went there, you would love it too.  One of the (many) things I miss about Southern California are the (usually)Charbroiled Burger spots that blanket the entire area from Ventura down to San Diego:  Legends like the o.g. Astro Burger, Galaxy Burger, Douglas Burger, Tam's, etc.   These burger joints served awesome burgers, great grilled sandwiches (Patty Melts, anybody?), and almost always, a great, greasy breakfast on the cheap.  Oh, and they made their food proper.... American Cheese on all burgers and sandwiches, thousand island on the burgers, no up charge for grilled onions, yadda-yadda-yadda, you get the point.  Sadly, AZ seriously lacks in these types of establishments.  Enter Giant Hamburgers.  While their burgers aren't charbroiled, they're wonderful.  Their Grilled Ham and Cheese is out of this world (just remember to order it "plain" with only the ham and cheese on buttery, grilled sourdough... YUM!).  Try an open-faced chili burger, or maybe even a gardenburger, if you like retarded shit.  Their Chili-Cheese fries are a real treat, especially since they melt a few slices of American Cheese on top instead of that bullshit cheddar some places use.  Thirsty for something sweet?  Try a hand-made, uber thick shake.  Still hungry after all that?  Have a jumbo slice of homemade pie.  Wait!  What if it's 9am and your stomach's not ready for Chili Cheese Fries?  No problem, their breakfasts will surely satisfy any cravings you might have.  Sold as a Single, Double, or Triple, their egg combos come with eggs, hash browns, toast, and your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, hamburger patty, bacon, or steak for an additional charge.  Don't want eggs?  No problem, they've got pancakes and the best looking biscuit and gravy plate I've seen in years.  You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you as you're chillin' in 50's-style booths enjoying the music and ambiance of an old school diner.  The place is always busy and the staff is always very friendly, but not in an overly friendly, obnoxious way.  A Triple breakfast plate will set you back about $8 with tax.  Burger, fries, and a drink will get you for about the same.  They are more than willing to substitute or customize your order however you want it, usually at no charge.    You will enjoy this place, trust me.

Excellent, friendly service for a great price. I brought my shoes in and 2 days later they looked BRAND NEW. I would highly recommend this place. They're just 1/2 block south of Main St. by the Nile.

Los Whatever  This place is just a step above *bertos.  Just your standard, run of the mill "Mexican"  food.  Like most Mexican food, it's "OK".  Nothing special here.  I had the carne asada platter with a drink, it came to $9.11.  A conspiracy?  Perhaps.  I don't see what the big deal here is, nor do I understand how anyone with papillae can give this place 5-stars.

This is my new favorite Thai spot.   Ambiance is good, much better than any other E. Valley Thai spot, the service is prompt and very friendly.  We spent about 15 minutes after our meal chatting it up with the owner.  They really make you feel welcome.  The food is excellent. I love Thai food due to the complex flavors that they use in their dishes.  Sweet, savory, spicy, vinegary all come together in a wonderful way.  Mint Thai's flavors are superior and the way their dishes are presented just adds to the eating experience.  I had their Laarb (excellent), Shrimp Red Curry (excellent), Spicy Fried Rice (average... not flavorful), and Mango with Sticky Rice (excellent).  I gave them a pass on the Spicy Fried Rice.  For me, it wasn't flavorful enough.... I should have just splashed some fish sauce on it.  Their other dishes were so good and so much better than other places they still get a 4-star review, even with average fried rice.  I just won't order the Spicy Rice next time.

FINALLY, Mexican food to rave about!  Those that read my reviews know I don't get too excited about Mexican food.  I feel most places do it the same, just "ok".  I never eat Mexican food and think, "omg this is good".... that, is, until now.  LuLu's totally does it for me.  It's a little, unsuspecting taco shop that has daily specials, Mexican drinks/deserts/specialties.  Their prices are not cheap, but not expensive either.  Tacos are $1.50, Red Chili plates are $8.99.  They make everything from scratch, and you can tell by the quality.  Their salsa bar is incredible and they do breakfast.  For those of you who do not eat wheat / gluten, they are knowledgeable about their ingredients and can make dishes such as Red/Green Chili plates without flour, just ask!  Awesome!

Pretty damn good Thai food.  Surprisingly, this place has good food.  I say surprisingly because it's in a strip mall with a Basha's anchor on the corner of Baseline/Greenfield.  In fact, I've driven by it for over 4 years and never noticed it.  Actually, the ONLY reason I noticed it was because from the street, I thought the sign said "Boba Tea" not "Bola Thai".  My initial experience with this place was not pleasant based solely on the fact that I rushed over to check it out, thinking it was Boba and when I found out it wasn't, I got pissed and held it against them and refused to eat there.  haha.  Well, my temper tantrum finally ended and tried it.  What an idiot I am for not eating there sooner, Boba or no Boba.  You walk up and order at the counter, then they bring the food to you.  Their menu is a little weird in the sense that they don't have a lot of items, and do not have the typical Thai dishes.... BUT, they can and will make anything for you.  We had the Laarb (not on menu) and Drunken Noodles, both were delicious.  They've got real Thais working and cooking in the back and the taste shows they know what they are doing.  I saw an old Thai lady in the back with her mortar and pestle making curry. Two dishes cost us $16.00, not super cheap, but not bad and because you order at the counter, I didn't feel compelled to leave a tip.  OH.. yeah, just a warning, their food is spicy.  I know you're thinking, "no duh dude, it's Thai" but what I mean is their scale seems a little hotter than other scales... they do a 1-4.  I usually like my food spicy, sometimes even order it "Thai spicy".  This time I went 3 and it was almost too spicy to enjoy.  Almost.  :)  Just a warning.  The decor is nothing to get excited about, but really, who cares.  My only complaint is the lady at the counter didn't smile, or seem friendly.... but I did notice she was friendly with what seemed like "regulars" who were also dining there, so I'm sure it's nothing personal, just her personality until she gets familiar with you.  Whatever, I just needed something to complain about.  If you ever, for some odd reason, find yourself on this side of town, stop in for some noodles or curry, you will not be disappointed!

Judging by the 5-star reviews this place has I can come to only 1 conclusion.... the people reviewing this place have NO concept of good sushi.  I've been here a few times, most recently for the $18.95 All-You-Can-Eat sushi deal.  The AYCE deal is a rip off.  They only let you order 3 items at a time, have a very limited menu to choose from, take 20-25mins between orders, and they physically make the sushi different.... meaning when they fill an AYCE order they give you a huge lump of rice topped with a razor thin slice of fish.  When you order from the non AYCE menu they serve a proper nigiri.  Bullshit.  Non-AYCE speaking their food is nothing to get excited about.... their rolls are sloppy and are boring.  The fish is not that good and frankly didn't taste of superior quality.  The atmosphere is loud, bright, and full of televisions.  If you have never left Gilbert and think Safeway has "bomb sushi", well you will be in heaven here.... otherwise you would be well advised to seek sushi somewhere else.

Great place, awesome food, too packed.  I'm sorry but I am not going to wait 45mins for breakfast anywhere.  If you go on a weekday, you can usually get right in, but do yourself a favor and avoid this place on a weekend or holiday.  Their food is awesome... very fresh and very tasty, the service is great and always friendly, and the prices are very reasonable.  The decor inside is like an old farm house and very quaint.  Check it out, it's yummy!

I enjoyed this place. It's decent Sushi in AZ and it even appears to be owned and staffed by... wait for it... ACTUAL JAPANESE people. As opposed to 95% of sushi places owned/run by Koreans who memorized "Hello', "Thanks", and "Cheers' in Japanese and attempt to trick their customers by pretending to be Japanese.  Too bad this place is so far south it's practically Casa Grande adjacent.

My friend was in town and messing with one of the girls that worked here so he drug me, kicking and screaming with him.  We were super surprised at the quality of talent.  Who would have ever thought something so good would be tucked away way down in Chandler off of the 202?  I never would have.  Drinks were decent pours, moderately priced.... but screw the drinks, the WHOOTY was out in full effect.  Now mind you, this was a Saturday night, your experience may vary.

My experience here was awesome from start to finish.  I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to "please, sit down, be at home".  Awesome.  I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don't), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don't serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.  Huge bonus.  I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.    I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.  Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.  A+!

This place is GREAT!  So when I first started going here I scored and found a dish that was absolutely amazing... Hunan Spicy Two.  I literally ordered this dish every single time I went under the thought that the dish was so delicious there was no way anything could match it.  By suggestion of the owner, I began to branch out and I gotta say, every dish is better than the last... like they just keep getting better.  Their sauces are spot on and amazing.  Absolute perfection every time.  I'm a big fan of sauces in Chinese cooking and their dishes are made saucy and not dry.... so good.    It's a restaurant with no windows and the inside isn't totally chic, but it's no-nonsense mostly Cantonese style Chinese food with a hint of Thai.  Give it a shot.    *Note:  Credit cards are accepted for $10 or more.

Solid Mexican food.  This is actually one of the better Mexican places, but it does depend on what you order.  I have found their chicken to be very dry and lacking in flavor... however, everything else is tasty.  Their salsa is great and they serve free bean dip with every table.  The service is friendly and quick and their beans are very good.  This place is in my lunch rotation and is definitely better than most Mexican spots.

This is what Sprouts wishes it was. They have better products, IMO. Their prices are on par with Sprouts. A big difference is Sunflower employs fit, good looking people. This may sound weird, but I'm the type of guy who won't visit a fat doctor. Doesn't sit well with me. Sprouts and Sunflower bill themselves as a "health food store". I expect to see slender, pretty people staffed at a health food store, not the old fat people they have at Sprouts.

Gameworks has gotten a LOT better lately.  They reorganized their game floor, got rid of a bunch of crap and added a bunch of Japanese arcade machines straight from Tokyo, with English instructions typed out on paper and taped to the machines!  They have an entire little area dedicated to fighting games with the nice sit-down, 1 person-per-machine, but still 2-player linked setups.  Fighting fans will know what I'm talking about.  They also hold tournaments semi-regularly, the last time I was there they were running a KOF tournament which was $5 to enter.  I don't know about prices because I never look or care.  I go and drop $27 to fill up my card with a grip of credits and can go back for days.  I enjoy this place much more than D&B, especially since it seems D&B's games are stagnant.  Gameworks is always mixin' it up.

I feel like I must have gone to the wrong place.  First, the map and location here on Yelp is wrong, it's not on Southern/48th it's on Baseline/48th, they moved.  I had the carne adobada plate, after reading the rave adobada reviews here and frankly, I don't get it.  The meat was essentially flavorless and the rice/beans forgettable.  The only good part was the corn tortillas and they weren't even great.  I think this place's reviews are a direct result of Phonecians having very poor taste, in general, and for food.  Not to mention it was gross inside and the outside was ghetto as fuck.  I double-locked my ride and dropped the switches so fools couldn't run off with my 13".

FIRST!  Hot damn this place is GREAT!!  This place defines the term "hole in the wall Mexican".  It's across the street from a thrift store, and literally sits on the street in front of a trailer park.  Their breakfast is amazing and out of this world!  For $4-$6 you can get a DELICIOUS Mexican breakfast.  The service is friendly, food is the bomb, and price is cheap.  You will not be disappointed with this place, unless yore a total retard douche.

* This place serves amazing NORTH EASTERN THAI food from Essan region. This is an important fact to take note of.  After reading the poor reviews for this place it's easy to see that the poor reviewers have never been to Thailand and had REAL Thai food. This is real Thai food.  The service is always super friendly. The old man is very sweet and very chatty. It's just him and his wife so sometimes he's busy. They ABSOLUTELY adjust the spice levels, so whoever said they don't is misinformed.  Why do they have Chinese food on the menu? Well, look at the poor reviewers here and that's exactly why. They're serving authentic NE Thai food here. Most people in AZ can't tell you where the USA is on a map let alone Thailand. They have to offer mainstream Chinese foods because that's what their clientele expects. Same reason the Burmese spot on Southern and McClintock does as well. Unfortunately, if they sold only their core product, they probably couldn't stay alive. This is Country Club and McKellips in Mesa, AZ, not the San Gabriel Valley in SoCal.  EVERYTHING from their Authentic Thai portion of the menu is amazing and will fill your taste buds with a real treat. Explore the menu and don't be afraid to order "weird shit".

Good, standard Mexican food.  Mexican food to me is mostly all the same.  A good Mexican place tastes basically the same as the next good Mexican place, so don't expect anything mind blowing here.  Expect good food and good service for a good price.  They do serve RC Cola which I love... much better than Coke or Pepsi.  Don't come here for "healthy eating", pretty much everything is made with lard....and as expected, tastes good.  They have a full bar and there are always a decent amount of people eating, but not too packed.  This place is family owned/run and has been here for over 22 years.

I'm here 1x's a week and absolutely love Carl's haircuts. He's lightning quick, ultra precise, and super reasonable. $8 for a haircut. I was paying double the price for 6 years with far inferior quality. Even up the block they're charging $12 for a cut. Go and support Carl.

Who even knew such a good, authentic place existed way out here in the East Valley.  The place has been around for like 20 years.  The decor inside makes you feel like you're in Germany.  The wait staff was very nice and I thought the food was VERY good.  I had the sausage loaf with gravy, cabbage and these unreal home fried potatoes fried with bacon, OMG.  So good.  My date had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and potatoes.  I thought the brats were excellent as well.  They have a nice bar with a lot of German beers.  The price was not bad, 2 dinners, 1 beer was about $24.00.  Also note, their gravy is gluten-free!  Whoot.

Second time in 17 years I have ever sent sushi back at a sushi bar was here.  I should have known going to a Sushi bar so close to Apache Junction was a bad idea.  First, the prices are low and pieces are huge.  Too big actually.  The proportions are all off and like stated before, makes you seriously wonder how they can sell such large quantity for so cheap.    Well, I guess by serving less-than-fresh fish.  I ordered Albacore sashimi and took one bite, spit it out, and sent it back.... the fish was BAD.  The chef actually took a piece, ate it, and tried to tell me nothing was wrong with it and that perhaps it was the pungent sauce!  Wtf?

Garbage.  I went to this place a few years ago and really enjoyed it.  The food was excellent diner food and I was especially fond of their homemade corned beef hash.  If I would have reviewed it a year ago it would have been 4 stars.... but something has changed.  I visited again a week ago with a serious craving for corned beef hash.  Unfortunately, everything was different, and in a bad way.  It wasn't even the same recipes.  My dining partner's omelet wasn't anything to brag about either.  We will not be returning.

Pretty much what everyone else said.  Excellent food, cheap prices, no-frills atmosphere.  Easily the best tacos I have had here in AZ, perhaps CA also.  They use good ingredients, high quality meat, excellent corn tortillas.  I didn't try to go during lunch when school is in session, I could imagine it would be a nightmare being right across the street from a High School.

After going to LuLu's tacos I feel I was premature with 5 stars here.

VERY tasty food but not cheap.  I went here for lunch with coworkers and since I don't eat flour/wheat I ordered a chicken/kafta plate with rice, salad and garlic sauce.  The service was slow as there was only one waitress and what appeared to be the owner working, but the service was friendly and very accommodating.  The chicken and kafta was honestly some of the best I have ever experienced.  Chicken was moist, well marinated/seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The kafta was perfectly seasoned, char grilled, and not greasy like I have experienced elsewhere.  The meat literally fell apart with my fork, so tender and delicious.  Add the garlic sauce... forget about it.  Unreal.  Fresh minced garlic and olive oil, yum!  The rice was also tasty and some of the best I have ever had.  My bill for the chicken/kafta plate and Arizona Iced Tea was about $16.50, $19.50 out the door.... not cheap for lunch but I must say it was definitely worth every penny.  I will be returning as budget allows.

Great store, great prices, friendly service.  Everything you could ask for in a store.  I needed some repairs for my GoPed BigFoot and these guys really took care of me.  Quick, prompt service, they fixed everything and even went above and beyond.  The guy Dave really knows his GoPeds and is more than happy to explain everything to you and share his knowledge.  The repairs were priced very well and the labor charges were very fair.  I walked out of there  feeling good about my experience with Sidewalk Surfer and would recommend them to a friend.

I've been taking my baby here for years and 100% recommend Bela and his entire crew.  I've been around cars and mechanics my entire life and know that when you find a good one you can trust, you stick with it.  This is how I feel about Dynamic Imports.  They know a Lexus inside and out and I use them for all my repairs.  Expect to pay about 1/2 of what a dealer quotes you.  They have gone above and beyond the call of duty every time I have dealt with them and I always leave feeling like I received a good deal and was treated honestly and fairly.  On top of all that, Bella and his Dad are super nice guys.  They are friendly and greet me by first name always, makes you feel right at home.  I look forward to many more years of doing business with these guys and I encourage you to try them also.  I really can't say enough good things about Dynamic Imports, real class acts.

So my friend ordered the Eggs Benedict and she did not like it at all.. their Hollandaise sauce was very "lemon-y" and just not good, so we alerted our waitress and asked for 2 eggs over medium instead.  No problem, we got the two eggs as a replacement and ate our meals.   I had the corned beef hash, which tasted like it was from a can, potatoes which were good, and sausage patties which were excellent.  They easily and happily made my meal sans butter/dairy as requested.  One little bonus was that our server had an ass that was hypnotic... in the words of the great Mr. Pacino, she had a "GRRRREAT ASS!!".... but I digress  When our meal was complete we received the bill and noticed we were charged $10 for the Benedict plate.  "No prob.", I thought, she just forgot to take it off.  It was New Years day and they were swamped up in there.  So I get to the counter and alert the hostess, she goes and speaks to our waitress and returns telling us that our waitress said we ate half of the meal, which is why we were charged.  WTF?!?  I explained that she was wrong and literally two bites were taken... 1 by the person who ordered the meal and 1 by a friend to confirm how gross the dish was.  She ended up removing the item from the bill, but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak.  We're not some grungy, poor ASU students trying to scam a free dish, fuck off.

** Note:  This review is ONLY for their "Soyname" soft-serve soy ice cream.  Their ice cream is the BOMB.  It's soft-serve homemade soy icecream that tastes like real ice cream!  No gross soy taste or aftertaste, no weird consistency, just pure ice cream goodness!  I really don't know how they do it, nor do i care.  It's served "blizzard" style with a variety of add-ins to choose from.  My personal favorite is the vanilla soy ice cream with chocolate and mint syrup and chocolate chips mixed in.... heaven!  When I stopped eating dairy I was bummed and thought I would never again truly know the joys of an awesome ice cream treat, I was wrong.  I drive from Higley to this place just to get a Soyname, it's THAT good.  Even folks who don't eat dairy-free say it's amazing!

Busy, friendly service, good food, super cheap prices, awesome lemonade.  I think that about sums it up.  After 48 reviews I can't really think of anything that hasn't been said, or even anything witty or crude, so I'll leave it at that.  I had the kafta plate with rice and a lemonade for less than $10 and loved every bite.

Great ambiance, good food, good times.  As stated, the location and ambiance was outstanding.  Second only to Elements at Sanctuary, but that's hard to top for any city.  Anyway, the outdoor dining is beautiful and well decorated providing nice, romantic ambiance.  It helped that the weather was perfect also.  Lot's of trees make you forget Mill Ave. is just 1 block away.  The wine selection was impressive, even to a n00b wine drinker (luckily our friends are pros).  My friend selected a a bottle with the very helpful and knowledgeable assistance of our waitress.  I can be a real pain in the butt at restaurants because I don't eat wheat or dairy but they were more than accommodating and allowed me to select a meat and then created a dish around my requirements.  Always a nice touch.  Now to the food.  I had the rack of lamb and thought my plate was excellent.  I am by no means a Lamb connoisseur and this was probably the 3rd time I have ever eaten it (don't know why, just always ate cow and fish) and the first time at a nice place but none the less, taste buds don't lie!  It was definitely very good, but I can't say it was fantastic, I just don't have the history to compare it to.  My better half, however, was not impressed.  She had the Ahi Tuna and said it was "just ok".  This is why I gave it 4 stars not 5.  Now I never order Ahi Tuna at a nice place because I feel it always tastes the same... in other words it's usually prepared the same the the fish is so pronounced the taste from spot A is never much different than spot B and I always left feeling disappointed and wishing I had ordered something else, especially if I paid a lot of $$ for it...... so I stopped ordering that dish at nice places.  Anyway, I recommend this place, but it is expensive.  For four dinners, a bottle of wine, appetizers, and 2 glasses of wine it was about $350 for 4 people.

I've been here twice now, once was a solid 4-stars, the other, a solid 1-star.  I must add, the 4-star experience may have been clouded by their ($13) Patron Margarita.  First meal was a wonderful Carne Adobada with black beans and rice.  Meat was tender and juicy, sauce was GLUTEN-FREE and super tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, however, the $16 price tag was a little steep.  My second meal was Carnitas and they sucked.  The pork was tough and lacked any real flavor and came topped with literally a teaspoon of pico de gallo leaving the plate 90% plain pork and 100% boring.  I do like the fact they have their gluten-free options highlighted on their online menu, and can provide that same menu in-store, on-demand.  I'm 1 for 2 at this place, perhaps I'll try it again, but if I don't, I'm sure I won't lose any sleep over it.

Pretty good Chinese food.... nothing phenomenal, but good.  Good, tasty Cantonese style Chinese food.  They offer good portions for a fair price.  The price was a little higher than I am used to for dishes, but they tasted good and the portions were large.  I didn't go for dim-sum, just for lunch.

With two very good, family run BBQ spots within 7miles of this place, I'm not sure why anyone would go here.  Their BBQ sauce is not homemade, it arrives at the store in bulk, and is no better than something you would find at Safeway.... full of additives, preservatives,  "natural flavoring", and most absurd, GLUTEN.  Skip this place and go to Cooper's or Joe's in Gilbert.

I go to Vegas a lot. I hate Vegas. I hate the strip, but I'm usually stuck on the strip. Anyway, I'm cheap like a Dutch person and hate paying casino prices for anything. I also happen to LOVE L.A. K-Town-style KBBQ. This place brings me back to when I was hustlin' on the streets of Korea Town. Anyway, if you like KBBQ, and are stuck in the shit hole that is the vegas strip, this place is a welcome relief. Get off the strip and eat some real food.

Very good BBQ here.  I wouldn't say it's "the best", but it's right up there.  It's family owned, which is a big plus for me.  They also have homemade root beer!  It's a little on the pricey side.... expect around $10/person.  Another plus is their BBQ sauce does not contain gluten.

Excellent food at a great price.  I had the pleasure of going during their Sunday buffet.  What a treat.  $8.99 for all you can eat Gyros, rice, chicken, meatballs, hummus, fruit, lentil soup, stuffed grape leaves, pita, etc., etc..... the food was all very fresh and wonderfully seasoned.    The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  Their food is all home made and you can tell by the excellent taste.  Their lemon aid is fantastic, I highly recommend it.

I am a BIG fan of this place.  The establishment is very clean, the employees are very friendly and very helpful.  They don't have the attitude I have received at a lot of other places.  Their jewelry is superior to any other place here in the Valley I have bought from.... I now buy from them exclusively.  They also, surprisingly, are more concerned about you, the customer, than about making the sale and have actually talked me out of certain things if I seemed to be not 110% sure about something.  Their customer service is also excellent, which is HUGE for me.  I simply wouldn't go anywhere else.

FAIL.  After reading all the positive reviews of this place, my girl and I went to give it a shot.  We were very disappointed.  So I ordered the beef shawarma and my girl had the falafel.  We got our meal in a timely manner, however they forgot our salads completely.  No one came over after our plates were dropped off, not once, to check up on us until we were both essentially done with our meals.  This was especially bad for two reasons:  1. because i had an ingredient question that was essential to me being able to eat the garlic sauce  and 2.  because the meat was very dry, flavorless, and mostly gristle.  The only way I could even enjoy the meat was to dip it in the garlic sauce to add some flavor, but I couldn't eat the garlic sauce because I thought it was made with dairy.  Totally sucked.  The fries were good.  When our waitress finally did come over, after we had both finished, I expressed my feelings and voiced my complaints and my meal was totally comped.  So that was cool.  I will go back here and try it again because of all the good reviews and because they comped my meal.

When I first moved to AZ 3years ago, I too did a frantic search for real pizza.  It took about 4 different pizza joints until I found Nicantoni's and I have never eaten anything since.  Honestly, eating pizza anywhere else is a complete waste of time..... this pizza is absolutely the best, hands down.  Ok, so it taste's great... how about everything else?  Well, it's prefect.  Great decor, friendly staff, and rock bottom prices.  My girl and I would get a large pepperoni pizza, side salad for 2, two drinks and walk out for under $25 with tip and have pizza leftover for 2 days.  The first time I was there the owner came over and chatted it up with us, asking how we found the place, where we were from, etc... very nice guy and made us feel very welcome.  Also, every 10th pizza is free!  They give you these poker chips for every pizza you buy, bring in 10 chips and get a free pizza.  Needless to say whenever friends were in town we'd go there and rack up the pizza chips.  :)  You MUST get a pepperoni pizza and an Italian soda.  I'm really not sure how their pepperoni tastes so good, but it's the best I have ever tasted.

Now THIS is BBQ!!  I have tried about 5 BBQ spots in AZ and this one is BY FAR the best.  The meats are so perfectly smoked you almost don't need BBQ sauce.... however, since their BBQ sauce is soooo good, you would be crazy not to!  Paradoxical, huh?  Their ribs are to die for and easily the best ribs I have ever tasted, anywhere.  Their brisket is unreal and pulled pork is heavenly.  Their prices are also very good and you can just buy meat by the pound.  I usually get like 1/2 lb. brisket, 1/2 lb. pulled pork, side of beans and a drink for under $15.  And they do not skimp on the portions... a .5lb is easily a .70lb and will get you enough for two plates of leftovers.  It's insane.  Seriously, if you love BBQ and are thinking of going to that other place up Gilbert Rd., drive an extra 3 miles or so south and go here, you won't be disappointed!  NOTE:  Their BBQ sauce is gluten-free and so are their BBQ beans.

Never trust a BBQ place that serves it's meats drowning in BBQ sauce and grease.  Mediocre at best, bordering on "not good".  Sides were "meh", BBQ sucked, prices were high.  I can't believe so many people come here.

Best Sushi East of Los Angeles: Being a Los Angeles native, and an avid sushi eater for over 17years, I figured that by moving by to the desert I would have to settle for mediocre sushi. I was wrong. Sushi Ave. is on par, if not better in some ways (price, friendliness), with the best sushi bars in Los Angeles. Sushi Chef James serves up a wonderful array of house specials and traditional sushi dishes that will have you hooked. Highly Recommended!

Great place, fair prices.  Cleaners are, for the most part, all the same.... if they get your clothes clean and don't ruin them, they're good... if not, they're bad.  This place shines in friendly, courteous service.  The lady who runs the place is funny and friendly and not afraid to chat it up.  Beware, she can be sarcastic, but I love that.  Never had a problem here and prices are fair.

* walk in, no customers in the store, greeted by older Asian woman *  Me: "Hi, can you make your milk teas with soy milk?" Her: "We use a non-dairy product." Me: "Oh, cool... does it contain casein?" Her: *puzzled look* Me: "May I see the ingredients?" Her: "No, I don't have ingredients." Me: "Ummm, yes you do, I've seen them,just hand me the bag so i can read the ingredients." Her: *dirty pissed look* walks over, grabs the bag of chemical processed bullshit they call non-dairy creamer and hands it to me. Me: "Ok, looks good, I'll take a Chocolate Snow with Boba please." Her: *very condescending* "Do you always ask for ingredients everywhere you go?" Me: "Yes, and you would too if you had food allergies." *pause* "Do you always lie to your customers faces when they ask you questions?"  Drink was tasty, service was bitchy. Avoid.

Another GREAT Boba spot that has Soy Milk!  The decor is really sweet... graffiti style walls and contemporary seating.  Their drinks are large and very good.  I had their Red Bean Milk Tea w/ Soy Milk and Boba.... mmmmmmm.  They used real red beans (another boba spot in the e.valley uses like ground red beans.. not as good).  They offer a lot of other goodies, but I'm a boba fiend and can never fathom getting anything else.  $3.50 for a 20oz milk tea, no extra charge for the soy... nice.

So let's say it's 3:30am on a Tuesday morning and you think to yourself, "damn I really wish I could play [fill in blank with any nerdy game]", well consider your wish granted.  Gamer's Inn is open 24hours and ALWAYS has people engaging in some sort of friendly game playing.  They have huge table tops with model buildings and terrain for the Warhammer type games, they have rows and rows of tables set up for 1on1 MTG type card games, and huge square tables for multiplayer RPG games such as DnD.  Oh, did I mention they also have like 50 PC's set up for just $1hr?  And, of course, enough snack and drinks to live for a year.  You know you're a nerd, just go... there are others out there like you, I promise.

Simply the best Thai place in the East Valley.  This little place is not easy to spot, located in the North - East corner of Power / Southern next door to a Thai Massage place.  They have just 5 tables inside, a counter for 4, and outside seating.  Their prices are very good, service is great, and food is to die for.  I recommend their Spicy Noodles with shrimp and the Red Curry with shrimp.  They do spicy from 1-5, perhaps even hotter if you ask.  I like spicy food and get everything 4 and it's just right.  Their food, especially the veggies, are extremely fresh.  They definitely use superior quality produce.  Another HUGE plus is they offer Soy milk for their Thai Tea and also offer Wheat-Free Tamari soy sauce for all of their dishes.  For people who don't/can't eat wheat this is a big plus.  Neither are on the menu, just ask.

So the last 6 times I have been here it's been back to AWESOME.  Cheap eats, friendly service, wheat-free soy-sauce, soy-milk, and most of all, AMAZING noodle dishes.  Perhaps someone read my reviews?  Thanks for stepping it up, Thai House, and fixing the obvious consistency issues.

I didn't know Chinese food THIS GOOD existed, especially in MESA!  Being a huge fan of Chinese food, I was very excited to try this place after the rave reviews I read on Yelp.  I was not disappointed!  This place serves up the best Chinese food in Arizona, easily..... and for CHEAP.  You would be hard pressed to find a dish over $7.  Do yourself a favor when you get the menu and just skip the first three pages until you start seeing "Hong Kong Style xxxxxxxx" and start there.  They have truly authentic Cantonese / Hong Kong style cuisine with dishes I have never seen anywhere else.    I have had probably 8 different items there so far and each one was AMAZING.   Try something out of the ordinary, you won't be disappointed.  Also, you have to try a Chow Fun dish.  It's a MUST.  I have never tasted Chow Fun as good as they have it.... it's crazy how good their Chow Fun is, no joke.  Two words of caution..... sometimes the English translation of the items is not exactly the same as the Chinese translation... obviously the chef uses the Chinese translation, so do yourself a favor and confirm the choice with the waitress.  For instance, their "Black Pepper Sauce Chow Fun" is actually Chow Fun with Black Bean sauce with green peppers.  Not a big deal since everything is excellent, but just so you know.  Second word of caution.... you WILL get addicted to this food!  You have been warned.  :)

This place really is fantastic.  In a world of faceless, big box hardware warehouses filled to the ceiling with wares and employed by complete morons or lifeless zombies, Paul's Ace is heaven-sent.  I have never had a bad experience here, in fact, quite the opposite.  Every trip has been a buying pleasure.   As you enter the store you are greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff member who will point you in whatever direction you need to go.  It seems like every aisle you turn down there is a smiling, happy face to greet you and to assist you with whatever you need.  Not to mention these guys/gals really know their stuff.  They seem to LOVE hardware.  They are more than happy to, without even asking, carry your items to the counter for you and even offer to carry them out to your car.  Real class acts.  The best part of this place is that they are not corporate neutered pussies and will actually offer services the "other guys" won't because of rules imposed by some bullshit corporate mandate out of fear of a law-suit.  Fuck faceless corporations and fuck attorneys.  Pau's Ace isn't as big as the other guys, and you may pay a few pennies more, but it is worth EVERY penny.  Plus, if you're like me and equate time with money, you actually come out ahead of the game by shopping here because you don't waste your precious time wading through 100,000 sq/ft of bullshit staffed with complete dockles.  No self-checkout here with a toothless, ogrish overseer, great service from start to finish.  OH, they've got a great popcorn machine too!

I left this place feeling extremely unimpressed.  I had the "Spicy Mexican Skillet".  It wasn't spicy, or even good.  It was very bland, very boring, and very lacking all around.  Food sucked and our waitress took forever to take our order and when she did she reeked of smoke.  So instead of serving us, she was out back having a cig.  At least wash your hands and pop a mint when you're done so my nose isn't filled with stale smoke.  Prices were high, food sucked.  I also felt the interior seating was very lackluster.  Had a cafeteria feel to it, not cozy at all.

WIN.  I've been here a few times and every time I say to my dining partner, "damn this is good".  Their food is excellent and homemade.  The waiters are very friendly (family run spot) and knowledgeable about their food and ingredients.  I highly recommend the chicken kabob, lamb kabob, and garlic sauce... YUM!  For gluten-free diners, steer clear of their lentil soup and their rice, both items contain small wheat noodles.  Shame too because the soup is fantastic.  Also while you're there don't sleep and order a lemonade, it's crazy good.

This place is not even close to the best place for a cheesesteak.  This doesn't really surprise me considering there are only two places I have been to in the West that makes a GOOD cheesesteak, one is in Scottsdale and the other in Orange County, CA.  Right off the bat their prices are WAY too high for what you get.  They have an option on the menu for "Extra Steak $2.50".  WTF??  I'm paying $10 for a sandwich and there's a chance I might want more steak on my sandwich?  Hell no.  For $10 I had better not be able to finish that thing, just the way it comes.  Well, turns out I should have paid the $2.50 b/c the regular portion was very weak.  Of course then I would have had a $12.50 mediocre cheesesteak instead of a $10 mediocre cheesesteak.  This place left a lot to be desired and I'll never waste my time there again.  Just as I had expected... overpriced and mediocre.

I am always happy when I walk out of an Ace Hardware and this trip was no exception.  I parked 50 feet from the front door, walked into the store and was immediately greeted by a friendly greeter asking me what I looking for. "Plastic glue", I replied.  "Aisle 10, half way down on the right." So I start walking toward aisle 10, I hear the greeter over his walkie-talkie-ear-piece-thinggy say, "got a customer coming down 10 looking for plastic glue." As I walked over to, aisle 10 I could see an Ace associate at the other end walking toward me and eventually meeting me right in front of the plastic glue section. "Hi there, can I help you find some glue?", he asked. "I'm looking for the strongest glue you have to bind the types of plastic used in [xx.classified.xx]?" He immediately recommended the brand Plastic Surgery and explained why it was a good product for my specific application. I read the package quickly, smiled, said, "thanks a lot!", headed toward the register, paid, walked 50ft to my car and was on with my day.  I paid a fair price and received the highest level of customer service.  Ace never disappoints. Total time from getting out of car to getting back in, under 5 minutes.  It takes half that time to get from your parking space to the front door of a Home Depot or Lowe's.  Five stars, no question.

Gluten Free Pizza.... delivered.  [End Review]  Seriously though, how amazing is this for the gluten-free diners!  Fortunately, for peeps like myself, more and more people are waking up to the fact that A LOT of people are gluten-intolerant, which means more availability of good products, like Barro's Gluten-Free Pizza!  They use the pizza crust from Gluten Free Creations in Phoenix, just like PieZano's and Piccazzo's does.  They only come in one size, small.  I ordered a 2-topping pie which set me back $13.50 after the $2.50 delivery fee (does this mean I don't have to tip?), plus a $3 tip..... total cost, $16.50.  Steep?  Perhaps, but how do you put a price on happieness?  Too bad we're not in Italy where at birth, every child is tested for Celiac disease and if they have it, are given a monthly stipend from the government to help pay for the elevated cost of gluten-free foods.

Solid 4 stars.  I usually judge Thai places on their noodle dishes and this place is GREAT.  Their spicy noodles were better than most and very spicy when I ordered it "2 spicy" out of 3.  Ingredients were fresh, service was good, decor was simple but nice, and the price was fair.  Note:  You will like this place even more if you like Thai Milfs.  The only thing that would make this place better would be if they carried soy milk to make Thai Tea.

After living here for 6years, Hana is the best sushi I've had in Phoenix, period. In fact, it's so good, I will not eat sushi anywhere else now.   Now, let me give you some context so you may determine if this review is for you:  Do you dip your rice in soy sauce? Do you add "wasabi" to your soy sauce? Do you eat rolls other than basic seaweed, rice, fish? Do you think the green paste is wasabi? Do you call the fish part of the nigiri, "sushi"?  If you said YES to any of the above (don't lie), this review is NOT for you. Otherwise, read on....  Hamachi Kama was brilliant; perfectly cooked and delicious. Yellowtail handroll was utterly amazing. The yellowtail handroll is my go-to. At Hana the fish was melt-in-your-mouth fresh and had the perfect fish to rice ratio which is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I also tried the halibut, striped bass, crab, masago with quail egg, and salmon. All the fish was the freshest, best tasting I have eaten since moving from Los Angeles. The sunomono was even amazing!  Help-wise, the service was spot-on. Extremely friendly and very attentive.  I can't say enough good things about this place. Disclaimer: I have yet to try Yasu, which I hear is amazing as well, but compared to every other sushi joint in Phoenix, THIS is the spot to go to. F everywhere else.

Yup, this place is very good.   Friendly service... check! Fair prices... check! AMAZING food... check! Best Lemonade I've ever had... check!  They are also very knowledgeable about their food ingredients, so if you have food allergies or prefer not to indulge in certain ingredients, you will have no problem dining here.  I personally recommend the Lamb, it was fantastic.

YAY, BOBA!  I lived in the Korea Town area of Los Angeles for 2.5 years and loved it.  While there I developed a serious Boba addiction, thanks in part to the fact there was a great Boba spot on every corner.... literally.  Phoenix area.... not so much.  In fact, after moving here and seeing how things were as far as diversity, I figured my Boba days were over.  Enter Eba.  My life is changed.  Not only are their teas great, the price is right... $2.97 for a 24oz, plus staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I recommend the Thai tea w/ Boba or the Red Bean with Boba.  Ok, here's the best part which separates this place from every other Boba spot in the East side.... SOY MILK.  Yes, they have soy milk and don't charge extra for it!  Awesome.

Simply put, their Gelato is amazing!  I am a big fan of Gelato for two reasons:  it tastes good, and they have a lot of dairy-free options, not just "rainbow sherbet".  Their dairy-free flavors are so creamy and smooth you would swear they have dairy in them.  Of course an epic win for me is they are located in the East Valley at Brown / Higley Rd.    The place is family owned / run by very nice people and they tend to stay open late.  The couple actually studied Gelato making in Italy and their flavors and textures show it.  I have had a lot of Gelato and IMO this place has the best!

I went to see the Killers of Comedy show (greatest comedy line up ever, btw.) here and I must say... this place sucks.    The drinks were way over priced.... $7 for weak drinks with poor liquor selection.  We ordered shots of tequila chilled and they poured the shots into shot glasses.... see they have to ice the liquor to chill it and it's always supposed to be served in a glass with larger pour to compensate for the water added via icing.  Total amateurs.  The seats were literally the worst seats I have ever sat on in my life.. honestly.  A wooden bench would have been more comfortable.  Luckily, mixed in with the hellish seats were a _few_ decent seats and I was there early enough to be able to rearrange my row and grab a decent seat.  There are four bathrooms with four total toilets... four!  For the entire place... and two of the toilets didn't even have a handle to flush, but they were kind enough to remove the top so customers could reach into the water and flush manually...!!?!  Seriously.  Oh, and we found a bag of coke someone must have dropped in the bathroom.  Sucks for them.  Classic.  Lighting sucked and had the crowd uncomfortably lit up.  The staff was nice and the sound was good, and I got to meet Beetlejuice and Yucko the Clown so that gives it one star.    I can see if you are like 14 and want to see some local Screamo band and your friend's older brother drops you off for the night how it could seem cool, but anyone else should avoid this place.... unless you're jonesin' for some booger sugar and feeling lucky.

Not great compared to a good deli, not good when you factor in the price.  It was soon after moving here from Los Angeles that I found Chompies.... being a regular patron of West Coast heavyweights such as Langers, and even Canters, I was hungry for good deli food and thrilled... at first.    Their food is "meh" at BEST and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the quality.  If they charged 1/2 the price they do currently, this place would be 4-stars.. but don't come up in here trying to charge Langer's prices and serve up Schlotzsky's quality.   Next.

Woah, UBER FAIL.  FULL DISCLOSURE:  I was contacted by Salty management in response to my less than favorable review of their Old Town location.  I was offered a gift card as an "I'm sorry, try us again" ploy in exchange for more detailed information on my shitty experience.  Ok, sure, I like free stuff, send it.  Plus, it sounded like they were making changes and attempting to improve things there, so I didn't mind giving it another shot.  FOUR months later, I receive the $50 gift card.  Right away I was disappointed that the gift card was supposedly only good at the North Scottsdale location, 32miles each way from my house.  Whatever, 3 gallons of gas round-trip (approx $6.00), why not.  First things first (and I like to start on a good note before the bloodshed) their wait-staff is fairly attractive, nice sort of emo-slut look... easy on the eyes.  Our waitress was pretty cute, friendly, bra exposed... nice.  Their $8.50 "Monthly Special Margarita" was actually very tasty and poured very well.  Not too sweet and very strong.  If this was the only place in town to get a good margarita, that would be one thing.... but it's not.  Now let it rain blood.  The lighting in this place was the first fail of the night... we had to move from our first booth because we both felt we were sitting under a spotlight.  Our second booth (a round one) was a little better since we weren't under a spotlight, but the lighting cast a shadow on our table (shadow caused by my body) so that I had to move my body to the right and hold the menu to the left of me to read anything.  So annoying.  FAIL.  We ordered their $1.95 Unlimited Chips and Salsa.  The chips were soaked in oil and the bottom 3/4 of the basket was un-edible because they were crumbs!  Wait, did a "Mexican" place just charge me $1.95 for shitty chips and "ok" salsa?  Yup, they did.  FAIL.  I ordered the Fajitas, half steak half chicken with corn tortillas.  The Fajitas were made in this tomato sauce, which at first I wasn't too thrilled about, but in all honesty, I'm super glad they did because if it wasn't for the tomato sauce, the dish would have had 0 taste.  The meats had no seasoning on them and tasted completely bland.  I actually considered using salt (I NEVER use salt, even at home, unless it's popcorn) to give it some amount of taste.  Thank god for the tomato sauce.  The corn tortillas can only be described as disgusting.  I was only given three tiny corn tortillas but only ate two of them.  I can't really describe what's wrong with them, but they are foul.  The Fajitas came with a plate of cheese, rice, sour cream, and shredded romaine lettuce (yeah).  The only thing on the accompanied plate I ate was the rice and it was COLD!  Not warm, not luke warm, COLD!  My dining partner's rice was cold also.  WTF?  Needless to say, the cold rice was the best part of the meal, seriously.  F A I L.  My dining partner ordered this Chipotle Chicken Burrito which, believe it or not, lacked taste and was bland.  Yes, BLAND!!!  How is it possible that a burrito covered in cheese, injected with a Chipotle sauce is bland?  No clue, but these clowns pulled it off.  Unbelievable.  F A I L.  Our bill came, $45.32.. I figured, "great, $50 on the gift card, $5 out of pocket, she gets a $10 tip, and I never have to think about this place again".  Wrong.  They wouldn't let us put the tip on the gift card, so I ended up with $5 left on the card and had to pay $10 out of pocket.  So $10 out of pocket + $6 to get there, I paid $16 bucks and 2 hours of my life to eat an incredibly SHITTY meal.  In retrospect I wish they never sent me the gift card and I had stayed home and ate left overs instead, spending the $16 on a bottle of Vodka and a can of Soda Water.  I don't even really understand, their food got WORSE!!!  Why would you send gift cards, encourage people to try your place again and actually make your food worse?  Am I in bizzaro world here?  Aren't you supposed to IMPROVE the food?  "Mexican" food is the easiest food in the world to make "decent", hell even [fill in blank]-abertos is better, Macayo's, Serrano's, El Torrito, you name it, it's better (even the Clarendon's now defunct Mexican spot was better).  I have to figure the ONLY reason people come here is for the patio and to drink.  But still... there are plenty of places to drink, why support such a lousy place?  Perhaps they rely on their patrons to either be drunk when they eat so they don't notice, or so drunk afterward they forget.    U B E R   F A I L ! !

Top 3 WORST Dining Experience EVER!  Saturday night my girl and I decided to check this place out, excited for the change in menu and an "Old School Mexican Food" experience.  We were thoroughly disappointed in almost every possible way.  We arrived at about 9:15pm and didn't get out of there until 11:15pm... TWO hours for $9/plate Mexican food.  Did I mention we were 1 of 3 TOTAL parties in there?  No big parties, two tables of 4 and our party of 2.  Service was so poor and slow it was comical.  The waitress would disappear for LONG periods of time.  Maybe smoking weed or something, I have no idea....?  Weed would explain why it took 20minutes after ordering a scoop of sorbet before it found it's way to our table.  Now the food.  Junk at best.  First, after literally 45mins-1hr after being seated, our food finally arrived.... COLD... not luke-warm, cold.  I had grilled chicken w/ rice and beans, my girl had chicken soft tacos.  We sent our plates back and the waitress said she would have the kitchen remake the meal immediately.  Well, 25minutes later the new plates arrived.  Really?  25 minutes to remake a plate of grilled chicken and soft tacos then slap a spoon of rice and beans on the plate?  Now the second time the food STILL was not hot... this time it was luke-warm.  Whatever, we were starving, so we ate it.    The food itself lacked any seasoning and frankly any taste.  I can make better Mexican food at home, shit, Filiberto's makes better Mexican food.  Interesting also, the second plates had portions about 1/2 of what was delivered initially.  I usually have left overs and don't really like huge portions, so this was fine with me, but it just goes to show the lack of consistency.  The waitress was always very nice and courteous, and she did offer us a free item to make up for the cold food, so she appeared to be trying, I just don't understand what the issue was.  We were not alone in a bad experience.... one table of 4, sitting behind us, ordered a nacho appetizer with guac on the side... well she brought one out with guac all over it, explaining there was a mistake and another one was being made, but they could have this one also, instead of throwing it away.  Well their 2nd one, prepared correctly, didn't come out until AFTER they were all 4 done with their meals!  The other party of 4 who were seated before we even arrived, didn't get their food for 15 minutes after our first cold plate... meaning they waited at least 1 hour for their food and they ordered before us!  They had burritos... burritos!  How long can it possibly take to make a burrito?  Dinner's over, and I decide to try a refreshing sorbet I had eyed on the menu earlier.  I don't eat dairy or wheat, so when I see a dessert item that has neither ingredient, I get excited.  There are not too many deserts around that are made without wheat or dairy.  They had a few very good sounding selections, I opted for Passion Fruit.  So 20 minutes later, when my single scoop of sorbet arrived, I dove right in...... and almost spit it out!  It was the w-o-r-s-t tasting sorbet I have ever encountered... in fact, I don't think it was prepared properly, or even sorbet.  It was the most sour, most tart thing I have ever tasted.... to the point where it was literally impossible to NOT make a face after taking a bite (like the super-sour-face).  My girl thought I was joking and being dramatic so she took a bite.... haha, you should have seen her face.  Classic.  Un-edible.  It literally had the consistency, and tasted like that frozen fruit juice concentrate you buy in the store, without ANY sugar.  It was horrible.  Horrible.  Sad really... I truly wanted to like this place.  The atmosphere and decorations are very cool, chic, and modern.  It really _looks_ tight, but produced one of my 3 worst experiences ever.  Funny thing is, I had a gift certificate, so I got most of the meal and 4 martini's free..... and I still hated every second of it and would have absolutely rather gone anywhere else and paid.

Woah!  I was in the mood for Boba (which tends to happen whenever I'm awake) and spotted Tea Infusion.  "I wonder if they have Boba?", I asked my partner in crime.  "Doubt it", she said, which instantly became a challenge....   As I walked in I noticed the place was very well decorated... nice, modern,. well lit... classy space, oh and smelled great!    Yes, they had Boba, but it was night time and I wanted something decaf.  The very friendly and helpful staff recommended I try the decaf, iced, soy, chai tea with boba.  haha.  Holy crap was it good!!  They brew the tea right there, to order, then ice it down, add soy, boba, boom, a dreamy combination of chai, soy, and boba.  It was phenomenal.  I wish it wasn't smack in the middle of the Tempe Marketplace, i.e. easier to get to, but rest assure every time I go to Dave and Buster's I will be hitting this place up for a "decaf, soy, iced chai tea with boba".

EXCELLENT service for a good price.  We recently found Goober when we switched our dog's food to Evo, which is a high-end, "6 star", all natural dog food.  Well the problem was there were only about 4 places here in the valley that sold it.  I knew Goober had free next-day delivery and assumed the "Free" was built into the price of the food and I would pay more per bag for this "free" service.    Well, after calling every store that sold it, I found that a couple of them had it for a few bucks less per bag, BUT, when I calculated the cost of gasoline to get there and back (not even speaking about cost of time), they were actually the exact same price as Goober.  Some places were selling it for the same price as Goober right off the bat, with gasoline they were higher.  So for the same price, and next day delivery, I decided to give Goober a shot.  I called them up and was helped by one of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  She was extremely knowledgeable about their products, and very friendly.  She set up my account and said my food would be there the next day.  Well the next day my food arrived with a complimentary baggie of dog treats... nice touch.  Re-ordering my food literally takes 1 minute... I call.. give my name, say "same order", and "same credit card", then "bye".  Next day my dog food is at my front door.  It couldn't be easier.  You can order on their website (which is a good eCommerce site, not janky), or over the phone, whatever you want.  They're local, family owned, and I highly recommend them.  I understand you can drive over to Mesa to their store and shop/buy, but I've never been there so I can't speak to that... but with good prices, free delivery, and a good website, I doubt I'll ever go there.  :)

** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR CONFERENCE SETUP, NOT THE ROOMS **  As far as places to attend a conference goes, this place is just fine.  Setup is nice, centrally located so it makes it easy to skip out somewhere good for lunch (DON'T EAT AT THEIR RESTAURANT).  The sound and lighting was up to par, temperature was fine.  My only complaint was their gift shop didn't allow you to purchase drinks with anything except cash and they didn't offer free water except for the drinking fountains.  Lucky for me, some kind (and beautiful) woman bought me my bottle of Perrier after experiencing my same dilemma just one day prior.

I loved this place and the double-soy-cappuccino was one of the best I have ever tasted.  The Cap was made perfectly... awesome thick foam, tasty coffee, great cup (haha, srsly, the cup is great).  The inside is filled with art and has a cool vibe.  $2.50 for a double-soy-cap, not bad.  I just wish this place was closer to me, I'd be a regular.

SIX (6) DIFFERENT TYPES OF GLUTEN-FREE BEER.  Including 3 types of imported gluten-free Belgian brews.  ftw.  [/end review]  Addendum:  I guess if I wasn't gluten-free I would go 3 stars. Their beer selection was pretty decent.  They had a lot of Belgian Ales and imports, but Sun Devil Liquor has a larger selection.

$1 Sushi, wtf??!?!?  Ok, so I tried this place after I overheard two people talking about it in a restaurant one night.  They said it was a GREAT spot, and they were right!  I couldn't believe the price, $1 for a nigiri piece, $3 for a standard tuna roll or spicy tuna (8 piece).  It's mostly a take-out spot and does not offer much in the way of decor, but when I can get an entire sushi meal for $10.81 (haha, I go way too much), who cares?  Their fish is always fresh and the size of the pieces are just fine, especially for $1.  You can't complain.  I'm here 2x's a week on average and completely hooked.  I usually call on my way home, place my order, pick up, and go home to enjoy.  They now even have Tamari wheat-free soy sauce!  (on request)  They have a variety of specialty rolls as well that vary in price from $3 - $7.  They also serve a sort of Vietnamese-Chinese fusion menu with spring rolls, Pho, stir-fry, etc...  I haven't tried anything there except for the sushi, but people seem to enjoy it.  I highly recommend this place.  Again, go for the food, not the atmosphere.  The sushi chef, John, is very cool too.  Nice guy and very personable.  Makes you feel at home.

I should have walked out right after I walked in.  My gut was telling me to leave, but I didn't.... I stuck it out.  Big mistake.  We were the only ones in there at 1pm on a Saturday.. bad sign #1.  I ordered the 1lb of boiled shrimp, "Original" style with rice.  I didn't realize "Original" meant "no flavor and way overcooked".  They were so overcooked they were hard to peel and were served with a chipotle mayonnaise!!  Gross!  The rice was literally Asian rice, with a sprinkle of  "cajun seasoning" on top that tasted exactly like a bowl  of white Asian rice.  My partner had a Jambalaya thing, thickened with corn-starch and had overcooked shrimps as well.    I would highly recommend avoiding this place.

Bravo!  This place is "the bomb".  Everything is homemade, fresh, and delicious.  Their fries are cut and fried on site, the meats are marinated and cooked to perfection.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable.  This was one of my favorite spots when I was working in the area.  As of Jan 1, 2010, they now charge for Credit/Debit transactions, so bring cash.  I have nothing negative to say about this place and encourage everyone to give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

NICE!  Good Pho, beautiful environment, attentive staff, delicious (non-dairy, w00t w00t) deserts, great prices..... really, the whole package.  I was never a big fan of Pho until I found this place and I have been probably 10x's in the last 6 months.... always for Pho.  It's excellent.  For $6.50 you get a huge bowl of wonderful Pho soup, rice noodes, and beef with a large of plate of been sprouts, basil, jalapenos, and lime to toss in to taste.  They're open 7 days a week starting at 10am every day, do yourself a favor and start your day with a bowl of Pho, especially after a night of drinking, you will not be sorry.  After your bowl of Pho you will be super full, but do not let this stop you from indulging in a red-bean slush with jelly and coconut milk... holy crap it's amazing (and dairy-free).  Go there NOW!

I was super stoked when I realized there was a BBQ joint close to my office... too bad it's just "OK".  I couldn't really tell the difference in taste or looks between the pulled pork and the brisket.  Seriously.  It was weird.  The spicy BBQ sauce is garbage and literally looks and tastes like Ketchup with hot sauce added.  Bunk.  The Lemonade was, surprisingly, very watery and bland.  The side of beans was OK, nothing special.  Next!

Wow... just wow.  This place is heaven for non-gluten eaters.  Up until about 30mins ago I was getting a little depressed over this whole cupcake craze.  Not anymore, I just ate one of the best cupcakes I have ever had and it was gluten-free and dairy-free!  They have everything here:  cupcakes, cookies, pizza dough (they supply the gf dough to all the pizza joints in town that do gf pizza), pasta, hamburger buns, rolls, twinkies, cakes, pies, thanksgiving stuffing, bread crumbs to make your own stuffing, bagels, white bread, baguettes, I mean everything!  Oh, and it all tastes amazing.  The location is a little hard to find the first time being behind a barber shop and, like all gluten-free products, is not very cheap, but if you avoid gluten and dairy, this place is a god send.  They are very knowledgeable about their products, make everything in house, and have their products listed by allergen.... so if you don't eat dairy, eggs, or nuts, or any combination, they have it all under an easy list.  They can also special make anything for you... birthday cakes, whatever.

"ugh... that was gross...." were the last words uttered before paying my $32 and change (for two people) and leaving.  I ordered the sampler platter with brisket, pulled pork, and a hot link.  The meal was served in a skillet.... the entire bottom of the skillet was COVERED in grease.  The brisket and pork was literally soaked in grease!  It was like they took the meat, dunked it in oil, then served it... it was disgusting.  The Cowboy Beans were cold and lacked flavor... plus the beans seemed undercooked.  The Spicy Fries and Sweet Tea were the best part of the meal.  The hot link wasn't for me... I didn't like the taste, but the other meats had a decent taste but not dripping in grease, I couldn't get over that.

So I was starving and in the area, so I stopped in again on a tip from a friend that their ribs were "delicious dude".  I figured I would give it one more chance, and I'm glad I did.  Their baby back ribs are actually VERY good.  I was shocked.  Their ribs trump Joe's by a long shot.  The rest of their food is "meh" but the ribs are dank.

Best Gumbo I have ever had.  Period.  I went here after reading about it here on Yelp.  Being a fan of Cajun food I was excited to try this place and am so glad I did.  This place jumped into my frequent visit rotation after the first bite.  Heaven in a bowl.   Service was very good and friendly.  They were very accommodating given the fact I don't eat gluten or dairy and the chef's had no problem identifying items which I could eat.  I attribute this to the fact the food is all homemade and definitely not from a can!  I had the Seafood Gumbo and a side of Dirty Rice instead of the potato salad.  The gumbo was packed with seafood, perfectly seasoned, and the rice.... oh man, the rice was so good (rice inside the gumbo).  I literally couldn't stop eating... like physically was unable to put my spoon down.  I've eaten a fair amount of Cajun food from stalls at a farmer's market in Los Angeles, to high end reservation only spots and this place has them all beat.  Do yourself a favor and try this place, you won't be disappointed!  One word of advice... don't bother with the baskets.  Like the fried shrimp, or blackened chicken... you can get that stuff anywhere... try one of their special dishes.  The place was relatively empty in the middle of a Friday afternoon, which is a shame because this place should be PACKED.  It is kind of hard to find, and I didn't really even see a sign outside, and they've only been open for a couple of months... spread the word.

After my great experience at this place, I decided a "big ass bowl of gumbo" was just what I needed after work.  This time around the portion was literally about 1/2 what it was my first time and the taste was nowhere near as good as it was before.  Sad because it was SO good the first time around.  Judging by the most recent reviews of this place it looks like they're experiencing consistency issues.  I'll try it again for best 2 out of 3.

Ok, so I promised I would return one last time for Gumbo after my previous bad experience.  All I can say is HOT DAMN their gumbo is good.  It's back to all it's glory.  After a little chat with the manager he revealed they were having consistency issues but those issues have all been resolved, and he was right.  I might even say their gumbo was better than my first experience and the dirty rice was perfect.  I ate a huge bowl of gumbo and a huge bowl of rice, was so stuffed and uncomfortable I contemplated missing class.... yet I still wanted to eat more.  I also found out they won "Best Gumbo 2008" in some All Cajun Cookoff or something, basically all Cajun joints in Arizona.  Give this place a shot, or another shot if you were there and disappointed.... they were obviously experiencing growing pains and issues with their recipes that have been corrected now.

Two words, super awesome.  Slightly more west of the 51 than I am normally comfortable traveling, but I was feeling adventurous, so glad.  So it's this little eatery tucked inside a market, no frills.  You order at the counter and they call you when it's ready.  I had the whole rotisserie chicken which comes with pita, garlic sauce, and a huge plate of lettuce, pickles, and tomato.  Since I was being so adventurous, I opted for a soda.  Altogether, about $9.  The food was great, almost spectacular.  I literally ate the ENTIRE chicken with most of the extras.  It was that good.  My dining partner has the Iraqi Plate, which looked amazing, and judging by the amount of conversation (nil), I can only conclude that it was delicious as well.  I can't wait to try more things here and eagerly await my next visit!  Oh, and if you're looking for desert, you can walk outside the market and hang a right or left and pick up some crack, heroin, or maybe even a lady-friend for a few minutes of after-dinner relaxation in a nearby alley.

If you're super fat and the only thing you care about is getting your 5000 calories in for lunch, this place is your Mecca.   If you haven't smoked your taste buds away, have eaten real Asian food, or actually give a shit about what you put into your mouth and body, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.

A big let down.  Lacking any good BBQ spots near the Scottsdale Rd. / Shea area, I was excited to try Dickie's when I saw it had opened.  I gathered a couple meat-eating co-workers and headed over for lunch.  I got the three meat plate, two sides for $10.99.  Not a bad price for BBQ, I figured.  Not a bad price, that is, if it's GOOD bbq... this was not good.  First their meat portions were tiny compared to what I get at Cooper's BBQ in Gilbert.  Second, the meats did not have a good, bbq'd taste, they were plain and frankly, the brisket was kind of gross.  The side of beans were so-so and the fries definitely tasted "fast-foodsy", if that makes sense... they had that weird, added crap on them.  Third, their BBQ sauce was VERY watery and pretty much sucked.  Fourth, they only had one size drink, this mammoth 32-oz yellow cup made of hard plastic.. not very enviro. friendly, or cost effective i'd imagine.  Then they punish the water drinkers by providing a little dixie cup.  This place sucks and I should have known going to a chain-bbq spot was a bad idea, but I just had to try it.  Note for gluten-free eaters, their BBQ sauce is gluten-free.

Three words:  Fuck this place.  If it wasn't for the fact they carry gluten-free/dairy-free coconut milk Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, Tamari Wheat-Free Soy Sauce, Hemp Milk, Boston  Baked Beans, Brown rice in bulk, Blueberry gluten-free waffles, and a variety of bulk spices and flours, I would never shop here.  With the exception of the checkout clerks, the rest of the staff is not only completely worthless, they are, for the most part, grumpy ass holes.  ESPECIALLY the managers.  I tried doing a special order one time to purchase a case of large bottles of Tamari soy sauce.  Haha, oh what a fail.  They never called me, like they said they would when it arrived, so I finally called to inquire.  "We've got it in", the manager said, "come on down.".  Sweet.  I get in my car, drive down there and what do you know, they don't have it.  Wtf?  The guy looked everywhere and 35mins later, we agreed it was lost and I ordered another case.  Well, 2 weeks later, again, no phone call on their part, I called and they said it was in.  When I got there I asked to open the box to check my order, and what do you know, they ordered the wrong product.  They ordered the low-sodium (which needs to be cooled) instead of the regular.  Fuck it, I took it anyway.  We have had to return four (4) packages of beef that went sour before the sell-by date.  FOUR!  Each time greeted by an unapologetic, seemingly annoyed manager.  We were never offered anything in exchange for our troubles.  The third time I told the guy that not only was he going to refund my $$, he would also be comping my package of fresh beef, which he did, but after a bit of an argument.  A few days ago I was in the store and asked the manager if he had any chocolate syrup other than "Fat-free / Sugar-free" syrup (loaded with Splenda!) and he sort of chuckled and said, "No, we're a health-food store", like a pompous cock.  I said to him, "well, real sugar is certainly better for you than fake chemical sweeter" to which he again chuckled and said, "whatever, I'll make sure to let our people know" in an extremely condescending manner.  I just laughed.  First, this guy can only be described as the opposite of healthy.  Second, their store is FULL of sugar candies, IN BULK!!  Third, Splenda is hardly "healthy" for you.  Fucking idiot.  So yeah, avoid this store, if you can.  Unfortunately, it would be more of a major inconvenience for me to avoid it, so I suffer the pain.  Oh, and don't bother asking a floor guy anything, they're COMPLETELY worthless as well.

I was very impressed with this place.  I arrived at 12:15pm on a Thursday and there was a line out the door.  After a short wait we were shown our table and served a small bowl of what tasted like Tom Yum broth.... nice little appetizer.    The menu was nice and had a lot of tasty-looking items along with a fairly large lunch menu, priced at $7.95 which gets you entree, rice, and egg roll.  You can substitute brown rice also for about a buck.  Our order was taken fairly quickly, but our food took forever to come out.  The place was packed and they were swamped, so I can understand, but if you are on a strict time schedule, this might be a problem for you.  My Drunken Fried Rice with chicken arrived looking great.  Plate was nice, presentation was attractive.  After one bite I was like, "wow, this is really good".  The fried rice plate was very good.  Chicken was perfectly cooked, very tender and moist, veggies were crisp and fresh, and the dish was spicy, but not overboard (note:  I ordered it "spicy").  Another huge bonus for those of us who don't consume milk products and love Thai Tea is the fact they have soy milk!  Awesome.  I'm anxious to try more dishes here, but if you're a fried rice fan, you are sure to appreciate this place and if you're a dairy-free Thai Tea fan, you're sure to love this place.

Don Matesz's Barefoot Health Care Center is an amazing place of healing.  Don combines his expert knowledge of Traditional Chinese medicine with an expert knowledge in holistic nutrition to offer services that will change your life.  The clinic is centrally located in Phoenix near 32nd and Indian School and is centrally located to most of the valley.   His pricing is incredible and so cheap you don't need to worry about the hassles of medical insurance.  He works on a sliding scale based on your current financial situation.... basically you pay what you can afford, based on the honor system.  Don's goal is to help you get better, not to get rich.  I can not recommend this place enough.... if you are in pain, taking medications, or are facing surgery, go here first.

For a place that bills itself as a place for healthy dining, it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Their salad is romaine or iceberg, not exactly a healthy "mixed greens" selection.  Their raw veggies are "ok" but their salad dressings are far from even decent and contain a LOT of ingredients.  Their soups are not good for you either, one of them, the veggie chili I believe, listed oil as the second ingredient.. no joke.  For anyone with food allergies or who prefers not to eat specific foods like wheat or dairy, this place is a nightmare.  The managers know nothing about the ingredients and have to print the ingredients from a computer for every single item you have questions about.  Most of the cooked food is loaded with dairy and gluten.  Plus they charge $9.99 for the salad bar and like $2.50 for a drink!  bunk.

Tasty, better than average Mexican food.  I hit this place up on lunch with a coworker and we were both pleasantly surprised.  Their food is all made from scratch (except tortillas), tasty, and seemed fresh.  Prices were reasonable and definitely worth it.    You walk up to the counter and order, then they bring it out to you.  I had their Carnitas "Guadalajara" Style... when I asked the owner "What is Guadalajara style?" he replied "Guadalajara style means they're the best carnitas you will ever have".  Well, how could I say no to that?  Turns out they are slow cooked carnitas, done proper, then deep fried before serving... haha, so good.  I won't say they were the BEST carnitas I've ever had, but they were probably tied for best..... although a bit greasy, obviously.  The beans and rice are nothing special, however the hot sauce and corn tortillas were spot on.  This place is definitely an addition to my lunch rotation.

I too stood in line for 20-25mins and gave up, but went back later in the week and was pleasantly surprised.  The first time and bad experience was the 2nd day they were open and they were clearly overwhelmed.  I had the Taiwanese Rice Noodles and they were fantastic.  Great price too, $4.95.  I enjoyed my noodles with a lychee slush with boba and was one happy guy.  They do not have every item on the menu, only about 1/5 while they are getting started.  I look forward to the full menu.

Great neighborhood sports bar.  They've got something like 35 HD TV's  all arranged so you can get a good view no matter where you sit.  The staff is friendly, drinks are inexpensive (like $10.00 for 1 beer and 2 vodka/soda), and their food is tasty.  They have a large comfy outdoor seating area if you want to catch some fresh air.  My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.  I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.  Oh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game you're interested in listening to, not that it matters when the band is playing, but every other time it's cool.

I grew up down the street from Little Saigon in The O.C. and this place is just as good as anything I had there. Even better since it's 4mi from the crib. Seriously, their soup is AMAZING. I used to say Pho Ao Sen was my favorite, and, don't get me wrong, it's good, but this place is REAL GOOD.   On top of the great food, the staff is 110% TOP NOTCH. That place is run with precision and the owner is not only very knowledgeable about their fresh good food, he's one of the nicest guys I have ever met. The staff really makes this place, IMO, it just so happens that they have BOMB PHO.  I go here at least 1x's a week, sometimes more.  Oh, and if you have food allergies, they are 100% on point and can direct you toward items that don't contain gluten.

I've eaten here almost 1x's a week for 3 years, it's very good!  They have a typical middle eastern menu... gyros, kabob, pita, salads, and of course hot dogs. They also sell bryer's ice cream and do shakes and floats as well.  Their plates are a nice size, moderately priced, and most importantly, very tasty.  I usually get a plate with 1/2 chicken kabob, 1/2 gyros with fries, salad, and rice for $10.50 or so.  My coworkers always get the gyros sandwich with fries and a drink for about $8.  The two brothers who own this place are real nice guys and care about their customers.  I highly recommend this place.

mmmmmm Kabob.  I enjoyed this place and will go back, perhaps today.  They serve Lebanese style meats with rice and pita.  They've got a great lunch special which comes with 4 different types of meat, rice, salad and pita for like $6.50!  Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh.  My only complaint was some of the meats were a little bland, but not too bad, I just like a LOT of flavor.

A very solid and very tasty Mexican spot.  For Mexican food, this place really surprised me.  The decor is "whatever"... noting to get all excited about, but the food is good and priced well.  I had the red chili con carne, as I usually do at Mexican places and I've gotta say, it was the best I have eaten in Arizona.  Very flavorful, spicy, meat was tender and tasted great.  Rice and beans were very good also.  The only complaint I had was the corn tortillas.  I don't eat flour so I always order corn tortillas.  Some places have fantastic corn tortillas, others, not so much.... this place was the latter.  If you're in N. Scottsdale and need a new Mexican place to try, I would highly recommend this place.  It's nothing to travel great distances for since most Mexican food tastes the same, but this place does it better than most.

The last two times I have been here the place had an odd stench to it, kind of like a dirty rag... big turn off.  Also, the food did not taste as good.  Since I usually order the exact same thing here, I know how it should taste.  Perhaps the bad smell skewed my taste buds or something.  I will probably not go back.

This place was great in every aspect;  food, decor, service, and price.  We did their 7 course beef meal for two and were pleasantly surprised.  Each dish was very different and unique employing a wide variety of very fresh ingredients and taste combination.  It was the perfect amount of food for two people, bordering on too much.  Service was spot on.  Very attentive, friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable about their dishes and how they are traditionally consumed.  I am anxious to return and try their 7 course fish dinner.

Garbage.  This is your typical AZ, Korean owned/run, sushi + "Asian fusion", quantity over quality sushi joint. Don't let the Korean comment sour you. There are a few very good Korean sushi places here in AZ, but they're few and far between. If you don't know the difference between a Korean sushi place and a Japanese sushi place, simply add 3 stars to my rating and stop reading now.  For most people, this place will be just fine, but if you are a big sushi fan and have a lot of experience eating sushi, you will be disappointed.  The good: - Water  The Bad: - Green Muscles were mushy in the center and, frankly, tasted bad and old. - Fresh chopped wasabi was not good. How this is possible, I have no idea. - PONZU SAUCE ON EVERYTHING!! WTF? I want to taste the damn rice, how in the hell can I taste the rice if it's drowning in Ponzu sauce? EPIC FAIL. - Fish pieces on Nigiri and Sashimi were WAY too big and too thick and threw the ratio off.  I left about 15 pieces of sushi on the table. This is the first time something like this has ever happened. Again, if your idea of good sushi is an evening of "Uber AZ Rolls" or any roll with ingredients more than rice, seaweed, single fish, go here, eat, have fun. If you refuse to soil soy sauce with wassabi and dip your nigiri upside down in the soy sauce, avoid this place like the plague.

The Pho was good (not the BEST, but very good), veggies were fresh, lime-chank was superb, spring rolls were tasty...............  Wait, wtf, fuck the review, seriously... a good bowl of Pho for like $3.50, why are you still reading this and not eating Pho?

SOLID Thai food. Some of the best I've had outside of Chang Mai. The best part about it? It's an amazing Thai spot IN DOWNTOWN MESA. Yeah, I'm sure you've been hearing a lot of DTMesa lately... you know, the awesome comic book store, Evermore Nevermore, the new grindhouse called The Royale, Bak'd, SHIT'S BLOWING UP! So now you can go get great Thai food, shop, buy some art, some vintage clothing, and catch an ultra-gore slasher flick all in Downtown within two blocks. Amazing transformation and having a sick Thai spot just makes things sweeter.  Only complaint is it's a bit pricey, but I'm rollin' in dough so IDGaF.

The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is due to it's lack of consistency. I've eaten here 7 times.  First three times, STELLAR. Soooooooooo good. Next two were take out. The pork was charred black and almost not edible. The second take out they just completely forgot to add the salad. Sixth time, AMAZING.  So for my seventh time I decided to take my wife. She's pretty picky so I usually like to vet places for her before bringing her. We arrived at 8:15pm, were seated immediately and waited OVER 1HR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES for our food. Apparently they ran out of shit or something, I don't know, nor do I care. They gave us free apps and took a substantial part off of our bill, so I forgive them.  Try it, hopefully you'll be there on a good day because when t's good, IT'S GOOD.

Save your money and your time... your taste buds will thank you.  I'll start with the service.  Pretty lousy actually, even for a Korean place.  I had to actually get up and request soybean paste b/c I couldn't wait any longer.  Crappy service.  The side dishes lacked flavor and pizazz.  Totally unimpressed.  The BBQ meat lacked flavor and more importantly, tasted BOILED.  I'm not kidding my first impression was Yoshinoya beef bowl (Cali folks will understand this), seriously.  I saw no physical indication of bbq'ing, nor did it taste like it.... the bottom of the iron dish was filled with liquid like they had just removed it from boiling water.  We also got this specialty rice bowl with beef and veggies was only good when smothered in hot sauce.  Totally unimpressed and will not come back.

Stopped in during their 2nd day open and they were totally packed, but not too packed due to the size of the store, the layout, and the amount of employees on the floor.  The highlight was the coffee table touch pcs they had scattered throughout the store.  I think they had either 4 or 6, I can't remember.  In addition to the coffee table pcs they had a very impressive video wall hooked up to a bunch of XBOX 360's.  They also had a 103" touchscreen computer in their "theater" area at the back of the store with Microsoft Earth or whatever the hell they call their map product.  I could see some sweet Forza or Guitar Hero tournaments back there.  Obviously the products are Microsoft everything.  PCs, Zune, XBox, etc.  I'm not a retarded fanboy in either camp.  I realize Mac sucked until they built their OS ontop of Unix (before Unix they sucked balls).  I realize the only difference between a PC and a Mac is the Mac costs more for the exact same equipment wrapped in a shiny, white case.  I understand Macs are just as vulnerable to virii and malware as a PC is.  I realize pretty much every version of Windows sucks ass.  I have computers running Vista x64, WinServer 2003, WinXP, Ubuntu, K-Ubuntu, and have a Mac Book Pro on order.  That being said, if you can leave the lame fanboy shit at home, you should enjoy the store.  Staff was totally friendly, not too many hot chicks, unfortunately, hopefully they'll step it up in that area.  It's worth a trip to check out those table-top computers which gives us a glimpse into the future.  They've got a pretty fun 4-person spaceship strategy game that's a lot of fun.  You may notice my 1st place score on the back stand-up to the right of the register.  It's worth a look for sure, even if you have never purchased, and plan on never purchasing, a piece of MS software for the rest of your life, like me.

Tweekers, drunken Indians (feather not dot), old fat prostitutes attempting to recruit new talent, Mexican mafia thugs, Metal Mulisha white-boys, random dudes puking their guts out in the parking lot by 8pm, swingers trying to pick up everything in sight, bar fights, some ridiculously phat bar tenders/servers (and some slobs).... I'm sure you think I'm talking about Heaven at this point, but you are wrong.  The Gym OWNS Casa Grande.

So it's the exact same menu as their place on Power / Southern only $2 more expensive for every dish. They do have gluten-free soy sauce and everything can be made gluten-free on request, just like their Mesa spot.

An entire grocery store (ok, it's more like a 7-11 in size) Gluten Free? Sweet!  This place is great.. lots of products. They also sell alternative items such as dairy-free stuff. They have a lot of kits for everything from baking muffins to dinner stuff like Hamburger Helper-style kits.  I HIGHLY recommend this place and hope they get the support they deserve.   The staff is SUPER friendly, helpful, and engaging. GO HERE AND SPEND MONEY. :)

I used to have to drive down to Guadalupe (the city not the street... well, actually, in Guadalupe, on Guadalupe, actually) for Mariscos like this, now I drive a mile or two down the street. Awesome! The wait staff is great... friendly, prompt, accommodating. I really enjoy their food and have had 3 different shrimp dishes and sampled 3 or more of the fish dishes. They are all delicious and the rice and potatoes they serve with the meals is a real treat also.   I especially like the fact that they are knowledgeable about their ingredients and can tweak a lot of the recipes to make their dairy-free. They will use oil instead of butter on request making this an easy spot for people who don't eat dairy.

Amazing... a gluten-free bakery that's not 25miles from my house! I was so stoked when Ii heard GFC was opening a second location in the East Valley (notice it wasn't in the West Valley? That's because the west-side of Phoenix sucks and is gross), even more excited when I found out it's also a sandwich place. They serve an entire menu of amazing sandwiches and now they even serve breakfast and brunch! Awesome!!

This place is awesome. Super friendly staff that don't treat comic/anime n00bs like complete asshats. You know the type... typical comic book nerd eliteists. aI spent about 30minutes with one of the guys there as he ran down all of his favorite Manga and why. He took the time to introduce me to new things and share his love of Manga and Anime with me. Because of that I was introduced to many new Manga books that I have really enjoyed. They have hella action figures too and an Xbox arcade tying in the back. SFIV anyone?

This is the only Hot Pot spot in AZ that I know of. The food is excellent along with the service. I recommend the YinYang broth as well. It's a nice leisurely dinner where you can spend a few hours eating, chatting, drinking, eating, chatting, drinking. It makes for a very pleasant experience.  I have seen a lot of "too expensive" comments. I guess it's all relative. My friend and I ate there and ordered Wagyu, lobster, rib eye, bok choy, noodles, snow pea leaves, and bamboo. We dined for 2 hours and the total bill with tip was like $25/ea. I have no problem paying that for good food and this was good food.  Now if you typically dine at Hometown Buffet, or any buffet for that matter, you may want to opt for McDonalds or an Oriental All-You-Can-Eat joint.
