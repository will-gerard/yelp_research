This place was something of a disappointment. Our server was amicable, but the wait time for the food was long, especially given that the establishment was half empty. When my pulled pork sandwich finally did arrive, the meat was bone dry and underseasoned. Fortunately, making liberal use of the array of BBQ sauces was enough to make it palatable. My companion's brisket sliders were a notch better but still nothing special, as were our sides (mac n cheese and sweet potato casserole). Eight dollars for a sandwich, side, and a drink is a fairly decent value these days, and Sticky Fingers has the right ambiance for the food it serves. However, the kitchen needs to get its act together.

Hidden in a downtown bank building, Room 112 is easy to miss. But once you take the time to find it, you will be glad that you did. The environs are dark, modern, and comfortable, the staff friendly, and the menu tantalizing with enough variety to suit many palates. My companion and I opted for gyoza, a Just Pete sushi roll (fried smoked salmon, crab, avocado, and cream cheese), a beef and vegetable stir fry, and Singapore rice noodles with chicken and shrimp. The flavors were well-balanced, the meat was tender, and everything was fresh and fragrant. This might be the best-smelling restaurant I've ever had occasion to frequent. Prices were moderate, with good-sized portions for the money: We paid $6 for the app, $10 for the sushi, and $11-$12 each for the entrees. Ultimately, one who has enjoyed a lot of Asian cuisine won't be breaking any new ground here, but what familiar favorites Room 112 offers, it does damn well.

(3.75 stars)  This charming French bakery is easy to like. The staff are friendly, there is a formidable array of coffee flavorings and baked goods, and the small outdoor patio is great for people-watching. My first journey here yielded a chai latte (better use of spices than most), a cup of homemade creamy leek soup (hearty and satisfying), a seeded roast beef sandwich (tasty, but nothing special), and a salted caramel brownie (sticky and sweet). As a lunch destination, Amelie's is no great value (the sandwich selection is small, and all are pre-made), but as a bakery and coffee shop, it's a great option.

Tiki bars evoke dated kitsch, but this Old Town Scottsdale establishment is anything but. In addition to the cool, modern ambiance, the menu offers a plethora of Hawaiian-inspired dishes with a focus on fish. A ceviche starter, for instance, delivered fresh-tasting whitefish with a pleasant citrus tang. For the land lubbers among ye, the pork dishes are also well-executed. The jerk pork is a departure from  the classic Caribbean preparation (it's a bit sweeter) but no less tasty, and purists can still rejoice at the presence of plantains.   Pricing here is reasonable (entrees in the teens), the menu is sufficiently varied, service is friendly and prompt, but there is one significant drawback: the music can be ear-splittingly loud. Catch a break in between songs, however, and you can enjoy a flavorful meal.
