Outstanding dive shop and scuba training.  I just finished my scuba certification with George from Inland Divers this morning.  These guys are extremely thorough.  They are affiliated with NAUI and go above and beyond the training requirements to make sure that you're totally comfortable going diving safely.  My wife and I bought our gear at the shop - their prices and products are excellent.  If you're thinking about getting scuba certified I wouldn't recommend going anywhere else.

I play the Palms course almost weekly and have played the Lakes course several times.  Even through the brutally hot Phoenix summer the courses are in very good shape.  If you're a beginner (or a seasoned player looking to tune-up your irons) the Lakes course has a fun layout with mostly par 3s and short par 4s.  The Palms course presents challenges for golfers at any level.

Blu is my new favorite sushi restaraunt.  The fish is always superb.  I will concede that the service can be very spotty, even during times when they're not very busy.  If you sit at the sushi bar you shouldn't have any trouble, though.  Ask the sushi chef for recommendations and he'll prepare sushi based on your personal tastes.  Chances are you won't be disappointed.

The decor and ambience was very pleasant.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.   Granted, it was a Monday night and my wife and I were only one of three parties in the restaurant.     We ordered the hot and sour soup, the puu puu platter (sp?), chicken chow mein, and the curry chicken.  Everything was terrific.  The hot and sour soup surprised me - I'm not normally a very big soup fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as left-overs the next day.     The portions of all of the orders were very big.  We had left-overs for three additional meals.

I really, REALLY wanted to like this restaurant, support it, and make it a regular fixture in my wife and my restaurant rotation.  I like that it's a family-owned and operated business and that it's right around the corner from my house.  However, I am thoroughly disappointed in Cowgirls.    My wife and I have been there on three separate occasions.  The first was when they had just opened and the place was packed.  We sat at the bar and had drinks and dinner.  The bartender was very nice and provided good service but the food was over-priced and bland.  We attributed the lack of quality to the restaurant just opening and decided to give it some time.    The second and third time we went to Cowgirls we ended up walking out after waiting at our table for over 20 minutes without the slightest attention paid to us by any servers in the restaurant.  Both times we entered the restaurant and saw a sign inviting us to "Seat Yourselves."  We found a high-top table in the bar area, sat ourselves, and waited . . . and waited . . .  Multiple times we made eye contact with servers with no acknowledgment from any of them that they would either take our order or notify our server that we were waiting.  The bartender looked in our direction, clearly noticed us sitting and waiting, but failed to send a server over to take our order.  You'd think that in the middle of a recession people working in the restaurant industry would work harder to take care of their patrons.
