Recently helped nonprofit organization fundraiser at the Secret Garden.  Venue was fabulous, but the food was scantily provided and grossly overpriced.  Picture a cheese platter with lg chunks of brie, swiss and perhaps 4lbs of bleu check crumbles with no service ware, napkins or crackers to eat this oversized wasted platter.

My husband and I were given $150 goft card by a group of teachers to show appreciation for a project we did with them. Frankly, we can't afford such expensive eateries so had never been and were slightly intimidated to go, so we saved it for special occasion.  We went ther on 6/3/16.  Decided to savor all the flavors by trying the tasting menu which cost the entire $150 card, but we decided we could afford a bottle of wine to accompany the special dinner.  When time to pay, they denied use of gift card saying it had expired. That hurt, as a couple living on SSI that hurt. So basically Christopher's got paid $150 for nothing and we were stuck with a $250 tab (including tip).  That's a rip off, taking advantage of a school teachers' gift, and two disabled customers.

Started with the YumTom soup on Cristmas eve, totally YUM.  Specials for the evening were Bankok Ribs, very ample delicious ribs, fried rice and well sauced veggies, very good.  Other special was Crispy Fish with steamed veggies veggies very good, fish was moderately good.

We had the sampler menu.  It was 9 courses of awesome. Stimulating savory sensations with each dish.  Small space, limited seating. Too early to tell what wait times will be since it's reservation based.  Sans reservations, they fit us in with only a 30 minute wait, which turned out to be well worth the wait.
