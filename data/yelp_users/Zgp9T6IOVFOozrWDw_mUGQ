This bar is based more on looks rather than authenticity of Sushi. Not that I have a problem with promoting ambiance, but I'm more about authenticity and dive places. Additionally the service was rather shoddy and IMHO rather racist. There was definitely a perceptible difference in  service to people of the brown leaning as compared to the paler people. I've been told that's a Phoenix mentality ( but I still thinks it's absolutely wrong).  As for  the sushi well the gaari was bitter ( a good sign that the place is unauthentic) and the slices of fish (which I ordered, tuna and salmon ) were too thick ( on the maki) and in the rolls too skimpy. Shushi doesn't have too many variables to play around  with so the way to determine its goodness is based on these parameters (also on the taste/texture of the rice). The lighting was too dim for a raw meat food joint.   The  servers were attractive though (again a sign that what they are selling isn't food)

It is indeed a sad day when I have to give a Mom and pop store the absolute minimum. But that I feel is the best I was willing to do after the experience of eating here.  There wasn't a single redeemable factor in the whole experience. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen ($9) on the menu supposed to come with 2 nigiri sushi. I got a horrible mess of a soup and super sweet inari sushi. The tonkatsu was composed of chunks of napa and bok choy and imitation seafood sticks and some old chicken. The broth was thickened with egg whites rather than pork bones and the whole thing was saturated with MSG. Needless to say it tasted horrible. Every ingredient in the bowl was old and of low quality including the ramen.   Avoid... even the service was non-existent..

I Love dive bars but this one has gotten me questioning the whole concept of it. Firstly it had a cover charge.. Fine it was supposed to have 3 live bands and I understand that we need to pay to see them. THe last band did not show up. WTF!!! they should have told me that at the door. The band that was playing was more interested in fornicating with one groupie that was there. We had to hear a whole monologue from each of the band memebers about how they deserved a dollar stuffed in their whiteys which was fine as long as they actually played a song but nooooo... we will not play until we get a dollar stuffed down our small weenies. "Then I will give a lap dance to the groupie and still not play".   Great!! and I had to be there to waste my time and money to observe this. Then I hear the last group ain't here. So I basically paid a cover charge to see drunk band members hit on groupies.   And lets not talk about the turd they served me as bar food. The grilled chicken burger turned out to be raw and the soup was well... bleech....  Why oh why do I subject myself to this mishandling... oh right I like dive bars, food joints etc.... because I believe mom and pop type establishments try their best to serve people well.....  Paradigm shift with this establishment... service was apathetic.. food well.... grungy... and music..... blase....  Truly a disappointment to my core beliefs

Are you looking for the cure for your sushi cravings? Do you wish that you could be permanently rid of your roll addiction? Then look no further than "Ah-so"... with their wide array of fetid fish, chewy seaweed, stinky rice and hot sake made from paint thinner.   This place is guaranteed to exorcise you off of anything remotely Japanese. This is the place that has the owner muttering "dumb ah-so" anytime any customer forks out money for their gut wrenching fare.   After the experience you will be sure to scream "oh my poor raw ah-so" as you crawl out  with nary a need to ever go back to associating with anything sushi like in your life

Horrible service: as per previous reviewer, I concur, the girls working on the weekend here were really horrible. I think they specifically pick them from the Juvie section.  Went here for my morning Joe, always the same   Me: "Short doppio machiato"  (lingo I learnt at other starbucks. ) Girl at counter (GaC): "Wha, Wha can't hear you"  Me: Repeated order GOC: "Wha what can't hear you!!" ,(after taking off her headphones) "Oh!, a machiato... oh yeah..."  Me: (thinking)Thank heaven for small miracles  On getting my coffee (5 minutes a tad late given I was the second in line) I guess gossiping about their boyfriends was more important. The coffee was filled to the brim with milk. Not looking good!!!  Me: Did you put milk in the machiato order? Girl who made the coffee: Yeah!! why? (rudely) Me: well machiato is only supposed to have foam. Girl: Oh.. (making a deriding face) Me: Um!! (flabbergasted at the poor service... and I thought Starbucks paid these people higher and trained them rigorously.  ) Girl: Why U want me to make it again? then mimed deridingly  below her breath "Machiato doesnt contain milk"   at this point I was quite sure she would end up spitting in my coffee or do some insidious act. So had to walk of with my milky unwanted coffee wishing I hadn't paid up front for it.

By far one of the better places for your money, to learn to dance and practice. They have something every night. There has been some upgrades to the floors and one dance room since the new management took over. The West coast swing(Robert), Salsa social (sunday, Shawn) and the Friday (Lonnie's class) are the most popular with the dance floor filling up rapidly with a wide range of and expertise of dancers. Personally I'm not a big fan of Lonnie's as his instructions are geared towards his ASU students and more towards the womens steps. (Hey! the guys are petrified when they are tasked with remembering their steps with the beats applying proper pressure for a good lead and remembering the next 2 steps so that things flow smoothly... so try spending time and effort telling us exactly what how I should be leading, instead of trying to impress the girls. For the people who disagree, try leading and I will gladly switch to a follow). But I still get to take your class right Lonnie! (sheepish)......  Watching some of the expert dancers do their "thang" can be a bit intimidating but most of the people are nice and will dance with you( and provide tips). Of the bunch of people who will not because U might be a noob (you jerks know who you are!), I say move on (after showing them a few choice gestures).  If you see a hippo gesturing oddly at girls, come on over and ask for a dance, you know I'm a noob too ;)

2 things that get me riled up against mom and pop restaurants is 1) Serving stale and potentially harmful food 2)Serving food that does not correspond to the definition in the menu.  Yangtse does this in abundance. I tried the wonton soup and the Szechuan style Dumplings. Firstly the second dish contained wontons not dumplings (I know not much difference in theory) but the wontons and the dumplings were the same.  The hot sauce (which I asked if it was Ma La) had nothing to do with authentic "Ma La". Where is my szechuan peppercorns infused yumminess .. dude..!!    The pork in the wontons/dumplings were rancid, indicating frozen for ages, reheating in the morning and serving in the evening kind of food.  Do I have to be dissuaded everytime to ever try Chinese cuisine in the valley!! Sigh...

OK high marks just go for variety, location (its near my couch potato butt) and price. The choices are mind -boggling especially for someone who likes to be adventurous in his gastronomic quests.   But the smell (hoo boy!!) that's something you have to make a conscious effort to disregard in order to prevent yourself from upchucking all over their floor. Disclaimer: If you've lived in Asia( American definition of Asia) then this might be something you are used to.  But smell aside, and language barrier aside (look for the english speaking young kids if you have any queries) they stock stuff from all over the world, South America,Africa, Asia (rest of the world definition). I go here whenever I have loads of time on my hands in order to pick out samples of food to try out. I'm currently on Argentina and Brazil.   They aslo have a variety of fresh fish ( the smell was rather detrimental in me not buying any of their stuff) and exotic parts of a cow and pig (stuff like tripe, kidneys, hoofs, lungs etc)  Don't forget to ask for their 10% off coupon at the counter. If you see a deeply engrossed shopper flitting about and putting random foods in his cart don't forget to say "Hi"

Why is this listed far away from its actual location. I can't seem to be able to check in here   Pros: Ambiance, Small Establishment (mom and popish... something I support)  Cons: Probably everything else.  This is my 5th time visiting this place and the only reason for it has been its proximity. The service has always been shoddy (subjective). I guess you have to be a regular or catch the owners eye to be given any sort of good service. As for me I got the "don't care for you" service ( even though only 4 tables were occupied during the lunch hour). I guess I must be becoming invisible.  Food: Saw the prices and was a bit surprised (asian upper class restaurant?? somewhat of an anomaly, easily double of what you get in other Vietnamese restaurants. Thought to myself the food better rock for these prices). Ordered the mint chicken, what I got was a well decorated but bland and not seasoned dish. I had to put in heaps of fish sauce and oyster sauce just to make it palatable.   What a waste of good earned cash and a bad aftertaste to boot. Hopefully in future this review will remind me never to visit this place again.

apparently they do not allow any hats or head gear unless its a cowboy or a baseball cap. Apparently they reason for not allowing a fedora  or a workers cap is it is representative of  "Gang"  paraphernalia. So I assume people who wear fedoras or worker caps are part of some gang however people who wear cowboy hats never congregate or that any "gang" members ever wear these head garbs.  When I asked what is their policy for Sikhs who have to have a turban as required by their religion, they spat saying that there was no such religion and that person would be promptly thrown out for "gang" affiliations.  So much for religious tolerance and sense of good fashion. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat with MS 13 imprinted on it, but then I might be afraid that MS13 members might hunt me down for wearing a cowboys hat with their name on it

Unfortunately after trying bad sushi joints and yes they include all you can eat sushi places I thought that I couldn't eat worse. Well how wrong was my take on that. The absolute no no in sushi is when the raw food isn't fresh. A good thumb rule is if the seafood smells more than usual its probably old. Well that's exactly what I got here.   The service was good. BTW they expect you to spend a minimum of $20

Pro: Mom Pop store (probably originally from greece) Service good, Portions large. Good tasting sauce in the pita   Cons: Ordered the Shish kabob. Got unseasoned (read no salt, brining or any basic marinated cut of beef). They used the worst part of beef hence the shish (skewered) meat was super tough still contained gristle (no trimming done) and was flavourless. Sauce though tasting good should ideally be made of only yougurt. This also had a mayolike base. Salad that came as a side was watery and tart   Sigh! another option to find my ideal eatery shattered.

I did like this place a lot. Given that it wasn't crowded when we went there we also received some good service and great recommendation from the chef. We ordered their garlic bread, the special pizza and the tiramisu topped off with the house wine.  All came out perfect. If i wanted to quibble, I would suggest a bit more seasoning (and roasting of garlic) on their garlic concoction. I wouldn't rank this above Bianco's but given that the wait time and service overall a much better experience here. Sometimes the wait times at Bianco's really get to me.

If you take a gander at my profile you'll note that I have a penchant for ingesting food that would make a normal persons' stomach turn. That's right! Andrew Zimmern(BIzzare foods fame) is a pansy  and thus, what I usually saunter in for is their Durian shake.  So if you visit this place and suddenly smell some noxious fumes , look around for a daffy, grinning bloke holding a shake.  For 3 bucks their sandwiches are awesome (only cash please... wha.??!!). Overall in the grand cosmic view of things actually "Meh". Barbeque pork is my fave but have tried most of their other varieties as well.  I 've nailed down the reason for me liking the sandwich to the pickled daikon and carrots as well as their eggy mayo that they lather in, topped with their fresh cilantro.  The meat used has always been rather tough and unappetizing.   However they have way more choices in terms of desserts smoothies baguettes. The ambience is very similar to a fast food joint in HK, South Korea etc.

Yesssshhh ! Cocina like its made in Mexico, and by that I mean the food court is authentic and yummy. The amount of meat selection is just huge and I mean replete with Tripe, Tongue, Blood slabs and all that. The Panaderia is huge as well...... "heaven"  The condiments are nice and spicy (not overt but just a little over the edge)  The prices for the groceries are pretty decent as well. Have to come back here for the avocados

As far as chinese buffets go this is definitely not anywhere near good. Sorry couldn't refrain from taking a dig at the previous reviewer.  What I heard was that this was once a decent place to visit. However it has gone downhill in the past year. The array of dishes are impressive I concede, but each individual item is horrible. I tried to sample as much as possible before coming to this judgment but alas that is how it stands. The only thing I found slightly decent was the shui mai (pork dumplings). I liked the Lotus seed bun as well( due to my ignorance) but my asian colleague informed me that it was blech... and better ones could be obtained at Lee Lee's market across the street (lee lee's is another review though).   Was feelling a bit ill at the end of the sampling frenzy (as I always do with these types of buffet). In short most of the food was old a simple test being if all the seafood smell off and the steamed dumplings have their wax  paper stuck to them.

Ordered the Bento Special plate, with Chicken BBQ, Spam,Mahi etc... but then I saw the Poke Plate (Hawaiian Sashimi) and had to have that. They were very nice to change the order without charging me the difference. They suggested I try it with the Shoyu which was a good suggestion.  Everything was really good, next time will try their other varied dishes.

I would have liked to rate them well as they are a typical mom and pop store unfortunately all the 3 times I have been there the food is passable at the best. The air is also thick with burnt wok oil which ruins ones hunger if you sit around for too long(bad ventilation).  They do have wonderful service and generous portions, but that has never been a redeeming feature for restaurants.  So far I have tried the Kung pao, the Singapore noodle and the firecracker

Geographical proximity has always been a bane for my proclivity for good authentic exotic food. Needless to say that has never stopped me from trying all the close establishments. Chinese food being one of my favored cuisines led me to be easily convinced to accompany me colleagues to this joint. The first impression was quite decent. Also the fact that it was once a Vietnamese establishment that catered to wedding parties gave it a pseudo garish pomp. Ordered the egg[plant steamed fish, green beans... while friends ordered the kung pao, lemon chicken (oh lawrdy!! bleah...). Not bad not bad , I mused to my self and put it down as another place to revisit.  However every subsequent  revisits here has been a horrible experience in terms of food. At one point I managed to peek at "non-chinese" cooks making our dishes. Sigh! one of those precipitously  "going bad" joints, ratified by their 6 health code violations. Ah well on to Swadee...

Disappointing to say the least.... This is my 4th time here and I wouldn;t have gone here so many times if it wasn't the proximity to MCC. Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times.  This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.  Note to self: Never venture here again

Ambience: Ordinary, The owner is afghani and his wife(?) is turkish Food: Hmmm since this is my first tryst with Afghani food so I wasn't sure if the food was authentic or not. My take on it is: Aush (beef yougurt soup with mint, garlic etc) A bit too tart for my liking otherwise sublime ( I'm also assuming less spicy than usual) Aubergines(or Eggplant), again too tart for my liking and less impressive than the indian version( more caramelizing of ingredients in the Indian one). Afghani naan: seemed home made but tough and chewy always a bad bread ( which naan is essentially) recipe. Turkish coffee: good   Service: Good and very helpful though I suspect they were a bit wary of all the questions I asked  Second Try: A resounding failure. Went in for the Lunch buffet and was hoping to get sone good nosh seeing their choice spread. However each item was poorly made. Their Lamb soup with lentils had gone rancid ( and was to cause me to taste this meal several times that day). The only think which I found slightly edible was their kabab which had become tough ( I think they had laid it out for too long, even though the time was only 12:45 pm).

Ah the previous owner sold this joint (to the people from Woodlands?).. how surprising given the poor quality of food they dished out.  Now this is a much better Indian fare. With comparison to NY or any other decent place this falls short. But for chandler with all its Intel and Freescale population it is probably currently one of the better ones in the vicinity. So not surprisingly most of the patrons sport an Intel and Freescale badge... my my I would never have guessed.  On to more serious stuff like FOOD... Well I would say 70%  of the dishes are decent. Unfortunately Its hard to discern which ones. I had to sample each item m in their buffet (lunch) to come to that conclusion.  I'll harp on the bad...The Chettinad chicken was horrible, the dal makhni was "meh"... and the  paneer was swimming in oil. Of these I can excuse the dal and paneer... but Chettinad... shame... what a poor representation, given that the owner is... well not from Tamil Nad.. but nearby.  However the desert was different ... yippee  and the eggplant good....lovely....  Will have to go there once again but I'll try the a-la-carte dinner, that should foment my decision

Pro: Lovely ambiance, and Service staff. Felt like and upper end restaurant, something which typical Vietnamese restaurants do not offer  Cons: Well the food was insipid and bland. The pho tasted like salted water with a touch of broth. The condiments like sweet basil etc were dry and flaccid. I would hope that Nam pla was a default accoutrement for most authentic Vietnamese restaurants. I counted 3 meatballs and a few slivers of the rare beef pieces. The quantity was smaller than most other ones I have tasted in the area. Ah well I don't feel too bad as I can trundle on down to Saigon Pho for the better deal and food

Came in here famished and wanting their Soup noodles. However the service was rude and deceptive. I wanted to seat at a normal table as opposed to the sushi bar, the initial reaction from the waitress was one of derision since I had come in alone.   They were supposed to seat me at a side table which they made me wait for while they cleaned it up. After having got it cleaned they magically claimed that another couple( that knew the manager and came after me) was waiting for it and proceeded to give it to them. I could gone back to the sushi bar but the whole experience left  a bad taste and had made me lose my appetite.   I guess bumping off a customer for a known one makes sense in some weird sense but it just is a sad way to run a business

The low down: Service: Good, sometimes really good if you are a returning customer and Etgar has his eye on you.  Price: Pricey for what food/quantity  you get   Food: unfortunately terrible. I have been here several times and have always found that the sauces/ dips (Ex: Tzizaki Hummus etc ) have been quite bitter. I don't how how one can consistently have bitter food for 2 yars now and still not correct it. They also used to have decent tomato (with carrots) soup. Of late it has become more carrot and badly seasoned. Speaking of seasoning this is another problem that they seem to be having. I'm sure the cook never tastes anything he puts out (or maybe they are short on basic seansoning, or in a more positive light maybe they have an agenda to reduce salt intake for all humankind)   For Mediterranean food I would rather go to Pita Jungle about 2 miles east of this place. This is not a shout out for Pita... but more of a disappointment with Spices

What seems funny is that people like Sushi kee which is the same owner and they keep switching venues. I am a big fan of Sushi (sake with Avocado). The service may be a bit slow but if I have'nt had any problem as I sit by the sushi bar. Beats the Got Sushi anyday but then so does every other sushi joing in the valley.

Yup poor service converted the rating to a 1 star. No Lauren wasn't good, waited 20 minutes at the bar and made eye contact twice wasn't asked for what I would like to drink at all.   Eventually my kind neighbor got up and called out her name and then she asked me what I wanted. No apology, nothing.  Walked out without ordering anything. Thanks for spoiling my weekend Jenny and ensuring that I never come back.

I really wanted to like this place s the owner was very nice but at the end of any Gustatory  transaction the thing of importance is the food. Maybe I should have heeded Aileen's suggestion of going really early but instead I went there during lunch time (12:30 ish). I must say the Mung bean pastry (mongo monia??)  was horribly dry and hard which was the only baked good I tried. Of their fresh cooked fare I tried the Pancit Palabok and the Vegetable Lumpia. The noodle dish  was seriously bland and the noodles soggy. The vegetable Lumpia was dripping in oil. Such a disappointment... sigh have to try a little further .. maybe Jeppens...

Well I must have chosen the worst dish that day. How sad, this place has a wonderful set of authentic tiwanese items. I ordered the spicy wonton ( Which strangely had "Ma La" sause/oil poured on top of it. Now I am a sucker for mala so I did like the dish even though the pork and shrim inside was rather bland ( me thinks an addition of some garlic/leek or ginger might do the trick). Also ordered the Taro Boba (without ice) which was fine , a tad on the sweet side for my taste but to each his/her own.  The Hainan chicken was however just horrible. The chicken was definitely semi rancid and both the rice and chicken were soaking in oil. I was hoping the ginger,garlic, onion sauce would redeem this but sadly that too was dissapointing.  an extra star for the potential. I hope to go back and order a more safer choice and hopefully redeem my impression of this high potential joint.

Any place that does not allow headwear (like caps or hats) in my mind is segregating out people who have to wear that for whatever reason like religion or for covering up some disfigurement. I knwo several friends that fall under this category. If they are barred from this establishment then I too do not care to patronize it.

A new low for any mom and pop stores. Exemplary for when one shouldn't open up a restaurant. The kitchen was filthy as were all the kitchen equipment.There was so many things wrong with this place that I will only put a synopsis  Food was horrible. Management and service was terrible. No health inspection score posted and the kitchen and establishment reflects it. My new comparisons for all restaurants will be "is it worse than New China?"  I would recommend this place to all my enemies or to people looking for cheap explosive enemas.

Really flavourful and light  phos/soups  made here. This is the reason that I like Mom and pop stores. They don't leave you feeling like a greasy  over stuffed cow. I keep ordering the tapioca noodle soup as I haven't seen many places that offer that on the menu.  Next time I'll try the rice dishes. They looked yummy when the next couple ordered it.

Given the amount of times I visit Starbucks I usually do not write any reviews unless the service/drink/food falls in the two extreme spectrum. Unfortunately this falls in the the lower side due to the rather shoddy service and their huge turnover of front facing barista's which make ordering the basic combination of a simple latte feel like pulling teeth. I keep forgetting how frustrated I feel every time I come back here once every few years(enough time for poor previous service amnesia). Oh well another 2-3 years before I mistakenly stumble here again methinks...

Eek! methinks not is damn about right. Ordered the make your pasta item with chicken pesto and angellini pasta and the tiramisu.   One of the worst Italian foods I have had and the chicken was definitely rancid (I am quite sure that it hadn't been stored at the right temperature and had been lying there collecting salmonella for quite some time).  The tiramisu was such a disappointment what happened to the layers of ladyfinger and the delicate touches of coffee.  This reminds me of the time I tried watching Gigli.  The only saving grace was the history of the owner(displayed on theor menu) who allegedly was a thief and a bum. Seems like he was known for making business fail. How ironically true....

Yes the owner is really nice and they do have a really old grocery store (which means most of the ethnic stuff they are selling are old)  But commenting on the food, I had the baba ganoush and the Kefta kebab. The ganoush was bitter (methinks came out of can with citric acid and other preservatives imparting the bitter taste) The Kefta wasn't that bad (but I have had better) however the: tzatziki enveloping the kefta was bitter. I have found the same phenomenon in Spices on the other side of 101.   Either that is how it is made or else they both are using canned stuff to feed to us.

Woohoo!!! finally a really authentic Chinese noodle joint. I was lucky enough to get the info from my colleague on Friday, who saw it (where else) but in a Chinese bulletin board (damn my inability to understand mandarin properly). So couldn't wait to get to try it out. I must say it didn''t disappoint. It did take me some time to find it as it is hidden away in the East corner of the Lee Lee's complex (BTW this complex is AWESOME with a wide variety of Pho, Boba, Chinese and Fillipino eateries .. Heaven!!). I ordered the Beef noodle soup (with the pulled noodles). You get to see the kitchen chefs making the noodles in front of you; another good indication of freshness.  Yummy!, it was a more flavorful version of Pho with salted cabbage (one thing I really like). Next time I hope to try the Seafood noodle soup with some of the "marinated"egg.  Caution: They do not take credit cards if you spend less than $10.

----Update------Down to 4 stars from 5 I'm still optimistic about this place even though of my 3 times here I saw the servers flubbing up the orders (one of them being mine). Additionally the beef slices (in the beef and oyster sauce noodle) was chewy, mostly due to using cheap cuts of beef(highly probable) and overcooking it (possibly). Of the dishes I tasted, the best is the Pork with Shaved noodles. The spicy beef tenders was a disappointment (its supposed to be Ma la) but didn't get any of the sichuan peppers numbing, on eating this.

Quality of ingredients have gone down sharply. They have stopped cleaning the veggies (found dirt on my veggies) and shrimps in my seafood soup were not cleaned. The squid had a rancid taste to it. The quantity of meat in the noodle soups have gone down sharply. All I get are the noodles with just a slight amount of meat. Ah well strike this off my list of possible places to eat.

Honestly I wasn't too impressed with the food. Someone told me that the sandwiches were awesome especially their chopped liver. Firstly the menu is just humongous it took me a good 10 minutes just to scan it. On finding the chopped liver sandwich I ordered that but made the error of asking the waitress for the accompanying bread (which she suggested as rye). SO I ended up ordering the half chopped liver with rye.  The chopped liver was piled quite high but the sandwich was quite small for the 7 bucks. However I like small portions so this didn't bother me too much Mimi's across the 101 serves similar portions and I don't ind paying for it. However the combination of the sweet rye and gamey chopped liver made the sandwich rather disgusting.  Next time if I go back I'm, getting the corned beef with challlah or onion pocket.

Lowdown :Really greasy and bad tasting sandwich  Just noticed that Lukes had opened inthe place of the greek restaurant next to paradise bakery. On walking in I noticed that the choice of sanwiches was compact, which was good I had only a few things to choose from, beef, sausage or egg and some combination of these.  Asked for the egg and peppers sanwich. For people conversant in cooking they will know that making good tasting egg requires precision. Sadly this was lacking in the product I got. The egg was overtly salty but the peppers and onions were not seasoned. Any ametuer cook knows that it should always be the opposite. Also by choosing the egg/peppers combo it allowed me to see how greasy the bun was that it came in (never a good sign).   I'm sure all these would have been masked had I gone with the meat offerings. I also agree that the service sucks if not for the son? Josh.

Well I have to agree with previous reviewers about the rather rude waitresses, but that has never really stopped me from trying out and liking establishments. Food taste and authenticity is more of my "thing". I had tried this place earlier as a coworker swears by this place ( Midwest American). I have really never been impressed or dissuaded enough to yelp about it. In all honesty I think that I should have tried their a-la carte menus which had a bunch of authentic (ask for the cantonese menu) dishes. However I decided to go for the buffet.   Simply horrible is all that comes to mind. All of the dishes had that "left out for several hours" taste and texture. Both their soups were just horrible. All the items (of which only half of them were replenished) were americanized hurriedly prepared soaking in oil, dishes with chewy meat.The fried rice was rather decent; the only redeeming factor.   I pity my coworker who eats this waste of comestibles, almost every day.

Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation.   The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was " Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.  Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food.   Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier.   Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste...

No the Kung Pao chicken is not awesome (colon ,open bracket). This is the staple americanized chinese cuisine with one base sauce ( soy,sugar,rice vinegar, garlic) and just simple deviations to obtain the various dishes.   You will get the same stuff at Panda express or any other generic americanized chinese eatery. Base your need to visit on the price differential if you want.  I also enquired about some of the dishes in order to acertain any hidden "special" (read authentic) dishes, but was sadly dissapointed.  Extra star(as ususal) for Mom-Pop eatery.

Service: 5 star Food: 1 Star (redeemed by their Vietnamese fare else negative) Mom and Pop store: Check Price: Cheap = 4 star  I would have given this  a 2 star at most if it wasn't for the service. Their Chinese Kung pao was dreadful (sweet and tough chicken). I should have stuck with the Vietnamese spread (but had pre-ordered from their online menu). The service was really good and the place was really clean and almost "American" diner looking.

FAIL!! This Filibertos openend recently in place of Church's chicken. They still seem to be having problems with the chef as I walked in on the conversation where the teller was explaining to the cook how to make the chicken. Not a good sign at all. I decided to get the green chile as I typically do, it came out in less than 2 mins (not a good sign at all).  Wow the chef had just gone to task with adding salt and making the chicken mushy.   Royal fail .. Avoid like a plague.. I know its a filibertos but atleast get the franchise recipe down. Now as to the freshness of the product.. well that is something I never question at a Filibertos

The Rating is just a stop gap till I try it out. haven't really tried it out yet. Heard about it from a "close" friend. Went in on a Saturday evening and found it somewhat crowded. This used to be an Italian restaurant. The ambiance was decent, but wasn't really hungry enough to sit down and eat. Will try it the next time I am around the vicinity

For Chandler this is a really good location for Szechuan food. I love their cold entries where you can go to the display and choose 3 for $6. I usually get the "Fuqi Feipian" and the beef tenders and any other dish. This with some rice is  good for lunch and some.   Finally a place to get my "Ma La" fix.
