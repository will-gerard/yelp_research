This place is fantastic!  They have supplies to suit the most imaginative of bakers!  I also feel they have great pricing.  I have seen similar items at other supply stores for up t twice the price.    The staff is incredibly helpful too!   These ladies know what they are talking about.

I live sandwiched between Ace and Home Depot.  This review is a long time in the making, but well worth the wait.  A while back I was a Home Depot shopper, on my last visit into "do it your self hell"  I was treated so badly by their rude staff I have never been back!    Going into Ace has been a polar opposite. The staff here are awesome!  They answer my questions no matter how crazy they might be and are very helpful in the process.   I really can't say enough good things about this place called ACE.

This place is fantastic! There is a reason it has been around as long as it has!  I have nothing bad to say about this place... At all!  The service was fantastic.  The food left me wanting to lick my plate.  The goat cheese nachos were to die for, the lamb chops ere some of the best we have had.  The wine was intoxicating and when we mentioned it was our first time there the waiter brought us out a couple different desserts to try!    I will go back again, and again, and again!!!!!!

I absolutely love hate this place. The velvet is something I wake up craving in the morning. The pastries and food are so freaking good. The location is perfect. If i can swing going super early in the morning then the atmosphere is great. But venture in at the same time as the hipster masses and I feel out of place. The line is out the door and the process is awkward like you need to be in the know to know what is going on because no one tells you! This is where the hate part come from. My husband will not come here with me because of how crowded it is. But the velvet calls my name and I will reluctantlly be back.

I miss this place something terrible right now. I wish there was something even half as good as this where I live now. I never realized how spoiled I was till moving away. The low carb Pizza, the regular pizza, the caprese sandwich. It's all so delicious I am daydreaming of flying home just to eat it.   I met the owner during one of my MANY visits and he was crazy nice but the girls who answer the phones are usually snotty. That is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.

I had dinner here last week.  We went on Thursday night and there was a 45 min wait.  Good sign I thought!  I have no problem waiting for great food.  We took a seat on their patio and ordered a drink.  I ordered one of their signature cocktails with strawberry's and basil.  The waiter warned me that the drink was very strong and sweet,  since I like strong drinks I went for it.  This drink was terrible. TERRIBLE!!!! Not to mention I had to shell out about 12 buck with tax and tip for this undrinkable concoction.  Let me just say I am not dissatisfied because it was overly strong or sweet.   But rather because it was disgusting.  This is where St Fancis loses one full star from me.    Once we were seated our server was very attentive and nice.  We were seated at a table right inside the door next to a lager table set into this glass alcove.  It looked very cool but once the birthday party with eight ladies took their seats this alcove turned into a megaphone projecting everything this group of ladies said right into our faces.  It was so uncomfortably loud that it was actually painful to my ears.  I found myself holding a hand over the ear closest to them.   We could hardly hold  a conversation.  I ordered a salad to start and requested it without the bacon, the kitchen either did not get this request or overlooked it, because my salad arrived covered in pig.  The goat cheese appetizer was pretty good. The forbidden rice and the pork chop were excellent.  If I were only reviewing our entrées then this place would have gotten five stars.     All in all we dropped around $100 for two people.  I am in no hurry to eat here again.  Although the entrées were so tasty that I may be inclined to order just those again to go!

I brought my good friend here to find out about flowers for her upcoming wedding.  I live in the area and am a big fan of supporting local businesses.  We walked in the door and there were boxes everywhere!  I thought we had accidentally went into a warehouse.  No employees in sight!  Just as we were ready to walk back out the door a woman approached us.   The "show room" was so much like a warehouse that I asked if we were in the right place for wedding flowers.  She gave me a short yes.  Mind you there is not one flower in sight.  I asked her to educate us on buying flowers for an upcoming wedding.  With a Chloe purse full of Scottsdale attitude right here in my beloved non-snobish neighborhood, she responded with "Well am I going to sell you flowers or are you here to copy what we do and make it yourself?"    Whoa.... WTF are you kidding me?!  Listen lady have you ever heard of this thing called the internet?  If we wanted to do flowers our-self we can read all about that from the comfort of our houses in our PJ's and not waste time talking with you and your tude!     After defending our intentions she sat down with us to talk flowers.  She showed us pictures and gave some nice suggestions upgrading this review from a one star to a two.  I could see from her note pad on the table that they do some huge money events and from the pictures I saw it looks like they do a nice job.    Bottom line it's not my call where the bride buys her flowers, but if it were up to me I would move on to somewhere with a high standard for service in addition to high standards for flowers.  I personally would not return or recommend them, unless you like to be treated like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman on her first trip to Rodeo Drive... "Big mistake. Big. Huge."

This little gem is quite tasty!  It is a little hidden in an obscure strip mall, but totally worth it.  The owner is super nice! The food is not your typical Americanized Mexican is very tasty and delicious!

What a delicious surprise at the Mesa Arts Festival!  I have been dreaming of a place to get a veggie dog with interesting and mouth watering toppings for as long  as I can remember!  I was a little surprised when I was handed my dog wrapped in pita bread, but it was better than a bun. I will be tracking this one down again and again!

Yum!  Tried this place for the first time last night and I will be back!   I will say I wish there was a sign down stairs directing you where to go, it was a little confusing at first.   The patio seating offers great views and you are protected from the setting sun.  They have a FANTASTIC beer selection.  I mean it.  I am rarely impressed by beer menus and this one did it for me.   I started off with the cheese plate, loved the presentation and the cheeses.  They were not what you usually get around town.  I only wish they came with an explanation of what was what.   The Apple Gorgonzola salad with the warm balsamic was delicious.  We barely had room left to try a bite of the Red Goat pizza, but let me tell you a bite is all that was needed to ensure a return visit for more.  I can't wait to go back and try the other menu options.

I too found Rob on Yelp.  I called to make an appointment and he was able to come out the next morning.  Don't judge me but I had some particularly nasty pet stained and coffee stained white carpet.  I was moving out of a rental and figured there was no way I would get my deposit back even after I had the carpets cleaned.... That is until Rob showed up,  He did an awesome job, was incredibly knowledgeable and went above and beyond the average commercial cleaners that I have used in the past.  He quoted me a very fair price before he started cleaning (about half of what his competitors would have charged) and that was the same price I paid when he was done.  My carpets looked almost new and definitely better than when I moved in.   Rob even checked in with me the next day to make sure I was still happy with the results and offered to come back if I wasn't!  Talk about great service!   I would definitely recommend him to anyone, and yes I got my entire deposit back!
