I've visited a few of Frank Lloyd Wright's other buildings, and this is a pretty epic site and the Western headquarters for Frank Lloyd Wright during his day.    Although some of the buildings are dated, there's a certain aspect of modernity in his design, decades ahead of his time and aspects still being used today.   What's even more amazing was how far and remote the site was from Scottsdale and Phoenix.   Everything was transported or moved with trucks or by hand on unpaved roads. And the city and urban sprawl has creeped up to Taliesin.    Tours will require tickets, and they sell out, so book early.    Here's another tip. If you take the night tour, which is 2 hours, it goes by really quickly.  And bring BUG SPRAY. And maybe long pants. Within minutes of starting the tour, the group was a giant feeding tank for mosquitos. By the end of the tour, I had over 10 bites all over my legs.

I remember when this was one of the nicest hotels on the Strip. Like Napoleon, those days are long gone.  The rooms still have tube tvs, and some of the finishes look well worn.   The elevators reek of cigarette smoke.   The pool area has cracks on the pavement.   The customer service is good overall, but you are starting to get what you pay for.  They charge $15 a day for Internet, and $25 a day if you use it in the business center.    I went to the coffee shop to ask for a cup of hot water, and they charge $4.  Really?  You've got to be kidding.

I came here Sunday night, my last night in Vegas. This was one of my "affordable" culinary trips and a good way to end my trip.   The meal began with a warm baguette brought to the table in a paper bag. Soft and warm and very comforting.   I ordered the cold pea soup as a starter. Small chunks of vegetables, creme fraiche, swimming in a pool of a bright green pool of soup. Simply delicious.   I had the skate wing for my main dish. My biggest concern was if I'd spend the rest of the meal picking out bones between bites. Crispy and brown on top and a nice flaky interior without the bones, seasoned with salt. It sat in a pur√©e of roasted cauliflower, which was creamy and almost had a potato-like quality.

I did not know this place was a local chain. But the food was great, the service was great, and they had great hot sauce!   I ordered the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict.  That chipotle hollandaise sauce was delicious! Smoky, eggy, something I would pour on a lot of my breakfast.   Service was great.  Enthusiastic and happy staff, everyone was happy to chat, ask questions, and even get me more coffee (even when it was self service).  They also have 5 different Cholua flavors! I died and went to hot sauce heaven.

This is a pretty awesome place to stay if you need a place to decompress from the hustle and bustle of the casinos and the Strip.  All the suites have kitchens, which is awesome if you have the need to cook. Plus, eating out at so many mediocre restaurants gets old. And expensive.  The suites are modern and contemporary. The bedrooms are a nice size and comfortable.  Even though it's tucked away in the back of City Center (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you can walk to Bellagio from a walkway connected to the hotel, Aria and Cosmopolitan are walking distance next door, and the City Center Tram can drop you off at Crystals and the Monte Carlo and you're a short walk to Planet Hollywood.   Service has been superb. If you use the kitchen in the suite, housekeeping will bring you utensils AND cookware!    Overall it's been a fantastic experience staying here. I can't be more pleased.  The downside is the pool closes early, like 8pm on the weekends.    The wifi is free, which is awesome.

I came here tonight for a light dinner and a drink. I'm not a big fan of restaurants that have music blasting like it's a nightclub. If I can barely hear my bartender, it's probably far worse for those sitting at a regular table.   Service was slow in the beginning but picked up after I placed my order. My drink of choice on this night was an English Side Car. It was a touch on the sweet side, because of the apricot jam.   They brought out the (obligatory?) bread plate, which was awesomely delicious. The rolls were soft and flavorful. I really like the pinwheels.  My dinner for the evening was the fois gras. Heavenly. Soft and fatty, sitting in a pool of duck fat and bacon bits, with brioche and strawberry jam.  Great contrasts in texture and flavors.  Highly illegal, criminal if you were to order and serve in California.

Friend of mine recommended this place while I was out in the Phoenix area. Not what I expected. Who knew you could find a snow ice place like what you could find in LA all the way in Phoenix? Lots of great flavors and toppings, like strawberry and black sesame, as well as your sauce toppings, like condensed milk, chocolate, strawberry and more black sesame.   Lots of cool pop art and comic book related art on the walls. The patrons were not all Asian.  It's not even in an Asian part of town.  This place is killing it and that's not a surprise.  Not too hard to sell snow in the desert.

I came here for dinner with family while on vacation.  The food was very good, considering I didn't expect there's much ethnic food out here in the desert.    I stuck to ordering a few appetizers to try as many plates as I could.    The vegetarian spring rolls were really good.  Crisp, fresh, and a nice dipping sauce on the side.  They normally come with two, but I asked to have them cut it into 3, and they were happy to oblige.    The sweet fish sauce chicken wings were generous portion wise, and were nice mix of flavors. Sweet, salty, spicy, and sour.  I was hoping it had more of a fish sauce flavor, because the sweetness overwhelmed the dish.  Avoid ordering the Brussel sprouts.  They overcharred the veggies, and while the fish sauce offered a balance to the smokiness, there's too many bitter charred pieces. I prefer them less well done.  We also ordered a Bun Cha Hanoi, which was the house specialty vermicelli. Charbroiled beef, pork patties, and shrimp with fish sauce vinaigrette and greens. Great mix of flavors.  Overall a really great food experience.  Service was great as well.  I'd come back if I visit the Phoenix Scottsdale area.
