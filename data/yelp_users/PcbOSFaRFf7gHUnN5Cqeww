Cheba Hut has my favorite sandwiches in the Valley. Everything here is made with care - the employees never skimp on ingredients or mess up an order. The tables are always clean, the employees are pleasant, and everything from the hilarious decor to the food itself seems to have a friendly aura. They even have Mountain Dew, which thrills my green-blooded boyfriend. :-) My go-to sandwiches are the Griefo (toasted vegetarian with cream cheese) and the Panama Red (chicken Parmesan). The garlic sandwich bread is to die for. I highly recommend this (heh heh) joint!

Let's just say that this whole review could be summed up with a GIF of me drooling and stuffing my face, but I'll go ahead and use my words!  Someone I used to work with told me about this place and brought me one of their epic cinnamon rolls. I owe her for life (thanks Julie!), because this place is amazing. Their cinnamon rolls are indeed epic and come plain, with raisins, or with walnuts, and they are fresh and gooey and iced and the size of my head. Their granola is awesome if you're like me and enjoy it chewy and full of nuts and seeds. Seriously, if left to my own devices, I can eat a whole bag in one sitting. I probably need an intervention.  I haven't tried anything else here yet, but I look forward to happily chewing my way through their fresh bread, cake slices, and deli sandwiches made with Boar's Head meats and cheeses--my favorite. I could eat here every day if I lived in Gilbert, and it's probably good that I don't, because no one else would get any of their food.

So I hate writing negative reviews, but I feel the need to offer a few suggestions for improvement, since I've been to this FedEx Kinko's many times over the last several years.   I'd like to mention straight out that the employees have almost always been nice to me. This is great, of course, and it's one of the main reasons I've returned to this location so often. However, since I don't own a printer, I often send small print jobs via email, and I'm clear in my directions regarding choice of color, paper, and number of copies. About 50% of the time, my directions weren't followed. It's never wound up costing me much money, though, so I haven't complained. (For example, today I picked something up that should've been printed in black and white on regular paper, and I arrived to find it printed in color on heavier paper.)  Also, I feel that service has almost always been extremely slow. I will sometimes send in a one- or two-page document the day before I need it, and when I arrive the following day, I sometimes have to wait more than half an hour to receive the prints, even if no one is in line, or there are enough employees present to engage with several customers.   Both the delays and the wrong printings have caused me to be late or unprepared for appointments or otherwise compromised on several occasions. I would like to see employees focus on faster service while also improving accuracy. I am likely to keep returning to this location due to its proximity to my home, and if their practices improve, I'll be the first to write a positive review.

This is easily the best car wash in Tempe. I'm an Uber driver, so I've been to quite a few! I give them the first three stars for meeting expectations. I wanted a clean car, and they gave me a clean car plus one of those vent clip air fresheners, which are my favorite kind. Yay! The fourth star comes from their attention to detail. Even as I was conveyed through the automatic car wash, the employees followed my car and very carefully wiped it as it was washed and dried. Since I have a hatchback, I almost always exit car washes with drips running down my rear window, but these folks got it clean. Also, they recycle their water, which is a huge plus in this desert. The fifth star comes from a few things. Employees made friendly conversation and didn't try to upsell me at all. I also saw the owner himself working there today in this awful heat, which he didn't have to do, but he did it anyway. And third, I've seen so many positive reviews here from people saying they showed up right at closing time and still got a superior car wash, which I can totally see happening even though I have yet to experience it myself (I'm usually a Saturday afternoon person). So thanks, good people of the Wash Wizard, for a great overall customer experience every single time!!

Okay, so I'm not typically the person who writes the bad review . . . but I've gotta say that I really wish I'd just had a bowl of cereal and called it a night.  Boyfriend and I were exhausted from a rough day/week and pretty hungry. We ordered from 414 because they'd left a flier on our door. They had a special: an 18" pizza with one topping and garlic knots for $13.99. Not bad. We were told it would arrive in 35-45 minutes--also decent for a Thursday night 3 miles away.  An hour later I called back to ask what happened. Apparently they were pretty backed up, and they'd be sending an extra pizza along free of charge because of the wait. Okay, I figured, everyone gets backed up sometimes--not a big deal.  But I guess "a little backed up" means "Don't expect your pizza to show up for almost 2 hours." And of course I was willing to forgive that, but then I opened the boxes. The pizzas were mangled, totally squished, as though someone had held the boxes under an arm on their way up to our door. (I'll post a photo.)  Of course everything was cold--goes without saying. Hot, it would've been a decent pizza. The garlic knots were doughy and the dipping sauce tasted canned.  And to add insult to injury, they'd charged us for two toppings instead of one because I asked for half mushrooms, half olives (which makes one whole pizza, so one topping, in my opinion--debatable). So I got overcharged.  I'll be calling the manager tomorrow. At least the delivery kid was nice. And the only thing that could make this experience worse is if we wake up with food poisoning in the morning (pray for us).
