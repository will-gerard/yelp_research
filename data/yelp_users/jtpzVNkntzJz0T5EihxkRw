From the outside this looks like an average sandwich shop, but when you enter it's an adorable little cafe. They are making delicious sandwiches, amazing looking salads, espresso drinks, and have some great baked goods, as well.   We got cappuccinos - which were okay, but honestly, we were just excited they had espresso!!  For lunch I tried the reuben and I am glad I did. It was delicious. The meat was tender and juicy. It was very good. I just wish the sauerkraut had been a little stronger - but that's not a deal breaker.   My friend had the roast beef. The meat was a tad on the dry side (the reason I gave the place 4 starts instead of 5), but tasted pretty good. It had a unique southwestern spin.   Don't pass up trying this place.

I try to go to Lux as often as possible but I still have mixed feelings about it.   The cappuccino is wonderful; one of my favorites! I can't say that enough! I recommend making a trip to try one if you haven't! The food is always tasty and unique. If you can find a good place to sit I would try ordering one of the items on their menu, really fantastic! All of the pastries I have tried have been delicious also! I am telling you, you need to go!  The only reason Lux gets a 4 instead of 5 is because of the atmosphere. When I go its hit or miss, most of the time I get the impression they are way too hipster - bordering pretentious - to care about your experience. The following are just a couple examples:  I wanted to try a drink at their full bar one night, so I asked one of the employee's behind the bar what he had in his hand and he responded with "ice". Yes, there was a piece of ice held in a pair of tongs in one hand, but he also had a cocktail in the other hand... Following his response, he walked away from me and never returned to ask if I had any interest in ordering a drink or to give me any clue about what he'd been making. Most restaurants and employee's attempt to make you feel involved and entice you to purchase something, but no such luck. Unfortunately that experience was followed by another unpleasant one at the bar on a different night, so I haven't felt inclined to drink there again.   I had another recent experience with lux when I ordered a quiche from the front. We waited 10 minutes for them to heat it up but it was never called. So we checked and they said "oh, it must still be in the oven".. Although, didn't bother checking on the item or why this was taking so long to heat (since its already cooked). After another 10 minutes we checked with the front again and she finally went to check and said, "Oh, I guess its been in the oven the whole time". Needless to say it was overdone. The staff didn't apologize or offer a replacement, sadly this didn't impress my friend who hadn't been to Lux.  I still say you should go, the food and espresso are amazing. I just wish they would come back down to earth a little bit.

I love Delux! It's open late 7 days a week, which is a huge plus in Phoenix! I've never had a bad burger, all have been delicious; including the turkey burger, it's is very juicy and flavorful! I can't forget to mention the Chinese chicken salad, large portion and yummy! The addition of zen 32 sushi is nice light option to have at a burger joint. Some of the sushi items are a little overpriced, but has always been fresh!   Basically, You can't go wrong when you stop here; night or day!

The ambiance is nice, can be somewhat romantic at night with dim candles lighting up the patio. The waiter we had was very pleasant and just the right amount of checking up on us. The food was fair, but a bit overpriced for smaller portions and selection is limited. Overall I think it's a cute little restaurant with what appears to some pretty healthy and tasty options

This is a little gem located in an average strip mall.   I am not going to lie, when I first walked in I wasn't expecting much - possibly because there was blue hair and walkers in every direction, but we decided to give it a change because of the ratings on yelp.  The ambiance is okay... Although, its pretty small and can get stuffy! We had the unlucky chance of sitting next to the door and we kept having to scoot towards the wall or move the table so people could squeeze by. That aside, the food was surprisingly good.   They have a small drink menu and we wanted to try some of the unique beers; we ordered effes and almaza - mmm both were pretty tasty!   For the appetizer we went with the hummus. Unfortunately, this was the worst part of the meal. It was dry and tasted like it came from a package. I became a little worried about the entree, but we forged on.   We decided to try the shish kebab combo - DELICIOUS! My friend and I were surprised the ground beef kebab ended up being one of the best things we ate. It has a nice texture and was seasoned very well.The steak kebab was cooked perfectly! The chicken was good, maybe a little dry, but the side sauces helped with that.   I wouldn't recommend the hummus, but otherwise this place is serving up some delicious food.

I swear, I hear about this place all the time and I'm not sure why.    The ambiance is that of an old dive bar, which I don't mind, but nothing special. I felt the service was pretty good, although people were slightly confused by who's tab is who's.   The drinks were good and the selection of draft beers was small, but they have some good choices.  Oh my, now the food.... It was not impressive. My chicken tasted like it had been cooked while still frozen, it almost has no flavor and an undesirable texture that made it impossible for me to eat. I also tried the scallops and they were yummy, but I think scallops usually are, unless you over or under cook them.   Overall not super impressed. Also, let me just add that walking through the kitchen to the bathroom is just not appetizing to me...probably won't be back.

The ambiance is relaxing, yet refined.   The service is always good. The steak was good, although not cooked to the correct temperature which is surprising for a steakhouse. I would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order. I typically order medium, but at donovan's would get medium rare. The side dish menu was somewhat limited, but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus, both were good. Of course, you have to try the creme brulee - Yum!

I was surprised with some chocolates from Julia Baker's recently and when I received them I was excited (who wouldn't be it was a surprise and it's chocolates... Win win), but I honestly hadn't heard of JB confections.... Boy,  was I happy to have tried these! They were fantastic! I got a variety and all were so wonderful! I can't wait to do a chocolate tasting sometime soon!

First, I have to say I don't tend to write a review unless I like the place, but this place was just bad. It is waaaaay overpriced, even for sushi! The service was not so great, the waitresses seemed way too cool to be taking care of us. The sushi I would say was good, but not great. I had one roll the was really good, the rest were middle of the road. I would not recommend.

I have been to every Mastro's in Az and I have been happy with all of them, but this one is by far my favorite. I don't know if its the atmosphere or the nostalgia because I remember it was drinkwater's city hall, but something about it just makes the steak taste better.   The service is always great and the staff is friendly. I always have the filet, its always tender and juicy. It isn't my favorite steak in the valley, but definitely delicious. The lobster mashed potatoes are amazing, I would eat them everyday if I could! The crab gnocchi is good, but can't compare to the lobster mashed potatoes. The brussel sprouts are yummy and crispy.   Nothing really to complain about, they provide the best overall experience of a steakhouse in Phoenix.

This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to in Phoenix! We got samosas to start; for entrees we had chicken tikka tandoori, chicken korma, lamb kofta curry, and plain naan. Everything was pretty delicious! The chicken korma was better than I think I've ever had and I really enjoyed the chicken tikka tandoori! The naan was wonderful also! The samosa wasn't the best one I've had, but it was still good and big portions! We also had one of the specialty cocktails with mango lassi, yum! Lastly, the staff was friendly and quick! I would highly recommend!

This is one of the best steakhouses in the west valley!   The atmosphere isn't as upscale as some other steakhouses - definitely casual, but it's a little warmer and friendlier than some I've been to.  The complimentary breads always come out warm and fresh. I get the filet when I come; it's tender, has a good flavor, and not too salty! I don't recommend getting oscar style here, it wasn't much crab and it didn't add a lot to the steak. (If you want oscar style then ocean club does it better -IMHO). The sides are middle of the road, nothing special, but the prices are much cheaper than your typical steakhouse, so I think it's fair! Although, I generally skip the sides when I go to arrowhead and get a salad instead.   Arrowhead also offers a nice happy hour and bar menu. The bar staff is always very friendly and a lot of fun to spend your happy hour with! They have very tasty filet sliders and crab cake sliders... Mmmmmm! Plus, I do love their moscow mules and pear Martinis!  Overall, I would recommend

I adore this place. It's cute and quaint, but trendy. The mahi mahi tacos are refreshing and light, some of the yummiest in Phoenix for sure. The skirt steak tacos were extremely tender and flavorful. The only dish I've tried that I didn't enjoy were the chicken tacos, but probably because everything else had so much more flavor. I also love all the drink options, there is a great deal of unique liquors and specialty cocktails to try!   This place is delicious and unique! Will definitely be back!

I'll start with the experience with the hostess; she seemed very confused and unclear of why we were there.   The waiter was nice enough, but the service was not up to what I would expect at a steakhouse.   The filet was subpar; very salty, but edible. The sides were nothing exceptional.   At the end of our meal we were having some cocktails but the wait staff seemed frustrated that we weren't rushing to leave, even though they were open for another 45-50 minutes.   I wouldn't make a trip back.

This is a review I wish was going to be different, but here goes... I've been looking forward to going here for quite a while, but was less than what I had hoped.   Let's start with the ambiance, which is great. It feels very cozy and warm; you feel like you're at a friends house just hanging out.   Next the service; our waitress was nice, but she seemed to hover by the bar and rarely made it to our table to check on us.   Now the food and drink...  The beer selection was limited and the wine selection quite pricey for this small restaurant, but it's easy to find something you will enjoy. I tried the oatmeal stout, yum!  We started with the potato and parsnip poutine; the cheese was greasy and flavorless, the potatoes and parsnips were not crispy, and the mushroom gravy was severely lacking salt.   Next, we had the fried chicken and waffles. The portion was generous, but the waffles were soggy (which I assume was due to the addition of cheese or maybe too much egg?) and honestly they could have used more flavor, a bit on the bland side. Although, the chicken was very crispy and crunchy, it had little flavor. I had to ask for hot sauce to start enjoying my meal. Oddly enough, my favorite part of the meal was the side of crispy green beans, they were delish!   I really wanted this place to be great, but was sadly disappointed! :(  I might go back to see if some of the other food is better or if it's just a bunch of hipster hype.

Love the atmosphere! Cute little patio with small amount of surrounding greenery... Almost feels like you're out of Az a minute. The bar is nice and open, despite the fairly small location. And when there is live music it's easily heard. It gives you a very intimate feel.   Wine and beer is always nice, not much to review there. The bruschetta is wonderful and the sandwiches are tasty! I wish the menu had a few more options, but can't complain about a place doing only a few items well. Overall I dig this place!

I recently went back for the "happy hour" - 20 dollars for a bottle and bruschetta.   It's a great deal and as always the bruschetta was delicious! It's packed, I recommend getting there early and having a glass before 8

I have been to over easy many times, it's a cute little place that has some good untraditional options. I think the low carb steak and eggs is delicious; chicken fried steak was pretty good, but not the best; and I was surprised that I really enjoyed the loco moco!! It also made me happy that they have espresso, mmmm! The cappuccino is ok but their lattes are pretty good.

I like this little place! I think I enjoy its friendly staff the most!   The food is good, limited on the non pork options, but I think I am in the minority of people who don't care for pork.   I was very pleased with the corned beef hash!. It is very hard to find homemade corned beef hash so I was delighted when I got my plate and could easily tell it wasn't from a can and tasted good.   The cappuccinos are good, most of the time, but I think some of the staff isn't sure how to use the machine.   Overall, it's a nice breakfast place.

I tried this restaurant based on a friends recommendation.... Sad to say, I was disappointed. The service was terrible. Very slow and not attentive. The food was not terrible, but not anything special. The pancakes were pretty decent, but not good enough to come back for after my experience with service.

I've been here multiple times because of the unique menu... It's always nice when you can have something different.  Each time I get the angry shrimp button mushrooms and I'm always amazed at how tasty they are! Some of the other yummy mushrooms are the florentine and cheeseburger stuffed mushrooms!   I've had the chicken Marsala which was very good and I love the Tuscan veggies on the side.   It is a little pricy for small portions, so I recommend going during happy hour. I would say at least try it, you won't regret it!

I have made the trek to curry corner a few times from Glendale because it's worth the drive! I love the food, the best Indo-Pak restaurant in phx! I have never been disappointed by this place. I have tried multiple dishes and I'll try to keep it brief!   The chicken tikka fries were delicious and something new, worth trying! The samosas taste freshly prepared with what seems like homemade pastry. By far one of the best chicken tikka masalas I've ever had, a must try!!!!! I've also tried the lamb karahi which was delicious, the lamb was not tough, but this dish does take extra time so don't order if you're in a hurry! The afghani boti had so much delicious spicy flavor with lots of cilantro, the meat was so tender and juicy! The malai kofta was delicious not as heavy as I'm used to with a little more spice than normal, which was a nice change. The aloo mataar was a great vegetarian dish high on flavor! Of all the dishes I've tried there was only one I wouldn't order again, the nehari noor jehan. The meat was too fatty and there wasn't much; I think I had 4-5 pieces. Overall, I love this place and wish I lived closer to it!

All I can say is wow! This was a special experience. You walk into this small, tranquil little place in Scottsdale with a quiet sushi chef making amazing bites of food. We did the 5 course option, which was plenty of food! We both felt full after dinner. Each course was so delicately prepared with obvious thought behind the combinations. Our waitress was lovely; she explained each dish in detail and instructed us on the recommended way to enjoy each piece. The entire meal was a delight and really felt like a magical experience.

I love steakhouses and I was excited to try dominick's, but I was very disappointed.  First, the service was terrible. They were busy, but not  any busier than I would expect a steakhouse on a Friday evening. We were definitely forgotten about. We had the lobster cocktail, was okay. Next, we tried the chopped salad. It was your average house salad. We both got Filet's, which were the most disappointing. The meat had a bad flavor. I have never sent an item back at a steakhouse, but we both sent back the filet's. I ended up ordering the sea bass instead, which was better than the steak, but not the best I've had. My friend's appetite was ruined though and chose not to order anything else. I would not go back, especially when you have Mastro's Ocean Club across the street, which is delicious.

Well, I've been looking forward to trying this place for a while... But the excitement was short lived.  The grocery store area is very charming. The service wasn't bad, but not personable or memorable.   We got the platter with chicken, pulled pork, and brisket with macaroni and cheese and baked beans for the sides. We also tried the crab cake salad.   The iced tea was really tasty! They have multiple sauces so we found 2 we thought were good.  First of all, the meat platter was really small for 16 dollars. The brisket was so dry it looked beyond dead and it was chewy like it was recooked from the day before. The pork was also very dry and pretty flavorless. The chicken was surprisingly pretty decent although nothing to write home about. The crab cakes were okay, but mostly tasted like fried breadcrumbs. Salad was just a bed of spring mix with tomatoes and nothing much else to speak of.  As for the sides.... The macaroni had a good flavor but had completely separated and all the grease was laying on top.. Pretty much seemed to be microwaved from another day.  The beans were lackluster just like everything else, but also really provided no texture.   Overall, it was a cute place with good iced tea, but my advice is try little miss BBQ instead.

I've been here many times and the food it always great, with exception of the buffet but that's my own personal issue; I hate buffets.   I always start with samosas and pani poori! I looooove pani poori I'm so happy they have this dish and the chutney with is is awesome! The samosas are huge here and veeeeery crispy filled with lots of deliciousness! (I also recommend the samosa chaat and bhel poori - the flavored are all blended together for you).  As far as entrees- I've had the chicken tikka masala, all I can say is yum! The malai kofta here is the best I've ever had, but it's pretty rich and very difficult to finish! The lamb kurma is tender and always has great flavor. Chicken saag was pretty good but not as much flavor as many of the other dishes. If you have friends that want more of a Chinese dish try the manchurian dishes; I've had chicken and gobi (cauliflower) both are good. Oh and I can't forget the dosai. Dosai is hard to find and it's always wonderful here!  The food does run a little spicy, even if you enjoy the spicier dishes like me, but can ask for light spice.   The only reason they got a 4 is because service can be less than good. Hopefully it will improve.

I've been to the salty sow a few times, even though I'm not a pork-eater...most of my friends are obsessed with it, so the first time I wasn't expecting much, but I'm so happy I went!  The atmosphere is nice - warm and inviting! The staff is prompt, polite, and well trained.   We were there to catch the end of happy hour, which has some great choices for a good price! The signature cocktails are yummy - I suggest trying something new.   For dinner - We tried the honey rosemary chicken, aaaaaaamazing!! The beef shoulder taco wasn't bad, but after the chicken it couldn't compete. I also had the brussel sprouts and deviled eggs, both were very good. We also tried the duck fat fries which were just okay in my (humble) opinion.  Highly recommend.

The atmosphere is cute and trendy. The staff was helpful seemed happy to be there. The patio is a little small and can feel as if you're encroaching on others space and conversations.   The sushi was good, but overpriced for what you get. The chicken lollipop was tasty. I also tried the nori prime ribeye, which had a pretty good flavor, although, I kept searching for the kimchi and veggies in the dish, but to no avail. They were much needed to break up the creme fraiche, which really had no business being in this dish.   Overall pretty good, the sushi was yummy. I would go back, but probably not order anymore of the entree dishes.

I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars, but alas that isn't possible, but I don't think it only deserves 3. It's your basic Little breakfast diner that is serving decent diner food. Don't come here for a gourmet breakfast, but it is good. We waited for 40 minutes for a seat, so I assumed the food was going to be amazing. I got the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good, but required hot sauce for some needed flavor. It seemed like it was freshly made not a pre made frozen brick. I think I will try it again and get something new, maybe I'll like it even more.

First, you have to start with the wonderful atmosphere. Its in an old church in central Phoenix and has a warm and charming environment.   The menu is small, but of course most people are going to order the tacos.   We had the guacamole for a starter, can't complain! I love guac and it was yummy! For dinner, I tried the yucatan shrimp, chipotle cherry steak, and urban bean coffee braised beef tacos. My favorite was the chipotle cherry steak - it was a unique flavor combination, but completely worked! My friend had the enchiladas and was very happy with the dish. It was a decent sized portion with a great flavor.  I also tried one of the margaritas, it was pretty strong, but still tasted yummy! Definite win!  I would  go back.

I was so excited to try some delicious burgers at hopdoddy and the food didn't disappoint.   With that in mind, when we arrived every customer seemed confused by what to do (not sure why, but it was quite odd). After you've placed your order, you grab your own stuff and then sit down at your pre-assigned seat, when all of the sudden a waiter/waitress appears... please tell me why couldn't we just sit down and have a waitress from the beginning then?? Plus, if most of your staff is standing around you probably aren't utilizing them and if you need to have 2 of them to stand by the door to instruct your customers on what to do, maybe its not a good plan... but I digress.   I tried the the primetime burger, was pretty good, but would get something different next time. My friend tried the El Diablo burger and was extremely happy with it; I tried a bite and it was delicious.   Overall, yummy burgers, house-made sauces, and pretty decent drinks.

I love the entire shopping center very cute and inviting and this place was no exception; adorable.   The espresso was pretty good, not the very best, but I would get again.   I tried the irish benny, but wish I had gotten something else. Most of the components on the benny were pretty good, but the corned beef hash tasted like it was your typical canned variety. So next time I would get something else altogether or just a different type of benedict; luckily they have a large variety!!! My friend had chicken fried steak and was happy with his choice. He said it tasted freshly made.   I will definitely go back again

I went for lunch, which may have been a mistake because the menu seems limited, despite the menu listed here, but either way, we started with brisket nachos which looked promising and were edible, but each piece of brisket on the platter was probably 95% fat and 5% meat, seems like they could use some quality control.   For my entree I ordered the express lunch (your choice of 2 meats). I chose turkey and brisket, it came with coleslaw and tortillas. I don't know why I had tortillas with this, unless it's because we are in Arizona?! Again, I was disappointed by the brisket. It was not extremely tasty and very very very fatty, the turkey was pretty good but dry.   My friend got the pulled pork sandwich, but he ended up not eating much of it because it was smothered in too much dressing and bbq sauce.   I wouldn't really recommend based on this experience, but maybe I'll try it again for dinner one night.

I am so glad they opened this location so I don't have to drive so far away now.   Its a hip little place with a laid back vibe. The staff is polite, although not always attentive. I sometimes feel as if the entire staff is a bunch of college kids that need a little extra direction, but have been pretty pleased with my experiences there.   I have tried the cheese board and can't complain about it. The meats and cheeses were delish! I especially enjoyed brie stuffed croissant, mmmm! The blue crab dip was pretty good, nothing to write home about. I LOVE the Az Burger, it's become one of my favorite burger's in town! I wish you could actually choose the temperature of your burger, you only have an option of" pink or not pink", which I find absolutely ridiculous at what seems like a brewery and burger place.  I think they have a great selection of specialty beers and cocktails. No matter what I am in the mood for there is something yummy available to try.    I have not been let down by their food or drinks and would recommend.

I was looking for a new breakfast place to try yesterday and decided to go here after driving by.   The restaurant is fresh and clean appearing and very lively. We were greeted quickly and sat down immediately.   I ordered a cappuccino and mimosa, mmmmmm! The cappuccino was well done and the mimosa was mostly champagne with a splash of orange juice - AWESOME!  For breakfast I tried the skirt steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to medium (what I asked for) and was really good. My friend tried the corned beef hash and eggs with pancakes. The corned beef hash looked like the canned version, but you could tell by the taste it wasn't, had good flavor, but not my favorite texture. The pancakes were delicious, nice and fluffy and very sweet, almost like cake.   I will definitely be back and looking forward to trying one of the benedict's with another mimosa!

I am excited there is a real coffee place nearby that I can get a good cappuccino! The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. There is a gentleman there who clearly enjoys what he is doing and makes you excited to try their coffee. We tried the burritos once, they were a little on the small side, but had nice flavor. I definitely recommend stopping by for a cup of your favorite drink!
