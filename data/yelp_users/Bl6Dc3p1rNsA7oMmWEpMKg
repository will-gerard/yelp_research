If I could give them 0 stars I would. Called for an oil change from the parking lot and was told there was no wait, when I walked in literally less than a minute later they told me there was a 2 hour wait. Jeremy was ride and had no interest in helping me. They DIDN'T rotate like my tires like they were supposed to and were shady about it when I asked them about it. Instead of the price they had listed there were arbitrary fees that made it almost $10 more. Their employees were grimy, shady and not at all courteous or pleasant. I will not be back and will be calling their corp office. What a horrible experience.

Spoke with Robert and not only was he rude he was unhelpful.  Terrible hours and worse customer service. Skip this place.

I gave this company 2 tries. Never again. Each interaction was with a girl who had obvious problems with the English language. They are rude and unprofessional and ghetto. They laugh when I explain my complaint from another rep I talked to. I would rather not waste my time with this employee and their trashy employees.  No phone etiquette or manners.

Came here for a brow wax and the woman messed them up terribly. Didn't ask how I wanted them and turns out she isn't licensed!! I'll be contacting state board asap.

Save your time. This place is ghetto. The employees are rude and barely speak English. They're too lazy to look something up and refer you back to the people that transferred you there. What a waste of space. If you want to deal with just above functionally illiterate employees with no service skills you found your place! Poor service. Poor people skills.

Was on this side of town and I needed a cut. The barber (Mike) did an awesome job. Asked for clarification if anything was vague. Awesome price. I would come here again if I'm on the west side.

Horrible, rude staff. Asked to get a brow wax and played the "we will be with you in a min" game and everyone was obviously busy and not close to done. I asked for a better time estimate than "a few min" and had an attitude. I walked out. Horrible, horrible, rude service.

I didn't even get a cut here... Walked in, after about 10 min of getting ignored we get up to leave. A barber asks if we were coming back and I say no. He gets aggressive asking why and I explain we were ignored. He starts yelling at me so I got in my car and left. Unsafe environment and bad service.

This place is great. Really good food and very friendly staff. I didn't get any weird looks or bad service because I don't speak Spanish. The Torta Paquine hot was amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and not dry at all. I'll definitely go to the one closer to my house.

Came in stood at counter for about 5 minutes while employees told me "hang on" and stood by drive thru window.  Not worth the time.

Rude service people. Overpriced food. Was a waste of my time and money. They took forever and had no organization with their orders.

This store is a joke. A lobby full of annoyed customers (myself included) and none of the employees seem particularly concerned with any sense of urgency.   The people working were slow moving and not very friendly. I would go out of my way to not have to come here again.

I stopped in this place one night randomly and fell in love. The people are nice. The food is made when it's ordered and you can even see them make it. Always spotless inside.   The food is amazing. Full of flavor and always fresh. This place is by far one of my favorite Chinese restaurants!

Just tried this shop out today and it was awesome. Very laid back but good work done.  The shop was clean and had a great atmosphere. All three barbers did a good job on their clients (including mine). I will definitely come back here.
