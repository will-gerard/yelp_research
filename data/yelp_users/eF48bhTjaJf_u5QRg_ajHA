I would not recommend Not the Honey Bears I remember, counter service sucks. No more bar. If you like eating off a piece of aluminum foil this place is great, if you want a plate and utensils its $1.75 per person more. Beer was cheap and cold at 2.75 for a bud lite. Sides were nice and hot but the brisket was cold and the bun was as cheap as you can get. The corn on the Cobb was hot but old. Beans were good, as was the Mac and cheese. The brisket was not tasty at all bbq sauce was runny and tasteless over all I would not recommend coming to honey bears $30 bucks for two brisket sandwich with two sides and two beers.

Started off with the Beer Flight, which is a good value at $6.25, my fianc√© had a margarita that had no alcohol in it, so that received a ZERO VALUE for the $10.50 asking price.  She ordered a chopped salad and I ordered a Kobe beef hamburger. Both meals were very good, although the fries were served cold (well slightly warm but not hot) Our server was very good personable, helpful and attentive. I ordered a 20oz beer about halfway into the meal and it was about 2 oz under poured.  This is a personal pet peeve. Some will say "its suppose to have that much head" more than a half an inch for me is too much but that's just me.  Over all not a bad meal but not worth the $68 total price (including tip) So here is the breakdown  Ice tea - Ok Margarita - Crap Flight - good Chopped Salad - Good Kobe Burger - Good  Fries - Cold 20 oz beer - under poured  Happy hour prices were not honored on the patio.   Over all.... Meh. We probably will not go back.

This place is awesome, kind of dark and subdued but totally works, once inside the staff is super helpful and friendly. If you like beer, well they have 20+ handles on tap. The food? The food you ask? AWESOME Cornish Patsy's of every flavor and type! Pork, chicken, beef, veggie, Mexican, Italian on and on and on.... Oh I'm not done, desert Patsy's !!! So FREAKING GOOD! You have to try this place! Great history of how Patsy's came to be, mining theme on the walls. Try it you'll love it!

This was my first experience with Thai food and wow was it awesome! Dennis our waiter suggested some great dishes, and his service was impeccable. Jude (my date) knew Thai food inside and out her and Dennis came up with the perfect choices.  The beer was good, the Thai tea was amazing....I could not have been more please.  We will definitely be back.

Okay, it's a Tuesday evening. So my expectations are low. Good thing. To save you a little time if you are reading this review, I won't be coming back to Wahoo's. The former Hitching Post was actually a pretty decent place....Here we go...first if you're looking for a cold beer this is not the place for you. The beer is served Luke warm, I had a Shiner Bock. With my beer I asked for a menu. The menu was filthy (see pictures). I told the bartender the menu looked like it had come from the parking lot and she just laughed. Sigh. The bartender and a male coworker proceeded to complain about a customer who had just cussed them out because of the credit card and tip system. Evidently the credit card machine is brought to the table and you have to enter the tip in front of the server (awkward). speaking of awkward. The staff is uncomfortably awkward. The bar/restaurant closes at 8:00 PM to emphasize this fact the bartender screams "LAST CALL" at 7:55 with 5 people in the restaurant, including me. Now to the food. The fries were hot, which I appreciate. The "Ghost burger" was SUPER DRY. The taste was adequate but the bun was like steel wool. Over all a major thumbs down for a $10 burger. Not sure what happened to this place but I won't be coming back.
