Went for dinner on a Tuesday at 7 pm (July 1). Their own website says they are open until 10 pm. Their voice message on their phone says the same. Drove 30 minutes to have a meal here. Later a friend pointed out their Facebook page says they are closed for the week (4th of July week). Ridiculous to update one place and leave others unchecked.  Waste of my time to try a new place.  Won't bother coming back if they can't communicate adequately.

After hearing amazing reviews during my 5 years living in Arizona, I finally decided to make the 30 minute drive to check out the hype.  I checked the website for menu and hours before making the trip. Someone had suggested to order ahead as the wait can be long, even on a weeknight, so while driving, I called ahead. No one answered but the voice message gave hours which suggested they may just be too busy to answer. Upon arrival, they were closed.  At 6 pm on a Tuesday evening. Their website and voice mail clearly stated 4 pm to 10 pm Tuesday-Saturday. There was another couple standing outside as well, in similar disbelief.  What a waste of a drive.  Luckily Federal Pizza was just a few miles up the road and they were not only open, but the staff was great and the pizza was outstanding. Very poor job of maintaining public communication.  Fail. I won't bother trying again.

Consistently the very best Italian food I've had anywhere... I am Italian. I've been to Italy. I love pizza and pasta.  To say this is my favorite Italian restaurant in the world compares it to those I've visited in Naples, Rome, Venice, Florence and Pisa. It is a true testament to the quality of their food. Not to mention, the service is great too! If you haven't been, I recommend it with my highest confidence.  And if you have been there, I know you agree.

Worst service ever.  Last year I had my car parked and it was vandalized while valeted. Now I've sat in line for 20 minutes, was told to go around the corner to another stand, that stand said to go down the alley, went down alley and told they are full and I would have to go back to the beginning to wait in line or park myself. It was a clusterfuck shitstorm. They were rude, passed the blame amongst one another and ultimately I had to park my own car.  Parking my car wasn't an issue.  Being lied to and misled was an issue.  If they'd have been honest about the full lot from the start, this wouldn't even be a post.  It has taken less time to write than the time to get service. One of the worst service experiences I've had, considering not a single person of the 7 I spoke with took any ownership.

PAID CASH but STILL charged CREDIT.  WILL NOT REFUND.  Ordered by phone, gave credit card info. Pizza was delivered to hotel room, but driver insisted card was not billed and he needed cash.  Total was $52.17, gave $60 cash. The next day, $52.17 was still billed to credit card.    After repeated attempts to get a refund, calling the business daily, no refund was issued.  In 30 days of promises, I never got a single call back.  I finally had direct contact with the owner after 30 days. He informed me delivery driver had quit and kept the cash, but that as a business owner, he had to make his money somehow.  I pointed out that in order for him to make his $52.17, I was then paying $112.17 for my pizza. He said he can't control what the driver did, though as the business owner who hired the driver, he is responsible for the drivers theft.  No matter what, the customer should not pay twice.    The owner had NO signed receipt but still refused to refund the money to the card.  He agreed I paid cash, agreed that he had not returned my phone calls, even agreed that I was told I would not be charged on my card.  This business owner simply seeks profits and will not accept any responsibility for his poor hiring choices.    I do not suggest giving them your credit card information - though I am sure the owner would really prefer sticking to cash sales anyway given his interest in profits.

Absolutely horrible.  Went to the first location at Tatum and Cave Creek.  Told her I needed spray tan.  She let me fill out paperwork while she chatted away on her phone and then told me the one sprayer they had was down. Not sure why she didn't tell me at first.  Then sent me to the location a mile away. Got to the next location and my information wasn't entered correctly from the first so she had to find someone else to fix it.  Then after paying, and 30 minutes of trying, found their sprayer was broken too. They told me I'd have to wait 2-3 days and then call back to speak with a manager about getting a refund for the services I never received. You take an hour of my life and my money and won't even refund it when you can't provide the service? Horrible. Bunch of kids running the place with a manager who has no idea what customer service is about.

Posted 10 months ago about a bad experience. Had someone follow up within 2 weeks. Gave me a number of a person to contact who would offer free services to make up for the situation. I've now called 10 times in 10 months and left 10 messages asking for a return call. Have yet to hear back and while I appreciated the original contact, 10 messages later should have gotten a response.

I hired Jacked Ice as bartenders for my New Year's Eve party. They were on time, professional, prepared and ensured all of my guests' beverage needs were handled.  They went above and beyond by suggesting new and fun drinks for guests. I highly recommend them for everything from weddings to kids parties, Christmas galas to birthdays and reunions - they are sure to be able to handle it all and at a reasonable price.

Have had them host a couple events now. On time,  professional, fair price. Great, unique concept that mixes well with traditional beverage service. Have attended events they've serviced both large and small, formal and casual. Seems like they have the talent and resources to do the full range of events imaginable.  Small misunderstanding from previous review was resolved quickly.

Have been a client for over 8 years. That should pretty much speak for itself since I haven't had the same job, car, house or relationship that's last that long! Definitely a professional with a fun, happy attitude and attention to detail. Best scalp massage ever!
