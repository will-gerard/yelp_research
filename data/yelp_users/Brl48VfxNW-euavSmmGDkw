Ok, we live in San Diego, which has a pretty good zoo in its own right, plus an equally awesome Safari Park. But we were in greater Phoenix over the holidays and had never been to the Phoenix Zoo. It is definitely smaller than San Diego's but overall it is a great facility and our whole family enjoyed the visit.  My favorite animals were the huge African lions - seriously those kitties looked as big as Budweiser Clydesdales. Huge.   What we didn't love about the Zoo was the nickel and diming.  We bought the more expensive premium ticket, which did get us on to the carousel and safari train, but everything else was extra. Can we get close to the giraffes?  Nope - that's extra. What about that fun-looking 5-second polar inner tube ride?  Nope - that's additional too. If they are going to sell a premium ticket, they should be more clear about what is and isn't included.   The zoo also flubbed the family photo taken as we entered the park. We inputted our code after we returned home. $16 for a 5"x7"?  Shouldn't they want to encourage folks to bring home a nice family memento of a great day at the Phoenix Zoo, to be displayed for friends and family to see and consider a visit of their own?  At least we could send the photo to friends and family, right?  After all, a nice low res photo for use on social media would have been a great inexpensive advertising and marketing opportunity for the Zoo. But when we hit the link to post the photo it had PROOF written all over it. No thanks. Swing and a miss.   Our experience was mostly great. Sure, the narration on the safari train was too soft to be heard over the chatty passengers, which was annoying, but the zoo was awesome, despite the a la carte pricing.

Pane Bianco somehow got even cuter.  Since the last time we were here, they added a cool full service eat-in dining room where the cafe next door used to be.   On this visit I had the Market Sandwich which this time was an Egg Fritata with spicy sopresota, manchego, tomato, greens and onion.  I actually thought the locally grown tomatoes were the star - much beefier and tastier than the grocery store tomatoes we get at home. I wanted more sopresota, but I got my fix with a piece of my sister-in-law's sopresota sandwich with aged provolone and wood-roasted onions. This is my favorite sandwich on the menu, which I ordered myself the last time we were at Pane Bianco. According to our server, the most popular sandwich is the mozzarella, followed by the sopresota.  I'd put all of these sandwiches up against any of the best sandwiches served anywhere.  Our kiddos loved the focaccia as well.   They bake the awesome round bread in the wood-burning hearth you see when you walk in, they make and smoke the mozzarella on the premises and the veggies are locally sourced as well. Great place.  #amazingsandwiches

Tastiest food of our week in greater Phoenix.  We ordered the Indian Taco, the Red Chili Indian Taco and the UFO kids meal, with fun shaped little frybread pieces and beans and cheese.  The food was really simple and exceedingly delicious.   The vibe in the place was cool too.  Lots of local folks were there - people who know from good.  While it didn't look like much from the outside, The Fry Bread House was clean and the staff was really friendly. Open since 1992, we're already hooked after one visit.  We had a nice time, we loved the fry bread tacos, and we can't wait to go back during our next trip to Phoenix.  Highly recommend.

My wife and I visit Greater Phoenix a couple times a year.  Our fave restaurant is Pizzeria Bianco.  I have a story to illustrate how good the place is.  This is not a joke - this actually happened on our first visit.  As we were advised to do, we arrived several hours before they opened.  This was back when they had more limited hours and they weren't open for lunch.  We waited in the line, but it wasn't too hot out, and we had a nice time.  When we finally sat down, we were hungry.  But before we could order, a very normal looking middle-aged woman entered the restaurant and approached our table.  She said her son was visiting from out of state and they had to take him to the airport, and they didn't have time to stand in the line, but her son's favorite thing in the world is the Sonny Boy pizza from Pizzeria Bianco, so would we mind ordering a couple extra pizzas to go when we ordered our meal?  Apparently Pizzeria Bianco doesn't accept takeout orders, but they will give you a pizza or two to-go if you order them as part of your meal.  Before we could say no, the woman was already thanking us and I had $40 in my hand.  We were stunned.  When our server approached us, he asked if we knew that woman.  We said no, and we told him the truth when he asked what she wanted.  He told us he'd take care of the situation, and he went outside to chat with the woman.  Then she stormed back into the restaurant, told us we threw her under the bus, demanded her money back and marched back out of the restaurant.  Pizzeria Bianco is that good.  We started with the Antipasto with the awesome roasted veggies, I think we had the Caprese salad and we had 2 of the pizzas - the Sonny Boy and I think the Wiseguy.  Fantastic meal.  Pizzeria Bianco is that good.

As Vegas steakhouses go, Delmonico is a fine choice. I've been there twice and both times I've had very good meals. With that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit I'm afraid Delmonico should have been even better. This year we had a large company dinner at Delmonico, so I was able to try lots of dishes.   We started with the BBQ shrimp and the butternut squash ravioli. The shrimp was good but a little overcooked. The squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. I loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  I also tried the truffle potato chips, which were wonderful but extremely truffley.   The lobster bisque was textbook, exactly what lobster bisque is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. Still I might have preferred my neighbor's heirloom tomato salad, which I tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  I didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues.   For my entr√©e I had the Delmonico signature steak - a bone-in ribeye. This is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. The steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. My order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and I thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. Don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks I've had in Las Vegas, at all price points. One of my close work friends who has frequented Delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. Of the sides I loved the creamed corn. Next time I'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which I found undercooked and under seasoned. The asparagus was also fine but unspectacular.   The bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but I'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. Best bite of the night. One of the best I've had. Wonderful.

My wife and I know breafast fare, and we think Bouchon is the best anywhere, bar none.  Yesterday morning was our second visit to Bouchon - the first was a couple years ago.  The setting feels elegant and calm, in stark contrast to manic hustle of the Las Vegas Strip.  My wife ordered the Quiche du Jour, which yesterday was a quiche florentine (spinach and cheese), served with a simple salad of lightly dressed greens.  I had the Croque Madame (toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce) which was served with more french fries than I deserved.  Seriously, Chef, you can pull back on the volume of fries.  But everything, from the complimentary bread served with butter and incredible jam, to the perfect quiche to the wonderful croque, was FANTASTIC.  Highly recommend.  Only criticism was they were a bit snooty when my wife and I tried to swing by for lunch the day before - seems strange that they say they are open for lunch but close at 1 pm.  Regardless, we can't wait to come back.

The Bouchon Bakery kiosk is one of the reasons I like to stay at The Venetian, and it is also why I prefer the old tower.  Located at the base of the elevators, everything I've had from Bouchon Bakery has been great.  Yesterday my wife and I picked up a pistachio macaron, a peanut butter and jelly macaron and a chocolate chip cookie.  All three were fantastic.  In the past couple years, on prior trips, I've also had their cinnamon rolls, sandwiches, cookies, treats - you name it.  If Bouchon Bakery sells it, it won't just be good - you can bet it will be great.  I'm giving Bouchon Bakery 4 stars rather than 5 stars because of the staff and because of the lack of seating.  The staff doesn't really display much of a sense of urgency, so the line doesn't move as quickly as it should, and there is nowhere nearby to sit down.  Still, fantastic place.  Highly recommend.

Our family had a fantastic time last week at the Children's Museum of Phoenix.  It was our second visit to the museum in as many years, and it confirmed my prior opinion that this is one of the best children's museums anywhere.    The challenge with this museum is that it gets very crowded and some of the interactive exhibits are optimized for the kids' enrichment and enjoyment rather than to facilitate the parents' supervision, which adds to the challenge of keeping a watchful eye on your little ones.  One the first level is "the Climber", where the kiddos walk, climb, crawl and explore several levels up in a complicated structure.  Museum staffers are well positioned to listen and watch for children who are upset or scared, but I had a difficult time tracking my kids' progress.  There are three places where the kids can exit, so a couple times my daughter left the structure and despite trying to track her I didn't know where she was.  Same with the Noodle Forest on the 3rd level - the kids enter the noodles and you can either try to follow or just cover the 60' +/- exit to make sure they don't get past.  Our kids loved everything - The Climber, Whoosh (the scarves zipping around the vacuum tubes), the floating ping pong balls with the PVC pipes next to Whoosh on the first floor, the car wash/pedal power on the 2nd floor, the Market and of course the Noodle Forest on the 3rd Floor.  Everything was great fun.  The physical plant also enhances the experience at the museum.  It is a great reuse of an historic school building.  I am a big believer that great spaces make an impression and a difference.  The building makes the museum even better.  Great experience.  Highly recommend.

Encore is now my favorite place to stay in Las Vegas.  My wife and I stayed here for the first time a couple years ago but on our last visit we moved down the strip to the new, supposedly hottest most cosmopolitan hotel in town. I'm happy to be back at Encore.  Encore has a great brand, and it is luxurious, bright and welcoming.  The location rocks too - proximity to the airport and Las Vegas Convention Center are also excellent.   The room is my favorite in town. It is really well designed and furnished, and every detail has been considered - even the thermostat is black against the black wall. Who thinks about buying a thermostat any color other than white?  The controls for the lights and the drapes are on the night table and the bed is really comfortable. My tv swiveled around to the living room area pushed only by my pinky finger. The shower is also a highlight - beautiful with perfect water pressure.   I also really like the size of the casino. I find even the adjacent Wynn to be too big, crowded and imposing. The scale of Encore is more intimate, and everything is more conveniently located closer together.  Sure, the food options in particular are limited, yet the additional restaurants, shopping and entertainment options afforded by the Wynn are a short and beautiful indoor walk away.  Even the the taxi lines seem quicker at Encore.   I also have to comment that Le Reve remains my favorite show of any sort that I've seen anytime, ever.    Did I mention how much I like the room?

This was at least the 2nd time we've been to Cafe Bink. Overall the food was excellent, but the menu could use some updating and a couple details could be improved. For example, why not serve the bread warm rather than cold?  We started with the dates, which were local, and the pulled to order mozzarella, which we particularly enjoyed - who doesn't love delicious fresh cheese. For entrees, my wife had the salmon (loved it), my sister in law had the bolognese (loved it), and I debated btw the trout and the fried chicken. I ended up with the fried chicken which was great but maybe a little heavy on the breading. I remember at least the bolognese, the trout, the fried chicken and the fish and chips from our last visit 3 years ago. I'm not sure if the menu has changed at all since then.  I joked with my wife that we were one ahi tuna stack and one molten chocolate cake away from a culinary time machine. And then we saw the chocolate puddin' cake on the dessert menu, which was basically a spoonable molten chocolate cake in a jar. It was awesome and delicious and perfect but the point still stands. We also had the doughnuts for dessert as well but they were definitely overcooked - we think the oil must not have been hot enough.  Overall everything (other than the doughnuts) tasted excellent. Great place. Nice meal.

I came to the Jean Georges Steakhouse for a group dinner hosted by some guys with whom my firm does a lot of business.  The menu had been preselected with one table-wide appetizer, and three to five choices of soup/salad, entree and dessert.  All of the choices appear on the regular menu.   The table started with the chilled seafood platter, with an awesome selection of oysters, shrimp, crab claws and crab legs. There were multiple cocktail and other sauces - I'm sure this appetizer cost a fortune, but it was truly extraordinary.   I chose the Burrata Mozzarella (salad), with tomato, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish.   How disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.  My dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent.   Two comments on the service. While it was fantastic overall (they were cool when we lingered after closing time), it was annoying when the staff kept asking whether I was having flat or sparkling water, and then when one didn't ask somebody topped off my flat water with sparkling water - not cool. Then it was annoying when a photographer cajoled us into taking a souvenir photo of the table. Then she wanted $20 for each print.  Really guys?  At Jean Georges?  Overall the dinner was great, and special thanks go to our hosts. Great place.

My wife and I came here to Sage last night.  We had great hopes, having read the great reviews, but we left disappointed.  First, we arrived 8 minutes early, but the "too hot" hostesses refused to seat us.  "I'm sorry, we're seating on time this evening.  Why don't you grab a drink at the bar.  We will get you when your table is ready."  We chose instead to walk for a couple minutes, but when we returned, even though we were still early, they sat us right away.  It was obvious they were pushing people to the bar to buy drinks before they sat down.    Second, we had one good appetizer and one we didn't like at all.  The market oysters were great, prepared with piquillo pepper and tabasco sorbet.  Probably the high point of our meal.  The low point was the much heralded foie gras custard brulee.  We love foie gras, and since it is now illegal in California, we had been looking forward to trying this dish.  We thought it was strange, soupy and inedible.  Our server asked us if we liked it, we said no, and while encouraging us to try it with more bread, she acknowledged that not everyone likes it.  Each of us only had a bite, but the server never said another word about it.  No offers to bring another appetizer - no apologies, no nothing, just indifference, and $25 on the bill.  Third, our entrees were fine.  My wife had the Morro Bay Black Cod, which was perfectly cooked with a beautiful "bar" of pumpkin flan and deliciously chewy pancetta.  I had the kobe skirt steak, which was good too, but the sweet potato puree and pecan-brown butter vinagrette that were both supposed to come with the dish were just drizzles under the pile of sliced meat - there was barely enough to get the meat wet much less add much flavor.    We finished with the caramelized layer cake - good flavors but it tasted old and stale.  Plus the crumbled slice looked like it was cut by our toddler.  We wondered if they scraped together the last bits of cake from the night before.  OK, so the bottom line is that for us Sage didn't live up to its reviews and its price point.  It was pretentious and overrated, and for $250 for two, we expected better.

This was my second visit to China Poblano, although my first visit was last year and it was limited to a couple dumplings and some drinks.  This time my wife and I came for lunch while the Cosmopolitan was getting our room ready.  The restaurant has one of the cooler buildouts in town - stylish and chic yet still comfortable.  The design aesthetic borrows from Chinese and Mexican traditions, much like the menu.  What was interesting to us was that we didn't sense much "fusion" between the two traditions - they menu is segregated between Chinese and Mexican dishes.  We had a mix, but no single dish we had really fused the two cusines.  Let's start off with a story.  Just after we sat down, a party of 4 sat next to us.  After a quick look at the menu they asked the server why they didn't see quesadillas and burritos.  The server explained that China Poblano's Mexican fare comes from the cuisine of Southern Mexico, while they were thinking more about the food along the US border.  The server expertly encouraged them to give the place a try, and they wouldn't be disappointed.  No dice - they got up and left anyway.  The server told us that happens a lot.  That was their loss.  We started with the special Chicken Tinga Tacos with chorizo, onions and potatoes, which my wife and I LOVED.  The potatoes in particular made the tacos, and they went great with the sauce, one of my favorites in the Mexican lexicon.  We also really enjoyed the Don't Be Jealous Hot and Sour Soup.  This was not your traditional Chinese hot and sour soup - the color was much darker, the sesame flavor really popped, as did the cilantro.  It had much more depth than we expected and was almost smoky.    Of the Lucky 6 Sui Mai, we liked the scallop sui mai the best, then the beef and then the traditional shrimp & pork.  All were delicious though, and sui mai is always a personal favorite, whatever anyone puts in it.    The Shrimp Mojo was good too, but the shrimp was a little overwhelmed by the sweet black roasted garlic.  It was a good dish, but I'd have preferred a little bit more shrimp flavor.   Fun place with good food, but you have to like Chinese and Southern Mexican flavors, which my wife and I absolutely do.

We really enjoyed our meal at Citizen Public House.  Our first move was to order drinks - my wife's sangria was particularly refreshing.   Our first bite was the optional bread service, served with a notably good olive oil. For starters we had the much acclaimed chopped salad. I typically don't address salads much in my reviews, but this salad was one of the highlights of the meal and our trip - it was awesome for a couple reasons. First, the flavors were great.  I didn't catch all the components, but the freeze-dried corn added crunch, and the protein came from smoked salmon. Second, the theater of the salad presentation and preparation was awesome. The server presented the salad with its ingredients nearly arranged in rows, and he added the awesome buttermilk dressing and tossed it at the table. The results were amazing. Our second starter was the Chia Seared Tuna, with purple sticky rice, asparagus pur√©e, fried leaks and greens. The colors and presentation were great but the flavors were more muted. We liked it and it was fine but it was far overshadowed by the salad.   For entrees my wife had the scallops and I had the filet. The scallops were exceptional - perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned on a puddle of creamy and buttery grits. Loved them. The filet was fine but not really exceptional. I liked it a lot and the preparation was fine but it wasn't really all that memorable. I did like it though. I really wanted the scallops but decided not to order the same entree as my wife.   For dessert we had the brownie sundae, which was good but not exceptional. The brown butter ice cream was a little icy - not offensively so, but it didn't taste like it was made same-day. The brownies were ok too.  The bartender was particularly attentive (in a good way). My brother-in-law (to be) was interested in trying a couple varieties of Scotch and the bartender came to our table and delighted in detailing his thoughts and letting him taste several options.   One more comment on Citizen Public House is that it could really be anywhere - from the menu you wouldn't know you were in the Southwest - I didn't see even a single solitary chili pepper on the menu.   Recap: chopped salad, scallops and service were all high points. Great place. Thumbs up.

The other night we were looking for a family-friendly pizza place with pasta as well for a party of 8, including kids.  Brugos fit all of our criteria, the pizza was decent and yet we didn't love the place.    Right when we sat down, our server announced they were out of kids drink cups- OK, fine.  Can we have some bread to get the kids started?  No bread?  You want to sell us cheesy breadsticks instead?  Ok, let's look at the menu.  The sandwiches look interesting, but they are only available at lunch.  So lets start with the dinner salads instead.  Hmmm, they are fine but dull.  Wait, why do I need to keep my fork for my entree?  Can't you wash this one and give me a new one?  Our table's reaction to the pizza was mixed.  Some thought it was really good.  I thought it was average.  We had the Meatball Pizza and the Chrissy's Special.  We didn't have dessert but I do love Molten Lava Cake...  I also had trouble getting past the ripped upholstery on the booth seats and a couple of our chairs.    Overall the place was fine, and our server was really nice, but I don't see us going back the next time we're in town...

My wife and I were in Las Vegas recently, and I found Lobster Me at the Milennium Shops attached to Planet Hollywood by googling "Best Lobster Roll Las Vegas."  My wife is allergic to lobster, so I don't get a lot of lobster rolls at home.  Not that I could anyway - we live in San Diego, where good lobster rolls are hard to come by.  That's why I googled away - I had some time, and, having spent some time in Northern New England, I love a good lobster roll.    I tried "The Original 'Maine Style" lobster roll, which the menu describes as "Maine Lobster served with a touch of mayo and lemon and topped with our secret spice blend."  Additionally, the menu notes that "all rolls [are] served on our toasted, New England-style, split-top bun."   Big chilled chunks of lobster meat, perfect claw pieces on top, the mayo, the aroma of butter, the bun itself - it was great and it really hit the spot.  Was this the best lobster roll I'd ever had?  No, but I'm in Las Vegas a lot more often that I'm in Maine, and this roll was exactly what I wanted.  This roll was also powers of ten better than what I can find in my home city.  I'm already looking forward to going back again the next time I'm in town.  Other items on the Lobster Me menu sounded great, including the other varieties of lobster rolls and especially the breakfast options, but I will probably get the classic Maine Style roll next time too.

Nobu has it all - celebrity guests, a famous name, wonderful food and a HUGE price point.    We had a group of 10 that included family and friends, so instead of ordering a la carte we went with the Nobu Signature option on the Omakase menu, where the chefs craft a custom menu in real time based on our group's expressed preferences, allergies, etc. The price per person was big but since it was basically all-in and we were there for a special visit, why not.   The food was 5 stars. The miso cod was fantastic, the wagyu beef tacos were amazing, the yellowtail sashimi with jalape√±os were divine, the grilled premium Japan wagyu beef was delicious and the dessert assortment they brought out was one for the ages. Best bite of the night was the first one - the salmon tartare topped with caviar in a wasabi soy broth with a mystery berry of some unknown origin (unknown to me) on the side - that dish was superlative-worthy on its own.  I didn't love our shrimp dish, but that good was far outweighed by a whole lot of great.   The cost ended up being crazy high.  My buddy handled the accounting but what I think happened was that on top of the Omakase went the pre-order appetizer and the cocktails. And when the server suggested the sake that she said paired great with the desserts, we didn't realize it apparently wasn't part of the prix fixe menu.  Either that or there was some sort of misunderstanding.  No regrets. Had a wonderful, truly memorable meal with a great group.  Worth (almost) every penny.

Good place even if it seems to trend a little too hipster for my taste. We flew into the airport and wanted a quick lunch before moving on to our destination. We found the Public Market Cafe on YELP, and the market itself was packing up when we arrived. The cafe serves breakfast until 3 pm so I went for the breakfast burrito. The burrito must have had 3 or 4 eggs - it was huge and full of cheese and bacon and best of all it was grilled - I love that. Tasted great. My wife ordered a salad but was a little annoyed when the dude at the register pointed her to the premade salads in the display case. Had she known it was already in plastic she would have ordered something fresher. The star of the meal was my daughter's bagel. The strawberry cream cheese I could have done without, but the bagel itself was homemade (in the restaurant) and it was fantastic. On the way out we picked up another 3 bagels to-go for breakfasts during our trip.

The Fry Bread House is a tough place to figure out.  We've been to this establishment three times at two locations [they didn't add a 2nd restaurant - it was a relocation], and now according to the lady behind the counter they are moving yet again in February. On our previous visit, they had been open at this property for only 3 months - now they are packing up to move yet again.  I'd rather of course that the Owners find success wherever the are, but maybe deep down I'm kinda just a little bit more hopeful now because I think it'll work out better for the Owners in the long run to take this saloon outa Dodge. This current venue lacks personality and reads more like a big generic cafeteria or meeting hall. The awesome food deserves a better context. We hope The Fry Bread House can find the charm and magic of their first location, where we first waited in a line out the door.   Their food is fantastic. They won a freakin' James Beard "America's Classics" award designation in 2012 - totally true. Google it. It is a very big deal.  I've had their green chili beef stew (awesome), their green chili beef taco with beans (fabulous), and most recently their ultimate fry bread taco with the red chili beef. The green chili is definitely hotter than the red, but the red has great flavors with just the right amount of heat. I love them both but my favorite bite here is always the rich, smooth and oh so decadent refried beans. Love the beans.   My kids always devour the coyote coins, which are little fry bread circles served with their signature refried beans smothered in cheese. So simple but so good. On our most recent visit my son left the coyote coins to my daughter and had the Cheese crisp on chumuth, which he loved as well. Also very simple.   Love this place, wherever they locate. Let's all do our part to keep this treasure in business. And thriving.

We liked Glow Putt so much we went back the very next day. They've been open about 5 months, and the concept is awesome. I may be dating myself but this is mini-Golf meets Tron. They took poorly performing unproductive retail space, painted some wood to glow in the dark, added fluorescent lighting (to charge the paint after hours), some black lights and some imagination and voila, we have glow in the dark mini golf. It is dark enough to appreciate the concept but still bright enough to see your way around. My 7 year old and 5 year old both loved it, as did the rest of the family. The owners thought of everything - even the scorecard on the mini-clipboard glows, and it hangs from a lanyard around your neck. You get a glowing bracelet, and the clubs and balls glow too. The cost is reasonable, and the owner and staff are all super nice. The holes are much more simple than at the more traditional mini golf venues around town - here there are no windmills, but you don't miss the bells, whistles and animation of the other places. My son loved to charge the ball every few holes, and especially on hole #17. The silly wheel to spin on #11 was a nice touch. 8 and 15 are deceptively simple and too short, but still challenging.  My favorite hole is 13 - I think that's the one with the pinball action where the ball drains to a lower level.  Glow putt is a great concept, and it is very well executed.

Ok, so let's dish about the PHX Car Rental Center's Early Bag Check Counter. Sounds like a great idea, right?  Check your bags when you return your car to the car rental facility so you can travel light to the terminal and proceed directly to the TSA security line. There are several items you should note before planning to utilize this service.   First, the participating airlines are limited. If you are flying on American, United or Southwest, then you're in luck. Other airlines?  Sorry - proceed to the terminal with your bags per usual. We were on Southwest so we checked this box.   Second, they have a strict, firm, draconian, no exceptions 90 minute cutoff before your flight's SCHEDULED departure time. The entire transaction needs to be completed before this window closes. This is where we got tripped up. We returned our car with time to spare and hopped in the line, but due to the clueless attendant's bumbling with the customer ahead of us and with our bags, we ended up missing the cutoff by 11 minutes when he was FINALLY ready to print our tags. I tried so hard not to be a jerk (and I'm trying now too, mostly) but this guy seemed so lost back there - he was literally counting the bags ahead of ours with his fingers, and it took him three tries to get to six. We thought we were still ok because the board RIGHT THERE showed our flight delayed by 30 minutes, so we were still 1 HR 40 MIN before our estimated departure.  Didn't matter. The system locked the attendant out. So not only were we denied, but we still had to cart all our bags to the terminal to wait in the next line having lost 30 minutes of our lives that we can never get back from that black hole of idiocy. Bad personnel + bad system = Useless.   And third, to add insult to injury, I didn't appreciate the "Gratuities are welcome for excellent service" and "Gratuities accepted" signs. How about using that precious counter space and sign area to explain the 90 minute rule. So frustrating.  The rigid cutoff needs to be pushed back to 60 minutes or even 75, and they gotta take into account flight delays. Otherwise, nobody will use it so why bother having it in the first place.
