Looking for a true Phoenix experience? Here you go. You show up for happy hour and instead you get cockroaches. The food isn't great. The service isn't bad. The roaches are a wonderful effect of bringing together the "Phoenix vibe".

Good food and drink. But customer service is awful. Just be be careful who's on staff they might bite. Do not get the Bloody Mary. Buy the garlic fries and the burgers are great.

Great place that helped my friend Tino. They speak Spanish here. I would come back here in a heartbeat!

The customer service at this location is inadequate. There is a blond girl at the front who was incredibly kind. The reps need some assistance in how to be kind to their customers and what customer service actually is. It's an uncomfortable entitlement issue. If you don't care how they treat you they will get the job done. However if you want an even somewhat pleasant experience go to a different store.

Straight up best customer service I've experienced from Tiffany. We wanted to tell her manager but she was the shift lead. She was so good at her job our first experience made it become now a regular experience thanks Tiffany also the ice is so good.

Amazing. I am super picky with bistros but this one is excellent. Dog friendly , brought my pup. We got the bruschetta and pasta with some soup and salad. Excellent. The creamy mushroom Marcella pasta sooooooo good. I would recommend to anyone. Great place.
