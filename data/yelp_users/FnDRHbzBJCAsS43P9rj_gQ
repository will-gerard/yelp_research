Just EH. Everything is average. Nothing spectacular. Chips weren't fresh, tasted like they came out of a bag. All the "salsas" are cream based, I asked for a fresh tomato salsa and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy.   So many better places, try any food truck in Phoenix.  Wouldn't call it "Mexican" at all.
