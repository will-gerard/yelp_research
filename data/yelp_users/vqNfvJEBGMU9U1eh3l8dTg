Went last night and it was ridiculously bad. The waitress took our order but after about 25 minutes, the sushi hadn't come. Then she comes back and says there's a "mixup" at the sushi station and she RETAKES our sushi order, saying its "getting plated". It took another 20 minutes for the rolls to come out and they came out one by one. They were tasteless, probably because she had the chefs make them in a rush due to having forgotten our order entirely. No apology, no regard, nothing. I'm never going back there again.

First time here. Had the spicy tuna roll and the Stuffed Jalape√±o. Delicious! Really attentive service and friendly staff, too.
