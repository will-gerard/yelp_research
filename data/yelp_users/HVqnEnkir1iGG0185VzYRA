I went here with a groupon deal for half off for my birthday. Kart racing was a blast and the facility was very nice. If you don't have the groupon I think it's way over priced but would return if prices where more like the groupon rate.

I have been going to Saguaro Vetinary Clinic for over two years with my dogs and cats. The staff is always friendly and they can usually fit in a visit on short notice if an emergency comes up. I have seen Dr. Esposito and Dr. Ketchmar and both have taken excellent care if my pets and always kept me informed of different treatment options. I would never take my pets anywhere else!!   Only con is there can be a little bit of a wait.

Just picked up a pair of unfinished denim that I had hemmed by J. The hem looks really good and I asked him to match the original hem and he did a great job at that. I am taking away one star as he took my phone number like he would call when they where ready but I ended up having to call to make sure they where done. Also he charged me double to match the hem which only required adding a bit of red stitching which I thought was a little much. As an added note there is a language barrier so you may not be sure exactly what your getting but I was happy with the result despite this. Overall I will return when I need a garment altered.

This used to be my favorite Chipotle but over the past two years the food quality has gone down hill. The chicken is consistently burnt and sometimes the mild salsa is tasteless, on the other hand the staff is always friendly. If your hungry for Chipotle drive the extra 5 minutes to 92nd street and Shea and you won't be disappointed.

My go to Chipotle in Scottsdale. I have been to pretty much every Chipotle in Scottsdale and non of them compare to this location. The food is always seasoned perfectly and the chicken is never burnt. Staff is always friendly and my internet orders are always waiting for me when I get there.

Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!

I went here on a Wednesday to watch a good friend ride a bull on amateur bull riding night. The atmosphere was really cool with campfires and the old times bar. Waitstaff was really friendly and even had drink service in the grand stands. I did not eat so I cannot comment on the food. Overall if you want a cool place to grab a drink with free entertainment this is a great place!!!

Stopped in for a quick beer. After finishing my usual beer the bartender recommended something off there limited menu, it wasn't my kind of beer so he exchanged it for something else. Friendly service for sure. Will always return for there large selection of draft beer.

Wow never thought i'd be so disappointed with a big name like Fleming's. I dined here with my wife for a late valentines day since we where both working on the 14th.   I'll start off with the good: the service was friendly, on point, and knowledgable about the menu. The appetizers were good mushroom ravioli and french onion soup as well as the steaks cooked just as ordered and very tasty.   The bad: a la carte menus mucho dinero for a little steak and nothing else. The side I ordered, asparagus, was pretty scorched on the bottom for the price they should be cooked perfectly. My wife ordered a special lobster tail, small filet, and Flemings potatoes. Lobster tail was way overcooked to the point were the waiter could barely get it out of the shell and it tasted like rubber, the potatoes were bland and could have used more seasoning and to top it off the plates were hotter than hell like they had been left up in the salamander for to long. Lastly the restaurant was just a little to warm and caused us to sweat through our meal.   Overall I will certainly not be returning and would not recommend to a friend.  2/20/2014 Update- the restaurant manager contacted the the next day after reading my review and sent a gift card to give Flemings another shot, I will update my review when we revisit this location.

Love love love this place. Best burger anywhere! I really don't know what to say always a smiling face at the register always a delicious burger fries can be hit or miss and this place can get pretty busy sometimes. My favorite is a double double with grilled onions always a good choice.

I love this Costco location, it has a much better selection of wines and other alcohol then other warehouses I have visited. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Don't forget to bring cash for the food court!

I just had a trailer hitch installed by Scott and I am so happy with the quality job he did. I brought in my own wiring harness from the manufacture and he took the time to install it into the bumper requiring him to drill a hole in it. The result is an install that looks better than OEM. He also switched the parts around so I got a small refund. Couldn't be happier.

Pretty good gym, it is the smallest of 24 hour fitness's levels but is certainly a clean gym with functioning equipment and friendly staff. It can get pretty crowded during the busy hours, mornings and afternoons, but since I typically go at off times it doesn't affect me to much. This place looses one star for only having one squat rack and closing at 9 on Saturday and Sunday! If you live in the neighborhood it is a great affordable gym to be a member of.

Just had an exterior wash, polish, and sealant from the guys at Gannon and I am very impressed with their service. They where very punctual, showed up early for our scheduled appointment, very professional, both detailers where wearing uniforms and drove a clearly marked van and explained the detail process and what results to expect. Communication was great as my call for a appointment was returned almost immediately. When they where done my car looked 100x better than before, the light scratches and swirl marks that made my car look dull and worn where almost all gone and my car shined beautifully. Best of all they are competitively priced compared to other mobile detailers in the area. Check out after pictures of my car if you have any doubt!

Brett came and picked up my car when it left my wife stranded on the roadside. He arrived faster than the quoted time was very friendly and problem solved when I found out I didn't have a tow hook for my car. He also was knowledgable about my car and new how to get it in neutral when it wouldn't power on. Definitely would recommend.

I accidentally stumbled into this place while trying to get to another pizza place that is right down the street and it sure was a bad mistake. The theme here is kinda like night club meets dirty strip bar with shitty house music and terrible decor. The staff just left me standing at the counter for like five minutes before taking my order and when I got the Za's they where greasy as hell, the sauce had no flavor, and the dough was not good at all. Unless you are super drunk and need a places that is open at 5 am stay away!

I have visited twice here during happy hour a will absolutely return. We had two spicy rolls (yellowtail and tuna), salmon and yellowtail nigiri, and a dragon roll with a sake bomb and mixed drink and our tab was only $35!! What a steal. The sushi was great only complaint was the spicy rolls did look a bit sloppy. My wife loved her Tokyo Stock Exchange (mixed drink with vodka  ginger basil and lime). Service was attentive but defiantly did not seem thrilled in any sense to be at work. Will definitely return for happy hour when I'm in the mood for some good cheap sushi and drinks!!

I have had a brake fluid service and oil service here and the service is top notch. Both times I made an appointment and my car was taken immediately back and the work was completed within an hour. They offer a complimentary hand wash with service but it takes and additional 20-30 minutes. Pricing is very competitive compared to dealer service and only a few dollars more than Jiffy Lube for the oil change. They share the location with Beemer Haus so look for their signage.

I just got my windows tinted by Cactus Tint with SunTek Hp 35/15 and could not be happier with the service Rick and his crew provided.   When I first stopped in Rick showed me all the tint options available and the pros and cons of each. I went with the least expensive option which is a metallic tint that Rick warned could interfere with AM radio, I have found this not to be the case and get no interference with any electronics.   When I brought my car in for my appointment they had my tint selection saved on there computer and got my car done 30 minutes after their quoted time. The reason they went over was because they had to redo the rear windshield because the installer didn't think it was up to par. Much better to have it taken care of the first time then waiting to see if id notice it!! Waiting was not a big deal as they have comfy couches and a nice TV selection.   I know that in the future if I ever have problems Rick will handle them and he will definitely be my go to tint guy for any future needs. Highly recommended!!!!

Great convenient location for my favorite Asian food. The food is generally good the only thing negative I have to say is sometimes the tofu can come out soggy but most of the time it is crisp and delicious. My favorite dish is the sesame chicken with fried rice. The staff here is always friendly and they have freestyle coca cola machines at this location! Would recommend for anyone looking for fast, fresh, and tasty Asian food.

I purchased a car from Scottsdale Motor Company in August of 2013 and could not be happier with the car nor the car buying experience. I visited the dealer several times to test drive the car and was met by smiling friendly faces every time I stopped in. When we decide to purchase it we where able to negotiate a fair price. The paperwork was easy and painless and the car was nicely detailed before we picked it up just as promised. The best part about the whole transaction was not having them call me every waking minute trying to make some sort of deal. I will defiantly be searching their inventory in the future when looking to purchase a car.

Had a 14" carry out pizza and it was pretty good . Crust was nice and crispy toppings were adequate and the Canadian bacon they use is amazing!! Only thing negative to say is if you like more than a hint of sauce, ask for extra.

Hands down best haircut in Scottsdale. I have been to many other barbershops in Scottsdale and been disappointed by the haircut I received, but  Shaving Grace is a cut above the rest. I have had my haircut by several of the barbers who work here and have never left disappointed. Bottom line if you wanna look sharp head over to Shaving Grace.
