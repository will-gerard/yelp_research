After an airport pickup, my company wanted some authentic Mexican. Took to Yelp to help us out and we were sadly let down. The service was abysmal. Our server came the second we sat down to get our food and drink order, but never having dined there we had no idea what to get. After some time spent talking and eating the salsa from the hottest depths of hell, we realized we hadn't see her in around 20 minutes so we asked for someone to take our order.  Let me just say, I'm not cheap (swear!) I just hate getting ripped off. We ordered one machaca chimi with rice and beans and another exactly the same but not deep fried, got it? The bill read $10 for the first one and $14 for the second. The menu reads you can get anything deep fried for an additional $1, so why the heck was I charged $4 for saving the cook time and precious fryer oil? DUMB.   Other notable annoyances: they were out of horchata with no answer to when more would be made, the beans were nearly white- too much lard?, the machaca beef was inedible due to many crispy/nasty/grisly bits, the server never came back to check on us or any tables around us after the food was dropped off.   We left both our meals on the table and will not be back. Ever.    Never, ever.

Great care for our pup and super understanding when I'm a crazy dog mom. We switched from Banfield and haven't looked back.

Great care for our pup and super understanding when I'm a crazy dog mom. We switched from Banfield and haven't looked back.   Update: While I appreciate your response Haley, we had an absolutely terrible experience yesterday. I won't change my rating, as Dr. Schroeder is really great. We will never agree to an appointment with Dr. Clemens again.

Tiffany is the bees knees. Love that you don't have to have an appointment but get in right on time if you do. Best fill and pedi I've had in a long time. I think the name is Ellei Nails though, not Elle.

In the last year our experiences here have been SO much better. Maybe it's because we've stopped ordering take out from the untrained teens at the host stand and sitting on the patio where you're ignored for an hour. We've stuck to the bar and been happy campers ever since.

We really love it here! Four pool tables, good bad-for-you food and great service from the guy bartender. The only things we weren't  by thrilled were the female bartender (tight blonde curls and SUPER rude to everyone in our party) & the ranch was pure buttermilk with no flavor. Regardless, we will be back to give it another shot!

Talley's fits the bill for some well-poured & cheap drinks, super tasty potato skins, and a decent shot at a pool table. Pretty sure they stop cooking at 10pm.

The single most disgusting sushi experience I've ever had. Asian nachos were burned and tasteless, April and Toosties rolls were totally bland and the texture was way off, the crab wontons came with some funky nasty sauce.. Blahhhh. $50 down the toilet.

So dirty!!! Hair in our food three visits in a row and everything you order is saturated and butter or oil. No thank you! Especially not with Snooze, Luci's  and Daily Dose so close. Time to revamp!!

Good but certainly not exceptional. It's a chain, so the food is pretty standard. The employees could be happier and/or quicker.

You will not find one thing on this menu that is not crazy flavorful. Great ambiance, locally sourced food, never rushed service. Check out the corn cakes, eggplant bites, and cedar plank salmon.

The good news (sorta?): Pizza on regular crust was deeelish & wings were flavorful but barely cooked. The turrrible news: Our server started out the six top with "I'm new, you're gonna have to bear with me." Boy did we try but- 1)wrong sized beers delivered 2)no refills on fountain drinks 3)no napkins/straws/cutlery 4)food took 40 min so I'm guessing she forgot to ring it   Manager: whyyy put someone on the floor before they're ready? Maybe you're short staffed but you're clearly losing customers due to poor service (source: rough yelp reviews) It was painfully obvious she needed a little training.

I've found it!! After more nasty Chinese takeout than I care to recall, I happened upon Jenny and her fabulous little spot. We had the house chicken with pan fried noodles ($5 up charge) and the crab puffs. The house sauce was a garlicky wonder with a peppery kick and the right amount of scallions. The noodles were firm and there was actually crab (albeit the fake stuff but whatever) in the little puffy deep fried pockets of heaven. The price was steep, $23 for the dish with noodles subbed instead of rice and the side.   On another note, there was no one in the place and no other orders being made at 7pm on a Thursday. I hope the community gets behind this little treasure- miss Jenny was so sweet and man, she can cook!

Well, that was fun! The husband and I couldn't pass up the chance to check out a $1.99 margarita. We should have. It was reminiscent of lemon-lime Gatorade and theraflu. So what was so fun, you ask? The super sweet greeting by every person we walked in to, the great service from a guy wearing awesome pleather pants and a Gucci belt, the good food (Baja burro, yeah! Fish tacos, nahh!), the birds hanging basically every 1.5 feet throughout the joint & how could I leave out the complimentary Mexican kamikaze! It was probably the nastiness shot of my life but there was no way I was leaving it on the table when no one else in the place received one. We will be back, likely with hidden mini-shots for our margs, but we'll be back.

HORRIFIC. Do you people have taste buds? Four stars, you lunatics?! 1: crack head paradise outside of the "restaurant". 2. filthy inside with the yummalicous smell of old grease and grime. (why I proceeded to order I have no frickin clue). 3. pretty stupid expensive. $10 for a small plate for one 4. the food. YUCK. Got home, tried one bite of everything and threw it all away immediately to avoid eminent poisoning. Sesame chicken: unable to be chewed, tougher than deep fried leather with about the same taste. Beef with broccoli. The beef was creamy white. End of story on that one. Crab puffs: the middle was decent but the outside was so overcooked it was hard to get to. Egg roll: my sister bit down and spit it directly on the table. She's dramatic but not that dramatic. Lo mein: tasted exactly like old stinky cabbage.   The sign near the register read "no refunds" so I didn't bother calling. The sweaty guy working the register and the grill probably wouldn't have cared anyway.

I cannot say enough about the impeccable experience I've had at Dynamite Creek. Alvin was the most comforting, professional, and understanding tech (even despite my anxiety being about six million times higher than usual). Dr. H was equally caring. We are three days post op on our Paisley's ACL surgery and doing great. I genuinely appreciate the dedication, Dynamite Creek!

ZERO STARS.  Whatever it takes- do not stay here. I called for two double beds for 4 girls to just crash after the Buffalo Chip. Josh was totally great over the phone and equally hospitable in person. I paid $110 with tax, got the key and was about to walk to the room. Some random girl who did not identify herself as working there, nor have a badge on, questioned me on the girls waiting in my car. IN MY CAR. I explained that they were waiting for me to get the key, when she told me I was going to be charged extra. Some other lady walked in and they all started in on extra people fees, how we were going to need towels for everyone (clearly I'll need loads of towels, for a 10pm check in, crashing at 3 am and leaving by 9 am), and it's just the way it is. I explained that kind and courteous Josh was told over the phone that there would be 4 girls, but of course he didn't cop to that in front of crazy and crazier. The older lady was literally the most unprofessional person I have encountered thus far in my 26 years. She was HORRIBLE. She said, if you don't like it go home. But of course there's a 7 day cancellation fee. I went out to ask the girls if they were good with $130 and walked back in to another round of all three of them talking at me about more bull.  Got to the room and immediately searched the bed after one of the girls in the car looked the place up on Yelp to find claims of bed bugs. Whadddaya know? A teensy little black bug on the edge of the bed frame. Should have taken a picture, but whatever. There was no one to call since they closed the lobby after we checked in. Super.   Just please, for heaven's sake, take cab to somewhere in Carefree. They deserve to go out of business.

I'm all about the $5 special. Two slices (I stick all sorts of free peppers on them, can you say cheapo?) and a drink! The guys at the counter are kind even though they're usually super busy. You can get a large for like $10 too. Good sauce & great crisp crust- I'm in!

I stopped in for drinks one night and was captivated by the incredible smells.  Naturally I returned a night later and ordered the special, mahi mahi with pineapple salsa, some fancy GCP potato that sounded delish and veggies. Oh, there was salad too but it was as dreadful as the food so I forgot. Salt salt and more salt!!!! The fish was flavorless and so so dry, the potatoes and veggie were pure salt. So sad. Two stars for great service.

Carolina's is the perfect place for a quick lunch without all the fuss. Quality, inexpensive food with kind service in a clean environment- oh, and it's absolutely delicious. That matters too ya know. I doubt there's a bad menu choice here but I've had and would recommend the machaca plate with tortillas (order two!) and rice and beans, chicken tacos and the apple chimis.

Ught oh. Just found this place at over 40 weeks preggers and now I'm going to want it when I'm tryna get my skinny back. Damn. Well anyway, we had the chocolate malt shake (subbed chocolate concrete instead of the vanilla base they normally use cause duhh) & the vanilla concrete mixer with peanut butter and Reese's. Didn't eat all the foods cause I currently live on ice cream. maybe next time.

At 38 weeks pregnant, the last thing I want to deal with is a root canal. I called offices all day to find someone to see me, and Sheryl was an absolute God send. She got me in front of the doctor within the hour, worked with out out of network insurance and provided referrals for the procedure at an endodontist. Thank you to her, Maria and Dr. Ferguson for excellent care.

My favorite Fili-B's location, and believe me I've been to them all. The interior is clean and the food is consistently good. Not thrilled with the chains recent price increase at every store, though. The convenience of the the drive thru and 24 hour availability keeps us coming back, but during regular business hours and when we're not in a rush you'll find us at Carolina's just down the street.

The absolute worst. 35 times out of 40 this year we have had horrible service. We come back for the food but are allllways upset about the lack of care from servers. Wrong orders, food comes at staggered times, drinks and food have come an hour after we sat down numerous times, managers offer $5 zipps bucks instead of taking care of issues. This place ONLY survives off good, cheap food.  Calling corporate asap. Someone fix this place!!!!!

Outstanding breakfast with unremarkable and lackluster service. My husband had the ham omelette with toast and fresh marmalade, super fresh fruit and perfect potatoes with sautéed onions. I had the side mixed berry protein pancake ($3.25 and it was huge!) and a side egg which was cooked perfectly. Service was iffy. She hit all the key points without much interest and we waited a long time to eat, maybe forgot to put it in? The meal was $15 and we couldn't finish it. Good  service or not, we will come back.

After five visits, the service keeps getting worse. I thought I'd try take out to avoid that but even that person was just plain angry. I'm a server too, and I LOVE my job and use my hour with people to make others days better... Maybe try that?

Such a fun lunch! We went with a traditional turkey/avocado/tomato type (#20) and something a little different, a turkey/almond/cranberry/apple choice (#10). Both had an awesome tangy mustard sauce and we super satisfying. The hubs and I usually share but opted not to from other Yelp reviews. It was a good call; he devoured his and I ate almost all of mine.   The price was about $8.50 a sandwich, not bad at all but I would have rather not had the price of the side dish built in, as I didn't like any of the choices- kale salad/potato & black bean salad/garbanzo bean& corn salad. We went with the potato but it wasn't good.   We will definitely be back to try the breakfast options (served all day!) and one of the dessert sandwiches also.

Get it together Dunkin. Simple orders are repeatedly wrong and they're literally always out of something vital to the standard iced coffee.

Went for a concert, which was amazing. The  crazy expensive and totally disgusting cold food was unbelievable. There were not nearly enough tables for the kitchen to have a problem putting out hot food and the quality was shameful. I could find better selections at Costco.

I might be the biggest fan of hole in the wall places with great food in Phoenix, but the service here was so lacking I doubt I'd ever be back. The host threw a huge fit when we requested a small booth for two rather than a table, then I spilled my water allll over the place on accident & the waitress left me soaked for a little then tossed three napkins my way. The sushi itself was worth 4 stars for sure.

Love it.. Wine, games, fun beers, pretty good sweet treats are all good but the service- that's where it's at. Dumb example: Greg once gave us a cookie for moving down a seat to make room. I'm stupid for remembering that... yes, but that's the way to present your business if you want to keep people coming back.

Don't judge a book, or Urban Taco, by its cover. It's SO cute inside. I'd steal everything but the Christmas lights in a second. Adorbs. The owners are obviously present and involved & the service was attentive but not overbearing- loved it. Moving on. The food is good but not great. The 4 street tacos all had the same toppings but different proteins. Boring. The rice was horrible... could have easily been six days old and left on the counter. The salsas weren't much better- the chimichurri tasted exactly like creamy pesto, another tasted like pasta or vodka sauce and the garlic one was reminiscent of thick garlic aioli. But wait!! The corn side dish with poblanos and onions was the stuff my dreams are made of, the refried beans & veggie taco my friend had looked super good... so I'll be back!!

Moderately friendly staff but not knowledgable in the least unfortunately. I spend a good amount with the beauty insider club but this location will never honor any of the promotions- they consistently refer me to go to a standalone store. I guess I should listen and take my business elsewhere.

What's left to say that hasn't already been said?  I'll try. The setup really is so awkward. It's like they didn't want to do counter service but had no real interest in full service either- so they just muddled the two to all oblivion.   Two employees (tried to) explain the process and we were still left confused and honestly a little frustrated before we even sat down. Order at the counter in the back middle of the place, walk backwards get your own drink and condiments, try hard to remember the table number you were told 8 minutes ago, sit down and wait. You're then repeatedly told that you're now receiving "full service" when you just did everything the same as if you were at let's say a Chipotle. I've served for 12 years and id still never leave 20%. I FRIGGIN DID EVERYTHING.   The food was decent but for $30 I'll go to Smashburger and have a feast, not two (smallish, super dry, and overcooked) burgers and one side of fries with a forced gratuity.

Central Phoenix asked & Luci's Urban Concepts answered in spades.   Luci's at the Orchard is an incredible property, fit for just about anyone. The counter service restaurant offers great customer service and incredible food that leans more toward really-freakin-well-done comfort food than Luci's Healthy Marketplace @ 16th/Bethany. They do have salads -I hear- but I can't take a break eating the French toast and chicken sandwich to find out.   Also found within the Luci's space at the Orchard is a retail market with adorable trinkets, perfect gifts and plenty of other odds and ends you'll just have to have. There's a fully stocked bar with beer, liquor and wine in the middle and can't forget Splurge- the sweet little gelato shop. Try the "Mint to be for Nick" flavor, it's super good and is named in honor of a local boy fighting a terminal illness.   You'll be hard pressed to find a better patio in Uptown. The Splashpad & surrounding tables is a great space for little ones and their families while the front porch & accompanying rocking chairs  are perfect for a quiet escape.
