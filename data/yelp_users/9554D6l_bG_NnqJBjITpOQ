Great doctors here but expect your app to take up half your day. There isn't a single time I've been here and didn't wait over a hour in the waiting room. Their lack of respect for their patients time is disappointing. Not a single apology either.

The food and service was exceptional. Jenny was our server and made our first experience at the keg an unforgettable one! Cant wait to come back!

This is probably one of my new favorite places. I've been in a few different times now and it was fabulous every time! The Bloody Mary was so spicy delicious! A great stop to come in with friends and enjoy a glass of wine and great ambiance. Only complaint I have is that my server had a weird response when I asked if I could sub arugula in the grapefruit salad. He said "ehhh you might be asking for too much there because arugula is more expensive than mixed greens".... I've never heard of that before, but umm okay? I wasn't gonna say anything about how I thought it was a weird response, but my friends even brought it up how odd the conversation was after he left. I'm in the industry as well and I would have got an earful from my manager if he knew I told a customer that. It was pretty awkward, but I still love the place nonetheless.   I would have given this place 5 starts if it wasn't for that.
