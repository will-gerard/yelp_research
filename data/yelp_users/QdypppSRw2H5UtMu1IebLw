One of my vendors uses this bakery a lot for gifts. I have had several of their sugar cookies and let me say, they are THE BEST sugar cookies I've ever had, ever. They're moist, sweet, and simply melt in your mouth with goodness.

Ok ok so this place looks like a dump, yes. HOWEVER I have been here a few times for the burgers and wings and they are delish! Burgers are made to order, exactly how you ask for them. Normally I order a burger medium and it comes well well well done. Here you order it medium, there it is nicely light pink and juicy. And the wings....ah the wings. If you are a hot wing fan like I am, you will appreciate them. They are big, juicy, and crispy. I like them medium flavor and they are just spicy enough. Service is decent, decor is dated, but the food is worth the trip.

If you LOVE metal, like I do, you'll love this place. It's great!!!!! Fancy? No. Pretty people? Ha, no. Great live music? YES. Cheap drinks? YES. Fun atmosphere? YES. I love love love this place. When I want to go hang out after a long week and listen to some great bands, I come here. Cover is usually cheap like $8-10 and on a Friday or Saturday night, that gets you 3-5 bands, so that's a steal. I love the set up, you can walk right up to the stage and rock out in front or you can sit and the tables on each side of the bar, directly in front of the stage. I always sit at a front table and have an amazing time. I leave partially deaf, but hey, that's half the fun, right? I've aquired some new bands to my collection that I otherwise never would have heard of. That to me is priceless. Check this place out for sure.

Love the red chicken enchiladas, they're spicy and fresh and amazing. Beans and rice are fine, nothing bad or spectacular. They are not open late, I think they close at 6 and are not open Sundays. The neighborhood is rundown and crappy but this place attracts all kinds of people from business to casual because the food is just that good. Oh and it's really cheap.

Wow what a hidden gem this place is!!! Stopped in with my mom and sister. I ordered a bean tostada, pastor street taco and some chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. Beans were creamy, salsa was a fresh pico de gallo, chips were crispy, and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice. My mom ordered the steak fajitas and they were well worth the wait. The meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned. The rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that I loved. My sister had a veggie street taco which I had a bite of and it was surprisingly good. It was beans, peppers, onions, potatoes and avocado. The only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty. However the food and quick service was outstanding. I will definitely be back.

I went here yesterday and had a blast! Yes, I'm 22 years old, but hey acting like a kid is fun. LOTS of games, surely you'll find at least a few you'll enjoy. I went here on a date and it was a great choice. Spend $20, get a 100 credits. Games average 2-4 credits, some of the really great ones are 8-12 credits. Have shooting games, fighting games, racing games, music games, dancing games, and lots of other games. Love love loved it. Spent 2 hours there and didn't even notice. Laughed, yelled, cussed, and smiled. You get really into some of the games :-) Anyway, overall great.

I can't help but give this place 5 stars. The food is always great. I love their chips and salsa, some of the best I've ever had. I love their shredded beef tacos, their green chili con carne burrito, and their taco salads. It's affordable, casual mexican food. Very easy to make this place a regular restaurant to eat at.

This place is DE-LISH. I love Chinese food, but have a hard time finding a place where the food is good. It's a small, strip mall place. I've had the lemon chicken combination meal and it was fantastic. Perfectly crisp chicken with a light, tangy lemon sauce. The egg rolls are the biggest I've ever seen and are yummy. Their lo mein was good too. Only draw back is I won't eat in, it's next to a nail salon and smells like one. This is a great take out place though.

This place is great whether you like sushi or not. I am not a fish eater, but my boyfriend is. I always order their chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of it is always excellent. My boyfriend orders the California roll (either regular or tempura coated), the spicy tuna roll, and many others. He says it's very good as well. The service is always great and the atmosphere is nice. It's a small place, maybe 15 tables plus the sushi bar. It's not fancy, but it's a nice weekly dining experience that's affordable and great food. Be advised though, they do close from 3-5pm to prepare for dinner service.

Five stars is not something that happens often. However we had a great date night here. Sitting at the teppanaki table we got jokes, showmanship, and amazing food. Real deal. Delicious fresh food and wonderful chef.

Bowled here yesterday, loved it. Place was clean, and even though we went at like 1pm, they had music going and colored lights. Similar to cosmic bowling, just they still had the main lights on. Bowling balls were in good shape and well made, some of the crappy ones will hurt your fingers within a short time, but these didn't. I had a coupon, but right now they have a pretty good $15 two hour unlimited play with shoe rental and soda per person which is CHEAP for bowling. Great place for a date or for kids or friends, really anybody.

First off I would like to say they really shouldn't advertise a gluten free menu. When I asked for their gluten free menu, I was handed a card about the size of an index card with about 4-5 items on it. I decided on their chopped chicken salad aftrr not seeing anything else appealing out of the small amount of choices. When the salad came out the greens were wilted, there may have been 1/3 cup of chicken on top and it just looked sad. I asked for a refund and left. I won't be returning. If thats all you're offering for gluten free, just skip it and definitely don't serve sad looking food like that. It looked like something McDonald's would put out.

Went here with a large party for a celebration dinner. Servers accomodated everyone with ease and promptness. I ordered the New York Strip medium with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I loved all of it. Normally steak is just steak, however this steak was juicy and nicely grilled on the outside. I loved the fried zucchni as an appetizer and the dessert was good as well. Nice time.

All I ever eat here is their chicken fajitas. I love them so much that I can't bring myself  to order anything else. They come with fresh, homemade tortillas, creamy beans, flavorful rice, guacomole, and sour cream. This is one meal that you can share with another person and both of you get full. Their chips and salsa are some of the best as well. The service varies. I've had ok service and I've had excellent. I've eaten here probably about 40 times and only have had bad service maybe 3 times. Food is ALWAYS excellent. The manager there is happy to fix anything and check up on all customers periodically.

Ohhhhhh Chevy's how I love you. Their chicken fajita salad is one of my favorite salads anywhere. Crispy greens, grilled chicken, pepita seeds, avocado, salsa...yes please. Chevy's also likes to do a fruit of the month where they will make lemonades and margarita's using this fresh fruit puree. I had a cantalope lemonade, and let me say, one of the most refreshing delicious drinks EVER! I've also had their watermelon lemonade and mango lemonade, also great. Their chips and salsa are always great as well. The only so-so occasionally is the service.

Let me say the food tasted and looked great. However, beware that they use MSG in their food. If you have no sensitivity to MSG, then enjoy. However immediately after eating the food both my mom and I had horrible headaches, dizziness, and some numbness in the tongue (all documented side effects of MSG). I'm disappointed as I really wanted to have a decent Asian place on this far North side of town, but I cannot handle their food. Also, the place really needs a thorough cleaning, I understand casual atmosphere, but food crusted on the wall next to you or stains on the booths are not "casual" they are dirty.

I am surprised too that I am giving a 5 star rating. However, this place deserves it. This location in particular just wow-ed me. Both employees that I met where extremely nice and had outstanding customer service skills. It shocked me and I was pleasantly surprised. They kept addressing me by first name after I told them my name, nice touch. They made my order exactly the way I wanted it and verified my specifications to be sure I got what I wanted. The food was good, fresh, and I got exactly what I paid for. I had a salad with grilled chicken, pico de gallo, cheese, guacomole, romaine lettuce, and pinto beans. YUM!!! Plus more low-cal than most other fast foodie type choices. Overall great experience, I will definitely be going back.

OMG, I just went there to get a few little sweet treats. So much to choose from!!! I ended up with a wedding cookie, an apricot Klinche(sp?), an eclair, a cream puff, and a mini new york cheese cake. When I walked up there was a customer outside eating a huge italian sub, it looked delicious. Walking in, it's set up like a bakery, shelves behind glass full of a million different cookies, pastries, pies, cakes. The wedding cookie, perfect. The most fresh, soft, crumbly wedding cookie ever. The apricot one, don't know if I spelled it right, was yum! It was dusted in powdered sugar, filled with an apricot jam. The eclair, I just got the little one, it's enough, trust me! It's very rich, the chocolate icing on top is thick and rich. The custard filling was thick and creamy. Never liked eclairs much until now. Cream puff was good. Same custard inside as eclair, but didn't have the same "umph" as the eclair. It was dusted in powdered sugar, didn't care for that mixed with custard. Overall fantastic. Try it.

I love this place. It's beautifully decorated and the service is excellent. I have been here a few times and each time was consistently great. They are more one the "fine" mexican cuisine scale. They make an avocado mousse, that's like guacamole, only better. It's silky and creamy and oh so delicious. Their queso dip was excellent as well. Try their dip sampler it has the two I listed and one other. I've had a taco plate here and a quesodilla, both excellent.

This is definitely a sport's bar. Laid back atmosphere, nice waitstaff. TVs everywhere with all kinds of sports on. I have a buy one get one free dinner coupon from dine4az.com. Waitress was happy about it, didn't get all rude like waitresses usually do when handed a coupon. My boyfriend got spaghetti and meatballs, I had lasagna. The portions were HUGE. You could easily share a dinner with someone. The lasagna was average, not great, not bad. I tried a piece of the meatball, it was very good. I would've rather had that. Meatball was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Overall good experience. I heard they were known for their pizza and wings, so next time I will be trying that.

I enjoy this place from time to time. The chicken is always fresh tasting and their avocado salsa is my favorite. I like to stop in for a grilled chicken breast with a loco side salad or their new chicken tacos. Best choice for fast food.

The four stars is for the education. For the price, I would say 2 stars. It's expensive to go here. However, I did feel that I received a top notch education for my paralegal associate degree program. I graduated in October 2008, attended from January of 2007-Oct 2008. All my teachers were more than knowledgable on the subject they were teaching. Very helpful and had good insight as to how what they were teaching really applies in the field. All my law teachers were either seasoned lawyers or judges. Lots of gray areas in law, so having someone teach you what's in the book, plus how it really happens in real life is priceless.

Only reason they don't get 5 stars is their salsa bar. It always disappoints and even sometimes disgusts me. Their salsas tend to taste like they've been sitting way too long, not fresh at all. Also some have a sour taste like it's spoiled. However, that being said, their menu is delish! I love their Salpicon salad, it's amazing. It is a mixture of chopped radishes, cucumber, green leaf lettuce, cojita, guacamole, sour cream, and meat on top of a tostada shell with beans on it. I could eat this every day, it's just that good. It tastes so light and fresh. I also enjoy their beans, tacos, quesadillas, and burritos. They make a huge quesadilla with cheese, meat, and guacamole thats crispy and savory.

Went here this morning around 10 am. There was like a 20 minute wait, but no biggie. Service was fast, orders were fresh and correct, and place was clean. It is the Waffle House, not a fancy joint. So for what it is, it was good. Plus the staff are all very easy going and create a fun lively atmosphere. Good for a casual breakfast.

I went here once a few years ago and then again about two months ago. YUCK! They're expensive and the food is gross! They're fried rice is bland and dry. Lemon chicken sauce was gummy, so was the sweet & sour pork. Soup was bland and nasty smelling. I don't know what people like about this place, maybe they've never had good Chinese food and think this is what it's supposed to taste like. Go up the street to 43rd and Cactus and get Chung Ming, then you will know what REAL Chinese food is supposed to taste like.

My uncle ordered one of their party subs for the Super Bowl. It was their italian sub, with capicolla, salami, ham, pepperoni, and provelone. It was FANTASTIC! I am a sucker for italian subs, but picky when it comes to the quality. This was perfect. I will definitely be going there myself to see what their other dishes tastes like.

I dont usually 5 star a place, but they deserve it. Came here for the first time tonight because I had a coupon. No issues using the coupon either which is nice. I ordered the garlic cream enchiladas and they were very creamy and flavorful. The filling was dark meat chicken with some pinto beans which I thought was a nice surprise. Their refried beans were so delicious, they were fresh and slightly soupy which I love. Rice was a little spicy, and cooked well. I also ordered the guacamole appetizer which I requested with no tomato and they accommodated. They put queso fresco on their quac which was a nice addition. We eneded our meal with sopapillas which were rich and sweet, everything you'd want them to be. Customer service was quick and polite. All in all it was a winning experience and I will definitely be back. They are tops for Mexican food in Phoenix.

It's a sports bar, so it's loud, a zillion tvs, and a little dark. However, the food was that of restaurant quality. Had a meatball and tomato pizza with medium wings. Pizza was fresh, crispy crust, and the meatballs were yum! The wings were crispy and tasted like fresh chicken. Could've used a little more sauce, but I'm not complaining. I will definitely be going back for the delicious food.

I went there last night for their monthly open house. Let me just say, if you are looking to get married or even hold a bridal/baby shower, this is THE place. I am just starting to plan my wedding and I was lucky enough to stumble across this place online. It's reasonably priced which is UNHEARD of in the wedding industry. We pulled up, parked on the street because I did not notice they had a lot behind them until later. Most of their preferred vendors were there. Loved the bartending service, Hey Bartender LLC. Owner, Chad was there. He is very personable without being annoying which is rare for a bartender. Met with Truffle Trolley, YUM! Their cakes and truffles are delish, will be booking them. Toured Virginia's House, it's very old circa 1913 (there's a sign out front). It's quaint, has that "old house" smell. Only a few minor blemishes on the inside, but I'm sure they'll be fixed soon. The outside is the main event anyway. Their garden is beautiful, perfect for any intimate wedding. Lots of greenery and a small gazebo. They also have a back house where they tend to serve food during events, perfectly sized and placed. Natalie, one of the coordinator's is amazing. She is very nice (not the fake sales nice) and is extremely accomodating. You can tell that she takes pride in her work and is truly there for the people. I am very excited to work one on one with her to plan my wedding. We spoke briefly last night about some rough estimates and it was definitely what I want.

I went here for their Mother's Day Brunch last year May 2009 and it was great. There scones were the best I've ever had. With them, they brought lemon curd, an apple spread, and devonshire cream. The lemon curd was to die for. They were white chocolate and fabulous. They brought us out a 3 tiered platter that had little sandwiches, scones, and desserts on it. We also had a salad appetizer that had strawberries in it, I was skeptical, as I do not eat fruit in regular salad. It was very good. The tea was delicious peach, not from a tea bag. The china we ate off of and drank from was beautiful and delicate. The place is a tea room after all, so it has cottage, country style decor with lots of trinkets, most of which are for sale. I loved it. We had great, personal service and a memorable experience.

I love Carumbas! Is it fancy? No. Is it a restaurant? Not quite (it's a walk up to the counter and order, pay, then go get your food when it's ready). Is it delicious? YES. I love love their stuffed quesadilla and their pico di gallo is always yummy. Their burritos are pretty good too.

Still one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food. We order out regularly from here. It's cheap and always good. Their new carnitas tacos are by far my favorite thing. The meat is so juicy and has a great flavor. My boyfriend almost always orders the red beef enchiladas and I can't blame him because they're that good. For a good cheap meal, this is the place.

I prefer the shredded beef way over the chicken, let me say. Theyre tacos, taco salads, and beans are just so good. The taco salad is ginormous, definitely a share item. Its loaded with beans, meat, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce. I absolutely love it. Their salsa is quite good, especially with their fresh chips. The servers here all assist with every table, so you will never wait long for anything. There is always someone coming by checking on you and giving you what you need, which is not common. It's a little dark and very dated in here, but the food is good and decently priced for the large portions.

I have to disagree that Denny's is similar to this place. I have been here twice for breakfast and it was yummy both times. A lot more "homey" feeling than a commerical Dennys. Staff is always nice, always there to give you something before you ask for it. Buttermilk biscuits are yum, eggs perfect, potatoes are good. Prices are cheap!

Soooooooo I used to go to this place was I was a small child and just went there for the first time in about....7-9 years last night. OMG YUM! I love love love their food. I ordered a dinner special (there's 4) and they give you sooooooo much food for $7-8. I got the sesame chicken, fried rice, chicken lo mein, crab puff, and egg roll plate. It also came with egg drop soup. I LOVE egg drop soup, but most places don't make it good. They made some of the best I've ever had. Next time I go, I am just ordering a big bowl of that. Anyway, I had to pay an extra $1.50 because I substituted the sesame chicken for the teryiaki chicken. No biggie, it was still a steal! My BF got the sweet and sour pork with fried shrimp and lo mein and fried rice. He loved it too. He said their hot mustard was the hottest he's ever had.......and then ran a train on it :o) Only thing I didn't like was the bathroom. But hey, who rates a restaurant on that?? It just stunk and was also used as a storage closet. Anyway, if you're out this way, stop in. You'll get amazing food for an unbelievably low price. No wonder they've been in business for 15-20 years.

Been coming here since I was a small child, it's a family tradition. I am a HUGE fan of their pupu platter and their sizzling rice soup. The pupu platter has wings, beef skewers, egg rolls, crab puffs, and won tons. The beef skewers are my favorite, always crispy and a little salty goodness. The sizzling rice soup is out of this world. The broth itself is a complexity of flavors that burst in your mouth. The rice is crispy yet soft, there is everything in this soup, from tofu to shrimp to veggies. Order it and prepare for an experience from the moment the rice gets dropped in and the sizzle starts. The rest of their menu is a hit and a miss. Just depends on what you like. Decor is extremely divey and dated, but the food is worth it.

I went there last night for Happy Hour (which is available in their lounge section). Let me say the food was WOW. I kept hearing about this place's food and finally decided to go try it myself. My boyfriend and I were surprised how dead the lounge was, as we both have been there on Friday and Saturday nights and the place is packed. Anyway, they offer 1/2 price appetizers from 4-8 Tuesday-Friday. We ordered their Jumbo Wings, asked if they come with a medium sauce, waitress said no. So I asked for sauce on the side, as I don't like very spicy food. Also ordered a brisket quesadilla and beer fries. The wings were very big, all drumsticks. Perfectly fried, very meaty, and their wing sauce is not too spicy, it was delicious. Perfect wing sauce I say, not too thick or thin, full of flavor, with a little kick. Excellent. The brisket quesadilla was huge, very meaty, and the meat inside was perfectly tender. The beer fries, oh the fries! The waitress told me about them, they are not on the menu, you have to ask for them. They were the best I've ever had. For fries, you don't expect much. They're fries for God's sake, but these fries are something to talk about. Crisp, flavorful, salty with a little sweet. Definitely a must try! I'm excited to actually go eat in the restaurant section next time! DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place was just like described. I can say that the owner could be offensive to you if you chose to take him that way. He's very outspoken and enthusiastic. I liked him, but I can see that some people wouldn't. Anyway, the only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because when we first walked in we just stood there. No one greeted us, a waitress walked by, made eye contact with me and didn't say anything. She could've at least acknowledged that I was standing there and said someone would be right with us. Anyway, we finally got seated and ordered. We had the calamari appetizer. I hate seafood, but this was really good. It was fresh calamari sauteed in garlic, lemon, and olive oil. Very fresh tasting and didn't taste fishy at all. It came with a side of homemade marinara sauce. The sauce was AMAZING. I will be going back to try the pasta since the sauce was THAT great. We then ordered two classic gyros (only $7 each). I've never had one before, so this was interesting. It was huge, lots of lamb meat, perfectly cooked. It wasn't greasy or anything like others have said gyros can be. It came with a big side of greek salad. Didn't care for the sauce that came with the gyro, so I asked for more of the delicious marinara and dipped my gyro in that. Overall nice dining experience. Place was very clean and decorated with greek things and played greek music. I will definitely be going back.

I love this place, I have for a long time. Even now with my dietary restrictions they still have decent choices. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas with no dairy items and no peppers. It was still amazing, the chicken was juicy and spiced just right and the onions....ohhh how I love perfectly carmelized onions. I didnt even want the tortillas, it didn't need it. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The beans could've been a little creamier and fresh tasting, while they weren't horrible, they weren't great. All in all it was a great lunch with plenty to take home. I will definitely be back.

I love this place and go there frequently. Their personal pizza's are my favorite item! I love to get pepperoni and tomato on mine. The crust is...phenomenal and this is coming from someone who is not a crust fan. I also love their minestrone soup and garlic bread. Apparently the service is different for everyone, but I always have really awesome service. Always friendly, they remember our order, and are very personable.

This place never ceases to amaze me with their delicious food. Yes it sucks they are closed on Sundays, however I make sure to get in there some other day for sure. I've loved everything I've had, lemon chicken, orange chicken, mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, crab puffs, fried rice, and chicken lo mein. Can't go wrong in this place, at least not that I've experienced. It is very small and dated, but the food will impress. The prices are also cheap for the amount of food and quality of everything on the plate. Lemon chicken is my favorite thing, the sauce is a light sweet coating on the well fried chicken.

If you are looking for the coolest one of a kind things for your home and garden, this is THE place. I was expecting some smelly old run down thrift shop and this place was not that at all!! It was crowded with amazing things everywhere I looked. This place has everything from chandeliers to wall hangings to stone statues to metal art made from recycled items. I was truly blown away with the amount of interesting, beautiful, and electic things in this store. I will definitely be going back. This is not a cheapy thrift store, so don't expect any 3 for a $1.00 bins. Things are reasonably priced considering the quality and uniqueness of the items.

This location is nothing like the 35th Ave and Bell location, thank God! I ordered the carne asada tacos, one chicken, one steak. Oh my were they fabulous. Both meats were cooked perfectly tender and seasoned. Tortillas were fresh and soft. Beans and rice were a great side, as they each had good flavor. The chips and salsa here are addictive and yummy. Very fresh and flavorful. Service was good and it was extremely busy so brownie points.

What a menu! My boyfriend loves sushi and I don't eat seafood, so going to these types of restaurants can be quite disappointing. However this place has the most extensive menu I've seen at a Japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar. The ambiance in the place is really romantic at night with dim lighting, nice music, and delicate plating. All the little details in the decor, like placing the chopsticks on a polished river rock was beautiful. Their menu offered everything from chicken and beef to lots of seafood. I ordered chicken teriyaki and it was delish. Their sauce tasted homemade and was lighter then most which I loved. It came plated nicely. I also had their tempura which was light and airy as it should be. The dipping sauce, also heavenly. My man seemed to enjoy his sushi and it looked nice as well. Overall it's pricey compared to other sushi places, however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it.

I just went here last Saturday night and had a great time. You can't expect clubs to be 100% perfect, they are usually crowded and that causes problems. However, we arrived around 10:30 pm and the music was great, dancing was so much fun. I liked that they kept the bar area really cool, it was nice to go take a break after sweating up a storm while dancing. Nice looking people, the only thing I didn't like was the bartending girls at the front bar constantly asking me, "Beer, shot?" every single time they saw me. I said no the first time, listen.

Stopped by today for a few treats. I had a gluten free dark chocolate walnut cookie and also a gluten free german chocolate donut. The cookie was good, but that donut was DELISH! Ive been gluten free for a couple of years and have had my share of gluten free baked goods which can be dense and gross. But that donut was rich and cakey with just the right amount of chocolate flavor. My boyfriend had the regular german chocolate cupcake and said it was one of the best cupcakes hes ever had. I'll definitely be back.

I love this location and the other one on 66th and Bell. This one tends to have friendly service and more attentive wait staff. Food is always great, portions always big, can't go wrong with this place.

Ate here today and about a month ago. Both times yummy. Customer service is a 2-3 stars. But, whatever. I lovvvvvvvvvvvvve their fresh toppings here. They have just the right mixture of lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Last time I got a bean tostada and chicken taco plate. Delish. Today, I had the chicken salad in a bowl (normally comes in a tortilla shell). It was so good! It was lots of lettuce with grilled cubed chicken, topped with refried beans, cheese, olives, tomatoes, and green onions. It was really refreshing and fresh. Again, the customer service could be A LOT better, but so far the food has made me want to come back anyway.

This place is one of my favorite Chinese places. The servers and bussers always greet you and are attentive to you. Their Chicken  & Broccoli is the best ever. Always perfectly tender in a light white sauce that's creamy and flavorful. I also like their moo goo gui pan and their chicken lo mein. Their combination lunches and dinners are great. You get soup, egg roll, and crab puff, with fried rice and your main dish for cheap.

We love this place. It recently got moved a building over, into a waaaay bigger suite. It's about 5 times the size it used to be. It's now located in the same parking lot as Great Skate. Anyway, this is our dive bar hangout. This is a place to go on the weekend nights with your friends to hang out, have some drinks, sing some karaoke, play darts or pool, and have a good time. Food is medicore bar food, wish it was a little better. But hey, we don't come here for the food anyway, we come to hang out.

The garlic parmasian wings are my favorite. I'm allergic to certain spicy foods, so being able to order wings that taste good with options other than hot sauce is awesome. Take out is always quick and correctly done. Will continue to order in from there.

Make the BEST ribs I've ever had. Order a full rack with mashed potatoes. You'll be in heaven. This place and Bobby Q's are pretty close in my book with good BBQ. Those are actually the only two places I consider even remotely "good" for BBQ. It's harder to find than it should be. Anyway, this is not really a restaurant. It's a order at the counter, they bring your food, and that's it kind of place. Their sweet tea is THE BEST! Their ribs are always fall off the bone tender, meaty, and just the right amount of sauce. Their mashed potatoes are amazing, I don't know how they make them, but Yum! The West Gate location is not good at all. If you want good Shane's you gotta go to this one.

I went here to get my nails done about a year ago and they were completely rude to me and my nail technician cut me several times with her drill. She also drilled my real nails down so bad that I have dents in a couple of my nails that have never healed. Go up the street to Royal Tuyet Nails by Albertsons. Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better.

Only thing good about this place was our waiter. The food was bland! I cook better at home, seriously. I had the grilled chicken entree with steamed broccoli and western rice. The chicken had NO flavor. They could at least put a spice rub or something on it. Just throwing plain chicken on a grill and serving it is not worth $14.99. The broccoli was ok and the rice tasted like nothing. They didn't put anything on the rice either. It just tasted like plain boiled rice. I asked to get a different side, he brought out garlic mashed potatoes. Tasted like instant mashed potatoes with no garlic flavor at all. So, the food was crappy and the price was way too high for the low quality. No thanks, won't be going back.

If I want to get my nails done or a pedicure this is THE place. I have been here about.....15-20 times. Never have I had a bad experience. Everyone always greets you, is friendly, and gives you exactly what you want. They're prices are pretty average nail salon prices, $20 for a spa pedicure (you sit in a big massage chair with jet spa foot tub, get heels scrubbed, nails & cuticals trimmed, full foot and calf massage, and nails painted). I think it's $20-25 for regular white tip acrylic nails. They do a fantastic job on that too. Go here, I know you won't be disappointed.

Been a regular here for years. Love coming here for my pedicures. Lisa is my go to pedicure lady because she does such a wonderful job and gives amazing foot and calf massages. Place is always clean and accommodating. They do tend to get busy on the weekends, so you might wait a bit to get in. I recommend calling a day or two ahead to just make an appointment, much shorter wait time. I used to get acrylics and they'd last forever just like the pedicures do. I moved downtown and ill still drive across town to this place because no place compares.

This place makes excellent shredded beef (machca) tacos. The meat is tender and so flavorful. I've been here quite a few times and was never disappointed.

Filly Bs. I LOVE this place. This location is particularly good. I love their taco tuedays, something about their chicken tacos is just good. I love their carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, and their bean burritos. If you want cheap, big portions of good Mexican food, Filly Bs is it. It's not by any means fine dining or a "restaurant", but it's a good quick stop place.

I am a hot wing fan and this place has some pretty awesome ones. They're always meaty and crispy. Sometimes they need more sauce, as I like them saucey, but the waitress will easily comply with that request. Their individual pizzas are very good, they have lots of topping choices and they have good crust. Reasonably priced and great for a loud night out with friends.

I love this place. They're breakfasts are great! They make the best buttermilk biscuits I've ever had. I had their california omlet, it was fantastic and huge. Prices are resonable too. I've always had great food here, burgers, sandwiches, taco salads..........only thing I didn't like was their chili. It's extremely spicy. I love the decor in there too, makes you feel like you're on vacation in the mountains.

My God do I love this place. I have a craving just for this place. I am addicted to their chicken gyros. The pita bread is always fresh and soft, the chicken always thinly sliced and succulent, and theres always plenty of fresh lettuce and tomato on there. I add feta to mine, as whats a gyro without that. Also, their Greek salad....the dressing is the best I've ever had. They boast homemade dressing and they really do make it good. Very light and fresh, slightly tangy. Just be sure to ask for it on the side...unless you like a heavily dressed salad, which I do not. Plus they give quality salad ingredients, like green leaf lettuce, big juicy tomatoes, feta, fresh bell peppers, and kalmata olives in the salads. They don't skimp like most places. Decor is very casual, nothing special. But try it once and you'll be back.

Oh my Jesus, this place...if you have not been, GO! You will not be disappointed. I crave this place, it's THAT good. Their chicken gyros, are amaz-zzzing. Baklava? Homemade delicious sweetness. And their Greek salad is exactly how a Greek salad should be. I can't stop taking everyone I know here...

This place is ridic!!!!! I crave this place because it's that amazing. LOVE the chicken gyro. I do not eat lamb, but love gyros. So the fact that they have chicken gyro meat is awesome. A lot of other gyro places do not have chicken gyros, so kudos to them. The meat is always so flavorful and moist, just melts in your mouth. And their taziki sauce is by far the best out of all the places in the valley. Its always so light and creamy, with just the right amount of cucumber and dill. I always get extra to use as dipping sauce because I can't get enough. The portions are also some of the biggest out of all the other gyro places. I also love their fresh crisp Greek salad with their homemade Greek dressing. All in all this place is the best.

Happened to be in North Scottsdale a few week so ago and stopped in with my mom and sister. It was delicious. Had a chicken gyro with fries, taziki sauce was so good I bought extra to dip the fries in. The fries were surprisingly good, extra crispy like they were double fried or something. The chicken gyro was just the right size and meat was tender and delish. Unfortunately I don't go in the area much, but if I do I'll be stopping in for lunch for sure.

My review is for the regular menu, not the sushi. I go along with my sushi loving boyfriend to sushi bars frequently so I've had my share of "other menu items" at these places. I ordered the teriyaki chicken, it was dry and the sauce was too strong with soy sauce flavor. I ordered green tea and when it came it was separating in the glass and had stuff floating in it. That was an absolute no go. The decor is a dive, which I am normally willing to overlook if the food is good. My boyfriend does love the sushi here and has been going here a long time. So if you're solely in it for sushi, go for it. Otherwise go elsewhere.

The other location off I-17 & Happy Valley is WAY better. This one was blah. I had ribs, they were ok. They were out of mashed potatoes......If you want better service and better quality go to the other location.

The ambiance in this place alone is so romantic and upscale. It's hard not to feel a little sexy when you go here. I've had a filet mignon, asparagus, potatoes, and cheesecake. The steak melts in your mouth the way only perfectly cut and cooked top of the line beef would. Asparagus was tender and flavorful and the potatoes where creamy and fluffy. The cheesecake was just that, cheesecake, nothing spectacular or memorable about it. All in all I love this place, it's the ideal place for celebrations or a special night out.

Ahhh the Yard House, its good for a date or for family. Been here for both many times and loved it. Their menu is quite diverse, usually offering something for everyone. I love their chicken nachos, being someone who hates nachos, that says a lot. There is no liquid cheese involved! It's a heap of grilled chicken, beans, sour cream, guacamole, fresh shredded cheese that's melted, on chips. I also love their turkey club. The bread is perfectly toasted, turkey is juicy, bacon is crispy, and avacado is creamy. Their garlic parmesan fries are to die for. I did not care too much for their pizza though, had the margarita and I've had better. Service is always good and the ambiance is nice.

Our boy Nash had a horrible swollen eye and infected ear, so we wanted to find a vet close by to be our regular vet since he didn't have one yet. We adopted him about 4 months ago from the Humane Society, golden retriever/border collie mix. I called this morning asking if they could please fit me in this morning, as I was very worried about him. I told them I didn't mind waiting, I just needed to have him seen this morning. They said sure to come on by and they would try and fit me in soon, which most places would not allow. Very happy, I took Nash down there. Office was clean and office members were friendly. I waited about 10 minutes, no more than I feel like I would've waited had I made an appointment. The vet assistant was wonderful and helpful. The vet, Ms. Ruiz was also very friendly and informative. I did not feel pressured or oversold on anything like some vet offices do. They also took time to examine him properly and do sufficient testing to ensure they knew what the problem was and if there was an underlying reason. I was very pleased with the level of professional service as well as the reasonable prices. This will definitely be Nash's regular vet office from now on.

This is the BEST location in the West Valley. Arrowhead is always too packed and the Metro Center location never makes the food the same. They always get me in quickly and the food is consistantly good. I order knowing I can expect quality. I am a big $6.95 unlimited soup and salad fan.

I went here about 2 months ago and it was FANTASTIC. If you, like me (before I went here) was like what the hell is a pasty? Go in and find out. It's like an English (or British I don't remember) old traditional food that wives of coal miners used to make since it was easy to eat out on the job (the history is on the menu). It's similar to a calzone, except the dough is more of a fluffy, flakey pastry consistancy. I had their italian one and I was wow-ed. It had italian deli meats in it with cheese and their marinara is to DIE for. I asked the cook after tasting it if it was homemade and he said that it was. They have all kinds of fillings, surely at least one that you would enjoy. It is a very small place, only like 10 tables plus the bar. I like sitting at the bar, you can watch them make everything right in front of you.

The food here is quite good and original. HOWEVER the incredibly horrible service was impossible to overlook. We came in and sat at the bar for a good, 10 minutes until I finally asked the cook behind the bar if he could take our order. He said yeah sure, wrote it down and put it somewhere. About 30 minutes later I decide to check, walk over and ask the waitress if she can check on our food. She asks the cook, he said he never got anything. The cook says well I gave the other cook the order. So we wait another 20 minutes for our forgotten food. After eating, plates sit empty, still no waitress, so I walk over to one and tell her we need our bill. This was so utterly disappointing.

Sigh, I eating a meal and then thinking to myself why do I have to pay for this crap. I could've done it better in my own kitchen. I had a 1/2 Chicken Pomodori Panini with a side salad, a tea, and a pecan cinnamon rugelach. Sandwich had roasted chicken that was rubbery and the bread didn't taste like anything. Side salad, tomatoes way too ripe, should have been thrown out not served and croutons were soggy. The tea was thick tasting, like there was too much tea and not enough water. The rugelach was actually decent, crispy and sweet. And it's a BIG downer when you see an employee walk over to the food station, grab a pickle with his bare hands and start crunching away on it. This place was an overall disappointment. I have eaten here before, so I should have known better.

The grilled chicken sandwich here has me almost aroused. It's two slices of the most amazing sourdough bread that's been toasted to perfection, with a succulent grilled chicken breast, under lettuce, tomato, and mustard. A bite of this sandwich feels like sheer perfection in my mouth. The bread alone had me asking them where it comes from, it's a local bakery, go figure. It comes with a side of fries and they are nice and crispy. The decor is very blue....but I like to sit outside anyway.

Ok, so I just ate lunch here (like 10 minutes ago :o)) Anyway, it was pretty good. Someone from there was marketing and came into my work with a free lunch voucher, so I figured I'd try it out. So, I go in, atmosphere is relaxed, decor is island-ish, nice new establishment. I really like the muraled walls. When I gave the waitress my voucher she had that annoyed attitude. Here's my thought, the free voucher is to get me in, try the food, and want to come back. If the service is poor, then you just lost business and the free meal was a waste. ANYWAY, I ordered the boneless wing platter (wings and fries and another side). It's $9.99. I'd say the price fits what you get. I got 10 boneless wings in the sauce of my choice with fries. I wanted a salad with my platter instead of coleslaw, she said there's a charge. Salad was big for a side salad and it was good. You can sample wing sauces before picking one, I ended up with the medium hurricane sauce, the normal hot wing sauce. I loved it. It had good flavor and went nicely with fries. I'd say this is definitely the beer and wing joint, the menu is just appetizers, wings, and sandwiches and they have a full bar. One disappointment is that their happy hour food deals are not great.

I had high hopes for this place. However when I am trying to order and the cook's son is behind the counter screaming at him to pay attention to him, throwing a fit, pulling on his dads clothes and yelling, I don't really want to spend anymore time in the place. However I was starving, so I ordered anyway. Had a chicken gyro, it was skimpy. Been to places that offer a lot more for your money. Then while eating the child continued to scream and the mother made some weak attempts to tell him to be quiet. My advice is hire a babysitter or stay home with the kid, this isn't a daycare, it's a food establishment. You'll lose money.

I've become a little obsessed with this place. I cannot get enough of their chicken gyro. Meat has great flavor and is almost moist. Their taziki sauce is so good I actually ask for extra and put it on everything. It's so fresh tasting with the dill and cucumber. I stop by anytime I'm in the central Glendale area. The only thing that I didn't like was that I had recently bought an online coupon and when I came to use it they didn't seem too sure how to apply it. It took awhile but eventually they got it figured out. I'll be back there soon I'm sure.

I went to this location for my birthday last year. It was amazing. I had a great therapist! I had never had a professional massage before. This was a great experience. The building is nice and new, decorated nicely. Undressing felt akward, but honestly my massage therapist was amazing at making me feel comforable. During the massage, nothing became "overexposed", she knew just how to cover and uncover perfectly. This was an extremely relaxing, wonderful experience. This is definitely a nice way to relax. What I love too, is that they will call you when you haven't been in in awhile and offer you a special. I'm going next weekend thanks to one of their calls!!!!

First off I am a huge fan of refried beans, this place has some of the most velvety, delicious refried beans I've ever had anywhere. Not too salty, homemade, creamy, just perfect. I am a fan of their pastor. Before eating here I did not know what that was, it's a marinated pork in a sweet robust red sauce that is served with grilled pineapple. It's island-y tasting. Portions here are on the smaller side, however the food is so tasty, I'm not complaining.

Came here tonight because my dog was having some serious problems eating and breathing. Called ahead, office said they could fit us in right away. Girls were friendly and efficient. Vet was wonderful and explained everything. My dog felt comfortable and got immediate treatment. Ended up having a salivary gland infection. Prices were also reasonable. Would go back without hesitation.

I went here two Saturdays ago and I LOVED it. Lien was my nail tech and OMG I was wow-ed. I got a manicure (even though I have hardly any nails) and a pedicure. I was in heaven for almost 2 hours. Manicure was $10 and basic pedicure was $20. My pedicure also included a neck/shoulder massage. The way she massaged my hands, feet, legs, neck, and shoulders was well worth the price. I felt amazing. She didn't cut me or do a messy job. It was almost perfect. Only things I didn't like were: the massage chairs had weird massage cycles, I've had better massage chairs; they didn't have complimentary refreshments (like bottled water or cookies). But hey, I love this place anyway.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. If you enjoy girlie girl things, this is THE place. Yes, I know I'm not 6 anymore, so playing dress up isn't something I really get to do anymore. However, this place allows adult women to feel dainty and girlie with all the amazing little things in here. Lots of little pretty headbands, barrettes, jewlery, clothing......Feels artsy in here in a good way. Just a fun place to come into. Plus the prices are SOOOOOOOOO reasonable. In a place like this, you would expect boutique pricing, but when feminine feather headbands are $9.00 and dainty floral dresses are $30.00, how can you not be excited???

Came here one night after a Coyote's game, I was pleasantly surprised. I had a stromboli and it was fantastic. The dough was chewy and crispy (now THAT'S skill) and had been brushed with herbs and butter. The filling was meaty and cheesy. I stuffed the entire thing in my stomach even after I was full because it was THAT good. Service was decent.

Would've been 5 stars had the service been a little faster. I believe we waited about 40-50 minutes for our entrees. However I was very impressed by their selection of gluten free items. I was even more impressed how they tasted, as anyone whose had gluten free bread products knows it can be a hit or a miss. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza gluten free with an olive oil base since I'm allergic to tomatoes. It was wonderful. Chicken was juicy, pesto tasted fresh, cheese was nice and chewy and not overly greasy. The gluten free crust was flaky and similar to a biscuit,  which was amazing compared to the other gluten free pizza doughs I've had that taste like cardboard. I also ordered the gluten free garlic cheesy bread, as I couldn't remember the last time I've gotten to have garlic bread since I'm gluten free. It was amazing, chewy and buttery and everything I'd want it to be. I will definitely be back since the food was wonderful and hopefully the service will be a little more prompt.

First time at this place friday night. Loved the atmosphere, very classic candy shop. They had a big selection of childhood favorite candies. So on to the ice cream, fantastic. Creamy and homemade tasting. I had a strawberry shortcake sundae. Only thing i wish was different was the shortcake, as they used cookies instead. Good sized portions. Ill be going back.

Stopped in here today for lunch with my boyfriend. I ordered the chicken kebab meal and he ordered a traditional gyro meal. The counter person offered us complimentary soup while we wait, so I had the lentil soup. The soup had nice spice and well cooked green lentils. My chicken kebabs we're AMAZING! They we're very juicy and had delicious seasoning. The rice with the meal was perfectly cooked and nicely spiced. The salad was fresh, although the dressing wasn't my favorite. I sampled my boyfriend's gyro, the meat had a nice oregano flavor and was tender. The pita bread tasted homemade, which is not too common and tastes so much better than premade. They also give pita bread with a garlic dip with meals which I thought was a nice touch. We will definitely be back!

My car hadn't been washed in several months and with the black paint, it was looking pretty horrible. I had never been here before and thought I'd give it a try. When I pulled into the line, the attendant was very nice and explained the wash options to me. I chose the $8 wash since I really do need the clear coat, but didn't need the tire wash and shine. Line moved quickly and my car came out shiny and clean. I then pulled over to the self service vacuum area and cleaned the inside of my car, which was awesome. All in all good experience and I will be back.

I stumbled across this place yesterday and I must say, I was impressed. Anyone who loves cooking would love this place. I have several food allergies, so this place was great as all their spice blends are very clear about what is in it. No surprises like the regular store spices. I found some spice blends I recognized and some that were new and interesting. Something for every palate. I'll definitely be back again to purchase more spices.

Brittany was my stylist. Did an amazing job. Very professional and friendly. The salon is beautiful and clean. They only use non harsh non animal tested products which is why i chose this salon on the first place. Very different experience from a traditional salon. As there are no offensive chemical smells or toxic fumes. I recommend this salon to anyone and i will definitely be back.

Quick, friendly service. Clean tables. Ordered the greek salad with chicken. I loved everything other than the spice, which I think was allspice on the chicken. Just not my something I care for. Got a side of tzaiki for my pita bread and it was wonderfully light,  fresh and delicious. Friend had the gyro, that was good as well. Will be back to try more menu items. Wish they had a chicken gyro though.

LOVE this place, it's wonderful and unique. Prices are high, however it's an art boutique, so it's expected. I bought a wonderful print from a local artist being showcased here for a reasonable price. Supporting local art is very important to me, so if it is to you too, this is a great place to get some pieces. I also enjoyed the antiques mixed in among the paintings and prints. I will be back anytime I am in need of a cool unique piece of something!

Such a great find! I am gluten free so finding places with good options is hard. I had gluten free blueberry pancakes with bacon and it was delicious! Waitress was wonderful answering all my questions and service was quick. Boyfriend had french toast with eggs and bacon and he said that was awesome. Looked good for sure! All in all great and we will be back to try more things.

Disappointing. Stopped in for lunch recently with my sister and I ordered the chicken and broccoli and it was just lacking in flavor. I was looking forward to the egg drop soup which is one of my favorite things to order out, but theirs was just OK. Nothing memorable or really that savory. My sister had the chicken lo mein and it was slightly sweet and pretty greasy. She was not feeling well afterwards, so I'm not sure if it was from all the grease or maybe something was spoiled. It was also hot when we were dining which was uncomfortable. They had the door open which I'm assuming was to cool it down. Normally this would be nice however someone was smoking a few feet away, so the odor came right in. We will not be back.

I had really high hopes for this place. However last Saturday night my boyfriend and I stopped in to this place in hopes to have dinner. Upon arrival the hostess/server told us that it shouldn't be more than an hour wait and that she could call us when a table opens up. This was not exactly the best thing to hear and felt like if that was the norm on a Saturday night than reservations should be recommended somewhere. Since we really really wanted to have the food, we gave her our number and left. After walking around the city we made our way back about 40 minutes later just to check in and see how much longer she thought it would be. When we came back in we just stood there and this other male finally came up to us and asked if we'd been helped. He sat us down and we filled out our menu. The server than came over, looked at our menu selections, and said the kitchen is closed, only sushi is served at dinner. Granted, I understand this is a sushi place and my boyfriend wanted sushi, however I wanted vegetable tempura and chicken teriyaki. Nowhere is it posted that the full menu is not served during the evenings. So after waiting all that time and having less than desirable service, we then find out I cannot order anything I wanted so we left. I am totally disappointed.

I'm here a few times a week with my dog (the large dog side). Considering the craziness that takes place at most dog parks this one is pretty relaxed. Most of the dog owners here are pretty responsible here handling their dogs and cleaning up after them. It's super convenient and has a lot of space for all the large dogs.

I was surprised by this little place! Saw them pop up about a month or so ago. Nice to have another place open on Saturdays close to my neighborhood as most are closed weekends. Decor is clean and modern, customer service was good, and food was done quickly. I was happy to see they cooked and prepared everything while I waited so it was fresh. I orded a greek chicken platter with rice and salad as my sides. Chicken was flavorful and moist, rice was perfectly tender and spiced, salad was fresh and had the right amount of everything. I was happy their tziki sauce was light and creamy and the pita was fluffy. I will definitely be back.

Overall good experience. My parents have been raving about this place for a while so I decided to try it. My boyfriend absolutely loved his meat lovers pizza, he had bacon, sausage, pepperoni and ham (i think) on there. I sampled a few peices of the sausage and it had a very clean, savory flavor, not like the greasy clumps of junk other places put on pizza. I had a salad since I have a slight gluten sensitivity. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was for selling Udi's Gluten Free pizza dough. I'm not sure if anyone who works there has ever actually tried the product, but I have a few times and the taste is horrible. I was hoping they'd offer something else, maybe eventually they will. The salad I had was good, I enjoyed the lemon oil dressing which was light and refreshing. I think they should allow as many vegetables as you want in the salad for no charge, but the counter girl told me 3 only. Maybe I was hoping for too much, but I was disappointed by that. The decor was nice, modern and clean. Bathrooms were also clean and in good repair which is a great thing since most places seem to overlook the importance of a clean bathroom for theit guests. I'll definitely be back.
