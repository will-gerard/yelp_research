I will preempt this with the fact that I seriously dislike dentists and I have severe anxiety from several bad encounters with dentists, thus this dentist should have taken the time to sit me down and talk to me before shoving me into an X-ray chair and demanding a full mouth X-ray for the cleaning I had scheduled.  Firstly, this is a very small office. The condescending hamplanet Dorothy at the front desk telling me that "it's Arizona law" that you have to get a full set of 18 X-rays on your first visit for a cleaning I had scheduled via phone could have easily expressed that at the time I made the appointment. I would have found a dentist who wouldn't try to gouge my insurance company on the first visit, and an office that isn't going to spout hilarious "law" rhetoric at me.  Secondly, they have you sign a waiver stating that the insurance coverage is "not guaranteed" and the patient will be responsible for any overages. Not uncommon, but don't tell me it's "AZ law" to get a set of 18 x-rays when it's obvious you are bilking insurance companies.   Third, Dr. Eric the dentist was nice enough, but don't talk over me when I'm voicing my concerns. I have legitimate concerns regarding costs, and you're simply stating that you "have to do x-rays" for the cleaning I scheduled. Excellent, do a couple of x-rays, maybe 6 or 8, not 18.   I up and left this office while discussing the complete lack of patient disregard so they can gouge my insurance company for everything they can. I will be informing my insurance company that no services were preformed and that they should not pay them one cent.   If money is no object, then by all means, go and get gouged by these insurance company leeches. I do not recommend it for new patients as they don't even bother to speak with you and instead shove you in a chair and start taking X-rays whilst bilking your insurance company for every penny they can.

The food is great, for cheap food. This isn't a 5 star Michelin rating, this is cheap chinese food. Their schezuan beef is super yum. Service is quick, and quiet.

They took my cat in at 8am on Saturday morning and removed his bleeding tumor on his leg. They treated him rapidly and got rid of the tumor. There were no hidden fees or extra charges for anything. They are great at the Southside Animal Hospital.

Barro's pizza will always be my favorite pizza for the great price it is. Highly recommend whether eating in or taking out. Try Barro's at least once.

This place is a dump. RUN AWAY.  I can hear the neighbor upstairs hacking and coughing every time he takes bong rip. I can also hear every time he pees very clearly and loud. And sadly I can hear his girlfriend faking it in bed, poor fella. Really guys, jackrabbitt-ing her doesn't cut the mustard.  The shower has backed up with sewage TWO TIMES in a 30 day period. When the second time was on a Sunday night, it was found that the emergency maintenance line goes to NOWHERE. No pager, no voicemail, just a "Call back later". This is illegal in the state of Arizona.  Roaches and ants abound. You will find both in your apartment, without fail.  The multitudes of feral cats are pretty nice though. They won't let you pet them, but they aren't pests at all.  Do not ever rent here. This dump should be condemned and torn down.

Sadly, the food is really delicious at the Arrogant Butcher, but waiting 1.5+ hours for our meals THEN subsequently finding a hair on the plate was truly unacceptable.  You will not be seeing me again Arrogant Butcher. And I would not be able to recommend this place due to the fact that they only wanted to compensate us with a $6 dessert. Really? That's all you can do for a $100 dinner? Appalling.   We waited over an hour an a half for a medium rare filet mignon, and a hamburger. THEN once we were eating there was a hair UNDER the creamed spinach on the filet mignon's plate. My hair is brown and curly and 6+ inches long. My companion's hair is blond and about 3+ inches long. The hair on the plate was black and thick and about 1.5inches long. Yet you refused to comp us anything but a $6 dessert? Really?? Really? Arrogant indeed

This location of Maricopa OBGYN called my cell phone for 2 WEEKS day and night, trying to send a fax to a cell phone. Brilliant though medical front office personnel are, they couldn't bother to call the number they were trying to fax and see if it was actually a fax machine. I called and left a voicemail, after at least 100 calls from their fax machine, and the faxes still continued to come. Delightfully, they dropped me as a patient because I was done getting fax machine calls. Considering they can't send a fax properly, perhaps this is in my best interest. Thanks Maricopa OBGYN! You guys are real winners.

Bootleggers, I WANTED to love you. I did. And you made me sad face.   First, the meat is amazing. Flavorful and melt in your mouth amazing. But you cannot get a 5 star review based on the virtue of your meat alone, and your spotty service and incomplete meal prove that you think otherwise.   The bartender did not know what kind of beer, IPA specifically, that was even on tap. Dogfishhead IPA...great, which one sir? Very disappointing.  The PBLT, which is described as Pork Belly, Lettuce, and Tomato was absent the Tomato. I was going to mention this to the bartender/server but he NEVER reappeared.  Our uncleared dishes sat on our table for 20 minutes or more while the bartender/server flirted with two chicks sitting at the bar.  I had to get up and ask the hostesses (multiple hostesses, why? You only need one Bootleggers) who were dancing, singing, and folding napkins to get me a box for my remaining food.   All around very disappointing experience, and although your meat is divine, I will not be providing Bootleggers any further business.  Once you get your service straightened out you could be a top notch restaurant.

I had a small simple job, and Phoenix Custom lasering treated me as if I was a top dollar customer.  They provided excellent service, quick turnaround time, and my laser engraved knife looks excellent!  I would highly recommend this company for any of your engraving needs.

This place is owned by the people who formerly owned Crazy Jim's!  The Greek salad was delicious. The gyro was tasty. The pizza that was part of the Chris' Dinner special was super tasty with pepperoni, feta, and fresh tomato. The only thing that needs work is the french fries which were soggy and full of oil. I absolutely recommend this place. I will be back for a salad in the future!
