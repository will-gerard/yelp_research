Having Tammie Coe & MJ Bread move into my neighborhood truly changed our day-to-day.  Though the cakes are pretty and I'm sure the baked goods are great too (they always have samples so you can find out) it is the MJ Bread that rocks our world.  We buy delicious whole grain bread from our local baker - have it sliced and the PB&J's are a beautiful kind of new!  We love the Ciabatta, the sourdough, the batard- they all make their way to the porch and get enjoyed by all the family & neighbors every week.  The only problem is if you don't get their early enough you may miss out on your favorite loaf.  We don't typically despair -- just try something new.

Sadly,  we had a horrible experience there tonight.  Let me start with some background:  I am a Phoenix native and have been to Mary Coyle's more times than I can count.  My sister worked there many moons ago and I live mere blocks away from the store.   I desperately want this to be a successful venture for the new owner and most of all I want a great go-to spot for my husband and my kids (grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc.). I have a fantasy that this place turns into a great joint to bring clients for lunch and a solid place for food and ice cream.  Tonight, I went with kids.  Me and three kids to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  What could be better?  I wasn't looking forward to the dinner menu but I was hopeful that the new ownership had improved the mediocre food and the time we spent having dinner would pass without incident to get us to the main event:  ICE CREAM!!!  Here's what happened:  We were ignored for about 15-20 minutes before anyone came to our table.  At that time there were only two other tables with customers in the entire restaurant.  Drink orders were taken, crayons requested.  Drinks came two by two, crayons requested again and finally arrived.  Dinner order taken another 10-15 minutes later  and then dinner arrived.  The kids dinner of hot dogs all around (1/2 of a dog/kid) were well received though they could have stood an entire hotdog.  I ordered Chili.  The chili didn't taste bad but it unfortunately it didn't ,actually, taste at all.  The kids ate their food pretty quickly and I finished my 6 bites of chili (all I could do)  and was ready for the ice cream order.    110 minutes after we arrived we got up and went to the register where our server and the manger were stationed.  No one had come to our table to ask how our food was, to refill our beverages, to clear our table, to take our ice cream order or to even walk past.  My kids went to the ice cream during this time and got samples of the flavors and had decided what they wanted to order.  We waited and waited and waited.  I called out a polite "excuse me" to no avail as our server walked by.  Finally from our booth I called a nearby ice cream shop to see if they had a wait.  I was told they didn't and I gathered my kids and went to the register to leave.  I said to my server:  "you never came back to my table, you never came back"  "we sat and sat and you never came to our table" she said to me:  "your total is $21.??".  That was it.  That was my evening out to celebrate my daughter's August birthday at my neighborhood joint with her brother and her best friend.  I'm stunned.  I want this to be a great place but I would settle for a good place.  I hope that one day it is that place but it will take some time for the bad taste in my mouth to go away.

I just lunched at the northern-most Humble Pie location.  Landing in the sea of corporate restaurants I was excited to find (on Yelp) that Humble Pie was also located here and provided a great option for the bajillions of homes and homeowners nearby (and this center city girl out of her backyard).  They have an outside option earning any Phoenix restaurant at least 1 star.  Atmosphere was good.  The service was really efficient though a bit lacking in personality (hey, anyone can have an 'off' day though).  Shrimp pizza was great.  Looking at the shrimp before biting in I was sure they were going to be bland and have an off texture BUT I was quite wrong.  Veggie salad is a chop style salad and quite good.  Salt adds a lot to their fresh mozzarella, in the salad. but my husband reminds that it adds to his high blood pressure too.  Fortunately for me--my blood pressure is low - go SALT.  Enjoy, I did.

Just visited America's again tonight for my third visit.  I'd say it's time for a review:  I love this place.  This corner spot has run through so many restaurants and finally they have one that is going to stick!  I've always gone on Thursday nights so I can't say what it's like on other nights or days of the week.  I've run into friends each time I've ventured in for my hour-long stay.  I've also chatted up perfect strangers - frankly, that's not so unusual for me though so I won't go on.  Suffice it to say it's a friendly neighborhood joint.  Tonight's special was Burro de pastor.  A marinated and grilled pork with guacamole, pineapple, cilantro and other tasty bits.  My 3 year old, 5 year old and 45 year old husband loved them.  We also had the Vampiro which was delicious too.  A corn tortilla with the pastor pork, guacamole & caramelized onions mmmmm.  Kids also order the fail-safe quesadilla.  It's good - how bad can cheese in a flour tortilla be?  Thing is, I don't want to order quesadillas for my kids.  The last time I was there we had the carne asada--my husband and I both love it, the kids didn't love it.  The pastor is ideal for them though, a little sweet and a lot of savory.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful.  Enjoy it

I can't say enough great about this truck and about everything that surrounds it's management and follow-through.  We hired the truck for a private party and everything went off flawlessly.  The food is outstanding and the service is just as good.  The dumplings, the chicken even the ice tea were huge hits.   This is the way to cater a party.  Hire great truck, truck brings, cooks and delivers great food, all mess and fuss drive away with the truck.  Smiling, happy, laughing guests are both nourished by great food and delighted with Jake, a great host!!
