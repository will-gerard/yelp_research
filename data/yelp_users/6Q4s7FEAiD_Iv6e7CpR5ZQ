Worst Food City, I've ever been to. Unorganized, no deli, no bakery, little staff, rude cashier. No first aid items, couldn't even buy an aspirin. I love other Food City stores, not this one. Will not surprise me if they shutdown.

Sweetest counter owners/ladies. Best pizza. Fast friendly service. Just a little hole in the wall sort of place. Awesome food.

Such a nice shop. oils, herbs, books, stones, etc. Service was friendly, unfortunately on Saturday the poor counter woman was dealing with a rude customer in a busy store. They could use more help. If you go be patient.

Impossible to find anything on this school, which I wish I had taken as a red flag, The classes are just note taking, instructors and staff are not helpful. When taking you exam there is no quiet place. It has now cost me double because I've enrolled at a true Real Estate school. Save your money, and shop around. I know for a fact this place isn't even up to date.

I wish I had read the reviews. Waste of money. Went mainly for vacuum, and had to redo when I got home. Save your money. So disappointed.

Way over priced. Lots of cool decor, especially if you want mermaids. Some items were too out of reach to even look at, and staff was no where to be found. Just too cluttered, watch your step.

I've been going to this Cost Cutters for close to two years. I was referred by a friend whose whole family has been going for years. I love the staff! So friendly, and so willing to help. Yes, they get busy, because they are so good. I always schedule ahead and never have a problem getting in. Highly recommend for cut and color!

Delicious food every time. Cheap prices. Fast service. Friendly, family owned business. Just like a little place you would find down in Honolulu.

Awesome burgers and the onion rings are addicting. It is the cutest little hippy joint and has the friendliest staff. Yum...

Good burgers,  fries are addicting.  The staff so super friendly. Not a lot of area to sit, so useless you're comfortable with ppl right on top of you, take to go.

The food was excellent. I had the French Dip and my husband had the Lamb burger. Others in our party ate off the Gluten Free menu and loved it. The staff was friendly. Our waitress however was not very good, not awful. If we got her again I'd say something. Overall yummy.

First timer. Staff is so nice. Place is so busy, good sign. Food was very good, although a bit over priced on some items. Would definitely go back.

Save your money, go down the street. I got a quesadilla Pollo, was an oily ball of cheese, burnt tortilla. Guacamole awful, slime. Best thing was bottled Coke. Not worth over $7. to throw away.
