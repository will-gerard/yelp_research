I went in to this location last night with a group of 4 for a birthday dinner. Our server was Sydney, she was extremely unattentive, slow, and wasn't aware of the evenings soup or specials. We ordered a bottle of one of their nicer wines and we're served in water glasses. The manager Kelly informed us this was typical which would have been over looked however when we were served, Sydney complained that we could have normal glasses though the bartender would get upset at her for asking. Also, we were never offered another bottle or upsale. She also failed to remove the dishes from earlier courses, so when we received the dessert for the birthday boy that was supposed to be on the house  ( that still made it on to our bill ) the table hardly had any space for it. After our lack of service, and waiting for over 10 min to pay the iccorrect bill. One member of our party asked to speak with a manager, he waited at the host stand for a long while before Kelly appeared. She seemed unpleasant and upset to deal with a patron and when she went to adjust the dessert price she rolled her eyes at our table. Then quickly left the front of the house without an apology or handling the situation, instead left it up to the already slow and unenthused server to tend the bill. I have been in the industry for over 9 years and have never made a complaint that should explain how horrible the "service" was. I'd give it negative stars if possible.

Extremely dissatisfied. I am a long time regular to the Las Vegas strip, however I had never stayed at the New York New York. Upon my arrival (5pm) the employee that checked us in was rude, pressured us to "upgrade" to a room without the strip view I requested then was very nasty after I declined. Finally got to the room and it hadn't been cleaned, trash everywhere, used soap, etc. We called down to get it cleaned and they protested for 10 mins giving me grief before agreeing to send someone up though I arrived 2 hours after the scheduled check in plenty of time to clean. Also the safe was stuck locked and I had to wait almost an hour for a member of security to reset it. The room keys provided, only one worked from the start, the first evening both weren't working and the attendant that I spoke with to replace them yelled at me and insisted that I was carrying magnets!! (I was not) she gave me the worst attitude and  insulted me. I certainly will NEVER stay here again and urge all of my friends and family to do the same. My advice, don't even come here for anything, staff is rude and the place is disgusting!
