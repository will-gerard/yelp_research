For everything theater-related...you simply MUST check out the Herberger Theater Center in downtown Phoenix!  The have great community education classes, lunchtime theater, and events constantly on each of their big stages!  Check them out, support the arts, laugh, cry make them a part of you...sorry...that last part sounded a bit creepy!

Long story short...I have been taking my Avalanche to Freeway since I bought it from them in 2003.  Things started feeling fishy when I was told I needed new brakes.  I got a second opinion at a brake shop and they told me my brakes were just fine (they actually lasted another year)!  Just took my truck in and was given a $3400 estimate for repairs!  Ouch!  Took it to an reputable mechanic and was charged $934 for THE SAME WORK!  Freeway Chevrolet has lost a previously very loyal customer and I will make SURE everyone I know knows about how they conduct business!  Oh...the staff IS very friendly...if they are successfully fleecing their customers like they tried to me...they can afford to be!

Lonnie,    I understand why you must charge more.  I really do.  What angers me is suggesting repairs I don't even need!  This is the second time this has been done.  The first time was to replace brakes that I thought were fine.  I took my truck to a brake shop and they said there was absolutely NOTHING wrong with my brakes.  It was a YEAR later that they needed replacement!  This time it was for a multitude of front-end work that didn't need to be done.  I would much rather give my business to a shop that wants my repeat business through honest means, than by adding repairs that "could" be done, but don't "need" to be done.  John

If you need something quick and your order accurate...perhaps you should go elsewhere.  This Wendy's helps to reinforce my diet by reminding me never to frequent THIS one ever again.  I'm not against Wendy's as a whole...just the lack of caring from THIS particular one.  Perhaps it's the area...Of all the fast food on this corner...NONE of them tend to give a rats @$$ about the customer.  Oh well...thanks Wendy's for the bad service, horrible accuracy and a restaurant that smells of sewage for some odd reason because without bad fast food like you're likely to find at this location, I think my waistline would have doubled!  I like to call it my "don't-ever-eat-at-this-restaurant-again" diet.

Had I written this review last year, I would have given Family Vetcare of Chandler a very different number of stars.  My wife took both of our dogs in last year and came home upset because the vet she saw made her feel like a bad "pet mom" and proceeded to talk down to her.  We decided to give them another try and discovered that the veterinarian that made her feel so horrible was no longer there and we saw Dr. Travis Wodiske.  What a difference!  So glad we went back!  I cannot recommend Dr. Wodiske and the staff of Family Vetcare of Chandler highly enough.  They recognized a problem within their organization and fixed it!

I've used Reliable for glass replacement and repair on many cars throughout the years.  I tried another company, but after being late for a 4 hour window (AND being about $60 higher in cost), I went right back to reliable (never to stray again!)!  Their techs always call and are right on time when they say they will be!  Love this company.  Keep up the outstanding work Reliable!

I am a pretty big guy and have had bad luck with chiropractors in the past. Dr Martin made me a believer.  He's one of the few chiropractors who listen to your problem and doesn't just give you a generic pre- patterned treatment.  He knows how to manipulate to get the job done (not always easy to do on a guy my size)!  I always and will always recommend Driftwood Chiropractic to every body looking for a good chiropractor.

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.  So call me crazy because I continue to give this place a chance after it has been proven over and OVER again that they most certainly do NOT deserve it!  I remember a time, in the not so distant past, when Elephant Bar was new and had a great menu and good people serving their clientele.  A time that will forever remain in the past as NOW their customer service is horrible, their overpriced menu is bland and boring and the clientele is slowly learning that a dining experience as they're likely to get here now belongs, at best, at the old Ed DeBevics!  I had to actually get up after a 15 minute wait to ask who our server was.  After thanking the hostess for that information I asked if it would be possible to actually MEET said server as we had been sitting for a quarter of an hour without that distinct honor.  45 minutes after being seated saw us to our actual food...missing some key ingredients I might add!  Apparently there was a shortage of iced tea that particular evening because there were no refreshings-of-beverages for us!  Oh...and if you're going to roll your eyes at me, dear waitress, for saying to you that "yes, we WOULD still like the appetizer that we ordered half an hour ago and you failed to bring us"...please have, not only the good manners, but the intelligence to make sure my 11 year old daughter doesn't see it (kinda reflects in your tip)!  Previous visits included the same long wait to have our order taken.  The wrong food.  The RIGHT food, but as cold as a Stouffers Hungry-Man dinner fresh out of the freezer...oh...and gray shrimp:  (very slight dramatization) Me:  These aren't cooked. Server:  The chef cooked them. Me:  Show the chef...these are still raw. Server:  I think they're supposed to look like that. Me:  Show the chef and see what they think. (wait and return) Server:  The chef cooked them longer. Me:  Why are they still gray? Server:  That's just how shrimp look: Me:  Yes it is...WHEN THEY'RE FREAKING RAW!!  We went on Mother's Day because there was no wait...now we know why.  Stupid us...we ALREADY knew why!    Spend your money elsewhere so this location can close down and hopefully open a restaurant that gives a crap!

Wow!  Very impersonal staff bordering rudeness.   Wouldn't want to pick a fish from the very filthy fish tank!  YUCK!  Tea tasted just like water, but was the color of tea...still trying to figure out where the taste went!  I'd move on to the next restaurant on the list were I you.

My wife's Entourage broke down and my Avalanche had a check engine light coming on all in the same week.  I reached out to friends via social networking and they pointed me to Brian Slaughter and his shop.  SOOOO glad they did!  This guy is a straight shooter!  He got my wife up and running in no time.  I took my truck initially to the dealer to have it looked at.  After an estimate of $3400 to repair (dang!), I decided to take it in to Brien.  Again...SOOOOO glad I did.  He saved me $2500!!!!!!!!  He pointed out all of the extra work the dealership wanted to do that just wasn't necessary AND explained in layman's terms why!  They have a new customer for life because of their honesty and integrity and I can't highly recommend them enough!   Oh...and every time I called...Brian himself always answered the phone.  Every time I dropped off or picked up a vehicle...he was there to explain everything they did and why.  Now THAT'S customer service!!

I am just NEVER let down by Brian Slaughter and his shop!  I just took my Chevy Avalanche in to have the A/C fixed.  Got a quote (which I had researched) that was very reasonable for the work that needed to be done.  Long story short...work came in UNDER quoted amount and that was WITH an oil change (which they did because they noticed I needed one)!  Love this shop!  My ONLY complaint is that they don't often call back after leaving a message to do so.  Phone contact can be an issue.

Been here many times (unfortunately).  They always got me in and out quickly.  Never had an issue here.

This location just opened in June and I finally stopped in last night with friends to check it out.  SO glad we did!  There were six of us so I had the opportunity to try a bit of everything!  Such a great menu and I couldn't find a dish on our table that wasn't awesome!  A bit pricey, but well worth it!
