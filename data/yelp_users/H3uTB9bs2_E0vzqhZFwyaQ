best fishing shop I have ever been to!  They were making elk sausage that one of the worker had taken this year and instead of just eating it in front of me they loaded me a huge bowl and some gravy and a biscuit and said enjoy.  It was the laast biscuit and it was for the owner but they gave it to me instead. I sat down and ate it and BS'd with the fly fishing expert a pro fisherman and a worker and laughed so hard i almost wet myself.  They have anything you need and will find it if you have some off the wall request.  highly recommend this place. They are located next to Rochelle's spa and salon and www.ClarityChiro.com other great local businesses too.

Get my hair done every other week and never once have I had a poor cut. I stopped telling Tina how to cut my hair and just let her choose because every time it is exactly what I wanted without even knowing it. Rochelle cut and styled my hair for my wedding and it was amazing. The talent in Rochelle's is unmatched anywhere in the state/country. I highly recommend RSS. They are located next to www.Claritychiro.com  and phoenix fishing supply.

I wish I could rate each individual because Roberto Escobedo was horrible. (Branch manager). He receives a 0-5. He was rude and very condescending. I had closed my account on Thursday and received a call to speak with him. I came in Monday to speak with him and get my statements because my online access had been disabled. He wanted to charge me to get my statements of which I already paid for (Service fee) but did not receive. He informed me that if I would have called him back Friday he would have done it for me, now that it was Monday he wouldn't do it for me.   Well Vanessa Farias was awesome. She gets a 5-5. She worked with me and helped me obtain what I needed. She was very friendly, and helpful. thank you!!!  If you were running the place I probably would still have my accounts there.   I closed my account because of another branch. (16 th and camelback).  Always new faces and ever changing "policy" not to mention understaffed and undertrained tellers are few reasons I left.   I am always hopeful they get their act together, maybe let Vanessa train a few people. I may check them out in the future, because I love community banks, and what they stand for.

I would give 0-5 if I could. First the front office is extremely rude ( I dealt with Patty) if any of my employees treated patients the way she did they'd be sitting on a curb. While in the waiting room an obviously mentally deficient patient came in and another front desk lady treated her like she was a bother and didn't help her at all.  Secondly they don't have their insurance down. And lastly while I was in the waiting room I could hear her talking to the other ladies in the front office talking smack about patients.   I am a doctor and have referred many patients here and will no longer do it. I guess simonmed It is.

Rodi was very talented and took her time to make sure she gave me a great cut.   I do admit I cheated on my regular stylist, because I couldn't get in, and I'm very happy I did.   I would recommend her to anyone.

Not only does Kevin from In-Phase fix AC units he also fixed all the fans in my house that were off balance.  He did not charge me for it, he just did it because it needed to be done and it would help the air flow to better cool off my house in the heat.  He explained everything and was reasonably priced.  He runs a family business too!  i will definitely recommend him to every one that wants the job done and done right.
