I love the fact that I found this office after having a horrendous experience with another OBGYN (Tara brodkin). I don't know how people complain about the waiting time. I've always been helped in time. The ladies in the front desk are very nice and every time I call I've never been put on hold. They ALWAYS answer your questions. I see Dr. De Santo and he's just simply AMAZIG. I trust him a lot because you can tell how knowledgeable he is. He answers all your questions and gives you a lot of ultrasounds to check on baby. I'm so happy I found a doctor I feel I can trust with my first pregnancy. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Even the lady that draws your blood is such a pro. I'm always scared to death to have my blood taken but I swear she takes like 2 seconds and makes it so quick it's impressive.

I don't want to speculate that the other ladies in here are either friends or family of dr brodkin but that would be my only explanation for these reviews. Let me tell you my horror history in this office. I went to doctor brodkin because I saw these reviews and expected t he best. This is my first pregnancy and Dr brodkin and her staff have been the least caring or competent. I've had 3 appointments at this office and only saw the doctor ONCE. She will send you her PA to see you and perform the Pap smear and pelvic exams. Also make sure you have pleeeeenty of time for their HOUR long wait. They will bring you in and have you wait an HOUR to see you. The last appointment I had was for a colposcopy where I finally met dr brodkin. She took an hour to see us (no surprise) and came in the room with a horrible attitude, again this is the first time I ever saw the doctor, because my husband asked twice when were we going to be helped. She made the colposcopy so painful and was extremely mean about me moving and not letting her finish her job. I wanted to cry the whole time! I did end up fainting at the end of the procedure and she LEFT THE ROOM to bring her nurses in. She didn't say anything about my baby or listened to baby's heartbeat or nothing!!! I trusted this office with my first pregnancy but haven't seen or heard my baby in over a month!!!! She's mean disrespectful of your time and careless about you or your baby. I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt and think she may be better as a gyno only, don't trust her with your pregnancy I've had a horrifying experience with this people and I wouldn't even recommend "doctor" brodkin to my worst enemy. I'm desperate to hear my baby and will find a different doctor ASAP. DO NOT GO HERE!!!

This place is amazing. I went in with 11 of my friends to find baby sex and to have our baby's first 4d ultrasound. The image is very clear and they told me I was having a girl which I later confirmed with my doctor. Went in at 16 weeks. We did the $79 package which in my opinion is the best one. They accommodate all of us comfortably and the experience lasted about 15 minutes maybe a little less. I think the location is a little off because the people that were outside looked a little weird I don't know what they were waiting for but I think this place is about right for the price and quality. I would definitely recommend it to my friends it was a nice experience. They have a huge salon to accommodate your guests although when we just got there it was a bit snug don't let that fool you. Overall it was a good experience we'll be coming back later in my pregnancy as they gave me a discount ticket. Good place and fair price where everywhere else was really expensive. I would recommend it to my friends. The technician was knowledgable and nice too.

I lovee mood swings salon I don't see myself going anywhere else. Been their customer for more than a year and I ways leave with a smile in my face. I know going to the salon sometimes can a be quite stressful and other salons don't truly get you. Here is not the case at all, they listen to you, give you advice and have the best products to work with. I always get my highlights with sandy, she's incredible and I swear it's like she reads my mind every time I go see her. I'm currently 4 months pregnant and got my highlights done after 4 months!! My roots were insanely large but she left them so beautiful, she always knows what she is doing and she made me feel secure about dying my hair being pregnant (of course I did ask my doctor before hand). Like I said I just don't see myself going anywhere else. If you go to the one in scottsdale go see Alexandra she did my hair once before she went to scottsdale and she is pretty amazing too. My mom also goes to this salon and loves it I don't remember the girl who helps her but she loooves her too. They're all so professional and their prices are very fair. I LOVE MOOD SWINGS!!!!

After learning sandy doesn't currently work here anymore I was nervous and sad! I felt like I lost my favorite stylist ever!!!!!  I really thought I would never find anybody like her. But boy was I wrong. Ashlee IS AMAZING!!! I'm so glad I booked her. I'm also glad we can see pics and read a little bit about their stylists before we go in. Something told me to pick her and IM So super happy I did because she's SUCH a pro!!! Everytime I leave mood swings I have the biggest smile on my face. I don't know how they do it but I'm sure somehow they train their stylists super good to do an incredible job on us customers and leave us so happy all the time. Thank you mood swings and thank you Ashlee you did an incredible job today!

In one word: AWESOME!! jenny is trully amazing, she is soooo sweet and she has done such a great job I CANT WAIT TO WEAR MY WEDDING DRESS!!! She did about 4 different things to my gown, I didn't think she was that much pricier than davids bridal. She's so nice and friendly it was like having my dress altered with a longtime friend.  She has worked at neiman markus before and she knows very well what she does, she did such a great quality  work on my dress, and she even gives you advice, for example my dress is pretty big therefore is a little heavy so i kept grabbing it because i had the felling it was falling (it is an strapless dress) she did something to it the next time i saw her and by the end of our appointment she said, im happy to see you dont have the need to keep grabbing your dress anymore, i fixed that!! shes so knowledgeable since she has been doing what she does for so long. I seriously can only say good things about jenny, im so glad i went to her shop i feel like i made a new friend. I recommend her to everyone!! she is so great!!!!
