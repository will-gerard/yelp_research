Best brunch in the Phoenix Metro Area - food is excellent! Christian is the best server/bartender. He makes a great iced coffee, and won't forget your Sriracha sauce!

I would actually rate them 0 stars. Clarence Ferguson is a liar and a rip-off artist. I paid him in advance for 3 months of training. In mid-February after being out of town for 2 weeks he sent me a sappy email to tell me he was taking a step back from training, which turns out is a lie. I paid him for 3 months of training and only got 1 month. I have it in writing from him that he would refund me on March 5th for the remaining 2 months, but low and behold he is now not returning my calls, texts or emails. DO NOT HIRE Clarence. He is also extremely unprofessional and spent most of our sessions hitting on me. Ladies beware and anyone who is considering hiring him, DO NOT trust him with your money.
