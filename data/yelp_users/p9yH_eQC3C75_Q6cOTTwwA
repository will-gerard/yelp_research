I love this place!!  From the second I walked in the door, I was made to feel at home.  I received a true honest "hello" and the owner (Marie, I think) was friendly and engaging.    Prices were very reasonable and coffee was great.  (Not anything like that bitter Starbucks crud.)  I needed to get some work done so I whipped out the laptop and guess what .. FREE WiFi!!  The owner definitely put some thought and effort into making this place comfortable and relaxed.  There is even a bookshelf with about 50 books and newspapers lined above.    Menu shows that they also serve sandwiches, veggie sandwiches, salads, and a light breakfast.

I must have gone on a bad day .....  Shortly after walking in, we were seated but no one came to take our drink order for at least 10 minutes and then it was only because we said something to a waiter walking by.  The Dim Sum selection was very small and the quality just wasn't that good.    Who charges for refills on a fountain drink anymore?  They did have a shrimp/crab egg roll that was real good!  I think you will find me at C-Fu Gourmet from now on.

This place takes all 5 stars for me.  Keep in mind, this is a cafe at an airport.  Their breakfast is good old fashion diner food, and they do it well.  However, what really makes this place for me is the service and view.  My family loves coming to watch the planes and eat a leisurely Sunday breakfast.  They are very kid friendly and my daughter always asks to go visit "the nice ladies with food at the airport."  I will remain a frequent flier.  (I know, it was lame!)

Their prices seem better than anywhere else.  I would check here first if you don't have insurance.  They are a compounding pharmacy.  Also, staff was really friendly and helpful.

This place doesn't skimp.  You order juice and you get juice.  Not watered down.  Not iced down.  Pure, straight up, juice.  The prices are a value for what you get.  Great place for an after workout drink.

OH YA!!!  (Kind of like the Kool-Aid Man would do it.)  This place is the BEST fattening burger around!  You know, the kind of burger that lumps up in your stomach for the rest of the day and puts you in a comatose state while staring at your office computer!    I would come here every day for lunch if I could (My waist wont allow me.)  I usually get the "fat ass burger deal" for $6.50.  To be honest, I would gladly pay $6.50 for the burger alone.  It's better than anything your going to find at Arby's or Wendy's.  However, for $6.50 you get a double meat double cheese burger with all the fixings, a LARGE bag of onion rings and fries, and two canned sodas to wash it down with.    The burger tastes like it is fresh to me.  In fact, I was talking with the owner one day and he was telling me they ground their own chuck and season it in house.  I know one of the reviews insinuated it was a frozen patty and if it is, I want to know where they buy them being it's so good.  (Although, with that said, I HIGHLY doubt it is one of Wal-Mart's finest patties.)  The tomatoes, lettuce, onion, and other toppings always burst with flavor.  They are fresh and never taste old, wilted, or soggy.    If your skinny and need to gain weight, this is the place to go!  If your fat and trying to kill your self off, this is the place to go!  If you just want a damn good burger at a damn good price, this is the only place to go!

After seeing the same barber for years, he took ill and I was forced to look for a good barber.  Any men that are picky about their haircuts will know it is REAL hard to find a good barber that your happy with.  Usually, I would just get a decent haircut and it was good enough.  Enough about me, lets talk about V's!  This IS my new place.  I have been in a few times now and they have done my hair perfectly each time.  Now be warned, this is not a $10 Supercut hair cut ..... this is a full service old time barber shop!    When you walk in just hope there is a little of a wait.  Almost every magazine a man could want is hanging on the racks.  Also, you can get a free shoeshine and enjoy what ever game is on the TV.  I have had separate barbers each time and both were interesting and  very professional in their skills.  There is a flat screen TV at each barber station and they will put on whatever game your interested in.  Each cut comes with a straight razor neck shave and a hot towel on your face.  The cut ends with a short, but relaxing back massage.  Cost was around $24, but I have to emphasize that you're not going to V's for just a haircut.  You're going for an experience, a moment to relax.

WooHoo! As good as it gets!  That's an understatement!  This place is a triple threat.  The decor is warm and relaxing, the service was great, and the food was spectacular!  We enjoyed the bruschetta for our appetizer.  The various flavors were great and the balsamic vinegar glaze couldn't be more flavorful.    For dinner, I had the gorgonzola crusted lamb cutlets.  AMAZING!!  You cant have that good of a meal and not indulge in a little dessert.  The creme brule  and terramassu were awesome.    It takes a lot to wow me but this place came through!

I love pho ..... I love pho like the next mo pho ....  I didn't say they were good, I just said I had them.  However, this place is much better than my jokes!  Totally hole in the wall.  You wouldn't go here for the atmosphere, but you would go here for the food.  Food so good and prices so cheap, I wonder how they even stay in business?  (Maybe its a money laundering front?)    The rare beef brisket pho is amazing.  No fake bases used here!  All of the vegetables are fresh and crisp.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the spring rolls and fried crab egg rolls.  Both are great but the spring rolls are my favorite.  These things could be a meal all by themselves! A little pork, a little shrimp, some rice noodles, vegetables, and a good amount of mint surrounded by a rice paper wrap.    If you like Vietnamese food and are in the area ... you would be crazy not to hit up this place!

Awesome customer service!  The gentleman that helped me gave me VERY detailed instructions on how the product works, and how to make it as effective as possible.  If you're a first time do it yourselfer .... This is the place to go to.

Great selection of cigars.  Knowledgeable and friendly staff. One of the most beautiful bars in the valley.

You want a cigar, and you're somewhere in Phoenix?   Drive on over to Baxter's Cigars.  Even if it's a bit a way, I guarantee it's worth the drive.  Here's why:  Selection: They have a good selection of all your standards. The humidor is well laid out and well stocked.    Lounge: They have a great lounge that feels like your front room.  Not only is the staff quick to greet you, but ALL the other customers are just downright good people.  You're going to feel comfortable and welcomed the moment you walk through the front door.  Two big screen TV's playing sports, a fridge with water and soft drinks, and some really comfortable chairs are at your disposal.  It's not the biggest of lounges in the valley, but what they lack for in size is made up by simply being comfortable and cozy.    Customer service: Let's face it, the Phoenix area is saturated with tons of places to grab and smoke a cigar.  What sets Baxter's apart is their employees and their attention to ensuring your time in the lounge is relaxing as possible.    Baxter's has a pretty cool vibe to it.  This is a great place for someone who's never had a cigar and just wants to check it all out.  Equally, great for someone like me that's been smoking longer than I care to admit.

Has the new standard been set?  Nope.  The standard has been shattered.  Fox Cigars in Scottsdale (Foxdale) has created the perfect atmosphere for lovers of fine cigars and alcohol alike.     With OVER 400 spirits, 15 tap handles, and a huge selection of cans and bottles ... You will find ANYTHING your little heart desires to drink.    Arguably, one of the largest humidor selections in AZ. You will find most any premium cigar you want.  At prices that are amazing!  Tons of TV's scattered throughout the comfortable lounge allows for watching your favorite game in one of their plush oversized leather chairs WHILE enjoying your cigar and drink.    The building is gorgeous and perfect to host a work meeting or a evening girls get together.    Even if you don't smoke cigars and want to come enjoy an awesome environment with an amazing selection of drinks, you will remain comfortable with their state of the art ventilation system.  Pretty sure someone with asthma would be fine in here!!  LOL!!      However, you can have the best cigar selection, the best alcohol and beer selection, of any cigar lounge and it's not worth anything if your not comfortable, receiving great customer service, and feel like you belong.  Well, don't worry because Fox Cigars has that covered.  The staff are extremely customer service orientated and will take the best care of you.  Novice smoker?  They will help you pick out just the right cigar and help you find a drink that pairs perfectly.  No one is pretentious because Fox has shattered the old stereotypes of cigar smoking.    I'm a fan of the new place and would wholeheartedly recommend you swinging by and checking it out.  You won't regret it!!

I don't typically write negative reviews, but this is one of the worst experiences I've had with a "professional company" I'm a long time.   They have a 4 hour window to arrive and never called to tell me they weren't going to make it.  Then when I called I was informed I would have to wait for an indefinite amount of time.  Apparently the tech was on a bigger and more important job.  When I said this was unacceptable, Kelly ultimately hung up on me.  I haven't had someone hang up on me since I was in high school!!  LOL.    If your insurance company provides you Ava as a contractor please do yourself a favor and request someone else.  If these people can't operate a phone how in the heck can they be competent enough to repair an appliance?  Rod, send me an email or give me a call.  I'd love to talk to you about Kelly hanging up on me and your staff wasting my time.
