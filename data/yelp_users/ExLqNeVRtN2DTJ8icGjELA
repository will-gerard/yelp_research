My favorite neighborhood bar... Been coming here for years and always a friendly face to see with delicious wings...  Definitely recommend if you're new to the area or just in town for a day or two.  Sunday Fundays are the best!

Ok, so I finally decide to take advantage of my insurance. Grrr, great insurance I have, now Im stuck with this place.   Waiting wasn't bad, had an appointment for 9 got sat at 910, ok I'll give em one. Then they take my X-rays, not bad. But then to see the dentist I sat around for another 15 mins. Finally she comes in, not friendly at all, starts poking at my mouth and tells me what I need. Later they come back with a bill for $240 when I just came in for a cleaning that my insurance covers.  They take out old fillings and put in new ones. I never had a problem with my old ones, no pain or anything, and now I have these scratchy ones in my mouth. Dentist leaves with no follow up, I walk myself to the desk for the next appointment and she hands me a card because I don't know when I'll be available next. Just hands me the card, no "call us to let us know when you're available.." or nothing...  Grrr is all I can say about this place...

It's 2015, what legit business only takes cash or checks? Who carries that with them anymore? I'll take my business elsewhere.
