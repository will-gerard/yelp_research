What a perfect, friendly, tasty meal we had there last night!  The absolute quintessential italian neighborhood kind of place - a little kitchy, a lot tasty, and an inviting staff and warm and friendly owner.   Butternut Squash Ravioli in a brown butter sauce (one of the limited rotating specials) was perfect, and the very large portion of lasagna (at just $13.5) was almost as good as mom's :).  Smallish, quaint, a touch of cheese on the billboard ("As seen on TV") make it a perfect spot for a quiet romantic dinner as well as a group of 6-8.  Larger groups may be challenged as I don't *think* they take reservations - but check on that ....

Truly one of the friendliest hardworking starbucks crews I've ever seen.  Yes they do need to add more tables inside - but the very supportive manager told me she's working on it!  And to those who strike stars because of "drive throughs and global warming" .... you walked here, in 105 degrees, right!? Like global warming, hypocrisy sucks too ...

Love that ALL of our money spent here, while having a ball, goes to supporting local Arts!

Excellent place.  Warm brick walls.  Very knowledgeable foodie-waitress.  Great selection of small plates nicely presented and extensive wine list.  Will def go back numerous times!

It's hard to give 5 stars to a burger joint - but I thought about it.    My only expectations were "expensive" as I had read something about a place with gorgonzola topped Kobe burgers.  I also didn't know if it was sit-down, counter service or what.  And does the "next-to-Barcelona" rub off in any good/bad/ugly way ?      Bottom Line:  A pleasant surprise!  Clean, quick, quaint but modern.  And it is sit down service provided by a friendly staff.  Polite.  Not overly professional but that isn't a bad thing - they sell burgers  .... and sorry to use the phrase but what a burger.  Perfectly cooked.  Anointed with my selections of fixings - most as part of the price - and choice of buns (including wheat).    And what *seems* expensive at $11 for a half pound Kobe burger ($8 for Angus half , $6 for Angus quarter pound), they serve bottomless drinks at a reasonable price ($2), and cheese, veggies, special sauces for covering your burger and a side dish were also included (best sweet potato fries I've ever had).  So in fact the net result was in line.      While I didn't have any, they also have Crab Cakes, Turkey Burger and an Organic Veggie Burger --- so plenty for lite to extreme veggie crowd! Salads and sandwiches all in the $5 - $8 range were also available --- but that's for the 4th or 5th visit.      It's a nice little corner cafe --- good for a quick but tasty bite at lunch, or even a leisurely afternoon (Quality beer on tap and it even looked like martini service - but no I didn't indulge ;-).    And did I say my burger was near perfect?  Cheers

Keep it simple to avoid being harassed by the sandwhich nazis.  Just not a good place to eat.

CLOSED Quality always-being-tweaked menu, attentive staff and hands on management.  Upscale yet still reasonably priced - and friendly !  Gorgeous rib eyes, best Veal dish ever (chef's special - not on menu yet) and my favorite burger in the state (on-premises hand ground best-of-class beef).  Yup it's true.  Beats even the excellent Blu Burger, and Zinc Bistro offering.  Fresh made buns, large single fried onion, thick, tasty, juicy - just perfect.  Haven't tried it yet, but going back for their new Sea Bass FIsh n Chips.  Heard rave reviews from other guests over it.  Excellent views across the FH lake to the "world famous" ;-) fountain - bound to go off at least once during your meal - even lit up at night.  Will extend this review with more time and visits - but it's a nice change of pace and just a couple of minutes off of Shea.

One of the rare "deserves every single 5 start review" places on Yelp.  Carmel truffles?  Sublime!   Red Velvet Chocolate Bon Bons? Extraordinary!! Think that's incredible - try the Dark Chocolate ones.  Best. Gift. Ever. for under $100 (seriously!) YUM.

Wow - great live jazz venue.  Desperately needed in AZ and boy did they deliver!  Large yet intimate feeling club side was packed - yet manager found small stage-side seats for 2nd act and all but refused the tip for doing so (I insisted).  Food (appetizers and wine only  - will go back and provide more on this soon) was excellent.  Service was a bit "odd" on the restaurant side, but more from trying too hard and training newbies.  I can't say enough about what a pleasant surprise this place was.  But be *sure* and make reservations for the club side.  Live music 5 days a week per the owner/singer (whose quite hot btw ;-)

Busy corner, valet required, but a perfect casual and tasty place for a mid-week business lunch.  Very accommodating (changes requested for 2 of 3 dishes at table) and nothing but solid positive comments from all parties I was with.  Friendly, quick very pleasant service too.  I'll go back.

Perfect light meal, accommodating to carnivores and veggies.  Excellent service on the patio - great place to dine 8 months a year.  Really nothing you can say wrong about the place.  Dessert menu looked incredible, perhaps a touch pricey.  4 visits here - all of great value and similar service.

Great coffee, service-oriented staff who really seems to enjoy their customers and working there, and a very cool retro-but-not-over-the-top vibe, including a "recycled" back patio just opening up.  Baked goods made fresh on premises include to die for brown butter as well as blueberry scones.  And perfect, generous sized (and reasonably priced!) quiche if you need more substance.  Free wifi, good music mix and very entertaining owner (say hi to Pat when you come in - you'll know who he is) makes it a very frequent stop!

Pretty wonderful 1st try.  Empty at lunch, but that means the chef took time to come out and chat.  Knows his way around the kitchen *and* Europe.  Between the true italian sense and flavors, and great beer list, it's a must return.  Bringing a group on Friday!

Hands down one of the most consistent yet unique, romantic dining spots in Greater Phoenix. Many visits, never disappointed, and more than once service WAY beyond expectations .  Literally an impromptu tasting when it was an otherwise slow summer night, and another night the pressed clean shirt straight from the GM, when I blew it with my red wine covering my white shirt, was beyond belief. My fault and yet they somehow still made it an amazing experience without embarrassing me one iota. That's class. That's service. And it's innovative 5-star food on top of that!

I hardly ever can give a 5 star for a restaurant that's very good to great ... As this one can be.  I've been to true 5 stars and they're sublime. And expensive. This is neither. And I love it!  Homemade pasta is excellent, as well as their drink service which includes made-in-house libations. Excellent, creative salads too.  Get a Happy Hour pizza and drink at the lively bar, and you'll feel like you scored a yearly bonus.  Local. Fresh. Authentic. Creative. At reasonable prices to boot.  SOLID 4 star.

Open till 1 AM on a Saturday? Um. Chk the times they are Actually NOT open. Height of tourist season and at 12:30 AM it's clear they've been closed for quite some time. Either Yelp needs to tell a better story, and or restaurants owners a better truth? Either way it pretty much is a lousy way to promote your restaurant ...

Wonderful, friendly and ORGANIC! shakes, soft service and unusual ice cream concoctions.  A no brainer place to stop for something sweet. Plenty of parking just next door too. Luv it!
