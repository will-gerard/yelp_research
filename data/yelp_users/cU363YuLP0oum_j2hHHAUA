I have parked exclusively at Preflight for more than 8 years, nearly every week.  the stays have normally been 3 to 4 days, but as long as 2 weeks.  there's a speed pass option to avoid the pay window on exit, and auto-pay, allng eigh a great frequent parker program.   Juan, Steve, Julio and Eddie are favorites, but every one if them have been fast, friendly and professional.   thanks @preflightphx

Kimmy and the staff couldn't be any nicer or more accommodating.   No appointment needed, but call.ahead and get your name in, especially if you have a specific person to see.  When Kim isn't available, ask for Lori.

With every $25 gift card you get a free med popcorn.  Upgrade it to a large for $1 and you get a free refill.  Save your bag for the next move.  You get 2 larges for a dollar.  Use your gift card to pay for your movie and drinks....even the $1.  The gift that keeps on giving.

Food was ok, over priced and poor service.  Check your bill for happy hour pricing...it's not automatic.  You have to ask.
