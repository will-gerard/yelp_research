This place is pretty cool. Went for the first time today since some buddies from work took me down here. I was kinda excited from the beginning but it was even more awesome than I imagined. Great ambience, lots of TV's, wall art, concert posters, sports stuff everywhere, themed waiters. How cool? Not sure how the food is overall because I've only been once but everything looked pretty solid. I ordered the "Big Unit" because that's like the staple thing to get here and that's what my friends told me to get so I did. I knew this thing was big from the beginning but damn, when it comes out you seriously feel like Adam from Man vs Food. This thing is 22 inches of really thick all-beef hot dog on a baguette roll and it is a real task to try and finish. I wasn't able to because I ate too much before, not knowing I would be taking on a food warrior. They ring a bell and everyone yells "Big Unit" as they walk it out. Very fun place, I would definitely return again. Service moderate and prices up there a bit but overall very fun place to go before a game or just if you're downtown at all. Will return eventually and update with more info next time!

I personally love this Taco Bell. It's right outside of my work so can get a quick meal whenever I have a break and just relax in their nice old school dinning room. I may even go a little too often as the counter people are starting to recognize me lol. I was going to give this three stars until I found out they serve breakfast now too! It's doesn't start until 8am for all you extra early people, but Taco Bell didn't open until 10am before this, so it's still an upgrade. Great location too in a nice sizeable shopping center with lots of other food and retail options!

Okay so 1 star right away just for being Target. Add a 2nd star for having a Starbucks and Pizza Hut Express. Add a 3rd star because the store was just remodeled! Add star 4 for having a sizeable grocery section with fresh food!  I was gonna give it a solid 4 stars because this Target is fresh, has lots of food choices, a Pharmacy, the great food court with Pizza Hut Express and Starbucks, and plenty of friendly Team Members that have never failed to ask me if I need help, but the fact that this Target is open til 11pm rather than the typical 10pm closing time for Target, that my friends just bought star #5! That extra hour is seriously invaluable seeing as I often get off at 10pm and need to buy groceries and other essentials after work. Add in how incredible the location is with Costco and Fry's in the same lot and I'd give it six stars if I could. Love the Arcadia Target along with the whole shopping corner it's in!

This really is America's Friendliest Airport! Always great service everywhere you turn here and very user friendly. I love it here and maybe I'm a bit biased now that I live here but I lived in Las Vegas for 24 years and I really don't care for that airport so maybe not biased?! Even before I lived here in Phoenix I always appreciated it here because once you're past the security checkpoint, EVERYTHING is connected. People complain about the long walkways but really I'd rather have a long, air conditioned connector with a moving walkway then have to leave security and comeback through just to have a shorter walk! I've never had to connect flights at this airport but I know how much of a pain that can be if you have to leave a secure area to get to another set of gates.   The roads in and out of the terminals are great and simple to understand with a cell phone lot on each end which I think is a big deal, makes things simpler. They also just finished the PHX Sky Train (see review) from Metro rail and parking so getting in and out of the airport core is now even simpler. Also has a future extension being built to T3 right now so just in case you do need to switch terminals, this will greatly simplify things for you as well. It really seems like in general they are always trying to improve Sky Harbor and that's what I love about it most. My biggest complaint is that things were becoming run down and old but even that they are changing quickly by remodeling restrooms, laying new carpet, replacing all old signs with new, easier to read, streamlined blue and silver signs.   Myself I know that I can't wait for friends and family to fly in or me fly out just so I can use this great airport we have here. With all the new improvements there is little not to love here, especially once the Sky Train is complete and serves T3 and the Rental Car Center, all bus shuttles will be eliminated and T2 will eventually be closed and things will be simple, cool, and efficient at Sky Harbor. Until then they are always working to reach that pinnacle of big city airport perfection, and it really shows.

This is probably my faviorite Target that's not a full SuperTarget. It was once a Greatland Target, though even though they took the name off the building after the remodel, it still has a basic Grealtand layout with straightline checkouts and two entrances. I can't stand the stores that have the checkouts stacked where you have to squeeze by people to get to the back checklane, so I love that this Target has 18 checklanes straight across the front from one exit to the other. Big points for having two entrances also, it just makes it easier to shop and you don't have all the cars packed at one door like a normal Target, it's nice and spread out here! Like I mentioned before this location was recently remodled along with almost every other Target in Phoenix to the new pfresh layout. That means they now sell fresh food with an expanded grocery area, similar to a SuperTarget but without the full deli, bakery, etc. Having more food makes this store very convinent and much easier to just be able to make one stop and get just about everything we need. It's also nice having all the other stores around here and the mall just in case you do happen need more after spending two hours here and dropping $500 like it's Monopoly money!  They took out the photo lab in the remodel (boo!), but they still have the Food Avenue with Pizza Hut Express, Pharmacy, and Target Mobile. Although I suppose the grocery is more useful than photo :-/ Overall, very awesome Target location, always clean, and usually enough checklanes open too!   Pharmacy, Food Court, Grocery is on left entrance and Guest Service, Electronics, Home is on right entrance. Happy shopping!

This is a very "ghetto" Target if you will. It is small, sort of dirty, has a cramped front end to check out, and is the only Target Store in Las Vegas with no store services. Not even a Pizza Hut Express or Starbucks. The merchandise selection lacks too. I would never give a Target less than three stars, but this one really let me down. I guess part of the problem is the part of town and it was one of the first three Targets in Las Vegas, built back in 1987. Unfortunately, if you live on this side of town, this is your ONLY Target for miles in any direction, and none of the other stores are any better, they're all more rundown and cramped than this.

I know, I know, five stars seems a little steep for fast food place like this, but it really deserves it. You figure we rate a business based on how good it is thinking of what the best it can be is. This place always has hot, great tasting food, served with a smile and it's always fast. Super clean inside, always consistent. It's pretty much the same few employees and they start to recognize you after a while. Mmmmm just talking about them in this review makes me want to go get some chili cheese fries!

MIX 94.1 was my favorite radio station for years. I still love MIX and Mark & Mercadies in the Morning, but I took one star off because they seem to have this problem with playing the same 20 or so songs over and over all day long, everyday. Upside to this is that they do have something called "Pick the Mix" on their website at mix941.fm which really seems to have some pull with the music line-up. They sponser a bunch of really great events too.

Don't be fooled by the part of town this location is in as it's one of the worst ones in town. As having worked for Coca-Cola and having to go in to multiple Walmart locations because of my job I've seen the worst of the worst. This location has poor service as do all other locations, they do not handle produce well in the backroom. They leave meat deliveries out for several hours, far longer than what is healthy and required, and the people that shop here are mostly dirty and not taken care of, and quite obnoxious and loud. Avoid this at all costs and go to Target Greatland or Fresh & Easy for groceries which are cheaper than Walmart GURANTEED, go price compare for yourself, you'll be shocked at how much you've been lied to by Walmart, they really are NOT the cheapest around, check for yourself.

I was really trying to avoid this, I don't like giving bad reviews. This is the 4th time I've been to this location in about a month and every single time it's taken upwards of 10 minutes to check out here. There is always a line whether it's 8am or midnight. It's frustrating to run in for one thing and ALWAYS have to wait that long. I've never seen them open another line either. The cashiers are really friendly, I'll give them that, but have no sense of urgency. Two stars for being open 24 hours, just not worth the wait though. I'll drive the extra mile to the CVS on Broadway if I need anything after 10pm.

Great Taco Bell location overall. Typical Taco Bell food you would expect, always hot and delicious. It's the staff that makes this location though. I'm lucky to live within walking distance, but I would go out of my way to come here if I was heading for the Bell. They were out of a flavor of one of the Limeade Sparklers, and the employee was kind enough to upgrade my size for free as an apology. Great service, employees are always fast and friendly and go out of their way to take care of you. What more can you ask for from a Taco Bell?!

Great lunch specials and daily $.99 items. Always a great meal. Love this and all Filiberto's but this one is walking distance from my place and is open 24 hours soooooo, yeah. What more could anyone really ask for? Typical food, you all know what their food is all about, but I really like this location. Not just because it's super close and I can get great Mexican food at any hour of the day, the inside is unique. They have a few fun games and a bigger than average seating area if you need a cheap, good place to eat at 3am! I love fresh Mexican food, especially late at night. Thank goodness we live in Arizona, and 3 minutes from this gem!

Las Vegas Wrangler Hockey baby! Been coming to the games myself since 2007, I saw an ad on TV for the annual midnight hockey game and the rest is history! It's always a great value, fun to hang out and cheer on the local ice hockey team, and Duke is pretty awesome himself too! For the most part the team has been pretty good and wins quite often which helps for sure lol. Bring your friends, bring your family, bring everyone, the more the merrier defenitly applies here. The games are usually more full on the weekends, the Tuesday games are more lax. Word of advice: come when they play Alaska Aces, those games are always wayyyy more awesome because the two teams hate each other. More often you come, the more you will want to come to the next game! Learn the chants and get into it! My only complaint is the crowds are a little small sometimes, but that's not theteams fault, it's the flaky people in this city. So come on out! We have all four big sports between the UNLV Runnin' Rebels (basketball), two-time champs Las Vegas Locos (football), the Las Vegas 51's (Triple A baseball) and our very own Las Vegas Wrangler hockey team (the Phoenix Coyotes are the parent NHL club to us). So come on out and support the Las Vegas community and be a part of our great city. You're gonna have a good time!

Honestly, I love Target, so I really mean it if I give a Target store this low of a rating. If all Target stores were like this one, I would NOT shop at Target. Seriously, and the district office is at this location... you'd think it would be their showcase store! This was the first Target in Las Vegas (1987), so i"ll give them that, but c'mon, time to upgrade! The isles are narrow, pillars are in really weird annoying places and block checkout lanes, the Food Avenue team members and VERY slow to service, even the department signs are the old ones with the block color. They really need to just level the entire store and build a brand new SuperTarget on top it's remains, until then, I'd tell you to drive the extra mile to another Target.

I love the Las Vegas Monorail, probably a little more than I should. The matter of fact is that this four mile stretch of track is the best thing this city has, and most important. It saddens me that the middle leg was built first, I truely wish they had started phase 1 or 3 first to the airport or to Fremont Street. Everyone is already on The Strip, they want to get to these ends, but oh well, it may never happen at this point because this city has no forward thinkers but anyway. The monorail is the most invaluble asset in this city. It's the only completly dependable bet anywhere near Las Vegas Blvd and we desperately need it. No matter if it's a weekend and Strip traffick is completely jammed or if there is an accident on I-15, the monorail will always without fail get you from Tropicana Ave to Sahara Ave in 15 minutes, no matter what. That's the most important fact people always lookover. You can't put a price on dependability like that when you have somewhere to be and a time to be there at. Hopefully it at least goes to Fremont Street eventually seeing as that is where all the masses of people are always off to, which you would know if you ever ride the Strip & Downtown Express or Deuce to and from Fremont/The Strip. Until then if you ride the monorail to Sahara Station and take the escalator to street level, directly to your left you will see the station platform for the SDX. It's not too bad on a busy weekend if you are trying to get between The Strip and downtown as nothing will get you out of the mess on Las Vegas Blvd faster than the monorail, and from Sahara the Strip & Downtown Express only makes three additional stops before you get to Fremont Street then it continues on to the Outlet Mall and new downtown. I like to this of this as the temporary monorail extension if you will. If you have an event at the Las Vegas Convention Center, then the monorail really is second to none in this case. If you're staying at any property on the east side of The Strip then a tree day pass would do you wonders! To your convention, back to the hotel, out to dinner or a show, back to your hotel. It'll be worth it for you people, I promise. Now if only it took you back to the airport too.....       My point is this city needs this service and I hope it is here and extended for decades to come. I use it to get to work at MGM Grand and I can't believe how many times it has got me to work in time when I would have been late because of an accident of the 15 or a major even getting out blocking you from parking. I'm thankful we have this. Lets hope phase 1 and 3 happen someday so we can all rest a little better.

I'm a fan of Target because I always know what to expect. This Target Greatland was built in 2002, has a easy sales floor layout with blue, green, and red "worlds" and two entrances with 22 straight checkout lanes across the front make sure you are always a short trip from car to cart to checkout and back. Store services includes only a Pharmacy, (the One Hour Photo was recently removed) and the Food Avenue has no Pizza Hut Express or Starbucks. This location also has a small grocery selection compared to the new upgraded Target stores. Overall though, a very clean, well designed store, easy to shop, so long as you just need the basics. I would prefer to shop at a Target with more food, as that is what I primarily purchase form Target. Very accesible parking from Sky Pointe Drive on the south, Buffalo Drive from the north, and John Herbert to the west.     A few quick tips I've compiled over the last year or so, to give everyone a "real" experience lol....  Get the Target REDcard! You get 5% off every single purchase, every single time! There's a debit option too for those that don't want credit  Switching to Sprint and getting a new phone @ Target Mobile!  Coke products only $2.50/12 pack!  Doritos on sale $1.90/bag!  Market Pantry milk $2.69/gal  Humidifiers on clearance for $9! Super cheap! In the back of blue world.  Food Avenue popcorn!  Picking up Chips, chili and Velveta cheese for a chili cheese dip before the big UNLV game!  REALLY good valentine section, check it out on the right side. Towards the back in green world :-)  Doritos and bean dip for the UNLV game party on TV!  Market Pantry Orange Juice on sale, only $1.99!  Picking up mailing supplies. Cheaper than the post office.  Picking up eggs and cake mix for my wife's egg salad and cake pops :-)  Target Pharmacy is open 9am-9pm weekdays, open late on weekends too. Really helpfull Pharmacy staff!  Great place to stop by and pick up snacks for get-togethers. I've been in here 8 times this week just to get chips, frozen chicken and soda!

This Kohl's was built while I was still in high school over at Centennial and that was the first time I had ever heard of Kohl's. My love for this store has grown over the years and this store is very consistant, even now, 7 years later, it is still the same layout, and service ast the day it opened. I can always expect to find a beyond incredible deal when I walk in here, and nothing less. Their slogan "Expect Great Things" is true as can be. So next time I need new khaki pants and only have $12, I'll head over to Kohl's and odds are, I'll find what I need for less. And my fondness for you continues on Kohl's...

This store is VERY dirty, wayyyy too busy, only 3 lanes open on a Monday afternoon with about 15 people in each line. Even the Target Greatland across the freeway had more lanes open with 5, and they arent even a SuperTarget with grocery like this hell-hole is!You can't park because EVERYONE just walks right in front of you and the stupid employees decide right in front of the main entrance door is where they want to bitch about people that shop and spend their money to support their job. I don't think I'm ever going to Hell-Mart again, I'll save my self trouble AND money by purchasing my groceries at Target and Fresh & Easy.

This is hands down my favorite ballpark I've ever been too. There is nothing like Chase Field at an Arizona Diamondback game. The roof is AMAZING! What a genious idea! A/C in a baseball stadium?! There's a game to play, but it's 110° outside... close the roof and turn on the A/C! Haha! It is really spectacular to watch as well when the roof is in motion. Every seat is great, the food prices are high, but now include a value menu, light rail station right out front to get you on your way and free of traffic. Almost no flaws at all. Even ticket prices are reasonable. Like I've said, nothing like a ballgame at Chase Field. Everyone should be here once before they die.

Probably the best mid-size I've been to, and the nicest in Las Vegas, even though it is the smallest of them all. Seats about 9,000 for ice hockey. Very comfortable, REALLY clean restrooms, short concessions, the prices are average, though the tickets are often super reasonable for any event. That is what is so great about this place, we've seen everything here from hockey to basketball to arena football, great concerts, even high school graduation. They seriously do it all. Parking is easy with a garage and an outdoor lot, exit to the casino or out either side to the parking lot. If you havent been here yet, check out a Wrangler game or go see a show. Gurantee you'll like it!

I really can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. In-N-Out is near and dear to my heart. This is a five star burger joint for a few specific, simple reasons.  1. They are open til 1am inside, which is awesome, especially after getting out of a sporting event late at night with friends.  2. A Double-Double is an American Classic and one damn good cheeseburger, nothing beats it.  3. They have the simplest menu on earth, which means the food is incredibly fresh because all they make is burgers and french fries, which happen to be the most perfect combination ever.  Yeah, it's pretty straight forward here. There is nothing better than a Double Double with a handful of their fresh cut fries washed down with a shake or ice cold Dr Pepper or Coke. Theyre open late, the food is amazing, and incredibly affordable. You can easily get meals for two people for $10. There's a reason any location you go to is always busy. We all love In-N-Out, and luckily we live on the west coast so we can enjoy it whenever we feel!

This is my favorite mall in the greater Phoenix region by far and the reason being is that beside being very new and very nice, it has almost everything here! That's the way a mall should be. The layout is fantastic, instead of having one really long corridor, it makes a "Y" kind of shape with everything leading to food court, which leads outside into a seamless connection with the restaurant area which leads right into the Harkins movie theater. The design and thought that went into the simplicity of how everything connects is perfect. I also love the architecture here, they have extra high beams and slanted roofs that are very appealing to the eye. On top of all that the selection of stores I believe is above average and the food court has a great variety and a large, very spacious seating area. This is THE mall to go to, even if you're not in the area it's worth it to make the extra drive here. Very convienent too right off both the 101 and 202 freeways.

When we moved to Phoenix this past January from Las Vegas, my number one excitement factor, aside from Dbacks Baseball, was that I would finally have a light rail system of my own in the city I call home. That sounds better than I thought it would! We specifically chose a place to live that was close to the Metro rail line, and in a general central kinda location so that other transit options and various fun would always be close by. We found ourselves one mile from the Priest Dr and Washington stop.I've always been a fan of light rail and transit in general, but yeah, it does go a little slower than I hoped as I was imagining for those of you that have been there, most of the outer area TRAX lines in Salt Lake City that run fairly fast and in their own right of way. I can only hope that the west Phoenix Metro extention is chosen to follow the I-10 right-of-way and follow the middle of the freeway that is already open and waiting for rail so at least some parts of the line will run over 40 MPH.      On that note, yes, I do truely love this system and believe that it is an asset to this city and look forward to the day that it builds out more. For now it is nice to be able to leave the car behind and ride a bike to a station and not deal with any traffic at all, and it is VERY nice to be able to hop on after a Diamondback or Suns game or any other big event downtown and know we will be home in 10-15 minutes rather than wait in a parking garage for 30 minutes alone.       Prices are very affordable, only $2.00 one way or $4.00 for the whole day, you really can't beat that price!

I'm not real sure why people are so hard on this place. We don't have Golden Corral in Las Vegas where I'm from, we just have casino buffets so that's all I have to compare it to. I thought the food here was really above par though. It was good, afforable, quality food, with great service and I'm not quite sure what more you can ask for. Will I be coming back here? Yes, absolutely, probably monthly!   P.S.- The rolls are incredible and taste homemade like they just came out of your grandma's oven!

Okay, I know, I know. I do love Target, but this is a SuperTarget and I love that even so much more!    I really do wish all Target stores were built as the incredible SuperTarget format rather than the small single entry locations with "p-fresh". I'm glad they beefed up the food section at all the smaller Target stores, but they still pale in comparison to a full SuperTarget!      The "p-fresh" locations don't have a fresh bakery inside with the most amazing and decadent pastries and treats you've ever tasted! They also don't have a fresh service deli with the most tender and flat out best crispy chicken you've ever found, and they also don't have rows and rows of fresh deli sandwiches and perfectly placed produce. I also like how these locations all have the straight checklanes with the two entrances as opposed to the stacked checklanes at regular Targets.     If you haven't yet been to a SuperTarget yet, then I seriously suggest you take a peek and see what it's all about, because it really is something special. The prices on food are seriously low AND they price match any local ad if you do happen to find something cheaper. I wouldn't quite go so far as to say this is the best grocery store in town seeing as I still haven't been to AJ's and Sprouts which I hear locals rave about, but I will at least say it is hands down the best all around of the chain grocery stores. And please don't even make me say it, but if there is a SuperTarget right across the street from a Will-you-just-shoot-me-in-the-head-now-Mart Supercenter, then why would you even consider going into that filthy death trap. Lower prices, clean floors and sanity are waiting to greet you across the street!      I don't have SuperTarget where I'm from (Las Vegas), so I beg of you to not take for granted what we do have here! I make my wife drive 16 miles with me just to do our full grocery shop trip here and it truely is worth it! Don't forget the 5% off you get also with your REDcard! NO, I don't work for Target marketing, I just love saving money and shopping in a fun neon-filled store whwere everyone is friendly and I can leave with tasty things :-)   SuperTarget! Just look for the green script with the green dash under the word and you'll know you're home!

This Target is very interesting. It has the standard new red look inside but there's just something different about it I can't quite tell. I like that it has 16 checklanes, it seems like most Target stores only have 12 now. Those four extra could make a big difference come Christmas time. I'm a little disappointed they took the photo lab out, but all in all it is a very nice, well maintained Target. This location still has the typical Pharmacy, Starbucks, Pizza Hut Express with the Target food court.   I'd have to say that what Sue said is not very credible though. I've never had any problem with boxes being in the way and the team members have always been very helpful. And with the having to walk far issue Sue mentioned, this Target is set up like a Costco where the parking wraps the front entrance at the corner. I've seriously never been more than a few steps away from the door, the Garden Center was MUCH further.   I'm primarily writing this review to speak about how great the employees are here! I went with my wife and mother in law to purchase a crib on sale with a free mattress. Another Target sent us here but this store had only one of the two items. The team members here searched other locations and even went above and beyond and called the other location to have the items held for us. I've always had a great experience when shopping at this Target, they have a really fantastic staff which makes a world of difference.  I really recommend this Target store to anyone in this area, please don't let Sue's review keep you from this shopping nirvana!

This is by far the worst theater in the valley. I so badly wanted to like this theater based on it's prime location downtown and with close proximity to Metro light rail but it's just not worth your time, money, or sanity.   -BOX OFFICE You can tell you're going to have a poor experience from the moment you get to the box office. This location has a huge, beautiful box office with 12 windows to speed you into your movie, a great idea for a 24 screen theater but no, half of the box office is permanently closed. Windows 1-6 are essentially abandoned so that leaves you with only 6 windows for 24 theatres. It's bad enough the box office is lacking but to make matters even worse they don't even use their box office! The entire box office is closed with a temporary sign that asks you to go inside to customer service to purchase tickets.  -BUYING TICKETS When you get inside you find that customer service is actually a tiny cut out in the wall with one single register as if it was an afterthought and there are no movie showtimes in this area. It's bad enough not knowing what time you need for a movie or even what's playing but just think about how you're standing behind a line of people that also doesn't know. To make matters worse, their 3 or 4 automated ticket machines are all broken. It looks as if two were removed and the other two have Out of Order signs up. So at this point were down to ONE register for TWENTY-FOUR theatres. Oh yeah, and your "box office" employee is also you're ticket taker. Sounds really cheap, you could seriously just walk right in.  -CUSTOMER SERVICE This category is non existent. The customer service employee we were forced to purchase our tickets from was going on a lengthy conversation with the college girls in front of us with no regard to the line behind them. (I don't like judging places by the action of one employee but is often reflects how the business is run.) The service is no different at the concessions. Speaking of...  -CONCESSIONS There are long lines and limited registers open, I'm pretty sure most the other registers are removed anyway. Only one of four popcorn machines were on and employees had zero sense of urgency. Something I don't like about AMC is that they fool you with their prices by not including tax as the rest of the industry does. You go into a purchase thinking you're total will be one price and then you're unexpectedly hit with tax that was left off the individual prices.   -THEATRE QUALITY This part was really poor. Theatre was disgusting, walls are peeling and smell bad and seats are tight and don't move. They're as cheap in this area as they are at the box office and concessions. The theatre was not cleaned before or after our showing. I'm pretty sure they don't have any cleaning crew at all. There were cups and trash left in the theatre from the showing before ours. I really can't stand the AMC brand promos before the movie, they talk to you like you're stupid. Thenagain, you must be if you're at a movie here.  -LOBBY AND COMMON AREA This theater is just lacking love as a whole. All the areas were dirty, and showed their age badly. No one here cleans ANYTHING. I only saw a total of 6 employees, one at the door and 5 at concession. Never saw a manager or security or anyone else. Management or AMC obviously has no desire to invest in their building and it shows. It feels like second run dollar theater but with full prices for everything.   In closing the only reason I could ever imagine seeing a movie here again is if you were in the area without transportation and in that case I'd rather just not see a movie than deal with this place. It's really disappointing with this fantastic location in Arizona center. I would strongly advise to travel to absolutely any other cinema in Phoenix instead of dealing with this one.

I've never been to a small size airport like this before so it's hard to compare it to another airport. I really enjoy the small size of it, makes it unique. There are basically three buildings, you have the front check-in building, the back building behind the courtyard with gates 1-4 and then a middle building to the side with gates 5 and 6 which also has the baggage claim on the other side of the wall.   I personally prefer Sky Harbor because I can ride the light rail straight there, but this airport does have a bus with half hour frequency. Take route 184, Power Road southbound and it drops off right across from the front door. Everyone seems more friendly here too, probably without having the masses wearing them down everyday, the employees here still have a personality lol.   Great low priced fares from Allegiant, good service, resonable food and drink option and it looks like they are expanding for Spirit Airlines to join this fall (2012). Overall a very good experience, I would suggest this airport as an alternative to anyone living out here near Mesa or if you don't mind the hour drive from the West Valley. I will most likely use this airport again.

Super excited to find out this Target now has extended hours! I personally think all Target stores should be open later but for now I will just celebrate that Las Vegas finally has a Target open til 11pm. So first they remodeled and added the "Pfresh" expanded food format, and now this... they're going in the right direction now. I can't believe how many times I've needed to grab something right at about 10:02pm, especially after coming out of a sporting event which usually ends right as Target is closing. Now I can get my groceries here late, I'm happy :-)  There is also a Photo Lab, Portrait Studio, and Pharmacy inside!

I was born and raised in Vegas and really love everything in this town, or at least try to, but we seriously need a COMPLET overhaul of this place and it's staff. I've been to a few Rebel and Loco football games here and they're alright from the seats, but the facitlity from the concorse and the parking lot, ehhh. They need to learn to direct traffic and not be so stupid. I went to finish my drink when walking in the gate, knowing that I'm not allowed to take it inside, and as I go to throw it away, the guy at the gate FREAKS OUT on me and tells me that I HAVE to throw it out in this other trash can on the other side of the table, two feet away. Both trash cans, not like one is recycle or plastics only or something, EXACT same thing. They need to not waste their time on directing people exactly which receptical to use and focus on, gee, i don't know, maybe TRAFFIC or CROWD CONTROL. And PLEASE use the conssesions that you have givien to you built in the stadium, not ONE on each side!!!! For the Locomotive footbal games the UFL did a great job, it was the stadium crew  that dropped the ball. I will try to avoid this place if at all possible.

Who wouldn't love the bigges arena in Las Vegas at 18,500 seats? Seen several events here, particularly basketball (go Rebels!), and I've never really had a problem. Plenty of comfortable seating with padding, prices are usually really affordable, the crowd is amazing and really loud for sports. The only really bad thing is how long it takes to leave sometimes. We like to sit and wait and listen to the post-game show inside, but lately they have been forcing you out fast and you end up sitting in your car for an hour or more. Park at the Maryland and Flamingo garage or ride the ACExpress Rapid Transit here, avoid the post game traffic and you'll have a great time!

I do love Taco Bell and this location is no exception. Usually a little bit slower than the others as it is still newer. Service is about as fast as the location behind Target Greatland on Buffalo.

Maybe it's just because I'm from Las Vegas and we don't have any of the super awesome cool stuff they have here in Phoenix metro, but this place is super awesome! I mean seriously. A movie theater, lots of shops and dinning, fountains and lights everywhere anchored by a huge arena with an awesome Coyotes hockey team inside. What more can you ask for?! Miuns one star because of the location (I'm spoiled, not use to driving more than 15 minutes to anything), and also the selection of stores and restaurants seem a little short. It feels like there is suppose to more to this. Other than that, I'm for sure a fan of this awesomeness!

This and the Chandler Harkins are the best two theaters in Phoenix! This is a very busy, very crowded theater but it never feels like it. They always have multiple box office windows open, six self serve ticket machines, never a wait at the concession counter. Often times I've seen them with every single register running which is beyond appreciated. The special Cine Capri theatre is incredible. The massive screen and premium sound is completely worth it. Every corner of the place is as clean as a hospital, this crew is on top of things. Best part of all is they have extra late showtimes here. It's not uncommon to see a showing as late as 12:40am, you can't beat that. 5+ stars easy. My go to theater no matter what!

So apparently I've never been here when there are hoards of ASU kids like several other reviews mentioned. What I do know is that I've been to this Target a few times now that I live nearby and love it of course. First off, apparently I got really lucky to be living right between two Target stores that are both open to 11pm. As most of us know, Target always closes at 10pm with the exection of only three stores in the valley and I happen to live near TWO of them, awesome! Other than that, this Target is pretty much set up the exact same way they all are now, and includes the expanded fresh grocery section. Not quite a full SuperTarget, but it will do for most grocery trips. They have a Pharmacy and a Photo Counter along with Starbucks and Pizza Hut Express and 18 awesome checklanes with cool ligts to stare at while you wait in line for 15 seconds. I'm glad this is my closest Target, becaust it has everything I need, is open late, and just happens to be in the awesome Tempe Marketplace so I can knock everything out at once.

Five stars because this place is awesome and has a little of everything. Not very many other places can you go with you find a really nice outdoor mall anchored by a movie theater with big box stores surrounding it like Target, Best Buy, and Michaels. The concept is simply perfect. The mall area is very nice and has a pretty good, typical selection of stores with more than plenty to eat and more than enough parking for everything. I love the lasers on Target and Best Buy at night too. It's such a simple pointless effort, but I appreciate it so much. I'm a huge fan of Tempe Marketplace, and and extra plus, it's right off the 202 Red Mountain Freeway. But thenagain, isn't everything in this city off the freeway?

This is one of the nicer Target stores in Las Vegas, lacks store services though as there is only a Pharmacy here. Overall, for a older Target Greatland, this store looks as if it just opened yesterday still. It is always super slow here too, so if you like to shop in peace, you've found your match!

Town Square is just what Las Vegas has been missing all these years. Great mix of shopping, dining, entertainment, and offices above the retail. Some stores are a tad bit pricey, but overall, this is one of the best entertainment centers in the country. I love how you feel like you are in California when you are walking down the beautiful streets, and Rave Motion Pictures is the best movie theater I have ever been too. Defenitly worth the trip if you are visiting Las Vegas or if you live here and haven't discovered it just yet.

I work at the Centennial Costco so I often come here to make purchases rather then going to mine and feeling like I'm at work. I like the are that this Costco is in, very nice shopping center with Best Buy, Borders, Lowes, Burger King, easy access to the 215 beltway. Super, SUPER busy at almost anytime, don't expect to get gas real quick if you're in a hurry, they do a really good job about getting everyone on their way quickly and efficiently though. Only Costco I know of to have Gelato in a waffle cone in the food court, and for a REALLY low price at that! Other than that, it's your typical, busy Costco Wholesale, and very clean. But honestly, don't go on the weekend, save yourself and everyone else the headache!

This is an older Target, built in the early 90's I do believe, but it does serve it's purpose. It's a convenent, easy to shop store, with good service and well-stocked shelves. It includes a Pizza Hut Express inside with the Target Cafe/Food Avenue, and it also has a 1 Hour Photo Lab right up front at the checklanes and a Pharmacy a little bit further down. There's everything any typical Target would have and a nice sized grocery section with the basics. Once it gets a remodel, I'm sure it will become 5 stars!

This may be my favorite SuperTarget in the city for the sole reason that they always have MORE than enough checklanes open and they are always evenly spaced out. I know it sounds silly but it makes it so much easier to checkout. They even open the express lanes on the grocery side often which is nice to have when you only need one thing of milk or some deli chicken!      Thuis SuperTarget like the rest has a Pharmacy, Photo, Optical, Starbucks, Pizza Hut Express, along with an incredible bakery and a super awesome deli with someof the best sandwiches. Oh how I wish they built every single Target as a SUPER Target.

Okay, GREAT price for flights with no frills, good and friendly service, and everything about the trip was efficient. I'm not sure why people rag on Allegiant so much but the service is great, I'm very happy with my experience and would definitely use them again!

This use to be the Target store locals would steer clear of and tourists went because it said "Target" and they just didnt know any better. Finally they came up with the times, got rid of the nasty old shelves and signs, and upgraded with a remodel to the new "Target red" added a Starbucks, adjusted the lanes, expanded the sales floor over where the old Garden Center use to be, and wal-ah! You have a brand new Target again! Close to The Strip if you are a visitor, just a short drive down Flamingo, and great for UNLV students, as it borders the campus. Store includes a Target Pharmacy, Pizza Hut Express in Target Cafe, and Starbucks Coffee.

Maybe I'm just a little harsh because I'm a Vegas local and I'm use to everything being over-the-top, but seriously now that Aliante Station has been open over a year, I'm really let down.        When Aliante first opened in October 2008, we were all really excited to have such a one-stop entertainment destionation on this side of town, which is far underdeveloped commercially. Way to many houses, not enough retail, food, etc. We were initially impressed the first few months. Evrything was open, there was always an excess of lanes and registers everywhere, plenty of employees, the Regal Theaters always had a great selection of showtimes, and the rooms were spectacular for an off-Strip hotel. The last time we stayed at the hotel in December 2009, the rooms had gone downhill from our previous stay in February 2009. Lights were out, buttons and knobs were broken, the mini fridge had pieces falling off and was not stocked, and the HD TV sevice was no more. On top of all that, there was only one person at check-in and check out each time, and the were usually preoccupied.      As for the casino side which we visit more often (or use to), since the opening, Dunkin Dounts has closed, the hours at most the food places have been shortened, the Regal theaters have horrible showtimes now, it is almost always more convient to just make the extra drive to another theater. There are never enough tables open, never more than one cashier window open, and the WORST part is that the often only have THREE floors open in the parking garage out of SIX. HALF of the entire parking garage is closed. Why even build it?!?! I suppose I'm just spoiled living in Las Vegas my whole life and having parking plentiful, but the parking situation was a dealbreaker for me, and I'm one of those people that doesn't mind having to walk a medium distance from car to front door. It is stupid to me when the garage is full, so we are forced to drive the wrong way up the down ramp just to find any space, besides the 60 handicap spaces on level 3. (Level 1 is employee and Valet, and Level 2 is mostly reserved for high level casino card members), so you can see my frustration. Just let us drive up to level 6, no traffic to fight, enjoy a nice view on my way in, and get on with our night.       In closing, the enitre property is brand new, and most of it really nice, but until they figure out what the word "service" means, I'll be taking my buisness to somewhere that is actually prepaired for customers. Unless you enjoy waiting in lines on a Saturday night where only one person is staffed at the movie box office and concessions, and where staff is so thin else where to the point that all you can do is watch from a distance other people having a good time, I would advise you to think twice, take the extra drive, and go elsewhere as well.

This place is amazing! My wife and I live in Las Vegas but went here with her family living in the San Tan Valley. Drove by this place a few times with her family and never really noticed, but we finally stopped in this time. Food was amazing, taste great, made fresh in the back, real good quality mexican food. Like the other reviews said, this place really is a little hole in the wall shack off the side of the road in farm land, but that's how you know it's good. From what I'm told, they just added that little covered outdoor area to sit at, and are now open on Sundays. If you live anywhere in Central Arizona you have to go try this place out! -1 star for the friendliness. The workers were a little reserved the whole time, the did freak out on me though for bringing in a QT drink even though it had like two ounces left. I understand the no outside drink policy, but I was going to order one anyway. Beside that, everything was great!

The service here is amazing! I've always been a fan of of Lowes but this one has really won me over. Been in here two seperate occasions, one was in the garden center and the other was inside. Both times I was offered help by several employees and when I did need it I was given very specific, clear information and even asked if I needed them to walk over to that section with me!  Aside from the great service their prices and policies are amazing! I believe they back all their live plant purchases with a lifetime guarantee plus My Lowes online which tracks all your purchases so you never forget what you had if you need more or lose a reciept! I will be shopping here almost exclusively. Great all around!

Excuse my language but this place is such a massive shithole. Haven't been to Wal-Mart in a few years because well, why would you? Finally went to this one last night by request of someone I know and I just couldn't take it after a few minutes, I left my cart down some isle and booked it as fast as I could out of there. Sorry, I just can't take the people sitting on the floor everywhere, everyone screaming at each other, walking 1 mph if not slower, pallets blocking all the isles in the middle of the day. PASS!

Let me start by saying I live in Las Vegas but after shoping here several different occations, my wife and I would KILL for a SuperTarget back home, especially this one! The team members are super friendly here. Asked about a particular muffin over at the bakery and even though they did not carry that kind anymore, I wasn't even upset after having a nice conversation with the woman in that area. She struck up conversation and threw in some facts and asked how our drive was over the new Hoover Dam bridge. She could have just said "no" and moved along, but she went the extra mile that makes shopping at Target an always pleasant experience. Aside from that, SuperTarget is always clean, well stocked, brightly lit, and never too crowded, but doesn't feel like an errie ghost town either. And even though I don't care and would grocery shop here no matter what, I went across the street to the Walmart Supercenter one day to price compare a few things to shut up my friends, and SuperTarget more times than was actually cheaper than walmart. So let's see.... at SuperTarget people are friendlier, it is cleaner, there are not 900 carts and screaming children in your way, it is always stocked full, AND it's cheaper than walmart! Why would anyone ever consider going to poomart when they have a SUPER Target right there?! Not to mention the store has really fresh produce that always looks as if it were just placed out for you alone to see and look in awe. This location has a Photo Lab, Target Optical, a Pharmacy, Starbucks, Pizza Hut Express, full service deli and bakery, and 28 lanes to speed you on your way, literally! I've never waited in line more than like 35 seconds! Even found fresh oregano that my mother-in-law couldn't find at Frys or walmart. Do yourself a favor and GO HERE! Check it out! All SuperTarget stores are awesome, but this one has that extra little bit that makes the trip more than just a chore or errand. I love the Gilbert SE SuperTarget and promise you will too!

What could possibly be better than a brand new Target Store? A brand new Target Store with fresh food! This is the nicest Target I've been to in recent memory. It is well lit with wide isles and all the other typical things you would expect from Target, plus is has a large grocery store sized section with fresh produce, meat, and bakery items, but is not a full SuperTarget. (Currently there is not a SuperTarget in Nevada) The selection is right and the food prices are very competitive. The store is really easy to get to, right off the 215, and has a large unshared parking lot in a brand new shopping center still under construction. The store is one of the first 25 in the country with the new expanded food format, also known as Prototype-Fresh P2009. If you live nearby or are in the area, make sure to stop by and compare prices on food, it is really worth it. On top of being able to get just about any grocery item possible, the store has a new Pharmacy, Photo, Starbucks and Target Cafe with Pizza Hut Express. The store is really worth the drive, I will be going back tomorrow for my groceries! Really the only thing better than this awesome new store would be a full SuperTarget, but this will do for now. I'm in love!

I'm pretty sure if you've already been to a Fresh & Easy, then you love it as much as I do. It seems as if F&E is finally catching on because it continues to be busier and busier every time I come here! I've noticed this location is much busier than the one in Centennial Gateway on Ann Rd. This store always comes through for me and the more I shop here, the more I love it. So many great pre-made, fresh meals that actually taste good! They're also installing in-store bakeries with fresh goodies mmmmm. Between Fresh & Easy and Target, there is no other store I ever need again! Give it a try if you still haven't been here, odds are you'll love it!

I like Fresh & Easy and this one is no different. Just recently opened in March 2010, it's the most recent location in Vegas. Same basic selection, nice friendly staff with your usual self-check out, never a wait. Prices are pretty good, better than the grocery stores. Lots of yummy, fresh food, $.98 produce packs, and ground beef $1.99/lb. when purchased in a 2 lb. pack. Between this and Target I can get my groceries at the best prices. Nice big parking lot, stop by Smashburger out front on your way in too!

Okay, so I don't even know where to start with this one because this store really is that incredible. If you've lived in Las Vegas for awhile then I'm sure you've traveled or vacationed to other places only to return home and wonder to yourself: "why don't we have any of those cool things they have in ____", well now, we finally have one of those places!         Glazier's Food Marketplace, aside from how freakin' cool it is, is also one of those things this city has been in need of for quite some time. In the midst of all the typical chain grocery stores like Smith's, Albertsons, Vons, ther was never really anything that stood out before, which makes Glazier's a breath of fresh air.       When you first walk in the door you can see rows of fresh produce directly in front of you, but turn to your left and you can immediately see what makes this store different. They have an open market-style feel with fresh pizza, deli, gelatto bar, fresh coffee, sushi and other fish. Turn to your right and there is a self-serve salad bar with a plethora of toppings. Walking towards the back there is a bakery to your left, a full service deli salad counter to your right, a huge sausage ad meats counter in the back with all kinds of fresh cuts. Next to that there is a seafood counter with a wide selection and they even steam your crab for free! Just before your make the last turn to the right to head to the grocery isles there is a deli meats and cheese counter and this is what tops the list. To order your sandwhich meats and cheeses you first walk up to a kisok, choose what you want as much as you like, touch the screen to submit your order and it prints you out a reciept to take along with an order number and you can choose to have it text you when your order is complete! If you decide to wait while they work, there are screens that tell you which of the four stations are working on your order and you can watch your meats sliced fresh! It's nice for busy people to not have to wait at the counter all night on someone that has no idea what they want, because the most time consuming part of the process is moved out to a kiosk. Best idea ever in a grocery store. That wraps up the open market syle area with classy neon signs along the walls and a seating area with a live piano playing while you have a bite to eat.       As you go down the rest of the grocery isles, you can tell there is a much wider selection of things you wouldn't find in a typical grocery store. All kinds of specialty items so unique, and hard to find, like chocolate soda lol. The prices on some of these things are a little higher than other stores, but you cannot beat the prices they have on fresh food. Glazier's has rows and rows of fresh, in-house prepaired food for you to take home and use or finsh. Their pastries section is unrivaled in selection and price. The best part of all is when time came to check out, they had all 8 of their checklanes open and four more express self checkout lanes bringing the total to 12. How often do you see ANY store with 100% of their checklanes open? Yeah.       I could literally ramble on all day about how amazing this grocery is, but all I can really say is to go check it out for yourself. When you do go, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to wonder through the store. You are guranteed to find something you will love, but giver yourself the time to see it all. We didn't have enough time to take it all in, though I already can't wait to go back and check it out again. It's 24 miles from my house in Centennial Hills but plan on making the trip frequently as I know it will be worth it. This city is lucky to have such a wonderful, local store to shop for food. This is a very unique place and everyone in this city is missing out if you don't go. Thank you for opening this Mr. and Mrs. Glazier, retirement is overrated anyway lol.

One of the nicest Target stores in town! It is one of the new "P-Fresh" locations, so it has fresh food, produce, meat, and other grocery items. It's actually the lowest prices on food I've seen around. Bananas are usually only $.15 per each! It's got the typical Pharmacy, Photo, Pizza Hut Express, Starbucks. Always seems to be lots of lanes open. Opened in Oct. 2009, and it defenitly shows. Nice to be in the newest Target in Vegas!

this store started out nice, but within about a year it had already destroyed itself. The floors are already dirty, the lot is ALWAYS  a mess, the people inside are rude and HATE their life apparently. Ask them a question and they might just cut themself with their box cutter. This location NEVER  has enough lanes open and the self-checkout employess are never to be found. To top off everything else, the prices are actually really high. It makes me sad that people just let walmart lie to them about having the lowest prices, because they most certanly do NOT. I've price compared a few different places and the Target across the 215 actually had the lowest average prices on food and HBA. It's got a full grocery on the Garden Center side so that is where I will be going for groceries for now on, I will never step foot in this lying, filthy, horrid trap again. Now if only the moron "security" guy would get the hell out of the way!

This is the best gas station/c-store I have ever seen! They have a MASSIVE drink station with a wall of lids across from it, tons of fresh and hot grill snacks, ample registers always open to speed you on your way, and usually about 20 gas pumps out front. This is how ALL other gas stations should should be set!

Listen up people! This is THE most fan friendly team in all of professional sports. Period. I'd stop my review there but you probably want to know why, or not but I'm gonna tell you anyway!  Everything about this organization from top to bottom is designed for two reasons. To win, and to make the fans happy. What more could you really ask for in a sports team? The tickets are some of the most affordable in all of baseball and the players are really friendly too. This is a great group of guys that really appreciates the fans and understands how important it is to support them back. Best part of all is if you ever have and concerns or questions well Derrick Hall, the President & CEO  of the Arizona Diamondbacks is on Twitter. Just shoot him a message and he usually responds rather quickly. What other team is that intimate with their fans?!  Above all else, it's just fun to go out and have a night a the ballpark. But that's a separate review for Chase Field the venue itself. Just go out there and support your home team. They work very hard on and off the field for the fans and this community, why not go support them, your Arizona Diamondbacks and have a hot dog while your at it!

First off I'm thrilled to be living in the Phoenix area finally and for two primary reasons. 1) the Dbacks 2) Phoenix Coyotes hockey! I use to go to Las Vegas Wranglers ECHL minor leauge hockey all the time and I dreamed of the day I could come to Phoenix and see my beloved Coyotes play whenever I please and that day has finally come. We've only lived here for two weeks and my wife and I have already caught two games. The second game we beat the Sharks in true Arizona, hard earned fashion and it was amazing. I'm even more hooked than I thought I was before. Even the game they lost was still fun and entertaining. The fans are great, they always get into the game, the arena is incredible! Best sound system I've ever experienced, and the actual play on the ice is always outstanding. This is all around a first-class entertainment option and quite possibly the best value in town. Sure the location kinda sucks for most people, but once you step foot in that building and hear your Phoenix Coyotes howl and skate onto the ice, you know it's worth it and are already asking yourself, "when can we do this again?!"

I'm from Las Vegas, riding the Valley Metro Rail for the second time now. The vehicles are very clean and sleek looking, the payment was quick and easy, the ride smooth, and the ticket fares were not outrageus for light rail. Only $1.75 for a one way trip. I wish we had something as nice in Las Vegas! Best part is that the north terminus point ends right in front of a huge, brand new SuperTarget! I will for sure be riding this anytime I'm in Phoenix.

This is a really nice SuperTarget way out on the edge of Queen Creek. This store was really neat, clean, and well-maintained, even had music playing out in the parking lot! This SuperTarget had a Pharmacy, Photo, Optical, Pizza Hut Express, Starbucks, Garden Center, and includes the full grocery section with some of the most delicious pastries and fresh prepaired deli foods hot and cold. I'll be coming back here for the deli chicken alone!

I was a little disappointed. I was never really a big of Albertsons much less this location but heard it was remodled so i went in with the wife the other day to check it out. Yes, I do like the new look better from how it was before, it is much less cluttered and just very simple, it feels much more clean and spaced out. The prices on the other hand have not changed at all since it opened. I was hoping to find a nice new market out in this area that I could call my own as the Smith's at Durango and Elkhorn is just wayyyy too busy and very cluttered inside. I'll have to skip on this one for now. I'll stick to getting groceries from Fresh & Easy or the Target with food on North Decatur, both have very competitive prices.

Big 5 is a really great, quality sporting goods store! The have a great staff willing to help, gennerally a little pricier, but have great sales and every thing you need for anything outdoors. Good of a selection as most of the bigger stores, in a smaller, more convienent location. Not mant other choices at the moment out here in Centennial Hills, but even if there was, I'd still frequent here.

I'm not real fond of animal hospitals or how they're suppose to be, but this one is incredible. I only bring our puppy in sometimes when my wife can't, and it's never a hassle. They always make everything quick and painless, very affordable, and we're always out really fast. This is what the standard should be set on!

Nice, easy place to come get a haircut. They tell me this is their busiest location, which makes sence because there are always at least six stylists on hand. That's what I love about it here, there is almost NEVER a wait because they are staffed so well. This is the only place I go for my hair, in and out nice and fast.

I love this place and have been pretty loyal and consistant about coming here for oil changes and car washes, but lately they have been soooooooooo slow. The are usually pretty nice, but the Express Lube especially is ANYTHING other than express! It really should not take 90 minutes to get a oil change and car wash on a Thursday afternoon! The inside C-Store has lots of food and drinks options, but the one drink that I LOVE which is VAULT soda, they don't even carry. They use to, but removed it. I've asked for it back repeatedly, but I never see it. They have 500 different kind of drinks and I can't get a super basic Citris soda from Coca-Cola?! I lke the concept of Fabulous Freddies, but with as slow as it has been getting and the prices going higher everytime I come back, may just be enough to push me off to try something new.

Since my last review I decided to up the rating here, they have really been improving in terms of speed, quality and selection. A representative from here contacted me recently and seems to really care about their buisness and customers, and that is always much appreciated. The lube center is much faster and efficient than they have been in the past, and the washes have been quicker too! This is always a great and trusted place to bring your car for a wash or basic services. Even the cashiers in the store are friendly and quick. They even have a service now where you can get an oil change and wash while you're at work if you use the Centennial Hills Park & Ride across the street, which is super cool! Great for people that ride the Centennial Express to work or carpool to Nellis AFB. Keep it up Fabulous Freddy's!

The Las Vegas Strip has always been a nightmare for transportation as has the rest of the city of Las Vegas. The ACE Bus Rapid Transit system is a welcome addition to Las Vegas. The Las Vegas Monorail would be preffered in my opinion as it is a seperated grade from street level, but the Gold Line will do for now. It is similar to light rail in the sence it has it's own lanes downtown with pre-paid fares and level platform bording. The route gets a little busy at times, but other than that, it is a reletivly fast, clean, and efficent transit option.

This is the best Arby's around! The wait is a little long sometimes, but the always get your order right and your food is always fresh. They often send coupons out in the mail and in the Centennial View, also they usually have other rotating deals in house. Nothing really to complain about there, they make sure the food on your tray if in your bag really is Good Mood Food! ;-)

SmashBurger is um, well, awesome. They don't skimp here serving only the biggest, most mouth-watering burgers around.   I like to go in and get the Sin City Burger. It's a nice, big 1/2 pound cheeseburger with a hot, sizzling egg mmmm. Drop in a side of Smash Fries (thin french fries drenched in olive oil) and the best chocolate shake you'll find in a suburb, and you're good to go. Maybe a Dr Pepper to wash it all down with too!    SmashBurger also serves up hot dogs and a few other options if there is something wrong with you and for some reason you don't want a huge wad of man meat in your mouth!    And please don't go here and try to compare this to In n Out across the street, they are two very different burgers, very different places. They each have their own incredible qualities. I take one star off for the little-too-steep price and hours, only open till 10pm.

I'm really glad this Lowes has opened way out here in Centennial Hills so we finally have an option other than the Home Depot in Centennial Center, (I'm not a fan of them). The service here is pretty good, better than what you would expect from a box store like this. I've always received help when I needed it and the employees have almost always been friendly. There has never been a wait at the checkout lanes up front or in the Garden Center, and they have self-checkout too in case you just have a few small things and want to get out quick. Best thing about this location for the time being is how slow it is, because of how new it is there just aren't ever many people here, but it is well staffed and ready for you to roam freely! Keep it up Lowes!   As for the reviews below me by Chris W, I'v never encountered any of these problems at any point, and neither has anyone I know personally, having wrote THREE reviews as of 3/17/11 Chris apparently has a serious obsession with this Lowes for some reason, but don't let his poor review(s) keep you from going to a helpful place if needed. The employees here will help you.

Very friendly Pharmacy staff willing to help with whatever they can. Get's a little busy at times but the Starbucks and Pizza Hut Express is right next to the Pharmacy counter, so it's kinda nice to sit down and relax while you wait a few minutes if you must. The staff has always solved our problem and been kind and respectful of our time. This is the best Pharmacy I have ever been to. Inside a beautiful new Target store with fresh food and other groceries too.

This Jack in the Box opened only a few days before I wrote this review, I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of this location because the closest Jack in the Box in Centennial Hills had been Craig & Tenaya off the 95 until now. I went and chcked it out as soon as it opened. We all know what food Jack Box offers us, so I won't waste anytime on that. The food I did get was pretty fresh and tasty like it should be, but took a little long to come out to the table. I will give them the benefit of doubt for now, because it was quite busy inside and in the drive thru as it had just opened days ago. This location is unique as the inside dinning layout is completly different from what we are all use to with Jack in the Box, all of the old locations being the same pretty much. This one really hits the mark. Stylish, clean, has a really good feel inside. Extra kudos to this location for having the touch screen order kiosk right at opening, and the fountain drink selection is bigger too. I will be going back often, I'm so excited!

Oh how I love Der Wienerschnitzel! I grew up as a kid coming by here on and off with my dad. He would always get Chili Cheese Fries and a ton of Chili Cheese Dogs and we'd just go to town. It's still just as good as I remember from my childhood, the bread is always hot and fresh, the chili perfect, and the deals not half bad either. This is the closest location to where I live which is at least six miles aways because they just don't build many of these, but I try to swing by whenever I can. It's not the best food you'll ever have, and it's not exactly healthy either, but it's really good, fun, tasty food!

This review is for the Starbucks INSIDE Target at Decatur & 215, most people think this is the Starbucks on the other side of the freeway but is not.       Pretty decent service, huge plus that it's inside of a Target, super convienent for me for sure. Some times when it's slower in the store there wont be an employee around so you have to wait a little, but the store continues to get busier so that is becoming less of a problem. Everything else is awesome, I love to people watch from the seating area that looks out the window in the parking lot and can see the people walking in and out the front doors. Also, if you have the Target REDcard, your 5% discount applies to Starbucks too! I was so freakin' excited when I realized that!

I like Dunkin Donuts and I'm glad they started opening locations out here a few years ago, but this particular one isn't so great. If you come by in the early morning you probably won't have many problems, but anytime I come by later pretty much after 11am they are always out of things and are very slow because it looks like there is one person in the pm. Basically avoid if your stopping by after the morning rush.

I enjoy going to Einstien's for their fresh bagels and sandwiches, and I'm even happier since this location was built out here in Centennial Hills. The service is outstanding in speed and friendliness, and the food is always good, you can count on it. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because of the price of everything here which usually leaves me with a slight sour in my mouth at the end. I would suggest to anyone to go here at least once though!

New Transit Hub downtown to replace the old DTC near the old city hall. everything downtown is moving lol. This is a huge upgrade from the old facility. Nice open are for the busses, plenty of waiting passenger space inside the building as well as outside in an open area with plenty of seating. Customer Service is available as well as restrooms, Coke vending machines, and a large bike repair area with plenty of lock stations. Overall it is a very nice facility that reflects the downtown revitialization well and will be a nice asset to the transit sysyem as it continues to grow in Las Vegas.

I use to have to stock this location when I was a merch for Coke, so was in and out all the time and saw all of everything that went on in the store. The produce is treated poorly and left on the backroom floor, employees are rude and NOT helpful, and to top it off the store is wayyyy too busy and always overcrowded with FAR to few checklanes open. I would stear clear of this store.

Never did I realize when I first sat down at Steak n' Shake in Dallas, Texas in 2007 that the way I saw food would be changed forever. Since that summer afternoon I have counted the seconds that I would once again get to savor another fresh, buttery Steakburger and never would I have imagined that it would occur in our own city of Las Vegas, seeing as the closest location is somthing over 1000 miles from here. They have THE best burgers hands down, shakes that no one else can come close to, including side by side shakes that have 2 flavors. Their fries are perfect, so tiny but so delicious. The size of the meat patty isn't the biggest but it is the tastiest. It's the combination of the whole meal, burger, fries, and shake that make it just right. The combination of the perfect food along with the friendliest people in the restaurant biz make it to die for. I'm so thankful this midwest classic has chose Las Vegas as the the only west coast city to serve this amazing food in. Today is the third visit since the 16th, and you can bet I'll be back before long again. You really can't go wrong with Steak n' Shake. Next step: let's get a drive-thru location built in Vegas!   Take-Out is available and the food is very affordable. 4 meals are $4, typical check for two is about $15

I LOVE this Yougurtland location! I love Yogurtland period, but this one is AWEsome! I use to go to the one at Town Square when it was the only one around being the first location in Nevada, but that one got popular and too excessively busy. This one out here in Centennial Gateway is perfect though. Right next to Fresh & Easy, and all our awesome food places, I love that on a warm summer nigth you can easily walk across the street to cool of with one of their many different ever-changing flavors and sit on one of the streetside benches and just enjoy the night after a long day and big meal. The location helps push this Yougurtland to 5 stars, though the staff is super incredible too, always friendly and willing to help. More toppings then any other fro-yo place around this side of the desert, and like I said before, they always have new, awesome flavors coming in. On top of all that, the price is always really afforable, usually under $8 for two. So glad the Centennial Hills Yougurtland opened, couldn't have been in a better location or at a better time. Yougurtland, You Rule lol, seriously! Go check it out, NOW! As if it could get any better, they're open til midnight weekends, 11pm weekdays. Awesome again. Oh Yeah. How I love thee Yougurtland, and you make my wife happy too ;-)

Very helpful location, employees are friendly, phones are great, service is better. i have never encountered a problem here or at any other T-Mobile location. I  am a little upset to hear AT&T may buy T-Mobile because AT&T sucks, but other than that I would recommend this location to anyone. I've always had a flat fee for my service and the people here have always been direct and got me what I need. Good service is the most imporant thing to me when is comes to phone service, and T-Mobile is one of the best.

I first saw Five Guys in Denver, Colorado back in early 2010, before then I had never even heard of it. Finally had it for the first time with my wife in St. George, UT in November of the same year. The atmosphere was really cool and the food was incredible, well this location in Las Vegas in no different, they are very consistant. Now I really hate when people try to compare Five Guys, Smashburger, Steak n' Shake, and In N' Out. They are all COMPLETLY different burger joints and should be judged on their own, independently. Five Guys burger is AMAZING. It is thick, juicy, the cheese flavor stands out, and the bacon is really thick and crispy, yum! The burger is so good, I end up taking a three, four quantity bite lol, I can't take just one! And the fries, oh the fries! They are practically endless as once you finish the cup, there is a crap-load more waiting for you inside the bag, so they basically fill your size fry cup, then pour double that inside the bag on top of everything, YES PLEASE! HAHA! I only minus one star for the prices, which to me is their one big downfall, along with not being open late (past 10pm). For one bacon double cheesebuger, fries and a soda, the total was almost $14. That's quite a bit of money if you're just out for a quick lunch or on a budget. Aside from that, this one good mother effing burger!   P.S.-For those of you are not familure with Five Guys Burgers and Fries, a "Little" is a single patty, and everything without the word "little" is automatically a double. Now you know ;-)

The Westcliff Airport Express is a new commuter express line the RTC launched December 2010. This is the first express bus service in and out of the airport in Las Vegas, you can catch the bus at Ground Level Zero. From McCarran, the bus goes directly to The Strip at Tropicana, hops on the freeway and then goes straight to Downtown Las Vegas/Fremont Street. If you are a local like me then this is really nice because from downtown you can ride directly to Summerlin with no stops in-between or switch to the Centennial Express and head up to the NW edge of town off Durango and US-95. In my opinion, this service is FAR easier to deal with than all the overpriced cabs and lame airport shuttles. You can catch the Westcliff Airport Express for just 2 bucks one way, $3 for a two hour pass, or $5 for an all day pass. Anytime I head to or from the airport I always leave my car at the Centennial Hills Park & Ride and take this express service down, it's easy, fast and ecomomical. For more information on this route just check Google Maps on your phone and tap theblue bus icon, call (702)228-7433, or go to rtcsnv.com

Brand new Del Taco location up in Centennial Hills just off 95 and Durango. Open 24-hours like other locations. Pretty good service and consistent food, always know what to expect from Del Taco. This location is often not quite as busy as the one in Centennial Center, nice to have an option.

Great to have another option when it comes to good fast food out here where we all know there aren't many diecent choices for food on this side of town, too many houses not enough retail. Anyway, I went during the first week they were open so this probably isn't the most accurate review seeing as I'm sure they had extra help in the begining, so I will check back and update later if neccesary. I was greeted immediately and it was very busy. The cashier was super friendly, and my food was placed in front of me on a tray before she even handed me my reciept! Like I said, first week open though. Needless to say, I was quite blown away though! Inside dinning room is very nice, great selection of Coca-Cola products inside, not much to hate! I do wish the drive-thru was open later though, it's only open til midnight Sunday-Thursday and til 2am on Friday, Saturday. I'd probably give it 5 stars if it had a 24 hour drive-thru like BK across the street, but not much to complain about aside from that. Great food!

This really is what it's all about. Frendly service, great prices, and great location. Right?  The managers of this place are a really sweet married couple running it together. They are so kind and happy to be doing what they do and excited to help you out however they can. I've never needed to rent a storage unit before but I can say that they have set the bar here for sure. They gave me a great deal, $70 off my first three months, and you even get a free lock with your storage unit purchase. On top of all that, I love this location particularly because it's out of the city. It's nice to drive away from the traffic and to this building right on the edge of town.   I highly reccoment this to anyone that needs any kind of storage or moving help at all. This couple is wonderful and their prices and service is fantastic!

Fresh food, great taste, decent price. Great made to order sandwiches, salads and soups. Love the pick two option. Really good desserts too. Every meal comes with fresh, soft bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. The only place I leave feeling "just right" after a meal. This location had an awesome charging center with free WiFi also, can't go wrong with that!

I just moved here from Las Vegas and though Phoenix basically has everything anyone could ever want, they didn't have Rasing Canes and I ate at my location back in Vegas every week for like three months before I moved preping myself to be without it. Well go figure they open a location just three miles from my new apartment the month I move to Phoenix! I feel so warm and fuzzy inside!  I love this place because the chicken is always super fresh, the fries pair perfectly with it and the big texas toast with "The Box" is just right. The caniac sause goes with everything on the plate and I usually need extra! I'm not sure why people ar bitchin so much about this place though, it's basically the In N' Out for chicken, they serve one thing and they do it well. I can never get enough of this place and I highly recomend it to anyone! They always have the best, most fun and friendly service and I just love the pellet ice, I sware it makes the drink taste so much better.   Try it for yourself  Phoenix, but try it with an open mind. Go inside, play along with the servers, enjoy the local flare hanging on the walls and read about the namesake dog Cane one and two. I love this place and I hope you can see why too!

Just experienced this place for the first time, kinda. Grew up in Las Vegas without this my whole life, they finally opened a few years back. I tried it, wasn't a fan. Fast forward 5 years and I'm living in Phoenix, looking for an alternative to Starbucks, (soooooooo tired of them), and for some reason thought I'd give this a go again. Been seeing a bunch of commercials and this is close to my place. I'm very pleased, the inside is spacious and inviting, their menu has grown, much more choices than I remember. Most importantly, they are open late! I'm not a morning person by any stretch so to be open till 9pm is a huge win for me. This is my new late afternoon stop for when I need a snack or a pick me up to push through the last few hours of the day or wind down with a treat. Great location in Tempe with a big dining room and drive thru!

Let me just start by saying that the PHX Sky Train is amazing! It's fast, clean, efficient and economical. Trains run every 3-5 minutes so you never wait to long either. The ride is smooth, plenty of room for your luggage, and the two biggest stations are air conditioned so your not drenched in sweat when you go to meet your in-laws waiting to pick you up in July!   As of right now, being so new and all, the Sky Train or 44th Street Station rather, is a hidden jem!  This station located right at the corner of 44th St & Washington is huge, three levels with lots of waiting space. While great for light rail riders as it has an air conditioned bridge to the Metro stop, it is also built to be used as local passenger pick up and drop off. Neat,  right?!  It is built with the same style curbs as terminal 4 or 3 but without the hassle of driving into the airport. This makes it much easier to get family or friends flying through Sky Harbor with less traffic and closer to freeways 202 and 143! This station even has a Cell Phone lot just like the ones at the terminals and these actually include some metered parking so you can leave the car behind up to 4 hours and ride into the airport with your friends, super cool.   The first floor has LOTS of waiting space, inside and outside covered. Second floor has bridge to Metro Light Rail with bag check for select airlines and third floor is the actual station platform for the Sky Train.    I urge anyone to skip the drive to the airport and use this whether you're riding in yourself or picking someone up. It's so futuristic and a great addition to our fine city. My buddy even said "I feel like I'm in Tron", can't complain with that! Great asset to Phoenix, you will love this service, really! Future extentions include to Terminal 3 in 2015 and to the Rental Car Center in 2024.

Very nice new baby store. One day after my wife and I finished grocery shopping at SuperTarget, we noticed a bright, colorful sign and decided to check it out. Baby Town coming summer 2013 it said! We were pretty excited to say the least, especially with our first on the way. There's not a whole lot of baby superstores around aside from Babies R Us which can be hit and miss on stuff and Buy Buy Baby which I absolutely hate! (See Review ;-) So aside from the Target baby section there's not a whole lot of options when it comes to one stop baby stuff.        So we drive over in July and it's finally open! Thank goodness they're open til 9pm because we got there late about 8:30pm and were afraid they had closed. Pretty slow inside with it being so late and only open for a few days. Overall what we walked away with was very friendly staff, every last employee approached us. Competitive prices, a little less than Babies R Us on most things though they do have plenty of high end stuff if you have the money and want a bigger selection. Good variety of merchandise in each price range to cater to everybody. Clean, easy layout of the store, similar to Buy Buy Baby but with a better merchandise flow. They really do have just about everything you could ever need, even have a play area up front for the little ones and a room in the back that was still under construction but looks like it will be for classes and play time for moms and kids to meet new friends! My only complaint was the way the main isles abruptly terminate in the back and you just kinda have to navigate back to the other main path.       Fun store, locally owned, affordable, easy location with other great stores and food. I think we'll be regulars! Go check it out before you go to the other baby stores, you'll be glad you did.

I freaking love QuikTrip! This new prototype they is even better than the old awesome locations. This new location has plenty of parking in the front and on the sides with front and side entrances as well so you're always near a door. They split the drinks up on two sides with tea snd coffee on one side and sodas and frozen drinks on the other with fresh prepared foods in the middle. Unlike the old locations, this one also has a smoothie bar where they make fresh drinks or ice cream treats for you as well as pretzels made to order and more pastries and donuts than I've seen before. And of course they have the standard QT quick checkout, never anyone waiting more than a few seconds. Seriously it's amzing to watch on of those guys to ring up three people at once. It's why I'll never go anywhere again for gas or c-store needs. Check this QT out, I gurantee you'll love it!

Rave Motion Pictures is my new favorite movie theater! Since it opened at Town Square Las Vegas, it is the only place we go for movies. I would have to agree with Michael P. about his pros and cons, but in the end, the Pros far outweight the cons for me. They have free refills on Large soda and popcorn, and they VAULT soda on tap (which is really hard to find), so that is a HUGE plus for me. DLP rocks, and all 18 theaters are all digital. They have midnihgt releases every Thursday night, and they always fill up. The large theaters have above-average seating, some with capacity of over 450, and the smaller theaters down the hall playing the films that are towards the end of a run, with an average of about 120 seats has extra wide seating with large table areas every other seat with a cup holder every other seat between them. All theaters have the extra leg room between rows that Rave is known for as well. We make the 28 mile trip from Centennial Hills just to see a movie, and after going to a normal theater and then back to Rave, it always reminds me why Rave is my favorite. Now if only they could build more on this side of the country!

The whole point about getting an apartment is loving where you live. I love where I live! The location first off, is incredible! Only one mile from a Metro light rail station, the gate is right off a Valley Metro bus line: route 3 Van Buren. The Phoenix Zoo is literally two blocks from here, and you have Tempe Town Lake and everything awesome on Mill Ave in downtown Tempe about two miles away. Even downtown Phoenix and Chase Field is only about ten minutes away, or 5 stops on the Metro rail!  The inside is rally nice, everything is spacious and very reasonably priced for what you get. Some of the units have slightly older stuff, but they seem to update that pretty quickly as people vacate and new people move in. Even the people we deal with for the property management are fantastic.   There is a large fountain/pond area that the main pool and workout room overlook and there is even a vollyball court right near the pond. And yes there is a second pool. If you're looking for a new place to live, you really might want to give this a try. Right off the 202 Loop with easy access and quiet nights as everything nearby is mostly madeup of offices. I know I'm not moving from here for a very long time!

Ahhhhhh! It's finally here in Arizona! They added one in Vegas before I moved here a few years back, it was the first one on the west coast, and now we have our own too! Most of you are familiar with SNS from the midwest, and while this is essentially the same, it's a different format. This is called Steak n Shake Signature, basically meaning it's a limited menu in a fast food style format for urban areas. Don't worry, this one still has all the staples: steakburgers, fries, shakes. It's just a little faster and more self serve, still that great Steak n Shake flavor you've come to love! This is only the fourth location in the U.S. in the Signature format, hopefully full size 24 hour locations will follow!

This is my favorite movie theater above all, even better than the Tempe Marketplace Harkins. This theater is great because it's got 20 sceens, slightly more than normal which allows it to carry really good fringe movies that you wouldn't find at most any large movie theater. Their showtimes are awesome, always a ton of showings all day for big movies without that hour gap you get at most other theaters and late showings too! They often have many showings after 11pm on week nights which seems really good to me for being way out here on the edge of Chandler. Always lots of concessions open, I've never waited over 60 seconds at this theater, that's incredible 5 star service in this day and age. The building itself is located at the south end of the mall right next to the Valley Metro transit center. I can ride 72-Rural or 81-McClintock down to a movie real quick and it's a nice, short  walk to the front door. To top everything off its right on the mall with lots of food choices. It's my go to date theater with the restaurants out front or stop by the mall food court before a casual movie trip. All 20 theaters are large and spacious, seats are very comfortable, even for a long movie. Love the butter flavor pump they have out at the lobby too!
