Disgusting. People rave about this place and I have never understood why... Last time I was there I got a side of vegetables with my dish and they weren't cooked. Really???

So good!!! I love the shredded turkey enchiladas. The green chili sauce is so freaking tasty!!! The mimosas are amazing. They raised their prices on happy hour or I would go a lot more often but the brunch is still bomb.

I purchased the 3 hour Groupon with my sister. I called ahead and asked how everything worked. The person on the phone put me on hold while she transferred me to a "massage specialist.' She came back on the phone and told me they were all busy and told me that the groupon included whatever services I wanted for 3 hours. I only received a spray tan and and a 30 minute massage. The massage chair was not working properly. The tan and "massage" lasted 35 minutes. I was not offered any other services for my 3 hour groupon. When I demanded a refund for the facial serum they sold me (for $14 on top of the $50.00 Groupon) for the facial I never received, they told me there was no physical way to do a refund after consulting their manager on the phone. I asked them if I could get a credit toward merchandise, and they said no. I clarified that I could not get a refund, cash or credit, and couldn't get merchandise with the $14 from the previous transaction. At this point, I told them that the experience, was a crock of crap. I left, and told them they could keep their facial serum. Now I am out $64 dollars, $128 between my sister and I, and have not gotten a darn thing. I will not be returning to Planet Beach and I will advise all of my friends and family to avoid this place at all costs. Thank you very much for nothing!

Such amazing Italian food!! We love the dinner for four specials! The Thursday and Friday specials are the best! Their desserts are delicious! Love the new location, loved the old location.. Can't say enough good things!

My favorite thai place. It is not closed as previously reported. Very spicy. I love the heat but my husband can't handle it. I love the red curry chicken and the pad Thai. Very very tasty. Start slow with the heat... You will love it here. I usually order a 4 but when I get it with my husband.. We order a 3

Love the patio here!! Great for a glass of wine by the fire! Love the whole atmosphere! The fig app is my absolute favorite... I'm kinda obsessed. Love the pizzas... My second favorite is the Brie and prosciutto sandwich. It's perfection with the olive tapenade.

I have tried this place multiple times. It is terrible. I have never had a good dish. The food is too salty or too bland. Terrible.

Good food... Good atmosphere.. Wish they would bring back the oysters! Wish they had a better wine selection. I go very often with a bunch of people and never have a problem.. Love their wedge salad!!

This place is awesome! Great BBQ! However, They have disappointing portions on their sides and the meat on their sliders.
