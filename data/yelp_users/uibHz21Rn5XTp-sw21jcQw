Thank you Rosatis for coming out here..  Now i dont have to drive 20 miles for good pizza.  The thin crust pepperoni classic is delicious!!  Before they came out here,  i tried to go to pizza hut and as Barkley tells it,,  Just terrrrible...  R & R is ok and we all know about dominos...  FYI,,  go on Fridays,,  they double the coupons so you can order a good sized pizza and some wings for under 10$ if you use the 5 dollar coupon.

Okay,, here's the truth,,  Chens is mediocre chinese food, no doubt.  Its a chain of chinese restuarants and before i moved out here to BFE,  there was one by my other house.  There are 2 chinese places in my hood,  Bobos and Chens,  and there both about the same.  If your in the mood for chinese and you dont want to drive very far,,  they will hook u up, but make no mistake,, its not good chinese food!  If u want good chinese food,, P.F changs or Pei Wei, but there not very close..

Don Pedros or DP's as we call it out here.  I will tell you this,, I love the location of the place since i live right down the street ,  but as far as the food goes,,  It is edible,, but mediocre compared to the other mexican joints i have been to.  I really hoped that they would have good food, being so close to the house but it just doesnt do it.  I actually will drive 10 miles past it to go to Ricos on power & Riggs.  If you want good mexican food and you dont mind driving a little ways,  go to "Xaviers Casa Reynoso" on Val Vista & Southern.  You will definitely forget about DP's..

Decided to go to this place since i drive by it 10 times a week and i must say,  WOW,,,  very good burgers..  I have found my new favorite burger joint,,  move over In & Out,, you've been benched..  They use fresh ingredients and you can tell..  I did'nt give them 5 stars because i've gotta hold out for the perfect burger although it may not exist... I just wish there was more than 1 location..
