Wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast... Not bad but really nothing special and pretty overpriced. We ordered the full sized breakfast burritos with cheddar and black forest bacon. Bacon was chewy and tasted like it came out of a microwave and probably could've made something better at home. $21 for the burritos and 2 bottled waters. Seat yourself and pick up at the counter. Friendly service and clean but boring, bland ambiance. Nothing like the location at Town and Country. Try the breakfast club across the street.

Probably the best wings I've ever had. They're crispy and slightly barbeque charred on the outside (not messy or greasy at all) but still moist and juicy on the inside and packed with tons of flavor. Great hole in the wall spot with lots of character. Type of place common in older east coast cities, very uncommon in Phoenix.

Best Italian sausage and roast beef in the valley hands down! The have a huge selection of Italian groceries too. Also the homemade cannolis are delicious!

Phenomenal HH menu from 4-10pm! Great, shaded outdoor patio with misting system. Older crowd (40's and 50's). Food was kind of roasted tex-mex style similar to Bandera.   Awesome selection of mixed cocktails such as mojitos, etc. highly recommended!

The ambiance and the food were excellent as always. Beautiful outdoor patio and beautiful weather. We had the buffalo mozzarella and Ahi Tuna Tartare as starters, which were both extremely fresh and delicious. The waiter was great and very knowledgeable. The food took longer than expected but not terrible... We had the beef tenderloin, short rib chile and cornish game hen. All excellent.   The only slightly negative experience was in the bar area before our reservation was ready. We ordered a round of drinks while we waited and the bartender/server seemed very impatient and short with us... Let's say, the opposite of engaging... Not a big deal but the ladies ordered Prosecco, which they did not have. Instead of telling us they don't serve Prosecco, they passed off a different cheap sparkling white wine hoping we wouldn't notice. Our server later confirmed that they do not serve Prosecco. Kinda shady.

This place is awesome! Great service, beautiful ambiance and the food is amazing. This is my first time going for breakfast. Got the honey whole wheat protein mixed berry pancakes. Relatively healthy and delicious. Even the drip coffee was great. Definitely check this place out!

Taco Tuesdays for lunch are where it's at! $2 tacos and they're all delicious. They give the option of choosing between like 8-10 different tacos from shrimp, carne asada and duck carnitas to beef cheek. All really tasty on the fresh corn tortillas.

I absolutely love this place. The food is authentic, extremely fresh and homemade, including the salsas and pico de gallo. And it's relatively healthy--not greasy at all. Did I mention inexpensive? I paid $7.25 for a large shrimp fajita burrito. I'll be coming here on the regular! Really great service as well :)

This place is the best! So glad I found them. Typically whenever I need a new watch battery, I just go to the Fast Fix spot in the mall. After being overcharged several times and them not honoring the 5 year battery warranty I'd purchased, I decided I'd had enough.   I found PV on Yelp and decided to check it out. I was immediately greeted by friendly staff upon entering and they offer a FREE battery your first time in. They also steam cleaned and buffed my silver watch. Not to mention, they untangled some small knots in my gold chain at no additional charge while I waited. I'll definitely be coming back and would refer anyone I know that needs jewelry repair.

Ok this place is now officially one of my favorite spots in town. Authentic, fast, clean, delicious, affordable and relatively healthy. It's the type joint you're proud to take out of towners to show off Phoenix cuisine.
