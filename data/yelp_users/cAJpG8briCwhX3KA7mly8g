Love the sandwiches!  The bread is really what makes these things.  Grab an old school coca cola next door at the coffee shop (the kind made with real sugar cane).  Soppressata sandwich and coca-cola=killer lunch combo.

Frequent customer. Love this place. Great neighborhood spot with good food, beer, and wine selection.  Customer service is great and a fun and inviting ambiance.  Try the bruchetta and the picnic salad.

I've been using Bonds Alarm for just over two years and have been very happy with their service.  They are a local company and their alarm monitoring is done at Scottsdale Air Park.  The larger national companies contract with monitoring companies that can be located in any state.  I personally like knowing that my monitoring is local.  A little over two years ago when I researched and priced alarm equipment, install, and monitoring, I found Bonds Alarm to be the right company for me.  The national guys offer better deals for installation, but with some negotiating, Bonds ended up coming to the table with the best price, best equipment, and superior service.  Jeff is my rep and he's always available for questions on his cell phone, and he's very knowledgeable and has a long history with Bonds and this industry.  All the staff is very friendly and their customer service really can't be beat.  What triggered me to write this review two years later is that my contract just recently expired and I negotiated new terms with Bonds, which again, ended up being the best deal I could negotiate.  Highly recommended.

This place is awesome.  A true representation of an old Chicago style burger joint.  The food is great and service is good.  No complaints here.  The sliders are amazing and the dog is wonderful too.  You won' be disappointed with this place!

Best Thai in Phoenix in my opinion.  I love their extensive menu and the service is great.  The Chef here cooks ALL the time, so the food is consistent and wonderful.  Try the Phat Thai is the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot of Phat Thai).  Always clean and has a fun and funky interior design.  Enjoy!

I'm struggling with the review for this place.  I had such high expectations going in that I think it may have tainted my perspective.  However, keep in mind that this place is rated the best pizza in the US, so having high expectations is not necessarily unfair.  We waited over three hours and had a great time drinking at Bar Bianco next door.  We had no issue with the wait and I think having some time to drink and chat at the cozy bar next door was a great way to kick-off our soon to be "mind blowing" pizza.  We got sat at the bar top and ordered two pizzas--the margarita and the fennel & sausage.  The pizzas were good, but not great.  The crust was soggy and it just didn't hit the taste buds the right way for us.  We sat next to a couple that had flown from Canada for one night just to go to Pizzeria Bianco.  They liked it more than us, but they said their expectations were higher, too.  Definitely worth going to and worth the wait (to at least try it once), but I don't see myself going back anytime soon to get my pizza fix.  I prefer the margarita pizza at LGO.

This is an okay neighborhood mexican food spot.  I've been here a dozen times or so, and it's just okay.  Always an upbeat vibe at this place since it's a popular neighborhood spot, but the food it the type you say "uhh, probably won't come back here for a while."  Pricing is reasonable for what you get and the service is what you'd expect.  I'll go back, but it's not a place I crave.

Great spot.  Always a good vibe, food is consistently good, and drinks are tasty and strong.  When we have out-of-town guests, this is where we go.  You can't beat the price, quality, and vibe.  One of my favorite all-around Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurants.  Try the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich , Asian Shrimp, Summer Soltice Martini, and the chips and dip.

Delux is my go to place.  Always a great burger and my favorite beer selection on tap (besides Yard House, but I'm not into chains).  Can't go wrong with either the Delux burger or the Standard burger.  The rest of the menu is good, too.  The Chinese Chicken Salad is refreshing and can serve two.  Love the milkshakes.  Every once in the while the burger comes out undercooked, or the bread hard, so that's why I'm not giving it five stars.  I guess given the frequency I eat here, I'm not going to hit a home run every time.  Hope to see here you soon!  [Update 11/30/12] Realized that my prior review is way outdated.  At one time my favorite local beer and burger spot, but now, just a distant memory.  I've given Delux soooo many chances to change my mind.  Beer is now often flat, and my burger never comes out right the first time around.  I really hope they can fix the problems and bring back the Delux I was knew and loved.

I really enjoy Ticoz.  They have an eclectic menu (something for everyone), the service is always good, the ambiance is fun, and the food is always great.  I've been here a lot and have never had a sub par experience.  The chips and salsa variety is great, too.  Also, a great place for Sunday morning brunch (more for the drink prices).  Enjoy!

Great spot.  Nice atmosphere, good food, and great service.  This is a fun place with a group or with your significant other.  The margarita pizza is the best in town in my opinion (yes, better than Pizzeria Bianco).  The wings are also great.  Not a great selection beer, but good enough I suppose.  Another neighborhood favorite.

Great spot for drinks and small eats.  I love the old converted craftsman homes--such a cool vibe.  Good beer and wine selection and good for 2-4 people.  The space is not very conducive to larger groups, unless you're willing to stand.

I really enjoy Pita Jungle.  This is another one of our go-to spots.  Food is always fresh and good.  Service is also good.  Food is reasonably priced and you can make it a longer casual dinner, or short and easy dinner--your preference.  Try the quesidilla, mediterranean salad, and the nachos.  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3

Great atmosphere, friendly service, nice space buidout, strong untraditional beer selection, fabulous flatbread. I know this is a soft opening and they're adding more wine and food to the menu, but until then, only four stars. Two thumbs up.

Great breakfast spot.  Very good coffee, food is exceptional, and service is good and friendly.  Try to steak and eggs or the wolfpack.  Always a wait and closes fairly early on the weekends.  Get there before 11 and expect  a wait.

This place rocks.  Great new york style pizza.  Always fast (they are always busy and it never takes longer than 20-30 minutes).  I'm eager to try some other things on their menu, but when I go there, I just tend to get my pizza.  Two thumbs up!

Love AZ88 and I wish I liked this place more.  Food is okay, space is nice, but is too airy, and the vibe is just not there.  And the mini martinis for $13???  I hope they can find a way to turn this place around.  I'm reviewing this place about 6-months later, so there's a chance this could have already turned around.  But based on two earlier experiences, it just didn't fit the bill.

Great little bar.  Local patrons and cool vibe.  Don't expect a party, but they mix great drinks, play chill music, have a rotating collection of artwork, and it's a cool and friendly crowd.

Good food, great/friendly service, and a nice beer selection on tap.  The nachos (add chicken) are out of this world, and if you're fortunate enough to be there when they have live music, it's a nice treat.  We really enjoy this neigborhood spot and think the owner's have done a great job with the overall concept.  Keep up the good work!

Two thumbs up. We tried many items on the menu and were very pleased with quality, presentation, and taste. Owners did a great job of retaining the mid-century modern architecture and incorporating the previous building uses into the design. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Gabe, our server, was great. Highly recommended.

I've used Kelly and his team several times over the years. Always the best service and very professional. Auto insurance companies like to use their preferred national glass companies, but you can elect to use one of your choice.  Support local business.

Had a backed up drain last night (from cooking).  Got on Craigslist at 9am, found Darrel, and he was at my house by 11am.  Super friendly, fast service, and $45 flat fee drain cleaning.  Good and honest service!

One of my favorite neighborhood spots.  Everything is great about this place.  It's location, it's design, it's staff, it's beer, and it's food.  And the fact that the owner is almost always there working behind the bar says a lot about the place considering it's already established and known.    Their menu serves something for everyone and for whatever your taste bud mood is that moment.  Did I mention they're dog friendly?  That is has a great patio?  And Ska Decadent is on tap?

As a gourment burger lover, I was excited for The Grind to open.  I made two attemps to eat there during their opening week, but at a wait time of 1-hr + I decided to wait until the buzz calmed.  I made it there the third week, and was graciously greeted by friendly and helpful hostess'.  We were sat next to the ktichen, and although the open kitchen concept is becoming more common and can add to the unique ambiance of a restuarant, I don't think it worked here.  I had a direct view of the kitchen, staff members eating and relaxing, all while we waited, and waited, and waited for our drinks.  When we received them, my draft beer was served in glass jar.  I appreciate the uniqueness, but beers are to be served in a specific glass based on type (pilsner, pint, goblet, etc).  We ordered the burgers and they were okay, but not great.  The outside was a little well done for my liking, even when ordered med-rare.  It was a slow night, and so was our service.  We waited--a lot!  Once finished, it took over 15 minutes for them to remove our dirty plates on our small table.  We even stacked them and slid them to the edge hoping they'd notice.  Instead, we were only noticing tired and unresponsive staff in the kitchen area ignoring the customers.  I think this place has a lot of potential.  Service and atmosphere is key for  success in this neighborhood.  I'd recommend some ambient music, (you can leave the sports game on if you wish).  I'm inpartial to the uniforms, but they're fine.    There are a few tweaks to be made to make this place right, and I think the location, concept, and space build-out are all good.  I will give it another shot once they make some changes based on the feedback.    Food: 3 Service: 2 Ambiance: 3

I've been going to the Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale for the past 6 years and their food and service is great.  I was very excited for the new location in our neighborhood to open.  We went during HH and it was busy, but not that busy.  We were quoted a 20-30 minute wait, and after an hour, we were still not sitting.  I discussed with the hostess and asked if they would extend HH pricing due to their error in quoting a wait time, and the manager did not handle the situation properly and was rude.  I expect more from a seasoned restaurant who I know can provide good service and food.  I'm one who is very sensitive to new restaurants and understand there are always kinks to be worked out, but customer service is one thing that can always be good and consistent.

Love the experienced staff and the beer selection is great.  This is where I buy my beer and I like the idea of supporting our local grocer, Basha's (Sportman's is owned by Basha's).  Five stars.  Keep up the good work!

So I walked across the street for a meeting today and stopped by this new pizza spot.  I was on the move, so I asked if they do slices.  They say "of course."  I wait a few minutes, get a box with a pepperoni slice in it, and wait for it....a bill for $6.30!!  Disappointed with the price of the slice, I just left $7 bucks and walked out.  Counting on this $7 slice being the world's biggest and best pizza slice I've ever seen or had, and hoping it being worth half of what I paid for it, it instead left me in a state of depression and financial irresponsibility.  It was smaller than a typical slice, soggy, undercooked dough, and just not that good.  However, the place was clean and tidy, and appeared to have a rather fair selection of bottled beer.

I'm surprised by the 3.5 overall star rating of this place. For the price, and considering its a fast burger, this place is tops! I live nearby and eat here about every couple of months to satisfy my quick burger fix. The food is always good, and the restaurant is one of the best run franchised operations in the valley. The staff is always so kind, appear to be happy, and they're all well put together. Kudos to the owner and staff of this place.

I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could.  I was excited about this new development.  Two new restaurants in my neighborhood - oh boy!  And more importantly, another option for sushi!  Unfortunately, it needs a little improvement.  The good: 1. Beer selection. 2. Outside patio is pretty cool. 3. Bar tender is friendly and attentive.   The not so good: 1. Sushi.  Nothing wrong with it, just a lot of rice and nothing special. 2. Cleanliness.  The men's restroom looked like the urinals hadn't been cleaned since they opened.  3. Service.  Witnessing the service (our bar tender was good), but for the diners, didn't appear to be so good. 4. Who does happy hour between noon and 5pm during the week?

I really wanted to like this place. Fast casual pizza is all the rage and I've been to them all. This place fell way short. Third person in line, 35 minutes later they gave us our cold bread and our pizza had been lost. At minute 45 still no pizza and I requested a refund. Everyone in the place was having issues and the mood was very sour. The owner needs to be in restaurant this new to ensure operations are smooth. Friday night, and no owner.  I hope they get their sauce together....
