Do not go here. First off, I asked them for a exterior detail. They charged me 150 dollars for an "oversize  SUV" when in fact I had a little Land Rover, and I asked them not to do the hood as it had been recently painted. They did the hood anyway, and made me wait 4 hours for a job they said they could do in 90-120 minutes.

Awful. Bar wings were inedible, the beef was inedible, the seared tuna was gray and disgusting, and the rolls were boring.  Sixty dollars later, and my daughter and I left most of the food on our plate. Server was indifferent.

Kiwi is a great provider of quality carpet and upholstery cleaning. I use them every month. With their warranty service, it only cost me a few dollars per room. They always schedule me within a day or two of my call. I highly recommend them for your cleaning needs.

Great! Went there for takeout and they lost my order. 5 min later it was perfectly prepared with a 30 percent discount for the short wait. Great edamame and the Dirty Rockstar Roll was delicious. Nice atmosphere on the misted patio for my daughter and I with our Golden Retriever. So glad to have them downtown!

Great place to hang out. Craft cocktails are amazing. Skeeball, pinball and pool gives you something to do while you are getting silly drunk. Oh yeah, old school dartboards too.
