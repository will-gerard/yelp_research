Wow...what more can I say? This is an amazing place to purchase a good pair of runners. They have staff who know what they are talking about, they are able to tell you about your running style by actually teaching you how to test drive the shoes. From what I see, and remember they are not hardcore affiliated with any one particular brand, so you don't have to worry about them trying to push the latest style on you.  If you are looking for a good running shoe, or equipment...or even information about current marathons this is the place to go. Experienced Staff, Friendly customers wide selection! One of the reasons bigger isnt always better(store size).

Amazing Food, Great Atmosphere, Music, Sports Bar all wrapped into one. Their food is on the high end, but aye what would you expect with fine dinning!?!  Everything on the menu is a must try, great place to take a date if you want to add a little bit of sophistication without going overboard.

Have been to this location on occasion, during my single escapade I have become very fond of the double cheeseburger, however at this location there seems to be an issue with the lettuce not being fresh, lines not be handled in the most efficient manner, and the staff being rude. Not sure what gives however I feel compelled to let the Northern Phoenix community know there are better places to "have it your way."

When it comes to the Panda call me...ummm...Panda? (no witty comment). I make it a goal to eat at Panda Express at every chance I can muster. I enjoy their clean fresh presentation style, and open kitchen, made to order(close to) entrees. If you are new to their food, or havnt been within the last 6 months, be sure to try their new sweet fire chicken. However(there is always a flip side) this resturante wont give you the experience that Mr. Panda is known to provide. This location is dirty, the noodles are never fresh (ate here twice), and the in-store dinning is not too appealing.   ON A SIDE NOTE WHEN EATING AT PANDA ALWAYS ORDER TO GO, YOU GET MORE THAN THE STANDARD IN HOUSE DINNING PLATE

This is a nice park with enough room for the entire family. They have baseball, football, soccer fields. Dog parks and basketball courts. Along with 3 different playgrounds. Very diverse crowd! They all the amenities for outdoor fun. the only flaw is that they do not have a good selection of bbq grills.

One of the few barbershops in phoenix where they will not mess up your hairline, I was going to a unnamed shop in phoenix and after a week of getting a haircut my hairline would look like a 5' oclock shadow, at C&C the cutz last and the environment is one where I can bring my children.

It really doesnt get any better than this, finally a shop that doesnt tear up my hairline. It's always good when I can visit during my lunch hour and still have time to eat lunch and return to work after a nice cut and shampoo

One day I walked in and noticed the cook sitting in the dinning area, while I waited to order I notice him dig in his nose, then walk back to the kitchen and didnt wash his hands, I wasnt sure so I walked around to the kitchen to peek in and I was right...I then told the owner and his wife and they made him wash his hands. I walked out....will not be back.

This was a very good experience, excellent ice breaker and first date experience if you are tyring to get to know a person better. These events will give you much to talk about. Highly recommend for a double date or team building event.
