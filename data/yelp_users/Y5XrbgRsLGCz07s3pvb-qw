First time in yesterday.  I have been looking for a full-service barber her in the Phoenix Valley, as my regular barber (in Tucson) is on vacation till after the new year. I believe haircuts shouldn't feel like I am in the Army.  These guys are one of the few, truly neck-up barbers who fully use their barber license.  Facials ($25), shaves ($23?), beard trims($8), shampoo, etc.  Haircut was $19.  Paul was my barber and did an excellent job.  I was a walk-in and was seen immediately.  Paul took his time, rechecking length, shaved the back of the neck with a straight razor, hot towel, and massage. Bright and Clean with TVs at each chair.  Price seemed fair to the work performed.  I'll repeat.

This is not a review of the comedians or stage acts, rather the actual service of the business. I bought tickets online, through the website. It's not hard, but it's not exactly straight forward as one would expect, as it redirects you to "laughstub.com" After purchasing my tickets, I didn't receive a confirmation through my email. Rather I had to figure my way back to the website from my computer (I purchased the tix through the mobile website) and set up an account. Again, not that big of a deal, but extra work since I didn't get the tix through my email.  After printing the tickets I noticed on the tickets that we can get a pager to go next door to Copper Blues. Show time was 10pm, arrived at the Improv at 830pm. They were out of pagers and we were instructed to wait in the queue (the high temp for the day was about 105). There was a single couple in the queue. We opted for the AC and to get a bit of food at the better pricing inside Copper Blues.  I guess what killed me was the fact that the Improv advertised a "eat and buzz" waiting in line, but clearly they don't have nearly enough pagers to give out on big-headliner nights. Given that they clearly have a close working relationship with Copper Blues (same as the Downtown CityScape location) I would expect a better commitment to provide the 'eat-and-buzz' advertisement on their tickets. I know Tilted Kilt has a text message-based system.  Once inside, we were seated toward the back corner. No problem since we ate first at Copper Blues, but didn't want to wait outside in the line with the heat. Our server was slow and continually stated that he had to enter other orders before taking ours. Our table mates, another couple, received their food, with their drinks coming almost 10 minutes after the food. For ourselves, we ordered a bottle of wine.... Nothing to pour, just grab and go from the bar... Yet this still took LONGER than the mixed drinks our table mates ordered. Perhaps we just drew the short stick with servers (I waited tables in my younger years, so I recognize the type).  In summary, (1) the lack of 'dine-and-buzz' pagers, (2) the lack of a contingency plan in these situations, beyond waiting in a line with the heat, (3) and the poor basic service left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. As a result, I deducted 1 star for each of these issues. 2/5. If management reads these reviews, I hope they take proactive action to put together a decent backup plan so folks take advantage of the eat-and-buzz idea, because it is a great idea and works for both businesses. Keep the customer happy from the start and the customer will spend more at each business.  At least on the plus side, Wayne Brady did go past the typical 90 minute show, and the warm up comedian act was only about 15 minutes. It was a great show. I hope he comes back again soon.

Long grain white rice?  Really?!  Why even bother then providing chopsticks?  The food was average, if you don't take into consideration the rice... the non-sticky, slightly undercooked, flavorless rice.  I had the Thai Dynamite with chicken.  It was okay, but again, the  rice takes everything away from the dish.  I should have opted for Panda Express across the street.  Lesson learned.
