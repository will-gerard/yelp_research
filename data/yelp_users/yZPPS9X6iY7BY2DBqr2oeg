This is my absolute favorite brewery. Customers sit in the same building as the brewing vats and the atmosphere is just buzzing with conversations.  I have a little tradition here. I start with the Hefeweizen, then move on to the Kiltlifter, then finish off with the Oatmeal Stout. Then maybe another stout, then another, okay, just one more.  The food is also top notch. Everything from the nachos to the beer battered fries to the beer bread is good. I've tried them all. They also have a different list of dinner specials every night.  If you're into beer this is a place you can't miss.

Very tasty chicken and waffles. Make sure to go when they are busy so you get hot and freshly fried chicken.  Their portions are huge! The first time I went I ordered the KK's, and it was way more than I could handle. The second time around I got the Lo-Lo's and still was barely able to finish it.  All the drinks are served in mason jars.  The staff were all very courteous and friendly, I felt very welcomed.

Although not authentic, George & Son's has pretty good Chinese food.  We went there for the lunch buffet today and the food quality was a notch above the typical Chinese buffet. There were about a dozen dishes, ranging from egg drop soup to sesame chicken to fried fish to Mongolian beef. They seem to know what buffet eaters want as there wasn't much veggies in the dishes.  Service was polite and prompt and empty dishes were cleared away quickly.  They did raise the price of the lunch buffet from what the previous reviewers mentioned, but it's still a good value.

I'm not a big shopper, but whenever I'm in Las Vegas with friend looking to shop I come here. Parking can be quite a hassle on the weekends so listen to some good music and be patient. There are plenty of stores from Reebok to Coach for all types of shoppers, even a Ed Hardy store...

Extremely slow service on a Saturday afternoon. There was 10 people here yet it took them 40 minutes to prepare one chicken tikka masala pasty. The curry was hot but the potatoes and chicken were cold. I'm not sure how they managed this. If you have a craving for pasties, go to the Mesa location and save yourself some grief.

This is a great place to grab lunch if you're in the neighborhood and want some Chinese food. Lunch specials range from $5 to $8. They include soup or salad, and the main entree with an egg roll. Food is quite acceptable compared to other Chinese take out places. The quantity is plentiful and I usually end up with a takeout box for later. Service is fast and friendly. I usually go there once a week, definitely very good value for the money.  Tip: Hot tea is free

Great place to come on Tuesday nights! They have a $2 domestic and $2.50 craft beer special. Also karaoke on Tuesday's. The staff is friendly and attractive. Pool is pretty expensive at $9/hr but you can play shuffleboard for free or ping pong for $2.

Unprofessional pharmacist. A few ladies in line were chummy with one of the pharmacists and had a nice long conversation. They turned in their form at least 10 minutes after I did and yet still got their flu vaccination before me. I was waiting for 25 minutes and still haven't gotten my shot.  If you don't mind waiting about 45 minutes for a simple flu shot, this place will do.

I stopped by on a day where they were having a test drive event along with free food like burgers and hot dogs.  What a complete waste of time. They completely ignored me when I walked in. For the 15 minutes I was walking around and looking at the scooters, they didn't even bother to ask if I had any questions or if I wanted a test drive. They were more interested in talking to each other and their friends that were just there hanging out.   I thought the idea of running a business is to make money. Perhaps I am sorely mistaken because it seems like they didn't want any customers bothering them during their conversations.  When I decide to purchase a scooter, I will go look elsewhere even if I have to drive across town. I suggest you do the same and take heed of all the rest of the bad reviews for this "business."

Great little whole in the wall restaurant on the west side of town which I don't frequent often.  We had a group of friends gather here to try out their Caribbean cuisine. Due to traffic and a few snafus we didn't arrive until past closing time. They were kind enough to keep their kitchen open for our group of 10.  I ordered the sample platter and the jerk chicken. Little did I know the sample platter also had jerk chicken on it, along with buffalo wings, fries, and doughnut holes. The jerk chicken plate came with rice.  I would skip the sample platter for next time, but the jerk chicken was pretty good.  I'm looking forward to trying the other dishes next time.

Stopped by on Thursday night hoping to do some wine tasting. There were a good number of people already there so I waited patiently at the bar. None of the employees acknowledged me after 10 minutes of waiting. I tried to make eye contact and signal someone but no one paid attention. I left feeling frustrated.  It wasn't a good experience and I hope they improve in the future if they wish to stay in business.
