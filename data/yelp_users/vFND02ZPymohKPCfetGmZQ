Everytime I go to Dr Meger's office I feel like I am among my friends. It's hard to tell someone your insecure and then what you need help with. This is a group of people that are 100% professional all while being your best friend! I highly recommend that you set up a consult and you will be impressed like I was.

In a ghetto part of town but I'll be honest, probably the nicest people I've ever encountered at a Walmart.

The worst customer service. I can't believe that this store is still in operation. I will never shop there again.  Managers are of little use and no one knows what they are talking about.

The hotel is not what I expected. I called twice to make sure it was was going to be perfect for my boyfriend's birthday. He arrived before me and they wouldn't let him check in. I had to talk the girl into letting him get the room. The carpet was destroyed. The room had patches with mismatched paint. The morning we got breakfast they had a salt shaker with no salt. When I asked for more they said "sorry we are out". Everything was kind of a hot mess.

So this store made our sandwiches wrong, the delivery guy argued with us and then took our sandwiches back; delivering the right ones 40 minutes later. While we ate our chips, pickles and drank our half spilt Dr Pepper.  It's always an argument with them, so we filed a complaint and spoke to a nice guy at corporate who offered to make it up to us and buy our meals. Really nice right? We place our order, exactly the same as the one we ordered before and always order. AGAIN it's an argument, just the sandwiches were to be free but the whole meal was messed up with the Dr Pepper half in the bag and eating a pickle and chips as the dinner. I don't have time to argue with people over something SO STUPID! This place is absolutely horrible! I will order pizza for my employees and never again eat here! I highly recommend you skip Jimmy Johns!
