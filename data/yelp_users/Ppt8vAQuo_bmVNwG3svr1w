I have family visiting from out of town. He collects Hard Rock pins, and wanted to purchase one. We got there right as they opened, and they were setting up for a private party, which they told us would last for about three and a half hours. I would understand if the private party had started already - clearly somebody paid a lot of money to rent out the entire restaurant, so good on them. But since it hadn't started and all we wanted was to pop in and buy some merchandise, that seemed like something that could reasonably be accommodated. Instead, we basically got a condescending "Yeah, no" from the very disinterested employee who clearly didn't care at all. I certainly hope he turns on his positive attitude for the private party.

I haven't actually been here. But I drove by here just now and it reminded me that my friend swears by their milk and milk related products, sometimes driving upwards of ten - even fifteen - minutes in order to satiate his bovine related liquid needs. They also provide the milk for a local ice cream parlor that I enjoy, so I gave them the fifth star for this reason.

It's 6:50pm on Saturday November 28th. This is the single worst service I've ever had. We've had to ask for everything multiple times, from water to salsa. Our waiter came to our table three times total: to get drinks, to get food order, and to clear plates. One of the things that got missed since he didn't check on us once our food came out, was that one of our plates was chicken instead of the beef that had been ordered. Verbatim conversation:  Us: "So we sat around waiting for awhile, and my food was wrong, but I couldn't flag anybody down. So I eventually just ate it. Waiter: "Do you want me to take it off your bill?" Us: "That would be nice." Waiter: "Well you took a bite so I'll get you some sort of discount, but I can't just zero it out."  So why'd you bring it up?  Disinterested, slow, unhelpful. We can just order this food to go, you know.  Edit: I wrote this review while waiting for the check to come, that's how long it took. In the meantime we complained to a manager and they took the incorrect food off the bill. They apologized for the waiter not checking on how our food was, and he was honest enough to tell his manager that he hadn't. It helps, but that should have been done without hassle. And, ideally, they come over after the food comes out and catch their mistake.

It's 5:48 on Sunday, December 27th. Just got done eating a plate of pork with the sweet and spicy mixed barbecue, Parmesan fries and 7 cheese baked mac and cheese, with sweet tea to drink. The fries were great, and were the "worst" thing on my plate - by a wide margin. My fiancé got the glazed cornbread, which was spectacular. We were greeted and welcomed in, asked if it was our first time, and then given a walk through of the menu. The lady taking our order was really sweet. The guy who brought out the food was pleasant, and had a good conversation with us. Our enjoyment was confirmed multiple times. The best part was, the owner must have heard us talking about their special, smoked chicken noodle soup, because shortly after talking about it he brought a sample out for us. It was (like everything we ate) delicious... But the service was somehow better than the food.

My fiancé and I just tried this place after looking for a new place to try on Yelp. We got there right as they opened, so it was a little disorganized (no ice in the soda machine yet), but it really wasn't a big deal. The first thing I noticed was paper towel rolls on the table - immediately making me trust this place as a BBQ restaurant. I enjoyed the BBQ salsa with chips, the home style cornbread was fantastic. We tried a couple side, even ones we knew weren't really things we typically enjoyed (baked beans and macaroni salad)... The beans were ok, and we just aren't fans of cold pasta. I think they'd probably be fantastic to people who enjoy those sides, and knowing that I don't typically like baked beans and she doesn't like cold pasta, I'm not going to hold that against them. The sandwiches? Wow. I got the Chicago Fire and she got the Baltimore classic. Mine had pico and chipotle BBQ sauce, and hers had potato salad. First of all, there was so much meat, it went from a sandwich to a sandwich and half a plate. It was messy, just like it's supposed to be. Taste wise it was out of this world. We tried a sample of their sauces, and I particularly enjoyed the chipotle. We will definitely be back.
