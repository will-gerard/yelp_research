Best I've found so far...if you're looking for New York style. Which is the only type I will eat. Absolutely can't handle a bite of the gut bomb carb loaded stuff that's with Chicago style & deep dishes, etc. Its not that cheffy/artisan type. Its the fast pace, family owned pizza joint.  Note: for some reason it tastes better in house. It loses something in box on a drive. The crispness of crust...? Its small inside. If group, its tight but happy

If you can't be on the coast of Italy. ..or until you get there,  you can at least hang here. Love this place. And peach farm across street mixes well.  Good food, good atmosphere and good time.  (Try that honeyed mascarpone! YummO! On bruscetta, just sayin).
