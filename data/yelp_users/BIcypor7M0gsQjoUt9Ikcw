Menu is limited on sushi rolls. Not very many options for raw rolls. Most of them have tempura or crab mix so if you are trying to eat "healthy" I probably wouldn't come here. The fish itself (sashimi) is great! Also try the sun devil wrapped in cucumber. It's pretty fantastic!

Worst ever! Burned my nail beds. Nails are crooked and way too short. Have had pink and white for 5 years and NEVER had such a bad experience. DO NOT GO HERE!

Traveling for work, I love protein shops. This place has a really good Skinny Bitch shake that's vanilla protein, strawberry and pineapple or banana. I don't remember which it was but it was really good and really filling. I di try a protein bowl but my shake filled me up, I couldn't really eat it. I did double veg vs. rice for same price. Awesome. I wish we had one of these in MN!!

I had a great experience! I've never had eyelash extensions before and really didn't know how to take care of them and so forth, they did a great job at explaining care, fills, realistic expectations and they are incredibly friendly. I highly recommend coming here!
