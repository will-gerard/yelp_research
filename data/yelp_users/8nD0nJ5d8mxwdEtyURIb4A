I had never heard of Sophie's Bistro before I went last night, but can now say that I am a big fan.  It was very quiet when we arrived, but I suppose 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night is late for many Valley diners. The owner greeted us right away and was very friendly, and happy to find out that my date was French. I liked how simply decorated and cozy the restaurant was, and felt more like I was dining in someone's home in Paris rather than at a restaurant in the middle of the desert, with French pop tunes wafting in the background.   I ordered the Magret de Canard, and it was absolutely delicious. The duck was cooked perfectly, and the skin had a lovely crisp texture. It came with a rick leek fondue and savory potato boulangere that paired nicely with the duck. My date had the filet mignon dressed with brandied green peppercorn cream, which was melt-in-your-mouth tender. We chose the 2007 Jaboulet red wine that was light, and went well with our meals. We ended with a cocoa-dusted creme brulee that was huge, and quite tasty but a little on the sweet side.   Overall, I thought the place was lovely and will definitely go back, perhaps in the fall to enjoy the patio.

Since moving here two years ago, I always passed this place by and never thought to stop in. Then I saw in the latest issue of Phoenix Magazine that the cafe serves French macarons. I was sold. I stopped in on my way to work and in dire need of a caffeine fix, the extremely helpful lady behind the counter suggested I try a caramel iced coffee, made with house caramel, vanilla bean and cinammon. How could that not be a winning combination? While waiting, my eyes immediately gravitated to the giant, lovely macarons in the glass case. I asked her which flavor she recommended and she told me the caramel macarons are the bestseller, but I might want to try something else since I was already getting a caramel fix. She said the pink grapefruit ones are to die for, so I got one of those and a chocolate macaron. As I walked out, I took one sip of my coffee and my knees nearly buckled. It was rich, decadent and just the right amount of sweetness, not sugar-infused like a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato. And the macarons? Like taking a bite of heaven. The grapefruit was a surprise, fruity but not tart. The chocolate was airy and melted in your mouth. I enjoyed a moment in the car, daydreaming I was sitting at a bustling cafe on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. I think I'll have to make that a regular occurrence from now on.

I found it funny that my friend who comes here frequently still can't pronounce "pasty" (or "hipster hot pockets," as my friends and I like to call them), but after tasting one of these, you could call it anything and it would still be delicious.  I don't know why it took so long for me to return to Cornish Pasty Co., especially since I live so close to it, but after chowing down a delectable, flaky shepard's pie pasty and washing it all down with a frosty pint of Hoegaarden, I know my trips will be much more frequent.  Sure, it's friggin' small and hot in there, but after you start eating, you pretty much forget about the temperature and you're floating in pasty heaven. And if you're looking to get into some shenanigans, which we were last Friday night, Irish car bombs are 3 bucks all day, everyday. Not too shabby.

After hearing rave reviews for The Parlor, it certainly had a lot to live up to. And my first visit last week, it definitely won't be my last.   My dinner buddy and I headed to the Parlor after work on a Thursday to find the place packed. Good sign. We made a beeline straight to the bar and admired the warm recycled wood accents and sleek contemporary look. I had the basil gimlet and she sipped on garden mojito, and they were both refreshing and delicious.  It was hard to choose from the delectable menu but decided to take advantage of the DIY sheet. We chose a meat and cheese plate with Humboldt fog (nice and clean), manchego (nutty goodness) and salami (salty and delicious).   Then we decided to pick two 8" pizzas, and they ended up being more than enough. My friend had the barbecue chicken pizza that had a tart BBQ sauce, perfectly cooked chicken and fiery mini jalapeno peppers. We created another pizza with fresh tomatoes, wild mushrooms, homemade sausage and mozzarella, topped with pecorino and oregano. I liked that you could add herbs and pick your cheeses. The whole combination was heavenly, but could have used a bit more mushrooms. I especially loved the chewy yet airy crust.   A minor complaint: My friend and I were quoted at a half hour wait and told the hostess we would be at the bar. When we checked in after 20, my friend noticed that a couple parties of two listed after us had already been seated. If I wasn't enjoying my basil gimlet so much, I would have been a bit more peeved but the hostess got us seated right away.

My friend and I were really excited to try out Nine 05, especially because it's a project by the extremely talented Matt Carter.   Like other reviewers said here, the restaurant's style felt much more complete. I enjoyed the cute Asian touches like the sesame seed dispenser and brightly colored garbage cans under the sinks (although it was hard to fit anything in them). The decor felt minimalistic yet trendy and fresh. I didn't quite understand the baskets for the water bottles, though. It looked unattractive and I kept knocking my arm into it through the night.   Everything on the menu looked delicious, so my friend and I ordered two appetizers and an entree. Unfortunately, we weren't really impressed by any of our selections. The pork belly crepes were good, but the meat was over-salted. The crispy rock shrimp lettuce wraps were a bit too sweet and the concept seemed pretty unoriginal. And the vindaloo chicken was very under seasoned, and I didn't much care for the rice fries.   For the prices, the food didn't seem quite up to par.  I might go back again and try different dishes, or just stick to drinks, but was disappointed that out of everything we ordered, nothing really stood out. Compared to The Mission and ZInc Bistro, I did not feel wowed at Nine 05.

I bought a Groupon and was looking forward to eating at Taberna for the first time with my friends last night. When I tried to make a reservation at Open Table, it said the restaurant was currently unavailable. I tried calling a few times and only got the voicemail. When I visited the website, only information for the Beverly Hills restaurant is listed. I had a feeling they were closed, but couldn't find anything about it online.   Finally I showed up around 7 pm and there was a sign on the door that said the restaurant is closed indefinitely due to the economy. I can't really accurately rate the restaurant since I've never been, but I am a bit frustrated that there isn't any information listed on the website about the closure. Perhaps it just happened, but I didn't appreciate wasting my time and being forced to drive out there. Hopefully they open up after the slow summer months, and I can actually review their food!
