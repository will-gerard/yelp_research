This was my first time going and I had Van as my nail tech. She was AMAZING! I have acrylics and have always struggled with nail salons to get them to look natural. She did an amazing job getting them to look that way. I am looking forward to my future appointments with her!

I was looking for a new hair place. This is a little out of my ways. It's closer to my work than it is my home. BUT they're open till 10! When I went the first time, Carley was my hair tech. She is AMAZING! Her attention to detail was great! She really understood what I want. I went in there with BRIGHT red roots and very faded bland brown/red hair. She went through did one application to get the color lifted and more even. Then the second time I went, she got it all one color and it hasn't faded one bit! I will be going back again in April to put in the ombre that I want next. I can't wait! She is super sweet and very fun and easy to talk to! I would recommend her 100% and again remember, it's AWESOME that they're open till 10! GO NOW!

My boyfriend is the FedEx Ground delivery person for the area that Pie Snob is in. I asked him for a list of bakeries that are in that area that I could use for birthday treats for my work. Pie Snob was one of the bakeries he said was worth a try. I ordered 7 (yes 7) pies for our office birthday treats for the month of June. I ordered (2) banana cream, peach, coconut cream, brownie, and (2) caramel apple. ALL of them were perfect! They have a rustic beauty of being homemade. Traci was amazing to deal with. I would ABSOLUETLY recommend Pie Snob. I haven't seen anyone get so excited for birthday treats. I guess they were tired of cupcakes. We will be ordering from here again! Great job Traci!

I had them come out to spray and remove weeds. Within a week, the weeds were already popping back up and they keep on coming back.   I thought I would give them another chance, so I called them out for a quote to clean up my front yard. Now, it hasn't been trimmed in a while, HOWEVER, It's no where near overgrown, it just needed to be cleaned up and reshaped. They came out and quoted $195. I've had the front yard be in worse shape than it is now and a guy only charged $120 and did a great job. Too bad I don't have his contact information so he can get the money. When I mentioned that to Chris (from AMS), he didn't really care that someone has done it for less and just said OK and hung up. Wouldn't recommend them.

Have been there a handful of times. The food has always been excellent! The portions are large. The pan fried dumplings are my favorite and the pineapple fried rice is something else!  It's all so very very good!

I order birthday treats for my office every month and we were trying to think of something different. We came up with the idea of rice krispy treats, however, it's hard to find somewhere that makes rice krispy treats. So we used The Bakery Phx in the past and their cookie flavors were amazing and asked them to take those creative flavors and add them to rice krispy treats and they made them custom for us! It was great! We got s'more, oreo, chocolate peanut butter, snickers, and butterscotch pretzel. They were amazing and super sweet for them to make them specially for us! If they haven't already planned on it, it should be something that they carry as one of their quick pick ups. Everyone loves rice krispy treats!

Just picked up some cupcakes for our office's monthly birthday celebrations and these cupcakes are AMAZING! We didn't get any special designs, just cupcakes and frosting and they were beyond perfect. She even added some edible glitter on them to make them festive. Of the 3 different flavor cakes we got, I tried the chocolate with caramel buttercream frosting. It was moist and flavorful! The chocolate wasn't too rich and the frosting wasn't overpowering. We will most certainly use Sassy Cakes by Nina again for our birthday treats! Thank you Nina!
