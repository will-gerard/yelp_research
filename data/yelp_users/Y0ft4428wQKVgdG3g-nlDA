I have been eating here since I first moved to Peoria (I was in 3rd grade... so the late 90s?) and it is STILL my favorite Chinese restaurant. Every time I get Chinese, I compare it to Big Heng and I have never found anything comparable.   Some of my favorites: Teriyaki Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Garlic Chicken, Curry Chicken, Orange Chicken. The egg drop soup is the BEST. The PuPu Platter is so good (I love the beef skewers). They have the best egg rolls. Seriously the best. Crab puffs are amazing (they actually have crab in them, what a concept) and the best pork fried rice.   I used to ditch 4th period (I went to PHS) every few weeks and go to Big Heng with my boyfriend.   I have since moved away (first to Flagstaff, then Queen Creek and now living in Goodyear) and we still make the drive at least once a month to eat here.   They do use MSG in their cooking, which is the ONLY reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5.  The food is cheap, fast and it is always delicious. Lunch (served 11-3 I believe) is probably the best value (my SO and I can eat here during lunch for about $12) but dinner is great. The specials are more expensive at dinner, and limited, but you can sub the entrees for a fee.

I love Mimi's, and I love this location. My mom and step-dad go here at least once a week (usually for breakfast) and I got with my mom at least once a month. I am a HUGE fan of the broccoli and cheddar omelet (although they no longer have it on the menu, they still make it if you ask) and I love trying all of the seasonal items they offer. In the last month I tried the cinnamon brioche french toast (excellent) and the lemon poppy seed pancakes (pretty good but not great) as well as the new chocolate mousse muffin (to DIE for). I have never had a bad meal here, but obviously I have liked some things way more than others. The coffee is yummy and the apple juice is good too.   Service is, 9 times out of 10, great. The manager serves one day a week, every week, and I love when we get sat at one of her tables. Sometimes you get the server who is slow to refill drinks and bring the bill, but that can happen anywhere.  Also, sign up for their email club. We get coupons all the time. Buy one entree get one half off, get one free, that kind of thing.

I have never eaten here before, and I will NOT do it again. I ordered veggie fajitas. It came with zucchini, onions, corn and some kind of spicy red pepper. It was utterly flavorless aside from heat from the pepper. I don't think they even added salt/pepper. These were seriously the worst fajitas I have ever had. It comes with corn or flour tortillas. I had flour and they were good. It came with tomatillo salsa which was meh. The only thing I enjoyed aside from the tortillas were the refried beans.   Talk about a waste of 12.75. I would have been better off at Chipotle.

My boss treated us to Gyro Express yesterday, and I am a fan! He got us all gyro pitas with greek salads. The greek salad was mediocre (waaaay too seasoned - oregano maybe?) but the pita was fantastic. The meat is perfectly seasoned, the pita tasty and warm and the tzatziki, while a bit watery, was great. We had some extra gyros so I am eating the second one today, and warmed up and it's just as good. I don't know if it's the best Greek around (I've only had Dino's and a place in STV to compare!) but I will definitely be going back.

The spa pedicure was great, but my manicure left a lot to be desired. My nails were shaped strangely, and painted poorly. She didn't paint all the way down to the cuticle so even though I got my nails done 2 days ago, they already look grown out. The top coat wasn't applied to the edges of my nails so they've already started chipping.   The lady doing my nails seemed nice, but I was taken aback when she said some akin to "you pay me now" before she painted my nails. I understand that it makes sense to pay when you don't have wet nails but as I'm used to paying at the end I was really unimpressed with the way she said it, as if she thought I was going to skip out without paying.   I don't know that I will go back.

Okay, I decided I wanted acrylics and gave Phoenix Nails another shot. This experience was much better than my last! I love my nails! I decided to go with the gel polish and I am glad I did.

I love Christina. I have been getting regular gel manicures with her for the last 1.5 months. She does a great job, she's efficient, she's friendly, and my manicures are lasting me upwards of 2 weeks without chipping or peeling!

I was in a few months ago and had my hair done by Kathy (who is no longer there, from what I have heard). She did a great job with my curly mop of hair. The overall atmosphere of the salon was nice. The atmosphere was more high end than your typical salon, and I would likely go back again.

I saw VWFW at the Val Vista location throughout my pregnancy with my daughter in 08/09. At first I LOVED them. They did tons of ultrasounds (one at my 6 week appointment, one at my 12 week appointment, one at 18 weeks and they also did one at 28 weeks) compared to what some of my other pregnant friends got. The office staff was usually very nice and one of the women ALWAYS remembered me (and remembered me well after I had delivered my baby) which was awesome. They never hounded me about billing which was nice. But... things changed as my pregnancy progressed. I started feeling like each appointment was more rushed. Dr Van Eken (who I saw primarily) started off super nice but as the months went on I felt her attitude with me started changing. I was having issues with preterm labor and struggling with depression and I felt like I was a bother to her. I got so mad about something one time (I don't even remember what) that I had to talk to the Office Manager and she basically acted like I was overreacting to the situation.   My delivery was fine, mostly because the doctor was only there to catch the baby. Dr Belise ended up delivering my daughter and I don't remember much about her being there, except that she was pregnant herself and that she stitched up my tears even though I had written in my birth plan that I preferred to heal naturally.    Overall, I wouldn't say that they were awful... just that the doctor I go to now is better and as such I would not go back to VWFW.

I've been here a handful of times and I've never had a cupcake I've hated. I've tried:  Death by Chocolate - very good but WAY too rich. Definitely not one you would want to eat more than one of.  Sweet Potato Pie - my absolute favorite. It doesn't taste like sweet potato to me it is a very subtle flavor.   Red Velvet - my second favorite. Fabulous. And I like the red edible glitter on top.  Bailey's Irish Cream - very good  and definitely one I would try again.   Guinness and Bacon - this was the one I was the most excited to try, and funnily enough my least favorite. It isn't bad at all, it just wasn't "great" although I did love the bacon in the actual cupcake. The chocolate covered bacon on top was interesting too.   Pumpkin Chocolate Chip - it was okay but it was tiny compared to the others.  I've also had the plain vanilla one (I can't remember what they call it) and it is fabulous but kind of boring in comparison to these other flavors.   I really want to try the coconut cream and the triple chocolate (I am hoping it is not as rich as the death by chocolate).   Price is expensive compared to the stuff you'd get at Fry's or Wal-Mart (they are 2.75 - 3.25 depending on if they are filled or not, I think) but the quality is a million times better.   They have cake pops too, and my 3 year old has had both the chocolate and the vanilla and loved both.

I have had way better. The chips are boring. The regular salsa tastes like it was out of a jar or possibly just not seasoned very well. The hot salsa tastes like spicy ketchup got mixed into some salsa. The refried beans are probably canned (just judging by the way they curdle on the plate almost immediately) and the rice is nothing to write home about. I had the green chili burro enchilada style with green sauce. I'm not sure what in that was seasoned weird (possibly the sauce, but it may have been the green chili pork) and it just did NOT taste like Mexican food. I didn't really care for it at all and left 2/3 of my burrito untouched.   My mom goes there regularly and gets a burrito filled with veggies covered in red sauce. The red sauce is much better than the green sauce. The veggies taste awesome - especially the carrots - and she really like it. My step-dad gets a spinach enchilada which he really likes.  I am not really keen on going here again. Everything but the veggies in my mom's burrito was so... bland.It did not taste like "real" Mexican food to me. Not even Amercanized Mexican food. I am sure I will go again because my mom likes it, but I will be sharing her veggie burrito and staying far away from the green chili pork.

I wasn't overly impressed. We came here a few months ago on one of our first kid-free dates in a long time. I had a turkey club type sandwich with iced tea and my boyfriend had a philly cheese-steak type sandwich. I'm sure it would be more helpful if I knew exactly what we ordered, but the meal was that lackluster. Service was incredibly slow and I didn't get a single refill on my tea until we were already done eating. We weren't ready to order the first time the server appeared (first visit) and asked him to give us a few minutes. It took probably 15 minutes before he came back to take our order, even though our menus were closed and sitting on the table. It also took quite some time to get our check. We sat on the patio and it was quite nice out there. The food was okay, I should have ordered something else. The menu is pretty limited (although that may have changed in the last few months) and the food was just "meh".  I really want to support local restaurants like this, and will likely give them another chance.

We went back last night, in the lull between happy hours  (happy hour ends at 7, reverse starts at 9) and had a much better experience than our first trip. We started with the boneless sweet chili garlic wings and they were very good. I ate so many of them that I was pretty full by the time our entrees showed up. He got the french dip, I got the green chili plate.   Let's start with the good:   The french dip was AMAZING. It was one of the best french dips I have ever had. The beef was flavorful and not fatty. The bread was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The au jus was to die for. It came with the beer battered fries, which I didn't have but he said they were very good.   The green chili plate was a bit of a disappointment. The green chili was a bit spicier than I was anticipating (I was going to get a side of sour cream but was so full from the appetizer I decided to just take the rest home) but the pork was tender and flavorful. My only beef with this dish was the rice. I wasn't even positive it was rice. It was mushy and had no texture, like it had been way overcooked. The rice was topped with black beans and tomatoes and I was able to choose flour or corn tortillas - I asked for flour and was pleasantly surprised to find that I received 4 small, tasty flour tortillas.   I really wanted to try dessert but was so full that I didn't even want to think about eating anymore.  Service was greatly improved this time, although I think our server was new as he seemed a bit nervous. He was very nice, however, and took good care of us.   We sat inside this time and I have one complaint: it is way too dark. We could barely see the menus and had to squint to read it. I think some candles at the tables would have helped. The overall ambiance was great (probably because we had just missed the rush!) and and it was a nice, relaxing and quiet dinner for the both of us.  He insists we go back again just for that amazing french dip. There were a number of things on the menu I wished to try (street taco appetizer and the pasta de parilla, particularly) so I am up for it. Plus I would really like to try dessert.
