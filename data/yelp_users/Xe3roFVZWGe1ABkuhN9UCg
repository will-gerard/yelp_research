I went here and I told the guy this is my first time I ever been in a cigar shop and I asked whats the difference between these two cigars? He responded with "if you need to ask you dont need to be here"  then it was just silent and I walked out and now I just go right down the street to cigar ware house on 10thst and camelback.

The Greek fries are good. Ripe salad was ok. Veg wrap was a oversized tortilla with bigmac sauce and a 1/4 cup of veggies. Gyro pita was dry so tried to cover up with taziki sauce but it wasn't that good and kind of thick.

Staff was friendly and fast. I tried the orange chicken, kung pao veggies and some crab puffs. Everything was pretty good overall. I think Chinese rest. are the only places that can get away with such old furniture.

This is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in central phoenix. I always get the kale ceaser salad and calamari. Any pasta I've tried has always been good. The staff has always been great.

I dont why there is only 15 reviews. I really enjoyed this place. Everyone was super nice.. I ordered 12 wing and they gave us 24..(no extra charge) pizza was just the way I like it and they gave us two free sodas. Oh and they hooked us up with two huge containers of Ranch for our leftovers. Who are these guys..lol  usually i get charged $1 for a little tiny ranch..

Im not surprised by the awful reviews..screw this place!  I did  a oil change and free brake inspection. 4 hours later I called on the status the guy said we're waiting on you tell us what to do with your breaks we called you twice..they never called i had no missed calls or vms. He told me i need to flush my fluids at 99k I said i just did it like 10k ago he insisted i do it again..lol told me my back brakes need to be done for $200 based on the service so far I said no.. he responds ok $129 i said no he responds "sir your brakes are shot they'll be out in 3 days" I took my car to a professional and my brakes are fine and its been a month since this happened.

I normally go to zoyo but I'll drive a little further for this place. I really liked the no sugar added vanilla. I was sold when I saw the stack of mini chocolate donuts. I also like the how they have the full sized candy bars.

I used these guys 3 times so far...the first time I used them it was a hot summer day in August and I remember the owner had a sprained arm wrapped up in a sling. He was out there assisting his team moving furniture with one arm.  Creative moving defiantly exceeded my expectations.

Im putting this up on behalf of my in laws. Please keep in mind they are SUPER high maintenance and compliments are rare from them.   "They were excellent and 100% reliable. CMP moved our very heavy furniture down the stairs and were careful not to scratch any of the walls on the way down. They also dismantled several large bookcases with absolute care".

My wife and came here for valentines day. I didn't like that they sat us by the bar area, on a special evening with reservations. Overall we loved the food and my wife was happy so it worked out.

After 10 years I left wf. I opened acct with a branch on the west side. I was trying resolve the issue at this location and the rep insisted I back go to other branch to fix the problem because it was their mistake. I'm a wf cust I would think any location can help. I just closed all my accts and never went back.

I recommend the mango steak salad and the chambord margarita. I'm glad they came in to the area I no longer have to drive to the Tatum location.

I really liked the breakfast sandwich and the salsa that came with it. My latte was good and everything was priced well. It wasn't that loud so I was able to get some work done as well.

Very good food. I liked the curry but I think the masala is better. I would def get a side of naan and veggie samosa. The two guys working were very friendly.
