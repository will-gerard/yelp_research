Another review of AT&T wireless....not the store.  This may be a record; they lasted less than 2 hrs for me!  After 12 years w/Verizon I decided to leave so I could get an iPhone.  GIANT mistake.  I called to activate my phone, and was told the activation dept. is CLOSED.  I called customer service, and got it connected.  But then I called Mom and she asked why I was calling from her cell phone number?  They got the numbers attached to the WRONG PHONES.  So I called customer service back, and THEY WERE CLOSED.  It was 7pm here.  I dont care what time it was on the east coast...if their customer service dept (and tech support) cant be open when i need them, then i dont need them.  I'm going back to Verizon and im never leaving again!

I have been going to Caring for Families for about 6 years.  Upon moving to AZ, I quickly went through 2 PCPs that were just awful (1 had an incredibly rude staff and the other never had any availability).  That is not the case here!  Because they have two doctors AND PAs on staff, you can always get in when you need to.  I have found their staff to be consistently friendly and I don't see how you could ask for more.

tI recently relocated to Phoenix from Silicon Valley, where there are fantastic Thai restaurants pretty much everywhere.  I decided to try Swaddee based on reviews here.  This is my opinion on what I tried:  1. Tom Ka Gai Soup:  To be fair, I am comparing this dish to what is generally considered to be the BEST Tom Ka Gai in the SF Bay Area (Dusita Thai in Sunnyvale).  I'd give this dish a 4/5.  The flavor was spot on, but light on ingredients.  Also, they didn't use those little button mushrooms, and for the $ they are charging, I think it should have the correct mushrooms! 2. Green Curry:  5/5.  Superb.  Fabulous.  They could add some eggplant though. 3. Spicy Fried Rice:  4.5/5.  The flavor was good, it was cooked properly.  If they offered it with crab, it would be mind blowing. 4. Green Papaya Salad:  3/5.  I was disappointed that the sauce wasn't quite right.  I don't know what makes the dressing so tangy, but they should use more of whatever that is! 5. Spiciness:  I order my Thai food as 'Thai Spicy'.  Seriously, restaurants will question me repeatedly because they are afraid to serve it to me the way I like it.  I ordered everything except the Green Papaya Salad as a '5', which is supposed to be their Thai spicy.  Not so.  They would have had to double it to give me what I was expecting.    That said, it was quite good and I will return.  However, I'm going to try a few other places first...............

When I adopted my cat, Luca, in CA last year, he was having some problems with blood in his litter box.  The vet I was using at the time didn't show much interest in solving his problem.  She said he probably had worms and gave him a shot.    It got a lot better over time, but a year later he was still periodically bleeding; I would find drops of blood on the white tile in my apt.  So, I looked at some Yelp reviews and found a new vet.  He diagnosed possible Colitis and put Luca on a hypoallergenic diet.  There was a significant decrease in blood so I thought we had it figured out.    We moved to Arizona and started going to Banfield.  After about 10 mos, Luca started to bleed more often.  His new Banfiled vet (Tempe on Elliot) INSISTED he see a specialist.  I was LOATHE to go.  I was afraid the specialist would order a $2,000 colonoscopy then tell me nothing useful.  Boy was I wrong!  We saw Dr. Polina Vishkautsan, an Internal Medicine Specialist at VCA Referral Center in Mesa.  It was $162 for the consultation, and worth every penny.  Much to my surprise, she gave me her undivided attention for an hour.  She listened carefully to his history, and recommended we do a fecal test specific to a parasite called Tritrichomonas foetus.  She told me that this parasite isn't widely known, and while Luca's symptoms were not typical, she thought this was likely his problem.  She took a sample and sent it to a lab at a university in North Carolina that is conducting research on this parasite ($144 for the test).  One week later we had our answer - Luca has Tritrichomonas foetus.  He is unusually lucky in that his symptoms are very minor.  Most infected cats have terrible bloody diarrhea, and many are euthanized.    I had done some research and discovered that when she told me the treatment for the parasite is 'not pretty', she was right; it could actually kill him.  We discussed his quality of life and decided not to treat him unless for some reason he gets much worse.  This information came at a critical time.  With all the foreclosures in the area, I took in 2 foster cats.  This new information made it very important to keep the fosters isolated, for their own safety.  Dr. Vishkautsan is an EXCELLENT vet.  She is one of those rare professionals that is truly dedicated to her craft.  I highly recommend VCA and Dr. V.  For $300 I got a definitive diagnosis, and I am so happy to finally know.  And I didn't have to get the $2,000 colonoscopy done!  Thank you so much Dr. V!!!!

I ordered delivery from GrubHub and really regret it.  The food showed up without the drink I ordered, which normally wouldn't be a big deal, but these guys chare $9 for delivery!!!! PLUS, he got his 15% tip!  For that kind of cash he should have gone to the corner store to get it.  His 'I'm sorry' cost me alot of $$$$.  And, to top it off, threw out the food.  They put an enchilada into styro without a foil lining, so the enchilada melted the container, rendering the food inedible.  Awful customer service.

If I could give Dish -10 I would.  They recently switched a lot of their functions overseas, and the company has fallen apart.  They can't keep track of their accounts, and the result is an unauthorized charge of $300 to my checking account.  They have literally stolen my money, and because I have service with them my bank won't consider it fraud.  I had to cancel my debit card.  One CSR at Dish says I owe them the money, and the next one I talk to says it was refunded.  They have NO idea what they are doing and will steal your money too if you let them!!!  DON'T SIGN UP WITH DISH NETWORK YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have eaten at a multitude of hole-in-the wall taquerias in CA and AZ.  I prefer them to chains as a rule.  I have NEVER had anyone tell me the tacos i ordered are the same thing as the flautas i was served.  Tacos are open faced.  Flautas are rolled.  I didnt want flautas, i wanted tacos.  Wont be back!!!

Ok this was my third try and the last.  The first two times I went for pho at lunch.  Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me I should have to wait 20 min for pho) and my pho ga was MEH (I believe that was beef broth in my ga-LAZY).    This time I got crispy rolls and BBQ pork vermicelli and the service was markedly improved.  The crispy rolls were the best I have ever had and I loved the fresh fixings that came with them.  I love spicy food but found it odd that their fish sauce is spicy.  I've eaten at lots of Vietnamese places in silicon valley and the fish sauce was always sweet.    The pork was severely overcooked.  Most pieces were the consistency of jerky; some were so hard I couldn't tear them in half with my fingers.   If this is authentic Vietnamese, I'll take the Americanized version where my fish sauce is sweet and the meats are tender and juicy, thank you very much!

I have given this restaurant FOUR tries and they have failed every time.  Today was the last time I even attempt to patronize their restaurant.  Their food is not that good, and their service is ABYSMAL.  We arrived shortly after they opened for lunch.  There was a single party of five in the restaurant.  While we waited for even a drink order to be taken, the other party was served by all three people working (couldn't spare one for us?), AND another party came in and got their order taken.  Repeatedly they walked by us, and ignored us.  We waited 10 minutes then left.  Each of my four experiences there have been like this.  I will never return.  I really hope the owners read this.  They were there today and completely ignored us.

RIPPED.ME.OFF.  I went there for a simple repair of a blind stitch to one cuff of a capri-length pant.  I waited a week, went back for my pants, and they looked great on the hanger.  I got home to discover that they had folded the pants on the hanger so the cuff with the original stitches was visible.  I opened the wrapping to find that the 'repair' of the stitching to the damgaged cuff was only two stitches at each seam!  The whole cuff was falling forward because they didn't fix it correctly!  What the FFFFF did I waste time driving to Tempe for?  It wasn't a lot of money, so I'm just never going back and will give you all the benefit of learning from my mistake....  P.S. need someone who does decent alterations/repairs in the Laveen area....

I did not like this place.  I ordered two of my standards:  Thom Ka and Papaya salad.  The papaya salad was sopping in sauce that was way too fishy instead of zesty, and they charge more for it here because they serve shrimp with it.  I was very disappointed as these dishes are no brainer thai standard faire and neither tasted right.

I cannot believe I am about to say this: AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.  For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.  I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?    OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!!  This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!

Since I moved to AZ from CA I have tried several Vietnamese places, and until now was eating only at Pho Dalat.  I recently relocated near MCC so I decided to try Pho Ao Sen, and boy am I glad I did!  Their food is fantastic; the meats being much higher quality than most local competitors.  I've tried three of the rolls from the appetizer menu, the pho ga, and two different bun dishes.  All were excellent.  The atmosphere is very nice.  The service can be a bit slow like most asian restaurants.  The only thing lacking IMHO is a liquor license; I likey my beer with my pho!

Arrived at 11:30 on a Wednesday and ordered promptly.  It took 30 minutes for a salad and a french dip (and they weren't very busy).  The fries were cold.  The sandwich was cool.  The au jus was hot enough to burn my lip, thereby rendering the whole thing inedible until it cooled.  The ranch was so runny it was like water.  And, to top it off, got a touch of food poisoning.  Won't ever go back!

After nearly six years of eating here, today was a shocking experience.  I ordered papya salad, and it tasted OFF.  Too fishy, not enough zing.  I sent it back after a few bites, declining for another plate.  Much to my surprise, THEY MADE ME PAY FOR IT.  That's the last of my dollars you will ever receive!  Didn't even TELL me.  Just dropped the check and said sorry the owner says you have to pay becuase you didn't get anything else.  What?  I was afraid to order more after receiving what appeared to be turned shrimp?  So I have to pay for your food I didn't eat?

UPDATE: Went in for a bowl of Pho, watied 30 mintues, walked out.  When I notified them how long I had been waiting they magically found my food and offered to make it to go.  They should have comped it after a 30 min wait.  I am never going back.

I just moved to the neighborhood so I decided to give it a try.  Mimi did a FANTASTIC job on my pink & whites.  I am very picky about them.  She listened and gave me exactly what I wanted.  I give her 5 stars.  Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the pedicure as much.  They only carry China Glaze polish.  While it comes in great colors, it's a crappy polish and was all chipped only 3 days after my pedi.  OPI stays on 3 weeks.    I will return to Mimi for my nails but am taking my toes elsewhere until they get better polish!

The people who own this place have a lot to learn about doing business. The ribeye steak that came with my eggs was a flank steak,  Not a ribeye. The steak was a third fat that I had to get rid of. Unfortunately this was my first experience at this diner and the owner and his buddy decided to sit at the booth next to me. Because there were no other diners in the immediate area I could not help but overhear their entire conversation. Conversation consisted of complaints about servers needing pens, the awkwardness of singing happy birthday to people when you don't know their names, it went on and on.  After 7 years in the food service industry I already knew about all of the problems.  They're normal.   And I didn't enjoy the owner's bitch session.   It ruined my meal. Who in their right mind is having these conversations in front of customers?

I will admit that I didn't read the fine print on the Groupon and tried to use it on a Saturday afternoon, but the experience was bad from start to finish.  You know that parking will be difficult in that area, so once you've managed to arrive, you're expecting to treated well.    It was pouring rain outside so we inquired about perhaps a hot buttered rum to warm up.  The bartender informed us they didn't have anything like that.  We asked about brandy, and he said they had brandy and asked what kind we wanted.  We asked what they had.  He said he didn't know and went to look.  He returned to tell us that they didn't have any.  Mind you, this is the BARTENDER, and he never even suggested a coffee with khaluha or ANYTHING.  We setteled on jack and coke and looked at the meager menu.    They say they are a bar and grill, but your choices consist of two sausages, a couple burgers, a single turkey sandwich, and i think two salads.  It was a joke.  When we were denied the use of the Groupon, we paid our bill and left.    As we were leaving there were people at the door that appeared to be the owners.  We walked out shaking our heads at the experience.  Y'all can keep your $10 I wasted on the Groupon.  We already wasted $2 for parking to get to an establishment that is more a bar that serves something to eat than a bar and grill, where the bartenders have no idea what is in stock, nor do they know how to suggest a proper alternative.  REALLY people?  You will be closed in no time.....
