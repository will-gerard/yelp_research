The "show" is basically an improvised, anything goes, Italian wedding. I've seen good improv shows and I've seen bad improv shows. This doesn't even earn "bad" status, it's just a wretched mess. I'm sure many of the actors are talented and funny, but in this context it just doesn't work for me at all.   Maybe if you've never seen a live performance before, you'll find it enjoyable, but the food is a notch above chef boyardee straight out of the can. You couldn't pay me to come back to this. Spend the money in Vegas and see a real show with real production value.  I would rather go to McDonald's and listen to white noise.

Great, cheap, and just a plain knock-out lunch spot.
