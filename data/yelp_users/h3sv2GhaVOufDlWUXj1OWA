I shop at this location almost daily! The employees are very friendly and the store is always very clean and well stocked with a good variety. I love to shop the weekly specials. It's a great bonus being able to used the Fry's fuel points too!!

There is NO WAY someone could honestly give this place a good rating unless it's a fake account created by the employees...  Honestly, a one star rating is even too much for this place. The Lead Office Manager is nice (so I guess, that one star is for her) and the young gentlemen in the front office, the rest on the employees (including maintenance) are all VERY rude and stuck up.  The Assistant Manager completely lied about the size and storage space of the two-story unit I moved into. They refused the let me see the actual floor plan of the unit, not even the day before moving in when I was signing my lease!! This was completely intentional, because if I was able to see the unit with closet sized bedrooms, ZERO storage and joke of a walk-in-closet (it's actually more like a narrow hall way with two 2 foot rods at the ends), I would have walked away. On move-in day I asked to transfer to one on the other units that they had showed me to show a comparable bedroom, living room and kitchen size (which I found out that units were not at all comparable!!) The bedrooms in the two-story unit are designed for a twin sized bed only (8ft x 7ft). I had a Queen bed and only had about 1ft. of walking space around the bed! The living room was MAYBE 10ft x 8ft. And the kitchen is so small that is only fit one person at a time. Also, the unit was disgustingly dirty upon move-in day that I had to an entire day cleaning it before I could move in.  NOISE, NOISE, NOISE! These apartments are so poorly built, you can hear your neighbors TV as if it's inside your apartment. Not to mention, how horribly disrespectful neighbors are. They drive through the parking lot BLARING music for the whole complex to hear, play call-of-duty video games with the surround sound turned all the way up (literally rattling the windows like an earth quake) from 9:00PM-3:00 AM almost every night and don't expect the office to do anything about it either. After several sleepless nights and management not doing anything, I started calling for the cops to come out and deal with it.  People constantly have sexual relations in the hot tub, one late night of walking my dog I witnessed that and another morning there was bra hanging from the pool gate handle. Yuck!  Yes, it's nice that it's dog friendly, but again with the disrespectful neighbors thing, nobody cleans up after their dogs. (My friend lives in the complex across the field, which a wonderful apartment BTW, and it actually has a dog park and very friendly residents who all meet there after work to let their dogs play together.)  Also, expect your car to be broken into (happened twice to me and once to my good neighbor). Expect to have many things stolen from you if you plan to move here.  It got so bad that I tried to break my lease, but they wanted nearly $3,000 to do so. The day my lease ended, I was so THRILLED to move out!!

Their pizza is the best I have ever had as well as their ranch! It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's the only pizza worth the price!

I was referred to this office by a friend and will always be thankful! This is the first dental office that I actually want to go back to. I've been to numerous offices around the valley and have all sorts of horror stories to tell in regards to those office visits. At Provinces Dental they are so caring and friendly. Dr. Ruth Bergloff specifically is who I've had work done by, she is very gentle and considerate of making sure I am comfortable during the whole process. I would recommend to request Kim for your cleanings, she does a excellent job! I had another hygienist do my cleaning who simply did not have the sincerity in her work like the Kim does; she gave off the "just another patient closer to me being off work" vibe, but perhaps she was just having a rough day...  I will say I have noticed some changes in the flow of the office, not sure if it's due to new staff members adjusting to becoming part of the team or what, but I could sense that the office is a little less harmonious than usual.
