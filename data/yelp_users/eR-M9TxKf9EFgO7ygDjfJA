Thanks for not even cooking my pizza to a regular cook, even when I asked for well done. Amazing, through half of it away. Oh but my garlic knots were way over cooked. What is going on here? Waste of money and food and over half of it went in the trash.

You would think you wouldn't have to ask 4 times for waters and then just go to the bar and get them yourselves. You would think they'd provide silverware, or at least napkins. They didn't. But don't worry, my girlfriend had that covered by having to go to the bathroom to bring our table back paper towels. The service was by far the worst. Extra star because we did enjoy the music and dancing.

I ordered an Asada Arizona burrito and a quesadilla. Got back to work and took a bite. Wasn't aware Arizona burritos had beans, lettuce, sour cream, no fries or potatoes, no carne asada. Extra star because the quesadilla was decent.

Went here the other night with my girl, worst filibertos I've ever been to. Chicken quesadilla and an arizona burrito took 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES!! The girl at the counter was rude and had this look on her face like she hated life and taking our order was just making it worse. The arizona burrito tasted like crap, I don't even know that it was carne asada. It tasted more like plain ground beef. The potatoes weren't fully cooked. The chicken quesadilla looked as if it was soaking in a pool of grease for the entire 20 minutes we waited. I will NEVER go back to this location, absolutely horrible. Stay away from this Filly B's.

They say people are more than likely to tell their friends about negative experiences with a company rather than positive. Southwest Airlines. I cancelled a flight almost a year ago and was told to BOOK by April 13th. I called a few months later to check the date, again told BOOK by April 13th. I go to book a trip and the funds don't work, I call and they say oh sorry you must TRAVEL by that date. So I escalate the call. The best they can do is extend it 6 months. Fine. But they want to knock $100 off my credit, for their miscommunication. Saying oh southwest still pays taxes for the flight you didn't take so its policy. You mean taxes I paid? For my flight? That I had to cancel? Taxes for a flight I didn't board? And on top of that I have to let it expire, then book call them again and get the credit issues with $100 missing. They also kept saying oh sorry we can't speak for the conversation you had with other people. Sorry, your people speak for your entire company.

Had this for the first time last night the "dank" with jalape√±os wAs delicious. Very nice staff as well. I don't remember what the lady got but she enjoyed it. Fairly priced i suppose. I would definitely go back.

They should just call this place the Kanye Club. It's all they play and it's annoying. Other than that no complaints.

This is me and the girlfriends new favorite coffee spot. Glad we found it. Not only is the coffee cheaper than Starbucks and other chains, it's so much better tasting!! Also, the rooster breakfast burrito is killer! I want one now! Can't wait to wake up and hit this place up again. Really nice staff too and a cool little place to hangout. A large latte is under $4.

I started going here when this bar first opened and it was good, but was also the only sports bar around. Thank god more opened because the service, food, and management suck now. It can be expected that it will take forever to be greeted by a server, than will take about 10-15 minutes to get your drink. And good luck getting your food in a decent amount of time if it even comes out right. Don't bother telling management because they seem to just collect a paycheck and don't care. They have their regulars and it's all they care about. I used to he one, almost daily. But I can't even handle going once a month anymore.  I keep thinking when I go back they might have changed and earn me as a regular again but it never changes. Place has become a joke. Hey Mr. Goldman hire some real managers and servers and cooks who can get orders right the first time. And tell Jimmy or whatever that unfriendly Jets fan behind the bar is stop talking to his regulars, other patrons at the bar need drinks too. The big beers are a good deal, if they don't come out flat which seems to be their new trend. Take your money to Temple bar, or any other bar. The food and service will be better, trust me.

I've been going to this gym for years, and I love it. It's small which is nice, gives it more of a personalized feel. That kid Arin at the front desk is always so nice and helpful as well. Top notch guys at night. He's been my go to guy for 5 years, they need to make this man a manager or salesman, always great with the members. Keep up the great work mountainside! You've got a few great members on your team!

I live all the way in North Scottsdale and I'll tell you right now, the drive to see Mariela is worth it. She's the only person other than my boy in San Diego that has actually cut my hair right. Best cut ever and she's quick. Inexpensive too. Haircuts at these "barbers" out here are like $30 before a tip and without a beard trim and are never right. Take the time for the drive out you won't be disappointed. Even with a beard trim tip and gas it costs me less than any scottsdale wanna be overpriced barber.

Gadzooks is amazing!!! Wish I didn't live in Scottsdale so I could eat this more often. Cool staff, better food. I always have to get 3 enchiladas because I can't decide on one meat. Short rib, pork, and chicken. All good. Then I can't decide on sauce so I go half red and green across all of them. Then I can't decide on cheese so I get both. It's all just SOOOO good. Everyone needs to eat here. Please open more locations!!! chipotle sucks!

I was recommended to Shaun by a friend of mine. I had a tear in one of my hip flexors that seemed to not be getting better. Shaun recommended I do a few things at home, see how it feels, and go from there it needed. My hip is feeling better, I've eased back into some of my workouts without issues, and can finally get in my car without any pain. Friendly and honest staff. I was hesitant at first thinking they'd do the free consultation and just want my money, but was not the case at all. Definitely recommend this place and Shaun. If I reinjur myself I'll definitely be coming back.

This location is absolutely ridiculous. I went with a friend to eat here when it first opened. Mind you it was her first time having barros and I told her how good they are, after all it's my favorite pizza. Well it was disgusting and under cooked. Strike one. Then my girlfriend and I came to dine in. After roughly 30 minutes I went up and asked where our pizza was. They couldn't find it. Turns out it went out on a delivery run and thank god I said something or we wouldn't have ever gotten a pizza. Tonight is STRIKE THREE. I called in an order for 2 large pizzas for my girlfriend to pick up on her way home from work and gave them her name as she was the one picking up. So she arrives to pick them up and they claim there's no pizzas ordered for us. Turns out someone with my same name ordered as well and came in for a pick up and they gave him our pizzas. Now she has to wait there while they remake our pizza. Way to go Barro's! You're new location needs a serious management change and some competent employees.

Here we are a couple years later. I drive to gray hawk to pick up even though I live RIGHT across the street from this location. They don't make the pizza the same as other locations, it's ridiculous. My roommate also picks up from pavilions or gray hawk. HEY BARROS. 2 YEARS THIS LOCATION STILL CANT GET THE RECIPE RIGHT!

Well, had some friends in town from California. Decided we would go out since it was 4th of July weekend. Arrived here, and we were each charged the $20 cover which we expected, plus the $10 ATM fee. Looked around...no girls on the stage. Ordered some waters and a couple beers. About 5 songs went by...still no girls on the stage. Then a girl came up asked if we wanted lap dances. We said no, I mean we haven't even seen anyone dance yet. So she said she was up next (who else is there? You're the ONLY one who could be up apparently) and she may change our minds. She never came on stage after 2 more songs. There is more bar and wait staff than dance staff. Thanks Bones, really enjoyed the $112 for 2 Coors Light bottles and 2 Voss waters.
