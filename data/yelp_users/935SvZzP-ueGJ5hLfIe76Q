I usually love Panda Express but I won't be coming back to this one! The two ladies working were really rude to both me and my husband and were slamming our food and drinks down on the counter. One lady barely  put any chicken on my plate. I asked if she could put a little more. She said "I can for $1.50!". To top it off they barely spoke English. Ive never had an experience like this at a panda express. I won't be back here that's for sure!

I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!

Im pretty upset with this place.... Staying at the Orleans I was excited that they had this place since they serve Starbucks drinks. Yesterday i ordered a triple skinny vanilla latte. When they handed me my drink i knew it wasn't right by looking at the color of it. I asked if it was a triple and the lady started arguing with me that i didn't order a triple. I also asked if it was a skinny since i don't handle sugar too well. It wasn't. My husband was with me and heard me say it. I order the same thing every time. Today, i thought i would give it one more chance since i don't know where another Starbucks is. I totally shouldn't have....  I ordered my drink again, we waited about 15 minutes and everyone else was getting their drinks but me, my husband finally went up to the counter to ask about my drink. They totally forgot to make it. Once they started making it, one of the ladies had my drink in her hand and bumped into the other lady. Half my drink spilt on the ground. We saw her not add more coffee but try to fill my cup with ice instead! We made her remake the drink and she was bitchy about it. You wont see me going back to this place!

I love this place! The owner is super sweet and has a great selection of vintage inspired clothing and accessories. Her prices are great too! Make sure you check out her store, you won't regret it!
