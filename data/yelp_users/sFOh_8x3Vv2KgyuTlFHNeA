Much like everything else in Arizona, this is very large and in charge and flat.  The decor inside is a southwestern motif of zig zags that gets pretty psychedelic.  The recent renovations to Terminal 4 have been pretty impressive, although I noticed the southwest motif is still alive and well.  The bad thing? If you ever connect in Phoenix, get ready to walk your ass off. Each "Satelite" gate is so fricken far. you are always somehow late at some point.  The great thing about it? Free Wifi. So if you ever get stranded there, at least you can chat and surf the net or what not.  It's awesome.  Randomly this airport has no terminal 1, and terminal 2 was built in like 1950.  Terminal 3 is nice, and Terminal 4 is the "desert jewel" of them all.  Anyway, another complaint I have about this place is that baggage takes 45 minutes to come out. Annoying. Probably because its so frickin far from the gates and its massive! But again, free wifi. Score!

**200th review**  Who knew in the middle of the desert you would actually find an authentic Japanese Sake House??? Hidden in a random strip mall, Ichiza serves up some tons of Japanese style tapas for everyone to enjoy.  Came here for dinner with some friends... because we didn't want the typical buffet dinner or the calories that is often associated with Vegas.  Decor was charming. It had 2 sections of large tables with the tatami style seating.  It was pretty quaint.  The lamps were really dope. They were homemade and it looked like philo dough bound with a fish grill on it. It was pretty impressive. They also had the typical hand made signs of the specials plastered all over the bar.  The service was spotty unfortunately however our waitress was really cute with a cute Japanese accent.  When asked about recommendations, there were none.... she replied that everything was good.  Don't come here being extremely hungry... the portions are smaller than the typical sake houses in LA, but hey, its supposed to be appetizers, right?  The karrage Chicken was really good- tender and not too much batter... the pork and kimchi was delicious... the chicken wings and yakatori were not very good. Perhaps adding some fresh wasabi and lemon juice would have kicked it up a notch??? Agadashi Tofu was weak in flavor.. have had better in LA.  Best dish of the night?  The sea bass which was delicious and excellent. Highly recommended. Very moist and perfectly cooked in a sweet soy sauce. I could have devoured that entire dish myself!  Order a pitcher of Kirin, some Calpis Sochu, and some sake and you got yourself a rockin Japanese style party! Recommended and will tell my friends about this place for sure in the future!

This place is really 3 stars, but because it brings me a sense of nostalgia, I will be generous and give it 4.  3 of us guys ordered 1 1/2 pounds of meat- Chicken, Beef and Pork.   I thought it would have been carnitas, however it was more of a pork chop.  Chicken was great, and the beef was just eh.  The best part about it all were the thick, delicious homemade tortillas. Delicious!!!   A tip that we have always done since high school- switch out the pico de gallo with guacamole free of charge. Use the salsa from the chips and salsa and you are all set. Squirt some lime on your fajita and bam, you have the best tasting fajita this side of the I-17.  Pretty reasonable and tasty and for sure filling, just beware you will smell like what you ate for the next 18 hours after coming here.

What happened to this place.  Ordered 2 California burritos and it was disgusting. There was no taste and the meat was debatable.  Ordered Carne Asada fries and it tasted like mush as well. Fries were soggy and everything else was lacking flavor.  Worst part? I WAS DRUNK WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS GROSS.. SO YOU KNOW IT WAS PROBABLY PRETTY BAD! AND HOW DID MY BILL END UP BEING $14 FOR 3 ITEMS?!  Nachos from Taco Bell would have been a better choice.. damn it. Don't eat here.

Random area. Must be a converted home back in the day in central Phoenix.  What I was impressed with was the table side guacamole. It was absolutely delicious. The waiter made some crazy concoction and the secret ingredient of pomegranate seeds added. Gives is texture and a sweetness to the guacamole. Absolutely genius.  The sangria was amazing as well. They serve it with a shot of Jack Daniels and it tastes like juice.  Finally the churros are soooooooo delicious. Who doesn't like fried lard sticks dipped in cinnamon and sugar filled with caramel?!!! Dude, move over Disneyland churros and Costco churros, this is your bling bling cousin!!!  My entree- some halibut, was lack luster. I didn't enjoy it as much as it was hyped up to be. Presentation of it looked like something that came out of a buffet line- messy and uninspired.  Tried a nibble of the famous 16 hour pork as well and I was underwhelmed.  In conclusion- come here for perhaps a snack? They were incredible.

This place sucked. First of all, as an out of towner- I have never seen so many old fake orange women in my life. I felt like I was in an episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County: Scottsdale Edition. I am just bitter because I came here for a joyous occasion of a wedding VIP party, but I was denied access at the door because I was wearing tennis shoes. Gimme a break, my shoes weren't some  salvation army shoes. They were quite expensive "plaid original chucks" that had character and style. They still denied me in after I complained saying I have never had a problem in LA, SF, NY, VEGAS but clearly Scottsdale I do.    Anyways, after the $10 cover charge, they gave me a ticket for a free fish taco or something. Sick. I don't want to eat fish tacos at 11pm. This place reminded me of Cheesecake Factory after dark. Everyone is old. They don't have a DJ, instead they have a band that does bad covers of bad songs like "Wind it Up" and "Glamorous".   Worst part? I saw old guys wearing phat farm tennis shoes and mandals. How the hell are mandals allowed at a club but trendy kicks aren't?  Avoid this place at all costs unless you want to get picked up by a lonely horny housewife of Scottsdale. The themesong to this place should be Nelly's MANEATER.

its $7.77 for steak shrimp and salad. What else can you ask for? Mashed potatoes taste instant, the salad dressing is goopy and the steak was overcooked... but again... its $7.77. Just eat it.

Alright, it takes a lot for me to give a joint 5 stars, but bravo Vig, you did it.  The place is classy, chic and cozy- something you would imagine in a more posh neighborhood, however its just a neighborhood lounge. Plasmas with all the games, attentive bartenders, a cool crowd, lounge-y music, great fire pits and a nice back patio (my only concern is when its 5000 degrees outside in the summer, what happens?)   Another bonus to this place??? BOTCHI BALL (spelling?). I have never seen that in my life but it was quite entertaining.  What better than get drunk and then exercise under the stars?! Genius.  Why this place is really a 5 star joint and not 4... the drinks. They are so cheap! I bought 3 rounds- beers, premium top shelf drinks and the tab was only $35!!! Phoenix is the land of milk and honey of cheap prices!  DO come to The Vig. It is awesome!  BTW, kudos to the lady at the end of the bar wearing sunglasses all night. You reminded me of Chyna the wrastler. Talk about celebrity sighting... muhahaha.

Pleasantly surprised that an Izakaya actually exists in Phoenix and that it was actually pretty good! I took my parents here for a light lunch based on the reviews and proximity.  I was not disappointed.  Being a picky eater that has Izakayas at his disposal left and right, Yasu not only has friendly service, but also great ambiance, decor and food.  We started off with the fried tofu wrapped in Nori. The dashi broth was delicious. One of the better Agadashi Tofu dishes I have had.  Next we tried the king mushrooms. They were delicious.    The mushrooms had a great flavor and seasoning, and it was topped with tempura battered mini shrimp. Excellent dish! Highly recommended!  Next we had the Albacore Tataki Salad. The albacore was pretty fresh and nicely prepared, however I wasn't a fan of the dressing. A little too much vinegar and acid for my taste..  Finally we tried the Tonkatsu lunch special that came with salad and miso soup. Nice. Very good.  I was disappointed that they ran out of the black cod (one of my favorites at Izakayas) however I am sure it is absolutely delicious as well.  Please do come here for some pretty authentic Japanese bar/pub food! Great all around!

This place just opened. I must say a hidden treasure indeed amongst all the strip malls across Chandler.  My friend took me here last weekend and I must say, this place impressed me. Being a sushi snob from LA, the portions were quite large and in charge and the sushi was fresh.   Their Albacore was delicious. Melted in my mouth with the ginger and ponzu sauce. They also have some killer lunch specials and the staff have exotic eyes (one with blue eyes and one with a lazy). The tempura was also good- not oily at all and very fresh. Try their bento box lunches. Lots of food- most of it under $9 with edamame and miso.  Decor is gross but honestly come here for the sushi. It's really good for the price! (lunch for 4 was only $35!)

The sample grandpas and grandmas looked so sad. I felt bad and guilty that they had to do that as work. One grandpa was cutting up granola bars with all of his might.  I wanted to give him a round of a plause.    Everyone here was old and Caucasian. Some of the sample ladies spoke to me and my mom as if we just came off the boat or something speaking very slowly and clearly...  THISSSS   IS    BAGUETTE... WHICH IS BREAAAD FRESH DAILLYYYY.  I wanted to take the La Brea Bakery baguette and smack her across the face like Homey the Clown and say, WHYYY AREEE YOUUUU TALKINNNG TOO USSSS LIKE WE ARE A PETTTT???? Or I would have said... you know, you are using this under the name of La Brea Bakery, which is a well known brand from Los Angeles, now do you just use their packaging or is it because you want to act like your LA since Scottsdale is faux Hollywood?  Damn me for being the passive aggressive Asian I am. o___O   Apparently we were the ethnic delegation at Costco for the day.

I was ridiculously drunk by the time I came here. All I remember was:  1. a huge foam football helmet on some douche bag 2. pizza so oily it oozed out 3. wings that didn't taste spicy or sweet 4. Arizona college decals in the bathroom 5. Arizona losing to UCLA  Oh, and there was a huge football size scrolling marquee on the front. Unnecessary. Well, it was free because my buddy paid but other than that, I don't think i want to ever go back. At least there is no smoking in Arizona now.

Really great service.  Shige, the owner is a very gentle sushi slayer at the counter that really knows how to cut up his sashimi.  Huge fresh portions of sashimi that is sure to be a hit for a sushi novice or expert.  Other things tried-  Eel cucumber roll- pretty tasty.  California roll- eh. not my choice.  Agadashi Tofu- average  Scallops in birds nest- very tasty and great, recommended  Miso Black Cod- tasted not as fresh as the sashimi, but still above average  Chicken Karrage- it was more like chicken strips Japanese style, a littler under average  Overall, this place is quiet with pretty authentic food, but the service is top notch. Extremely friendly and personable.  I'd come here again.

Being someone from Arizona, I have never experienced a Phoenix Open until now.... and damn I have been missing out my entire life. I absolutely loved it.  It's a buffet for the eyes with hot plastic women and milfs, out of control outfits ranging from argyle sweaters to all white outfits, white trash and curly mulletinos, mustaches with handlebars... its seriously the best place hands down to people watch.  OK, I was across the lake of the hole 17 sky box on corporate row, but dude, whats not to like?  Free food---- GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD Free OPEN BAR ALL DAY---- GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD People watching with perfect weather outdoors getting tan- GOOOOOOD PORTABLE TOILETS WITH HAND SANITIZER----GOOOOOD  Oh everyone needs to come to the best PGA tour game ever. It's one big frat party. Only time after college where being drunk from 10:30am to 3:30am is acceptable. BRAVO SCOTTSDALE.

Delicious and super filling. 2 of these tamales will do the trick for me. Always go with the fresh selection and I will admit the beef tamales are one of the best tamales I have ever had. LOVE IT! I'm a huge fan especially when it comes to local vendors!

I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch. If that wasn't enough to stop making you eat here... I'll list some more reasons-  Agadashi tofu was more like watered down teriyaki sauce with a side of tofu mush.  Tempura with no tempura sauce, and it tasted old.  Waitress dropped an entire tray of ice water on my mom and didn't even apologize.  The best part was the table behind us with young children screaming... while the parentals were sake bombing like 18 year olds.  Clearly... a classy place if you ask me.  BTW, if you honestly give this place more than 3 stars, I really question your taste palate.

Apparently there are 2 names to this place. Clearly the marketing in that was well thought out....  re-posting what I already wrote---  I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
