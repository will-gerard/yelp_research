Ehhhh well this place is okay. I work in the area and thought I would give it a try. The food is nothing special, I will not be back. For one they only take cash, two nobody was wearing gloves well making your food, three the only use a microwave!  I watched the lady cash out someone before me touch the money and the register and than go make someone else's sandwich. I'd pass on that.

A great experience! Took my husbands truck in for a car wash after a camping trip and they really took car of me. They were so friendly and loved how much detail they really put into the cleaning of all the cars. Just going camping we had a lot of mud on the side. After cleaning the inside and outside the Manager came over to me and offered to re-wash the outside to really try and get the mud off the sides. I only paid to just get the basic wash so I wasn't really expecting it to be flawless so was impressed by them really wanting to get it perfect. While waiting I enjoyed a latte from their cafe which was really good. The place was busy and although I didn't eat there the food looked delicious! I definitely will be back.

Love the Henry, great service, great ambiance, great food & drinks. They have live music for brunch on weekend, wasn't too loud which was perfect!  The Henry will definitely remain one of my top favorites for brunch. They are fairly busy all the time, so just expect to wait a little while, but they always offer you to go to bar and get a drink or something while you wait.

Great ambiance, absolutely love the decor, very inviting and comfortable. The layout is great and not awkward when it's crowded. Went on a Friday night, good crowd great group of people.   They have a great brunch went on a Sunday and lots of TVs for game days! They have a DJ on Sunday's too . During the week they have a cute little coffee shop on the side for a quick coffee, pastry, and small snack that opens at 630 am. Great customer service easy to get a drink, definitely will be back!

So happy they finally opened one in North Scottsdale. Love the set up, two stories, great patio and great service. We went here opening week and the wait was a little long so they paid for a round of our drinks for being so patient. This has definitely become a regular place for us to go.  We love bringing friends and family here, even if it's just for a drink.
