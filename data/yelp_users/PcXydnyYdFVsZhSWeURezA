Unless you have a few hours of your life you don't mind wasting, DO NOT COME HERE!   My wife and a few friends decided to grab some happy hour food and beverages somewhere. when we arrived and sat down we asked about specials, the waiter replys with "oh,  um.... $3 draft and wells". we proceed to ask about food and margarita specials (that the sign behind us clearly states). he tells us "no". I then ask him "Are you Sure? Because that sign over there says differently". He then says "i'll check".   I was right.   strike 1..  After we order a drink we decided on some food. About  15 minutes after we order a group of about 12 or 13 business type people walked in......Well i'm not really sure what happen after this point but everything seemed to go down hill really fast.   Ok..... so i then ask the bartender to change the tv station from CBS News to the football game. (we are the only ones in there besides a person at the bar and the business types in the other room). He does this about 20 minutes after i asked as he obviously forgot until he saw me staring at him. Not too big of a deal.  25 minutes after ordering our appetizers we still have not seen our waiter or any sign of our food. He finally comes over to our table and says "you're food will be out shortly, our cooks are slacking" It's completely obvious to us that this guy forgot to put in our order.   Finally our food arrives! It was brought out by another gentlemen who exclaimed "Sorry about the wait folks, that big party over there (the business types) caught our cooks by suprise!   1. We ordered long before they even came in.  2. Your cooks got caught by surprise??!!!  So, they're not used to cooking when they go to work as a cook!  They got one order completely wrong. our friend who is a vegetarian, ordered the harvest sampler (the veggie sampler). They brought her the regular sampler consisting of beef chimi's burro's and other things. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes for her food.   After comping her meal we received our check. We asked the waiter again if he can split it up 3 ways (we had told him we would be doing this prior to ordering) "Sure, No problem he says". He returns 10 mins later only to tell us he can't split the check and we'll have to "figure it out"    My wife and the rest of our party except one, proceed to leave and wait for us outside while we "figure out" the check.  After deciding we would leave a poor and undeserved tip just to be nice, our waiter brings back our change.. no $1's. before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone.   At this point i'm tempted to walk out without leaving a tip but im a nice guy. So i stroll up to the bar to make change. The new bartender makes eye contact with me,  but doesn't say a word, turns around and proceeds to shuffle around the bar as he tries desperately to open a bottle of seagrams with no luck. After 5 minutes and not even a" i'll be right with you" or anything i walked out without leaving a tip. i have never done that before. EVER

I've been coming here for a few years now , over that time I've seen the prices go up and the clientele go down. This place has gotten to the point where I  can't even eat here.... $10 for a dozen wings???!! Another 1.00 to grill em??!! Jeez!! The wings are so small it's more like 7 or 8. Also they use paper menus!!! Gross and cheap!! It kills my appetite when i look down and see someone's week old food chunks and grease spots on my menu! The whole experience left me feeling like I need to wash my hands.

This place is cool! Its technically a gay bar but its more of an everybody type bar. It reminds me of the now defunct GLAM that used to be on 32nd st and Indian School. The sound system is awesome especially for a dive bar and the drinks are STRONG!!! Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is cause no smoking patio :(
