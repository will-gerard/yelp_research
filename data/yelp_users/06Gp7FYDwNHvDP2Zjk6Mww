Good size portions, delicious food. My whole family really liked it all! I think we have found our new go to spot for Chinese takeout.

This is by far my family's favorite go to spot for dim sum. We absolutely love it and take friends and family as often as possible. They have a better selection on the weekend. Yum!

Absolutely delicious. Tried a couple of rolles suggested to us be fellow patrons, and we were not disappointed! The primo roll was fantastic! The sushi chef was so nice and talented! He is willing to customize anything you want. Younlike it spicy? He will spice it up! You want crunchy? He will add crunch! Loved it! We enjoyed oirbdate night there very much and will be back soon to try more rolls! Yum!

Yum! Food was good. Too many flies hanging around though, that was annoying. Cute little house. Coffee was better than the average cafe. We will go back!

This is one of our absolute favorite places to pick up dinner. Love, love, LOVE the teriyaki chicken. And the macaroni salad is amazingly delicious. We always get extras so we can munch for dinner and lunch the next day! Yummmm! In fact, I think we will go tonight!

Although their food is extremely overpriced, we enjoy going here every other year as a treat to ourselves. The sunday brunch is yummy. I greatly enjoy their eggs benedict and my son can almost finish the gigantic breakfast burrito.  The cheesecake is, of course, fantastic! We have tried several flavors and have yet to be disappointed by any of them. We would go more often and I would have given 5 stars, if they weren't so overpriced.

Absolutely love their fajita chicken! It is so delicious and flavorful! I wish i had the recipe! We go out of our way to shop here as we live about 25 min away. We make tacos several times a month and have tried other, closer, carnicerias but always end up back here! Good food is worth the drive!   The only drawback is that sometimes there can be confusion when ordering due to most of their staff only speaking spanish or very, very litte english. However, they are always super friendly and quick to fix any errors. And it seems that occasionally we are overcharged. We always get roughly the same order and the price differs anywhere from $20 something to $40 something. Love the crema here as well and my hubby loves the steak with their marinade. In fact, we are going to shop here tonight! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

I bought a Groupon for these people and couldn't ever reach them to schedule my appointment! I left several messages and no one even bothered to return my call. So disappointing. Don't bother with them!!!

Yummy pizza and deliciously hot suicide/insane wings! The sandwiches are good as well. Great customer service! We have ordered several times and once our order was incomplete but they fixed the issue promptly. We will order from them again for sure. Zucchini sticks are tasty when they arrive crispy and fresh!

Absolutely loved the food! Hubby and I went in for our monthly brunch date and were not disappointed. I had the pick two benedicts....DELICIOUS! The carnitas was my fav. Wish they had a better assortment of creamer for their coffee other than that, we have no complaints. Great service, great food, can not wait to go back!
