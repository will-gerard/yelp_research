Loved this Hampton Inn! Staff was super friendly. Close to restaurants and shopping. Clean, comfy, and well maintained hotel, close to the highway and perfect for a quick getaway from Chicago area.

Loved it!!! Got to ride the stage coach, the train and enjoy a great gunfight/stunt show. Food was great, and the Roughriders were the best. Super friendly and all the kids seemed to like it. Definitely a must do if you have time in the Phoenix area. Get the park pass for $15.

This place was amazing. Wish we lived closer to this restaurant. We tried it on a whim. The flatbread was perfect. The caprese salad wonderful.  I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm! Dessert was the BEST. A greek yogurt pie with fresh berries. Delicious... They had Croatian wines on the menu, which we had to try. Lovely wines. The drink suggested was Anatasia, strawberries with basil and vodka, quite tasty.

I agree with these reviews.  This is the worst chain restaurant. It was late evening, no one in the restaurant and the staff totally ignored us and wouldn't even bother seating us. WTF indeed.  We left and will never, ever go back there. Too many other choices in Las Vegas to be treated like well, I hate to say it but none paying customers.  Now that I read the reviews, I'm actually thankful that we never got seated!

We stopped here because we couldn't resist the name. Pizza was good. Crust seemed to be whole grain. I had the Pear martini, and was not impressed. Appetizer was the garlic cheese bread which was pretty good. Service was ok. plenty of parking this area of town helped, but not sure we will visit again if we get back to Phoenix.
