Over the years I have been to the Herberger for many performances. I have enjoyed each and every one, with Othello being my favorite.  The outside plaza has a variety of sculptures in dance poses.  The lobby is nice with a glass front and "grand" staircase.  I haven't used the ticket booth so I can't speak about those concerns.  There are actually two performance rooms, but every show I have seen has been in the 800 seat theatre.  I haven't always been able to get center seats so I've discovered that there are good seats throughout the house.  The balcony area is roomy and comfortable as well.  The performances that I have seen have been first-rate from sets, to costumes, dances, sound and acting.  It's a wonderful venue to see wonderful performances.

I'd just like to supplement Shannon's review since I agree with it....  It's important to know everything is cash only at the Wildlife World Zoo, no credit cards.  So, you'll need cash for tickets, food, the gift shop, $1 to ride the merry-go-round, $2 for the boat ride, not sure how much the train and sjyride are, and quarters so that you can get food to feed the giraffes, ducks and wild animals at the petting zoo.  I think the giraffe feeding is the best part of the experience.  Watch small kids in the petting zoo...the animals are very enthusiastic about receiving their treats, not as docile as most petting zoo animals.

I only ding it a star for the singing.  As with all of this style restaurant they do the obnoxiously loud birthday singing that makes you have to pause your conversation and wait, and wait...and...they seem to average 3-5 birthdays per meal that I have there.  How about a little cake and candle and a nice simple, "Happy birthday!"  The food is great and there is a variety of dishes...something to please everyone...vegetarians, experimental eaters, the burger guy, and me -- the picky one.   Dan mentioned that he didn't like the fancy stuff -- they actually have a big thing on their menu that asks you to just tell them how you want it -- you can pick out what type of bun, what goes on it, etc.  So...if you don't want a fancy bun, ask for a plain one, no one bats an eye.  They have a dangerous thing -- unlimited french fries.  For a whopping 49 cents you can make them unlimited garlic fries.  Also...if you ask they will bring you a side of onion straws or fries while you wait for your meal...so far they've always been free.

I seemed to be getting lured into JoAnns regularly of late.  I have several friends who are crafters who want to just stop by when we are in the neighborhood...  I am amazed.  They have everything.  Whatever you want to make, I'd bet they have the stuff for it.  Just walking through the aisles I thought of 4,876 different things that *I* could make with ease because of the wonderful goodies they had.  Of course, I know I won't sit down and make anything.  I don't have the patience to learn how to thread a sewing machine...maybe if someone gave me a self-threading one, I'd think about it.  Maybe.  ....but with all the crafty goodness of JoAnns...I COULD.  And a store that makes you believe, well that's Disneyriffic!

I remember when this was Tony Romas....after it reopened as "the new Italian Place" I tried it and though, "eh, it's okay."  I went back today to meet a friend and.... mmmmmm mmmmm mmmmm.  If you've read my other reviews, please know that I do eat food other than chicken Parmesan.  I've just been eating a lot of it lately.  So...I had the chicken parm and it was delicious!  The breading was amazing.  I feel, because of my frequent C.P. encounters, and because I have an Italian husband who likes to cook for me, I am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to good C.P....and this was terrific.  The decor is nice.  Charming and relaxing.  The booths are huge.  The service was great.  The water tasted horrible.  And that is my review.

We drove to the Arrowhead area to see if the Irish Restaurant has opened.  I read the name to myself three times so that I would remember it and could look it up when I got home...Lis Doon Varna.  Obviously, it isn't open yet, or I wouldn't be reviewing Texas Roadhouse.    We drove across the street and looked between Buca and Texas and decided we've been consuming enough Italian food lately.  I liked it.  It was louder than I prefer; but most restaurants are these days.  Really, I'm only in my 30s, but I'm ancient at the same time.  The birthday gimmick of bringing out a saddle and yelling Yee-Haw really should not happen.  Especially at two tables right next to me.  I also feel the concept of throwing your peanut shells on the floor is awful, terrible, oh, I'm going there....horrific.  Why is this something that a restaurant would encourage?  Bits of food and spittle being thrown on the floor in a place where you eat...YUMMY!  Now for the good...  as others have mentioned the bread and cinnamon butter is yummy.  The food is good.  It has always been cooked the way it is ordered.  The portions are large.  They will make substitutions.  The people next to us ordered these artery-clogging loaded baked potatoes that looked absolutely scrumptious.  The service has always been top-notch every time I've been there.  The waiters are attentive, fill your drinks, get the orders correct, and offer suggestions.  The service is better than what you usually receive in nicer restaurants.  That about wraps it up.

Really.... I want to write a review, but Lauren V said all I wanted to say.  I loved the light and mirror effect room.  I wasn't sure I would call it art, but it was cool as all cool.  The charred wood installation piece is fantastic to stare at...velvet rope and all.  I can't say I blamed the kid, I would have loved to run through it myself.  They seem to get some of the greatest traveling shows -- the Secrets of the Forbidden Palace, the Rembrandts, there was an impressionist one, Ansel Adams,Curves, the evening dresses, the Himilayan Art, Degas....  It's large enough that you can spend hours there, but broken up into sections so you don't feel you have to do it all.  I hear they show movies there too!  Tuesday afternoon/evening = free!

Do you ever get that conspiracy theory moment where you think that a business is actually some sort of front for something much more sinister?  La Fondita is a little hole-in-the-wall mom and pop "restaurant" in beautiful down town El Mirage.  Please do not drive to downtown El Mirage based on my past sentence.  The "beautiful down town El Mirage" statement is what one might call sarcasm.  Remember when you were a kid, and you'd enter a neighborhood and your mom would tell you to lock the doors?  Now, you are picturing the beauty.  Moving on...  La Fondita is closed almost as much as it is open.  I drove by last Saturday at 8pm and they were closed.    I usually just get my food to go from the little window.  The dining room, if we are calling it that, sort of makes you wonder if you have made the right choice eating there.  ...but...why, oh, why would I go back?  I really, really like the food.  Some additional fun facts:  Once, the husband, ordered some sort of burro/burrito type thing that cost $4.95.  He asked for guacamole and sour cream.  When we went to pay he saw that he was charged $2.95 for the guacamole and $1.00 for the sour cream.  He almost doubled the price for his meal!  I laughed heartily.  When I went yesterday to pick up an order I discovered another comical sign... Due to increasing cost of fuel and paper products they are charging a $1 per take out order...for me to drive there and pick it up they are going to charge me an extra $1!  Lovely.  So...anyone know any good recipes for salsa?  It seems I need to learn to make my own.

First, what's with the other reviewers whining about the location?  The metropolitan area does go beyond their cozy little caves in the east valley!  Moving on...hey look it's a non-chain place to eat in the Phoenix area -- AMAZING!  The food was excellent, the service was great, it wasn't overly crowded (i.e. no long wait), and it wasn't one of those pretentious "we're a cool Italian over priced fancy place."  It was the perfect place to get good food, relax and have a great time.  Something the west valley definitely has going over the east!

The food is excellent!  There is a large variety of items to choose from and you can get full meals or a la carte.  Portions are generous.  After dinner you are treated to a cup of ice cream.  The negative:  I really wish they would replace the booths.  They look like they have been there since the 50s and haven't been cleaned all that much.  Since the food is so good, and they seem to keep the place clean (they are often seen cleaning while I am there) I can only guess that it is decades of stains...

I am not a manicure/pedicure expert, so my review is more about customer service.  I decided my daughter might like something girlie so I took her for her first manicure and they were so patient with a toddler and made her feel special!

I haven't been to a wax museum in over a decade...I remember when you had to stay behind the velvet rope...the interaction was great!  You can curl up next to Hef, try to dunk on Shaq, join the victory at Nascar (with your own flags to wave), but on a dress and pretend to marry Brad (even though the sign says George, it looks a lot more like Brad to me), and...you can touch J Lo's butt and make her blush.  I love that you can get up close with the figures and play along with the Blue Man Group.  At $24 a person it is a bit pricey for an hours worth of entertainment...but it was entertaining enough for me to make it worth it.  The haunted house bit is extremely short...it was well done, but maybe a minute from start to finish.  They have student discounts, and I've heard there are coupons, so you might want to look for those in advance.  Go in, relax and make a fool of yourself!

It had been a while since I had been to Mike's so I was excited when the Groupon was available.  We ended up getting multiple Groupons for them...which I now regret.  The food is the same as it always was...good....the chicken is oddly thin...but the taste is good.  Here's what I have learned that is supremely disappointing.  If you go in with kids you are pretty much shunned and ignored.  The waiter who greeted us simply held up four fingers to us.  I said yes.  He walked to the table and looked back to us.  Apparently, we weren't going fast enough because he just laid the menus on the table and walked away.  It continued like this...we had to get up to ask for the check.  The waitress only came to our table to bring our food, and the boxes and check.  She NEVER checked in on us.    This is how it is any time we go in with children.  There were 7 other table occupied while we were in...two others with kids...I watched and it was the same for them!

I must admit this is my 6th time seeing the Blue Man Group (once in Chicago, once in New York, three times at the Luxor, and now the Venetian show).  This time I decided on........Poncho Seating.... first row.   Now I can say I've pretty much set every where and there isn't a bad seat...  The music is fantastic...upbeat, getcha going.  Audience participation is a fact at the shows.  They definietly know the audience is there, and let's everyone know they see them individually.    There are some new bits to the show that are wonderful additions. ..which I won't spoil for anyone.  The only thing that I can specifically remember that isn't in the new show is the Go Ask Alice piece.  Humor is a big part of the show.  Let's see, blue guys, paint, drums, twinkies, neon, televisions, lcd lights, humor, pvc pipes, more paint, captian crunch, and lots and lots of crepe paper/toliet tissue....  By the way....all that paper ends up in the front row and you sort of get to crawl out after the show....

I visited for a Sunday lunch (yesterday).    The food was good.  . .your typical bar food but the portions were quite large.  The server was friendly and prompt.  I left happy.

Okay....my review for this one is the same as the other one on Bell...they are pretty much identical except there is more parking at this location....and occassionally you get a distracted server....but for the most part the service is good.  I only ding it a star for the singing.  As with all of this style restaurant they do the obnoxiously loud birthday singing that makes you have to pause your conversation and wait, and wait...and...they seem to average 3-5 birthdays per meal that I have there.

Since this is our home away from home, it's about time I put in a review.  Seriously, Kim already has our order at the counter waiting for us after she sees me pull into the parking lot.  If that doesn't say how much we like it....and how often we visit....well...it does.   The pizza is fantastic.  My husband moved here from New York and getting him to not make faces at every pizza place we went to was a challenge, until he met Barros.  We have a convert!  The environment is casual, the staff is friendly (By the way, I saw someone posted about a not nice cashier, about two years ago there was a particularly unfriendly cashier but she hasn't been there for some time), they are patient with my little ones.  It's the place that I let me three year old pay for the meal because it doesn't hold up a line and the staff smiles and interacts with them.  The lunch special prices are pretty much so low it's cheaper than eating at home.  A slice of pizza, salad bar, and a soda for $4.25?  A slice for $1.75?

I have to tell you that I love T.G. I. Fridays.  The food is great...especially their Jack Daniel's grilled selections....  ...but this location has the worst service of any food chain in the northwest valley.  I drive across to the Friday's at 59th Avenue and Bell so that I can have someone actually come see that I am there within 20 minutes, maybe take my order and refill my drink once or twice....

I've been using Paul's Pest & Termite Control for several years now and I am very happy with their service.  We had a technician out again today for the monthly service.  They ask about any problems and concerns that you have, are friendly, suggest that you don't allow the cats to ingest the poison (I would have never thought that was bad!  Uh, I'm kidding, but it's still nice that they remind you).  My only problem is the billing...they allow you to set up a credit card that they will automatically bill each time you have the service.  This makes it a little more convenient than having to give them the card and sign the forms each month.  However, they often forget to bill it.  In fact, the bill that I have now shows the last two weren't paid.  I used to call and sit on the phone until they figured it out.  Now, I am waiting until they decide to take care of it on their own.  It's an odd call to make, "Will you please take my money?"

We opted for a Saturday night dinner and a movie at the Arizona Center and decided to visit My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.  It was remarkably uncrowded for 7pm on a Saturday (Why is it that no one goes to the Arizona Center?).  We were seated right away.  We skipped the patio because, um, it's June in Arizona, and were taken to a 1/2 table 1/2 both towards the back.    We cracked up at the drinks.  Maybe they are generous, or maybe they get tired of refilling, but the glasses were at least 32 ounce.  This was good, but not what we'd expect from this type of restaurant.   I'm going to say that the food was good but not terrific.  It should be noted that I wouldn't even know what Greek food is and I ordered the Italian Chicken Parm because when it comes to food, I live on the whatever-is-opposite-of-wild side.  The server was personable and prompt.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time...so truly no complaints here!

For a brand new theatre Ultras Star seems very old school.  I suppose we are spoiled by the treat of having AMC and Harkins create "luxury" theatres to spoil us.  Truly - have you seen movie theatres in the rest of the country?  We have it good!  Anyway, I had heard that it was more expesnive than Harkins and AMC...which was said for me.  I worked at a movie theatre my 16th through 18th years.  It took me years to get used to even paying for movies, let alone paying close to $10.    However....and this is a BIG however...the movie theatre is all digital.  It makes a difference in the quality.  Immensely.  The picture was wonderful.  I would guess that digital is the extra you get for $9.75 (which really is just a bit more than the other two).  I did notice the concession stand prices were high too...but concessions aren't my thing, so it didn't bother me.  What else... ample parking friendly cashier movable arm rests  Do you think if I check "No" on the Good for kids box it will keep people from taking their infants to the movies?  Or taking 3 year olds to 9pm Friday showings of rated R movies?  Sigh.  Probably not.

Bronco Billy's was open for about two years before I finally visited.  I just wouldn't guess that a place called Bronco Billy's would have a good pie.  Maybe it's discrimination, but Uncle Vito, Big Al, Cousin Tony, those are the guys that you look to for a good pizza.  I was hungry.  I was close by.  It smelled good.  I went in.  It's just a pizza joint, nothing fancy, you order at the counter, have a seat and they bring your pizza to you.  It took a while for the pizza...which depending on your point of view could be good or bad.  I would have liked to have waited less, however, my pizza was freshly made.  It hadn't been sitting out.  It hadn't just been put in the oven to reheat.  It was fresh.  It was also huge.  I got one slice, which I ate part of, took home, ate part of for lunch the next day, and part of for lunch the next day.  Yep, three meals out of one slice.    On a side note, if you plan to eat left over pizza from anywhere invest in a toaster oven.  It makes a huge difference and is leaps and bounds better than pizza reheated in the microwave.  You'll be happy you did.  Back to BBP... there aren't any trash cans so you are supposed to leave your plates and stuff on the tables.  I don't know why I always feel weird leaving a dirty table behind...

*Open*Open*Open*  Apparently, Lis Doon Varna was supposed to open in March.  It is now July.    There isn't any information provided on the building as far as an estimated opening date.  The website just has pictures of construction.  No information at all.  Maybe I am overly anxious for a new non-chain restaurant, but I really do believe it has been years that this has been in progress...  Will re-review once it opens...

We love the Little Gym.  Our little gymsters can crawl around and play on mats and beams.  The laugh, they smile, oh and they shed a tear here and there.  Balls, sticks, bubbles, songs -- lots of activities to entertain infants!

No such thing as zero stars, eh?  By the way, they have moved to a new location.  If you want to make your kid cry, go ahead and sign them up!  This was my daughter's first experience with a true dance class after taking "dance" classes where the kid's more or less just had fun to music.  She was so excited to have her pink leotard, her little ballet skirt and a tap and ballet shoes.  The first day of class I discovered that some of the girls in the class had already taken the same class several times, one for at least a year...but they weren't progressed to another class, the classes were designated by age, not by level.  So, the teacher went through the movements and expected the girls to follow along.  She did not stop to help them and showed frustration at then for not immediately following along.  Did I mention this is a class for THREE YEAR OLDS and it's the FIRST DAY OF CLASS?  Managing your expectations was definitely not part of the training here!  I thought about complaining, but then realized the instructor (who did not introduce herself) was actually one of the owners.  I decided to take her to a class on a different day, with a different instructor, hoping she would be less intense with such young children just starting out.  I was wrong.  This class was with the other owner, who opted to make multiple children cry.  Keeping in mind that this is a class of three year olds and it was only the second class, the instructor yelled at the girls for fidgeting while they were waiting for the other girls to take their turns.  My daughter came running out of the room and said she was told she would not be allowed to dance if she couldn't stand still until it was her turn.  Why anyone would think this was the way to treat such a young child is beyond me comprehension.  I left two voicemail messages, sent an email, and a letter informing the Dance Project that we would not be continuing classes and to cancel all future enrollments after two classes.  They have an "automatic renewal" policy so I wanted to be sure that we were not automatically renewed.  No one returned my calls, my emails, or my letter.  Four weeks later, I received a call requesting my next payment.  Not only did they not return my calls, they either didn't notice, or didn't care that my daughter had not been in the class for  four weeks, but they wanted more money.  As a teacher, I want to ensure that my children develop a love of learning.  It is crucial that early teachers and learning experiences by positive so that children will want to continue to learn.  Fortunately, my daughter loves dancing, so she was willing to try another class (at another school of course) and she has been taking classes there for weeks now -- not only does she love it, she is thriving and learning quickly.
