We have had 2 kids go here and had a great experience.  Originally we liked the fact they didn't require our kids go 5 days a week, they were flexible.  The staff is great and care for the kids.  We had our son in one classroom where he wasn't doing as well, he switched to another classroom and now he's thriving.  They were very accomodating.

This is a typical scottsdale establishment.  The guys behind the counter don't really have time for you and just want to sell something.  The range is difficult to get onto if you just walk in and nothing special.  I live in the valley and there are much better places to go for range time.

My family LOVES Pure.  They have a good happy hour and have always have great food.  My 7 year old son asks to go all the time.  We have also had multiple birthday reservations in the back room and had great experiences.

My family stayed at the Grand yesterday and ate at The Lobby Grill today for lunch.  The prices are kind of high but considering its in the hotel that is expected.  That being said, I, my wife and out kids all really liked everything we ordered.  It seemed kind of like your run of the mill hotel restaurant so our bar was pretty low but we were pleasantly surprised.  The french dip was great, the brussel sprouts were delicious and the pizza cookie at the end was the best we have had living here in the valley, it rocked.

My neighbor uses these guys.  His trees have been growing onto my side of the fence, usually I don't care but its a mesquite and it drops junk all year long, i've had enough.  Today, while Sunny Arizona was out, i asked them to cut it back away from my property.  They said "ask the homeowner, if we do it who is going to pay us..."  I guess for the $60+ he pays all they do is blow leaves around.  I would not use their service if this is the mentality...

I have used Bowdacious Creations for many years now and I am always happy with the results.  Marie is great, informative and will not sleep until the product is done right.  Whenever I have friends in need of shirts I always send them to Bowdacious.  Great Job!

My wife and I very much enjoyed our breakfast at Butters.  We were in the area on our anniversary and wanted something with a lot of options as we have completely different palettes.  This was perfect.  I loved my corned beef skillet and oreo pancake side.  We will be back again.

My wife and I tripped across this place while on our anniversary in the area.  We didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprise.  We had reservations for dinner but ended up doing happy hour instead.  We ordered 6 items and all were great.  We really enjoyed the steak and brussels sprout skewers.  The pig wings were a great take on an old favorite as well.  We will go again when we are in the area.  Compliments to the chef.
