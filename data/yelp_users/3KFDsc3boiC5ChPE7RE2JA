I absolutely can't get enough of South Mountain. I used to come here occasionally over the last couple of years, but now that I have my motorcycle, I find myself coming here frequently. The ride to the top is great. Once you're at the top, there's plenty of parking, and also benches including a covered lookout. The only thing I would improve are the roads. Bicyclist live to ride to the top and back down, however there isn't enough room for them to ride on the side of the road without looking like they are going to fall off.

Great park to take the family for a nice picnic and watch the lake. There's a library right next to it as well as a skate park. I like to skateboard on occasion and the skate park is perfect for us non pros. There are high schoolers that like to just hang out there and do "extra curricular activities" at times, but overall, a great park.

I have seen this place when I passed by going to work, and decided to give it a go. I had taken my wife here for dinner along with a few friends. I can definitely say this is a great spot for groups. You get your own personal chef and the staff is great. I've always wanted to eat at a sushi place where they cook the food in front of you. I was afraid I would eventually get bored watching the chef prepare our meal, however he kept our interest making jokes, interacting, and doing food and knife tricks. I highly recommend this restaurant. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you can't be seated until everyone in your group is present.

I am a frequent Walmart shopper because of the great prices. However, this location in particular needs ALOT of improvement. I found that the employees weren't very knowledgable of their products or the location of the products as opposed to other locations I have visited in the valley. The employees seemed as if they haven't had any customer service experience. I will gladly drive to a further location because of the better experience alone.

Very well kept. Employees are knowlagable of the locations of any item. There's even a Starbucks inside to get your coffee fix or buzz on while you do your shopping. Can get a little crowded at times, so I find it best to do shopping during the mid day.

I had the pleasure of staying here for my birthday for now the 2nd year in a row. And I must say, Aria is THE place to stay if your looking for a classy, elegant, yet edgy and modern hotel. This hotel is just beautiful inside and out. The rooms are spacious and well designed, and the bed, O...M...G! The staff is wonderful. I even got a free upgrade to a high floor room when they seen that it was my birthday. The restaurants are good, but a little on the pricey side. Same with the table games. During the day, I found that the cheapest table game was about $15-$25 min bet. But again, that's to be expected from a hotel like this. Needless to say, I will definitely be back. See ya next year!

What a great place to take your family for some ice cream. My children absolutely love this place. A wide variety of flavors to choose from, and they all taste great. I'll definitely be back.

Absolutely a great place to enjoy some brews after work. Has a plethora of different beers that I'm sure everyone would like. It can get a little crowded, but that's to be expected. Bartenders were friendly, and the doorman was hilarious and easy to talk to. Will definitely be back.

Terrible service. Let's start from the beginning. The person who took my order had an attitude as if he hated his job. I got the 20 piece wings which comes in 3 flavors. He didn't even know that, and looked at me like I was crazy when I told him the 3 flavors I wanted. While waiting, I got to listen to the cooks argue about why the food isn't made in a timely manner. To top that, when I received my food, I was asked for it back because they gave me someone else's take out order. I didn't even get an apology for the confusion. This place needs to step it up.

Starbucks is already known for their great service and drinks. This location definitely exceeds my expectations. Let's start by saying I am an avid coffee drinker. The first hour or 2 of my mornings start by enjoying coffee at a Starbucks. The employees here are great, friendly, personable, and the drinks are never a let down. When I come to this location, I know that I'll be greeted by my first name when I walk in, and have my caramel macchiato with extra caramel and whip cream already rung up when I reach the register. The only question they ask me drink wise is if I would like it hot or over ice that day. Perfect!
