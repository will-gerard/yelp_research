I came here a few nights ago for the Carnivores Tour.   1st, I thought that it was super cool that I got to ride the light rail for the first time & it was free! (I love freebies!)  Apparently, if you have a ticket to an event at the US Airways center, you can ride the Metro Valley Light Rail for free that day, starting 4 hours prior to show time, until the end of the day.  Just be prepared to show your physical ticket if asked. Concert parking is always nerve-wracking and expensive, so I was very appreciative of this stress-free option. Keep in mind, if the event runs past 11pm, the furthest east you'll be able to travel is 44th & Washington.   Large venue with an excellent sound system. Jared's (30 STM) acoustic set and Linkin Park's everything sounded amazing! Large pit area; nice for moshing.  The stage is a little weird.  I'm used to the stage extending a little further out towards the audience, but it was pretty far back.  I was looking forward to trying G'rill Dogs vegan options after reading a Yelp friend's review, but they were closed the whole night. :(  There were some Mexican food options which served salsa and guac as vegan options, however, I opted for a stadium pretzel which was so hard and stale that you could stone one to death if thrown. They may want to ban those from the auditorium. I ended up throwing it, & therefore my $5 away. $6 bottled water, which did not go to waste.   I don't know if I lucked up or not, but I didn't have to walk far to find a restroom.It wasn't as huge as you'd think for that size venue, but there was no line so I didn't have to wait.   Security was in full effect and I felt safe waiting at the light rail station after midnight.   Also, when I was purchasing the tickets for this event, on the 1st day of sale, my ticket window guy was awesome! He snagged the area/section that I wanted and set me up with an account so that if my tickets were lost or stolen I'd be able to get a re-print. Sweet!

After an entire day of fair, food, and fun at the AZ State Fair, we returned to my vehicle to find that it wouldn't start. It was after 10pm, and I was beginning to have a mini freak-out session. My car is only 2 years old and it's Japanese... Isn't it supposed to last, like, forever?! So I do what most adults would do and I call my dad, who lives over 1500 miles away. He tells me that it's likely just the battery.  So I call ERS for a jump-start and while waiting for them I begin the search for who on earth is going to be open this late to sell me a car battery. I thought all was hopeless until I ran across the listing for this AutoZone.   I called the store directly to confirm their hours and was beyond relieved when he said that they were open until midnight AND they had a battery in stock for my vehicle. After getting the battery jumped, GPS led me to this store, which was only minutes away.  The man who assisted me was helpful and patient. He showed me the different options, explained the differences in brands and warranties, and didn't pressure me into spending more money than needed. With his guidance, I chose a battery, his coworker installed it into my vehicle, and took the old one away. (The coworker seemed a tad annoyed, but he still got the job done.)  It may not seem like that big of a deal, but to someone who was stranded in an unfamiliar area they saved the day.   Oh, y se hablan español aquí también.

I came here on a Saturday night, with a Groupon. It's a small establishment with a compact parking lot, and both were jam-packed. Luckily, someone was leaving as I was pulling into the lot, so I was able to grab a spot. (I don't know if they have an overflow lot, but they should.)   Once inside, I quickly observed the "Please Wait to be Seated" sign.  We were asked how many were in our party, after which the hostess/waitress (they seem to be one in the same) scurried off to assess the availability.  As said earlier, it was packed, and there were others also waiting.  I was thinking we'd have to wait forever and that my starving spirit animal would come bursting out of my abdomen, like in those beef jerky commercials. But we ended up waiting no more than about 5 minutes before we were shown to a booth. (I love booths!)  DESIGNATED VEGAN MENU: There's a vegan menu inserted inside of their regular menu.  The waitress said that patrons keep taking them out, so if you want the vegan menu and don't see it, just ask for one.  The vegan options include appetizers, hot stuffed sandwiches, pasta, calzone, pizzas, and desserts.  It wasn't listed on the menu, but they also have a vegan cheesecake, which you can get topped with chocolate syrup or mixed berry sauce.    My order: Veggieballs in buffalo hot sauce -  They are described as vegan meatballs, so I'm thinking faux-beef "meat" balls. I was pleasantly surprised when I cut into one and found actual vegetables: peas, string beans, carrots, & corn. They were positively delicious. A slightly crispy coating covered in a proper buffalo sauce, which had a legit heat level. Excellent dish for only $5.95. Comes w/ vegan ranch and carrot sticks.   Vegan Spaghetti with soy sausage, $8.50 - (Beautiful presentation.) The pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce and the soy sausage were bland, however.  Aside from flavor, I don't know what to say that it was lacking. A dash of this? A splash of that? Not sure, but it was a pretty big boring bowl of blah. I kept furiously twirling my fork in the saucy mix, thinking that maybe the flavor was at the bottom somewhere, clicking its heels thrice and trying to get back home, but no luck. If you avoid salt/seasoning (and flavor), as well as meat, then this is your dish. I liked the vegan garlic bread though.    Dessert- Vegan cheesecake w/ mixed berry sauce, $6.50 - I never ate cheese before going vegan, but I used to eat cheesecake (weird, I know), so I do have something with which to compare vegan versions. I have had some better-than-real-cheesecake vegan cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them. I did not like it. The cheesecake had a weird, grainy, earthy taste to it. And it was like, almost smooth & creamy, (*singing* Ooooh, we're 1/2 way theeeere...) but it didn't quite make it there.  Silver lining? The crust and mixed berry sauce were both good.  Angel bites, $4.95 - (If you've ever been to France or New Orleans, think beignets, except here, they are vegan.) They cover theirs with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they offer you one of 3 dipping sauces: agave, chocolate, or caramel. (The caramel is NOT vegan, fyi.) I chose the chocolate. O-M-G. These suitably named bites of awesomeness brought me life. They came out hot, fresh & ready to be devoured. This is one of those treats that you want to eat right away because you know they won't taste the same later. But they give you so many! (Which is a great thing!) You can easily share this dessert with 2 or more people.   Non vegan: My non-veggie DD got the Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer, and the Cajun Chicken Alfredo pasta w/ shrimp added. She liked the pasta, but said it was definitely spicy.      Nice ambience, especially for dates. I don't know if they take reservations, but I suggest asking, especially for busy weekend nights.  As busy as they were, the staff was still nice and attentive. The owner was making rounds and asking patrons how their meals were. Cool little bistro. Great for vegans dining with omnivores.  I'll go back for more buffalo Veggieballs and Angel Bites.

I'm a big fan of the Loving Hut chain. Each is individually owned & operated, so when visiting a Loving Hut in a new city, for the first time, I try to go in with no real expectations as far as the menu is concerned.  When I moved to PHX last year I tried this location.  I ordered the Hawaiian Burger & the golden wontons to go. To my dismay, the "burger" wasn't a burger at all. It was a weird white-looking soy substance, which I couldn't identify, & my golden wontons were more like blackened. I was put off & did not return for a long while.   For some reason, maybe it was the sweet little ladies who work there, I felt compelled to give them another try. I am SO glad I did. Major improvements across the board, & they have recently revamped their menu.     My fav appetizers: - Golden Wontons have been consistently fried to golden perfection.  - Pan-fried Dumplings are yummy & the sauce is delicious.   Fav entrees: - Guru Fried Rice is so addictively (not a real word) delicious. Something about that curry spice on the brown rice (you can choose white or brown rice); I can't go a week without it!  - Noble Broccoli, is a vegan "beef" & broccoli dish. The soy beef is savory, and the broccoli, though crunchy, is soaked in a mouth-watering brown sauce. My non-veg*n friends really love this dish.   - Sweet & Sour Divine is their vegan sweet & sour chicken. It's simply perfect. The "chicken" is encased in perfectly battered & fried balls, dressed in a classic sweet & sour sauce, with pineapples, red & green peppers, & onions. So yummy!  - Spicy Cha Cha, which reminds me of shrimp, less the fleshy, fishy taste. It is very flavorful, and the menu now offers tartar sauce as an option. I tried it this way last week & went back 3 more times afterwards! Some of the best vegan tartar sauce around! Also with the new menu, this dish is now offered with your choice of fries or steamed veggies. Get it with fries for a "fish & chips" type meal. This dish is yam based, as opposed to soy, so it's also a good option for those who avoid soy.   - Loving Lemongrass is hard to describe. Thin slices of lightly breaded faux chicken deliciously seasoned. Muy sabrosa! Kinda like Pringles; once you pop, you can't stop!   The entree portions are plentiful and I always have left overs (unless I'm sharing my dish).  If you're in the mood for a sandwich, try the new Ocean Sandwich. I was a little skeptical at first but it was so good! That amazing tartar sauce really compliments this sandwich; I asked for extra sauce. Yum!   Speaking of that tartar sauce (again)... The menu offers a side of yam protein, which is basically a plain version of the Spicy ChaCha pieces. Be sure to ask for it fried, with a side of fries and Voilà: a fried shrimp & fries basket. Don't forget the tartar sauce!!  The Hawaiian burger is one of my favorites from the LH chain. At this location you have to ask for a "burger" patty, otherwise you'll get that funky white soy patty, which I've just learned is supposed to be a "chicken" patty. (Get the burger patty instead & leave happy.)  Is it dessert time? Good, because Loving Hut has one of the BEST vegan cheesecakes on earth. Seriously. Been around the world and I-I-I, I can't find a vegan cheesecake this good! That's all I'll say. Try it! Yummy ice cream flavors too: chocolate, cherry chocolate chip, vanilla. If you avoid soy, ask for the ice cream made with coconut milk.   When you dine in you get a yummy bowl of hot lentil soup. The drinking water is fruit-infused, usually with oranges; it's very refreshing. Service is not fast, so if you have a set or timed lunch break, you'll want to call ahead for a carry out order.  (They have Eco-friendly to-go containers.) My food is always hot & fresh, and I'm typically in no hurry so I have no complaints regarding the wait.   The owners are so sweet and friendly; they always greet you with smiling faces. The decor is simple and elegant; it has a very peaceful ambiance.   So to sum it up, this Loving Hut has become one of my all time favorite dining spots. Awesome vegan food that will please & satisfy veg*ns & omnivores alike.

La Grande Orange is a cool cafe/ grocery store/ coffee house/ pizzeria/ gelato bar. It's a bit overwhelming on your first visit, trying to figure out where to go for what, and it gets a bit crowded and hectic. I sort of just picked a line and lucked upon the right one.   I got the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, which you can order from the menu or pick up from their grab-and-go cold case, which is what I did. (Cuts down on wait time.)  Comes with 2 large iceberg lettuce cuffs, topped with their spicy chickpeas and avocado slices. These lettuce wraps are SO yummy and perfectly spicy.  Mine came with a fresh pineapple wedge; perfect for cleansing the palate. A nice, light, healthy, and filling option.    There was a large dessert case, but there was only 1 vegan option: an apple pie cookie.  I started to pass (I had my heart set on a cupcake), but an employee convinced me to try one.  Great suggestion! It was one of the most delicious cookies that I have ever tasted. It was perfectly soft and chewy. An amazing treat!  The items in the grab-n-go section are labeled with the ingredients.  The parking situation is pretty insane.  They do offer complimentary valet parking (which I did not want to do), and there is another spill-over lot about a block north of the building.  I chose the later and walked back to the cafe.  i didn't check out their groceries, pizzeria, or gelato bar, so I cannot comment on that. However, per their menu, most pizzas can be made vegan.   I would certainly return to see what other vegan desserts they have, and to get more of those yummilicious vegan apple pie cookies.

I came to this store to have some items laminated.  I waited up front for 10-15 minutes before anyone ever came to assist me.  One of the cashiers kept yelling over at me, telling me that someone was coming, so I continued to wait.  Finally, Ari (who is a manger) came and told me it'd be 1-2 hours before it'd be ready, which was not a problem.   However, when I returned, my laminated items had extra plastic sticking out @ 6-inches in each direction.  I asked them to cut off the extra plastic down to size (which has always been done without asking at other Office Max locations). I was then told that it would cost extra to cut the excess plastic.  (However, he laminated my corporate discount card and it wasn't surrounded by miles of plastic.)  So I'm thinking, well, did they charge me for all of that extra plastic? These items were art class drawings, on 11 x 18 paper, so we're not talking a life-sized Thor poster board (which I'd totally laminate).  So here I am, trying to handle 13 pieces of H.A.M., and being cut all over my hands and arms at every turn.  Peeved!  THEN I asked him to explain the charges and he couldn't. I could not get an explanation of what I was being charged for.  I am certain that there are consumer laws regulating exactly this sort of thing!  I will never spend another dime in this store again. Ever.

I had a particularly good experience while Xmas shopping here last week.  After being ignored in one of the departments, I moved to another department and received exceptional service from a saleswoman whose name has escaped me.  She spent several minutes helping me select the perfect gift.  She then escorted me to another department where I was assisted by yet another helpful and patient employee.  I've received this type of service at high-end stores, but never at a Dillards.  Again, great experience.

After hunting around for places which sold the newest addition to the So Delicious frozen dessert (aka vegan ice cream) selection, I found it here! They have all of the So Delicious Cashew Milk vegan ice cream flavors: Salted Caramel, Snickerdoodle, Dark Chocolate Truffle, and a Cappuccino flavor. There were no Salted Caramel in their freezer case and the worker pleasantly obliged my request to look in the back for more. She returned with my treasured Salted Caramel in tow!  Awesome employees. The parking lot is a little crazy at this location but it's not unbearable.

First, I must say that I'm a Hot Topic fan, in general. This particular store is pretty small in comparison to most, but it still manages to pack enough awesomeness into its crevices to keep you coming back. And what you can't find in store, you can order online.   If you're a fangirl (like myself) or fanboy who likes to have thingamajigs from your choice fandom, you're likely to find it at HT. This store has a nice selection of HP (Harry Potter), Dr. Who, Supernatural, Disney, Marvel, etc., goodies, ranging from t-shirts, jackets, & belts, to wallets & backpacks. HUGE selection of band & pop culture t-shirts. Their clothes (especially the women's jeans) run small, so keep that in mind. When I was a size 2, I needed a 7 in their jeans. (They have a sister store, Torrid, which offers plus-sizes.)   Goths will find no shortage of black everything. Cute punk outfits too. Fun socks, hats, & accessories. Head to the back of the store to search for clearance sale items.   This store is neat, and there are some really cool employees working here.   Sign up for their free HT+ membership/rewards program and get special discounts throughout the year, including a birthday discount.

This was my first time at a Harkins theatre. We didn't have them in my hometown, so when I moved here I remained loyal to another chain. But it was time to spread my wings!   The Harkins 101 is a huge complex.  It had a very clean auditorium and comfortable seats. The movie screen was large & perfect for the 3D movie I was seeing.  The temperature in the auditorium was also perfect; not too hot or too cold.  A Harkins employee came galavanting through the theatre during the movie, which was quite distracting. Not sure what that was about.   The restroom was clean but kind of small, and there were only 3 wash stations. For a theatre this size they should have more to accommodate large crowds.   I didn't visit the concession stand, but in passing I saw that they offer White Castles, which I don't eat, but it reminded me of home so it made me happy.    I had an enjoyable experience & I'll definitely return.

I can't really go into detail yet about what great deals I found (in case I have family trolling... I'll update after Xmas), but it was definitely worth our drive.  It wasn't my first time here though.  When my family visits, I bring them here. There's something for everyone: the women, men, teens, and "youngins."  Under Armour, Nike, and the Ralph Lauren store are amongst their favorites.  Great deals were available this weekend, and there was a nice selection in all of the stores that we visited.  We were able to check a few gifts off of our list.  It's an open-air mall, like many in and around the Phoenix area. I like that although there are a decent amount of stores, it's an easily walkable circumference.   It was decked out for the Christmas holiday, with a humongous Xmas tree and a large sleigh, in which you could sit for a free photo op. (SELFIE!)  They also had the normal Santa photo ops available for a fee.   Not a fan of their food court though. There were only a handful of options: Subway, Mexican, Asian, Italian (Pizza, pasta), BBQ, and Auntie Anne's.  I ended up taking my belly elsewhere for fulfillment.   Definitely worth the drive if you're looking for a bargain and/or Christmas presents.

We came here on Halloween night after arriving at the Chandler location only to learn that they were unexpectedly closed (there were supposed to be open).  Luckily, this Mesa location was only @ 5 miles away, and they were open until 11:30pm that night, so it worked out even better for us.   Admission was only $1 per person on Halloween evening for those in costume, which we all were.  We still had to pay regular price for the skate rental ($3.50), but at $4.50 per person, it was a great deal.  The skates were ok; the wheels felt a little "off" but I was able to work with them. Nice rink and the music selection was good; they played a mixture of current pop hits to throwback R&B and  pop 80s.    I'm not sure if it was because it was later in the evening or because it was Halloween, but there weren't a lot a kids, which is a major plus in my book.    The girls enjoyed the snack bar. They ordered pizza, pretzels, cotton candy, churros, and Icees.  Prices were decent and not too over-priced.   Also, there was a police officer on-duty and standing outside in the parking lot when we arrived.  I still feel new to PHX.  I don't know the areas and neighbors outside of where I live and work, so I don't know if the security was due to the 'hood, or just general practice.  Either way, I did feel secure knowing that someone was watching over the cars that late in the evening.   My biggest complaint here is that the employees' friends were on the rink doing some dangerous stunts (flips, handstands, etc while on their skates!), pretty much the whole night.  It posed a risk to other skaters, especially the younger kids, and it encouraged younger kids to mimic the behavior.  Not to mention, it's a major risk to whomever owns this venue.

I've been here quite a few times, and every time I go I try to remember if I am in Scottsdale or if I somehow teleported to Lazydale, because I get confused....  My main issue is with the front desk staff, who are all typically unprofessional (so busy talking to each other that when you approach it's apparent that you are bothering them) and honestly, a bit pretentious.  I once called and asked for a 2 hour massage and requested a masseuse who could do both deep tissue and swedish; I explained that I would like an hour of each.  The receptionist told me that they couldn't guarantee this. She said that it was up to the masseuse.  And the way she said it... Excuuuuuse me?  Are y'all paying me for my massage, or am I paying y'all? Let me know, because my bank account reflects the latter.   As for the massages, over the 2 years that I've been in AZ, I've only had alright-to-never again experiences.  Sometimes I just feel like it's a waste of money because I usually leave unsatisfied, and with muscles that were only slightly touched, even after specifically informing them of what I wanted.  Some of the masseuses talk too much.  I'm trying to relax and they want to chit-chat.  I'm too polite to say, "shut up," so I try give hints, a la one-word responses before going full ig-mode.   The last massage that I had here was on Father's Day.  I got 1 1/2 hours of swedish.  That day's masseuse seemed annoyed when I asked to use the restroom (which they typically ask me first) before beginning. She actually did a pretty good job on the massage, I just didn't like what I perceived to be an attitude.  At least she didn't run her trap during my session.   This location is within walking distance of where I live, but I'm fairly certain that I'm done giving them my business.

Someone told my DD about this place so we gave it a try.  She always gets shrimp fried rice. If you don't know anything about people from St. Louis, know this... We are fried rice snobs. So when she says she likes the fried rice from this place and that it's 2nd to home, that is a statement.    I have tried their Kung Pao Tofu. I loved the spice, but the tofu, although firm, was still too mushy for me. I'm just not a tofu fan, so unless it's cooked a certain way, it won't impress me.   What did impress me, however, was the customer service.  The employees (owner?) are always very friendly and kind.  Love the aurora that surrounds them!  I also like that they confirm that they cook with vegetable oil and no MSG.   We'll keep coming back whenever DD is in the mood for fried rice.  I may give one of the vegetable dishes a try next time.

We came here because the kids' high school uses them for the senior yearbook photos, and they (the school) will only accept photos from this business. You are under NO obligation to purchase anything from them, but I am pretty sure that they are aware that most parents are suckers for their kids, so... You end up doing just that.  That being said, Cameo Studios mailed out an advertisement for senior photos, which included some nice offers if you planned ahead. For example, if you booked your photoshoot in July, the photo session fee only cost $35 (instead of $50) and you got 8 free wallets + 1 free digital image.  However, if you booked in June, you got like 24 wallets, + an 8x10 + a couple of digital images all for free (with a $99 minimum package purchase)!  Well, the mailer came middle May, after the summer trip had already been booked and paid. I was a bit peeved about that. I certainly would have booked the flight a few days later to take advantage of those freebies if they had sent out that mailer a little earlier.  Bummer.   PHOTOSHOOT DAY: This was actually a 4-star experience. DD got to bring 3 changes of clothes.  There were 2 adult photographers taking indoor shots: 1 woman, 1 male. These 2 were great!  Personable, friendly, playful, helpful with the poses, etc.  The female even switched up the music and played DD's favorite artist and genre. I was quite impressed by that. (Heck, I can barely stand that music when she plays it in the house!) The only thing that I did not like was the teenager/kid who was helping with the photoshoot; he even acted as photographer on a few shots. If you're gonna have an amateur shooting pics, you need to slice your prices to 1/4 of what you're charging. But he was only photog for like 2, maybe 3 poses, before the pro took over.  After those two awesome photographers finished the indoor session, DD went outside with a 3rd photographer. He was no fun. I couldn't tell if he had an attitude or just lacked personality.  Either way, blah.    REVIEW DAY: This is the day that you return to look at all those pictures that were taken to decide for which 1, 2, or 3 poses you want to purchase packages.  When we arrived, both of the ladies in the front were busy reviewing photos with other customers.  We stood there for a few moments before one of the ladies acknowledged us, saying that someone would be with us shortly.    The woman who greeted us was the one who ended up helping us. I do like their review process. They show you similar photos and you start a process of elimination from there.  I assume, most people are able to narrow it down from 60 to 2 or 3 poses. Not us.  There were a LOT of great shots from which to choose, so the decision making process was a bit difficult. The employee seemed to be a bit annoyed. And it wasn't just me who thought this. I hadn't even said anything when both of my DDs mentioned her "attitude."  I ended up just purchasing the full resolution digital images of all of DD's poses, which was likely someone's weekly salary in there. But alas, no love was shown. No smile. Not even sure that I got a "thank you."     Maybe it's just me, but if you're spending over $500 on high school photos, there should be a little gratitude, or appreciation shown for your business.  I did not feel as if my business was wanted. What I did feel was a "take it or leave it" attitude, so I cannot give them 3-stars because this behavior is not OK. If I didn't really love so many of those photos of my child, I would've just walked out and not spent a dime.    Bottom line: They have good photographers, but the close-out people (ladies at the front) need to work on their bedside manner, and they are terribly over-priced. But, as I said earlier, some parents are suckers for their kids. I am one of those parents.

Safeway, Safeway, is the neighborhood...store. I don't do a lot of cooking, but sometimes I come here for a quick item or two.  They have an okay selection of vegan and veggie meat alternatives in the frozen section, as well as some vegan ice cream and frozen desserts.  The veggie hot dogs and veggie lunch meat are mixed in with the regular meats in those sections.   Prices here are generally cheaper than Fry's.  Get one of their free loyalty cards and save even more money.  Also, they accept virtual coupons; just show them on your phone.   There is a Starbucks and a US Bank inside this location.

I know some people avoid Walmart like the plague, but if you're going to go, this should be the one. This is definitely one of the cleanest Walmarts in the Valley.    The "fresh" produce is hit or miss. Sometimes I'll find the perfect fruit/veggie, other times they look battered & bruised.   There's a hot foods & prepared foods case, which I've never visited.   Large frozen foods section.  For veg*ns, they have mostly Morningstar (if you must) products, with like 1 or 2 Boca products, a few Gardein options, and Amy's products. (Savvy shoppers note: these products are sometimes cheaper at Whole Foods. Gasp!)  They're no Barnes & Noble, but they have a decent (for Wally World) book selection for YA & other readers as well.  There is a pharmacy in the middle of the store. It's kind of a cramped little area. Not a whole lot of waiting or wiggle room.   Also inside is a McDonald's, Wetzel's (sp?) Pretzels, bank, vision center, and beauty salon-type place (unsure if they provide hair services or just sell the products).   It's typically well-organized. Some things seem to being perpetually under-stocked, such as the gallons of water. Are they evaporating? (As hot as it gets, I wouldn't doubt this theory.)  The way the check-out lanes are manned is a bit baffling at times.   To avoid the crazy crowds, I like to visit this 24hr location either very late at night, or at the crack of dawn.   Large parking lot (so you can park in East Jesus to keep your vehicle ding-free from flying car doors & darting carts), half of which was repaved in July 2014.

Vegan donuts, say what?!  Ronald's has 2 1/2 cases full of vegan donuts (and there are regular donuts too...if you must).  Vegan options include Apple Fritters (a must try!), Bear Claws, chocolate and maple bars, large twists, jelly donuts, turnovers, chocolate vegan custard, simple glaze options, and more. All positively delicious.  Those 10 for $1 donut holes mustn't be forgotten either. Yum!  My non-veg*n travel companions were none the wiser.  Last year I spent @ $7 and some change for a dozen. This year, a dozen cost me $13 + change.  Not complaining; just a note.   The dozen come in a large pink box (think rectangular cake box size).  Usually, a dozen may stay fresh for a couple of days.  I came prepared this time. I was in Vegas 4th of July weekend. Picked up my dozen on Sunday, 06July, and stored the box in a jumbo sized Ziplock bag.  My donuts remained fresh for a week, unrefrigerated. Just stick in the microwave for a few seconds for that fresh out of the oven taste.   Cash only. Super friendly owner/employees. Arrive early for best selection.   Traveling from the Vegas Blvd strip, go west on Spring Mountain Blvd. You'll enter Chinatown. Keep an eye out for Ronald's Donuts on your right hand side.  Pull into parking lot. Eat. Repeat.

Horrible practices.  My community complex offered a complimentary carpet cleaning from this company.  I called to schedule a cleaning and was told that my only options are Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and the 2 timeframes are morning (8am-2pm) or afternoon (noon-6pm).  Seriously? When I complained about the inconvenience of the two days and timeframes offered, the unsympathetic lady on the other end of the phone offered to get a key from the community's office and let themselves in. What the...??!  So I chose a Wednesday afternoon, came home early, and waited... And waited.... No show. No call. No show.  So based on their lack of customer service and unprofessionalism, they deserve less than 0.

If you've never had Ethiopian food before and you don't have Ethiopian relatives to cook for you, then I recommend Cafe Lalibela for your introductory pleasure. If you're a seasoned pro to this cuisine, this is the best Ethiopian (restaurant) food you'll find in Phoenix.   As a vegan, I get the vegetarian combo, which comes with 4 hot dishes and a small salad. The hot dishes are misir wat (spicy lentils; my fav!), gomen (chopped collard greens), tikil gomen (cabbage & potatoes), & fosolia (string beans & carrots). The food is spiced to perfection; these are very authentic flavors. If you dine in, the food is served on top of injera bread. (If you despise soggy bread, be sure ask for the salad on a separate plate.) I'm not a huge fan of their regular injera; the taste is sour and a little "off" compared to the home-cooked injera I'm fed back home. But if you use your hands (as is the custom) to pick up the food with the bread, that taste is disguised. (They have forks, if you must.)  I've recently discovered that they have a gluten-free injera option which is actually really good; I was surprised! I prefer it over the regular injera.  The veg combo will last me 2 days when I'm not that hungry. When I'm being a hungry hippo, no leftovers for me. ;)  If you're dining with friends, I suggest sharing the large veg platter. These combo & platter dishes are great for first timers (try several dishes to figure which you like) & regulars, like me, who want it all.  No vegan desserts, though. Boo.   The owner is very nice, as are most of the workers. There is a worker who never smiles or seems to care. Don't take it personally; I think it's just her personality.

Green is good. Green is great. So scrumptious you may lick your plate. Seriously. I was a fan of Green long before I moved to PHX. It'd be my 1st stop once off the plane, & my last stop before getting back on the plane. Now that I live here, I practically live there.   This is some of the best veg*n comfort food on the planet. I've had @ 95% of the regular menu items. My favs are:  Big Wac: a vegan version of the Big Mac that could fool even a carnivore. Delicious & super filling. (Those with smaller appetites may want to cut it in 1/2 or share it.)   Wendy's Pickle: crispy fried "chicken" pieces w/ vegan mayo, a spicy sauce, & of course, pickles. An explosion of flavor for your taste buds.   Argentine Po'Boy: savory seitan steak with perfectly grilled & seasoned onions & peppers, plus mayo & spicy sauce. mmmmmm Mouth-watering!  Original G Spicy Po'Boy: mock chicken in a buffalo sauce w/ vegan mayo. I get mine sans tomatoes & extra spicy. Amazeballs!   (You can request light spicy sauce if you're spice sensitive.)   There's a BBQ "chicken" sandwich & a BBQ Bacon Burger. Both are equally so amazing that I have to eenie-meenie-miney-mo in order to choose. Their BBQ sauce is excellent!  All of the above come with a side. I suggest the thyme fries. So fresh & tasty!  When I need something on the lighter side, I get: the Jerk Salad w/ mock chicken instead of tofu. The jungle dressing makes me want to beat my chest & proclaim, "Me Jane!"    My 2nd favorite salad is the Ranchero salad, which features their yummy BBQ "wings." Go all out and add a side order of their buffalo "wings" for an epic party in your mouth.   The chili fries are very good...in the winter. I personally can't do chili in the PHX summers.   Then the chef comes up with these amazing specials, which they announce on their social media pages. Today, I had the San Diego "Fish" Tacos: crispy tofu (& I'm not a tofu fan) mock fish, in soft tortillas, with a special sauce. SO good!!   Don't you dare leave here without trying a Tsoynami (think dairy-free Blizzard). My favs are:  Soy Capitan (for a fruity sensation); Dough Boy (cookie dough, chocolate syrup & soft serve. Hello!); Cookies n' Cream (classic); & my own creation of pretzels, chocolate, & toffee nut syrup.   They'll sometimes have fresh baked goods too.   There's a small selection of vegan groceries.   They have a cold case with a large selection of beverages, including a very tasty Butterscotch Beer (non-alcoholic).   Nice decor. They have plenty of tables, but on a busy night, or during the lunch rush, it fills up quickly. I suggest calling in your order if you're in a hurry. There's a patio outside, but there's only one table at this time. (This may change once the weather exits Hades.)   Order at the counter, then take a number & commandeer a table.   The parking lot was recently repaved & remodeled, which has made for a better parking situation.   Green. Don't leave Phoenix without it!

I went for a corporate event and our area was very nice. Lush green fields for our kickball games and other games, a large volleyball area, decent amount of tables and grills for BBQing.  I saw tennis courts and large baseball fields as well. Huge park, well kept grounds. It was very busy, but not too crowded. Great place for families (lots of birthday parties were going on) or business events.  The only bad thing is that they don't have any recycling bins on the grounds. Tons of trash bins; 0 recycling. No bueno.

Came here for the NKOTB concert a couple of weeks ago. It's a large arena (it doesn't seem that big from the outside) and I loved the stage set up.  The stage was smack dab in the middle of the arena and the artists make full use of the stage, so that no matter where you're seated you have a great view.  Nelly (from my hometown), TLC, and NKOTB put on a great show here. The sound was great, lighting and effects went off seamlessly, and confetti topped off this throwback evening.  I do not understand why anyone would pay for parking, which I understand was @ $20+.  Free parking is available at the Westgate Entertainment center. The walk from the building entrance to my seat inside the area took longer than the walk from my free parking space to the entrance.   Bathrooms were clean. We did not visit the concession stands, but passing by, they seemed to be in par with other concerts venues in terms of offering and price.   I'm totally going back for MaDonna!

2 words: Fry Bread. There is something about fry bread that makes me feel like a kid. Then it makes me want to break out in Dr. Seuss rhymes.    Fry Bread, Fry Bread. You're so great. I want you piled high on my plate. Powdered sugar or cinnamon sweet. You're so darn yummy, you knock me off my feet.  When I first moved to PHX I was exploring my new neighborhood and happened upon this place. I saw their sign from the main road and almost got whiplash when I saw "Fry Bread."   It's a small little shop with souvenirs and a little kitchen in the back where the magic happens.    They have hand-written menus, which detail all of the ways you can get your fry bread, some of which include traditional Native American dishes (like a Navajo taco). They also incorporate some Mexican dishes.  I initially thought this was a Native American-run business (which I try to support as much as possible), but the ladies there speak Spanish, and an American runs the souvenir shop, so I'm not sure who owns it.  Anyway, I've never ordered anything other than the sweet fry bread, so I'm unable to comment on the food.  (I need to ask if their rice and/or beans are veg-friendly.)  So... About that fry bread.  It's always perfect.  Light and crispy, yet soft dough, with enough powdered sugar to give me a new complexion by the time I'm done. Exactly the way I like it.  With every bite I look up to the sky and thank the heavens for this good life and fry bread.  You always want to eat it while it's hot and fresh off the fryer.  No waiting until you get home or wherever you're going.  You'll only be doing yourself a disservice.   There are bench tables in the front and back of the shop, so have a seat and enjoy.   They close up pretty early (like @ 3p or 4p, or so; I'll need to verify hours on my next visit), so if you're coming up, make this your first stop.   I like this location because it's a straight shot up N Scottsdale Rd. Make a left onto  Cave Creek Rd, go down just a little and it'll be on your right.

They have added some vegetarian options to their menu, but it's still seriously lacking vegan options. The veggie burger is so bland... Play-doh has more flavor.   However, my carnivorous family loved their Jamaican Jerk wings & onion rings. Also, they had happy hour specials on some of their food items, so it was 1/2 off the wings & onion rings.   Nice atmosphere, lovely decor. They have live music some nights.   I wish they'd offer more vegan options.

As one of those females who hates shopping, I can say that if/when I have to shop, this is one of my go-to malls. It's really big and although it's an indoor mall, there are shops & restaurants outside and around it too.   Stores: They have stores for a range of budgets.  You've got the major stores likes Barneys, Neiman Marcus, Macy's, Nordstrom, & Dillards. You have luxury stores like Prada, Michael Kors, Gucci, etc. They have the tween/teen/ young adult stores like Abercrombie & Fitch, Forever 21, Wet Seal, Hollister, etc.   There is no Hot Topic, but they do have Zumiez and a couple of similar stores.  I love their MAC store and the associates there (hey Aaron!). There's a Sephora location here too.  When I went a couple of weeks ago, the Express store had some leather-looking, but vegan-friendly, jackets. Of course, I loved this.   Food: I'm only going to mention the ones that I know have vegan-friendly food options, since that's my thing.  Blue Burrito Grille: vegetarian options include guacamole or mushrooms in place of meat. They do NOT use animal products in their black beans or their rice. (I love their rice & beans!)  Pita Jungle: their employees are generally knowledgeable about ingredients (just know that their vegetarian burger is not vegan).   Johnny Rockets: vegan Boca burgers FTW! The regular hamburger bun is vegan-friendly, but the whole-wheat bun has honey. Their special sauce is not vegan; it contains eggs.  No dairy or eggs in the apple pie, BUT it contains palm oil, which I know is a big ethical factor for many vegans, so...FYI.   Yard House: 1 word: Gardein. It's outside of the main mall, across from the valet parking area.  Delicious vegan options!  Subway: veggie delight on Italian bread (the wheat bread contains honey). The vegan black bean patty has not yet made it pass the California Subway stores.    Parking: In a nutshell, it's insane. I've seen 2 almost-fights in the outside parking lot that faces Camelback, one of which was a Hummer-pushing Scottsdale mom with her frightened tot in tow. She. was. GANGSTA. lol There are parking garages and valet options as well.  Movies: There's a Harkins inside the mall and another theatre outside the mall, over by the Dillard's. It's a stand alone theatre which shows more independent movies.    Overall, nice mall in a nice area, with lots of options.

The last 2 times that I've overnighted in Vegas, I've stayed at the MGM. My most recent visit was for 3 nights over the 4th of July weekend; 03July-06July.    This hotel is always "poppin", and 4th of July weekend was insane.  If you're as big a fan as I am of people watching, then you're in luck.   I didn't have to bother with the check-in process, someone else in my group handled that, so I cannot speak on that aspect.  We'd driven in from the Phoenix area, arrived around 5pm, I dropped them off at the front door to check in, and by the time I'd parked they were calling me from our room, so that was pretty fast IMO.    Hotel...  lobby:  Huge, bright lobby with large TVs over the check-in desks.  The TVs are usually playing music videos (to my delight, as I prance-dance through the lobby).  The large boxing ring, which houses a large gold lion statute, is a popular attraction for photo ops.  If you want a photo of the Lion in Ring sans a million strangers in your backdrop, I suggest getting down to the lobby before 8am...while everyone else is still hungover and asleep.   Note: It was freezing in the hotel hallways!   Workout facility: on the 4th floor, if I recall correctly.  You'll need your room key to enter.  Nice, clean, simple little workout room.  Lots of treadmills (I didn't count them; maybe a dozen?), stair-stepper, and other equipment. It was well stocked with lots of clean towels, and it had 2 filtered water coolers.     Rooms: Follow the yellow brick road (overhead signs) to the guest rooms.  From the lobby, take a quick right, walk through a short hall (cupcakery to the left, convenience store to the right), until you reach the rotunda with the large fountain in the middle.  From here there are different pathways, above which you'll see where they lead.  Proceed accordingly.  (FYI If you are told to go to a room, for example, 401, do not assume it's on the 4th floor. Verify which floor, b/c there is a (for example) 401 on all the floors.)  We had a room on the 10th floor with 2 queen beds. The room was spacious, but not as large as the room we had here last year. Same comfy beds though! I'm not sure why the bathroom being at the door is such a focal point for some.  With as many people as I've seen stumbling through the lobby, barely making it to the elevator, I'd think the bathroom being at your instant disposal would be a good thing.  The bathrooms are large and clean.  I like that there is a wall separating the commode from the sink area.  The maid service was great.  She kept us stocked on extra towels. Tip: Tip the maids a little every day ($2 per day if it's just you or +1; $1 per person if there's a group of you), especially if you're staying multiple days.  You'll be rewarded!    The city lights can be bright at night, but they have blackout curtains in the rooms, so just close the curtains and nighty-night.  There is nothing that you can do about the noise in the halls though.  Dude; it's Vegas.  I don't watch TV when I'm in Vegas, so I don't know what the TV service is like.  However, there was an outlet center on TV stand, which included 2 USB ports; great for charging our iPhones.   I wish they would switch from glass drinking glasses to individually wrapped, disposable plastic cups.  Those glasses are unsanitary.   If you call guest services to request they bring you anything, call WAY before you need it. It took them almost 2 hours to bring us extra blankets one night.    Casino: I do not drink or gamble.  However, it was very smokey while walking through.  I wish they'd incorporate a no-smoking policy. But I know they're afraid to lose money.   Food courtyard: McDonald's and the pizza place (forgot the name) were open at 2:30am one night, and it was packed!  Other options during the day were Asian (think Panda Express, but the name was different), Mexican (burritos, tacos, etc), Southern USA (fried chicken, mac n cheese, etc).  Aside from steamed veggies at the Asian option, nothing else was vegan-friendly.  Pool: You'll need your MGM room key to enter, otherwise YOU SHALL NOT  PASS. Clean towels available, so no need to bring your own. Arrive early for a lounge chair (and some peace and quiet). Small humans (children) take over by midday.  Pool closes at 8pm, so no late night dips for you. There are different areas, and they're all huge.  You have to pay extra to chill in the lazy pool. :( I think there were at least 2 restaurants inside the pool area. I didn't visit them, so I have no comment. You can NOT bring your own water bottle into the pool area, so when (not if; when) you get thirsty, be prepared to spend $6 on a baby bottle of water.    Entertainment: I went to see Cirque du Soleil's KA performance, which was outstanding!  Fun, truly entertaining, eye-catching performance.  Absolutely loved it!  The auditorium is lovely as well, and it wasn't too cold inside. There's a concession stand, but I didn't visit it.   We got to view/rate a TV pilot, which was cool.

After a long, long wait, I finally got to sink my teeth into the vegan menu at Terrace Point Cafe.   I had the chicken n waffles ($20), with a side of breakfast potatoes ($4) & sausage ($4). The waffles were excellent. They were dusted lightly with powdered sugar & served with vegan butter. It comes with BBQ syrup, which is an acquired taste; it was ok, but I prefer maple syrup, which they'll provide upon request. The "chicken" was ok. It was was nicely fried & crunchy, but it could use a tad more flavor/seasoning in its crust/batter. The country potatoes were excellent & full of flavor. The sausage was ok; nothing special.  This was a lot of food. It lasted me 2 days.   It was a nice restaurant with a classy ambiance. The employees were friendly, attentive, and knowledgable re their vegan offerings.   As for the dress code, think business casual.   The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll return here to try more of their vegan options.

This is my favorite Yard House in the valley. Located at, but not inside, Fashion Square mall, next to Crate & Barrel. It's large and spacious. The staff is always pleasant. On my last visit, our waitress was extremely personable and borderline comedic. Loved her!  There were only 3 in my party, but we ordered a ton of food. It was Happy Hour, so we took advantage of the slashed prices.   My non-veg*n peeps ordered Chicken Nachos (a huge portion! 2-3 people could easily share), Chicken Strips, Blue Crab Cakes, and a Pineapple Pizza. They loved everything they ordered.   I got my usual:  Gardein Sliders (hold the cheese & sauces). You get 4 sliders and they come with fries.  Gardein Firecracker "Wings" Gardein Buffalo "Wings"  Everything was beautifully presented and delicious! I especially love how they give you the same portions at Happy Hour that you get during any other time.   The restaurant is always clean, restrooms included. TVs galore, for you sports enthusiasts. And I personally love their music selection. Lots of 80s rock = mucho booty-shaking-in-my-chair-whilst-stuffing-my-face. This will continue to be my go-to Yard House.

Sofritas, FTW!  One of my fav vegan meals from a fast chain. The sofritas are SO good.  I cannot get enough. The perfect blend of spices & flavor... Tofu never had it so good. Burrito, tacos, & bowl; brown rice, white rice... I love it all. Accompanied with their perfectly salted tortilla chips & the best guacamole in the galaxy, this is the business.   This location is insane during the weekday lunch crowd. It's a smaller location so the waiting line is always out the door. During the summer, this is no bueno. Do yourself a favor and order online or via their mobile app, so you can skip the line, pick up your food, & go. If you're paying with a credit card, you can pay online too. Even better!   My only real complaint is that this location sometimes overcooks its tortilla chips.   They share a parking lot with other restaurants and stores, so that lunchtime madness spills over into the lot. Good times.

Red Robin offers vegan & vegetarian (yes, there's a difference) burgers, so they automatically get cool points from me. They are also knowledgable about the ingredients in their foods, so be it allergies or preferences, it's easy to find out what you can and/or cannot eat here. For example, the seasoning for the steak fries is NOT vegan-friendly, so ask for regular salt or no salt, if you're vegan.  I like this location. Some of the managers will walk around and ask how your meal and service was; that's a great customer service gesture. Most of the waiters and waitresses are very friendly, attentive, & efficient. I've only run across a couple who could use an attitude adjustment or basic customer service training.   The food is always good. There are so many options and ways to customize your burger. Being vegan, my food orders are always a bit complicated (no this, extra that, etc.), but they always get it right when I dine in. They put cheese on my vegan to-go order once, but I called, informed the manager, and it was swiftly rectified.   On a side note, we came to this location for dinner on Super Bowl night and they allowed us to stay and watch the entire game. Even after we had finished eating they kept checking on us to see if we needed drink refills. I thought that was pretty awesome.   Numerous large TVs throughout the restaurant, so wherever you're seated you'll have a good clear view of at least 2 TV screens. (Unless you're sitting outside on the patio.) It's generally clean in both the dining area & the restroom.   Join their loyalty club and earn free burgers!

La Grande Orange is a cool cafe/ grocery store/ coffee house/ pizzeria/ gelato bar. It's a bit overwhelming on your first visit, trying to figure out where to go for what, and it gets a bit crowded and hectic. I sort of just picked a line and lucked upon the right one.  I got the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, which you can order from the menu or pick up from their grab-and-go cold case, which is what I did. (Cuts down on wait time.) Comes with 2 large iceberg lettuce cuffs, topped with their spicy chickpeas and avocado slices. These lettuce wraps are SO yummy and perfectly spicy. Mine came with a fresh pineapple wedge; perfect for cleansing the palate. A nice, light, healthy, and filling option.  There was a large dessert case, but there was only 1 vegan option: an apple pie cookie. I started to pass (I had my heart set on a cupcake), but an employee convinced me to try one. Great suggestion! It was one of the most delicious cookies that I have ever tasted. It was perfectly soft and chewy. An amazing treat! (I returned the very next day for more apple pie cookies!)  The items in the grab-n-go section are labeled with the ingredients, so you can see if the item is vegan or allergen-free without having to search for it on the overhead board.  The parking situation is pretty insane. They do offer complimentary valet parking (which I did not want to do), and there is another spill-over lot about a block north of the building for those who don't mind a short walk.

A cute outdoor mall with a great selection of eateries, shops, and entertainment. There is a main island that you can walk around, which has shops, restaurants, etc., then there are rows of stores on the outskirts of "the island." So if you're on the island looking for a store or restaurant & you don't see it on the main island, check the directory. You will likely want to drive to stores outside of the main island.  (Was that confusing?)  The island mostly hosts clothing stores for tween - 20s (think Hollister, Xi, & Hot Topic).  The AMC movie theatre used to be my main reason for coming, but there's also Yard House, which is one of my favorite restaurants in that area. They have a nice Barnes & Noble, and D&B is in that main part as well.   In the summers that have rows of misters lined up along the storefronts to keep (try to) you cool. That water center (a small area where small doses of water spout up from the ground) is popular amongst the tykes.  During the cooler months, near that same center, is a huge enclosed fire-pit. I love that thing!  The have another area with a stage and a large screen, which is usually playing a music video of some sort. They have events throughout the year, which are advertised in the Scottsdale mailers, so I assume they are advertised in N. Phoenix and other bordering areas as well.  Otherwise, if you're at the mall, they have a calendar if events posted. (I'm sure it's probably on their website as well.)  Ample parking. Well lit at night. Nice place for parents to let their teens hang out during the day. After a certain time (I think it's 6pm), minors must be accompanied by a parent or adult, which I think is awesome!

It's always clean and well organized when I shop here. But what I really want to talk about is how they've increased their vegan food selection.  There was an entire case dedicated to frozen vegan foods, including lots of Gardein products, some of which I haven't even been able to find at my Whole Foods Market. They were having a 2/$8 sale when I went, but their normal price is comparable to WFM prices.  They have a very nice fresh foods section as well. And there's a Starbucks inside this store for you caffeine fiends.   Great store for one-stop-shopping.

A vegan writes a review about a steakhouse....  My DD is not vegan, so I do end up coming here from time to time for her, but it's always via curbside takeout.  DD enjoys their grilled salmon, tilapia, Bloomin' Onion, and Alice Springs Chicken Quesadillas.  Occasionally, I'll order a house salad, no cheese, with their Tangy Tomato dressing, a baked potato and a side order of broccoli.  Vegans be sure to omit butter from the potato and the veggie sides.  They have a variety of green veggies from which to choose.   Everything was fine until the day a large fly was found buried in my DD's salad.  Poor baby lost her appetite for days after that. I reached out to the manager who apologized and took my contact information. (He was going to send me something.)  I decided that I wanted my money refunded instead, so I went up there. The manager obliged and still gave us gift cards.  This gesture earned them an extra star, but I just cannot give an A-OK after fly-gate.     For a limited time, they're offering No Worries Wednesdays and Sundays. You can get a 3-course meal starting at $12.99.

Once upon a time, I loved AMC. I'm a Stubs member and I was loyal to the brand. This was my go to theatre for a while until horrible customer service drove me away.  I filled out an online survey about our experience and when the manager called me, he was just as rude and condescending as his employee with whom we had an issue.    The theatre itself is OK. Some of the chairs in the auditoriums are worn and dirty.  They could use a good cleaning and re-upholstering. The temperature is typically comfortable.  I agree that the IMAX screen here is a joke. Don't waste your money.   I also once loved their soft pretzels, which they would make with water and salt, instead of butter, for me when I asked. Well, they have done away with the soft, fresh-baked tasting pretzels, and now serve some rubbery, hard-to-chew, generic version.  The Icees are good though.  For a while, I was going almost every day (pre-Yelp), but again, after the one very bad experience I'd only return for a free movie (pre-screening offers) or if you hog-tied me and dragged me in.

I love this area. It's forever popping. Its patrons range from the rowdy college students to the posh art enthusiast, and there are businesses which cater to this spectrum.   Hungry? There are lots of eateries from which you can choose: sushi, Mexican, Mediterranean, American, sit down, take-out, fancy-schmancy, casual, etc., and there is something for every budget. There's even an old school ice cream shop and a candy shop for the strike of the sweet tooth.   Got drank? (For you lushes...) Bars by the dozen, for your libation merriment.   Later, you can walk off those calories by strolling through the corridors of Old Town. And more than likely, those boots really weren't made for walking, so bring comfortable walking shoes because there is lots of territory to cover, as it spans both the east and west sides of Scottsdale Rd, from south of Indian School to Camelback.   Tourist? Tons of shops selling Native American jewelry, art, accessories, etc. Some shops are pricier than others, so if you have the time, shop around.  There are also lots of souvenir shops for your t-shirt, postcard, magnet, shot glass, etc., gift-giving desires. Unique souvenirs are also to be found. I found a cool knife with a wolf embedded into both the blade and the handle.   Are you a collector? There are shops that carry rare and hard to find collector's items (dolls, figurines, art/ paintings/ sculptures, etc.).  Shopping for fashion? There's everything from couture to hippie.   With salons, tattoo parlors, an angel store, western shops, art galleries, flag store, girly stores and manly stores, etc., and a church, you can satisfy the beauty and tame the beast.   Family-friendly during the day. Grown & sexy at night. An array of eclectic shops that you won't find at the mall. Hints of old Wild West are throughout. You can easily spend half of a day wondering around these parts (which is why I typically only hangout here during cooler months), so plan accordingly.  During the day, parking isn't too bad, but at night it can be trying. There are free public parking lots, just look for the signs. Public restrooms are plenty. Credit cards are widely accepted but there are bank ATMs around the main road (Scottsdale Rd) if cash is needed.   Whether you're a tourist or resident, young or old, cultured or heathen, there is something for you in Old Town Scottsdale.

I've been here no less than 10 times (a pertinent fact for this review). Prior to my last visit, this was always a 4-star place for me. They are very veg*n-friendly, and offer numerous veggie options, as well as Gardein options, which is a popular and yummy vegan protein manufacturer.  It was a great place for taking family and/or friends because there is something for everyone.   I suggest going during Happy Hour: M-F, 3pm-6pm; M-Thur, 10pm-close.  You get 1/2 off of certain appetizers (and it's not just a few; there's a nice list from which to choose) and discounts off of sliders and other items.  Otherwise, it's over-priced.   They have drink specials too, but I don't drink so I'm not familiar with those offerings.  My favorites are the Gardein Firecracker and Buffalo "wings" and the Gardein sliders (all available during HH). My order is a constant rotation of these three things; always.  When we visited this past Friday night, we ordered the Gardein Firecracker wings, Gardein Sliders, and there was a new appetizer that I decided to try: Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Potatoes.  The Crispy Brussels Sprouts were uneven in their preparation. 1/2 of the Brussels Sprouts were quite undercooked; the other 1/2 were delicious and melted in your mouth, but not crispy, as the name implies. The potatoes in this dish were indeed crispy (and flavorful).   My Gardein Firecracker wings came to my table and did not look like Firecracker wings at all.  They were sauceless pieces of Gardein with a side sauce.  I tasted the sauce and I didn't know what it was.  It took a while before our server returned.  He said he'd written down Jerk wings, which I've never ordered. Ever.  I advised him that I wanted Firecracker Gardein wings. His face went a little sour, but he took the plate back for a re-do.   My Gardein Sliders came out with cheese.  This was my fault. I hadn't been here in a few months and had forgotten that they come with cheese because it is NOT listed in the description on their menu. Our waiter took this plate back as well to be remade. They really should revise their menu to include a thorough description of their food items.    The Firecracker wings come back and some of them seem to be shaped a bit differently than the normal Gardein wings.  I bit into one and it was weird... I inspected it and found that it was real animal flesh.  After having already complained too much for my own liking, I flagged down the waiter and advised that I had been given real chicken instead of Gardein.  He stated that it was Gardein because of the special stick that was put in the dish, and that their Gardein is surprisingly chicken-like.  His assumption that I didn't know the difference, or that I was a Yard House noob angered me even more.   THEN he proceeded to bring over a different waiter, saying that the new guy would be taking over because he had a plane to catch at 10pm and he had to go.  1 - it was already almost 10:15pm (as my DD immediately pointed out).  2 - When we were leaving, @ 45 minutes later, he was still there.   My conclusion: So he's a habitual liar?  I didn't ask for a manager.   I didn't ask for the items to be removed from my $50 bill. I didn't stiff him on a tip (although it was substantially smaller than I would've normally given).  But I won't return to this location.  I'll proceed to the Fashion Square Mall or Glendale location when I need my Yard House fix.

I don't know that it's fair for me, as a vegan, to write a review for a burger joint. All I can eat is their fries with grilled onions, but they are always fresh! They're also the only place (that I know of) where I can get a drive-thru 7-Up soda. I only drink soda when I have a sick tummy, so it's nice and convenient to be able to swing by here when I need one.   My family isn't vegan. They love the burgers and animal fries (which are on the "secret" menu).    Open late. The drive-thru line gets long, but it goes pretty fast. The workers are always nice, friendly, & smiling. I love how they repeat your order a second time, for accuracy, once you get to the window.   If they ever decide to offer a vegan veggie burger, I would be SO elated!

This is one of few valley post offices that stay open late, which is extremely helpful during this Christmas season (and anytime, really).  Luckily, this one is super close to my job.    I've found that as long as you're not there during peak times (5pm-6pm), the lines go pretty fast.  I don't know what the difference is between the employees here and at some of the other post offices, but they are always nice and helpful here.  I keep having to go back for boxes and labels and the one guy was so nice that he even put the tubular box together for me.   They're also great with helping you get the best shipping bang for your buck.  They'll offer suggestions for packing and sending.  One employee was adamant to get all of my items in a smaller box so I'd pay less for shipping. And he succeeded! Awesome employees!

I normally wouldn't take the time to rate a Taco Bell, but I was so impressed with the kid in the drive-thru that I'm making an exception.  After hours upon hours of Xmas shopping until I literally dropped, I was tiRED, agitated and hungry. After shopping at Anthem Outlet mall, we ran by here for a quickie bite.  The kid (teenager) at the pick-up window had such a cheerful, friendly disposition that it turned my frown upside down!  Happy, smiling, friendly, jubilant... (cue REM's Shiny, Happy People Holding Hands...) So rare to see in many of the kids working in the service industry these days. Wish I'd gotten his name, because I'd certainly drop it.  Thanks joyous Taco Bell teen! Oh, and they got my order right too (black bean burrito, no cheese).

I went here with the intention of purchasing a Teddy brown eye-liner and a black eye-liner.  They lady who was helping me was nice, friendly, and helpful; I had no issues with her at all.  However, when it was time to check-out and pay for my purchase, I stood there, waiting...and waiting.  There was only one lady doing check-out transactions.   I assume that she was a manager or lead because other employees would go to her, asking questions.  Whoever she was, she never acknowledged me or the fact that I was standing there, for like, ever. The store was not busy (it was midday, mid-week), and there was only one person in front of me; the person checking out.    As I stood there, waiting, I happened to recall that I'd recently learned that MAC tests on animals.  I proceeded to walk out without making a purchase.   So thanks, MAC at Fashion Square Mall, for making me stand there forever. Otherwise, I would've made an unethical purchasing decision.

Negative. I've given this store several chances, but their customer service agents only seem to know how to tell you, "No," and what they can not do instead of offering to help you find a solution.  The first 2 times they turned me away, I went to Apple and my situation was rectified immediately.  After this last time, I called in to customer service, ready to go back to AT&T (goodness forbid!), and they fixed my issue promptly.  Really? So why put me through all of that rigmarole? The phone customer service agents need to be on the same page with the in-store customer service/ sales reps. It's ridiculous.

As a vegan and someone who never ate cheese even prior to becoming vegan, Italian food & pizza had always been off limits to me, therefore, it never interested me. So I'd been passing this place by like every single day for over a year and I pitching their neighborhood mailers every week. Then I saw them advertising vegan options and I decided to give them a try.  I am so glad that I did!  Appetizer:  I got the vegan chicken strips served "Super Hot Chipotle" style. They are baked, not fried, and they use the Beyond Meat brand. They were very tasty & perfectly spiced, but not spicy. I expected it to be very spicy, given the name, but it wasn't. At all. But to be fair, I do have a high spice level tolerance. The strips came with vegan ranch, celery, & an apple piece.   The vegan strips come in NINE different flavors, which I think is amazing! I will definitely go back to try more flavors.  It cost over $11 for this appetizer, which is almost the cost of a full pasta entree; a bit too high in my opinion, especially for the portion size. (So you're paying more than $1 per strip.)  They have a happy hour from 3p-6p and the appetizers are 1/2 off, which is about what the price should be anyway - 1/2 of what is now.  From now on, I'll only order appetizers if I'm there during HH.    Entree: I opted for the vegan Chicken Picatta pasta dish. The pasta was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The garlic, lemon, and capers offered a nice burst of flavor for my tastebuds, and the presence of the Beyond Meat Chicken was plentiful in this dish. It came with a slice of vegan garlic bread. Very filling and delicious. @ $14 for this dish, which is reasonable.   I wanted something "green" with my meal (but not a salad), so I ordered a side of Tender Broccoli Crowns. For $6.50, I got @ 6 pieces of organic broccoli. Nicely seasoned & crunchy crowns, but nothing special. I can make better at home, for less $... and I can't cook.    The waitress (who was actually the bartender b/c I sat in the bar area) was a bit aloof and she brought my check without first asking if I wanted anything else, like dessert. I didn't like that. I like dessert.   The restaurant is nicely decorated & clean. It has a really large and inviting patio area in the back and it extends around to the side of the building.  There were misters going, but I also saw heat lamps, which are nice for cool days.  The bar area had 2 TVs going, both showing sports. I do not drink, so I'm unable to speak on the alcohol situation, aside from saying that there is one.    I spoke with the head chef on duty and she advised me that they use separate utensils and even separate ovens for their vegan foods.   Tons of vegan pasta & pizza options (the website boasts that they have over 40 vegan options), lots of organic foods, 98% gluten free, & they support local businesses. I'd definitely recommend them for vegans (and regular people...not saying that vegans are irregular) for anything from family outings to business lunches or date night.    Eco-friendly to-go containers.  Located right off of Frank Lloyd Wright (can be seen from the street). If coming from N Scottsdale Rd & traveling east on FLW, it's the 1st entrance into the Promenade shopping center.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.   We came for happy hour (because as I've previously stated, things are over-priced, so at least the appetizers are brought down to what they should cost anyway), were promptly seated, and our drink orders were immediately taken.  I had the same waitress that I had the last time I came here, nearly a year ago (September 2014). However, being that management responded to my previous post in such a sincere manner, I assumed any previous issues would be addressed and I expected the best.  Well, I'm glad I didn't bet on that!  There was no change. She was still unengaged and seemingly annoyed that we took a while to order.  We did have a new guest, one who had never been to this restaurant before; one who hails from Italy and was cautious about this Americanized Italian food. (For good reason!)    On to the food: I ordered the vegan "chicken" wings in Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce. The wings were indeed very good, however, I learned later (while writing the review and looking at my receipt) that I'd been given RED THAI CURRY VEGAN WINGS instead. I had to go back and update my posted photo from that day.   RED THAI CURRY PASTA (made vegan): The vegan option comes with a brown rice penne pasta, vegan chicken, broccoli, mixed veggies, green onions, and almonds.  I omitted the almonds and any peas that may have come with the mixed veggies. This dish was ok. I don't know why I keep ending up with underwhelming flavored pasta dishes here. It's sad, really.  Oh, and this dish came with a LOT of what turned out to be eggplant (not mentioned in the menu description). I spent a considerable amount of time picking these out of my dish.   DD got the JAMBALAYA dish, which she said was better at the Sedona location. She said it wasn't as spicy at this location. She did omit the chilis, but they were also omitted when she ordered in Sedona, so...    My other DD ordered a CHEESE PIZZA without the sauce. (She doesn't like American pizza sauce.) She said that her pizza was ok.    FOCACCIA BREAD:  This bread is automatically vegan. It's yummy, but there is no vegan butter option to accompany it; they only have regular butter.  Luckily, the busboys (I'm sure that there's another name for this job, but it escapes me atm), were very attentive.  They kept the water topped, and one even brought some oil and vinegar for dipping the bread.  Side note: the Italian DD says that this isn't authentic focaccia bread.   1/2 way through our meals, the waitress brought our check and sat it in the middle of the table. There was no, "Would you like anything else?" or "Are you interested in dessert?" It was more of a "pay up and get out" feel.  When I informed her that we'd like dessert, she seemed flabbergasted.  *eye roll* See? Now you've wasted a tree because you have to re-print the receipt.  As the check sat on the table, my Italian DD mentioned that she never received her Coca-Cola soda, and asked me to check to make sure I wasn't charged for it. I looked and indeed, I was charged.  I did bring this up to the waitress when she returned with our desserts and she brought out the Coke (AFTER the main meal was done and over).   DESSERTS: Vegan Apple Cobbler w/ coconut ice cream. This was yummy. The cobbler was hot and sweet and the vegan ice cream was creamy and delicious. They even put some chocolate syrup on it.   Italian DD got the CHEESECAKE w/ CARAMEL SYRUP. She really like her dessert as well.    Lastly, Picazzo's has a REWARDS PROGRAM. It's mentioned on their receipts and on their website, but the waitress never asks if you're a part of the program. AND if you forget to give them your rewards account number, the company only allows you 3 times to add after your visit So, you'd think the employees would ask customers if they're a part of the rewards program prior to printing out the receipt, because GUESS WHAT? I AM a rewards member. I had points to redeem (and a Groupon too), so she had to re-print the receipt AGAIN. *sigh* So much for being eco-friendly.  Oh, and she said that a manager had to come over to scan the Groupon. That manager creepily came around my shoulder, scanned my phone and left. No, "hello," or "How was your meal?" He said nothing; just scanned from over my shoulder and disappeared again.  (I saw another manager speaking with other patrons, but we were never address.)    Their prices are too high to have bad service, messed up orders, and forgotten items.  I still left a tip, mainly because of the busboys, but it was substantially lower than what I'd normally leave.   Oh, and my Italian DD, who has only been in the U.S. for 2 weeks, asked, "Are you sure this is supposed to be Italian?"  I think that statement speaks for itself.

There is an inner Sumo-momma inside of me wanting to devour all things sweet. Luckily for my waistline, I'm vegan, therefore I'm limited. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I'm not limited enough. Sprinkles has a VEGAN cupcake!  Alas, a, meaning 1 vegan cupcake flavor, but I'll take it. It's a vegan red velvet, and it is marvelous! Being that I don't cook, it's hard for me to pinpoint key present ingredients, but I can tell you this: the cake is so very fresh, moist, melt-in-your-mouth & rich with flavor. The icing is so perfectly sweet (I like sweet thangs!) and creamy. It's like a vegan cream cheese. And they put an edible red "V" on the vegan red velvets, which I think is just too cute. (The red V has a cinnamon-y candy taste to it.)  My DD (non-vegan) loves their carrot cake.  They are definitely pricey little things, but they are so delicious that I don't mind going all cupcake-baller status every now and again. I keep begging them to add more vegan options. We shall see.  (Side note: the vegan red velvet isn't always listed or shown in the front cupcake case, but just ask the associate. They have always had some in the back when I've asked.)  If you get just one cupcake, they'll put it in a bag.  You may ravish that bag and lick the icing from its sides. Fair warning.  It's a small location and they do get busy. Like, line out the door and around the building busy.  Parking is a pain, any way you slice it, but you could walk here from the Fashion Square mall across the street. (If you plan on going there anyway.)  (Advice: do not refrigerate them. If you have extras, keep them room temperature and they should stay fresh for at least 2-3 days, if kept covered.)

I've been here twice now.  First to see Lucy on the Capri screen, and last night we saw The Expendables 3.  Lucy was shown in a very large auditorium, whereas last night's theatre was much smaller, undoubtedly as per the demand (or lack thereof).  Both auditoriums were clean, and had comfy, rocker seats. Awesome Dolby sound system. The temperature was ok. There was a tad bit of a chill, but I get cold easily, so I always bring a jacket.    On this last trip, I visited the concession stand for the first time.  They have a nice assortment of vegan-friendly snacks: popcorn (it's made with popcorn seed, salt, & canola oil; the yellow buttery flavor comes from soybean oil with beta carotene. Contains corn gluten, but not wheat gluten.), Red Vines, Sour Patch Straws, and hot or kosher dill pickles. They had french fries & churros, but I don't know if they use separate fryers for these items. (I'll update once I obtain an answer regarding this.) I opted for the popcorn (which was yummy as is; I didn't need to add salt) & a wild cherry Icee, which was perfect in consistency (not too thin or liquidly).  I'm new to the Harkins theatre experience (no Harkins in my hometown), so I'm trying to get used to the workers who march up & down each main aisle during the movie. It was particularly very distracting in the smaller auditorium last night.  Overall, nice theatre. Nice employees. I wish they had a loyalty program that allowed you to earn free movies & snacks.

I have a history with fairytales and with brownies.  Fairytale Brownies and myself? We go way back as well.  When I was still living in STL, the company for which I worked would give us these Fairytale Brownies on certain occasions and I fell instantly in love.  I would order tins of them for Christmas and gift them to my family (and myself). This was back around 2000, pre-vegan days.    Now that I'm vegan, I can no longer eat them, so I had forgotten all about them until my aunt came to visit me last month.  She typically doesn't eat sweets but she reminded me of her love for brownies. Then I remembered Fairytale Brownies and that they are based out of Phoenix.  I took her by their store, which is really close to the Tempe area (not too far from the AZ Mills mall), and she was like a kid in a candy store!  She got a bunch for the road and I picked up some to take back to my family.    They still had the popular flavors that I recall, like Toffee Crunch, Caramel, Cheesecake Brownie,  Raspberry Swirl, Walnut, Pecan, etc.  I also like that they offer the whole brownie square and the brownie halves, for portion control.  Based on the way my aunt smashed that brownie, I'm guessing that they are still as delicious today as they were 15 years ago.    Now if only they'd make a vegan's wish come true and whip up a magical vegan batch.

This was my first time ever going to a state fair, so my preconceived notions were limited to carnival-like food and games. I had no expectations beyond that.   I researched before going and discovered that they offer several money-saving ways to enjoy the fair; all details can be found on their website. We decided to go on a Saturday morning, when you get $2 entry if you arrive prior to noon, and there is free parking at the state Capitol. (I saw signs for parking charging up to $20. Although the fair only charged like $10.) There were comfy coaches waiting to take us from the Capitol to the fair, and there were fair workers on site at the Capitol parking lot to assist.   Once inside the fair, I was initially overwhelmed. It was a much bigger affair than what I had imagined. Food vendors by the tons, merchants galore, and some really cool rides.  We decided to ride first and eat later.   Rides. They had some pretty neat rides, for a fair. Mini-roller coasters, a huge slide (my fav!), bumper cars, a water log ride, the tower, and lots of spinning rides. Lots.  I had mucho fun on the all rides except the one with Poseidon in the front. I was no good after that ride (lots of hard spinning, and you have no control over yourself. If you're with a child, make sure they sit on the inside -to your right, so the force doesn't cause you to crush them).  There is an area with rides strictly for little ones, just like at an amusement park.  Aside from the rides, they had attractions such as bungee jumping. We watched from below as brave ladies took on that dare. Everyone survived. Good times. Oh, and avoid any rides that go through doors, like the zombie "house", etc. It's literally a room and it lasts all of 5 seconds. Don't waste your tickets.    FOOD. For those who don't know me, I must prelude the food section by saying that I am vegan. That being said, my food experience is limited. I had eaten before coming because I assumed there'd be nothing but junk food. I was right, for the most part, however, I did see someone selling a veggie burger. I pigged out on garlic fries (ask them to hold the Parmesan cheese if you're vegan or lactose intolerant), soft pretzels sans butter, Icees, shaved ice, candy apples, fried Oreos (Yes, Oreos are naturally vegan.), and Dole Whip. The stand which sold the Dole Whip also had Butter Beer! It's not vegan, but as a HP fan, it was pretty freggin cool to see!  I do not know about cross-contamination and all that, so if you're THAT kind of vegan, just steer clear. Also, there were racks and racks of animal flesh, mainly by the turkey leg stands. I'm THAT type of vegan, so I had to shuffle swiftly to keep from getting sick from the smell and sights.     Live Animals. Speaking of getting sick, near the kiddie rides, I smelled something and when I went to inspect I stumbled upon barns with lots and lots of farm animals, some of which were being sold. It was heartbreaking: the conditions, the looks of fear and sadness on the cows, chickens, and piglets, the latter of whom were all snuggled up together - shaking. And they labeled the pigs, "swine." That entire spectacle ruined my whole fair experience. I was later informed that this is what fairs are about. Really? I had NO idea. It was too much for me and my DD, who told me that she'd never go vegan, but after seeing that she has since changed her stance.     Games. After the depression partially subsided, we played more games to release some anger. Just like carnivals, the games are designed for you to lose, so take heed. I spent way too much money trying to win a big wolf and a unicorn. Nonetheless, we did have fun and that's what matters most.   Tickets.  All rides and games required tickets.  We started with 50 tickets, thinking that would be enough for the day. HAHA After being bamboozled at the first attraction, which gobbled 14 tickets from us for 14 seconds of "WTF was that?", followed by the next ride, which was actually really fun, we were out of tickets! Between the rides and the games, this continued all night. $325 later (in just tickets; not including the food), for just 2 of us; we could've gone to Disneyland.  They offer deals on the rides, food, and games on certain days. That is the best deal for anyone who's really into the games and rides.    Excluding the animal incident, we had a 4-star good time. The girls and I got henna tattoos, did some shopping at the Zion booth (where they sold Bob Marley everything), rode and ate until we were ready to pop and drop. The lines for food and rides were long, but went quickly. It's pricey, so be prepared to spend or come with the mindset of how much you're willing to spend and stick to it, no matter how much you want to claim that prize.  As an animal lover, it was a 0 star experience. If that barn had been in the front, I would've done an about-face and saved myself hundreds of dollars that day. Sadly, unless they nix the animal abuse, I cannot support this event in the future.

I came here with co-workers and was instantly hooked. I usually get the falafel pita (I add hummus; no tomatoes) with fries. You can get it as a combo, which comes with a drink, for less than $9. The falafel is always perfectly crisp & tasty. Their pita bread is always so very fresh; always. Like, seriously; they never have an off day. Their hummus is a yummy traditional flavor with a light olive oil.  That heavenly pita bread, spread with hummus, encompassing 3-4 crunchy falafel balls, with cool lettuce and fresh cut onions = triumphant flavor explosion in my mouth. I close my eyes and go, "ommmmm" with each bite. And the french fries? OMG. Made to order, so they're fresh, hot, & crispy every time, and coated with a delicious seasoning. Simply irresistible. No diet is safe!  If you go with friends, split a side order of fries. You'll get a huge heap for only $2.  My meat-eating friend is in love with their Caesar salad w/ grilled chicken. She says the chicken is amazing & seasoned to perfection.   There are a decent number of tables inside, some Mediterranean decor, and TVs. They have self-serve fountain drinks as well as bottled water. There are Sriracha bottles scattered about for your spicy-dosing pleasure. They also have an outside covered patio with several tables. I love the patio during non-summer months. We come during the lunch rush and the service is always pretty fast. When we're rushing or just being lazy, their convenient drive-thru saves the day.  The parking lot can get very busy though, and sometimes there's a tight squeeze between the parked cars & the drive-thru, so be cautious with your vehicle.   Z's Greek is an awesome lunch or dinner spot for veg*ns & omnivores. Consistently amazing food. Best falafel in the Valley, hands down.

I absolutely love this Whole Foods Market (WFM).  It's big, bright, and airy. Clean, organized, and typically well-stocked. Great customer service. Anytime I have a query re a product, they're always quick to respond, and very helpful. Even the cashiers are always friendly & smiling. Love that!  They open at 7am and close at 10pm. They have "everything, and the kitchen sink" in this store. One time I was in need of black flats early in the morning. Popped in here and bought some Toms (shoes).  They have a really cute selection of vegan-friendly clothes and accessories too. I also love how they support local vendors. I'll see them coming in to replenish their stock.  Speaking of vegan, their vegan food selection is vast! Everything from fresh, healthy, raw vegan foods, to yummy fried, soy/ tempeh/ seitan vegan comfort foods. I found vegan bacon bits, vegan honey mustard salad dressing, chipotle mayo, fried "shrimp" & "fish" for the 1st time right here. They have all of my favorite brands (Gardein, Follow Your Heart, Boca, Vegetarian Plus, Earth Balance, Beyond Meat, SoDelicious, etc).   Let's not neglect to give props to the in-house chefs for their superb vegan creations. My favs include fresh vegan cake donuts (various flavored icings), vegan cookies, vegan potato salad, vegan Sonoma "Chicken" Salad, buffalo "chicken" strips, Udon noodles, vegan cupcakes, vegan chocolates & truffles. I also love their fruit sorbets. The watermelon sorbet is an amazing summer treat. I also love their house-made spicy guacamole. Yum!  There is (usually) no shortage of vegan options at the hot bar or salad bars. I do suggest visiting these bars earlier in the day, as they look quite dreadful (dried out foods) by night.   They have a sushi bar, pizza station, & a coffee station too. I've tried none of these.   Check their store calendar for the different cooking & wine classes that they offer.   The cashiers & baggers always ask if you need ice for your groceries.   Great store.

I'd like to think that it was just me... I sat in a long line for an extra long time.  I wasn't feeling well so I needed a hot Calm Chamomile tea to help me feel human.  After waiting for what felt like an eternity, I finally reached the order window only to be told that they were out of the Calm.  Not their fault. So I asked what other teas (because I only order the Calm, and haven't the foggiest what else they offer) they have. The girl couldn't hear me... She had an attitude. "Which do you want??"  Oh no.  If you don't have anything nice to say... So I proceeded to move forward because this required a face to face transaction.  I finally reached the window and explained that I wasn't feeling well, so yelling into their intercom wasn't an option.  I, again, asked what was comparable to the Calm.  She recommended the Awake tea.  hmmmm Calm vs Awake seem like semi polar opposites, but ok.  (And of course, there was a "thing" with my 5 agave request; there always is.)  The Awake tea? No where near similar to the Calm.  Into the trash it went.  Won't be back to this location.

First of all, I'm a major Gardein fangirl, so when my omnivore family wanted to go to a pub that had an entire Gardein section in its menu I was all in.  They have a Gardein burger and sliders (omit the cheese and special sauce), which comes with fries. They also have Gardein "wings" in a variety of different flavors. The sliders & wings are on the Happy Hour menu, so from 3p-6p, M-F, they are nearly 1/2 off.  They have pasta options as well but I've never tried those. They've also added more veggie appetizers, like a cauliflower dish & a Brussels Sprouts & Potato dish. I don't know what sauces these are cooked with (haven't tried them) so make sure you inquire with the chef or manager (not the waiter) before ordering.  Food was fresh, yummy, and nicely presented. We had good table service. It was perfect for a pre-concert dinner. (Gila River Arena is only @ 100 feet away.)  If you're shopping or headed to a concert in this Westgate area, there aren't many options for vegans. Yard House is a solid choice, particularly when dining with omnivores.

Let me first say that I'm a pretty tough cookie. You may startle me, but scaring me just isn't gonna happen. That being said, I went into Fear Farm with a predisposed side-eye.   The set up was different. Fear-Con was also going on, so it gave it a sort of Cirque de Halloween atmosphere; very carnival-like.   There were 5 different haunted house attractions. We got there around 6pm on the Saturday night after Halloween, and it wasn't too crowded. We were the first ones in the general admission line for the house where you have to crawl. (Thank you to the reviewers who mentioned this! I'm OCD so I brought my gloves so I wouldn't have to touch the ground.) I actually didn't have to crawl though. Maybe because I'm short? Maybe because I'm a good squatter-walker? I don't know, but I made it through on 2 feet.    I was going to try to break down the 5 houses, but they're getting jumbled together in my head... There was a clown house. There was a creepy, Louisiana bayou house. A corn maze ( All of the houses included a corn maze though.) The Alien house. And the worst (for me): La Llorona. I don't like her, and I wasn't expecting her, so she freaked me out!  There were a lot of chain saws in my face and creepy whisperings in my ear. Oh, and the Jeepers Creepers bus was cool too!   I like that they let us go in by ourselves and they spaced the groups nicely so it was just us. (Except the Alien house. There was no one in the line and they still made us enter with a group. We entered and then fell back and waited for the others to move ahead.)  Lots of food vendors (fry bread, funnel cakes, curly fries, slushies, etc), and it was big and spread out.  Overall, I had a lot of fun, and felt that it was worth the money.  ($2 off coupons were available at 7-Eleven. I noticed that Groupon offered discounts in September of last year and this year. I'll be ready next year!)

I have had a good experience every time I've visited this store. During the PHX summers, I wear my hair in its natural curly state, so I come here for my natural hair care needs.    I love how all of the associates with whom I've dealt, no matter their race, have always been very helpful and knowledgeable with curly hair products.  I have received some good advice and recommendations.    This store has a nice, large selection of products for curly hair.  They have one of the largest selections of Carol's Daughters and DevaCurl products too.  Unfortunately, you cannot use the $3.50 off mailer coupon on these types of brands, which are considered "prestige" brands.    Nonetheless, nice store with nice employees. It's not near my home, but when I'm shopping in the Tempe area, I come here.

I love this place. It really is a beautiful and peaceful preserve.  If you're lucky enough to live nearby, it offers breathtaking drops for sunsets and moonrises. A photographer's dream.   There are many hiking trails from which to choose, from easy to difficult.  There are several information boards around the preserve, which give guidance and instruction for hiking and safety.  Even if you don't like to hike, or have someone with you who doesn't like or want to hike, still come. They have a cool and educational Nature Trail, which offers up an abundance of information about our desert, its past, and its inhabitants. It's a flat surface trail; no climbing required; no inclines.  It's also a great place for yoga or meditation. Every time someone comes to visit me, I bring them here.   It's easily accessible from Thompson Peak Pkwy.  Pet and bike-friendly. Watch out for bees in the summer months.  I've never used them, but they do have restroom facilities. Plenty of parking.  Special parking spaces available for those who car pool.

They were never fabulous, but they are now even worse.  So when I first moved to AZ, 2 years ago, I got a new car and decided to keep it clean with regular washes.  I happened upon a Groupon for this place: 3 Supreme washes for $25. Sounded like a great deal being that 1 Supreme wash carried a $25 price tag.    1st visit (circa March/April 2013). They won't let you ride in your car through the wash cycle (which makes absolutely no sense to me), so OCD Tiggy had to let someone drive her car through.  I have a sporty car, which, as all sporty cars should, has a manual transmission. I advised them of this.  Okay, they said.  As I am outside waiting and watching, what do my eyes behold? The jerking motions of my new car as someone who CLEARLY cannot drive a stick, is trying to operate my vehicle.  Oh. Heeeecky no. Are you serious?!  I voiced my grievances a manager who basically just told me to ask for him next time.  This was fine until that person disappeared (no longer working there). For the past year, every time I go, I get stares and whispers from the employees. And they know I speak Spanish so they have to be sneaky about it, which is really obvious and childish.  I can only assume that I am THAT person. You know, that customer whom all of the employees hate and talk about. mmmhmmm   On top of the personal degradation, they have now, somehow, managed to do an even crappier cleaning job than they used to.  I went last month and the dashboard was still dirty. They didn't even attempt to wipe the door or gear as they once did.  There was still dirt on the grill and the wipe down was pretty half-assed. Also, I used to get an air freshener in each vent. Now they put one, maybe two, on just one vent.   They have gone down...even further.  I am tired of it.  It's close to my house but it is not likely that I'll return.

Hi, my name is Tigra, and I'm an Apple.  I love Apple. I love this store. I love some of its staff. I make appointments online or via the Apple app on my phone. Sometimes they'll over book and you'll have to wait a while past your appointment time. I'm a pretty patient person, especially when I'm acknowledged, and this is usually this case. I've only had one guy who was rude, never acknowledged that I was waiting, and had the worse laissez-faire attitude. We do not take laissez-faire when it comes to our tech lifelines, mister! Luckily, he was only one amongst dozens.   They've saved my (ancient) MacBook Pro from what I know is inevitable. They have no problems swapping out a faulty iPhone, as soon as they do their obligatory water test. They even replaced a charger that had stopped working on my DD's phone, and we didn't even have Apple Care for that particular phone.   Large store with lots of test items and lots of accessories. Nice view of Scottsdale Rd outside the main window. A familiar view for all who've sat at the Genius bar awaiting the verdict on their products.  I may or may not have cried at that counter after finding out photos were lost during a botched software update attempt.   They get extremely busy during weekends and in the evenings. I suggest making an appointment for any and everything; even if it's just a question. If you don't make an appointment online they accept walk-ins too, you'll just have to wait longer for them to squeeze you in.  Well organized during the new product release. There was 1 line for those who pre-ordered and a separate line for those who did not pre-order.

We had been in PHX for @ a year and mija was craving a Southern home-cooked meal, so we tried Lo-Lo's.  1st visit, she ordered the Chicken & Waffles. She loved the chicken, but said the waffles were "alright." She fancies the catfish as well, but sometimes she gets "gypped" on the size/portion.  She since has become a fan of their chicken tenders, and she loves their Kool-Aid beverage options.  I like that they have a veggie platter, for which you may choose 4 sides.  If you're vegan, you can eat many of the sides (they do not use meat in any of their vegetables): greens, green beans, home fries, and regular fries are my go-to options.  The home fries are always amazing and tasty.  The greens and green beans are hit or miss.  Sometimes they are great, other times they taste like they've come from a can; I hate those times.  Their fried okra is bland; needs more southern love/flavor. The cornbread, mac n' cheese, etc., are vegetarian, but not vegan-friendly.  Not cheap. I spend no less than $40 for 2 people, every time.  Some of the waiters and waitresses are very sweet. Gospel music plays on Sundays; makes me feel like less of a heathen.  Large TVs can be seen from anywhere you sit, and it's always displaying a sport of some sort. The wait on the weekend can easily surpass 60 minutes, and they do not take reservations.   Their Scottsdale location is within a strip mall with Chipotle, Smash Burger, etc, so you'll sometimes have to fight for parking with some of the surrounding eateries' patrons, especially on a Sunday or weekend evening.  And it's hard to find if you don't know where you're going, so be on the lookout for one of the aforementioned establishments and you'll see LoLo's.  Or GPS works too.

I was in the mood for something ice creamy today, but vegan options are limited in the N Scottsdale area. I was over in this area, so I decided to give The Gelato Spot a try.  Admittedly, I'm a bit of a food snob, so I tend to ignore gelato in the U.S., thinking, "Oh no. I only eat gelato whilst in Italy." *posh British voice*  Well, shame on me!  Thanks to the Gelato Wars, they had a Vegan Chocolate gelato with smoked almonds and caramel. It was so creamy/dreamy and delicious!  I'm not a fan of nuts, but their presence in this flavor wasn't profound, so it didn't bother me.   They also had 6 fruity flavors, which were all vegan: mango, pineapple, banana, raspberry, strawberry, & lemon.  I sampled the pineapple, and it was also very smooth, creamy, and delicious. I plan to get that one next time.  It was very fresh too. No freezer burn 'round these parts!  I got a medium-sized cup and DD got a waffle cone. (I do not yet know if their cones are vegan-friendly. I'll update once I get confirmation on that.) My total was a $10 + change. I'll have to keep my eye open for the Groupon deals everyone's talking about.   My hope is that they keep the chocolate vegan gelato option, and/or expand their non-fruity vegan options.  Ample inside seating, including a cozy little area that's reminiscent of a living room. There are a handful of outside tables as well.  Located in the shopping area on the NE corner of Greenway & 40th, next door to Starbucks, & across the street from the QT/Sonic.   Yummy vegan gelato!

Tag renewal time, and like most persons of the procrastination persuasion, not only was I late in renewing mine, but I went late in the day AND towards the end of the month. *face palm*  It was a mad house in there! The large waiting area was standing room only. The line that you have to pass before you can enter the waiting room was out the door, but was moving pretty quickly.  To my surprise, the lady at the front desk was very pleasant and smiled as each person approached her.   When it was finally my turn to approach the front desk, I informed the worker that I needed to renew my registration. She inquired if I was paying for the renewal with a credit card. I advised her that yes, I was indeed paying with a credit card.  She pointed me in the direction of a self-serve kiosk, which had NO line, and said that I could handle everything there.  I walked over, entered the information as prompted (take your renewal card, which has the numbers you'll need to use the kiosk), swiped my card, and VOILA!  My new tags and registration card were dispensed from the glory box!  I was way too happy about this.  This saved me 1-2 hours of sure DMV misery!  Kisses to whomever bore fruit to the DMV kiosk!

I'll pass up 100 "Whatchamacallit" gas stations, with my gas needle 40 miles past E, to get to 1 QT; that's how much love my QT!  I have a long-term relationship with crushed ice (I eat it by the quarts), and QT has the best (IMO).  I purchase my quadruple cup loads, and upon my return I may refill them with more ice for free!  As long as they keep offering this, they'll maintain my loyalty.   Aside from my "thing" with the ice, my daughter loves their chicken caesar wraps. They sell Bob Marley's (it's a beverage), which we hadn't seen since we left STL, so this made us even happier. They've just opened a kitchen that sells smoothies, soft pretzels, pizza, etc.  They keep stepping up their game!    As with most gas stations, prices on their snacks and name-brand drinks (not talking fountain) are a tad bit inflated, but not outrageously so.  The workers are nice.   Also, this location offers gas a cheaper prices than anywhere in N Scottsdale.  Another reason to keep rollin pass the others.

I went in looking for a Cuban flag, but found so much more.   Big flags, little flags, flags on stickers, flags on lanyards, flags, flags, flags! They certainly live up to their name. Whether you're an American citizen with roots to represent, or living in the U.S. and needing a piece of home, chances are, they can help. Hundreds of countries were represented, however, I did notice that quite a few African countries were missing (I was also looking for Ethiopia).   Aside from flag swag, they also had sports shirts, jerseys, and caps representing various fútbol (sic), American football, baseball, etc. teams. We even saw our beloved STL Cardinals and STL Rams gear!   The employee working was very nice and helpful. I got my Cuban swag but did not ask about the Ethiopian flag. If you don't see what you're looking for, I suggest asking.

Every pair of black jeans that I've ever purchased have shrunk and faded into a dusty gray, except for my True Religion jeans. True! (lol) Years later and they've retained their shape and color.  Yes, they are expensive, but the quality is great, and I love the way they fit.  I went Christmas shopping and the guy (hot, with a British accent!) was very helpful with picking sizes and styles.  I forgot to ask for a gift receipt so I called and was advised that I could just bring back the original receipt and they'd print a gift receipt for me.  No need to lug any bags back into the store (as other stores have required).  Very easy and convenient. And the lady that assisted me when I returned was also helpful and friendly.  Nice store and employees.

When I heard that there was a place serving vegan Caribbean food, I was so excited to check it out. Caribbean Spice did not disappoint.  They have a menu board, with a "Vegan Corner," where they list the most popular vegan options, like Vegan Jerk Chicken and Vegan Curry Chicken. Other vegan options on the board included, Jerk Tofu, Veggie Curry, Curry Tofu, and Vegetable Roti.  I spoke with one of the owners and she went over their vegan menu with me: They have Tofu or soy chicken (Beyond Meat) available as a vegan protein; you choose which. Vegan curry comes in a tofu or veggie option. The veggie curry is made with chickpeas and curry potatoes. Beans & rice are made with coconut milk; no butter, animal milk or broth involved. Cabbage and plantains are vegan. She said that they have a veggie patty that is vegan too.  She added that they cook everything fresh, so even if you don't see something on the board, just ask for vegan.  They do not have any vegan desserts at this time.  Per owner, they don't use animal milk (they use coconut milk), but they do use eggs in their cakes.   I ordered the Vegan Jerk Chicken for $9.95, which comes with 2 sides: beans & rice, cabbage, or fried plantains. I  ordered the beans & rice and cabbage, but with a side of fried plantains (@ $3.50).  That jerk "chicken" was beyond amazing, and they gave me a huge heaping!  I spooned some of the jerk sauce onto my beans & rice and the result was heavenly; deliciously divine. The cabbage was nicely seasoned, but it had more of a crunchy consistency than to what I am accustomed. It was good, nonetheless. I left not one morsel on that plate. My plantains never came, but it was ok because I was too full to eat anything else anyway.  I simply asked for a refund, which I was given without hesitation.   My DD, who's non-veg, ordered the regular Jerk Chicken plate, and she loved it.   For drinks, they had ice tea, canned sodas (Coke products) and some bottled drinks, which appeared to be from fellow Caribbean nations.  They have a juice bar and smoothies as well.  Order and pay at the counter; they'll bring the food to your table.  I particularly liked that they brought me a straw with my ice water, so I didn't have to ask.  I went for lunch and arrived around 11:30am. There was only 1 other table at that time, and they were already eating, so my food didn't take long to arrive. Don't expect typical American friendly service. They're nice in their own way, just not the friendly-bob, perky, smiley faces that some people like and want.   Cozy little inside. One wall is hand-painted with pictures of South America and the Caribbean Sea. The owners are from Guyana, so their flag is proudly displayed. There was an air-suspended TV,  playing some reality show, which kept me entertained. I really like the outside, which has a wraparound porch with tables. I'd love to eat out there once the weather cools down. Shares a parking lot with neighboring businesses.  Their sign is visible from Baseline, so it was easy to find.  Delicious vegan Caribbean food at a reasonable price. I'll definitely go back; I want to try the curry too!

When they announced earlier this year via Twitter that they were introducing a Silk (dairy-free) option, my vegan world went wild!   There are only a handful (3, to be exact) of stand alone TCBY locations in the PHX metro area. I like this one because it's one of the larger locations, and they always offer 2 vegan (dairy-free) frozen "yogurt" options: Chocolate and Vanilla - both made with Silk almond milk.  Mix them together for some swirl action. Swirl! (Also, they have had the vegan/ dairy-free options since at least April of this year, so I'm not sure if the previous reviewer is writing an outdated review, or if she reviewed the wrong location, but lactose free IS available here.)  For about a month last spring, they offered a coconut-milk vanilla option, and mixed with the almond milk chocolate it tasted like an Almond Joy. Delicious! But sadly, the coconut milk option didn't last.   This location also has a TV.  We hung out and watched Men in Black III while eating our desserts, which was pretty darn cool.  It's a bit pricey. I was charged over $15 for my vegan cup of swirl, DD's little cup of vanilla with candy toppings, and 1 bottle of water.  They do have deals though, like $2 Waffle Cone Wednesdays.  (Be careful with the waffle cones though. This summer, my chocolate leaked all over my clothes from the bottom of the cone.  Apparently, you have to layer the bottom of the cone with one of their toppings so it'll soak up the ice cream. Weird, but just so you know!)

100% vegan bakery with cheap vegan sweeties? Oh yeah! Cupcakes, cookies & cookie bars, brownies, scones, pop tarts, cinnamon rolls, etc., served up in rotating flavors, which are normally posted daily (with the exception of Mondays) on their Facebook page.   My favorite flavors so far have been the Apple Pie cupcake (Is it an apple pie, or a cupcake? It's the lovechild of both!), the raspberry lemon (icing is to die for!), and... the... SALTED CARAMEL! One bite of that salted caramel had me losing my religion sideways.  Sinfully scrumptious!  The cupcakes are moist, sweet, yummy, and only $2+ change.  Order multiple cupcakes and they come in a nice box that keeps them in safe travels until you arrive at your destination. IF the cupcakes make it that long.  Being the cupcake fiend that I am, I rarely venture into other territories, but I did try a pecan bar once and it was very good.  They sell any left-overs for 1/2 price the next day, and yes, they are still fresh the following day.   Whole cakes are available for pre-order and the round cakes seem reasonably priced, but the sheet cakes are expense. Pricing available on their website.  Love the bakery. Love the employees (I wish I knew her name, but she has an awesome personality and she keeps me in stitches whenever I come.); they are always extremely helpful and accommodating. Excellent customer service every time.  The worst part about this place is that I don't live next door!

I normally park at my office and take a cab or walk to the light rail station, but I had a red-eye flight, and I was traveling w/ DD, so I went with plan B; airport parking. I've never used any sort of long term airport parking facilities, so I did my research before deciding to use Blue Sky.  Luckily, I also scored a coupon in my Valu-Pak mailer just in time for my travels.   GPS guided me to their lot without any complications.  Upon arrival at their security gate/entrance, I was promptly greeted by a uniformed employee, who kindly instructed me where to park and that I should wait at my car for the shuttle to come to me.  The shuttle came shortly after we parked but it was dropping off customers, so we had to wait @ 5 minutes or so for it to come back around to get us.  The driver was courteous and he provided us with a card showing our parking spot #, and he instructed us to call the number on the card for airport pickup when we return (very helpful info since we were returning late).  Upon our return, I called the phone number after I'd deplaned and the shuttle was there about 5 minutes after we arrived at the dedicated pick-up spot.  My car was found in good condition (no door dings found). Thanks to another Yelper, I was aware that I could use the Yelp discount in conjunction with the ValuPak coupon. I paid $29 for 4 days, which was a great deal.   I wouldn't hesitate to use them again for my long term parking needs.

After shopping in the Quarter, I wanted something light to eat so I decided to finally give TFK a try.  It was barely noon on a Saturday, but the inside was already packed and people were waiting to be seated.  The hostess said I could wait for inside seating or I could be seated immediately on their heated patio.  But it was cold outside. Heater or not, I moved away from a cold region so I would've have to endure the cold. * enter tummy-bursting wolf growl*... Ok, I'll take the patio.  It was a nice, large wrap around patio; partially enclosed with covering, but the outside air creeped in through the openings.  However, the overhead heaters were quite powerful and efficient, even for me.   Their menu items are labeled as vegan or vegetarian, and the symbols are different for each (thank you!).    ANDY'S TLT (vegan): Think BLT with tempeh taking bacon's place, and of course I omitted the tomatoes.  $10, but it ended up being worth it.  A nice sized sandwich, cut in half, served with plenty of what looked like butter lettuce, Vegenaise, tempeh bacon, and avocado, on toasted bread.  And let me tell you, they were not skimpy on the tempeh or the avocado. I was very pleased with the portions. It was delicious.  Everything was very fresh (no brown or day old avocado here!) and the tempeh was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I've tried and tried, and cannot get my home-cooked tempeh to turn out like that.  Also, it came with a yummy kale salad.   I only ate half of my meal.  Partially because I was almost full, but honestly? I wanted dessert!  I inquired about their vegan dessert options. I had read reviews which mentioned a seasonal vegan cobbler and I was really hoping to try that.  The waiter asked the chef and unfortunately, no vegan cobbler for me that day.  They offered a Chia Pudding or some other banana flavored dessert.  Not a big fan of the nana, so I inquired about their vegan ice cream.  The waiter offered sorbet. I wasn't impressed... Until he said "maple." Maple sorbet? Let's give it a go.  MAPLE SORBET (vegan): $2.50 per scoop. It was amazing! Creamy, delicious, maple-infused sorbet, which tasted like ice cream more than a sorbet.  The only thing that would've made it better if it had been served on top of a vegan cobbler.    Good food and service.  Nice restaurant and atmosphere.  I'd like to return to try more vegan food items, and... vegan cobbler?

If you think that there are no vegan options at Auntie Anne's, you, my dear, are wrong. Order the Original, Jalapeño, Garlic, and Raisin pretzels sans butter (which is added after they come out of the oven) and voila! Vegan-friel, lactose-free, calorie-cutting pretzels! And they'll be fresh too!  You can also order the Cinnamon Sugar, and Sweet Almond pretzels without butter, but the source of the sugar may be filtered via the bone char method. FYI.   Luckily, when I came here, there was already a batch of pretzel bites in the oven. I simply requested an order of those without butter.  I was advised that if I wanted something that wasn't already in the oven, it would only take @ 5-7 minutes for a new batch.   I also like the fact that they have Icees, so I can replace the calories that were omitted by the butter-less pretzels.  They have other drink options too, like lemonades and water, but who passes up an Icee??  They have a loyalty card, so ask for one b/c they usually won't offer it.  I was on my 6th pretzel so I was able to get one for free. Yay!

*sigh* There were so many things about this place that annoyed me to the very core.  1: it's located in a strip mall parking lot  2: the "mood" music playing for the crowd was a la Taylor Swift. Really?! Hot Topic has a better/creepier/ more fitting music selection.  3. The ticket booth chicks. Tickets were $26.99 plus tax. I had 3 $2 off coupons, and was charged over $87 for 3 tickets. Somebody can't add. (Same price, same 3 $2 off coupons used at Fear Farm and I was only charged $81 for 3 tickets. I want my darn $6 back.)  4. They made you go in with other people, instead of letting your group in by yourselves. Boo.  5. 0 scare factor. Zilch. Nada. I walked through there like it was Sesame Street. No jumps. No startles.   6. Why were 99% of the actors moonwalk/ sliding across the floor? Bye Felicia!   7. There were NOT 13 floors!   The good? A cool elevator (or whatever it was) ride in the very beginning, and the cool, wading through water effects.   Not worth the money. Will not revisit.

After days of junking it up w/ fried foods in Sin City, I needed something light and green in my life. I ordered a vegan Buffalo Chicken wrap. The wrap was large (I could only eat 1/2 of it) and it came with a simple green (think super greens) salad with a balsamic dressing. The wrap was mostly shredded lettuce, but it also had a fair share of the soy chicken, and the buffalo sauce (comes on the side) was yum! It was good, and it was just what I needed. The next time I'm in Vegas I will go back to try some of their other vegan food options.  Now, on to desserts. OMG First of all, there were not just one or two vegan options. There were MANY options for cakes and cookies. I finally settled on three (yes, 3):  1- Hot Fudge Sundae Cake: I don't know if I should say anything, because I don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone. The icings were reminiscent of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, it had a chocolate ganache (the hot fudge), sprinkles, vanilla cake, and a surprise filling inside, which made me want to do back flips. So rich, I could only take 1 bite.  2- Strawberry Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cake: a chocolate cake, chocolate icing, strawberry, a chocolate chip cookie piece on top, and the surprise chocolate chip cookie dough in the middle. SO delicious and very rich; again, I could only eat 1 bite. You could easily split this with 4 people, or have enough to last a few days.  3 - Lemon Raspberry Cream Cake: lemon infused cake and icing with raspberry. The perfect sweet & tart combination.  The cakes were $6.50 each, and very much worth every penny. This place should be a "must do" on every vegan's list, esp those with a sweet tooth.  They have their own little area with sitting just for their customers, and the employees were nice and very helpful.

My first visit here was in October of last year, for my DD's birthday, and we dined in.  It was early afternoon and the small restaurant was fairly empty, so we were attended to quickly.   I got the Vegetable Tempura appetizer, which included broccoli (which I love), and mushrooms (which I despise), along with other veggies. I gave the mushrooms to the birthday girl, who also got the Spring Rolls appetizer.  Both appetizers were good. The tempura was nice and light; not greasy or oily at all. And the portion was huge.    So, besides the appetizers, what's a vegan to eat at a sushi bar? Veggie rolls!  There's a Vegetarian Roll section on the Japanese menu. Mushi mushi! Arigato!  My vegan order:  AVOCADO ROLL:  stuffed with fresh avocado & rice, and wrapped in the naturally plant-based nori. (Does not have rice surrounding the outer parts of the roll.)  TOFU SKIN & AVOCADO ROLL:  1st of all, I didn't know that tofu had skin. Secondly, it's delicious! It's firm (not mushy) and the combination with avocado and the rice is very flavorful. The rice is on the outside of this roll. This is my favorite item here.   There were 8 pieces per roll.  They come with wasabi and ginger, which are both always fresh, and a yummy accompaniment to my veggie rolls.   (Vegans who are sensitive to cross-contamination may want voice your concerns and make special requests. I did not see them switch up preparation areas or utensils. My food has never tasted "fishy," but...just so you know.)   DD loves the Crunchy Shrimp Tempura Roll & the Shrimp Avocado Roll. She also gets 8 pieces per roll.  All of our rolls were 50% off the regular menu price. I think this discount varies, based on which rolls you get.  They have other veg*n options, like Teriyaki Tofu & a veggie Udon noodle dish, which I'd love to try one day.   We now frequent Iron Chef, but we mostly do carry-out orders. We still get the 50% off though. There is a dedicated carry-out parking space located in front of their door, which is extremely helpful during peak times, when the parking lot is jam-packed.  The employees are always very nice, and they package my veggie rolls separately from the meat rolls.  They also give you a free drink with your to-go order, which is pretty sweet.   There's a patio dining area outside its front doors.  The inside is dimly lit in the evenings; nice for a date night.

The bad thing about Nami is that everything is so amazingly delicious, deciding what to get is very difficult.  Nami is a 100% vegan baked goods/ sweets/ breakfast/brunch spot, which is owned by the same person who owns the Green New American Vegetarian restaurants. It's located next door to Green's PHX location.   BRUNCH: Served Sundays, 9a-2p. Arrive early or prepare to wait in a long, winding-out-the-door line. Try to be savvy by calling ahead (as I have), but you'll still have to wait in that line to pay for your order.   My favorite brunch items from the regular menu are...  -Biscuits & Gravy. Fresh biscuits smothered in chorizo gravy, topped w/ chopped green onions. It is so good! It comes with papas and tofu scramble (try the scramble with salsa or Sriracha sauce!), plus fresh and sweet pineapple wedges to cleanse the palate.   -Wing Ding Dang. Their famous spicy/buffalo "wings" (they really aren't that spicy, IMO) served with papas & scramble. I like it naked (aka as a plate instead of a burrito).  My carnivorous family loves this dish too.  If you wanna be fancy (*singing* I'm so fancy!), mix it up, or add it up, rather. Because I like the Biscuits & Gravy + the wings, I usually add a side order of wings to my B&G meal for only $5 more.    SPECIALS: They feature a different brunch special every Sunday, which is ingenious really; it keeps things fresh, and keeps the customers coming back. I'll be thinking, "Oh, I'm going to stay at home this weekend." Then, BAM! They'll post pancakes or the Flying Saucer as the special and all my plans have to be rearranged. The great thing about the specials (aside from them being, well...special) is that if you fall in love with one (and you shall!), it will likely be featured again sometime in the future.  My fav specials, thus far...  -anything with pancakes. Be it the Grand Slam, blueberry pancakes, etc., they are ALL delicious. I do wish they'd add pancakes to the full time menu.  - (I'm going to butcher the name) The Flying Saucer Full of Secrets? It's a Mexicana breakfast pizza w/ chorizo, black beans, hominy corn, guacamole, lettuce, enchilada sauce, papas, & scramble (I omit it, but cheese & sour cream too), atop a crispy fried tortilla. IT. IS. SO. DARN. AMAZING! It's huge too! Share it or save 1/2 for later (it warms up pretty good if you take off the guacamole first; no one wants hot guac)  -DaeDae's "Chicken" & Waffles. A vegan take on a southern classic, and they nail it!  -Bad @$$ Texas Summer Tacos (that's really the name!).  Tacos stuffed with fried avocados & refried pinto beans. Yum!  The only thing I'm not a fan of is the grits. Maybe I'm just a little too southern for these new fangled grits.  People who like them seem to love them. See for yourself.   BREAKFAST: It wasn't alway so, but they serve breakfast, Mon-Sat, from 7a-11a, so the Biscuits & Gravy, and the Wing Ding Dang are now available daily!   My favorite among the new breakfast items is the Country Breakfast Burrito. It's a big ole thang too!  Organic scramble, tempeh "bacon", papas, peppers, onions, & syrup (sans vegan cheese for moi) stuffed into la tortilla. Such a great and super filling breakfast!   OTHER: Aside from meals, there is also a plethora of baked goods from which you may choose, including various tantalizing donut flavors (these donuts are as big as your face!), cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pies, etc. I only drink water, but there is a humongous list of coffee/cappuccino, tea, juice, and vegan milk options. They have a (very) few vegan grocery items too.   Look out for the Nookie (ask about it!) & Sunday sundae specials! Live music sometimes.    TSOYNAMI: NOW let's talk about the Tsoynami! Vegan soft serve, originally in vanilla, but as of 07Aug14, they introduced the CHOCOLATE TSOYNAMI! AND you can SWIRL (chocolate & vanilla)!  My FAV Tsoynami creations -   From the regular menu  -Soy Capitan - vegan Captain Crunch & strawberries mixed in. Berry cool!  -Dough Boy - chocolate chip cookie dough & chocolate syrup mixed in. YUM!  -Cookies n' Cream - Newman's chocolate cookies + chocolate syrup. Classic!  From the "specials" rotation -Chocolate Monsoon - chocolate cake + chocolate syrup mixed in. HELLO!  -Orange Creamsicle - orange magic + icing (you heard me!) + whip cream = heavenly dreams that taste like childhood summers.   -Raspberry Beret - raspberry & cream cheese pastry puff & raspberry puree mixed in. AMAZING! (I may or may not have been singing Prince's song whilst indulging.)  MY CREATION - pretzels, toffee nut, chocolate syrup mixed into the soft serve. Create your own too!   If you don't want all that extra, you may eat the Tsoynami plain (think spiral soft serve) in a cup or cone. They can drizzle some of their naturally flavored syrups on it too, if you'd like. I recommend the caramel, toffee nut, and chocolate syrups.   A cup of Tsoynami is a LOT of ice cream. If you'd like to share it, tell the cashier and they'll split it up for you.   Nami for all!

This Green location is an expansion of their Tempe location. Sometimes when establishments do good and grow, one or some of their locations suffer. Not here. You get the same great food that you've come to expect from Green. And in an ingenious business strategy, they'll offer different specials at each one.    For the sake of not being completely redundant, I'll just sum up my favorite dishes.   Vegan comfort food: Big Wac (simply amazing; that is all)  Wendy Pickle (awesome!)  Original G Spicy Chicken & the Argentine po'boys (both equally yum!)   BBQ Chicken or the BBBQ Burger (BBQ is on point!)   All of the burgers & sandwiches come with a side of your choice of fruit, thyme fries, or a Tahini coleslaw. (99% of the time, I choose their fries because they're SO good!)  Feeling light? Jerk Salad w/ their succulent & perfectly seasoned mock chicken instead of tofu. The jungle dressing is delicious!   Ranchero Salad, which comes with BBQ "chicken" & their homemade ranch. I hated ranch when I was omni, but I like their vegan ranch.   Both of my fav aforementioned salads come with a spinach + dark medley salad mix (no icebergs here!), shredded carrots, & tortilla strips. You may opt for a 1/2 or full sized salad ($6 vs $9). I usually get the full and eat the 2nd 1/2 another day. Just remove the mock meat, heat, & replace on salad. Unless you remove the tortilla strips prior to refrigerating your leftovers, those will be annoyingly non-crunchy the next day.   This location has liquor options for all of my beer guzzling and mimosa-loving lushes. (Which is ALL of my friends.) I don't drink, so I am unable to assist in that area, except to say that they have drink specials sometimes.   Speaking of... This location implemented it's first happy hour this summer. It's not every day or every Friday, so I suggest stalking, er, following Green on Twitter, ig, & FB for the fastest updates & news.  Happy Hour specials have included delights such as Sloppy Jose's (sic) sliders, Buffalo Cauliflower bites, Roasted Brussels, & Garlic Potato tacos. All beyond amazing for my taste buds. (Happy hour prices extend to certain alcoholic drinks as well.) HH has only been at this location, so far.   Live music sometimes.   Nice and clean inside. Pay at the counter, take a number, & they'll bring your food to your table.  If you prefer fresh air, there are a handful of tables outside.    The restrooms are outside of the building. I am extremely OCD & shuttered at the thought. But when I was finally forced to utilize the facilities, let me tell you! That has to be the nice & cleanest little "outhouse" in the history of outhouses. I was very pleasantly surprised!   It shares a parking lot with its sister store, Nami. It's a small lot & it fills quickly during lunch & dinner times. If you're going for lunch, M-F, I suggest arriving no later than 11:30am, to beat the lunch crowd.   One of my favorite restaurants in the valley!

I love Indian cuisine, and being still fairly new to the valley, I'm trying to find the best places in town for Indian food.  I bought a Groupon for Madras Ananda Bhavan a few months ago and decided to go for dinner last night.  As we approached I saw a sign on their front door warning/ advising customers that if they use a Groupon gratuity will be automatically added to their bill.  I found that to be an odd and ostracizing thing to do, but at least they were upfront about it.  We arrived before 6pm and it was pretty quiet, with only a few tables present. Nice. I enjoy quiet dining.  The sign said to wait to be seated. We only had to wait a few seconds before we were seated and the menus were brought. I informed them right away that I'd be using a Groupon.  I advised the waiter that I was vegan and inquired about the menu items in which I was interested. He was knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly (awesome smiles!).  We ordered vegetable samosas ($3.50). They were huge and very good. Crunchy & golden on the outside; savory and spicy on the inside. Their tamarind sauce is stronger and more tart than to what I am accustomed, but it was ok.  I prefer the sweeter based tamarind sauces though.   I ordered the Gobi Manchurian ($8.99). It was absolutely AMAZING! The cauliflower was so perfectly crisp and that red sauce (not spicy) is so flavorful. Outstanding vegan dish!  I ordered plain puri/poori ($2.99 for 2 pieces), which is a light vegan bread.  Plain puri/poori is not on the menu (the menu offers stuffed puris), but just ask for it. It was very good.   My dinner mate ordered naan ($2), and the server advised me not to eat it because it contains dairy.  (Good looking out!) She thought her naan was a little too burnt for her liking.    Here's where things go badly...  My non-vegan dinner mate wanted Aloo Saag, which is not on the menu.  The waiter advised that she could order Saag Paneer ($10.99) and add aloo (potatoes), so that's what she did.  (Note to vegan's who are not familiar with Indian cuisine: saag = spinach, & paneer = cheese, so this is not a vegan dish.  If you'd like a spinach dish, inquire about them making a vegan version, like Aloo Saag with no dairy.) She really enjoyed her dish until.... she noticed a long piece of hair in her spoonful of saag.  Process of elimination: she has very long, naturally curly/wavy hair, so it was definitely not her own hair.  I was sitting across the table and never came near her food, but for s&g let's just add that I have extremely curly hair, so it most certainly was not my hair. I examined it closely to ensure that it wasn't an herb of some sort, but it was indeed a hair follicle.  Despite my OCD-ness screaming on the inside, I was very calm and maintained a smile as I called over the owner and pointed out the snafu. He apologized profusely, promptly took away the tainted food, and brought her a new dish with new naan.  Our dishes were served with a small helping of rice. What is up with the instant white rice?? You get @ 2 spoonfuls of this plain and dry rice. Where is the moist, fluffy, herb-infused, flavor-bursting basmati rice?  Very disappointing!  Pitchers of water were sitting on each table, even the unoccupied ones. Having a pitcher of water at your table is definitely a plus for me because I drink a lot of water.  However, with that pesky nat (it drove me crazy!) and any other germs flying around, I did not like that the water had just been sitting there for who knows how long (long enough that the ice had melted). And it's a waste of water when you get an OCD customer like myself, who will ask you to bring a fresh pitcher of water with ice in it.  Just bring out the pitcher once the customer arrives.   The bill came and there were 0 concessions for the hair situation. Yes, you brought out a new dish. That's expected. No, I did not appear to be angry, but I was livid and disgusted. There was HAIR in my baby's food! Department of Health &/or Public Safety, hello?! I just chose to behave in a civil and professional manner.  Wrong is wrong, and one should not have to rant and rave or throw a hissy fit to be accommodated in such circumstances.  I did not ask, but as a customer service gesture, that dish should've been removed from my bill.  Despite the excellent Gobi Manchurian and puri/ poori, or the friendly smiles, that was a deal-breaker, so sadly, I have no plans to return.

This is my favorite Primp & Blow location in the valley.  I have ethnic hair with no chemicals, and didn't think I'd find any who'd be able to handle it.  I came here about a month after I moved to the PHX area and discovered Vivian.  Vivian is a goddess with that blow dryer!  She is so good that she can get my course and extremely curly hair bone straight, shiny, and silky just using the blow dryer and a curl brush. Wow.  That takes skill!  Because this is the desert, we always add a hot tool for the finishing touch though.  I absolutely LOVE Vivian, and refuse to let anyone else touch my hair! :D  I love the scalp massage that you get with your luxurious shampoo service; it's very relaxing. I may have fallen asleep during one of them. And the chairs at the shampoo bowls are comfy; they have pop-up foot rests so you may elevate your feet, if you choose to do so.  The chairs at the styling stations were initially just ok.  They use to make my back hurt, but then I realized that they had pillows. I put one of those behind my back and VOILA! Perfect.  They have many hair products for sale. I really like the Moroccan Oil line that they carry. I haven't tried anything else.  They offer hair extensions and make-up applications, etc.  I haven't tried any of those services as of yet, so I cannot speak on them.  This location is bright and clean. I like the music selections that they play, and there are also TVs throughout for your entertainment.   They have iPads for guests to use while being serviced.  There is cool mint and/or fruit infused water to parch your fiery throat during the summer (and all year round), and they offer an alcoholic beverage (I believe a mimosa?) for you lushes, er patrons 21 yrs of age and older.   I also love that they have many Groupon deals throughout the year, and that you don't have to be a first time customer to take advantage of the deals.    The outside parking can be a zoo on busy days, but there is a free parking garage a few feet away, so no worries there.    Fashion Square Mall, and lots of eateries are also just a few feet away, so it's in a prime location.  Grab your friends, get glammed up at Primp and Blow, then go shopping, catch a movie, and grab a bite.

DD went back-to-school shopping in here. It's a large store with a lot of merchandise, but they do a pretty good job of keeping things spaced out and uncluttered.  There were many fashionable items for the low (think Forever 21).     If you're shopping here make sure you are certain about your purchase. Some of their sale items have a No Return policy; other's you have to return within a week or so.  And there is no cash back here.    When I was checking out, the employee asked if I shopped for myself too. Girl... This is definitely a teen-to-20-something store; don't let them fool you into believing anything else.   This store is located on the top floor, on the side of the mall that The Thirsty Lion is on (but up one floor).

I absolutely, positively love this place!  Even if I'm in Vegas for only a few hours, I stop here before leaving.   I like to try different things every time I visit, but I always include the Orange Chicken, no matter what. It's so full of flavor & spice (they will alter the spice level to your liking), and it's cooked to a perfect crisp. I like it with brown rice. Orange Chicken is a must!  General Tso Chicken is good, just not as excellent as the Orange Chicken.   Kung Pao Beef is ok. It didn't do anything for me in the knock-my-flavor-socks-off department.   Spicy Hon Hon Shrimp is good. It's supposed to be crunchy, but mine wasn't. I think it would better with a crunchy batter.   It is a 100% vegetarian establishment, but everything I have had was vegan, and other dishes can be made vegan, just ask. Particularly if you're getting fried rice, otherwise, you'll get eggs in your food. So again, be sure to let them know if you're vegan.   Nice clean restaurant. Super friendly and helpful staff. Accepts credit cards (there is a minimum order amount; I think @ $6).   Call ahead for carry-out orders. To-go orders come in nice reusable containers.   Can be tricky to find for first time visitors. It's in Chinatown.  If you're coming from The Strip (Las Vegas Blvd), turn west onto Spring Mountain Rd. Stay on Spring Mountain Rd and once you pass Decatur Blvd, you'll see the Pacific Asian Plaza on your left. It's located on the 2nd level of the strip mall, west of the supermarket.

It's a small location, but they have a healthy selection of products for natural and curly hair. They carry Miss Jessie's, Shea Moisture, Mizani, As I Am Coconut, and as of recently, Carol's Daughter as well. Currently, they only have CD's Black Vanilla products.  I was happy when, after learning of my hesitance to try the Black Vanilla, the employee advised me that I can try it and return it if I don't like it.  (Use less than 1/3 of the product for this to apply.)  Well, I tried it and did not like it.  I returned with my receipt and had a hassle-free return experience.  The woman who was working when I returned even offered to special order some of the other products in the CD line, which they didn't currently carry in-store.    I was happy with the customer service and the ease with which I was able to shop and return items.

First of all, gold star to whomever came up with the idea to put this froyo shop smack dab in the middle of the Vegas strip. (Well, it's not really the middle, per se.  It's closer to the New York New York hotel, and closest to the Monte Cristo hotel, but NY NY is a better landmark.)   We were walking the strip last month and stumbled across this store. I initially was gonna pass it up, thinking once you've had one, you've had 'em all.  I am so glad that I didn't stick with that mindset.  They were advertising their new Coconut Milk Swirl flavor; it's dairy-free and vegan. They offered a sampling and I was instantly hooked! This coconut froyo is SO good! I am not a fan of the coconut flavor, but it's so light and subtle that you can barely taste it; it's not over powering, at all.  (However, avoid if you have a nut allergy since it is made with real coconut milk.) I ordered the smallest size and immediately wished I had more.  It's ok.  I ended up coming back 3 days in a row, and each day the size I chose got gradually larger than the day before. I simply couldn't get enough of this delicious cool treat!  This location had a nice selection of toppings from which you could choose (toppings are extra, so don't go too crazy), and several vegan options for toppings as well.  For vegans, I suggest checking the nutrition page on Pinkberry's website to educate yourself on which toppings are and are not vegan-friendly.  9/10 the employees cannot answer our vegan 101 questions.   What I REALLY liked is that they weighed my cup to make sure I got the right amount (in ounces) of froyo. And on day 2, the girl actually put more in my cup after it weighed in on the lighter side. Yesssss! Gimme, gimme more. Gimme more. Gimme, gimme, gimme. *Britney Spears voice*  For others who also cannot get enough of this yumminess, they offer a take home size that comes in a large container.  If I didn't have to drive 4 hours back home I would've definitely gotten that to go container.   It is a bit pricey; not gonna lie.  But I think for the quality it's worth it.  Keeping with the Vegas, party all night theme, this location is open late: til 1am Sun-Thursday, and until 2am on Friday and Saturday night. Bloody genius!  (I actually went after midnight one night too. Hips don't lie!) However, after a recent snafu at a different Pinkberry location, I would suggest always calling before you go, especially if you're walking a country mile to get here or driving long distance.   VEGAN FYI - If you have nut allergies, there is a fruit-based vegan option as well.   As with most places on the strip, don't try to find parking (although there is a CVS next door, which has a teeny-tiny lot) at the store.  Park at a nearby hotel and walk the rest of the way.

I could've sworn this was supposed to be a horror show, not a comedy. I guess the joke is on me.  There are 3 separate "attractions" here: The Crypt, Asylum, and the maze. You can purchase them separately and choose which or all, or you can buy one ticket for all 3. I had purchased our tickets back in September, via Groupon, which included admission to all 3; it saved us 1/2 off.   The Crypt was the best of the three, by a LONG shot, but it doesn't say much. Nice props and an A for effort on the set up. Scare factor of 2, on a 1-10 scale.   The Asylum was alright and had a healthy amount of fake blood throughout. What it lacked was scare factor, and by lack, I mean none. Nada. It was quite the bore, but not the worse. 1 on a 1-10 scale.   The "haunted" maze was THE WORST. Seriously, the sorriest half-you-know-what attempt at a maze that I have ever been duped into. Picture an 8x10 room with plastic checkered drapes hung from the ceilings at random angles through which must push to escape said room. 10 seconds, maybe, and you're out. No props. No scares. Just those annoying plastic drapes. Everyone kept looking around, befuddled as they exited, wondering, "Is that it?!" "It can't be it. Maybe I took a wrong turn?" No buddy, you were just suckered like the rest of us. Shame on them for that HAM (hot @$$ mess). 0 on a 1-10 scale.   This thing is located in a shopping mall parking lot. THAT is your biggest clue. If you're taking small children, 5-10 or 11 years old, they may receive a fright or 2. Otherwise, keep looking. With a hard eye-roll, I declare, never again.

I love Ethiopian food, and after having this place bookmarked for months, I finally went to check it out.  Being that I'm still not familiar with the Phoenix area, I actually passed up this place coming from the I-51.  Once I doubled back, I saw it sitting in a little strip mall, across the street from the Fry's grocery store, on the SW corner of Thomas and 30th.  It was @ 30 minutes past noon and there was a "Closed" sign on the door.  Yelp said they open at noon on Sundays, so I pulled on the door. It was open.  A nice young lady said that they were open.  She apologized and said she simply forgot to turn the sign. (Hence, if you come during scheduled open hours and it says "Closed," double check before driving away.)   If you're not familiar with Ethiopian food, know that even though there are meat dishes, you can always find vegan options.  Appetizers:  VEGGIE SAMBUSSAS -  Think samosas (if you've had East Indian food), but these are filled with lentils instead of potatoes. Ours came out a tad over-cooked, but they were ok.  It was served with a spicy red sauce, which didn't compliment the sambussas.  I'd like to try them with a sweet & spicy type sauce (similar to tamarind); I might like them better that way.    Entree:  Their entree menu is divided into to options: Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian.  Everything under "Vegetarian Dishes" is vegan. I suggest (especially for first timers) the Veggie Combo, which is a sampling of all the veggie items.  I don't like mushrooms (which is one of the offerings), so our waitress was kind enough to let me get double Misir Wot instead.   MISIR (aka Misir Wot) - a slightly spicy red lentil dish. (This is my fav!)  Theirs was good and flavorful, but I'll ask for extra spicy next time.  TIKIL GOMEN - cabbage and potatoes. It's supposed to have carrots, but they were missing from my dish.  The cabbage was well prepared and this dish was very good.  FOSOLIAN - green beans, carrots and onions.  This dish is sometimes more tart than I'd prefer, but their tart levels were at a minimum. This dish is decent.  GOMEN - a collard greens dish, which sometimes can also have that tart factor (and I don't know what it is).  I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something was a little off with this dish here.  It was ok, but not the best gomen I've had.   ATER KIK - Now this is just a personal opinion, but this has to be the grossest thing to ever cross my lips.  It was yellow and pretty much resembled what would happen if I ate another bite. My insides are churning just thinking about it.  Don't know what it was because my DD enjoyed it, but not I. Ew.  Next.    Now this dish was supposed to come with 8 samplings, but I only got 7 (which included my double order of Misir Wot), so I don't know if the remaining item was DEFIN MISIR or MITTEN SHIRO. It was greenish in color, so maybe it was the pea dish (Mitten Shiro)?  Not sure, but I wasn't a fan of its taste.   INJERA BREAD - I'm singling out their injera because it's good and doesn't have that weird (tart) after-taste that the injera at some other restaurants have.     There are no vegan desserts.   Non-veggie in my party:  DD got the DORO WOT (chicken in a red berbere sauce), which came with 2 sides.  Her peeps on her paternal side serve this dish with a hard boiled egg, which she didn't get with her meal, and she immediately went on a Easter-like hunt for it.  Come to find out, you must ask for it if you want it.   Service was good, the waitress was delightfully friendly and helpful.  Prices were very reasonable.  The food was plenty; I couldn't even eat 1/2 of it.  I'd certainly return for more Misir Wot and Tikil Gomen.

IF YOU ARE VEGAN OR HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES, DINE W/ CAUTION!  We went @ 8pm on a Saturday evening.  It looked closed, but once we got closer we could see that they were open, and there was just an evening ambiance inside. (Very nice for a date night.) No one was at the host station when we walked in, however, we were greeted within seconds and shown to our table.  The tables were pre-set with plates. (I'm OCD & not a fan of this practice.)  Papadum (lentil crackers) arrived moments later, served w/ a tamarind sauce & green chutney. I inquired if the green chutney was vegan. The waiter had no clue what I was talking about, so I asked if it had any dairy in it, such as yogurt. He shook his head, no, and said it was made w/ mint.   We ordered: Samosas, Spinach Pakora, Gobi 65, Mysore Masala Dosa, Aloo Paratha, Plain Naan. I advised him (again) that I am vegan and inquired if any butter was put on the dosa or the paratha. He was very confused. He began to stumble his way through an explanation, saying that they may put butter on the dosa, but he wasn't sure. I reiterated that it mustn't have ANY animal products, and I nicely, yet firmly, directed him to find out, and to make sure any butter, yogurt, or dairy, was omitted from all of my dishes. He said ok, and jotted notes on his order pad.   Also, he noted that the Gobi 65 is $4.99 on the menu, but rings up as $6.99. I do appreciate being informed of this right away, but they should update their menus; put a sticker w/ the new price over the old price. (There were stickers, for lack of a better word, over other item edits on the menu, so this shouldn't be a difficult task.)  Gobi 65 - deep fried cauliflower covered in a red sauce (not spicy), arrived in less than 5 minutes. It was DELICIOUS & bursting with flavor!  Easily my favorite dish!   Samosas were HUGE!  Spinach Pakora - battered and deep fried spinach.  Generous portion. It was good. I would prefer more seasoning, but I like things heavily seasoned.   Aloo Paratha - whole wheat bread stuffed with spiced potatoes (not spicy). It was good. I think some Earth Balance would make it better.  Plain Naan - They have a "Butter Naan" on their menu, so I'd assume the plain naan has no butter, but I let the non-vegans have it; I didn't try it.  Mysore Masala Dosa - rice & lentil based crepe filled with potato masala & spicy chutney.  It came out as this enormous triangular-shaped crepe, bigger than my entire head! I honestly did not know what to do with this monstrosity of a beast.  Do I roll the whole thing? Do I cut the corners and nibble inwards?  I made a big mess of it, but it was delicious, and I could taste a small kick (might be a more noticeable spice level to those who are spice-sensitive).  Large enough to share.  2 more chutneys came with the dosa. 1 was an orangish color and the other was a light green color. I recall her (someone other than the waiter was bringing out the dishes) saying that the light green sauce was coconut based.  I inquired if any of the sauces contained any yogurt or dairy, and I backed that up with, "Are they vegan?"  She also gave a bewildered look, shook her head and shrugged her shoulders, saying, "I don't think so."  She didn't care to find out either.  I simply abandoned those sauces off to the side.  The restaurant was clean (Although my fork had caked-up food on it, which the female server did not attempt to replace once informed), the tables were nicely spaced in distance, and there was nice elegant meet rustic decor.  It was quiet and peaceful, but there were only a few other tables present and they were on the opposite side of the restaurant.    The waiter and the lady (different from the female server) who filled our glasses with water were very nice & attentive.  Both came over several times to inquire how we liked everything.   I called Karaikudi this morning because I had questions about the ingredients. The woman who answered asked the chef about the dosas.  She said, "There's a lady on the phone who's vegan, you know, vegetarian..."  HOLD UP! Vegan & vegetarian are NOT the same thing! She continued to ask about butter on the dosas, to which the chef said that he puts butter on the dosas. But I ate here last night and they made my dosas w/o butter.  She mentioned this to the chef and his response was that they can NOT be made without butter. (She also informed me that the green chutney has yogurt!)  You fed me non-vegan food; I am terribly vexed!    Yummy food, pretty good service, but the staff's lack of knowledge regarding the meaning of vegan, the ingredients in the dishes, & last night's staff's unwillingness to assure that my requests were honored, are unacceptable! What if I was allergic?!  I'd be more than happy to reevaluate & update once the owner: 1 - educates the entire staff on the meaning of vegan, what is/ isn't and can or cannot be made vegan on the menu, and 2 - mark the menus to indicate vegan & can be made vegan dishes.

I'm not into name brands, generally. I go for quality and things that I fancy as cute. But I'd recently learned that Michael Kors offered non-leather bags (as well as leather) made with PVC, a vegan-friendly material (also available in some BMW models, in case you wanted to know. ;)), so I decided to stop in while Xmas shopping.   I was promptly greeted by Melissa (if I recall correctly).  I advised what I was looking for and she showed me to my desired selections. She was professional and inquired about my budget and price range without sounding condescending.  I selected my purchases and she went to the back to pick out "fresh" ones for packing.  I was surprised to find that my PVC tote didn't come with a duster.  The other purchase did come with a duster though. I don't understand why one came with a duster bag and the other one didn't, but I didn't ask either.   The prices were very decent, and they also had up to 50% off of certain bags (not the PVC bags though).   The cashier (different from the saleslady) who rang me up started stripping my bags of their protective packaging without asking.  When I advised her that I wanted to keep it, she proceeded to take a bag from the trash. HELLO! I don't want that bag from the trash! What the?? That's the only thing which kept me from rating this a 5-star establishment.

I've been frequenting Bragg's for over a year now.  I love their vegan pancakes, especially the almond pancakes, which are made with almond milk (they do not contain actual almonds), which makes them sweeter. (Vegans should order them without the goat cheese topping.)  Those banana pancakes aren't half-stepping either! I'm also a big fan of their biscuits and gravy. Large southern-style biscuits, topped with a savory, corn-filled gravy. So good!  What I do not like are their sides. The hashbrowns are really stringy and I can't taste any potato in them. It's weird. But my DD loves them, so maybe it's just me. I'm not a fan of the eggplant bacon, which lacks flavor. Maybe if they fried them to a crisp and added some seasoning?  Rosemary potatoes are decent, but bland as well. On my last visit, I tried the Jackfruit Barbacoa. It was ok, but the tabasco sauce (or whatever hot sauce they dosed it in) drowned out any real flavor, so all I tasted was heat. I love spicy thangs, but only when they're equally flavorful.  The potato salad is probably my favorite side item, but it contains peas, which I do not like, so... But hey, there's always fresh fruit. Can't go wrong with that!  This IS a pie factory, so can we talk about the desserts?!  YASSSSS!  Where to start? Cookies, pies, donuts, whoopie-pies, brownies, cakes, etc.  I've loved every thing I've ever tried in that dessert case!  They had vegan lemon bars the last time I went, and OMG - it was amazing! I need to ask about ordering a batch of those just on GP.   You can order affordable whole cakes and pies for the holidays, or just because!  It's a funky/hip little veg*n diner.  They do serve animal-eggs and cheeses, and the menu isn't marked vegan vs vegetarian, so if you have questions just ask. I'm 99% positive that I was told that ALL of the desserts are vegan though.    They had really cool activities like karaoke nights, game nights, and other events this past summer, and food specials were available during those times.  Prices are already reasonable, but you can also find Groupon deals quite frequently. They have a private parking lot across the street, so there's no stress in trying to find a parking spot. Open late.

Just took my first ever Zumba class this morning. I loved it! The instructor, Laja, was a fun-filled energy ball of sass & sabor. Great choreography, awesome music selection, & positive vibes. She was very friendly, welcoming, & encouraging. As an outsider/newbie, I felt very comfortable.   The Zumba class lasted a full hour. It started off with warm-up type dance moves then progressed into high energy, faster paced, bon-bon shaking power moves. Towards the end of the hour (the last 5 or 10 minutes), she slowed it down and incorporated some muscle stretches into the cool down period.   I was a hot, sweaty mess at the end of the hour, but I truly had a blast and will definitely take one of her classes again.   There are several ceiling fans & 2 large industrial fans to help keep the dancers cool. It's a small studio, but there were only a total of 5 of us today. I don't know how it'd work with a larger group.   There's a filtered water cooler for use if you forget to bring a water bottle.  They had a few organic goods for sale, like natural deodorant.   They allow new students to take the first class free of charge.  Specials on membership prices are available via their website, and I saw a Yelp deal as well.   Located in a strip mall, next to the Safeway off of Greenway & 64th, so plenty of parking.

Grabbagreen is a small eatery specializing in fresh, natural (no preservatives) foods, and they are 100% gluten free.  They have tons of smoothie and juice options if you want a liquid meal. For others, there are salads (greens) and "bowls", which they call "grains". I opted for the latter.   I made my own. For the grain I mixed quinoa and brown rice. My protein choice was black beans. You get to pick 5 nutrients and I got spinach, corn, red onion, edamame, and avocado. I skipped the cheese option (of course). Cilantro was my herb of choice, and I got the Spicy Almond dressing.  My meal was a carry-out order and it came in a little brown box, but the box was heavy; you could tell that they packed it in really good.   It was very delicious and everything tasted quite fresh.  The Spicy Almond truly had some kick, which was awesome. It has a flavor that is slightly reminiscent of a yellow curry.  I also added some chili mango hot sauce to it after seeing the bottle. Yum yum!  I was very full after eating this, so I felt that it was worth the $10.  I think next time I'll only eat 1/2 and save the rest for another day.    There are lots of options for vegans here, and many of their dressings for the greens and grains are vegan (look for the "V" by the name).  The acai cups looked yummy too. I'll have to stop by and have one for breakfast one day.  The only thing they're missing is vegan dessert. (They had some non-vegan cookies.)  Clean establishment. Friendly workers.  Located in the strip mall on the SE corner of FLW and the 101, before you cross under the hwy for eastbound traffic; after the hwy for wb traffic (in the parking lot with Best Buy). Lots of parking spaces.  There were 2 designated parking spaces for call ahead, pick-up orders.

Yummy flavored Italian Ice, which I never thought I'd see outside of the east coast.  Lucky ducky, they've expanded and blessed us with their presence in AZ, which unlike the east coast, stays open year-round!  The Cotton Candy is my favorite ice flavor.  The workers are typically young adults and teenagers, but I've never had any issues with bad attitudes or anything like that.  Get their app and you'll get a free Ice on your 8th visit. Just don't forget to scan the barcode, which is the equivalent of "punching" your "card." Also, sign up for their emails and get a free small Ice on your birthday.    If you buy an Ice and can't eat it all, cover it well and freeze it. When you're ready to eat it again, put it in the microwave for a few seconds, which slightly unthaws it so that it's edible.   Close parking spaces can fill up quickly at this location, since it shares with several stores in the strip mall.  You can always park over by the Subway and Big Lots and walk over.

Short version? It sucked. But WHY did it suck? Ok, let's start from the beginning. I called around 8pm to place my order. I ordered DD's simple sandwich first, then went on to mine, which is always complicated. I requested the Veggie with no cheese, no mayo, no tomatoes, and no cucumbers. Then I stated that in place of the things I was omitting, I'd like extra avocado spread. He said, "ok." Then I proceeded to add my freebies like sprouts, oil & vinegar, peppers, etc. It had been a while since I'd ordered JJ's for myself, so I couldn't recall if they gave you a pickle spear with your sandwich (I'm 80% certain the JJ's back home did), so I asked. He said, "Yeah, you can get them on the side." Ok, sweet.   @ 8:55pm. JJ's arrives. I look at the receipt and I was charged for the extra avocado spread and for 2 orders of pickles. Why did he not tell me that he was charging me for these things? Granted, this is only a couple of bucks, but it's the principle. I called and spoke with the manager, Nick. I inquired why, if I omitted cheese (which costs $0.75 to add), would I be charged $0.75 for the extra avocado spread? It clearly evens itself out. He basically said that his POS (the cash register) wasn't sophisticated enough to handle the swap. Really? THAT's your excuse?! I asked for the GM, whom Nick stated had just quit last week, so.... At this point, I'm just done. I didn't even get to the darn pickles. In that moment I decided that I simply won't patronize this JJ's again. (Did I mention that the sandwiches were freezing cold when they arrived? Any other JJ's always toasts my bread.)  There is a JJ's down the street, by the Quarter; I'll give them my business instead.

I love Ethiopian cuisine, and I especially love that they have so many vegan dishes. That being said, it pains me to have to rate this establishment as sub-par. It may have just been an off day.   I arrived around 11:30am. We were the only ones there.  I ordered a vegan plate. I was advised I could choose 4 sides, so I chose Misir Wat, Tikel Gomen, Gomen, & Shiro (sp?). My lunch companion is a meat eater; she requested Doro Wat, but was advised they didn't have that today. So, make that 2 vegan plates. No problem.   40 min later our food comes out. I'm very patient, so I wasn't too bothered or upset by this. Then I tried to pay. "No cash?" she asked, as I stand with my credit card in hand. I simply replied, "No." She said that she didn't have the password. I didn't even ask why a password was needed to swipe my card. She called somebody, then informed me that he was on his way. Who? The password?? So we sit...   A man arrived @ 15-20 min later, apologizing profusely. As he processed the charge ($20; $10 per plate), he chatted me up. He asked if it was our first time, and inquired how we heard about them. I answered accordingly. He then requested I rate them highly. Enter my side eye. I was ok with the hour it took to get and subsequently pay for our meal. But when you attempt to solicit unwarranted praise for subpar service, you've now picked my pickle, mister. You didn't even offer me a discount for the inconvenience.   The food: misir wat & gomen were good, but I've had much better misir wat.  Tikel gomen was undercooked. My cabbage was almost crunchy Shiro (sp?) was ok.   The portions of veggies were very small. And I eat small portions. There was a ton of injera bread though. Pity, because it went to waste.   Again, maybe it was an off day, but I don't plan on returning to find out.

Lovely store with a nice selection of Prada goods.  I was Christmas shopping and the sales lady was very helpful with her suggestions.  However, I was asked what I did for a living, and she began to pry even further into my occupation.  I have never been asked this question while shopping at a high-end store, so I was definitely taken aback.  Is this normal?  It can't be. Who does that?  In slight paranoia, I began thinking that since I didn't fit the visual profile of a corporate exec, rapper, stripper, or trophy wife, she couldn't figure out why I was (or could be) shopping there, and her curiosity got the best of her.  In Julia Roberts' Pretty Woman words, "Big mistake."  I went elsewhere.

I was introduced to Title Boxing Club via a Groupon deal, which gave me 2 weeks of unlimited classes at this location.   Amanda, at the front desk, was very nice and helpful.  I got free hand-wraps with the Groupon, and Amanda taught me how to wrap my hands.  They have boxing gloves there, which you can borrow for your workouts, or you can bring your own.  They also have boxing gloves available for sale, in a variety of colors (pink!). They sell various other items too.  I came for the kickboxing; I was looking forward to getting my Bruce Lee/Gina Carano on.  However, I was soon just as equally excited for the regular boxing segments.  Something about ending a hectic Monday by fast-loading some rapid body punches to your boss, I mean, punching bag. It was truly a stress-reducer/reliever.  They have their class schedule posted on their website, so you can see the times that are available for kickboxing vs just boxing.   The instructor-led workouts are an hour long, and they break them up so that you have several 1-minute breaks, which is awesome for me. Water break!  If you don't want to take the break, the instructor gives you an activity to keep you busy during that time. They start you off with warm-ups, then there are eight 3-minute rounds, followed by a cool down. Those rounds are NO joke! I was sweating like pig in the Mississippi sun after each and every workout.  I never knew how much boxing could take out of you! I have a whole new respect for that profession.   I loved the regular instructors that I had. I had my normal instructor, I think his name was Jack, and then there was a lady on the weekends, and I really enjoyed her classes as well (Lisa, maybe?).  These 2 instructors really pushed you to your limit, in a good way.  They were not overbearing, and when presenting one of the more challenging activities, they often gave an alternate activity that was less strenuous.  They were very encouraging as well. "You can do it!"     Sometimes there would be some of the younger girls substitute teaching the classes; I didn't enjoy them as much.  They seemed to have friends in the class and it was very "cliquey," and very high school-like.  Luckily, I only had to deal with that twice out of my 2-week stint.   Awesome workout. I would definitely recommend it, especially for women.  It's very empowering. In just 2 weeks I felt and looked stronger (bicep guns, FTW!) and I'd loss weight.   It's a decent sized facility; not too big, not too small. Lots of punching bags, a boxing ring, and a couple of workout machines.  There are free lockers for storing your belongings.  Clean restroom facilities.   The only thing that I don't like is that their prices are not clearly posted.  I feel like when a company doesn't publicize their prices, they can randomly charge whatever they like. For example, Jane Doe, may be told to pay x amount for a membership, but John Doe is given a different price.  NOT saying that this establishment does that.  I just think they should post their membership prices, to assure fairness.  I was sad when my 2 weeks were up.  Amanda, from the front desk,  called me to see if I wanted to continue.  When I called back I spoke with a guy.  He advised I could get a $69/month rate with a 12 month contract. But then there's the enrollment fee, and you have to pay for more than 1 month up front.  I do not recall how much it was to go month-to-month, but it was substantially more.   Overall, I enjoyed this Title Boxing Club location, and I may return once my 6 months are up and I'm eligible again for the Groupon deal (you have to wait 6 months).   Hidden location. It's tucked behind the mall area that's on the NE corner of Tatum & Cactus. If you go east on Cactus from Tatum, it'll be on the left/north. Take the street next to the Ghengis Grill, but make a right into that parking lot across the street. It's behind the Darden restaurants.

I was referred to Dre's Salon by a co-worker. My stylist, Marisa, just so happens to come from my hometown, which gave me instant comfort.  Marisa is very knowledgeable about hair care, and she showed me how to wear my hair naturally curly, and she suggested great products to keep my hair from frizzing.  Since moving to the desert, my hair gets very dry, very fast.  Thankfully, now I have a new summer 'do, which is care-free and heat-free.  I plan to go back soon to add a splash of color!

After seeing a fellow Yelper's Caramelized Cauliflower dish, I was super anxious to try it.  I asked for extra tahini sauce and was given a large side order of it at no extra charge.  The cauliflower was very tasty, but I agree that it tastes even better when re-heated in my toaster oven the next day.  Yes, there's enough to either share or save 1/2 for another day. The seasoning and the tahini sauce make this dish awesome. I have returned for this dish, and it was even better the second time around.  Yum!  I've only ordered take-out thus far, so I'll update once I have a dine-in experience.

After working all day at a convention downtown, I was starving and in dire need of nourishment.  It was after 9pm on a Sunday evening, and this was about the only place (that I know of) open in the area where I could get something veggie.  I love that this location has a drive-thru.  The girl taking my order needed a lesson in manners, but when I got to the window, I had someone nicer assisting me.  I got my sandwich and it was NOT what I had ordered. It was instead, a bland and dry imitation of what I wanted. *hard sigh*  I don't like wasting money but I was super hungry so I scarfed it down.  I won't go so far as to say I'd never return. However, if I ever find myself needing to revisit, I'll definitely double-check my order prior to leaving.  Also, that drive-thru is very narrow, especially when pulling away from the window. So watch out for the curbs on each side of your rims.

If you're looking for healthy, fresh and delicious vegan and/or raw options, look no further than 24 Carrots.  My first visit here was on Mother's Day of this year. I got a naked breakfast burrito, sans vegan cheese. It was perfectly seasoned and I was so pleasantly surprised by how fresh the veggies tasted.  The breakfast burrito comes with bacon, but my bowl was lacking the veggie bacon. However, I didn't mention the snafu.  My DD ordered Banana Foster pancakes and she let me taste them. They were... interesting? They had a weird consistency; not pancake-y at all. We wondered if maybe they were gluten-free? But again, we didn't ask. The service was good, and I love that we were given our own personal water pitcher.   I finally went back to try some of the lunch items that I'd been eye-balling for months.  Smokey BLT club (no T): I got mine with a side of chips and salsa. Very tasty and flavorful, although I am not a fan of their veggie bacon. It's not firm or crunchy enough for my liking. And I didn't like the salsa; it's very tomato-y, and I don't like tomatoes (hence my holding the "T" from the BLT). The aioli sauce on the sandwich was bomb though.  Buffalo Cauliflower wrap: I got mine extra spicy, no celery or carrots, but with a side of carrots and hummus. OMG. Let me tell you... Ask and ye shall receive. *waves church fan* That Sriracha was KICKING! I needed the earth and the wind to calm that fire! It was, however, amazingly delicious. Sometimes, a dish is just all heat, and no flavor. But no. The flavor was definitely present, along with that heat. I like hot and spicy foods, so the watering eyes, burning buds, and duck lips trying to such in the air flow to cool my mouth was all good times for me. For kicks, I'll try it with the normal spice level next time to see how I like it. Excellent dish!   Desserts:  Puddin Pear tart. It was tasty, but not worth the $5.50 they charge for the tiny slither they give you.  Black Forest Cake: Yes! Moist, decadent chocolate cake, with a sweet and creamy icing on top and in the middle, topped with a cherry. Divine! Definitely worth the $6.25.   Lots of smoothie options (I've never tried any of them). 100% vegan, lots of organic and raw options for foods and desserts. Food is always fresh and it's filling, yet light. They support local farms and businesses.  The owner likes to switch up the menu. I like this concept. I keep checking their Facebook page to see when they'll re-introduce the meatloaf that I want so badly to try.   A solid 4.5, but I think some things are over priced, and I don't like the fact that there is still no overhead signage. If you don't know where you're going, it's a pain trying to find it.   Oh, and the hours on here are currently wrong. They are currently open 8am-7pm, Tue-Sat, and 8am-2pm on Sundays; closed Mondays. Not sure if the hours will change come winter, so it's best to call ahead to double check.

In case anyone has doubts about the reviews from others because they've written few reviews and/or have no friends, let me assure you that what they've said is true.   1st - When we arrived, there was a roped off section (yes, like the VIP or club style velvet rope-off) and a bouncer (basically) between the rope and the entrance to the door.  Did I need to go home and change, because obviously I'm underdressed for whatever is happening here?  Nope.  Jeans were fine. The bouncer-guy said that there was limited staff so they were only allowing so many patrons in at one time.  Really?? Okaaaay. Like I said... Club.  Anyway, after standing in the smoldering August sun for 5 minutes, we were blessed with entry into this Michael Kors. I immediately spotted @ 10 employees running around, none of whom greeted me, but they greeted EVERY else one around me. Not good.  And there weren't that many customers. There was almost one employee for every guest, so I do not know what was up with the whole waiting outside thing.   I continued to look for my PVC wallet, which is why I like MK. I do not buy leather, and they have nice PVC options, and they were having a 40% off sale. But during my 10-15 minutes of browsing, I STILL never had anyone ask to assist me.  If I hadn't been desperate for a wallet, I would've left and gone to the MK Outlet at Anthem instead.    During the check-out process, the lady assisting me was nice.  When she asked who was helping me I promptly informed her that I'd be ignored by the entire staff.  She looked to her left at the manager standing next to her. After a couple of seconds of silence, the manager looked up at me and said, "Sorry," with the most condescending tone in her voice and scour upon her face.  She should have kept that phony apology.  The check-out girl continued and appeared to look for a code cheat-sheet. I assume that they get commission in here and that cheat sheet had codes for associates. Well, I did not want any of those heifas getting commission for my purchase! But what could I do? Ugh!  It's ok. You enjoy that little commission, but you'll never get another one from me. Ever!

When they first opened, back in March or April of this year, they sent out coupons in the neighborhood mailers, which is how I learned about them.   VEGAN INFO: I needed the skinny on their vegan options for a vegan site, so I spoke with a manager and requested a list of their ingredients.  She was very helpful and patient, and luckily Foosia has a list of the ingredients for all of their sauces and toppings (I promise you, not every restaurant/eatery does).   All of the sauces are vegan except the Muay Thai Vinaigrette, which contains a fish  byproduct.    As for the toppings, everything was vegan except for the hard boiled eggs (duh), and  the crispy wonton wrappers, which contain eggs.   My most recent visit: I went in tonight, after 8:30pm (they close at 9pm), thinking I'd just see if they had anything left that still looked fresh.  It's extremely rare that I eat past 7pm, but Manic Monday + back to school shopping left me drained and in need of healthy nourishment, STAT. As I peeked through the looking glass searching for the tofu, one of the employees offered to help me. "Are you out of tofu?" I asked.  He said, "Yes, but we can make some more."  I was like, "No, that's ok. I know it's almost closing time." But he insisted and assured me that it was no problem, and he was very genuine about it.  It had been a few months since I visited so I couldn't recall which sauce was my fav.  He happily allowed me to taste a few and my Holy Foobanero (a spicy sauce with a hit of sweetness) love was rediscovered.  By the time my sauce taste test was over, my tofu was ready.  The employee (maybe he was a manager; if he isn't, he deserves a promotion) asked if I'd like to dine in; I graciously declined.  As he packed my to-go order, he re-assured me that I was welcome back any time.  Usually when you enter an establishment close to closing time you're greeted with the daggers-of-death stares and major attitude. Not here.  The man (should be manager), and even the cook would cooked up my fresh order of tofu, was so very nice and friendly that it really put a smile on my face. It also made me feel bad for taking so long to come back.    The food? My (late) vegan meal consisted of brown rice, tofu, wok glazed veggies (which were still fresh), fresno chiles, green onions, and extra Holy Foobanero.  It was so fresh and so good. Simply delicious. Filling too, yet not heavy. I could only eat 1/2 of it. I did notice that the prices increased slightly; a tofu bowl was $7.50 in April, now it's $8. Just an observation.   I like that they seem to be eco-friendly too, from the to-go containers to the napkins. And they have designated recycle bins inside the restaurant, which has a nice, large, clean, open dining area.   So again, the food in and of itself is very good (healthy, fresh, & flavorful!), but the excellent customer service kicked my experience up several more notches.  I will frequent them much more often.

I remember when I first saw the sign displaying "RAW Organic Food & Juice," before they opened their doors, and I was so excited to have a vegan eatery within walking distance of my home.  I'm not even a raw vegan, but the idea still excited me!  I walked in... No one spoke.  I looked at their overhead menu boards and saw things like chicken and salmon, but no indication of them being faux.  So I asked the girl behind the counter about vegan items and she had NO clue what I was talking about.  She called some other lady from the back. Lady #2 came out and advised that she could make a bowl or wrap vegan with lentils, black beans, or quinoa as their protein options.  Oh. So this is not a raw vegan place.  That is my fault for assuming. They had fresh juices, some raw veggies (i.e. carrots & spinach), and that's about the end of their raw line.  I was so disgusted that I left without buying anything that day.  I finally went back this weekend (months later) and tried the Fiesta Bowl. Per their  online menu, it's $6 for a brown rice bowl. It comes with tomatoes, but I requested to get spinach instead of tomatoes (since I don't eat tomatoes). I was charged $8 as a base price for this $6 bowl.   The bowl was large and contained hot, cooked brown rice, black beans, and corn, raw onions, raw spinach, avocado, and a red basil dressing/sauce.  It was ok. The red basil dressing/sauce (vegan) was pretty tasty, but overall it was just an ok meal.  Nothing special or memorable about it, and I definitely wouldn't go even 2 steps out of my way for it.   They no longer had the fresh juice machines. I heard another customer inquiring about them as I was leaving.  They directed her to some refrigerated, bottled juices.  This business looks like it may be on its last leg.  I personally still feel jaded by their name. Branding your business as RAW Food & Juice, but having minimal raw options?  With a name like that, you know you're going to attract raw foodist and veg*ns. It just seems shady. AND they overcharged me! Not a fan. Won't return.

I went early this morning and dined in.  Driving south on N Scottsdale Rd, I could see the "Scramble" sign facing the street, so it was an easy find.  Parking seemed a little odd to me.  There are only a few parking spaces in front of the restaurant, and there are a lot of stores that share the same parking lot. I imagine parking is a real pain later in the day, but that early in the morning it was fine.   On to the food.  I like that there is a section on their menu titled Vegan, so you don't have to go searching for all those little "v" or "vg" symbols used by most places. This makes things so much simpler.  Because it was my first time at a Scramble (I have yet to visit their downtown location), I wanted to try a couple of things so I'd know what to get on any future visits.   Vegan French Toast: It was quite good, tasty even, but not mind-blowing. It was sprinkled with powdered sugar (which I love!) and I didn't even need to put the vegan butter on it.  I was grateful for the sweet and thick vegan syrup. Some vegan syrups can be watery and boring; not theirs. The toast was a bit challenging to cut (or maybe my utensil-using skills are challenged); I was seriously afraid that a piece of syrup-laden toast was gonna go catapulting through the air and into another patron's hair/face, etc.  I tried to carefully see-saw my way through it... I hope no one was watching me.  It wasn't that the bread was hard; it just took a lot of effort once you got to the bottom of that bread. Maybe it's the bread? Maybe it's me? I don't know. But honestly, it was still very good; just not amazing. It came with a side of fruit (actually she asked me what I wanted for my side and I just stuck with the fruit), which was fresh and sweet.   Scramble: So, here's what I did with my scramble. I wanted to try the Vegan Soyrizo Burrito, sans tortilla, but I wanted the spinach and red onions that come with another vegan scramble dish. And I'd read some reviews saying that the scramble could use a little more seasoning.  So I simply requested no tortilla, add spinach + red onions, add extra seasoning and make it extra spicy. I also requested that they cook it hard (I don't like mushy tofu scramble). The result was yummy! It was perfectly spiced. Kudos to the chef for hooking me up! (I believe they said they added jalapeño juice and Sriracha sauce.) For the side, I got the sweet potato hash.  It was good. I think if you're a sweet potato fan (y'all who must have your baked sweet potatoes & sweet potato fries) then you'll love it. I love regular potatoes, so next time I'll get the good ole hash browns. (I checked with a manager, who said they're vegan: cooked with salt, pepper, & garlic (no butter).   The food is very light too. I ate 1/2 of each dish and I didn't feel "heavy" like I do after some taste-testing sessions, which is great for a morning, start-your-day meal.   Pricing? For Scottsdale, it's inexpensive. My vegan french toast was less than $8, and my vegan soyrizo scramble was less than $9.   Inside was nice, neat, clean, bright (sunshiny), and had a large, open dining area. There were mostly tables, but around the southern perimeter there is booth seating along the wall, with additional chairs across from the tables.  There is a center station with condiments, self-serve drinks (water for me), utensils, etc.  There were several large TVs, each showing something different: sports, worldwide news, cartoons, and some other cable network cooking show were all on for you to glance towards and enhance your lip-reading skills. (Sub-titles were on for those too lazy for lip-reading) I sat inside, although I couldn't help but notice how cute the patio area was. It's a large/spacious patio too. I'm sure it'll get a lot of action come autumn.   The employees are all very nice, offering up friendly smiles and being attentive and helpful.  3 different people asked how my meal was as they walked by.   I would love to see them expand their vegan menu (ahem: vegan pancakes!), but for now I'm happy to have somewhere to go for a vegan breakfast that's not 30+ minutes away.

I've just recently learned of the fabulousness that is Ike's Love & Sandwiches, and I am a big fan!    This was my first time at the Mesa location. I ordered the Vegan Pilgrim (vegan turkey, cranberry sauce, Sriracha, vegan dirty sauce + lettuce [I omitted the vegan cheese]) on their french roll/bread. I know, I know. That combination makes no sense, right? Wrong! I've learned to leave my inhibitions down the street and around the corner, and to just trust Ike's on whatever his board says. It. Was. So. Good!  (1/2 of this sandwich never made it out of my parking space!) Cranberry sauce + Sriracha on a "turkey" sandwich? Who'd a "thunk"?!  That's mostly what you'll find here. An amazing concoction of drool & moan-worthy creations (Meg Ryan/Sally, you ain't ready, girl!), surrounded by delicious, homemade bread. Their Dutch Crunch bread is a must try!  They also have a few simple sandwiches, for you retired daredevils.   Supposedly, there are 100 veggie sandwich options, most of which can be veganized. So for all of my fellow vegans, just be sure to tell them to make it vegan. Here's a vegan breakdown: They use Daiya for the cheeses, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs.  All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat).  The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version.  The "Air" fries and tater tots are vegan (and they are baked, not fried). Their Dirty Sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version (it's delicious!) Their purple coleslaw is vegan. There's a vegan french dressing and BBQ sauce.  Not vegan:  Their pesto, honey mustard sauce, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses).  Sun-Devil sauce is NOT vegan & there is no vegan version.  Veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan.  They have gluten-free options.   The girl helping me out was super nice and knowledgeable about their vegan menu. I had a question about the french dressing, and she had a handy-dandy cheat sheet which she used to confirm that it is vegan (or they have a vegan option; I didn't clarify).  Most of the sandwiches are @ $10, but they are big enough to either share or save 1/2 for another day. They offer chips (most of which are vegan too; just avoid the Salt & Vinegar and the BBQ Ranch), bottled and fountain drinks. Nice sized location with plenty of tables and booths inside. There are only a couple of tables outside. It shares a big parking lot with other establishments, so there is plenty of parking.  Located about 3 lights north of US 60, off of the Alma School exit, on the east side of the street (opposite side of the street from the Fiesta Mall).   Ike's is like the Lady Gaga of sandwiches: extravagant, daring, and shockingly good. I can't wait to go back.

I had family coming in, the house was a mess, and Cinderella had escaped. I was frantic to find someone to clean & tidy my place at short notice.  I learned about Handybook via an Amazon deal. I came to Yelp to read the reviews and saw any even better deal here. I got 3 hours of cleaning services for only $19! That's unheard of!  And luckily for me, they were able to schedule me someone at short notice. Amazing!  My cleaning specialist arrived right on time. Actually, a little early, which was great because she was able to do a walk through and ask any questions without it cutting into the cleaning time. She was very nice and personable, but not at all too chatty (as I've experienced with others ). There was no signage on her car, but she wore a uniform and the company's name was on her shirt.   She worked for 3 hours on my 2 1/2 level home (just her; no team), and she did a really good job. The only reason I didn't give it that extra/ 5th star is because there were a couple of things that were missed, and she seemed to lack some basic cleaning supplies/tools.   Overall, good service, great deal. I'd use them again.

Typical Target. Nicely organized, large, open, well stocked, and luckily open late for the Xmas holiday season.  After shopping in Desert Ridge mall, we needed some packing supplies. We rode by and discovered they were open until 11pm. Winning!    If you plan to ship presents this holiday season, keep in mind that places like FedEx and UPS charge more for their shipping supplies. Save a few bucks by buying your boxes and packing supplies here.  We found some things that we needed, got some things we didn't need, and forgot some things that we did need (typical shopping trip for me).  After the diligent reminder that the store would be closing in 5 minutes, we scurried to the check out lines.  There were plenty of open lanes so it was a fast process.  And our cashier was perky and humorous at the end of what I'm sure was a long shift, which was awesome to me.

We finally got a Tropical Smoothie Cafe in the N Scottsdale area!  This little gem opened up in April 2014, and I have since made my way through every low-fat smoothie (vegans, don't forget to omit the yogurt from the smoothies that list it).    My favorite smoothies are: Mango Magic (sans yogurt) & Hawaiian Breeze (sans yogurt) - both are great and refreshing following a work-out or a 5 second walk from your car to the store in the summer; same sweaty difference.   Acai Berry Boost - one of the "Supercharged" smoothies for when I need a morning pick-me-up. It's vegan.  The Blimey Limey (a sweet meet tart taste) and the Kiwi Quencher (sans yogurt; has a Starburst-y flavor) are my other 2 go-to flavors.  These 24 oz smoothies are a filling breakfast for me, and they're currently 1/2 off the price during their 7am-9am happy hour (8am-9am on weekends), so I get breakfast for less than $2.50!    A list of supplements are available to add to your smoothie.  They also have breakfast wraps, but these are not vegan, so I haven't tried them.    For lunch or dinner, they have flatbreads, toasted wraps, sandwiches, and salads, AND they offer Beyond Meat "chicken" as a vegan replacement option in these items. The Thai "Chicken" wrap is very tasty and vegan as is (when ordered w/ Beyond Meat, of course).  The Southwest "Chicken" wrap is also good. Omit the ranch dressing if you're vegan. The Jamaican Jerk "Chicken" (sans cheese) is tasty, but their jerk sauce is not as spicy as I'd like.  The wraps are large. There is a 1/2 wrap, 1/2 smoothie option as well.    They sell chips, and baked varieties are available. Fruit is also available as a side.   The employees are always nice and helpful. Unfortunately, they aren't very knowledgeable about the ingredients. Apparently, this information just isn't readily available to them. (They couldn't tell me if there was dairy in their buffalo sauce.)  Sign up for text messages and receive random deals. You may order online.  Location: off of Mayo Blvd, west of N Scottsdale Rd, in the Scottsdale 101 shopping area. Shares the parking lot w/ Red Robin, Chick-Fil-A and it's next to Starbucks and the Subway.  Rather small location. I think there are 5 or 6 tables inside. There is only 1 outdoor table.

As a pretty big movie buff, I was hesitant to partake in the whole secret movie thing, but delving into the unknown is quite the adventure itself, so I decided to go for it.   This was my first time visiting the FilmBar, but it was an easy find. I found metered parking on the street, so I initially parked there, fed the meter all of my coins, and went inside to get more change. The nice men inside informed me of their free parking lot adjacent to the north side of the building. I quickly re-parked.  The event coordinator, Lindsey, greeted me immediately with a smile and a beverage ticket. I don't drink (I know, I know. Straight edge AND vegan? *eye-roll*), so I was going to decline the ticket until she told me I could use it for the non-alcoholic drinks as well. Yay!  I was also advised that outside food could be brought in. What?! I don't have to bring my airplane carry-on sized purse, sneakily filled with treats? Awesome!  I'm normally an H2O girl, however, their selection of Orange Cream, Vanilla Cream, and Mexican Coke sodas gave me cause for extra thought.  I was schooled on what a Mexican Coke is - basically, a coke with natural cane sugar; none of that high fructose corn syrup stuff.  Sounds really cool. I ended up getting an Orange Cream, and it was yummy... AND free!   I entered into the auditorium and was gifted with a surprise goodie bag. More awesomeness!   I took an end seat and awaited my fate... What is it going to be? Will I hate it? The anticipation was strangling my sense of composure. Then, it was revealed: Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. I hadn't seen that movie since I was a pre-teen! All those gushy Tiger Beat/ Teen Bop emotions, which I hoarded for Keanu, came rushing back, and for about 90 minutes, I was blissfully 12 years old again.   Thank you, Lindsey, for a most excellent event and nostalgic evening! Party on dudes! \m/

I went in for their Grand Opening party, and it was a pleasantly posh event.    They offered a wide selection of hors d'oeuvres (sushi, sandwich bites, chicken, fruits, veggies and dip, etc) and mini bundt cakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes.  There were vendors onsite and drink offerings from wine to water.  They offered deals on their memberships that evening as well.  It's a beautiful salon and it was elegantly decorated for the holiday season.  Several TVs are suspended from the walls, so they're easily visible from wherever you may be positioned in the salon (aside from the wash bowls).   I love the chairs at the wash bowls.  They are very comfortable and you may prop up your feet, if you wish.  A warm towel is placed under the nape of your neck. Very cozy! My hair was thoroughly washed and the 5-minute massage is absolutely my favorite part of the process.  It's so relaxing. I'm pretty sure that I snoozed off for a few minutes.   When leaving the wash area, I noticed a small beverage cooler/case which was stocked with different sodas, juices and water.  I'm assuming they are complimentary for guests, but I wasn't thirsty so I didn't ask. I'll be sure to ask about it next time.  The chairs at the styling stations are also very nice. The pillow makes them perfectly comfortable for me.  I got a blow dry plus a hot tool (flat iron), and my hair came out very silky and shiny.  Lovely job on my ethnic hair.  They used a new product (I don't recall the name of the brand) which was very light (as in it didn't weigh down my hair) and it smelled delightful.   To top off the night, I left with an awesome goody bag, filled with all kinds of cool goodies.   This Primp & Blow is in a very nice location along the up and coming High Street (near Desert Ridge) area. Street parking can be challenging during certain times.  I know there's a garage somewhere close, but I lucked upon a spot across the street.  I'll look for the garage next time.  This location is now the closest one to me so I do plan to frequent here.

I dragged my feet on checking this place out because I was thinking it's just a sandwich; no big deal. I was SO wrong!  I checked out their website ahead of time, which has a "vegan" tab for each Ike's location, so I was already familiar with some of the vegan offerings.  But when I arrived, there were so many more options jumping out a me. Luckily, the employees know their stuff when it comes to their vegan menu, and they were able to answer my questions.  I ordered the Handsome Owl (sans cheese): vegan chicken, teriyaki, Wasabi Mayo, lettuce, onions, pickles, & banana peppers, on Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch bread. OMG! I don't know what sorcery they used to conjure up that bread's amazing and unique flavor, but it is phenomenal! The combinations of all the flavors that encompass the sandwich is ingenious.  My mind is blown. It's a $10 sandwich, but it's huge, filling, and worth every single penny.  I will certainly return to try all of the vegan combinations.   They sell Zapp's potato chips, which come in a variety of colorfully named flavors, like "Voodoo Heat," "Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño,"Sweet Creole Onion," etc.  Looking at the ingredients on the bags (and I have since checked Zapp's website), it appears that only the Salt & Vinegar, and BBQ Ranch chips are not vegan (they contain a milk product), and all except the Mesquite BBQ are gluten-free. However, the source of the natural smoke flavor and "natural flavor" needs to be confirmed.  I also spotted MSG in at least one flavor.  I tried the Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño chips. I wasn't impressed. 0 heat. Not 1 hint of spice. And the taste was a little off; almost on the stale side, but the bag showed a November expiration date. Not sure what that was about. Next time I'll try a different flavor to see if there's any change.    Management informed me of the following:  50% of the veggie sandwiches can be made vegan upon request.  They use Daiya for the vegan cheese, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs.  All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat). The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version. Their Dirty sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version, (which is delicious, btw! Add it to your sandwich, or get it on the side and dip your sandwich in it. YUM!) Fries (called "Air Fries") are vegan; they are baked, not fried. Tater tots are vegan.   Not vegan: pesto, & honey mustard sauces, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses).  CORRECTION: Their Sun-Devil (a nod to Arizona State University/ ASU) is not vegan, & they do NOT have a vegan version. (The photo I added is actually their vegan Dirty sauce.)  Their veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan  Gluten-free bread available upon request.  I love the way it's decorated. It has a very warm, happy, and welcoming vibe. Friendly and vegan-knowledgable employees. Fountain drinks or bottled drinks available. Open late (until midnight) on Fri/Sat. There are few outside tables. Located in the heart of Tempe, next to the Bank of America off Mill, between 6th & 7th. Typical downtown Tempe street or paid lot parking.  SANDWICHES = MIND BLOWN!

I first noticed them a couple of months ago when we were going the movie theatre next door, but ignored them because typically, there's nothing in a Burger & Hot Dog joint for a vegan. But after checking their website and the Yelp reviews, I discovered that they have veggie options, so I decided to give them a try.  (My review is based solely on the veggie options.)   VEGAN BURGER: It's actually one of the first things I saw when entering this establishment.  They proudly featured "Vegan Burgers" on their display board.  The owner explained that the burger patty is homemade and gluten-free.  They also offer gluten-free buns (which I did not try).   The burger was fresh and tasty.  I'm not great in the kitchen, so unlike some, I can't pinpoint specific ingredients, but I think I saw rice and grains... maybe some quinoa? Totally guessing. But it's a great, healthy, soy-free and vegan option, which you get to decorate with a variety of options from their toppings bar.    HOT DOGS: They do not offer a vegan hot dog at this time, but they do have a soy-based vegetarian hot dog.  When I initially asked about the hot dog the woman was honest, yet evasive, about why it wasn't vegan. I asked if it contains dairy, to which she replied yes, but the vagueness was killing me.  I'm a local ambassador for a vegan website, so I needed a little more information.   1/2 way through my veggie burger I asked her again.  She brought over the packaging so that I could see the ingredients.  Allergens were soy, wheat, and eggs (no dairy).  I think she was trying to keep the brand a secret. I don't care about that; I only care about the ingredients.  I was grateful that she gave me the courtesy of showing me the ingredients on the package, which immediately gave me peace of mind. I didn't want to share mis-information.    FRENCH FRIES: 1st - The way Bubba, from Forest Gump, was a shrimp aficionado, is how I am with potatoes.  So when I glazed upon their various options, though not extensive, I was still joyous.  And they allow you to split the flavors.  So if you'd like to try the Cajun fries and the Garlic, you can do 1/2 and 1/2. Sweet! This is exactly what I did.     The Cajun seasoning definitely had some kick, but wasn't too spicy.  The Garlic seasoning was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  The waffle fries were fresh and crisp.  Honestly, I could come here just for the fries and be completely satisfied.    The prices are completely reasonable, in my opinion.   I watched the owner as she greeted familiar faces when they ordered, and later walked around to each table asking how the food was for everyone.  She obviously enjoys and takes pride in her business, which is a lovely thing to witness.  I will continue to support this small business.  I do, however, hope that a vegan hot dog option is offered in the future. There are so many awesome vegan hot dog options right across the street at Whole Foods.  Pick up a pack, grill it, bun it, and sell it. Save me the trouble of cooking or grilling; I'll buy it!

My Vegas expert and Yelp amiga, Elizabeth B, has been extremely helpful with the vegan eatery suggestions.  After reading her review, I drove over here for some potato tacos and nachos.  I received 3 potato tacos and they were crispy and delicioso. I requested no pico de gallo since I don't like tomatoes, however, I got mucho de gallo instead.  It's ok; I brushed it aside, although I lost a lot of my salsa.  The beans and rice were ok, but I could've used a tad bit more sabor (flavor) in both.  The nachos were ok. The portion was huge and I love that it was piled high with veggies.  I asked for both spicy red salsa and the green salsa.  I only received a small amount of red salsa; enough for the potato tacos only.  My nachos would've been a lot better to me with more spicy salsa.    They did not have any vegan desserts (I asked).   Inside is small, but comfy, like abuelita's cocina.  The lady at the counter was very pleasant.  Prices are reasonable. Located in a strip mall, so there was plenty of parking. I'd go back for more potato tacos and to try other menu items.

I honestly did not care for the cupcakes or the cookies. Both had a grainy/ earthy taste that I did not like. However, the blueberry loaf that I got was delicious! It was full of blueberries and topped with a lemon glaze. They were selling them by the slice or you could get a whole loaf. It was my first time and I wasn't sure if I'd like it so I only got a slice, but I wish I'd gotten an entire loaf instead.  It's located in a strip mall. I'd go back to try more bread/loaf flavors.

Someone told me about this place and it did not disappoint.  This place is huge and they have so much stuff!  For my inner fangirl, there was a life-sized Thor standee for only $35, which I'll be going back to get after the gifting-to-others season is over.  There were a variety of toys and collectibles, from classic to modern. Knick-knacks, trading cards, and a plethora of comic books.  Somethings were decently priced, others seemed like they were over-priced to me, but I'm no collectibles expert so those prices may have been in line with the product.   There is also a massive museum, in which the owner showcases his extensive collection of all things pop-culture.  There's a fee to enter, but I was in a hurry and didn't inquire about the cost. Maybe next time... When I return for my Thor.

I'd been anxiously awaiting their opening day, ever since I saw their signage go up in December 2014. Today was the day.  Inside is spacious and open. There is a refrigerated case stocked with bottled drinks, but there is also a fountain machine for soft drinks.  I also liked that they offered different Bragg's condiments (Hello Nutritional Yeast Seasoning!) as well as Sriracha sauce and other options. In true cafe style, there are a handful of tables inside and a few tables outside as well.  My personal favorite here (as far as decor) are the canvassed pictures of Santorini along the wall. It makes me long for my bucket list trip to Greece.   On to the food... This was my first time at Pita Cafe (there is another location further north on Scottsdale Rd), and the worker (owner?) was very nice, helpful, and patient. He answered all of my vegan-y questions. Luckily, this place is very veg*n-friendly. (There are plenty of meat options for you carnivores, but as a vegan, I will focus on their veg*n options.)   For starters/ appetizers, there are several different flavors of hummus, Veggies Dolmas, Spanakopita (vegetarian, but not vegan due to the feta cheese), veggies and dip, Veggie platter, Baba Ghanoush, etc.  If you enjoy pitas, they have a Veggie Pita (omit the taziki sauce to make it vegan), Grilled Veggie Pita, Hummus &  Tabouli Pita, and of course Falafel Pita.  There are also quite a few (7!!) veg*n salads (if you're vegan just remember to omit any cheeses and the taziki sauce; it contains dairy). For bigger appetites they have platters. Veg*ns can choose from a Falafel platter or Dolma platter. Both come with your choice of 2 sides.   I ended up getting the Falafel platter and the Dipitizer. (Wait for it!)   FALAFEL PLATTER: My Falafel platter came with 6 perfectly seasoned and cooked falafel balls, what looked like a red and white onion mix, a whole piece of falafel bread, and it normally comes with taziki sauce but he allowed me to substitute for a small cup of hummus (which was perfect). For my 2 sides, I got rice and a greek salad without the cheese.  Their rice is NOT made with animal broth or animal by-products, so it's completely vegan-friendly.  It was very good and the portion was very generous.  Same with the salad. No okie-doke, Baby Stewie portions here. It was a full container (I had a carry-out order) of luscious greenery.   DIPITIZER: This is for my double-dippers! Raise your pitas in the air! Then dip 'em like you just don't care! Oh yeah!   You get to try different hummus flavors plus a third dipping dish, which the menu lists as taziki, but again, the worker (owner??) was SO nice and accommodating that he allowed me to sub for Baba Ghanoush (which IS vegan).   1-JALAPEÑO HUMMUS: Delicious AND it had some spicy kick to it (unlike some other places). Perfect! 2 - ROASTED RED PEPPER HUMMUS: yummy! 3 - HUMMUS: the original hummus flavor, but there is nothing ordinary about it. It's very fresh and each ingredient is distinctly present. Easily the BEST hummus  that I have had in the Phoenix area.  4 - BABA GHANOUSH: it's a pureed eggplant dish, so it's good for dipping. The flavor was amazing! The eggplant tasted as if it was fresh off the grill and into the mixer. Some of the best Baba Ghanoush I've ever had. (Even if you typically don't like eggplant - like myself - I suggest trying it.)  They don't offer Tahini sauce as a side option, nor do they have french fries.  The tahini apparently isn't popular, so that's an understandable business decision. But the other location offers french fries (goes fabulously with a pita sandwich), but they do not... I had my mouth all ready for some fries. But regardless, I still love this place. Excellent food, excellent customer service.  FYI - they also have gluten free pita options (for an additional charge).  The owner is working on labeling items as veg*n and "gluten-free options available."  DD got the Chicken Pita and she loved it. In her words, "I should've gotten 2!" Not because it was small, but because it was so good.   (You can get the Chicken Pita or Gyros for only $5; available all day.)  Looking for them? They are on North Scottsdale Rd, north of FLW/Bell (the tall blue sphere), on the right side of the street (if traveling northbound). They share the parking lot with Sushi Brokers, AT&T, Nothing Bundt Cakes, etc. If you pass the Fairmont, you've gone too far.

My first time here was on a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly empty. There was a lunch buffet, but they also allowed us to order from the menu.  Because it was my first time, I went for the buffet so I could taste several items to see what I did and did not like. I had some very tasty dishes (apologies for not knowing the names of what I got; some items were marked, others were not. Then it all got mushed together on my plate, so..), and the owner was very friendly and helpful. He pointed out everything that was vegan-friendly, which was most of the buffet. I think only 1 or 2 things were non-vegan (but vegetarian). He did the same thing with the sauces, so I wouldn't pick out anything with dairy in it. Then he gave me suggestions on items to mix for a yummy dipping sauce for the dosa, which comes with the buffet. Very nice!  My DD (a non-veg*n) wanted Aloo Saag. It's a spinach and potato dish which we were accustom to eating at our fav Indian restaurant in St. Louis. It was not on the menu here but they agreed to make it without any thought or hesitation. DD loved it!    We returned on Mother's Day and we both ordered Aloo Saag. DD got the regular version and I ordered the vegan version.  (FYI - If you want to try it vegan you should specifically ask because this dish is made with cream/dairy unless you request it vegan.) It was so delicious!  Perfectly spiced and excellently executed for a non-listed menu item.   I got Poori (vegan deep-fried bread), which tasted great with my Aloo Saag. DD got naan, which she loved as well.  The owner did seem a little peeved this time that we didn't eat off of the buffet, but being that we got what we wanted AND it was delicious, I won't hold that against him.   My only concern is that I don't know how much I paid for everything because there was no detailed receipt. I spent $32 and some change for our 2 entrees + 2 orders of breads (poori & naan); we had water.  On my first visit we paid $9 for DD's Aloo Saag. The breads are @ $3.99 each, so I feel like I was over-charged for something.  Next time, I'll be sure to get a breakdown of everything.   Delicious, flavorful food. Clean restaurant and restrooms. Attentive, helpful, and friendly staff and owner.  I will go back again.  (Re directions: My iPhone map had me going in circles. If you come from the 101 and are traveling on Warner, it will be in that strip mall to your right, before you pass the Dobson intersection.)

3 1/2 stars, really. Potato Salad.  Potato Salad. POTATO SALAD! This is my way of expressing just how much I LOVE their potato salad, which made me give them 4 stars instead of 3. Coming from Missouri, which has very "southern" roots and ways, I love a creamy, mayo-based potato salad, but had not been able to find a good one since becoming vegan.  The search is over. As I ate my potato salad in my car, I contemplated going back to ask for the rest of their pot, tupperware bowl, etc. I need this in bulk! (They should sell it at Sam's or Costco!) Moving on...  I also got 2 orders of the Sassy Wings, but one order was buffalo sauce only. While the flavor of the sauce was very good, I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of their wings; they were too thick.  I prefer a thinner, less "faux-meaty" consistency. They were just ok, to me.  I ordered a side of their Fabulous Fries, which were excellent in flavor/seasoning.    I also got their Country Classic, which, per the menu, comes with crispy tempeh & tofu cutlets (1 of each), collard greens,mashed potatoes, and cornbread. Sounds like a proper southern meal. However, to my dismay, I ended up with a cauliflower, broccoli, and carrot medley instead of the promised greens. (I had hot sauce in my bag for those greens!) I didn't like the cornbread or the cutlets. I was disappointed, to say the least. The mashed potatoes were good though.   The carrot cake that I ordered was delicious.  I was supposed to get a free Red Rockin' Chili with my Yelp check-in, and she even marked it as "Used" on my app, however, it was MIA from my to-go bag.   I may not have had the best experience with all of the food I ordered, but I still really like this place. The vibe was mellow, light auras, friendly worker, clean and welcoming environment, and the prices are fair. It's in a strip mall, so there is plenty of parking, and there is signage everywhere... On each corner for each intersecting street and on the front and back of the building, which was extremely helpful for me as I was looking for it. I will be back to try other menu items, and of course, for more tater salad.

After months and months of anticipation, the 1st annual Arizona Veg Food festival finally arrived.   TICKETS: 2 ticket types were available: general admission for $24, and VIP for $50. In November & December, Amazon Local offered 1/2 off of both entry options. A couple of weeks before the festival, Groupon offered 1/2 off of the general admission price. (Groupon did not offer any VIP discount options.)  VIP:  You get a goody bag, a festival tshirt, 2 raffle tickets (which you also get with regular admission), and there was supposed to be a VIP tent, but I never saw it.  (Inside the goody bag were coupons for free food and discounts off products, pins, food and vegan soap samples, and a veg*n magazine.  Definitely NOT worth $50. If I can't find another discount next year, I'll downgrade to general admission.)   ENTRY: The festival ran from 10am-6pm, rain or shine. I arrived @ 11:30am to a very long and slow moving entry line. There were no separate lines for VIP or prepaid customers (There should've been), so those of us with tickets were stuck in the same line with those who needed to purchase tickets.   After @ 1/2 hour of waiting, I was near the front and one of the workers yelled out asking if anyone had Groupon tickets. I moved towards her and she also accepted my Amazon ticket via my smartphone. But then she had to cross-reference it to a name list, and since I have a billion names (darn Latinas!) I was left waiting while they searched. At one point one of the organizers who was supposed to be helping me turned to me and was like, "May I help you?" She'd forgotten about me! Nonetheless, I was finally given my VIP wristband and guided where to go next.  Once inside, I picked up my VIP goody bag and tshirt at one table. Another table hosted the box for the raffle tickets. (Winners will be announced on their Facebook page.) From there you're free to explore at your leisure.   VENDORS: There were a handful of non-food vendors like Farm Sanctuary, The Humane Society, a college (forgot the name), and Herbivore Clothing (whose store is located in the Portland, Oregon vegan mini-mall).   Larger companies like Earth Balance, Beanfields, and Sweet Earth Natural Foods were offering up samples and coupons for their products.  Other's, like Rescue Chocolate didn't. I wanted to support their cause, but I needed to know which of their chocolate bars I'd like before shelling out $5 per bar.    b NAKED CHOCOLATES: Long lines from opening until closing. The owner is local and she allowed sampling of only one of her many flavors. However, it was a good base sample and I was able to choose the chocolates I wanted based on that and the descriptions of other options. 8 chocolates for $12.   EAT VEGAN FOOD: A food truck based out of Flagstaff, AZ. They offered juice and 3 food items.  The only one that appealed to me was the Tempeh Salad Wrap ($5).  They only charged $1 for bottled water. This was another long line. Roughly an hour wait, more for me because they tried to give me a Frito Pie. I didn't mind the wait. I did mind having wait another 1/2 hour or so before receiving my wrap. Wraps were coming out the wazoo for people who were in line after me.  I brought it to Sara's (co-owner) attention.  Sara, with her bubbly personality and people-person persona, was the saving grace for this one. It finally came. It was good. End of that story.   POMEGRANATE: They were basically just offering up yummy samples when I went.  I tried the Vegan Cowgirl cookies, which were delicious.  DESERT ROOTS KITCHEN: They offered several samples of their hummus, pudding, and a couple of other things.  Each item was also available for sale at this tent/booth.  Very nice and friendly employees here.   LULU'S SORBETTO: There was a nice selection of vegan fruit sorbets plus 1 non-fruit option, which was chocolate.  I got the Blood Orange Creamsicle. Yummy! 1 scoop for $4, 2 scoops for $5, and 3 scoops for $7.  UDUPI: This was THE longest line of them all. They were selling Gobi Manchurian and Dosas for only $5 each. I left and come back 2 hours later. The line had died down, but they were sold out of everything except onion and spicy chutney dosa.   MOUSTACHE PRETZELS: Runner up in the longest line contest. But OMG, SO worth the wait.  Best. Pretzels. Ever!  We got Original (salted pretzel for $3) and Salted Caramel (sans nuts for me), which was $4.  I can't even right now with the deliciousness involved...   Loved that the prices were not over-the-top for any of the vendors.   What I do not understand is how the 1st AZ Vegetarian Food Fest went down without some of the best vegan options in the valley, like Green New Vegetarian, Loving Hut, Bragg's, or Treehouse Bakery. I heard the hefty vendor fees were the culprit. Hopefully, next year the organization will rectify this. I'd like to see this event grow and succeed for the long haul.

Talk about feeling like a kid in a candy store! From the windows to the walls, this sweet-tooth mecca is chockfull of candies galore!   There are hundreds of different varieties of sweets ranging from classic, ole school candy to new age (Angry Birds & Candy Crush) creations.  Any flavor you can dream of, they likely have it. And for you bacon lovers (I'll try to hide my disdain), there's an entire section of bacon-flavored thangs (sic) just for you. There was also an entire section of Asian goodies, some of which I had only ever seen at a Japanese festival, so it's really cool that they carry them here. And the have the throwback water taffy too; barrels & barrels of taffy. The owner offered a free sample, but I declined. (I'm fairly certain that taffy is not vegan.)  On to the pop. Soda pop, that is. I am no expert, but this could very well be the largest selection of sodas in the city. Mind-blowing variety. (I saw a Snooki soda. No words! But...I wonder how it tastes?)  Some of the pop was refrigerated and some were on shelves. Some could be purchased individually, and some were sold as a 6, 12, or 24 pack.  If you're a pop connoisseur, you need to come here.  They also sell other novelty items like posters, pop culture standees (those life-sized cardboard replicas), magnets, games, toys, etc. And again, these range from classic (Marilyn Monroe & James Dean) to modern (The Walking Dead, The Hangover).    Some of the candy was over-priced, so don't buy your everyday candy here; but for the rare or hard to get flavors, it may be worth it.   It's a new (and fun!) store, located in the Thunderbird strip mall on the NW corner of N Scottsdale Rd & Thunderbird, behind the Taco Bell.  The female owner was very nice and welcoming. I'll definitely return for some sweetness!

It isn't quite summertime in Phoenix yet, but with temperatures already hitting the triple digits it certainly feels like it.  This is the time of year when I ditch the heavy, deep-fried everything for lighter meals, so it was the perfect time to finally give Flower Child a whirl.  I decided to get there a little early to beat any possible lunch crowd, as I'd read on Yelp that it can get very crowded. 10 minutes prior to opening and there were already a dozen people waiting. Wow. This is quite the popular place. The line moved quickly, and there were employees handing out samples of their Flower Girl Lemonade as we waited. Employees were also going through the line asking if patrons had any questions. Ok, ok. I'm starting to really like you folks.  Once I reached the counter I knew exactly what I wanted. I was given a number, I found a table, and had a seat.  Literally moments (felt like only seconds) later my food arrived at my table by a set of happy hands attached to a smiling face.   The Food. I basically got 3 sides, which came together in a large bowl.    RED CHILI GLAZED SWEET POTATO: If one more place makes an amazing sweet potato dish, I'll be forced to stop my incessant hating on this vegetable.  This dish was highly delectable. My eyes may or may not have rolled into the back of my head after first bite.  It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy, with neither flavor overpowering the other. Excellent flavor. Superb!  SAUTÉED SPINACH: I requested extra garlic and it was perfect.  No bland, rabbit leaves here.  Flavorful, lightly seasoned to perfection, and cooked just right, this dish is Popeye approved.  (These cooks should teach a certain "soul food" restaurant how to properly execute sautéed spinach.)   INDIAN SPICED CAULIFLOWER: I requested this dish without the dates and almonds but was told that it was mixed into whatever it was that was served with this dish. For me, this was fine. I am not allergic, I just prefer to avoid them if I can; they (nuts) annoy me for some odd reason. Anyway, I actually forgot that the nuts (dates and almonds) were even supposed to be in this dish until just now as I am writing about it.  I didn't see any.  I didn't taste any.  Either they CAN omit them, or they are so finely ground into the sauce or seasoning that they are undetectable to a non-allergic throat. (Hence, if you have a nut allergy, you shouldn't risk it.)  This dish was quite savory.  Personally, I could have used a stronger (hotter) spice, but the dish was still very good as is. Cauliflowers were not too raw, nor were they over-cooked. They were of a perfect softly crunchy texture, if that makes sense.     DESSERT: They have only one vegan dessert at this time. It's called STRAWBERRY YUZU CHEESECAKE. It's a raw vegan cheesecake topped with a strawberry glaze. Typically, I shy away from raw cuisine, but after reading a Yelp-friend's raving review of this dessert, I gave it a shot and WOWZA! It is truly delicious!  It's sweet, a little tart, and a very good emulation of a baked cheesecake.  I was very impressed. (Side note: Yuzu sounded Japanese so out of curiosity I looked it up. It's a citrus fruit.)  They could use more vegan dessert options, but I'm happy with the vegan raw cheesecake for now.   Basically, I love this place.  Not only was the food pretty amazing (and filling), but the service - friendly, smiling, helpful employees, were all just icing on the proverbial cake, and really made this a 5-star experience.  Vegan items are clearly marked with a yellow circle with a line through it.  The decor is lovely; very  hippie-like.  And dude, there is even a little resting place for your yoga mats!  I especially loved the positive little messages written on their window panes.  Unfortunately for me, great for them, is that apparently everyone else must love it too.  By 11:30am, it was already packed.  Parking lot went "from 0 to 100 real quick (real quick; real quick)."  Also, I noticed that once it began to get busy, the employees started passing out numbers and assigning tables (instead of you picking your own).  The kitchen and service staff seemed well-managed; everything was moving so smoothly.    Needless to say, I'll be back.  There is something about the name, Flower Child, that makes me happy.   Although I keep wanting to call it Sunflower, for some reason. Maybe because flowers grow in the sun? I don't know, but I do know that Flower Child has successfully mastered the art of executing flavorful, guilt-free food in a happy, healthy environment, and that is something that I can always support.  My name is Tigra, and I approve this message.

I stopped in for breakfast and was warmly greeted by an awesome employee. I wish I knew his name; he was a sweetheart.    I ordered the pancakes ($8), which are vegan and corn free. (They are made with rice flour.)  I got 3 slightly-larger-than-a-dollar-cake pancakes in this order and it came with no sides (unless you count the maple syrup). However, they were very filling.  They tasted a tab bit grainy, but not too earthy. They were still good, especially drowned in the pure maple syrup, just the way I like it.   I did order a side of Sweet Potato Hashbrowns ($3), ignoring my first mind.  You see, I am not a fan of the whole "sweet potato masquerading as an Idaho potato" trend. (Impostor!) But I was in the mood for some form of taters, so against my better judgement I ordered them and WOW! I don't know if it was the onions and red peppers, or the seasoning, or what, but this side dish was DELISH! I could not believe how good they were.    They do not offer a vegan bacon or faux meat breakfast option at this time. I'm thinking that there might not be an option for this that keeps with their 100% gluten-free, soy-free, and peanut-free practices.    The wait time was rather short, however, I was the only one there, so not sure what it's like later in the day.   They have several cold cases, one for salads, one for drinks, and one for desserts.  Most of the desserts appeared to be raw vegan. I grabbed some lemon bars and Cacao Mousse but have been too full to try them. I'll update once I've tasted those.  The pre-packaged items (salads and desserts) are all labeled so you can read the ingredients and weed out any allergens or dietary restrictions.  They have cold pressed juices and smoothies too, but I didn't try those.    This newly opened cafe is located inside of the SCNM Medical Center, off of Broadway, in Tempe, AZ. Drive to the back of the building and look for the Nourish signage. Parking is free in the parking lot and Nourish has its own entrance.  I'll have to go back another day to try their lunch menu. Healthy food that doesn't forego flavor.

It was my first time in a Sprouts so I didn't really know what to expect.  I soon felt like I was at Whole Foods' cousin's house.  I found lots of cool vegan goods at decent prices (cheaper than WFM for some, but not all things). Snagged some fresh fruit for the low low, and some salad toppings, whose prices here were even cheaper than Wally World.  There was a decent selection vegan brands like Gardein and So Delicious, etc. in the frozen section.   This store is large, clean, and well-stocked. The cashier was very nice as well. Cool store.

I visited this location on opening day, which was Thursday, 25Jun.  They were offering free MAD salads all day (10:30am-8pm).  The line was long, but they were well-organized and things moved rather quickly.    I got the Don Quixote salad. They were not allowing people to make any substitution really, but when I told them that I was vegan, they were very accomodating and allowed me to sub the meat for their Grilled Piri Piri Tofu, and instead of cheese I got green onions. I also switched dressings and got the Red Pepper Dressing instead of the non-vegan dressing that comes with it. I love the Red Pepper Dressing! Fresh baby greens, mangos, roasted corn, and avocado with MAD spice were all included in this salad, and it was SO good!   From someone who does NOT fancy tofu, the flavor for theirs is very impressive. I'm a fan!  DEAR VEGANS: There is a print out by the dressings which shows you which ones are vegan. Note: if it says "Vegan*" -WITH an asterisk sign, that means the dressing has honey. Pure vegan dressings will not have the asterisk. I suggest checking out their online interactive "allergen" menu; you can click everything that you want to omit and they'll produce a qualifying list of items. You can then click on each to see exactly what ingredients are used. FYI.   They also gave you a free drink with your free salad.  I typically do not drink soda, but I was intrigued by the organic fountain sodas they had. I tried the Vanilla Creme and it was quite sweet, yet tasty. I liked it. (Side note for ice connoisseurs, they have crushed ice!)  The salads range from $8-$10 for a regular and $9-$11 for a large, so it's a bit on the pricey side, but as long as they keep providing quality, fresh, and organic (the tofu is organic too) food, I don't mind shelling out a Hamilton every now and again for rabbit food.      This location is located in Tempe Marketplace, near the Harkins Theatre, next door to Cold Stone.

So... I totally "milked" the system.  I work near their Tempe location, but live near this Scottsdale location, so on Free Salad Day, 25Jun15, I went to 1 location for lunch, and for dinner I went to this location. It was after 7pm, but there was still a line wrapped around the corner.  There were water misters (my hair wasn't happy about that) blowing on the crowd to keep them cool and they also had flavored water dispensers to keep you hydrated in the heat.  Employees were nice, helpful, and the free-day was a well-organized event.   I ended up getting the same dish that I had at the other location, because I liked it so much. It was a veganized Don Quixote (and if ONE more person mispronounced his name in that line, I was gonna scream!): baby greens, Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu (instead of meat), roasted corn, avocado (with MAD spice), mango, green onions (instead of cheese), and the Roasted Red Pepper Dressing (instead of the non-vegan creamy "something" that came with it).   I ended up saving it for lunch the next day, and I agree with the other Yelper about the wilting greens.  It was definitely soupy the next day, but it had been swimming in dressing (plus, I requested a lot of dressing) 16 hours so I won't complain.  Everything was still tasty the next day, and the avocados were still green (you know an avocado will turn on you quickly).    VEGANS: For protein options, they have...  1 - Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu - These are chunks of firm tofu (with a slight squish factor), but the taste is excellent (and I am no tofu fan). I was told that they marinate their organic tofu for 24 hours; this is what gives it such great flavor.  2 - Grilled Portobellos (if mushrooms are your thang).  3 - Warm Quinoa.  There are lots of fruits, veggies, and nuts as well.   Avoid the Paninis! The bread is not vegan (their sourdough bread contains whey).  VEGAN SALAD DRESSINGS - There is a print out by the dressings which shows you which ones are vegan. Note: if it says "Vegan*" -WITH an asterisk sign, that means the dressing has honey. Pure vegan dressings will not have the asterisk. I suggest checking out their online interactive "allergen" menu; you can click everything that you want to omit and they'll produce a qualifying list of items. You can then click on each to see exactly what ingredients are used. Know before you go! (The Balsamic Vinaigrette, Sherry Molasses Vinaigrette, and Roasted Red Pepper are among the pure vegan options.)  Lastly, keep your eyes on your bowl as they add ingredients.  I told the guy at the cash register that I was vegan so I'd be swapping non-vegan items for vegan items in my salad.  I watched the girl and as soon as I saw her go for the cheese I started waving my hands profusely and saying, "No, no NO!" Too late. Cheese in the bowl.  "I told him vegan..." I said with a sad face. She was like, "No worries." She tossed that bowl, told cashier-guy what he should add to the ticket for vegans, then she got me a brand new bowl and re-made my salad.  No attitude. No bother.  THAT was refreshing.   I don't always want to eat a salad, but when I do, I'll think of MAD Greens!

The ever popular Simon's Hot Dogs, originally located in Sedona, has finally relocated and opened in Scottsdale, AZ. The location may have changed, but the hot dogs that we love remain delicious.   They still offer vegan and vegetarian hot dog options. Don't worry carnivores, they have hot dogs for you too. I got the Colombian, vegan style, which is a vegan hot dog topped with pineapples, crushed potato chips, Simon's sauce, and vegan shredded cheese (the latter of which I omitted). The combination may sound strange but once you've tried it you'll be a fan! The buns are different (I think they had to change hot dog bun vendors after the relocation), but they're still good, just not as soft as the original buns.   The menu has expanded too. Vegan ceviche and vegan salcipapas will be offered! (Note that some things may not be available during the soft opening.) They offer a combo; you can add crispy french fries and a drink for just $3 more.   Prices remain reasonable and the owners are complete sweethearts. You'll feel like family here.    The new location is nestled in Old Town Scottsdale, next door to the Hyatt Place hotel. As of Thursday, 03Dec, they are in a soft opening status from 11am-8pm, everyday except Sunday (although they will close at 5pm on Friday, 04Dec, for a special event), as they train their staff. The grand opening will be Saturday, 12Dec, starting at 11am.

My prior issues with service were addressed and the meal was refunded. I have since returned, but for carry-out. I got the potato tacos again (my fav dish so far) with a side of french fries (not on the menu, but available for $3). I love their fresh cut fries. I just wish they'd offer more vegan desserts (cakes, cupcakes).  I still need to try their breakfast items.

I don't just give out 5-star reviews all willy-nilly. But when the product + service + experience is on fleek, I must give credit where credit is due.   We were Homecoming shopping and saw a sign advertising $10 eyebrow threading. I decided to allow DD to shape her brows for the first time so we gave them a go.   The lady doing the threading was toiling away at another customer's brows, but she still made an effort to acknowledge us and offer a friendly smile. Once it was DD's turn, the lady was so nice. She allowed me to take photos and even beckoned for me to come over and take a before & after brow shot. She does the threading in front of a large glass window in the front of the store, which is smart business. By the time DD was done (about 10 minutes or less) there was a line of women waiting.   Aside from the threading, they have a massive selection of Indian garb, jewelry, art, and home decor. They had some super cute women's outfits. DD even considered one of their dresses for the Homecoming dance.   A male employee (presumably the owner) was also very nice and personable. He said that they offer belly dancing classes on Saturdays, and will soon offer yoga, Bollywood, voice, piano, etc. classes.   There is a lot going on here, but the store is large and spacious, so they can pull it off. I'll def go back to try some of the classes.   They're located near the Dillard's side of the mall, across from Victoria's Secret.

I initially learned of this festival through a Groupon deal and I checked to see if they'd have any veg*n options. The Spicy Veggie truck was supposed to be there so I was excited to try it. However, I ended up volunteering to take part in the Yelp judging (not an official Yelp event) instead of purchasing the Groupon, and I couldn't be happier. If I had spent one red cent on this event, I'd be uber ticked.   About a week prior to the event I received a call from someone confirming my spot as a Yelp Elite judge. I was told to arrive by 11am to check-in. When I arrived I expected to see some sort of designated check-in area for judges. I went to the area where they were selling event tickets, but no one knew anything about the Yelp judges or where to go. I wandered around aimlessly until I ran into someone who guided me to a building. Inside that building I was informed that I could sign in there (I had to sign a waiver via iPad), but then I'd have to walk to the amphitheater for the Yelp judge meet-up. So I walked over there and I saw what looked like a group of friends hanging out. I looked closer and saw two familiar Yelpers, so I figured I was in the right place. There was no signage from the event indicating that this was the meeting area. If I didn't know anyone, I would've kept walking around, looking for the group.   After about an hour of waiting, we were finally given some instructions. We were given 10 sample tickets for use at booths which were participating in the challenge (Not all booths were.) and one or 2 (I don't recall) drink tickets, although we were promised more (which we eventually received a couple of hours later). We were forewarned that some of the vendors might be meanies, due to stress and whatnot. Yay. (Sarcasm) We were instructed to jump to the front of the lines, announce ourselves as Yelp Elite judges, and demand our samples or else (basically). Oh, that sounds fun. (Not.) We were told to get the samples and go back to the meeting area to be interviewed.  As we walked around, looking at the various food booths and food trucks, we noticed that less than 1/2 the advertised vendors were present, the Spicy Veggie truck was amongst the M.I.A. Therefore, I was limited in what I could sample. LuLu's Sorbet is always a winner. There was a sample tent which had vegetarian egg rolls, fried green beans, potato cakes, and apple churros. This was the most veggie-friendly option out of all the vendors, and I'm pretty sure this tent was owned by the event organizers.  I really wanted french fries from one vendor but the line was long and mean with eye-daggers waiting to gouge out your sockets if you tried to jump them.  Yelp-schmelp. Without any distinctive credentials to set you apart, you were basically just a rude @$$hole trying to cut the line. No bueno. Oh, and let's not forget the soft-serve and coffee food truck owner who was rude to us, or the many vendors who started the day saying they were out of samples. Fibbers. *sigh*  After the stress of finding and getting at least a couple of samples, we remembered that we needed to high-tail it back over to the meeting area for an interview. There was a lot of back and forth. I was partially dehydrated by now and everyone was out of water. When the water finally arrived it was warm.   After having enough with the lines, we decided to throw in the towel on the judging. We made our choices and took our ballots to the building. While there, we were given the rest of our drink tickets. I inquired about the wristbands we were supposed to have and we were given VIP wristbands. Come to find out, everyone and their mamas had these wristbands. That, coupled with the fact that even though there were signs indicating there should be separate lines for people with sample tickets, express, etc., there were no separate lines, so you just had to wait with everyone else. If I had paid for a VIP wristband, I would've raised all levels of hell, but I didn't, so...  I did enjoy the samba dancers in their traditional wardrobe. I also had a delicious sno-cone at the cart across from the Panini truck; wish I remembered the name of that business. They let me get a large sno-cone using my drink tickets, which sent me off on a happy note. And I made some cool friends.  I walked away having spent $0 for this event, but I cannot give it 3 stars because it was not OK. If there had been a smidgen of organization to this event, it could've gone so much better. Someone with the event should have either been at the booths to assist the judges, or with the judges as they went around to the booths. Maybe even specific times for judging at each booth would've been helpful for both the vendors and judges. I'm not a fan of having food already sitting at a table for judges because I'm OCD, for one, and secondly, that's a sure way to waste food, as not everyone eats every thing.  I'm sure they'll learn from this year's mishaps, and maybe next year will be loads better.

We have a shiny, brand new CVS in the hood! Coming from the Midwest, I was always a Walgreens girl and never saw a CVS unless I was visiting family on the east coast. Since moving to PHX, I've noticed an equality of sorts when it comes to the presence of both brands, so I tend to teeter between the two, based on convenience.   This location opened on Sunday, 08Nov15, and the store is open 24/7, which is awesome because everything in this area closes super early. Now we have somewhere close to go for those late night *insert what you need* runs.   Of course the store is neat and clean, being that it's still in newborn status. They have some cool things too, like large Darth Vaders (see photo), HUGE stuffed Minnie & Mickey Mouse (mice?), and all sorts of Peanuts swag. I will be returning to snag all things Snoopy.   There's a photo center in the front of the store. The pharmacy is in the back. They have a drive-thru as well (...for the pharmacy. Don't pull up trying to get snacks and drank.).  Some of the prices on some things were too high, as is typical for drugstores. However, I saw 20% off tags throughout the store, for your money-saving pleasure, and don't forget to sign up for their rewards program to continue the savings every time you shop.   Employees were nice and friendly. We were double-greeted when we entered.   It's located off of Bell Rd, right before it turns into FLW (at N Scottsdale Rd). It's where the old Carlos O'briens used to be.   Welcome to the neighborhood, CVS!

The newest Loving Hut has opened in Tempe, AZ, and the world is smiling. If you're not familiar with Loving Hut, they are the largest vegan restaurant chain in the world. This location is brought to you by the owners of the Glendale LH location.   I went for their grand opening party on Saturday, 21Nov15, which they sweetly dubbed a "Welcoming & Appreciation" Party. From 11am-9pm, they served only a special menu, which consisted of Golden Rolls, Rainbow Salad, Golden Beauty, Kung Pao, Save the Planet Curry, and your choice of Lemongrass, Jasmine, or Hibuscus tea all for only $7.95! This idea is ingenious. Kudos to whomever came up with this. It allowed newbies to try several different dishes, and gave me a chance to go outside of my normal go-to dishes. It was a LOT of food and it came out fast and delicious. 'Twas a very successful and well-organized soft opening.   The employees were all extremely nice. I felt like family; it made my soul smile.   How can you not love Loving Hut? Not only are they 100% vegan, but they are passionately committed to saving the planet (Eco-friendly containers) as well as animals, and they are always sweet and kind. It truly is a Loving Hut. Peace and love, y'all!

How awesome is it that I've had this place bookmarked for over a year and then it ends up being a YEE host venue?! Needless to say, I was super-siked for this one.   The food was served family style and it was a'plenty! As a vegan, I'll focus on the vegan dishes. Crispy Chili Baby Corn, Veggie Yellow Thai Curry, & Veggie Hakka Noodles. I LOVED the spices and flavors in these dishes from the orient. All 3 were delish!     There were also drink samples of both juices and "drank." (You know what THAT means!) I sampled the Lychee juice. It contained real fruit pieces. It was light and refreshing.   The restaurant is roomy with a welcoming Asian decor.   Everyone, from the servers to my fellow Elites, was awesome tonight. I had a fabulous time! Thanks Hailey!!
