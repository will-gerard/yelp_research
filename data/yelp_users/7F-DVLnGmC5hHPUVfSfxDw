I attended Mas here last Sunday and so happy I did! Sunday before last, I was dragged to Mass at The Franciscan Renewal Center and it was not joy. It was far too Liberal -- it's simply not my preference as a Catholic.  Walking towards the Cathedral, you just feel a sense of history -- it's simply beautiful. I adore so many Patron Saints so I love all the decorated alters. Choir is simply amazing! Times keep changing...but I prefer to celebrate Catholic Mass in a more traditional manor. I attend St. Francis Xavier and Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church on a regular basis but will definitely attend Mass here more often.

I've been a fan and lover of the Paisley Violin for almost 4 years. Love this charming little place nestled on Grand Ave. It's out of the way but yet it has a downtown feel. Gina, owner and cook, makes the best hummus in town. I had one of the best Hummus pizza specials ever prepared by Gina. Since then, every time I return to PV, Gina always makes a special pizza filled with the ingredients that I love. Best cafe mochas in town! If ever I do take in First Friday, this is usually our last stop of that night. It's perfect for gatherings with friends. Check out their websites for daily specials.

I always enjoy days when I work downtown with clients because there are so many choices for Lunch. I love the Duck & Decanter on Camelback so decided to give the downtown location a try. Before I reached the door entrance, I could smell the baked goodness coming from within. Staff was friendly and efficient. My Chicken sandwich was yummy and coffee was delish. Gotta love & support worthy local businesses!

I can't get enough of our Phoenix Symphony. As a Classical music lover, I've always been hypnotized by the Sounds of the Strings. I played French Horn in High School and at University and the piercing bold brass of the Horns gets me every time.  One of my favorite pieces is 'Scheherazade' by Rimsky-Korsakov. I love this music as performed by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. I can listen to this piece over and over. When our Phoenix scheduled a performance to include this masterpiece, I knew I had to be in attendance. I really didn't think that they could pull this off in a grand style. Wow...was I completely wrong. I have never heard our Symphony shine as bright as they did that night.  I will forever be a Classical music fan and thrilled to say that I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Symphony. Cheers***

Love this place. Great service. Huge portions. Love that I never have to ask for a refills on drinks. Every dish I've ever had at this great place has been delish.  I'm hooked. We go here at least once a month. Faves: Lemon chicken & Mongolian beef. Dang...it's almost 10pm and now I'm craving China Chili!!!!

As a member of the Catholic and Greek Orthodox Faith, I'm proud to be a member of St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. I attend Mass here every other Sunday and often attend a mid week morning Mass. I love the traditions of the Church and always feel at ease here. Christmas Midnight Mass is a true joy -- Love the festive Christmas Holiday decor of our Church.   As a gay man, I'm often ridiculed for my deep Catholic faith. My faith and beliefs are those of my own and between God and myself...and I'm thankful to share spiritual moments at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church.

I would never have stopped in or tried this Pizzeria if it hadn't been for a Living Social offer. I'm happy I purchased the offer after our first try. Pizza and wings were amazing. Second time around wasn't quite as impressive as the first. The joint has a private party out on the front patio and the service inside of the restaurant suffered a bit. Various tables remained dirty for quite some time. Our pizza didn't have quite as much sauce and not enough Pepperoni. Overall, I love the feel of this place and hope the second trip was just a fluke. PS...Their Wings are the Bomb!!! :) Cheers***

I run past my Church when I run along the Canal so I thought I should review this beautiful place of worship. As a member of the Catholic and Greek Orthodox Faith, I'm very proud to attend Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral. I always feel such a spiritual connection as soon I walk in. The greeters always make me feel at home with their welcome smiles. This Church by far has the best Members/Congregation.   Xristos Anesti celebrations always bring me to the verge of joyous tears so if you're a person of Faith and want to try something different, I highly recommend their Easter Celebration services.

I have always enjoyed dinner with friends at Phoenix City Grille. I had never tried Happy Hour there so a friend and I decided to give it a try. We sat for almost 10 minute at bar before we were asked if we'd like a drink. The Green Chile Queso Fundido was quite tasty. We intended to order a few other items but We had to pry the bartenders to return for refills and food that we decided to leave and continue Happy Hour elsewhere. Keep you posted on our return to PCG...

I was a customer of Runner's Den long before I actually took up running. Yes, it's true. I bought a few pair of shoes because of my casual running back then and then I gained 'CHINGOS' of weight and didn't run for years. When I decided to take up running in 2010, It wasn't for the sake of becoming a runner but to reach my goal of being a Size 6 again. I decided to try a national chain running store in Tempe and was happy for the most part. Once I began to have issues with my feet during training, it became frustrating to hear various differ responses for people at the store. After much consideration, I decided to return to Runner's Den. I usually ask for the dashing handsome fast running salesperson, Jim (---that's worthy of some small discount, no?).   Since buying a few shoes and various items, I've Jim suggested I try out their group runs on Wednesday evenings. I'm not a fast runner but this group is rather kewl. The store is so much closer to home and I feel as though I actually matter as a customer than just another sale. Runner's Den is my running store again! Cheers***

I'd hate to waste a star on this place!  I lived right outside of The French Quarter in New Orleans for 8 months. I remember the best of Cajun food and this place was far from what I remember. I'm not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree.  What did I order? I ordered a simple Chicken Po'boy sandwich. How can a Cajun restaurant get this wrong? This place did. The chicken was placed on bread that was hard. I expected the chicken to be smothered in BBQ sauce. Wrong! The sauce was on the side. The lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side. The fries were cold. Yuck!  Waitress was great. She was the best part of this dining experience. Never again.

This will be quick and simple. I just went to Taylor's Cafe to purchase a gift certificate and server informed me that only a manager could  complete the transaction. That's a huge big time FAIL! Thank you for that  waste of time.

This is the only Watch Repair company I use. Most of the time it's to have the batteries changed or to remove links from a new watch. Quick and Easy. Cash & Carry but I usually seem to forget. By the time I return from the ATM, my watches are ready! Highly recommend this place. Cheers***

Love going to The Candy Store with my Buds. Keep in mind I'm in no way an expert at T&A --- but even I recognized beautiful women when I see 'em! This place has improved over the years and far as female dancers go.  $7 lap dances? Uhhh...one lap dance long ago was enough for me --  barking up the wrong side of the tree here --- but it was great fun. Girls can jam and do some kewl tricks.  Now...I do know about their great Turkey and Top Sirloin Burgers. We often hit this place up for their great specials on Saturdays afternoons. Perfect spot to watch footballs games on the weekends. So overall, I kewl straight buds put up with many of my suggestions for our many of our outings so going to this spot every now and then isn't so bad. Sometimes being a fly on the wall can be fun! :)

I used to attend Mass at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church on a regular basis years ago. Yesterday, I felt it was time to return for early Sunday Mass and so happy I did. During the week, I often stop, pray & meditate in the St. Katherine Drexel Chapel - I find it to be very cathartic. Although I'm a member at another Catholic Church, I plan to attend Mass more often here at St. Joan of Arc.

One of my oldest and dearest friends is in town visiting his family and called me at 2:30am asking if I wanted to meet up for a cup of coffee & conversation. I suggested this Waffle House. As always, the coffee was hot, delicious & fresh. We shared a breakfast wrap, eggs and waffles. Server was awesome and the food arrived quickly -- food was yuumilious. I can always count on Waffle House to be there for me when I'm in need of comfort foods and sharing times with good friends. Thanks, Waffle House!

I had never heard of Tam's until one of my best friends kept talking about this fabulous little hole in the wall of a place. I'm glad she did. Better yet, I'm happy she decided to pick up some Tam's and head over to my place for dinner.  I gotta admit that Mona is right about Tam's serving up the 'best blackenese chinese soul food' in town. For real****  Best chicken wings. I love their egg foo young w/chicken gravy! Yummers. I will definitely keep this place in mind for the future. I've yet to actually pick up an order from this place but if it tastes just like what I had when Mona brought a bit of Tam's to our house, then it's definitely worth the drive. Five Stars, Baby!

I love this little spot in Scottsdale. For the past few years, we've been catching 'It's A Wonderful Life' on Christmas Eve. Service was the same as always - great. Waiters were always on top of things. After the movie, we enjoyed drinks by the lounge. It was nice to enjoy this with a group of new friends and each left amazed at this experience. We'll definitely have to return more often. Cheers!

I have complete Faith in this Firestone location. I've dealt with this location for years with all three of our cars. I had to be away for months due to family and one of the cars needed special attention. Rachel was a great help to me this past time. The AC job was a bit and she asked if I could go in to a local Firestone location and have a rep from that location call Phoenix location to assist with payment... all to protect me from fraudulent charges.  Thanks Rachel for all your help and thanks to the whole staff for great service. Cheers***

I've passed by Grimaldi's Pizzeria almost day in an day out and ever realized I was passing a fabulous Pizzeria!  Good friend, Yvonne, mentioned that we should consider dinner after our group run so that she could use her Birthday discount. To be honest, I wasn't really in the mood at that moment for Pizza but rather Chicken Wings.  We arrive to the Pizzeria and upon viewing the menu, I realized that there are no WIngs on the Menu. Yep, I was bummed. We ordered a Pizza and Salad. Ok, the small salad was enough for the both of us. Then out HUGE PIZZA arrived. Oh my... for someone that wasn't in the mood for pizza, I shure ate and ate and ate! After this experience, I completely get it. Grimaldi's is all about the Pizza experience.   Another great restaurant to add to my Collection of Fave spots!  Cheers***

I love the grounds that surround the Franciscan Renewal Center.  I've attended Mass here a few times and believe the services are a bit too Liberal for my taste. I prefer more traditional Masses.   I  do love the St Francis Festival Adoptathon/Blessing of the Animals annual tradition. It's an event I attend each year. Differ tastes for differ Catholics...

Friend suggested we head to Barrio Cafe for Happy Hour...and we did just that. We ordered a few items off of the Happy Hour menu and enjoyed a few drinks. We pretty much had the dining room area to ourselves. Tasty. No complications just a great time. Barrio Cafe never disappoints. For all those that have had bad experiences here, I hope I never go to BC with you...I'd hate for you to jinx my meal! Cheers***

I'm old. Yes, just a look at my T&A and you'd think I was a young and fresh Bunny, but sadly the few wrinkles on my face and grey hairs say other wise. Anyway, I remember the first CD I ever bought was Sheena Easton's first and self titled CD. I was so excited that I played that CD over and over. I still feel the same way when I purchase a CD. More so when I purchase a CD at a record store and at a bargain.   I love to browse around and listen to the staff's current faves and the recommended new artists at the music listening stations. I have a huge shelves and shelves of CDs and i still get excited when I add another CD to the collection. Support Indie record stores...and old people like myself that prefer old fashion record stores. Cheers***

Love this place. Met up with a good friend for Happy Hour here. I actually enjoy coming here by myself from time to time and people watch from the bar. There's always somethin' on their wine list to accommodate Love their pizzas and salads. A restaurant that knows how to tease me properly with Nutella as an ingredient will always receive high praise from me! Decor and setting is perfect for friends and family -- If wear permits and is ideal, I highly recommend dining out on their patio. Can't say anything negative about this place.

If I could sue Carly's Bistro for the waste of my money and time, I would. Food isn't all that and service was slow. Do they even cook anything? I ordered the Santa Fe Sandwich. I asked about a substitution and the waitress rolled her eyes. Ugh. Never again. So many other great local restaurants and choices...I'll never head back to Carly's.

Enjoyed Happy Hour with friends last night and I had a fabulous time. I ordered one of my regular appetizers -- Trio of dipping sauces -- good stuff. I was in the mood for coffee and was told that a new pot of coffee was brewing at that moment. Coffee was yummy. Great service --- that alone is priceless. Thank you to the Staff at Ticoz. Cheers***

After a 5 mile run this evening, good friend and running partner, Yvonne, decide we were worthy of a little festive snack. We decided to stop in and order a Fallen Angel pizza. Pizza was perfect! Scoops of Caramel and Butter Pecan Gelato was just the only way to end a great evening. Waitress and service were awesome as always. This is a perfect restaurant for lunch, dinner, dessert, or just a kewl spot to meet a friend for coffee and conversation.LGO...Love it! Cheers***

Rodan and I took one of our best friends out for their birthday last night and we all had a great dining experience. We've been coming to this little Italian restaurant for a few years and food and service continue to be 5 star worthy.   Love the soft bread that is served early on. Our friend ordered the Seafood Fradiavolo and thought it was one of the best seafood entrees she ever had. This was actually her first visit. I stuck with my fave: the potato pizza. Yum! I ordered the medium pizza and happy that half of the pizza was brought home as leftovers. Save room for a dessert...you won't be disappointed!  This is by far my  fave Italian restaurant in Phoenix. Cheers!

I don't dine at this particular Valle Luna enough because of it's location -- it's far North from where I live. My best friend lives in the area and decided to treat her here since she had never been. She and I were not disappointed. I'm all about the dips and chips. She had one of their more popular entrees and loved it. Their desserts are just as incredible. Service continues to be exceptional. I'll have to venture here more often. It may be an older restaurant but it's still one of the best places for Mexican food here in the Valley. Cheers***

Let's keep this simple. I purchased a LivingSocial voucher. The intention was to invite my best friend, Tamra. I waited until that last day to use it and Tamra couldn't make it. So I decided to head to Amano Pizza Bistro on my own. It was busy but luckily for me, I took the seat by the corner wall at the bar. Ordered a glass of Malbec and took in the atmosphere until it was time to place my order.   Salad was delish and the Italian Sausage pizza was amazing. I also ordered pasta (like that last thing I need is more food!) -- delish as well. The restaurant was completely busy and staff were kept on their toes --- yet I received such great service and attention. First time here but it won't be the last. I look forward to my next visit. Cheers***

This gym has everything I need...if only I could step it up so that I actually see results! Great price, no contracts. Love the new open area. The Jacob's Ladder and the Stair Stepper tried to kill me -- but it's all good. Both are perfect for my marathon training. Love that I can run a few miles along the canal nearby before I do core. There is a Tanning section as well...I've spotted a few 'Magda' looking creatures from 'Something About Mary'...not a pretty sight. Thank God I naturally have a beautiful year 'round tan. Amen!

Well? How deep is the well? Not shure but I'll be happy to share another update about this gym. I've mentioned that I'm very happy with my boot camp style gym but now that I'm training for my first full marathon, it's way too hot for me to complete long runs. If I don't manage to get out and start at a certain time in the mornings, it won't happen.  So today, I went in to Tangible to start up again. Zumba classes are now offered at no cost to members -- I'll be willing to shake my g'donk g'donk and give it a try. For $25 a month and no contracts, this little gym is perfectly located not far from where I live and I could get back into upper chest work in the weight room. I love that the Owner, Chris, doesn't run this place like a typical big name gym. Overall, I'm happy to be back. Cheers***  PS...If only there was an easier way to maintain my Size 4 figure...

The views of Sanctuary Resort & Spa are amazing -- I always feel special here.   I'm a Wine guy...but a client suggested I try their Mojito. I'm glad he made the recommendation because it was by far the best Mojito I've enjoyed. Chips, Wings, sharing of a Burger and fries were all delish!  Good company, good wine, great appetizers to match the atmosphere & ambiance - all combined made for a great experience. I can't wait to return with my Partner and good friends for an enjoyable Happy Hour. Cheers***

Love this place for the ambiance.  I would usually go alone after a long day's work...then I felt guilty for not sharing this place with others. Service has been outstanding each and every time...main reason why I return. Okay, the other reason is the great choices on the wine list. I'm surprised I'm not a grandchild of Betty Ford! I look forward to enjoying this place with friends on a Thursday evening.

Pure freshness. I loved most that the service was excellent. This is definitely one of my fave burger joints. *CHEERS*

It feels as though I've been running for ages but I just took up running again at the end of 2010. I finally participated in various running events throughout 2011. I live a block from the PF Chang's RnR Full Marathon route. For so many years, I would walk a block with my morning robe & chanclas with coffee in hand and cheer on the runners. I've always wanted to be a part of this event so I'm thrilled I did just that. I ran the half mary. I took the light rail from Camelback and Central down to Tempe - piece of cake. Cake? Yum. Part of the reason I ran this race was because of the new course - I really liked. Finish Line was filled with excitement.   Congrats to all those that helped put this event together. Volunteers and fans/suppoerters were awesome. This race is now in my Bucket List. The 2013 race will be the day after the Temecula Valley Half Marathon so I'll have to miss this race next year. Where there is wine...there goes Xavier! Cheers***

Back in 2008, good friend and Singer/Songwriter, Laura Marie along with her husband came to Phoenix to run this event's full marathon. I remember cheering them on from the same spot as I have for all the years except for last year when I decided to run the half marathon.  Laura Marie and her husband stayed with us and it was exciting to see how runners prepare for a race. Their enthusiasm and commitment was the spark that I needed to consider taking up running and finally losing weight.  This year, I was proud to stand and cheer on good friends, friends/mentors from running groups and brave souls running the full marathon. Every year it's just as exciting! After the runners passed, I walked block away back to my house and got ready to take the light rail down to Tempe.  Watching people cross the Finish Line is the best part!!! It's such a joy to see those that completed their first race and/or set a PR. I was set to run the Temecula Valley Half Marathon the day before this race but was canceled. All and all, I'm somewhat happy that it happened this way. If I hadn't, I would have missed out on great personal moments as friends crossed the Finish Line.   Taking Light Rail to and from Tempe was easy. Congestion filled with Runners & their medals on Mill Ave was awesome! As with any race, I still get the jitters before a race and always thankful and blessed to cross the Finish Line. This past weekend, I felt those same jitters for all the runners that ran. I've completed so many half marathons these past two years that maybe it's time to actually run this full marathon. The thought of passing my usual spot without me standing there would be such a great moment!   Thanks again PF Chang & RnR Series. Volunteers were awesome as always. Congrats to all those the Runners! Cheers***

Friends from NYC came into town and wanted to try Teharu Sushi. First off, I HATE sushi...but that's okay. I figured they'd have other items on the menu. We were seated and our waiter took forever. Finally I'm ready to order and was informed that Egg rolls are no longer available but are listed on the menu since he started working over a year ago. No Egg rolls? Dang Yo! We just chilled and enjoyed a great conversation and waited to eat somewhere else. I hope to never see this place again.

This place gets better and better with each visit. For the most part, a group of us head down often for the Wingless Buffalo Dip and drinks, & fabulous conversation. We vowed that we would get together more often in 2010...and this has become one of our fave hangouts. Love Tina at the bar! Perfect atmosphere. Happy that Maizie's Cafe has become one of our fave spots. Cheers!

Big Time Stuff! Love this place. I really love this place. Dinner wasn't too bad but it didn't shine -- service was a bit slow and I felt as though I had to wait forever for Braised Chicken entree. Dinner was delish and I actually loved the Garlic Spinach!  5th Star is for their fabulous Happy Hour! I love the menu - Wings, Baby, Wings! The Singh Farm Honey Wings are delish as well as the Pretzel Bite Fondue with Cheese Sauce. I believe the Schreiner's Bacon Wrapped Dates are just as yummy but can't seem to remember since they're gonna in minutes from time the server places the dish on the table. OK, they're just as yummy as everything on the HH menu.  I also love that the bar area fills up for Happy Hour - makes for a festive afternoon environment. It makes for a perfect reason to enjoy Happy Hour in downtown Phoenix and maybe a movie at Arizona Center right across the street. Did I mention their WINGS!!!!! Cheers***

Ack! Since our last visit, Happy Hour menu changed and presentation of various HH items have changed. We weren't happy. Dates are no longer wrapped in bacon but rather a few pieces of bacon bits on top of Dates.  The Pretzel Bite Fondue was odd. The bread had that Pretzel taste. This time around it was strips of hard bread and the fondue was served in a tiny tiny bowl. Chicken wings were tiny! Dang...I'm bummed. I really wanted this place to be a Happy Hour Fave. Bum boo bum...

After late morning and afternoon venturing through downtown Phoenix, Joy and I decided to stop in for Happy Hour. We were really pleased with the food and service.  So happy that the Honey Dipped Drumsticks were on the Bar list! We shared the Drumsticks, Lemon Spiked Black Bean Hummus & the Pretzel Bits Fondue. I am so happy that we had a great experience because I so want to love this place.  Yes, they've earned their Stars back. Cheers***

On the way home from work yesterday, a friend wanted to meet up at America's Taco Shop for a snack & catch up conversation and chisme -- You know me, I'm all about good tacos & chisme!   I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito -- delicious & full of flavors. Somethin' about the recipe they use for the carne asada alone makes it special. I look forward to returning -- now that it's cooler, outdoor seating will be ideal. Cheers***

First and only time I had been to The Mission was for drinks at a social mixer before the group headed to another venue for dinner -- that was back in 2009. When two of my closest Chicas suggested we head here for Happy Hour, I was excited!  I was seated at the Bar and enjoyed an Iced Tea before the girls arrived. As soon as they arrived, we were seated. We were in good hands with Kristin, our Server. Appetizers were delish! I loved their Spicy Chicken Wings! Chicken Tacos were perfect! This would be ideal to bring my Partner for a nice dinner -- he would love this place.  Good friends, fabulous conversation & great food & service...Five Stars, Baby!!!  CHEERS***

At first, I kept away from this place because my lasting Love for Katz Deli wouldn't allow me to give this place a try from it's early get go. A friend of mine invited me to join Happy Hour with friends on a week day and I fell in love. Love their $5 glasses of wine and Pitchers of Beer from Open to 5pm Seven Days a Week!   Ro and I usually order the Select Two /$10.50 with 2 choices: Half of any Panini, Side Salad of Choice or Soup of The Moment. Postino's Central has become one of our fave date night restaurants. Oh...give the Cheese Board a try...YUMMERS! Can't go wrong with this place. Cheers***

I love this place! I'm actually a regular here. Often, friends and myself stop in after an evening workout at the gym. Great Happy Hour menu. The Buffalo Chicken Sliders and Spinach & Artichoke Dip are my faves. If you're all about Burgers, I highly recommend this place. Cheers***

From the moment I walk in to The Parlor, my love affair with this place begins. Love the atmosphere & decor.   A good friend and myself decided to stop in this evening for a lite dinner. This evening we enjoyed the Summer Corn Pizza and Heirloom Tomato Salads and made sure to save room for a shared dessert. Another great evening with a great friend & memorable conversation. Cheers***

I bitch every time I head for a work out at Amenzone Primal Fitness Training but I'm always thankful for the results I see & feel. I never heard of this place until I read Dallas G's review. I thought if I could work out at this place, maybe a bit of Dallas' smokin' hot looks may just rub off on me. Ha!   Amen is charismatic & knows exactly how to motivate you. When I'm working out with a class of 25-35 folks, I don't feel as though I'm in competition with the other attendees. I feel I am in competition with myself to do the very best during that one hour. Amen brings that primal instincts within myself. So thank you Dallas for the inspiration. Thank you Amen for making me want to see & feel a better version of myself.   First class is free. So if you're ready to to push yourself through primal fitness, head to http://www.amenzone.net/ and check it out. Cheers! PS...I've lost a total of 16 pounds & feelin' so much better about myself. :)

I have returned for a few workouts here and there. I love Amen and his Crew. I recently attended a Boxing class led by Tommy -- amazing class. Only thing that keeps me away is the distance. I attend another Boot Camp style gym but it's just not the same. Every time I go to class at the other gym I feel as though I'm settling and I HATE this feeling. Looking forward to the new AmenZone that will be located Metro Phoenix area. Amen & his crew are the best. Cheers***

A friend that lives in the Downtown area wanted to meet here for coffee & chat. It's one of his fave spots. He reminded me over and over, "It's very hipster!"  Uhhh...Yeah, OK. Coffee was blah. Staff weren't all that friendly. Comfy chairs = Yes..but there's no reason to return.

How could I forgot exactly how much I love Lola Coffee. I remember this coffee house to meet a friend that lived in the area not long after it opened. So yesterday's visit after work was a joy. I enjoyed a nice cup of coffee in a mug and loved every drop. This was the perfect place to unwind after work rather than the usual Starbucks -- so happy I decided to mix things up and try somethin' different. I'll have to make it a point to try breakfast here. Cheers***

Chapter 2 ---- After I made the decision to try another  Physical Therapy location, I went with a location that was nearby. I had my initial appointment with Mark Moore. I love that Mark actually listens and and answered all of my questions. I kid you not -- this man has the BEST hands!!!! He worked on my Left heel injury as best as he could but I needed a PT that was certified in ASTYM™. I highly recommend Mark and the staff at this location.  Roxanne works the front desk but is also a Personal Trainer --- she knows her stuff.  Due to insurance guidelines, I preferred to stay with the same PT company so decided to try the Mesa location since Janeen Delgenio is certified. If it weren't for that one little hiccup, I would have continued therapy with Mark. On to Chapter 3***

About every six weeks, my eyebrows are on the verge of appearing more like hairy werewolf beasts and head on over to Traditions of India. Yes, it's located not far from the Costco entrance in Christown Mall but for the charge of $10 for eyebrows and a simply clean up, why not?  I highly recommend this place. Cheers***

After a foot injury and dealing with Plantar Fasciitis for the last few years, my physical therapist suggested I try custom Orthotics. I liked that the Hamiliton Prosthetics' Central Phoenix location is not that far from where I live and parking is easy.  This was actually my second visit to address my concerns about custom insoles. Dave added padding to my running insoles for more cushion, at no charge, and recommended that if I didn't see an improvement on my own, to return.    On a whim, I drove by and Steve was free prior to an appointment - so I asked questions and finally deicded to have my feet molded for the custom insoles. Yes, they're a bit pricey but after this injury, I have to consider all options so I won't have to deal with this again.   Insole are in...No really...they're in my shoes right now! I feel like Dorothy in her fabulous pair of Pumps. I'm not wearing Pumps though...but anyway, I'm so happy and most of all my feet are happy. I have to get used to the feel of the insoles in shoes before I can take them out for a run. Thanks Steve for all your help. Cheers***

I remember when Ro and I ate at this restaurant on the day it first opened years and years ago. We were the 4th table to occupy this place. While our food was being made, the manager gave us coupons for free margaritas on our return visit. I never returned to the restaurant until this past Saturday.   I purchased a special on Living Social and realized we had to use it before Dec. 12th. So we trekked down and enjoyed a great meal. Loved the Chicken Quesadilla! Adam, our waiter, was great as well. I'm certain we'll be back to this place. Cheers***

After running my first half marathon in 13 years, I was ready to run a local race. I really didn't want to be part of a huge running affair so thought that this would be an ideal race.   Pick up of Bib and goodie bag at Expo was easy.  Start of Race was basic and simple. Scenic route until I hit Camelback Road. I thought I would never get off of that road. Worse part of this race were Mother Nature's elements: Rain, Cold, Wind, & a bit of Hail...all part of a runner's world, eh? By Mile 11, I was over it and just wanted to cross the finish line. Loved the atmosphere at Westgate City Center as I ran for the Finish Line. Spectators were incredible.   Congrats to IMS, the race directors, sponsors, volunteers, and everyone else that was involved. I look forward to next year's race. Cheers***

Here's a quick quickie! I LOVE The Grind. I was introduced to this place by good friend, Carole. Miss Carole knows the best of the best hot spots and restaurants in Phoenix. Today was my 3rd visit and I can't say enough about this place and the food. I always have my regular: Mesquite charred chicken wings served with cool salad, crispy vegetables and Onion Rings & Herbed fries.  ***This place serves the best chicken wings in my opinion.*** Choice of drink: Argentina's Layer Cake Malbec & a glass of Iced tea. For dessert: I always share Warm doughnuts with salted butterscotch. I do my best to only have one...I have to guard my girlish Size 6 figure! Always seated promptly. Food never takes long to arrive & servers/ bartenders continue to fill my glass of iced tea. I am easy to please...and this place does it for me every time. Bravo! Cheers***

This year's Devoured Phoenix was incredible! I attended this event with two good friends and we had a complete blast. I ran a half marathon on Sunday morning and was ready to pig out throughout Sunday afternoon. It was great to see so many friends all in one place enjoying amazing food samples from various Independent restaurants throughout the valley. Loved so many of  the wines from many of the wineries here in our state. Food wise, I had so many favorites I can't even remember the samples or the restaurants. As for the wine, my fave was Arizona Stronghold's Nachise.   After the event, we took the light rail back to our cars, headed home, and slept like a baby. Thank you to the The Phoenix Art Museum, the organizers, restaurants, wineries, and the amazing volunteers. I look forward to next year's event! Cheers***

I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!

Love this place. Joy decided on Seasons 52 for our last Happy Hour get together of 2013. We arrived at 3:45pm (Dec. 31st) -- Hostess was a bit bitchy and rude. Once we were seated we no longer had to worry about her. We were served our drinks and appetizers by an awesome server (I wish I could remember her name). She then informed us that Danielle G. would take over as our server. She was incredible as well. Food was amazing. Desserts were tasty and just the right amount as to not affect my Size 4 figure.  This is another fave Happy Hour & Dinner place for 2014! Cheers***

I have been a Nike whore for years and years. When I took up running, my Nike 'whoreness' went to the next level. I bought Nike shoes that allowed for Nike+ Sensor pods to be placed to work with my Nike+ Sportwatch GPS. I love my watch. It's chic, sleek, and for the most part...it does work. I've had two watches that failed me and this time I had authorization to replace and do an even exchange at this Nike store location. This was pain free. I did do a bit of shopping as well and left with a few running gear items and a new sleek watch.   I'm definitely a fan of this location. I didn't realize that this store has it's own running group. I do belong to the best running group in the valley at Runner's Den but I would consider cheating now and then and train/run with this group. Cheers***

I had to do an exchange and shop a bit at the Nike store nearby. While walking back to the car, I decided to treat myself to a little somethin' somethin' at Tk's Urban Tavern for a personal Happy Hour.   Jenny was my waitress -- kewl Chica! They offer great appetizers and drink specials for HH. I ordered a tasty personal pizza and a side salad. Both were delish. I love the interior and set up of this restaurant. I will definitely be back. Cheers****

Yesterday was one of those days. After work, I told myself, "B*tch, you need a drink!" So I've been dying to try the Nutella Espresso Martini at 32 Shea...this drink is fantabulous! I had two along with a Chicken Raspberry Salad. Delicious. If it weren't for a group run later that same evening I would have stayed and tried a slice of the Nutella Mascarpone Cheesecake.  It's not even Noon and I'm craving a Nutella Espresso Martini -- give me strength Patron Saint of All Things Nutella!!!!

I prefer Boot Camp style gyms to ordinary gyms. I need that added support and motivation to get the workouts done. I'll admit that I was completely spoiled thanks to Amen & Amenzone Primal Training. When Amen still had his location downtown Phoenix, I was a huge fan. Once he moved to Scottsdale, I just wasn't willing to deal with the traffic since it was in the opposite direction of work and my every day life. I've tried various other Boot Camps but none compared.   ::::Sound the Horns!:::: That all changed when I was checking out Underground Fitness and this gym offered a great discount to new customers. I jumped on that offer and so thankful that I did. I've been training mostly with Jake. I love the early morning 5:30am TRX workouts.   This past Friday, I tried their 5pm Happy Hour Workout. It's an intense 30 minute workout...and was definitely a great way to end the week's stress before heading out for Happy Hour. I highly recommend this gym for those of you that prefer Boot Camp style gyms. They offer various style class --- calendar is located on their site. Give 'em a try! Cheers***

Another quickie quickie --- I'm all about the quickies! Since I started boot camp training at Underground Fitness, I've lost a total of 13 pounds. Thanks to the trainers, I have a better understanding of nutrition. My man boobs aren't in the way as much so trainers Jake, Scott, Brian & Monica must be doing somethin' right! :) Be prepared to give it all you got and leave knowing you had an awesome workout. I highly recommend this gym if you're in the Central Phoenix area. Cheers***

I'm all about Chicken Wings and they do have delicious Chicken Wings. Wings were tasty and had a spicy taste even though I ordered the regular ones. It paired quite nicely with a Malbec. I was told I could sit where ever we liked so I picked a table furthest from the performing musician. He was very talented with a great sound but was far too loud. Tamra and I will definitely return soon. Cheers***

If I could give this location, 10 Stars, I would. Years ago, I used to purchase all my candles from this same location.  The Candle Shop was sold but the candles continue to be made from this location. Weeks ago, I had a new stereo installed at Audio Express and was told it would be about an hour's wait. I decided to head into this store and look around. I found the perfect side table. Because I was short on time, I had to put off the decision for later.  It wasn't until mid last week that I returned to this store with Ro so I could show him the table and furniture ideas for our home. Lynn was working that day and she personally showed us around. She was such a delight -- far from pushy and completely understanding.  We purchased the side table. She later mentioned that this business has a warehouse and invited us to look around. It was there in the warehouse I 'found' the perfect tapas table. Made in India -- the table top was part of a ceiling -- green with robust colors. Along with the table, we purchased chairs that would be ideal for the table and side table. All this was because of Lynn. Thank you so much Lynn for all your help -- we look forward to having you over for Tapas and Wine! Check this place out! Cheers***

I don't shop here often but have stopped in to pick up race packets from time to time and like how I'm always acknowledged and asked about my running and training.

It was time for a change --- Love my Stylist but have been craving an old school barber shop cut. From the moment I stepped into Matthew's shop, I felt good about the moment. He listened to what I wanted and gave me exactly the haircut I've been missing. The massage at the end was the best! I love that he only accepts Cash -- just like the old days. I feel prettier than usual!!! Matthew is my new Barber! Cheers***

I have always enjoyed Happy Hours with friends at Hotel Palomar's Lustre Bar so it was time to try the Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails. A friend that lives in Downtown Phoenix invited me this morning for breakfast and I accepted. For me, it's always fun to head downtown for a bit of 'Metro' fun -- there's nothing like the noises of downtown City life. Back to BHK&C, I love the decor and that it's located in the hotel lobby.   We decided to try the Brioche French Toast & Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Both were tasty and portions were just right. & Coffee was delish! Service was outstanding. I look forward to an evening Dinner here. Oh my...their Happy Hour fries would be ideal right about now! Cheers***

There's nothing like meeting up with good friends on Saturday or Sunday for breakfast or brunch. It's nice to see an additional local restaurant along this strip. The Tortilla Espanola was delicious and I did sample a yummilcious bite from a Banging Pocket entree. The cozy decor is inviting. The coffee alone is worthy to make me a continued patron of this place. I'm happy to add this restaurant to a string of Breakfast joint faves within Central Phoenix. Cheers!!!

I've been to this cozy little spot on Indian School Road a few times. The first time it was quite busy & packed and didn't really get a chance to get a feel for the place. We only had drinks but the service was outstanding. Thanks to the good service, I suggested  to a friend that we return for Happy Hour. I love the HH menu. It was quiet this time around and really enjoyed atmosphere.  Last night, I was invited out to meet friends for dinner. Since I'm doing my best to maintain my Size 4 figure, it's not all too often that I order a full entree for myself. While ordering, I noticed a pollo entree that was being served to a table next to ours and decided to give it a try. Chicken was a heavenly delight! I sampled a few bites of various tacos at our table and everything was just amazing. Milagro Cafe will be at the top of my list for Happy Hour & Dinner. Cheers***

Pig & Pickle --- simply fabulous! I enjoyed every moment with two good friends last night. We shared various items on the Happy Hour menu: Pork Shoulder Tostadas. 'dump truck' salad, Beer Cheese and Bread & the tasty Creamy Broccoli and Brown Ale Soup with Wisconsin Cheddar & Bacon. Great Food, Friends, Conversations & Laughs. I understand why Pig & Pickle was voted by readers in the New Times Best of Phoenix 2013 in the categories of Best Late Night Nosh & Best Happy Hour. Great staff as well. This will definitely be at the Top of my Favorites List. Cheers***

I admit I'm a donut whore...not just for any donut, I do have standards, ya know?!?!?! I'm a Krispy Kreme donut whore. Ever since most of the Krispy Kreme shops near my side of town closed, all other donuts have been much like the 'rebound'  of donuts. It's not the same.   So on the way back home from a killer 5:45am Primal boot camp class at AmenZone, i decided to take Bell to the 51 and swing South rather than go down Greenway. There it was...A Krispy Kreme store. Praise! I almost cried with joy as I passed it as I was about to enter onto the freeway. Wait? I passed it? Hold up wait a minute. Yep, I had to make a U--eee and head back for a few donuts. Yes, I bought three. Ahhh...I told myself I earned those precious calorie filled babies. I probably didn't but oh well. It's done and it was worth it. Life is all about the Simple things & pleasures...and Krispy Kreme donuts!

This cafe gem was created by the Chef and owner of Gallo Blanco Café -- as a huge fan of GBC, I was looking forward to this restaurant. Atmosphere is nice and cozy.  I ventured out with three friends so we could each order a differ entree and sample & taste.  Chips & salsa were hot and tasty. I had the Caldo de Pollo con Fideo Chino & an Otro salad (Gotta keep it light to maintain my Size 4 figure!!!) --- simply delish. I had samples of the Mole Negro -- YUMMILICIOUS! The Paella Mexicana wasn't a fave but it's something I would never order for myself. Overall, I loved the food and definitely look forward to sharing more times with good friends here at Otro Cafe.

I began my AmenZone quest and journey back during the days when Amen took up 'shop' in downtown Phoenix. Gym was very much like those at thee current fitness centers. When Amen opened the North Scottsdale location, I decided it was much too far to drive from Central Phoenix so I began to a brief stint at another local gym.  Once you have experienced the best in a Core and Boot Camp style gym, it's hard to try or go anywhere else. I decided to return to AmenZone and am completely happy with my decision.   Trainers Tommy, Taylor, Summer, & La Mar are incredible. Give it all you've got for a session and leave satisfied along with an inspirational message that keeps you mentally focused on goals in and out of the gym.  This is it for me. I'll never train at another boot camp style gym. I'm happy to share that I've kept 75 pounds off (***Why yes, I am a Size 4!***) and have gained quite a bit of muscle. I finally have the confidence to train for a full marathon. So thank you to Amen and all his trainers, as well as those in my training classes, that keep me on track and motivated. AmenZone -- a worthy addiction.

I was really looking forward to this Yelp Elite Event simply because it had been a while since I enjoyed the company of so many wonderful people within this group. I'm not a Steak person nor had I ever been to an Outback before so my mind was set to mingle and enjoy the moment.  As always our fearless Yelp leader, Lindsey and her awesome new intern, Jessica, planned a perfect evening for everyone. One by one, the Servers brought out delish appetizers. I'm all about the appetizers so I loved 'em all! Since my weight loss and better eating habits, I cut out social drinking. So no drinks for me...but those that did order clearly enjoyed the Foo Foo drinks!  My beautiful friend, Cheryl, was a bit too happy after her first Crisp Red Apple Martini...so it must have hit the spot! A Yelp Bingo / social mingle game was played which was a great reason to mix and mingle.   After viewing their menu, I would definitely return to Outback. Thank you to Outback, Lindsy, Jessica and all those at Yelp that hooked us up with a great evening.  I'll be meeting a friend for Lunch at this same location today. Cheers***

Ro and I were in the mood for a little snack before heading to the movies in Scottsdale so I decided on Mexx32. Since he's never been here before, I thought it would be the ideal treat for Happy Hour. As many times I've been to this place, I've never tried their HH. Weather was perfect for outdoor patio seating!  I love their Happy Hour menu.  We had the quesadillas, guacamole and two flour tacos. Chavez was our served and he was incredible. Food and service great as always. Ro loved Mexx32 and I'm certain we'll return more often. Cheers***

Love this place! I was a client of a nearby barber shop but the wait became ridiculous and decided to try another spot. I arrived when they opened at 9am on a Thursday and Juan took me immediately. I have a simply cut and he did exactly what I said and result looked great!  I highly recommend this place and Juan. Thanks! Cheers***

Stopped in after work because a good friend was already there with coworkers and suggested I do a quick pit stop on the way home. By the time I arrived, group had finished their wings -- they looked and smelled fabulous! Group and myself ordered Beignets. There is no place that can compete with  the Beignets from Café du Monde in New Orleans but this place comes pretty darn close! I loved every bit of my heavenly pastry. I will definitely be back for Wings. Cheers***

I really really wanted to Love this Pizzeria on the first try. My best friend is having a birthday this week and thought I'd stop in to get her a gift card. This is her FAVE FAVE place -- she lived in Chicago and has been looking forward to this pizzeria to open in Phoenix. --- We were seated at a high table up front. Ro asked about about the gift cards at the front counter and were told that the credit card machine was down and could only accept cash.  We thought that was OK since we had enough cash on hand. After waiting 12 minutes without a server coming to our table, I decided to purchase a gift card and leave. I explained to the manager what happened and she offer a weak apology. We'll try again after the sour taste from this visit wears off.

I so want to love this place, and it's other locations, but no deal, Sporto. Food we had was nothing grand. The Chipotle Black Bean Burger had an odd mesh of flavors. I did like the Lemonade Tea. I doubt I'll return. Happy that many of my friends like their food but it's just not for me.

I love this place! I love that there is assigned seating when tickets are purchased. Majority of the people seated in front of us weren't seated in their correct seats but it happens...too much always too much.  Love the reclined seats. Sound and viewing is ideal. I was once a huge movie goer but not so much now. I usually would head out to the Harkins theater at Christown mall because it's conveniently close to home...but will head out to this particular cinema and treat myself to future movie viewings.   My first movie viewing here? 'Joy': Loved it!!!

I love The Camby -- Happy to know that it's part of the Marriott's Autograph Collection. Very chic Lobby. Enjoyed the walk to the Artizen. Love the varied choices on the menu. Since I'm working on my Size 4 figure for Summer, I decided to try the Camby Tortilla Soup. Slightly differ take on spices -- I liked! Artizen salad is light and tasty. I had a bite of Selma's Chorizo Torta and it was AMAZING!   It's great to see this grand property up and running again. I will definitely make this a fave in the area rather than dining arcoss at the Biltmore Fashion Square. Cheers***

I love the new location -- inside the same building as the Papi Chulo's Mexican restaurant.The old location was a mess but I adore Howard and he's the main reason for returning often. Howard's routines are always fresh and funny. Enough about Howard...can't let his head get any bigger. Ha! Best comedians weekend after weekend. Thanks to this place, I have twice been a part of Lynne Koplitz's audience -- she is my favorite comedienne. Love the set up --- very intimate. Reminds me of the audience set up of various smaller clubs you'd see on TV comedy shows.    *** This comedy club is guaranteed not to run out of chips...and I love my Chips and Salsa/Guacamole! Congratulations and thanks Howard for a great comedy venue. Continued success on your new place! Support this comedy club and be ready to laugh & laugh. Cheers***

Listen up, Howard & Myrna! This place is amazing! This used to be a Dairy Queen. Places looks a bit run down but go in and order and you'll be amazed. Their Tacos, Burritos and Gorditas are incredible. Great service and the people that run and work the counter are down to earth good people.   Ro and I often enjoy Tapas at various places in one evening for variety and this place is always on our list. Give this new business a try -- you won't be disappointed. Cheers***

Stopped in for a quick cup of coffee before heading to the Barber Shop down the street. I was very impressed with this intimate coffee shop. Coffee was amazing and staff were extremely friendly. I hardly ever go out and dine on Roosevelt Row...but I will definitely return to this place often. Cheers***

First and foremost, I love how clean this place is. The people that work here are extremely friendly and nice. Those two factors is the main reason why I'll always be a fan of this place. Now on the the pizza --- I love the concept of build your own pizza. One of my best friends suggested the White Top pizza so that's what we ordered. Wow...such a great choice. The Applewood bacon was amazing...along with the other toppings of Mozzarella, Chopped garlic, Oregano, and Arugula in a tasty White cream sauce,  I will definitely return and build my own pizza next time. Give this place a try! Cheers***

Far overpriced and a bit too 'Berkeley' for me. It's nothing like the previous store. I'll pass and drive a bit further to Sprouts or Whole Foods.

Junior is now my 'Big Daddy' Barber! I was a regular at another barber shop but after leaving that place with a haircut not quite what I wanted, I decided to give Junior a try. Junior asked me exactly what I wanted in a cut and style. I don't know the hair lingo but I explained to him and he knew exactly what I wanted. I left with the haircut and style I wanted. I will now be a regular client of Junior's.   I love that it's not to far from where I live and next to a Starbucks --- I'll be back soon! Please give Junior a try. Cheers***
