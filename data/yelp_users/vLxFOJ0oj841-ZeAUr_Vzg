I love 24 Fitness.  I would consider myself kind of a gym snob, very picky about cleanliness and equiptment.  Staff friendliness is huge!  This 24 Hour delivers.  Always kind faces, and clean facilities.  I drive past 3 other gyms to get to this one.  The big deal clencher was the cleanliness of the steam room and sauna.  I searched high and low for a CLEAN steam room.  All the patrons are friends with one another.   I got a sweet deal through buying a two year membership at costco, so it ends up being $12 or $14 per mo.    The cardio equipt is a little cheesy...some of them don't incline, etc, but they have a TRX suspention strap system and large undulation/ throw ropes. The managment really has a pulse on what it's clientel is looking for.   Not alot of standing around trying to impress and take up space like I've seen at other gyms.  People come here to do what they love.  The patrons here are more mature, both mentally and physically and being a student myself, I really like the family friendly atmosphere.  would highly recommend, unless all you care about is good cardio equiptment, then I would say...go play with some wieghts :)

Found this place due to Groupon.  Got brazilian area treated, and was seeing success, but my laser tech who is super friendly does the treatment so fast, she skips over huge areas, and that is very obvious at the end of my package.  Areas of hair loss are super patchy, and if my tech had been consistent with laser pulses, the treatment would have been a success.  If you are thinking about using them, I can't help but think that they give discount treatment to discount customers- especially in large areas where you can't see the treatment.  I have one treatment left, and I'm going to say something to her about it.  I had canceled an appointment over the phone (they require 24 hours notice) and they claimed they never got my message, and took away one of my pre-paid appointments.

Historic District Resale Mall is awesome! Great prices!  I bought a beautiful Korean dresser with 3 piece mirror for $60. (dovetailed joints, unscratched finish, even shabby chic drawer liners!) Large spiral wrought iron plant stand with green glass shelves, $35, and silver platter for $3! The owner has an impeccable knowledge of every item in her store, and was very pleasant and informative. Bathrooms across street.  Store was clean and organized, with classic antique store charm.  The location is fabulous, and extremely easy to get to- right off Grand Ave and the 101 West.     LOVE the character and quality of the merchandise here.  I will be going back again as soon as I can.  If you want great prices and tons of selection that hasn't been picked through, go to Historic District Resale Mall.
