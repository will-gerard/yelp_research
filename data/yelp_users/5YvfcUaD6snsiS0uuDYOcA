Pretty Awesome. Got a screaming deal on my dog crates that I got. Saved me at least $50 between the two of them by getting them here instead of anywhere else (including online). Pretty good prices on the little things too (toys, leashes, etc.). It makes sense I heard from this place from someone in the industry because they have commercial size grooming products and commercial style kennels.   The place is bait difficult to navigate around. They give you a map if that gives you an idea... I mean to be fair the reviews I read set me up with proper expectations, but once I got there I was lost in the warehouse even using the map. Also, the owner (co-owner? not sure) is cranky and rude. She is quite old, but that shouldn't be an excuse. The front desk staff definitely made up for it with how great they were. Hats off to you!  Overall excited to find Ryan's and will definitely be back.

Stopped in for lunch on a weekday. Service is nothing special, but the food is pretty good.   The $5 Gyro special was a good value, mint iced tea was refreshing, and the lemon rice soup was AWESOME. I don't know how I had never had this soup before, but I am very excited to grab lunch there again sometime soon.

I look forward to the days I get my Angel Food smoothie with no turbinado. Ever since I started drinking smoothie king I am unable to really enjoy jamba juice smoothies. Right up my alley.

Anytime my boyfriend and I want an incredible meal for a celebration we always end up going to Cibo. Never disappointed.   Our anniversary, New Years, and my birthday most recently. Always consistently delicious. We normally split a bottle of Scarpetta Pinot Grigio and then the Burrata appetizer (only gripe would be that the Burrata has TONS of tomatoes on the dish recently. We miss the old days with ALL burrata!). For the pizza we normally get the Diavola. SO good!   I am the type of person who tries lots of things on the menu first, but we found our favorites at Cibo and there's no turning back!

Good wings and burger deals! Their happy hour is decent and the edamame appetizer is bomb.   Wine Sunday's are a treat, love the patio, friendly staff, and overall good service. My gripe would be their brunch menu at all the vigs - it's nothing decent, but that's nothing specific to this location.   Minimal parking if you don't want to valet, which I never do, so ride your bike or bring cash to tip the valet peeps.

I'm a Dutch brothers fan. This location disappointed me though. Walked up to order my drink, waited in a line, and wasn't unhappy to do so.   What I wasn't cool with was when I watched three of the employees "shotgun" energy drinks from aluminum cans inside. They all three had blue "Rebel" cans they poked holes in the side, placed to their mouth, popped that soda tab open, and chugged. Two of them even threw their cans to the ground in typical frat boy fashion.   It was incredible to watch to be honest. Like the defiant "hold onto your youth" part of me wanted to cheer, but the adult in me was like "I would hate if I was the manager of this shop knowing my employees were acting that way". And so I reviewed. I get DB has a funny environment, but I don't think this is what they had in mind.

I like Hula's because their food is pretty consistent. At least in my experience. My favorite is the poke. I crave it! Every time I get something other than the poke I always wish I made a different decision. Love the Mai Tais too.   The food is good, not great. We normally go for brunch specials or weekly happy hour all day special. Makes it worth it for us. They seem to always have new waitresses who tend to make the experience inconsistent. They forget things, like to get our order or refill our drinks. We go enough that we expect this and it's worth the happy hour pricing.

Boyfriend and I came for a celebratory dinner and were so happy we did! Flavors were incredible. Everything we tried was great. Small dishes, but we expected that.   Great food.

I stumbled upon this place when yelping for a coffee shop while across town for work.  My main gripe would be the location being very hard to find. I had to make 2 U-turns even using navigation to find this place. The gal that works here mid week is very sweet and personable. I have been in multiple times and hope she is there. A gentleman was working with her one weekend and he was not the friendliest.   That iced cuban coffee is delicious.I will continue to come back to grab an iced cuban when on that side of town and hope my favorite barista is working. :)

The DIVIDER is brilliant! Helping indecisive people like myself live an easier life! Can't make decisions? NO PROBLEM!   Zoyo has good flavors in rotation, a nice environment to enjoy your froyo, and an awesome toppings bar.

HOLY MOLY!   My once a year donut cravings now have a home! A dozen donut holes for 99 cents? Shut up.... This is no joke. Plus its open 24/7- this could get dangerous since its only two blocks away from home.   We got two of the normal donuts too. My boyfriend got a vanilla frosted one with sprinkles and I got a strawberry glazed one with pink sprinkles! yummmmmy! I am excited mostly because I feel like fried airy dough should be cheap, and obviously Bosa gets that. Reasonable prices, yummy, and there when you need it. Thanks for being so supportive, Bosa!

This place is brilliant!   Screw chipotle! I order enchiladas at a Mexican restaurant anyway, so why not custom make them, in an assembly line fashion?   Delicious, vegetarian options, has beer, and something for just about anyone!

So its the second time I have been here, and I shouldn't have waited for this review. From the moment I took my first bite I was obsessed. Even after my boyfriend and I left we discussed how great it was. For weeks since our last visit we mentioned how we should get snoh. We are pretty much replacing the words "ice cream" and "froyo"with snoh. The thought of all desserts have been replaced with the thought of our next snob fix.   Purple Fusion is delicious! Taro snoh with almond cookie crumbs, almond pudding, and condensed milk drizzle. The girl told us to add black sesame drizzle which is also bomb.I look forward to our next trip in, and to trying more flavors. That may not before a while though since we are so satisfied with our purple fusion.   STOP READING THIS IS GO GET YOU SOME!

Stopped in before the gym to get some supplements I left at home. AWESOME customer service. Quick visit but was very pleased. Will make this location a priority when in the area.

Worst tropical smoothie experience ever. Their smoothies are always good, but today's service would shut a place down.   The girls that work here are unfriendly, even borderline disrespectful. There were 9 people ahead of my order, so I expected to wait. The girls never once greeted anyone, or even said have a nice day. One customer asked for her receipt and the girl who was ringing up said "CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE??" In a rude tone. I was irritated by it across the room. My smoothie came up and the cup had spilled smoothie all over it.   I'll stick with my typical tropical smoothie and steer clear of here.

Ugh! I ordered damn iced coffees! Like, it doesn't get any easier than that. Waited 12 minutes in line, paid, and then was told they were out. WTF?   Get your shit together. Brew it while I wait for 12 minutes - not after I pay at the window, and you're barely starting my drinks. Absurd.

This place is delicious. My boyfriend and I went for dinner and were recommended to get the Pub shrub as a drink. Glad we did! The hint of jalape√±o in the drink is not overwhelming, and adds a unique flavor to a typical cocktail.   We started with the honey ginger soy wings, which we have already discussed how to recreate that flavor for our meals at home. That sauce paired with their dill ranch dressing they make creates an awesome combination. We got the truffle macaroni and cheese, which I knew I would love since I am a truffle fanatic.   Finally, we got their special pizza of the night. It was suppose to be sausage, pepperoni, and prosciutto but we think we got the wrong one cause we never saw any sausage. Anyway, it was pretty good, but nothing special. Pizza is almost always delicious and this was no exception but noteworthy.

I love the Clever Koi.   We normally get the lemongrass chicken ramen, which is my favorite, and my boyfriend loves the salt and pepper soft shell crab. Normally we pair those with some small dish items (sticky buns, dumplings etc.).   The make incredible cocktails that take some time to make, but are worth the wait. The staff is really good at recommending drinks based on your likes.   Everything we have ever had is delicious. Most the time we would get irritated at the price per portion for some of the items, but the flavor makes up for it. They also have some awesome weekly specials - two entrees and drinks for $45+. Was worth it for us.

In town for work and grabbed lunch. Cool concept and good food, but the reviews made this place sound incredible.   The truffle fries were alright. Light truffle flavor so tasted pretty normal. The balsamic steak plate, which I can't remember the name of, was exactly what you'd imagine it to taste like.   Wasn't disappointed, but def not five star worthy in my opinion. Staff was very friendly and environment was welcoming.

Loved angry crab when it was on the Alma School location, but was SOOO pleasantly surprised when they opened this location minutes from my house!   Love the price per portion. Always feel like we left satisfied and didn't pay ridiculous seafood prices. Flavored are awesome. Love the trifecta crab and shrimp. GET THE SAUSAGE! Super good.   Staff is friendly and we have never had service concerns here.   I could go on for days.We are regulars for life!

Glad to have a decent sushi restaurant in Arcadia area. We drive to downtown or Scottsdale normally because Stingray, Delux, sushi station etc. just don't do it for us.   Went last night for dinner and was pretty happy. Good sushi, conveniently located, and friendly staff. Their happy hour right now is everyday which is awesome! Excited for the good addition and hope it stays as consistent for when we want casual, close by sushi.
