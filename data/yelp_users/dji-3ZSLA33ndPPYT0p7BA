I'm not familiar with the theater, but this was a really nice experience for me and my family. The stage is kind of small and intimate, but the balcony is really roomy and nice. The exterior is really pretty and old and full of character.

This place was a lot of fun to bring the kids. When we got there, the wait was pretty short, my husband requested a seat in the train, so we walked around the lobby while our table was being prepared. I'm glad we had the time to stroll around, all the creepy old rooms were awesome. The PacMan game is a great touch.  As we approached the table, my 5 year old's smile stretched from to ear at the sight of walking up those train car stairs. Our server was prompt and courteous. Our food was good, I had the cheese ravioli, the kids had some spaghetti, and my husband had the chicken Marsala. But  I'm not a foodie, so this is not about the food. It was about the ambiance. Which was fantastic. The food was good enough to not lose any stars because of it.   The refills were on point. The only negative was that all of the tables around us were dirty. But I think that's because the train is too small to have a busser in there while customers are there. It, at the very least, would be a tight fit with the possibility of him bumping in to us.  The check was small. Love that. It's a very affordable restaurant.  Next time we come, we're riding the tram and sitting at the bar. I forgot how cool this place was. We were glad the kids had a weird spaghetti craving that night.

We used to have a membership here, and we loved it then. We would bring the kids, and although they don't have a TON of stuff for little ones, it was a very happy medium for us fact-hungry parents. We had passes and would bring friends with us all the time who loved it.  We went again, just the two of us, for the Yelp event. And it was amazing. I loved the little hands on exhibit that they had, and the way they have the exhibits set up is just so perfect. We are now DYING to try out the bike ride, cable thing. And the planetarium is just... breathtaking. Loved it. The staff is always great, and they are so knowledgeable!  The one downside is that not only are they kinda pricey for the whole family, but then they charge for the extra exhibits on top of it. If me and my little family of 4 wanted to check out everything, it would easily cost us a hundred bucks.   But even with that, the planetarium and staff pull my rating all the way up to 5 stars. You can see the prices online, and it's not geared to very small children. But if you want something specifically for them, try the children's museum. All in all, what a great addition to our blossoming city!

I would be hesitant to rate this so high, because I love me my good antique stores. But I went in to browse their men's dress outfits because we are looking for a vest for my husband to be. Well, we found it! I can't believe we found it so easily. The lady was so nice and told us she would hold it for 24 hours so we can look some other places before making the final decision. The way the place is set up is so awesome. I loved how the little diner was in the middle. We were going to go there but just felt like something different for dinner. The whole feel of this place is completely unique and fun. The store is all spread out so you never have someone breathing down your neck asking what you want. I will definitely be back to this place. Probaby today :)

I love zoos!! And this one is great. I come here about once a year with my kiddos (who are now 7 & 9). It's just as cool when they're older as when they were teeny tiny. The monkey exhibit is my favorite, since they're wild and free and all around you!  We really enjoyed the presentation they give with the orangoutangs. The staff here really know their stuff! The rhinos are also really cool. And they have a really fun bird show here as well.   One of my favorite visits was when we got to pet the sting rays. The kids and I had so much fun letting them glide under our hands. And bonus, no stingers!   The food here is of course pricey, so eat before you get there if you can.

This place is great. We've taken friends, out of towners, and family here. We went here the night of my bachelorette party. The food is good. I've had the hummus.. mmm I forgot what other food I had here. The service is great, there are pool tables and darts. The bathrooms are horrible, but you really go in expecting that. The big comfy booths are key. The outdoor area is really nice at night under the misters. We had one lame waitress once. She did a good enough job but had the sense of humor of a wet mop.   This place is always a good time.

I'm giving this place a 5 star rating because what I remember of the night was 5 star worthy! We were walking around downtown on my birthday night with a bunch of peeps and couldn't decide where to go. Finally, someone suggested Pomeroy's. So we walked over. Honestly, I don't remember walking anywhere after, but I do know that I got home. So... I can't really comment on the walk and location.  When I ran off to the bathroom for 3 minutes, my husband succeeded in tracking down the waitress and having her rush a piece of cake out to our table so they could sing to me upon my return. That was pretty much the coolest thing ever. On my way to that aforementioned bathroom venture, I passed a girl who I heard push through to the front of the bar yelling in the most annoying voice ever "hey! Let me up there! It's my birthday!"    uh no. It's my birthday b.tch. Back off.  We drank and ate and were merry. It was a good time. I've passed by the place in the day and it looks completely different then how it did that night.

I kinda don't want to review this place so that we can keep it as nice as it was on Friday. My husband and I got a night to ourselves so we tried this place out. It was delicious. But other than that, the service was wonderful, the live music was so cool, and the crowd was chill. Strange that everyone else in the restaurant opted to sit far from the music. We chose to be right by the band and it was the best decision ever. This place is great, it will definitely become a regular for us. We can't wait to take the kids!

Kidless for the weekend.. rode the tram back and forth, saw clubbers bobbin their heads like they were too cool for school.. glittery tube tops, guys in sweaters.. nothin cool on the town, so we had a whiskey and coke at home and headed straight to gay denny's. Ahh... so much more entertaining then the lame-o stilletto wearin, sweater vest kanye wannabe club scene. So many people around to people watch, interesting conversations to over hear. refreshing, really! I love you gay denny's. Especially when you are full of fire men. I was there that day, and you were beautiful.

I don't get all the negativity! We went there..  me, my guy, my son, and my daughter. 20 bucks. No joke. And it's not gross. Some of the enchilada sauce was a little closer to ketchup, but it really wasn't bad. I loved some of it, and the sopapillas in themselves bumped this place up a star. Mmmm with honey and sugar right there on the table for ya. This was a good idea, I'm glad we went. Oh, and the waiter was so nice. Everyone in there was super nice. The owner told me ways to try the sopapillas when I went up for more.  I'm rating this as a BUFFET, because that's what it is. Did you really expect gourmet in a mexican buffet? come on..

Wow. I usually go to salons, and that's where I take the kids. But this time, we went in a big group, 5 (walk-in) cuts in total, ages 17,13,13,13, and 8. Total price 66.00 plus tip. Holy good haircuts, Batman! I was really blown away by the level of skill that this place had to offer. Aren't these cheap places kinda crappy? My perspective has changed. We walked in and walked out in about an hour. Craziness.  I will have to come back and add names of the stylists. For now, there's pink hair and piercings girl- super smiley, very friendly, and she did a great job on the 2 13 year old girls. Then, there was the other lady. Wish I knew her name.. I think it started with an H. She was also very nice, and very good. The 17 year old LOVED her hair. She's been raving about it for 2 days now. She also cut the 13 year old boy's hair. It was exactly what his Dad wanted him to get. It looked perfect! And then, my boy. A man cut his hair. He was not very friendly. I felt like I was an imposition. But he gets 5 stars anyways, because I honestly have never seen such a GREAT cut on my Son. His Dad wanted him to cut off his long hair and I was really disappointed. His hair is blonde, so when it's short, it looks almost see-through. This guy did an amazzzzzing job and I could not be happier.   All in all, I'm highly satisfied! Definitely the new family spot.

Holy bad reviews and grumpy pantses Batman! Someone got screamed at in here? Woah.  Well, I've never had any crazy experiences at Michaels. Their birthday bag/box/tissue paper/etc. stuff is way overpriced. But their discount selection is great. And I can always find cool stuff. I have a daughter, and we did all of her Christmas shopping here. I can always find a 40% off coupon, which makes it a perfect place for little friends' bday gifts. It's a pretty big craft store, it satisfies my crafting needs in a pinch.

I'm a fan of this Marshall's. It's nice and clean and I've never had any issues. They carry VOSS water in the glass bottles, which is rare. They always have at least SOMEthing we can't live without. The kitchen section is fun. The housewares is nice. I love discount shopping, and this is always one of our first stops if we need something quick and don't want to spend a lot on it.

I really like this place, but ever since Fresh and Easy popped up behind me, it takes a lot to get me to drive the extra five minutes. Things are a pretty good price, and I love the samplers.. but F&E has great samplers too, and it's cheaper. The tortellini is an item I always grab, along with the pesto. Very very good and at a great price. I wish they had a sales section like my handy dandy F&E.. Ooo.. and I like their honey wheat pretzels..yum! And I think they are only a dollar fifty or so.. Oh, and I'm baffled at how they keep that kettle corn from going stale, but it is certainly delish!

This place is in sort of a rough area. It's not the nicest bowling alley in the whole world, the staff always seems a bit shorthanded, but it's always a good time. The bar is perfect. We love to take the kids, grab a pitcher, and play a couple games. The prices are very good, especially if you visit during a special bowl time. I'm definitely a fan of this place, the kids love it here. It's one of our summer staples.

I have been to this Bashas' a few times.. Two of the times we swore we would never go back. Once was when the manager was talking trash about an employee to the bagger that was right in front of us. The ENTIRE time we were checking out. He was so rude. The other time was when two employees were going on and on about their sex lives as they were checking us out. Pretty unprofessional if you ask me. The prices aren't too competitive, although I liked the Bashas in North Phoenix a lot when I lived there. It was worth the extra few dollars. But this one definitely is not. I would prefer Fresh and Easy, which is right across the street.

We've done the amusement park, it was pretty fun, but we like to come here for the arcade. I can put just 10 bucks on a card, and my husband, the kids, and I can be here all afternoon playing the quarter arcade games. The last time we went with 20 dollars on the card and we played whatever the kids wanted, with the intention of adding more game time. But the 20 bucks lasted us 3 hours, so we decided to call it a day after we were done.  This is always a cool, chill place to go burn off some time and treat the kids to some fun.

We brought the kids here this week and had a great time. We went on a Thursday, and there were a few field trip groups that came and went, but it wasn't too bad. It was busy on and off.   The DJ was great, he played games with the kids, and was very energetic the whole time. The kids burnt a solid 4 hours here, we had some cheese bread, the husband and I skated for a while, and then just hung out. I like how the rink is set up so we could sit right next to it on a table and watch the kids without taking our eyes off them.   The price wasn't too bad. About 60 bucks for a day of skating and pizza. What would've been awesome is beer. My husband disagreed, saying it didn't need the addition of drunk parents. I guess I agree. But a pitcher of beer would've been a really nice way to pass the time.   We will definitely be back here again.In the summertime, the kids' staples are rollerskating, bowling, and the arcade at Castles and Coasters. All cheap, fun, cool options for all of us.

The customer service at this place is great. When I went, the shop was pretty busy, but the guys working were on top of it! They knew everything about anything that had to do with riding a bike. I explained that I couldn't spend a whole lot of money on replacements for mine, so they figured out how to oil a few things up and replace a couple small things, and I was good to go! Wal-Mart bikes are history for me now that I know about real bikes. Yeah, they are a lot more expensive, but they are a lot cheaper when you figure in how many times you will have to get it fixed! The shop dog is adorable, the guys are super nice, and the selection is small.. but it's just right. Who needs a huge selection when you can have a small selection of just the right items? The helmets are the coolest on the block, and the accessories.. I didn't even know I needed so many cool additions on my bike!

gourmet? huh?  This place looked really cool so we checked it out. When we stepped in, I was excited. It looked like our kinda place. "But why does this have such a shitty vibe", I ask my fiancee... "oh, we're in scottsdale". ah. So tattoos and piercings don't mean free sprit? No, dear. Around here, it means trendy. Lots of douchebags talking loud enough to draw attention from all around them. This is not a sportsbar, though I didn't mind seeing the Suns on their big screen. I did, however, mind the annoying shouts of the d-bags arguing about the Yankees.. baseball? really guys? seriously. shut up. And fix your hat, it looks ridiculous like that. All in all, no one was nice here. If you're bringing someone to Phoenix to show them what Phoenix is like don't bring them here. This place would be cool if it were downtown with some cool staff. But it's not, so it pretty much sucks. The food isn't that great, I'd rather have bamboo grill any day. But for the cool idea of the place, I'll give it an extra star.

I am very happy that I decided to go to the Y.  With 2 little ones, it is really difficult to squeeze in workout sessions. Also, I don't like standard by-myself workouts. I joined because I was interested in all of the classes that came along with the membership.  The kids had a blast at the kid zone. My son loved the PacMan Atari game, and when I went back to grab them, I could hear them screaming down the hall! Apparently, one of the trainers had turned in to a monster and had my little guy upside down laughing until his face was blue! You have no idea what a relief it is to know that I'm not neglecting my kids, and instead they are having a great time. They are very excited to go back. I went for the Zumba class, which was rescheduled and I instead took Athletic Training. I'm not going to lie, that class totally kicked my ass. But it was a lot of fun and it was a great way to jump start my regimine. The trainer was great, friendly, and passionate about fitness. Exactly what you would want in a trainer.  I toured around, loving all of the facilities. The staff were all very friendly and down to earth. The equipment all looked brand new and professional. Much better than I would have expected. I'm really excited to continue classes at the Y. I'm definitely taking advantage of the swim lessons for my 4 year old (free with my membership this month), and my son will be enrolled in soccer in March. I love the discounts on everything! My husband is also really looking forward to his free one on one session with a personal trainer and his 6 week jumpstart program. This was a great investment for my family. I'm very excited to get back in shape for the summer!

K, I had to search for this specific McDonalds.   Like I said before, it is what it is. I rate things for what they are beyond what they are... does that make any sense??  Anyways, the people here are super friendly. There is a weird trend with fast food in this area- the workers are all oddly friendly. This place is the same way. I really can't justify a 5 star rating for a McDonalds, but I will give it 4 stars considering it's a great place to drive through for a dollar drink from time to time.

Taco Bell is what it is, rating the food is senseless. You like it or you don't. Since I'm a vegetarian, I appreciate their 7-layer burrito with 7 layers of everything but meat. And their crispy potato taco. For 89 cents, it's a basic taco with some seasoned fried potatoes, some sauce, cheese and lettuce. It's not gourmet, but I love it.  Anyways, forget about the food. The employees in this place must be making a hefty salary because ALL of them are ridiculously sweet. They are quick, but always eager to find out how you're doing. "don't feel like cooking today?" she asked me tonight "wow, I love your tattoo, how long did that take?" he asked me last time. "have a good night sweetie" I hear as I take off.   Good ol fashion personality. Love it.

This place is so cute and chic. It was closed on the first few occasions that I stopped by, but on 'girls day', with my little girl, it was open! And what a perfect place to stroll around the little princess. I wish I would have had more time to get my craft on, because the scrapbook selection was amazing! I could not believe that there is this mecca of scrapbook goodness right around the corner from my house! Love love love.

Don't like Safeways prices. At all. But this one has exceptionally great customer service that I absolutely love. Not saying I would give up my Fry's (oh, how I love their accept all competitor's coupons and knock all coupons up to a dollar)... but this is a good pick for someone who just wants good ol fashioned friendly service. They always offer to help me out the door, and the place is never a mess.

I feel funny giving this place a 5 star rating, but I rate things as they are, not to meet some higher standard that it doesn't even attempt to meet.  It's a 2nd run theater, so the tickets are super cheap. Being that we have 2 kids, we don't get a chance to see movies anyways, so this is perfect for all those movies we wished we could've seen on the big screen. It's also a cheap way to spoil the kids on a good day. Beware, just because the tickets are really inexpensive, don't assume that the snacks are an equally good deal. Because they're just as expensive as anywhere else. Knowing that, you won't be surprised. :)  The kids ABSOLUTELY LOVE the decor of the place, which is retro 80s theater, stocked with florescent lighting that luminates your way through the halls. I know that their intention was not to be 'retro', and some prefer the term 'outdated', but I happen to think it's a really cool change from the typical, boring movie theaters of today.   I don't notice any difference in the sound or picture quality, but I've never been one to care.

I was not impressed by Grimaldi's in the slightest, and I am a very forgiving and understanding customer.  The girl who served us seemed like she was ready to go home. She took our order, someone else brought the meal, and she checked on us once. Then my drink ran out and I found a bug in my food. So I'm peering around trying to get her attention unaware that she had already left and our server had changed. I suppose she forgot to mention that if we needed anything, we should ask someone else.  Moving on to the bug. I've worked at restaurants and know that these things happen.  Wouldn't have even caused a slight deduction if it were handled the way it should have been. I very quietly brought it to the attention of one of the hosts (since I couldn't find the disappearing waitress) The bartender seemed genuinely sorry. I couldn't eat the pizza anymore because all the spices looked like a butt of the fruitfly that I had just dug out of cheese pizza with my finger*ugh* The manager insisted the bug got there after he gave it to me and he "knew" that it wasn't baked in. He comped the pizza and took it away. I ordered a canoli since I was still hungry but really grossed out, and we each got a coffee with liqueur.   So we spent 30 dollars on a ruined dinner. We ordered our sodas to go with the pizza, we ordered the canoli to replace the pizza that I was starving for and didn't get to eat. I know how a good restaurant works, and A. you do not tell the customer that she was wrong and she did not just dig a bug from INSIDE of her food and B. You don't charge her for her drinks and replacement food (especially when it's a 4$ canoli). You charge for the booze if there was any (and there was)  So I'm home, an hour of my day is gone, and I'm still hungry. What I had of the food was good but I would eat dominos before paying for service that I don't receive.

This place is super great! We've always used Groupons, so there are no complaints on the price. I can think of two times in particular that were awesome.  1.) Went with the whole family. We ordered a large pizza. The pizza is not good here at all, but it filled us up and kept us in the park all day. We got there first thing in the morning and stayed all day. Everyone was happy and busy the entire time. You MUST splurge for the raft though. They aren't that expensive (I think like, 6 bucks), and you get a dollar back when  you turn them back in. They are also really cool about replacing a raft when it gets hijacked by a little turd in the wave pool.  2.) Went for my Son's birthday. Before hitting the park, we took my son, daughter, and his 3 best friends to a buffet. They all had a blast at the park and we stayed until they closed. They all got rafts. The only complaint is that the seating situation sucks pretty bad. They should invest in some more chairs.  Lots of fun for a lazy summer day. I'm sure we'll be back again next summer!

I went back to this place a couple years later and a LOT has changed! The atmosphere is pretty cool, we sat outside. I didn't actually eat anything, but the drinks were pretty good. I really liked it mainly for the atmosphere, but I'll have to go back and try out some food. Glad I gave them a 2nd chance. This might become our new Saturday morning spot.

ehhh.. I've gotten a few things here on occasion. Spanx are only around 7 bucks, my husband has found some pretty cool shoes for around 40, I got a dress there the other day. Their children's selection is not very good at all. If you're way in to plastering brands all over yourself so you can look like you spent a lot of money, then hey, this might be your paradise.   I'm just not that in to it. Although, we do go here on occasion right before they open on Saturday morning, stand at the top, and watch the herd push inside. (no, that's not my husband making the mooing noises...) It's crazy what people will do for some discount Juicy.

Went in here with a friend of mine and I really loved it. It was a bit too pricey to make a regular stop.. 5 bucks for a cupcake? yikes! But I got it anyways and it was absolutely delicious. The guy behind the counter was super nice, and the black cherry lemonade was sooo good! My friend got the green tea and really liked it. The couches and seating were also really cool.

I'm going to have to update this due to the new crowd that's in and out of this place. Man, what happened?!?! This place was really cool but now it's FULL of a weird crowd of old hipsters. weird. Now I feel underdressed when i go in here. Though the live music is still cool, it's impossible to sit down because you're squished in like sardines. We had to take the kids outside to sit down last time. They should have the band play outside rather than right next to the counter. It's all arranged very awkwardly. The drinks are just drinks. They're good, but just normal coffee shop drinks. All in all, I'm no longer impressed. Super bummer.. such a cool lookin spot.

I haven't actually stayed here, but I've hung out with friends who were, and I also attended an art show here. The pool is RAD! The rooms are really cool, and the Kurig coffee maker is awesome. You can go downstairs and ask them for anything you forgot (razors, etc.) and they'll have them on hand. It's a really accommodating place. The bar is cool, I would feel awkward going for just the bar, but hey, that's me. I've seen some cool looking roof top parties up there, but never went up to join.   I would recommend staying here to visiting guests. You can find some good deals on the place through group discount sites or sometimes just by calling the hotel.

This store is amazing! I go in here on a regular basis. Charlie is usually there, and he knows everything about everything! I've purchased great furniture, including an awesome vintage chair for my living room, all the way down to the duck cookie jar that reminded me of my Grandma's house. I can always find something, and even when I'm broke I can still splurge on a one dollar wall hanging or a 3 dollar jewelry box. This place is one of my favorite spots in the area. Great value, super finds, and always a friendly smile when I walk in the door! Oh, and it's HUGE! A lot bigger inside than it looks on the outside!

I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place! I love the Lost Leaf. It's rare that my husband and I ever get out without the kiddos, but when we do, Lost Leaf is almost always on the agenda. It's such a laid back vibe, we can't help but really enjoy ourselves.  I love that the music is in a different area so you're not so crowded when you sit down to have a drink. And for how small the place is, it's surprisingly roomy once you get inside. LOVE the art on the walls and the crowd is always great. I feel like the limited beer and wine menu keeps the frat boys out and the 'normals' in. Major perk. We usually have an Ace Pear, grab a table, and chit chat with all of our friends. I really love this place, I'm happy to see it flourish.

I think we might have had way too high of expectations for this place. I liked how nothing had nasty mayo all in it, but the selection was very minimal and they didn't give me an option for my side so I was stuck with potato chips. The lady was super friendly and the food was okay, but nothing more than I would expect to pick up at the grocery cafe store on my lunch break. Probably won't be back here even though the prices are good. But I'd honestly be happier with Subway.

This place is crazy. The first time we showed up, we went to the wrong door and got treated like idiots before we even walked in so we just left. The next time I went with someone else and when I walked in it reeked of mothballs. I could have gone to the dollar store down the road and found better items and prices. There were little packaged, dusty mustaches for $5. The same ones we got from the quarter machine at WalMart. She explained that the economy is bad and "you can quote me prices at the stores around here all you want but I shop at those antique stores so I know them like the back of my hand"...and she doesn't even want to KNOW what's on the internet, but she says her prices are the best there are. Nothing is tagged so you have to ask the price of everything, be disappointed by the answer, and be looked at like you're dumb for expecting less. When we asked what "B Movies" were, when she was explaining the theater she is trying to set up in the back, she answered with "oh(but more like eww..).. since you asked I can tell that you......" then she stopped and asked some guy to "explain to them what a B-Movie is" "oh," he says "that's just the rating of the movie.. a B". simple enough to not make us feel stupid, right? Definitely will not be in here again.

Oh my! How have I NOT reviewed this place yet?! It is amazing. This is in the top 2 of my favorite restaurants in North Phx. (the other one is Bamboo Grill) If the man is there, he is the best. Always happy to see you, and ready to chat while he cooks! I have gone in here with my mom and sister, with just me and Hubs, and with my 2 little ones. Every time the food is fantastic. If it's just the girls working, the service pales in comparison to when the guy is there.. but the food makes up for that! Try the tortilla soup! Made right there in front of you and ohhhh... sooo good! Hubby and I always share the fajitas classica.. mmm... I think that is the best way to go. And they are more than willing to give you extra of whatever you ask for. And if you throw in a dollar for them, they ring the bell and yell "AYYYY" lol Also, good prices, especially if you split something, which is totally doable since their servings are huge!

Meh. It's Starbucks. The coffee sucks, the drinks are way overpriced for what they are, and all the money goes to a corporation.  Go down the street and buy coffee from Copperstar and at the same time support the community you live in.

Went in to this place with great expectations and without even bothering to recognize that I was spending a ridiculous amount of money on a cupcake... because it was going to be SOO worth it.. egh. My fiancee and I each got one and the little ones shared a cupcake. We all had to scrape off most of the frosting.. why do all these places feel the need to put more frosting than cake? Is that how they justify the price? After all of the frosting consumption I could hardly even delve in to the cupcake. A lot of cupcake gold was thrown in to the trash can that day. Maybe I just needed a glass of milk? I don't know, but if American's are in to this than I no longer question why we are such a "large" country, if you know what I mean... Next time I'll indulge in the cupcakes at Copperstar.. which are amazing.

Went to TJ's tonight and got a couple large pizzas. Food was good, a lot better than your typical Dominos or Little Caesars. Guy was nice, took the order, got it right. Nothing really beyond that. We got some coffees from the gas station next door while we waited, that was nice. I might go here again simply because I like to shop local, but all in all I would have to say it was just okay. Maybe I'll give the wings a shot next time...

I'm not going to lie. My husband was PISSED when he got his car back. They didn't do anything he told them to do. He was livid.  But let me start from the beginning. We walked it and it was a beautiful shop. Seriously, the comfiest shop ever. The kids grabbed a seat, watched some tv, had a piece of candy. It was great. I was seriously impressed by the place. The front desk person was super sweet. The customer service was really great all around. But then we got the car back, drove it home, and it was busted. I can't get too in to detail, because I don't know all that much about cars. But in his fury, my husband pulled out his paper to show me all the places he told them to do certain things, and his diagnoses and that they didn't do any of it. There were things he paid for that weren't done, things that were done wrong... etc. etc. etc.  But everyone makes mistakes right? It's all in how it's handled, right? So the husband calls the shop, the OWNER comes TO OUR HOUSE with a lender car and a tow. They totally worked around our schedule to make sure I could pick it up for him while he was working. They threw in a couple freebies, didn't charge for some stuff they could have... they just really went above and beyond to make it right. And that's why they get 5 stars from me. I don't think them messing up is common at all, I think maybe it was a busy day, things got overlooked, or whatever. Nonetheless, the inconvenience was handled wonderfully and we will without a doubt be going back.

Oh my gosh, what is there not to love about Target? Then there's SUPER Target! I love this place. I have gotten groceries, toys, clothes... you name it. And last time I went in, I was asked 2 times if I was finding everything okay. Yes, Mr. Customer Service, I am, thank you :) Always clean, always friendly, never any crackhead employees. Gives me another reason to never have to step foot in to another WalMart (my life long mission). Thank you Super Target, you rock!

This place is great! I feel vip when I get to park in the "family parking" spot because I have the kiddos. It's really nice because when the lot is full, it's great to be close to a sidewalk so when the kids are unstrapped, they can stand out of the way while I gather everything up for the shopping trip.   The security guards in this place are so nice. One of the guys has to have worked there now for years, and he remembers me when I come in. And then they have a sampling area. The guy will sometimes let one of the kids pick out a box of cookies that they think will make the best "sampler". He's always super friendly and willing to help you with suggestions.   There is always a sale section. It's always my first stop. There are lots of premade things that are delicious. It's great for me on those days where I am too overwhelmed to cook, but still want the kids to eat home made food. And their soups... mmm.... try the tortilla. My son likes the California Rolls.  The prices are good, the food is really fresh. It's a little more expensive than fry's with coupons, but it's worth the convenience sometimes.   And they are also very generous with non profits. I really love this store, can't say enough good things about it.

I was very hopeful for this place. I ordered the carne adovada and my honey ordered the stacked enchiladas. He said I should give it a one, but I have definitely experienced worse, overall. The waiter was good, he brought us everything and it was all correct. He only forgot to bring me an extra tortilla, but later remembered toward the end of my meal. And on the topic of that, the tortillas were pretty bad. Definitely mass produced right here in the factories of the good ol US of A. My adovada was chile-y.. is that a word? It tasted just like chile powder. And the enchiladas were nothing to brag about. Honey hated them. No one was overly nice, although the setting was cute. Kids liked their chicken quesadilla. But they're kids. And it's a quesadilla.  I can't bring myself to giving this place any more than a 2 star. Maybe I just had too high of hopes for this place... eh...

Hm... I thought for sure I reviewed this place...  Originally, I had given it less stars due to the limited selection, but it has definitely come a long ways. The selection is phenomenal, the mix of new stuff and old stuff is great. The style is awesome. The customer service is out of this world. I hadn't been there in a year and they remembered me when I walked in the door. Seriously.   They pay good on trade, and I can always find something that rocks. Cool cool place, I hope it stays around for as long as my kids are in kid's clothes! I will be back soon (well, i have to, I just left a bunch of stuff on consignment!)

I love Two Hippies, can I say it enough? I really do, and I swear I'm not just biased. I went to the burger joint and knew that I had to be level headed. I loved the taco shop, the breakfast joint, and the organic pizza.. mm mm mm... so I knew that I had to keep myself from liking this place simply for the name.. But oh... oh oh oh... so good. I'm not a big burger fan, but I got the bacon cheese burger... so good. yum yum. So, like I said, not a big burger fan, so I was thinkin.. maybe I will just give this place a four just based on the fact that I simply love Two Hippies and maybe people would think I was lying. But then I tasted their hot dog. Oh. My. the bacon.. who else didn't know that bacon could come in anything other than strips, all wavey-like? And it was HUGE! Oh, and we can't forget the brown bag of frys. So good. I think they gave us an extra bag by mistake- I'm not sure though, we inhaled them too quickly to notice! Ding Ding, another winner for Two Hippies!

How this place stays afloat is beyond me. It is just so tiny. But in that tiny little space, that man packs a PUNCH of greatness! He is so nice and seems so happy to be there! The cookies are so fresh, and he will tell you his faves. The prices are super reasonable.. you can get a half cookie sandwich! He is not a cheapee, he will let you pay for a small amount, and he even OFFERS it! So sweet to the kids, great Iced tea, my only wish is that this place was bigger. But then he would have to raise his prices and stop offering me half cookie sandwiches that totally hit the spot in all the right places! Super job, sir, I hope you stay around forever!

So me and the hubs had a movie premier to go to and it was in Tempe. We're not the biggest fans of Tempe. Just to lay it out there... there are a lot of douchebags.. and they are in every restaurant, bar, club... squeezed in to corners and crevices.. promise I'm making a point... So we meander in to La Bocca, because it's at the end of Mill and didn't look at all like the other testosterone filled buildings in the area. Boy am I glad we did!! It was so nice! We rarely get to go out.. maybe a couple times a year without the kiddos.. and I would have been super bummed if we wasted our night. We got a cozy corner, on a couch, facing away from the restaurant.. so intimate. And our server was so nice and on top of everything. I had 2 Prickly pear margaritas.. I crave them now! And hubby had 2 beers.. of some sort.. he really liked them. And we split a margarita pizza which the server suggested adding pesto.. great idea! mmm mm mm.. this will definitely be a regular spot for us when we're alone in Tempe. Loved it!

We loved this place. We went just the two of us and were blown away. We initially were going to go to the little burger joint across the way but decided we wanted something a little more special.  We split a dinner for an easy 12 bucks (but the serving is perfect for one.. we wanted to assure room for dessert!) We were walked over to the food area and everything was described to us. I don't eat meat, but tasted a little of the prime rib that my fiancee chose and it was fantastic. The Orozo was unlike anything I have tasted and the asparagus was fantastic. The owner took time to enlighten us with the history of mediterranian culinary culture. This may have seemed excessive at times, but we both decided that it only added to the authenticity of the establishment. All in all, great food, great vibe, exactly what I would want from such a place ;)

We've been here a few times. We've never smoked though. The stuff is cool, they have a neat selection of posters, great deals on oils, and some cool vintage clothes. Their prices are good, nothing is over priced. They have some cool pieces and interesting doo-dads. Don't get me wrong, the guy who works there is incredibly nice. But I don't like the vibe he sets. Lots of negative talk about another shop, I don't know... just kinda overdoes it in the talk department. We will definitely check this place out to have some sheesh and relax. Maybe vip it up in the little loungy area they have which looks really cool.

Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of burgers, or maybe my expectations were just too high... The burger I had here was good, the chicken sandwich was pretty good too. The frozen custard... well.. I've never had frozen custard before, so maybe it was the best, but I didn't think it was any better than an original dairy queen soft serve. The service is rude, in my opinion. It was my first time and they asked what I wanted, so of course, to be easy I say "however it comes" and the response was in a better-than-you, teenage burger snob tone: "well, they COME plain, so you want it plain?" ummm... no. "okay, then I'll take everything" "so you want pickles?" "yes" "mustard and ketchup" "yes" well, if I wanted to do it that way I would have asked you to name off the ingredients... The fries were great and the chili fries were really great, but they still don't hold a candle to my childhood fave- Weinerschnitzels chili fries.. mmm....

Mmmmm... Greek frys anyone?!? I didn't even know what I was missing out on! And the vibe in this place is fantastic, everyone is super friendly. I went in for a to go order and was asked 4 different times if I had been helped or if I could be helped. I was also complimented 3 times while I was there, which is always a plus! lol! The prices were just right. 5 bucks for a humongous to go box of greek frys sounds right up my alley! I need those greek nachos now. I have dreams about them. Too bad they are so far from my house. But I am willing to drive...

I love this place. I am big on saving money at the grocery store and this one does the trick! And I feel like I'm going gourmet! Their fresh soups are amazing.. try the tortilla and if you're sick, the chicken noodle is Heaven. The breads are so good, and even though at regular price they are well over my budget, there is always a sale loaf that is perfect. If not, they have the 88 cent bread at all times. Never crowded, parking spots for me when I have the kids, no lines at check out, amazing taste testers where they even provide some juice to wash it down. The security guard is super nice, I see him there every time I go in. I don't know how you do it, Fresh and Easy, but I like it!!

I took the kids to the Farmers Market with me this weekend and it was a great experience. As soon as we got there, they were handed balloons by one of the vendors, then we trailed around the Market, to get a good idea of what I wanted to purchase. I ended up buying some delicious home made pamegranate jam, followed by a stop at the kiddie korner, where the kids made Valentine's for Daddy. Then, we tried the breads and decided to grab a fresh loaf of 9 grain. Yum! Lots of veggies and fruits later, we have a fridge full of great locally grown snacks and meals. Can't wait to go back!

In a child's fantasy world, all faces are adorned with butterflies and dragons. And possibly glitter. And probably covered in chocolate. But that's beside the point.. Dianne was amazing. She transformed a house full of children in to proud little masterpieces. Her speed was very beneficial in the sense that little kids are very hard to get to sit still for long periods of time. But the kids had no issues, and she was great at conforming to each child's quirks (ie. sticking their fingers in their eyes while she's trying to paint their faces). I would recommend her to anyone, we had such a great time!

I am very familiar with bike shops, and this one is by far the coolest one I have seen.  The bike shop was very organized and had a big variety of accessories and quality bikes. The coffee shop is why we went, and it was fantastic. Definitely the best coffee I have had in a while. My fiancee got the large iced caramel swirl and his only complaint was that he wished he'd ordered 2. I had the americano and was impressed.   The staff, Brian, seemed to have the alter ego of a comfortable, friendly, coffee barista, as well as a knowlegable, down to earth, bike guy. When we stood at the cafe I felt like we were in a cafe. We sat on a couch and played mancala which made for a great Sunday morning.   The place is not like a bike shop with a little half-legit coffee area with packaged doughnuts, it's worth visiting just for the coffee. When you're there, it's like a coffee shop with cool bikes for eye candy. But the bike store is big enough that it can handle all of your tech needs and stocked enough to give you a big selection of products. Will definitely come again, love it!

Well, I can't review this as Lamars, but this place used to be a little sandwich shop with the cutest little train themes. According to my fiancee, it's the same cook, and he will make anything from the old menu. So maybe this is the review for the cook.. but it is absolutely delicious! Try all of them, but my fave is the pulled pork.. don't remember what it was called.. some sort of train name. Mention it, they'll know what yer sprayin'!

I was only here for a bit, so I read the reviews and took them in to consideration. A lot of complaints about the location. I happen to love it. Although, I'm also not wearing a shirt as a dress, fk me pumps, and a gucci purse. And I don't like boys with popped collars and sunglasses.. at 11pm. I like being secluded. If you want to be seen then go party by the stadium, hang out on the patio, and bob your head like an idiot. There are girls that like that. It's ambiance that you have to appreciate here. So don't expect to hear "hey brahh, grab me a jello shooter!" If that sounds like something you would like to hear, then really- why even bother? Lots of parking, awesome patio area, super chill, classy (but not booshie), lots of space.   I specifically went in looking for a location for my "wedding afterparty" And it totally fit the bill. Nayo is Doc's daughter and she showed us around. She was so nice and took the unprepared time to talk to us and make us comfortable. We checked out the swing dancing competition that was totally awesome. I wish we had more time to pull up a chair because the jazz band was tearin it up. But we had to catch a movie.   I'm going to give this a 4 star for now simply because I haven't had enough experience to go for the full 5. But we'll be back this week for a drink. I hope this is the place we choose. And I wish my guys were wearing pinstripes and suspenders.. but it's way too late for me to switch up the wedding attire. All in all, I totally loved it. Will be back to review more later...

awesome, awesome, AWESOME! I experienced Snapbooth for the first time at the Yelp in Bloom event, and it was awesome. They post all the pics on their facebook page right away so you can snag em for free. And at weddings, they actually hand the bride her whole book of family photos before she leaves! This is an amazing company with great values. I've been fortunate enough to meet the owners who are completely family oriented and really sweet. Snapbooth is the perfect thing to have at any event.. it really loosens people up and encourages a great time. No one can come out of the booth without a smile :)

I don't totally get the hype about this place, but it's definitely a pretty cool spot when you're riding your bike and want to stop for some coffee and car watching. My husband and I stopped here the other day, I got a delicious flavored tea and he got a yummy flavored coffee. They have a stamp program, and that's nice. The people are always super friendly. I once got a number passed to me by the barista from a guy at the opposing window. I don't think he saw my kids standing next to me because they're shorter than the window.. but I was flattered nonetheless. :)

This place was very cute and friendly. I got some sort of weird, scottsdale, vibe for some reason.. I guess I just expected that downtown phoenix feel that I'm so used to around here! But it was good, got my sweet heart some old fashioned candy cigarettes, and my little ones each got to pick some candy out as well. The prices are very fair. I'm sure I will be back soon, it's a very cool local spot!

Ahh! I went here one day and took a whole 2 hours to go back again! This place was great! I found curtains for my house for a whopping 12 bucks!! (for both panels) And books, games, the whole shebang! Yeah, I agree with Jessica on wanting to save this little secret of mine.. but man oh man! I spent so many hours at antique stores and totally neglected the real deal! Definitely recommended.. or not recommended... if you're going for any size 6s!

What's with all the negative reviews? We loved this place! We took our two little ones with us and hung out outside while we waited for our food. Of course we received the best customer service ever, it IS Two Hippies, after all... We ordered a $7 greek pizza (what a STEAL!) and the same priced pepperoni for the kiddos. The Greek pizza was A-mazing. Toppings galore with no skimping on the chicken. And the kids loved the pepperoni pizza. Will definitely make this a regular stop, it definitely beats Little Caesars! Can't wait for the Breakfast Joint to open!   Okay, so I thought I should update my review since I have tried so much more of the menu now. *Pepperoni - always a classic, tastes great *Chinese - surprisingly good, crunchy (i didn't expect that!)  *Greek - still my fave. *Cheeseburger - k, i didn't think I'd like this one but I really did. I wouldn't have expected to like the pickle. But it actually tasted really good, there was only one on the slice I had and I didn't expect it. *Feta and Bacon - YUM! ok, i need to try the greek again, this one might be my new fave. The feta is so good on the pizza.. and bacon.. yum So they have won me over 100% I can't wait to try the mediteranean!  Oh, and one more thing to those people who keep complaining about the 1.50 atm fee.. they don't charge tax.. so don't you think that makes up for it?? Or you could.. just bring cash! C'mon people, super cheap, tastes great, no tax.. does anything make you happy?!

This place is... different.  I can't say enough about those bathrooms, they're pretty cool. If you go there, you have to check out the bathrooms.  There were doughnuts on the bar one night when we went. That was awesome. We had the same bartender both times we've gone. She was really great, we loved her. I wish I remembered her name....  The place is cool, there are couches to sit on which are super comf. The stadium seating by the dance floor is cool too. This place is all around cool, just maybe not our "type" of crowd. Though they were mostly nice, and way better than your typical scottsdale douchy bar goers. Whatever they were going for when they set this up, I think they got there. It really is a beautiful little bar.

Yay! It opened!! We were waiting for QUITE a while!!  So first off, the staff is amazing, a norm for the Two Hippies.. Always friendly faces, super layed back style. The owner's there hanging out, and genuinely interested in feedback and criticism. No criticism here though, we thought this place was amazing.  It's always easy to bring the kids to a Two Hippies Joint, and this place is no exception. My two little ones shared an apricot jam toast sandwich that came with potatoes.. soo good! I got the breakfast bowl and chose from one of the million toppings they offer. Now I worked at Denny's for 3 years and adored the meatlover's skillet.. and this is that- to the super extreme, personalized, deliciousness. Oh my gosh. I got bacon, sundried tomatoes, chorizo, green onion, chopped garlic, and cheddar cheese... all teamed with 3 eggs, some breakfast potatoes, and I threw on some hot sauce.... heaven. It also comes with thick toast- my favorite kind. Hubs got the three brothers. Not what he expected, but super good. I really liked their tuna salad sandwich. It also comes with an egg salad sandwich and a chicken salad sandwich. They are not mini, so don't be fooled by the description. That came with a nice little salad. Very good. Of course we had to get a lemonade, guava.. fantastic, but I prefer the strawberry. The pomegranate is really good too! I loved the flavored iced tea. I got the passion fruit, but I like the peach better, but they didn't have it. I've had it at their pizza place, it's really good. We also got a bottled water.  All of that for a total of 22.00, and we left very happy (and full) customers. You can't get that at McDonalds! (and WHY would you want to.. ick) Also, the cash thing kinda sucks, but they have an atm right there next to the register.  I would recommend this place to anyone in the area, they really do a nice job representing the neighborhood. Very much like the people in the area, the place is super chill and you never feel out of place. Another winner, Two Hippies!

We didn't go in to Hula's for a while because it was right next to the booshy coffee shop and we just don't ever seem to feel comfortable around those crowds. But one day, when we had the night to ourselves, we decided to do a little bar hopping around the 'hood. I am DYING to try the volcano, let me just start with that! We had some good, pretty drinks at good prices, and a basket of sweet potato fries, which were on the house since the waiter forgot about us. GREAT service, btw. We went back a while later with my sister and her boyfriend who loved it. I'm sure we'll be back again as soon as we have another night on our own. Or maybe we'll go with the kids. The set up is awesome, it's 1/2 outdoor which is perfect with the kids, and there's an outdoor firepit and some bike racks. Can't wait to try this place again. I honestly have no complaints.

This place has gone downhill. At least at night it goes down hill. Where are these people coming from? Geeze, I feel like I walked in to an episode of Jersey Shore. Blegh. The food is still pretty good, the volcano bowl is disgusting but worth the try. Hubs and I went one night just to hang out. It's so cramped. You are sitting on top of everyone around you. The good part of that is we had some good laughs at some RIDICULOUS conversations that were happening around us. I won't be visiting this place at night ever again. I may hit up Hula for some mimosas though. This place is much better for a nice brunch than it is for a night out.

I've been here once, because my hours are not quite "bakers hours".. but it was really really good. The service reminded me of being back home in my small town. Hubby had turkey on marble rye and I had a bagel sandwich. Both delicious. Service was fantastic. Don't live on this side of town anymore, but this is definitely a gem worth visiting.

I've been to Rips a few times. It's right down the street from my house- stumbling distance. The time we went with our rockabilly friends was a lot of fun. We danced all night to the bands, and I was too plastered to realize how many people were smooshed in to that little bar. There was a near-fight between my friend's husband and a big guy who was not leaving my friend alone. So of course, there's that...  On other occasions, I've gone and it was just way too crowded. It was like this "EXCUSE ME!!! EXCUSE MEEEE!! CAN I GET A JACK AND COKE PLEASE?? NO, JACK!! YEAH!! AND COKE!! A JACK AND COKE!!" I'm not a huge fan of screaming, really. Well, usually. ;)  Anywho, this place is good for a rowdy rockabilly/punk sorta crowd. A little too intense for my innocent looking self and low key husband. I'd like to check it out on a Thursday some time. And I'm always seeing something advertised for Wednesdays, although we've never checked it out. Maybe some day.

I went here with some work friends and was surprised at the nice atmosphere of the place. We sat outside, and I brought my 7 year old with me. The soft pretzel was delicious, the service was great, and the crowd was cool. It's a little too 'chainey' for me, but I would definitely go back if I lived in the area.

After looking through thousands of pictures from TONS of photographers, my fiancee (and now husband) and I decided on Chadwick for his extemely creative style, and the way he seemed to capture the different feels of each wedding. So we expected the photos to be amazing. And oh. my. gosh. I've heard "these look like they are straight out of a magazine!" from about 98% of the people who have seen them.   Okay, so I said I expected them to be awesome. What I didn't expect, however, was how incredibly personal he was about everything. He took the time to get a good feel of my husband and I, and captured our "us" to a TEE! Looking back at the photos, I don't even remember seeing him there, he was so discreet, not like the photographers you see flailing themselves all over the place rudely in front of everyone. I felt like he cared as much about my day as I did!  I would recommend Chadwick to anyone. He's very professional, talented, and just an all around kind-hearted person.

This Pita Jungle was good. We went for the reverse happy hour. Well, what happened was we didn't know about the reverse happy hour until we got there. It starts at 9 and we got there at a little after 8. So we went for a walk around the neighborhood first to burn off some of those calories we were about to tack on and to kill some time. The walk was fun. The neighborhood is awesome. It doesn't feel like Phoenix at all. We even saw a big boat.  After the walk, we perused back over to the joint. I don't know if they had drink specials, we didn't drink that night. I had an iced tea and homemade lemonade. I think it's homemade. It tasted like it. I was impressed. I LOVE my Arnold Palmers. I would consider going there just for a big drink to go. I had the felafel, my husband had the chicken shwarma. The pita bread was a little hard and the felafel was a little dry. I don't know if maybe it was because it was the end of the night? We also had the hummus trio and the garlic dip. Both were delicious. But again, the pita bread was kind of dry. We couldn't decide which hummus we liked best. I think my vote is for the original. My husband was all over the tomato.  The service was pretty good, although she only came back to our table once. But again, that's probably because it was the end of the night, I think she was doing her side work. Luckily we didn't need anything. It was pretty busy for 9 oclock, I was surprised. We were no where near the last ones out of there. I don't know if we'll ever go back to Pita Jungle. I'd like another drink, but other than that, it didn't leave me craving more.

WOWWWWWWWW  Seriously, wow. We took the kids here one night when we were looking for someplace good to eat. We were going to go to America's but we used to live there, so we tried this place out instead. It's right down the road, so we were like "what the hey." Firstly, the outside is so cool looking. With that big ol sugar skull thing. So artsy. I was a little nervous we'd be out of place. But then we thought... "well, it's not in the nicest area, so it can't be too scenester" SO glad we made that decision. So we go in with the kids and sit at a table. The seating area is very intimate, I didn't mind that. The decor is really cool, gotta love a place with a great ambiance! The server was really nice, not overly nice. He did a great job. Omg the salsa bar is amazing. We tried them all! The kids loved trying them and naming them. The cilantro salsa.... never had anything like it in my life.   I had the fish tacos that were such a relief. I have had some bad fish tacos in the past so I was a little nervous. But wow. We also had a margarita. They were both strong so I got to finish my husbands. Yay for me! :)   I was a little disappointed that there isn't a kid's menu. I think they should make a small taco plate for kids, and maybe an option for a small burrito with a side of beans and rice. But the kids made due just fine. My daughter had a bean and cheese burrito and my son had 2 of the carne tacos. They both loved their choices and my husband swapped a carne taco with one of my Son's fish so they got to try it all. Yum. The chips were also great and made it nice to be able to dive right in to all the salsa options.   The price might be my favorite thing. All four of us ate, got drinks, and my husband and I had a margarita all for about 40 bucks including a nice tip. You really can't beat that! We will DEFINITELY be going back to La Condesa!

Wow, I can't believe how bad my first review was! i'm glad I went through to read my past reviews, because this one was way off. Maybe it was my secret plan to keep people from crowding our spot!  We bring everyone here! The tortillas are great, the service is amazing, and I've never had anyone tell me they didn't love it. Their cochata is amazing, and my personal favorite is the vegetarian quesadilla. yum!

We bought the Yelp deal for a night of fun with the 2 kiddos, the husband, and I.   From the outside, this place looks pretty shady. But that did not stop us! We went in and were greeted fairly quickly by the front desk guy. The place was pretty dead, but it was a Thursday, so it was kind of expected. We had 2 lanes, one for us, one for the kids, and a pitcher of beer between the 2 of us. For the price, it was a great night, and something we'll definitely be doing again.

I can't believe I haven't rated this place yet! Mmmmmm... Joe's food is so good.   First, the place is attached to an old garage. Which is super super cool. The whole place is well decorated, the theme is really fun. The first time we went, it was great. The second time we went, we met Joe! He came over to the table and chatted for a bit. Very cool. The kids always have a good time here. The prices are very fair.   We've had a little of everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. I just love this little local spot.

These guys were great. Prompt service, very friendly and did a great job. I only needed one room done, and I was on an EXTREMELY tight schedule for the day. These guys worked around my schedule so I could get them in and out and handle the rest of my errands for the afternoon. They got out all the spots in my son's room, and left it looking brand new.  I will definitely be calling these guys again in a few weeks when the carpet needs a re-clean!

OMG homemade ice cream! *drool*  This place is delicious. A friend took me and my two little kids and we were all very pleased. I think I had some sort of cheesecake flavored ice cream. The shop is so cute. And the have pretzel cones!! I can't write anymore about this place because my mouth is starting to water and they're not open yet...

The crescent ballroom is awesome. I went once with my husband to a hip hop show, and I loved the way it was set up. We hung out outside for a while, loved seeing everyone who walked up right in front. The restaurant section is cool, we want to go some time during the day. The drinks were really reasonable and the bartender was great. The venue is a good size, and everything was set up really well.  I went one other time for a private event, which I did not know about previously. They had the restaurant and venue part shut off from each other and the guest's at the event didn't even realize there was another side.  I would definitely book this place up if I needed an awesome location and wanted to hire a live band to play. It was perfect.

YUMMMM  this is the food of my dreams. I'm a vegetarian, so it's hard to find places that are meat free as well as tofu and mushy eggplant free. This place hit the spot.  Cauliflower soup... omg. Delicious. I talk about it still. I had the strawberry salad and soup combo. It was an easy 8 bucks. My sister and Mom had some other stuff, I was way too proccupied with my delicious soup to give notice. And it came with a dipped strawberry. heaven.  Is this place a chain? It is such a good chain if it is. Everything was great. My only complaint is that they're closed on Sundays. I hate establishments that are closed on Sundays, I think it's dumb. I drove my whole family here one Sunday afternoon, all excited to introduce my husband to the delicious selection and they were closed. ugh. We're going tomorrow. Maybe that will ease my bitterness of the Sunday thing and cause an extra star to be added.. we will see.

The husband and I stopped in here last night for some drinks before grocery shopping. It was a good time.  When we arrived at 4pm, it was really dead. We were pretty much the only ones in there. But they let us know right away that we were just in time for happy hour (woohoo!). So we each ordered a drink (he had a beer and then a specialty coffee, I had 3 spiked arnold palmers). The drinks were fantastic! Our waitress was also the bartender, which was cool. We also ordered a couple soft pretzels to start us off. OMG they were good! Super soft with 2 different delicious dipping sauces. Soooo good. Then, we ordered a veggie burger on a pretzel bun and split it. It was big, the waitress put it on two plates for us, we didn't even ask! Super sweet of her. It comes with ketchup and two other sauces. I think one was a cucumber sauce, and the other was just delicious. I have no idea what it is.  We hung out and people watched for a few hours. There was some good people watching to be had. The place was pretty mellow, and right down the street from our house. I'm hesitant to put more great details because I really like this place and don't want it to blow up. lol But I will say, we will definitely be going again.

We go here at the end of almost every month after class. It's a good time, everyone is always friendly, the staff is really accommodating to our group, and someone is always around to offer wing sauce samples.   I feel a little weird giving 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but I've never had any problems here, they've never gotten our order wrong, we've never even had to wait for seats!

It was our  wedding anniversary and the kids were at Grandma's. It was a Wednesday night. We were both finally off work, it was 8pm, and we wanted to try to fit in a little date to celebrate another year down. I was in the mood for pizza, so of course, we turn to Yelp. We wanted somewhere good, but not good enough to require me to get all fancied up. The reviews looked promising, so we said "what the hey.."  The weather was just chilly enough to not want to sit outside. We couldn't find the entrance, so we walked a circle around the entire building. It was a nice walk. We got to assess (and by assess I mean "gossip about") some couples on the patio. That was fun. Walked in, greeted right away by a nice lady. Sat at a table by the patio door. The view was nice. The bar was pretty. The crowd was a little bit hipster, a little bit normal people. It looked like there were a lot of first dates happening. Those are fun to watch.  The server was super sweet, I love that they're all wearing normal clothes.   The food was pretty good. We got some sort of appetizer, I forgot what it was called as soon as I ordered it. It looked like a whole bunch of fried stuff all piled together (not greasy gross fried, just fried), with 2 different dipping sauces. One green, one red. The red was better. For an entree, we shared a pizza. It was okay. We got the Big Star because all the others looked a little too weird (apple and sausage?... hmm) For dessert, we had doughnuts with the chocolate sauce. We got them because they make a similar dessert at Olive Garden, and we are obsessed with them. Well... I hate to say this, because I love small businesses, but olive garden's doughnut and chocolate sauce is a lot better. So it was a huge disappointment, but that's not necessarily their fault. Our expectations were probably too high. We also split a pitcher of beer. The total bill was 40 bucks plus tip. Not too shabby.  When we left, like, 5 employees smiled and said "bye!! thanks for coming in!!" Where did they find such pleasant people? I like it.
