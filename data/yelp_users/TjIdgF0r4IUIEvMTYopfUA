The food here is great, amazing breakfast. Only thing wrong is picking up an order. When you call in and place an order for pick up, and they tell you 15 mins Over the phone. I am realistic, normally expect 15-30 when slightly busy, and I am a very patient person but when it takes almost and hour for 3 breakfast items, it becomes and issue. This is unsat, I would expect better service than what happened today.

let me simply start off by this place is way better then paradise bakery. The food portions are great along with the quality. I ordered the turkey pastrami, and it was delicious. Even though it looked packed, i quickly ordered my food, and the wait was just right. The service, the atmosphere was just right. I have no negative comments about this place. I will return to try other things on their menu, and im looking forward to another visit.

This is very upsetting, the customer service has been terrible the past few weeks. Order food for pick up, and only 1 of 3 orders were correct. Very disappointed in the customer service here, now you have to figure out if you order something and pick it up, you are going to have to double check before you leave. If they keep this up they wont have a busy lunch and then they can most likely get the orders right by then.

Start off by saying this place is well worth it. Ordered some shrimp and the 5.2 lbs lobster. It comes with a handy rock and scissors. If you want a good hashtag this one deserves #nomnomnom. Will be back again soon.
