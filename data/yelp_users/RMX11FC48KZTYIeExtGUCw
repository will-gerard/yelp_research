Argh! I just realized I never reviewed this place, and it's been a while since I've been there. So I shall have to rely on the lasting impressions.  I had the plato tipico, which I think translates as, "giant plate heaped with fried deliciousness."  In fact, the pictures posted here are actual photo documentation of what I had, while dining with Brian G.  The yucca fries were utterly divine -- crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, slightly sweet throughout. The pupusas, pure awesomness (and I've had my share, believe it or not). The empanadas, pretty tasty, but not mind-blowing. The tamale, I could have lived with out.  Thank god it's not closer, of I'd eat there every day, and undo all my hard work at the gym.

We went for an early dinner on Saturday, and loved it. Service was top notch, atmosphere was comfortable and quaint, without being cute. The food was delicious and well executed. Since it was happy hour, the drinks were $2 off too.  We started with the indecision bruscetta. It's a plate of two each of their three varieties. I tried the goat cheese and the gorgonzola ones. Both were quite tasty, and a perfect start to the meal. Though the pine nuts kept falling off of the gorgonzola one. I also have a glass of a lovely Chilean cab.  I ordered the halibut tacos. I had been craving a grilled fish taco, and was stoked they had them on the menu. The halibut was tasty and delicate, topped with an almost too mild chipotle slaw, nestled in grilled flour tortillas. I felt it needed a little something, so I added a squeeze of lime, and a touch of salt.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee. The texture was the perfect combination of creamy and firm, and it was swimming with the tiny grains of vanilla bean.  Dinner was also reasonably priced. For a party of five, our bill was about $150 for one app, one salad, five entrees, one wine, three cocktails, and two desserts.  I would go back in a heatbeat.

My girlfriend and I were "regulars" at Oak Creek Brewery, when we lived up North. Once we moved down here, we started pining for the brewery scene. We gave Sonora brewhouse a shot.  Granted, our expectations are very high. OCB is THE social hub for the locals. We knew we weren't going to find the same thing here, being that Phoenix has so many cool haunts available.  What we were looking for was a good patio, good beer, and a good atmosphere. Sonora Brewhouse delivers on all counts. The good food was a bonus. It's not great food, but it'll do. We've learned to stick to a few select items.   The chips and salsa are wonderful. If you're lucky, the flour tortilla chips will still be warm. They are fluffy, light, and delicately crisp. The salsa is the traditional smooth style, with just the right amount of heat.   The other go-to food item is the American Kobe beef burger. It is so juicy, so flavorful and delicious. It's big enough to share, if you're more interested in sampling the beer, but want a snack to keep you going -- which is my usual strategy.  I'm not really wowed by the beers. I think I have tried four or five of them, and of those, only two stood out for me. The seasonal vanilla porter is lovely and luscious, like a creme brulee in a pint glass - but without overdoing it. Typically, I am a dark beer drinker, but the Light Rail Cream Ale won me over. For a light beer, it has surprising amounts of body and flavor. One could easily wile away a warm Winter's afternoon kicking those back.  As for the atmosphere, it is casual, but I wouldn't say friendly. I've been there probably six or seven times, and haven't had a single conversation with a stranger.   Also, they play great music -- if you can hear it! Often, I can make out faint notes of Janis Joplin or the Doors. I'm told that the patio speakers are as loud as they can get. Too bad.

One day, I was craving something light and healthy, and this place seemed just the ticket. Trying to avoid the Camelback construction, I wended my way through a residential area, and lucked out on a sweet parking spot.  I didn't really have the time or desire to eat there, so I grabbed a menu and placed an order to go -- the seared tuna, and some soba noodles. And I waited. And waited.   For the record, there is no waiting area, per se. I just stood around by the door, kind of looming over some poor guy's table. I explained to at least 4 different groups, that I was not waiting for a table, and they could go ahead of me. When my food was finally ready, I quickly paid and bolted out the door.  In the comfort of my cube, I unwrapped the goods. The tuna looked lovely, a good shade of red, nicely seasoned crust, presented on a bed of greens, with a soy-based sauce on the side. It tasted fantastic as well. The noodles were rather plain, the broth unremarkable, but not bad.  I would definitely go back, but would phone in my order first, or dine there.

I just had to chime in with Dave to balance out the ratings on this place. It was some of the boringest (is that a word), blandest pizza ever. I've had better frozen pizzas.  Not only that, the one time I ate there, the dining room was cold as the Grinch's heart, and there was a REALLY-LOUD-TALKING lady there, whose voice boomed throughout the entire establishment.

I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment, they also rent heaps of tools and equipment. Think hedge trimmers, lawn aerators, cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project, and so, don't want to invest in the equipment.  In our case, we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter's freeze, an unwelcome sapling, a dead tree, branches encroaching the roof, and to tame some monstrous oleanders.  I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.  The process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.  Pro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm. You can return it Monday morning, and only be charged for one day (Saturday), since they are closed on Sunday.

Love Sunset Bowl. Love it!  With it's kooky retro neon, and Crumb-esque murals, it's a funky change from the cookie-cutter AMFs out there.   For a bowling alley bar, the bar is pretty good! It's really nice, and has great prices.  The weekend "Boogie Bowl" is fun too. It used to be, they laid out a huge binder full of song titles, and you just wrote down the numbers for each song you wanted to hear.   Then the lady punched them into a machine that played the music. That system created an incredibly diverse playlist.  However, last time we went, there was going to be a DJ. We left before he got there, so I don't know if he's any good. In the meantime, they let us do the song list thing!  I'm only deducting a star because there is no longer a restaurant there. I was so counting on some chili cheese fries to fuel my bowling.

I have a theory about waiting areas. The nicer they are, the more you're going to pay. Judging by that at Toyo Motors, I was prepared to grab my ankles when the bill came, and I was pretty much spot on.  For a while, I took my ride to various shops around town to get the real-deal on what needed to be done to it, maintenance-wise. I must say, ToyoMotors did a very thorough, and accurate assessment, without a lot of extra BS. They laid out exactly what needed to be done, and in what order.  If I had more money, I would have totally gone with them. Unfortunately, I did not. Since that time, I've had my rig worked on a few times, and the work done was pretty much exactly what they suggested needed doing.  ToyoMotors isn't ridiculously expensive, just more than I can swing, because I'm perpetually poor. I figure you're paying for quality though. So if you've got the dough, and you've got a Toyota you love, check 'em out!

It's usually against my policy to review places that have been yelped to death. But in this case, I had to make an exception.   I just got back to my desk, after consuming the most divine beef machaca burro that ever existed. Wow. The only reason I'm taking a star off, is because the atmosphere is like that of someone's garage.

They have aftermarket radiators for just about every vehicle. And if they don't have it at this location, they'll get it from one of the others the same or next day. I got a new one for my Land Cruiser for about $120, and it's hella stout. I expect it to last a good long  time.

I'm so glad by appointment with Nationwide got FUBARed. Had it not, I wouldn't have ended up at Dr. Schrolucke's.   From the time I set my appointment, to the time I paid my tab, the staff was so friendly and nice, even good for a few laughs. The doc himself seems to be a down-to-earth kind of guy, and I felt entirely comfortable throughout the whole exam.  Their office isn't the sleekest or most modern. But it's comfortable and clean. I didn't have to wait very long for my turn, and the whole exam went rather quickly.   Best of all, they didn't try to sell me some glasses I didn't need. Gotta love that kind of honesty.

We were starving on a late Sunday afternoon, and looking for an alternative to Streets of NY. I came across an ad for Nino's in the weekly circular, saw that they deliver, and decided to give it a shot.  But when I called to place my order, they said that the driver wasn't there yet. Bummer, but I understand. It was a weird time to ask for delivery.  Nonetheless, the place is close enough and my curiosity was sufficiently piqued. I placed an order for a large pizza and some wings for pick up. Turnaround time was 20 minutes, which is way better than the time that Streets gives me.  I rolled into their shop, and was pleased to see that 3 or 4 of their tables were occupied -- a good sign. Most folks were enjoying wings and beer and watching the TVs humming dully with baseball commentary. The place was dimly lit, with memorabilia on the walls. Nice and cozy.  After a few minutes, I was presented with a piping hot sausage pizza and a dozen crispy delicious wings. I whisked the goods home, and the whole family tucked in like a pack of coyotes.  The crust had the perfect chewy to crisp ratio. The sauce, perfectly spicy / sweet, and it was topped with gobs of stringy cheese, and ground sausage.   The wings were done the traditional style with Frank's and butter, and wonderfully crispy. The "hot" variety was just right for us. But they have something like 10 different varieties and levels available.  Price-wise, it was comparable to Streets. Taste-wise, I'd rate it a little higher. But given the choice, I would certainly rather support a smaller local operation, and will definitely be ordering from Nino's again.

This review is based entirely on their cosmic bowling.  Holy mother of God, this place had to have had the most random and diverse selection of music and bowlers on the planet! It was entertaining, inspiring and perplexing all at once.  Each lane was populated by a different set of folks. Black kids on 10, suburban white family on 13, emos on 9, Messicans on 5, and our lane - two lezbos and a teen boy. The whole place was almost an exact cross-section of my neighborhood.  And the music! Some hip hop, then fluffy pop or some such, then a Norteño ballad, a country tune, some 80s music, an old dance club anthem. It was utterly schizophrenic.  I liked it. And hated it. I don't even know anymore.  Once the "family" lady behind the bar started serving up the drinks, I just didn't care anymore. It was just plain fun. Plus I bowled an excellent game.

Typical shady auto repair place, staffed by under experienced techs. They spent way too long working on my brakes, and then didn't even tighten the caliper bolts all the way. I had one pling out a couple weeks after the service. I ended up having it towed to another shop at my own expense, since I don't trust them to work on something as vital as my brakes.  And to Michael C. - it was definitely this location, and see how YOU feel when you're driving along and all of a sudden one side of your brakes clamp down and you come to halt in the middle of traffic.

I'm adding another star, because the owner, Howard, has really gone out of his way to make things right. To the point that I'm willing to give them another shot. Hopefully, after that, I'll be able to add more stars.

After that last fiasco at Great Clips, I was a bit gun-shy about getting my hair cut at a new place again. But a good friend of mine has been going to Hair'z 2 U, to get her funky cool hair style done, and it looked great. Not only that, this place is like 1/10th of a mile from my house.  In typical Phoenix fashion, the salon is located in a nondescript strip mall. Inside, they did a really fine job of making it inviting, and almost luxurious. My stylist, Susan, had a friendly, engaging personality, and took plenty of time to ask questions, ask me how she was doing, and refer back to the pictures I brought.   She managed to salvage my hair style, and make it something lovely. I'll certainly go back once it grows out some, so she can finish the job, and heck, maybe even get some color too.

Now that I have a little more experience in jewelry making and bead shopping, I can say that A 2 Z isn't all that. Every time I go, they don't have what I'm looking for.   Not only that, they watch me, as if I'm trying to steal something.

It's not the swankiest animal hospital. But the vets and staff are really nice and knowledgeable. Their rates aren't bad either.  In addition, it happens to be an emergency facility. We had to bring both our dogs here for emergencies on separate occasions, and they got right in, even during off hours. There is an extra fee attached though, I think around $50.  I also like that they don't try and sell you a bunch of tests and meds that your pet likely won't need. They often employ the "wait and see" approach, which usually works for the best.  Plus, they call the day after you come in, to check in on your pet. How nice is that?

After being dissatisfied by my GP's diagnosis, I decided to take matters into my own hands, and head to a specialist. My insurance's provider directory led me to Dr. Isabel Feinstein.   I really just picked blindly, but ended up lucking out. On my appointment day, I had a very short wait, before Dr. Feinstein strode into the waiting room to meet me.  I hate to use the term "spunky," but that she was. She was a bit short, and had kind of crazy salt and pepper hair, tiny, old-fashioned tortoiseshell glass, and insisted that I call her "Izzy."  Now, I've never been to an ENT before. In the exam room was a big, scary looking machine, armed with all sorts of wands, probes, lights, and brushes. I was not feeling secure about this whole thing.  However, Izzy put me at ease, asked me lots of questions about why I was there, and my history. Even having those wands and lights jammed down my throat and up my nose wasn't all that bad. It wasn't exactly a day at the spa. But it wasn't horrible.  I'm only withholding a star because I'm not 100% satisfied with my answer. But apparently less care is actually better for you, the studies say. That fact doesn't quell my anxiety levels, however.

Eh. As I may have mentioned in previous reviews, for me, the bar for Thai food is set by Thai Hut. Erawan ain't even close.  First off, the place is dank. Like they built it in the basement of some 1960's ranch house. The carpet is funky -- not like fun-KAY -- but like ew, funky.  I do give them props for friendly and attentive service. But the food, is just OK. The fried apps are really greasy, and the accompanying sauces are so straight-out-of-the-jar.  The entrees, not much better. The pad kee mao was really oily, and despite the "spicy" warning, was exceedingly tame, as if they dumbed it down for us. Plus the portion size was really small, and they skimped on the noodles. Oh, and they charge for soda refills.   We just felt nickel and dimed for a skimpy, boring meal. Not like we expect huge Buca di Beppo like portions -- just enough so that you aren't starving 20 minutes later.

I think the previous reviews pretty much covered everything. I just wanted to add that the octopus salad was really tasty and tender. Of course, the ahi sushi was top grade as well. I will be back, for sure!

Honestly, my memory is a bit dusty, regarding this place. I have eaten there twice, but it was a while ago. I do remember this important fact, however: so far, it is my favorite bbq in the Valley.  The exterior of the building has an incongruous 50s diner look to it. Rather different for a barbeque restaurant. The first thing you notice when you enter, are the pigs. They are everywhere -- ceramic ones, wooden ones, stuffed ones -- you name it. Lots and lots of knickknacks, and bright green walls.  In addition to fountain beverages, you can also get alcoholic beverages and bottled sodas. This was great for me, because I could get Diet Dr. Pepper.   The portions are generous, but not ridiculous. Their cornbread is of the sweet variety, if that matters to you. You can tell that they paid attention to how their sides were prepared, rather than treating them as an afterthought. It's not often that I comment, "wow that's good grilled zucchini!" They also make a damn fine sweet potato.  I know what you're waiting for.... the barbeque. I'll start with the least impressive, the brisket. It was a touch dry, and meh in flavor. No bad, not great. The pulled pork and ribs however, were awesome. Just the right combo of sweet, spicy, sour, and smoky. My one qualm with the ribs was that they were a bit fatty.  I didn't get dessert, but I tasted my companions' dessert -- the peach cobbler that the menu talks up. It comes in a big sundae goblet, which I think makes the crust rather mushy and slimey. Plus, if you don't like spice, you won't like it. It was overwhelmingly gingery / allspicey.  So far, I have tried Honey Bear's, PHX BBQ (formerly Tom's), Restaurant 28, and Famous Dave's. Though there is room for improvement, and barbeque tastes are so subjective, Thee Pitts still ranks the best for me.

I'm a bit of a noob gardener. So I need all the help I can get. Fed up with the no-nothing drones at those big box home improvement stores, I sought out a local nursery for my gardening needs. That's how I came to Summer Winds.  I've driven by it many times on my dreaded weekend shopping trips along the Bell Road gauntlet, and never thought much of it. Whizzing by, it looks like not much more than a roadside stand.  But if you make your way inside, it unfolds like, dare I say, a blossom. It's comprised of room after room, patio after patio of plants, pots, supplies, and decor. I spent nearly an hour just wandering around.   All I needed was something organic to battle the bugs munching on my lettuces. I brought in some sample leaves and soil. The woman told me I had cabbage loopers, and a mold problem. Apparently, I'm over-watering. She also directed me to the appropriate treatment solution.  Beat that, orange-aproned dolts!  Oh, and keep an eye out for the kittehs wandering throughout the property. I counted at least four.

Fuzzy's serves up Chicago-style thin crust pizza, and does it well. I've hit them up for a pie a couple of times now, and have been super-pleased. The crust is light and crisp, the sauce is nice and tomatoey, and the amount and quality of toppings just right.  My only issue is that sometimes they are a bit slow. I rationalize this by assuming that they are making my pizza fresh, and that takes a little time.  Also, the wings are pretty tasty too. There were lots of drummies in the mix, and I like that.

My eye appointment was a total FAIL. I spent the day home, sick, and doped up on decongestants. Around 5:45 or so, I was in my jammies, has just made a cup of tea, and ready to crawl back into bed. Then it hit me. I had a 5:30 appointment.  I freaked out a little and scrambled around trying to find the phone number. I finally found it, called, apologized profusely, and asked if it was still possible for me to come in, or should I just reschedule.  They said, sure you can still come in if you can be here in 7 minutes. I said I certainly could, since I live nearby.  So I threw on some clothes, grabbed my keys, ran out the door, jumped in my hoopty, careened around the block, broke a few minor traffic laws, and was at their desk at 5:56.  I addressed the first woman behind the desk, and told her that I was there for my 5:30, sorry I'm late, etc etc. She said that she didn't see me in their appointments. I was confused by this, and asked if this is the office I've been talking with on the phone. This is when the other woman chimed in, and said, "yes this is the office, but it's 6pm at the doctor can't see you now. But we can schedule you for tomorrow."  That would have been fine, if she told me that before I dropped everything and risked life and limb to get there in time. I realize I effed up by forgetting my appointment, and being late. But they should've been straight with me from the get-go, and just told me it was too late, and that we should just reschedule.  So I told them, "nevermind," and left. I'll go somewhere else.

Having recently moved to the neighborhood, I'm on the prowl for a new pizza place. I was looking for one that delivered, but Pullano's is close enough for pick up, and I read good things about it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I probably should have stuck with pizza. But we were in the mood for a full, homestyle meal. We ordered a veal parmesan, a chicken parmensan, two wedding soups, and a burger for the kid.   The fact that they had burgers should have been a minor warning sign. The fact that they also have a full Mexican food menu should have been a great big honkin' neon sign.  Like most places in the Valley, Pullano's is tucked in a shabby strip mall. Inside, it's very cheery and friendly. The walls are chocked full of sports memorabilia from the local teams they support, as well as some knickknacks, and TVs airing sports. It's been around a while, and that made it rather comfortable and neighborhoody.  The staff was all smiles, and after a short wait, had my food ready to go. The price for our meal was around $30. Not bad.  Once I got it home and unwrapped it, well, yeah. The veal parm was one of those chopped and re-formed patties, dowsed in a bland tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella. The chicken was an actual chicken breast, served in the same way, but had the texture of a dog's chew toy (not that I've actually tried one.)  On a bright note, the italian wedding soup was really rather good. In fact, we have toyed with the idea of ordering from Pullano's again -- but just soup and garlic bread. Or maybe a pizza.

For classic cuts and clipper work, this place is the real deal. Jacob is incredibly precise and pays attention to detail. I'm always bringing in pictures of the looks I'm going for, and he nails it every time. Also, if you, like me, are a woman who likes cuts traditionally for men, he has no problem creating those styles for you, with zero judgement or weirdness. Prices are incredible fair as well.

So, we rolled in here one night, basically, because we were already a bit tipsy, and it was close to the house. I was a bit nervous, because it seems to me, every time I drive by, there are cop cars outside.  Imagine my surprise, when we entered, to find the place was a) jam-packed b) with indians, and c) playing good music (if you like Journey).   As we spent some more time there, we also found that the crowd was really friendly -- at least to us -- apparently the cops cars are there often because of fights. We chatted up everyone around us, and they, us. Bonus, the drinks were dirt cheap.  I'm glad we had the liquid courage to take that chance. Now we have a cool neighborhood bar to stop by that's near home.

I've avoided this place so long. Because I was afraid. The exterior and location just made me think it was full of sketchy people doing sketchy things that I didn't want to be a part of.   However, get a few drinks in me, and I'm up for (just about) anything. After snacks and several beverages at Jaded, my girlfriend and I were headed back to the Westside to call it a night. But as we drove, the itch to keep rolling on through the night persisted.  Since the Water Hole / Daddy's / whatever they were last calling it when it went straight, our options on that side of town were nil. Then we thought of Oz -- not *too* far away, but scary as hell.   We gave it a shot, and are glad that we did. Once inside the door, it was like Dorothy's dream, color everywhere, unlike her black and white reality. OK, maybe that was the cocktails tweaking my memory. But it is a kajillion times brighter and cleaner on the inside than it is on the outside.   Plus, the bartender was so friendly and funny. He kept us laughing the whole night. The patrons were also very charming and nice. As a bonus - there's an awesome jukebox -- IF you can get your songs in. You might have to wait through a bunch of Madonna.  I did dock a couple of stars for the limited beer and liquor selection.

I just got done eating dinner there, and I had to hurry to my computer and write a review. What a cool neighborhood bar kinda place -- with pool -- and food! Good food, at that. Well, I can only vouch for the burgers and fries.  There is LOTS of wood panelling in there, and portraits of some old white guys, and neon beer signs aplenty. The interior consists of plain booths, grey linoleum floors, and a nice worn-in bar. It's divided into two rooms. I didn't go into the second, but I could here the satisfying clink of billiard balls emanating from it.  The crowd seemed full of regulars. The bartender and other patrons often shouted hellos and goodbyes to people coming in and going out. But they were not unfriendly or cliquish.  When we sat down, we found one laminated menu our booth. So hopefully your dining companion is a fast reader.  Luckily, it's fairly short. It's basically burgers, and a few other things you can serve on a bun, fried and fresh sides, and drinks.   If you are a beer snob, this place is not for you. In addition to Coors and the like, you can also get some "old school" specials, such as PBR, Schlitz, and Miller High Life (at a mere $2 a pop!). I am happy to say that they have expanded their selection since they posted their menu online. The wine list now includes actual wines.  We ordered a couple of cheeseburgers, the "pounder" of beer-battered fries, and some sodas. After receiving our drinks, we could hear the lovely sizzle of the flat top grill. Our burgers came out a few minutes later.  Though served on a too-small plate, those burgers looked mighty fine. For some reason (maybe because I'm female?) only mine was cut in half. We also got a plastic beer pitcher filled with fries.  My burger had a nice crisp outside, and was medium rare inside. They hadn't asked how we wanted them cooked. Good thing I like medium rare. It was topped with actual cheddar cheese, a lot of onions, lettuce and tomato, and was served on a light but durable bun. I think it may have been some kind of egg bread.   The meat itself was juicy, and full of flavor. Surprisingly, it didn't have an actual winey flavor. Apparently they use sangria. It lent flavor, but didn't distract.  It didn't take long for us to kill our burgers and a pound of fries. When the bill came, it totalled just over $20. What a steal!

Honestly, I have never before even tried Korean food. It was actually my intention to go here for the sushi.   But when I saw that the dining room was full of Koreans, and read the descriptions of the dishes in the menu, I was won over. It makes sense to go with a restaurant's strengths anyway.  I chose a spicy chicken dish (dalk bokum), as a bento lunch, and waited -- for what seemed like hours. I don't know if it is normally that slow, but it certainly was that day. It seems likely due to the table of 20 seniors, some brisk delivery business, and only one server.  While I waited I observed the clean, open dining room. It was very bright inside, and every surface covered with blonde wood, so that it invoked... maybe a tea house. The one server fluttered around, fretting over the seniors, preparing items for delivery, and taking orders from other tables.  Eventually, I received my plastic bag chock full of foam containers, and I headed back to work. Once there, I opened up the bag to find it filled with a wonderful sesame, garlic, and chile pepper aroma, and in addition to my chicken, vegetables, and rice, four different marinated salads.   The chicken dish definitely ranked its two chili peppers. Luckily, the rice (which was prepared perfectly -- just the right balance of stickiness and separateness) diluted the heat. The veggies were fresh and still a little crisp, just the way I like them.  The sides consisted of a kim chee, a sesame spinach salad, a bean sprout salad, and a spicy cucumber salad. All were top notch, and provided a nice contrast to my main dish.  I would certainly return, and would like to try the table top grills of their namesake.

Bland, boring, "Mexican-esque" food.   Warning sign #1: all white people dining there. Warning sign #2: salsa that's bland as ketchup Warning sign #3: no hot sauces on the table  The three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials. Yet our plates looked almost indistinguishable from one another. On each was some configuration of flour tortillas, mountains of shredded iceberg lettuce, and a slick of pale refried beans, all topped with  orange cheese.  You can get more flavorful "Mexican" food at Del taco. This place is more like Mexican't food. Ulgh. I want my $5.25 back.

You don't have to grow the "hydo" to be a fan of Sea of Green. Anyone who wants to grow organic can benefit from their selection of organic fertilizers, amendments, and other goodies for your garden - whether soil-based or hydroponic.   Plus their staff is really friendly and knowledgeable. It doesn't hurt that they complimented me on my ride - instant gold star!

Ulgh. We knew better. But we had a gift card. How can you resist $25 off your meal, right?  It was a Saturday night, peak dinner time. The place was packed. Well, it must not have been *too* full, as we were immediately seated. But it certainly felt jammed. That was probably due to the fact that they crammed about 500 tables in the space the size of a Starbucks. To boot, those table were stocked with crying babies. Lots of crying babies.  I felt kind of bad for our server, who was a big girl. She could barely get through the back to back chairs in order to reach our table. However, during the course of dinner, my sympathy waned, as I realized she sucked as a server. I can't stand having to look at empty dirty plates, and we had to do that a lot. I was also thirsty a lot.   Now the food... wow, the food. OK, it started well enough, kind of. First, we got a really yummy loaf of rosemary-laced bread, served with EVOO and cracked pepper. That's it. No balsamic or herbs or salt. That would've been fine, if they olive oil was fantastic. But it wasn't.  The blah oil set the tone for the rest of the meal. Blah, blah, blah. The only flavor in any dish, was a hint of butter. Everything was dreadfully underseasoned. My lobster ravioli primarily tasted of the spinach pasta that surrounded it. It could've really used some garlic, salt, and some herbs.   The whole meal was completely underwhelming, and I was resentful for having spent *any* money on it. Damn you, gift card.

Populated with lots and lots of old people = a bad sign. Sure enough, the sauces were very tomatoey and a touch sweet, sort of Chef Boy R Dee-like. There was little hint of garlic, and none of herbs.   In sum, service was a bit slow, the dining rooms were nice and cozy, skip the iceberg salads, but do order the garlic bread.

I first heard about this place from the first owner of my Land Cruiser. By "heard" I mean he left a brake pads box stuffed full of parts receipts from BAP with the truck.  Then recently, we needed a part of our newly acquired 69 VW beetle. NAPA didn't have it, and the guy recommended we check out BAP.   The store itself is pretty basic. It is just a big room with aisles of stuff -- no fancy displays, no neon (I'm looking at you, AutoZone) -- and I'm totally OK with that.   I approached the parts counter and told the guy what I needed. He was kind of surly and dismissive (thus, BAP gets docked a star), and told me I had the wrong part number. However, he knew this without even looking on the computer, which to me, means he knows way more than the monkeys who work at most parts places.  They had all we needed in stock, and at a fair price. I was shocked that they didn't have to order any of it, or get it from another store. We have since gone back, with the same result.   If you have an older foreign vehicle, skip the stealership. Buy the parts you need at BAP, and take them to a trustworthy independent mechanic.

I just went there for the most boring piercing ever. I needed to get my earlobes re-done. Over the course of 20 years, the giggly girls at Piercing Pagoda have managed to mangle my ears three times. So the left hole regularly closed up, until it was all scarred up, and impossible to get any jewelry into.  When I walked into HTC, I felt a little foolish asking the pros to take on such a mundane task. But the guy didn't even bat an eye or look down his nose at me. He said, "sure, we can do that."   I filled out a little paperwork, picked out some jewelry, and away we went. The guy explained everything he was doing, and the whole process was rather painless.  This was my first piercing at a piercing place, and I quickly realized what a fool I was for not coming in sooner. Sure, it cost. But you definitely get what you pay for.  My only fear is, now that I discovered how easy it was, and how many beautiful types of jewelry there are out there (HTC had some really lovely organic pieces!), I might want more.

This place is the real deal. Wander in here, and it's like a mechanics' shop, but with pool parts -- greasy, with the hum of power tools in the background. It has that serious and unglamorous look that instills confidence in their work.  Being the do-it-yourselfers we are, I came by to grab some parts to fix our pool pump. I didn't know the make or year, but Perry knew just by looking at the parts, and grabbed the right ones for me. No problem. The prices were fair too.  I also noticed that had tons of different chemicals and equipment parts. A lot of them were brands that I had never heard of. In other words, stuff the pros use.

I was planning on doing a little trout fishing in Oak Creek Canyon, and was in need of Powerbait. I was in a hurry, so I pretty much ran in and ran out, and didn't have much of a chance to check out the shop. My impression was that it was smallish, but had all the essentials, and was very neat and tidy.  I also remember that, with no prompting from me, the guy who directed me to the bait called a friend of his up in the Canyon to ask exactly what trout were biting on at the moment. Now that's customer service!

I could no longer resist this goofy, red and white striped, old-fashioned sandwich shop. When the craving for a good sandwich kicked in, I decided to give it a shot.  As soon as you enter, you are assaulted visually with orange-red (well, I think that's what they are, underneath) walls, jam-packed with old signs, toys, and bumper stickers. Mind you, this is in a very small space. The tables are the old school laminate booths, decorated with some very 80's photos of teens. Lots of big hair!  Trying to be somewhat calorie conscious, we ordered two "mini" 5" subs and some drinks. Each also came with a rather sweet potato salad or something similar.   My chicken sub was pretty dry and boring, and served on an equally dry and flavorless white roll. The only flavor it had was the occasional pocket of black pepper.  All in all, the food got a big *meh*. The decor was cool, but not worth eating the food. Oh, and if you decide to go, bring cash, rather than deal with their bizarre ATM system.

I had no idea this place was here, or what all the had to offer. It's not nearly as big as those Asian megamarts. But for its size, New Tokyo certainly packs in a lot of goods.  Their prices are very fair as well. I think I spent about $15, and got sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, wonton wrappers, panko (99 cents!). The liquids were all BIG bottles too.   I'm kind of annoyed that we were in a hurry. I could have spent a lot of time in there, buying LOTS of stuff. I guess that means that I'll just have to go back -- shoot.

West-Siders, rejoice! The name is Filipino, the signage is in uhhhh Japanese (?), and the contents are Vietnamese and Thai. Manila Supermarket has it all!  Actually the goods are *primarily* Vietnamese and Thai. But Japan, China, even the Caribbean and India are represented.   And not only are there dry goods, but there is also a sort of pharmacy, there is fresh meat and seafood (some swimming in the tanks), a mini electronics store, and a lunch counter.  The produce section is  bit small, but has fresh thai basil, kaffir lime leaves, japanese eggplant, bitter melon, persimmons, weird banana varieties, and all kinds of other fantastic ingredients. If you're adventurous (or masochistic) you'll find the durian in the freezer.  All I needed was some lychees, but I also picked up a jar of sambal olek, furikake, and some unidentifiable baked goods for dinner. They turned out to be something like shrimp hush puppies, and bean mochi. Grand total: $7.36!  I dig this place with a backhoe, baby!

I was so very disappointed. My experience with mongolian bbq has always been great - lots of fresh choices, cooked and chopped on a sizzling griddle, then piled high, piping hot in a bowl.  YC's was the antithesis of this experience. Old, bland ingredients, limited choices, no broad array of sauces and spices to spruce up your bowl with. I couldn't even bring myself to finish one bowl.  To make matters worse, the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse.

Since I just signed up a week ago, I'm sure I'll have to update this later. But I thought I would at least log my first impressions.  First off, when we called, we got the usual sales tactics. The guy was really reluctant to give us a straight answer about how much membership costs, and how much the initiation fee is, and all that jazz. He also kept pressuring us to come in and talk with him.  Sadly, his tactics worked.   We headed on over there to check it out. It being around 5 or 6pm, the place was utterly packed. We had to park kind of far. But we're trying to get into shape, so what's a little extra walking?  Inside, it looks like it was built 15+ years ago. Miami Vice paint colors, neon signage, and the dents and scuffs on the walls and furniture that come with daily wear-and-tear. It wasn't shabby looking, just broken in. It actually made the place seem less intimidating, like when a burly guy wears a sweater.  The clientele looks like a bunch of average joes. The equipment isn't the latest and greatest. But they do the job. There are no spa-like perks or fancy decor. The place's mission is to work with average folks and get them into shape. It seemed like the perfect fit for us.  Our sales guy chatted with us for a bit, gave us the tour, and then took our measurements and weight. We sat down. discussed the membership options, and picked the one that suited us. It wasn't a steal of a deal, but it wasn't bad either.  Once all the paperwork was signed, and the credit cards run, we scheduled our first two training sessions (free!). Here we hit a snag.   Right from the start, we said we wanted mornings. We are morning people. We are motivated in the morning. We don't like being around hordes of people, like they have in the evenings.  The guy with "The Book" told us that there were no trainers available in the morning for several weeks. Typical. We clashed over that for a while, but eventually caved. We're stuck with evening training sessions for the time being.  We just did our first free session, and had varying experiences. We were both scheduled the same trainer, but he wasn't there. So we each got a different guy.  My girlfriend loved her trainer. He gave her a tough -- but not too tough -- workout, motivating her throughout. He made suggestions about her nutrition, and didn't really try to sell her on the supplements.  My guy was very nice, and pretty laid back. Almost too laid back. My workout was pretty easy. He didn't go over some of the basics of weight training. Luckily I knew them already. We didn't discuss nutrition very much. He did try to sell me on supps, but not really hard. My session was also about 15 minutes short.  We're going to be working out on our own next week. We'll see how that goes.

It's next door to the American Legion hall. That must be where most of their customers come  from. Everything just lacked flavor. Heck, I'd even take some salt.   I wasn't expecting spicy or seasoned, as that's a whole 'nother cuisine. I just wanted some kind of flavor.   And if I can't get flavor, I'll at least take some texture. But no. Instead of a fluffy, crispy batter on the fish, it was tough and a bit chewy. The breading on the clams was a little better, but still flavorless.   The only bright points were the steak fries and cole slaw, both made well. But how hard is it to screw those up?

Excellent gyros, and the warmest, fluffiest pita ever. The hummus was more on the lemony side, which was refreshing, though I prefer it more garlicky. The italian beef was tasty, but the bread could not withstand the juice, and it got gooey.  The interior could use some help, and our server seemed a bit strung out. But the the service was attentive and quick. The prices are really fair as well.

My go-to for affordable, solid Mexican food. Whenever I've had a crap day and just want something hearty, and a little greasy, I stop by on the way home and pick up dinner for the whole fam, and an horchata for me.   Everything I've gotten has been really delish -- especially the shredded beef. Maybe not the fish tacos. They were OK, but I would not get them again.   I also walk out of there with probably 50 little containers of the various salsa, in different combinations.

This is another one of those places that you would typically miss when driving by in your car, or even if you were stopped at a light right there on Olive, possibly even if you were sitting at a bus stop across the street. It has blank concrete and glass facade. But inside, it's like Cooter's garage, but cleaner, and way bigger.  I was a bit fuzzy when my friends dragged me in here, but I seem to recall high ceilings, neon, and aluminum signs. But I could be wrong.   I definitely remember that I utterly devoured a platter of hot, fried shrimp served with a nicely spicy, horseradishy cocktail sauce, and that our server was so sweet.   I've heard that their Friday fish fry can't be missed. Judging from those shrimp alone, I'd say that's probably very true.

This our favorite lake on which to take the boat out. The obvious reason being, it's the only one on the West side.   However, in addition to convenience, we love it because it is so large. There is plenty of room for everyone. So it's easy to find a cove, drop anchor and just chill, without a million people all around you.  In addition, the main boat ramp is nice and wide, so there's rarely a wait, and there is plenty of parking. There is another ramp available as well, but we have never used it.

We looked at a lot of reviews before we left, so we knew it was old and run-down before we got there. But it was cheap - $65 and $75 a night - and centrally located. So we decided we would just put up with it.  The rooms looked like there were straight off the set of the Golden Girls, but like a crappier more ghetto version of the show.  The hallway was dank. It was obvious they'd had a pretty major leak in the recent past. By "recent" I mean possibly a year ago. It just smelled like a basement, and feet.  Our room had a beautiful view of the roof full of air conditioners below. Our friend was lucky enough to get a room across the hall, so it at least overlooked the pool.  The bar staff pretty much sucked. If you were playing the slots the servers took foreeeeeeever to take your orders, and then another millenium to actually bring you your drink. I'm pretty sure I aged a couple of years while waiting.  If you happened to have spent your money by the time she got back or you just wanted to move machines, tough luck, you're not getting your drink! And she will make you feel like a turd for asking for it.  Tired of the slowpoke service, we headed to the bar. The bartender was also a condescending a-hole. The rail drinks tasted like dissolved pills mixed with rad fluid.   I'm sure they whole crappy service / crappy drinks scenario is engineered so that you just buy your drinks. Didn't work. We just brought down drinks from our room.  Oh, and I'm giving one star because a) I have to, and b) the "dealertainers" are creepily awesome.

Worst $12 chicken sandwich. EVER.  I'd give them one star, but I feel like I need to throw in one more, just because the decor was beautiful, and the weather was great on the patio. They caught me in a good mood.  We accidentally wandered in during brunch. We had already eaten breakfast, so we were in a tough spot. However, the waitron was kind enough to offer up some lunch menus. Good on her.   It was also nice of her to bring the flavored syrup for my soda separately. Now if only she'd brought the check in a timely manner when we were done.  I ended up ordering something off the brunch menu anyway -- a grilled chicken sandwich. Supposedly, it's topped with brie and arugula, dressed in a bacon dressing, and served on brioche.   Someone must've forgotten to place their Sysco order. Because, my sandwich was topped with cream cheese with some brie rind mixed in, and spinach. There were some cold pieces of bacon fat in there, that may indicate some sort of dressing.  The chicken itself was moist, but completely flavorless.The brioche had potential, but somehow it got soggy and gross.  Bleagh. I hate to say it, but I could have gotten a better chicken sandwich at Applebee's for $7.95.

So NOT a dive bar. More like, a swanky basement bar from the 60s. Big black pleather booths, pool table, low ceilings, and a hefty wooden bar with a formica top.  I can't comment on the nightlife. I tend to wander in during the late afternoon, especially on Sundays. That's the way I like it chill, quiet, uncrowded, I get the bartender's full attention, and can rule the jukebox.  Also, word to the wise, if you are a bit of a vintage cocktail geek, such as myself, make your way to Shady's - NOW. They have all the necessary ingredients, and -- depending on who's behind the bar -- expertise needed to craft the obscure old cocktail of your choice.  Seriously, housemade grenadine and simple syrup, Aperol, Lillet Blanc, Maraschino; you name it, they have it. Cheers!

I usually don't like to add to a review pile-on, especially when all that needs to be said has been said. But in my effort to drink more local coffee, and less of The Siren's, I have to add my oh-two.  I dig Copper Star -- good coffee, friendly crew, a drive through. Heck, one time, I even got a free Powerball ticket there.  I only have one quibble, and it's a small one. I only mention it because I care. It's the excessive and cheesy signage.  I liked the little hand-painted sandwich board, that read, "drink local coffee." It fit perfectly with their local business vibe.  Now that sign has been repainted in a more generic manner, and moved to the side. In its stead is a gigantic white vinyl banner, on it, printed in stark, black, all caps "DRIVE THRU COFFEE."  Gag.   So now there's the generic sandwich board, the huge banner, the flappy flags, and the neon in the window.   I understand that they are trying to increase business. But now it's looking like a used car lot, and reeks of desperation. People don't like to patronize desperate business, because it's sad, and makes them feel sad too.  Please, Copper Star, dial it down a notch. Share your message with confidence, but without shouting. We will still love you!  EDIT: OK I stopped by the very next day, and the "DRIVE THRU COFFEE" banner was replaced by a huge red banner with all caps white lettering that reads, "SANDWICH KING OF 7TH AVE."  Ulgh.

Gahhh! I mean... gahh!!  I guess the endless cheesy commecials finally got to me. Despite my instincts, and the signs -- cartoony logo, aforementioned cheesy commericals -- I decided to give it a try.  The decor was cozy -- chock-a-block with wine crates, fake vines, and the like -- but it actually worked in this case. Our server took a while, but was friendly, once she arrived.  I ordered a glass of pinot noir, and again, against my better instincts, I ordered the salmon. Past experience has told me than not many places can prepare salmon the way I like it -- a little crisp on the outside, medium-rare on the inside. But I gave it a shot.   First clue that was a mistake: my server did not ask how I would like it prepared.  Second clue: she was completely taken aback when I said, "medium rare."  While we waited, we munched on some really delicious crisp and chewy bread, dipped in olive oil. My companion also enjoyed a  caesar salad topped with a nice, slightly fishy (in a good way) dressing and parmesan shavings.  When the entrees arrives, we both immediately said the same thing, "oh my god, it's swimming in butter!" Now I'm with Paula Deen on the butter issue. Butter is good -- but not 2 inches of it in my dish.  When I examined the salmon, it was nice and crisp on the outside. But as soon as I touched it with my fork, it fell apart. Alas, cooked until it flaked.  Once my companion fished the veal piccata out of the butter, she found it tough and nearly inedible. The piccata sauce lacked the bright lemon-garlic taste that it's known for. It was basically butter and capers. The pasta on both our dishes was fairly good.  All in all, I would not return. It was a half step above Olive Garden.  Lesson learned: Listen to your instincts!

While I give the management props for honoring our gift certificate, even though our total rang up below the minimum price, the food was teh ick.   I got the fish tacos. I understand the urge to make them unique, and different from the thousands of varieties of fish tacos available in the Valley. But this attempt was a huge miss.   The tilapia tasted pretty muddy, even for tilapia. It was served with a really sweet, sticky, almost BBQ-style sauce. I was alternately pleased that it was so cloying that it almost covered the icky river flavor of the tilapia, and perplexed at this odd pairing. The avocados also had a funny, chemical flavor to them. Double-yuck.

I love some good Southern food. I crave it. It's my comfort food.   So I was pretty excited to find that such a place exists, just a stone's throw from my home. I had to check it out, ASAP. And then come back, just to be sure. And then make one more visit to try something else. Now I can safely say that Restaurant 28 is one of my go-to spots.  They're known mainly for their barbecue, which is of the slightly smoky, sour variety of the Carolinas -- the sort I prefer. The red sauce is rather bland and ketchuppy. But the bottle on the table contains the plain vinegar and red pepper type I go for.  Be aware that their off the bone barbeque is not pulled, rather it is choppped, and dry. You do it up yourself, however you like.   My compadres (who hail from Louisiana) tend to opt for the fried catfish. They gave it very high marks -- crispy and a tad spicy.  Every side I have tried has been perfect, though I usually go for greens and beans.   Typically, I'm way too full to even consider dessert. But one time I did buy a whole sweet potato pie to make it home. It was excellent -- custardy and sweet.

This was my first time back since they moved into their new digs. It was a mixed experience.  As in previous experiences, the food was excellent. In fact, I think it has improved. The fried whiting was delicious, and moist, with a crispy crunchy cornmeal coating. The greens and black eyed peas were stellar. Everything was seasoned and spiced just right.   This is my qualm with a lot of soul food places in the Valley (Lo-Lo's, I'm looking at you!). Most other places really under-season their food. Restaurant 28 gets it right. Everything is flavorful, and a little spicy, but in a different way.  Now, one thing that has gotten worse since the move, is the service. Their system worked just fine when they had 6 tables and counter service. Not so much with a big room that seats about 100 people.   Though there were only 4 parties there when we went, service was painfully slow. There were longgggggggg waits between waitstaff visits. Our drinks were never refilled, our dirty plates were never removed, and we had to ask for the bill and dessert to go.   This last visit reminded me how much I love their food, and I will definitely go back for more -- but maybe just "to go", until they hire a professional staff.

I swore I had already reviewed this place. But I must've been hallucinating (again.) I had stopped in here quite a while back, to pick up some sushi, gyoza, and seaweed salad to go. I was pretty unimpressed, and I remember thinking I'd give it two and a half stars.  However, I went back on Friday, and went for the full-on Korean BBQ experience -- a first for me. And I am so glad, I gave Takamatsu a second chance, especially where they can show off their star attraction.  I was a little early, and decided that while I was waiting for my dining companion, I'd sip a G&T. Bad idea.   First, I had to point out to the server which bottle on the bar was the gin. Then, I tried (and failed) to explain what tonic was. I got a gin and soda, no lime. I doctored it up with a sugar packet and the lemon wedge from my water, but ulgh.  Again, my bad for not playing to their strengths. I should've gotten a beer, or heck, a plain ol' shot of booze.  Since it was the first Korean BBQ experience for us, we decided to pick one thing we'd heard of and one that was kind of healthy. We went for the bu-go-ki beef and the shrimp.   Our server returned with about a dozen little dishes full of fixins, and placed a grate on the grill and turned it on. The dishes contained kim-chee, fish cakes, something spinachy, something bean sprouty, little minnow jerkies, bean paste, tofu, pickles, jalapenos, and garlic cloves. I may have forgotten a couple of things.  I don't know if we were getting the short shrift, or if our server assumed we were pros at this, because the process was not explained at all. Luckily, I'm a grilling fool, so I just dove right in and started cooking some meat. We also had to flag her down in order to ask what some of the things were as well.    In addition, when we were done with our beef, and were ready to move onto shrimp, she didn't change the grate. I didn't even know this was an option, until I saw a neighboring table have it done. I tend to think it was just shoddy service, since we waited ages for drink refills as well.  I don't want to say it was because we were some of the few non-Koreans there. I think it was more likely that it was because we were just a two top, and not doing mad shots of shoyu = less opportunity for a big tip. Either way, the service part of the experience kind of sucked.   Nonetheless, I'd readily come back -- maybe with a group.

I'll get right to it. Their fried chicken is the best. It blows Lolo's out of the water!  It has a light, crisp coating, the chicken itself was juicy and well-seasoned. Per usual, I got the hot sauce bottle at the ready. But after tasting that chicken, I set it right back into the rack. It didn't need a thing.  Honestly, the chicken was better the first time I went, rather than the second time. I think the second time, they cut back on the salt.   There was great praise for the fried catfish and the red beans. My dining companion is from New Orleans, and she raved about the red beans. She claimed they are the closest thing to the real deal that she has tasted, outside of N.O. I thought they had a slight earthy, smoky flavor to them, that I couldn't quite pinpoint (maybe sage or file?), but was quite tasty.  The cornbread was mighty fine too (IIRC, it was sweetened). Next time, I'll pass on the mac and cheese. I thought it was pretty bland -- tasted mostly of the starchy sauce, little of the cheese. The noodles were cooked to oblivion. But mac and cheese is such a subjective matter. I am sure there are many others who will love it.  The greens were really delicious. Salt, fat, sweet, and spice were all represented in just the right ratio.   I have not tried the desserts, so I cannot comment on them. I did note that they have red velvet cake, and several soda cakes. Yum!  Atmosphere-wise, it is a comfortable little place that has live music and comedy on the weekends and evenings. The staff is super-friendly and even a little chatty.  So stop by Lil Mama's and have some chicken!

The place is indeed crammed floor to ceiling, front to back, with thrift store finds and ebay fodder; mostly vintage goods, with a few funky modern things thrown in. There is sort of a system to how it's organized -- one room that is predominantly kitchen gear, another, mostly kids' stuff -- but mostly it's a jumble.  I spent a good half an hour in there, just making my way around, looking at things -- skull-themed windchimes, tin day of the dead wall art, old soda bottles, vintage barware, plastic cocktail squid. Unfortunately, I was on a mission. I needed something space age themed. I'll be darned! There was not a single item that fit that description.   That just means I'll have to come back when I "need" something odd.

First, the good. Compared to the most likely alternative for me -- Albertson's -- Fry's has good prices. Not just the sale stuff either -- the base prices are decent too.   Often, you can even score a good deal in their kitchen wares section as well. Plus, they have one of those add-on areas, where they sell furniture, and all sorts of other non-grocery whatnot. I scored some sweet lawn chairs there for a song.  However, so many things about  this store drive me crazy, more often than not, I am willing to pay more elsewhere, than shop here.   It starts when you enter the parking lot. No matter what time of day, it's jammed. Every time, I have to navigate through crowds of moseying pedestrians and speeding tuners to get some spot a mile from the entrance.  When you eventually park and walk in, you find the carts are stored on the exit side. You can either enter through the wrong door, or wait for the throngs to exit so you can cross over and go get your cart.  Then, you are greeted with a gigantic seasonal display in the center of the foyer. This, combined with people entering and exiting, the completely uninhabited floral area, and the line of people waiting to send moneygrams and buy lottery tickets, puts a stranglehold on the doorway. Let's just say I just hope there is never a fire here.  The display is just a sign of things to come. There are about 30 smaller displays in each aisle, narrowing them down to one cart width. Since the store is always mobbed, these peninsulas of products only increase the traffic jams, which makes everyone cranky, and thus, heighten the stress of shopping there.  And so, to save the remains of my sanity, I only shop at this Fry's when I am truly hard up for cash.

I have to say, this is my favorite Starbucks location, and the reason for that is entirely, the staff. They are the most cheery and efficient crew I've ever encountered.  Often during the day, they are utterly mobbed with customers. Yet they keep them moving along speedily, yet never feeling rushed.   I'm stunned that, with as many people as they deal with per day, they manage to remember so many names and orders. I want some of whatever vitamins they're taking!

Bartlett is a decent-sized lake, and not too crowded. It's best feature is the availability of beaches that you can either drive to (in a 4WD vehicle) or boat to, and camp on.  FYI, it's also home to the twice-a-year big gay campout, known as Bartlett Bash.

You know that funky, teen boy smell? And I don't mean funky like Parliament. I mean funky like, pee-yoo!  Well, when the weather was warm, we stashed our winter comforter in the guest room. From there, it was occasionally borrowed by our 17 year old.   Now that the weather has finally cooled off, we want it back on our bed. But ooh ooh... that smell. Yuck!   The comforter is too bulky to be effectively washed in our machine. So I started calling various laundries around town, to see who could do the job.   As lit turns out, the fourth place I tried, Clean Livin' Laundry, had the price, location, and hours I was looking for. Bonus, they were running a 2 for 1 special on bulky items for February. So I snagged the pet-befurred comforter off our bed too.   The place itself is modest, small, and little on the old side. But the lady managing the place was incredibly nice, and she did an excellent job on our bedding. I dropped them off on the way to work, and picked them up on the way home. Cost, $20.  Both were warm from the dryer, and wrapped in plastic. When I opened the packaging up, the scent was awesome -- fresh, flowery, and soapy. And I think they look cleaner and brighter than when I first bought them! I'm tempted to bring all of our bedding and blankets there, for a fresh Spring cleaning.

I got some coupons in the mail, urging me to try out this newly-renovated Safeway. It's only a touch further than my Albertsons, so i  figured, why not?  I hadn't seen it before, so I can't really compare it to its old state. But it certainly is pretty now. It appears this now is one of those fancier "market" type Safeways.  My feelings on those are mixed. I like that they offer some more gourmet, and high quality products. I don't like the clausterphobic feeling created by higher shelves and narrower aisles -- exacerbated by lots of displays. Maybe that's just my hangup.   The store was blessedly empty for a Sunday afternoon, so I didn't have to fight too many people to get by. But I imagine if I tried to shop on a Monday evening, I'd have to hurt someone.  Anyway, the store is very neat and bright, and has many services, such as a large floral section and of course, a Starbucks. There is a another one in the parking lot, in case you start to crash within those 50 yards.  I was also pleased to find that they have a gas station out front too, and you can qualify for 20 cents off a gallon - that's cheaper than Costco! I will certainly be hitting them up for my next fill up.

If you really like speed, this is the place for you. The track is challenging, the heats are fairly long, and the carts go FAST (around 45 mph).   We went on an early Saturday afternoon, and it wasn't very crowded. There were probably 8-10 carts running each heat. It was enough to make it challenging, but not so many that it's annoying.   The rates are also decent. We did the non-members' special -- two heats for $40. I often see $5 off postcards around town too.  I did deduct one star, because the carts beat you up. All of us left with sore arms, shoulders, and necks, and my back is bruised. Two days later, I'm still downing Tylenol. Fast carts + twisty track + two heats + no power steering = pain.  However, I love speed, so I would totally do it again -- maybe just one time around though.

No, really. It's a place that sells just firewood. I kid you not. It's one of those businesses you didn't really know you needed, until you needed it.   We bought a house last Spring, equipped with a fireplace. Around Christmas time, we wanted to light it up for the friends and family who would be staying with us.   I've always used the bags of wood they sell at convenience stores. But I noticed this place along my daily commute -- a firewood place -- and decided to check it out.  It's basically just a fenced in lot with a shelter that functions as the office, and huge piles of cut wood and several wheelbarrows of bagged logs. Some men were busily sawing hunks of  wood into more manageable logs, and tossing them into the piles.   The logs are divided by tree type, and priced differently. I remember seeing pecan, orange wood, juniper, pine, and hardwoods, among others. The man in charge helped me choose what I needed -- a combination of juniper to get the fire started and for the scent, and some hardwood to make it last a long time. One of the guys who was sawing loaded three huge bags of wood into my truck for me.  The prices were a bit higher than at the convenience store. But I feel like it was a good investment and will definitely go back when we run out.  Oh, and you can also buy jerky there too. I hear it's really good, but haven't tried it myself.

I typically like to go to NAPA, Carquest, or BAP for auto parts. But I have to say that this AutoZone has saved my ass more than once, for the sheer fact that it is ALWAYS open (literally, 24/7!), and it's close to my house.  I also use their website pretty often, for the repair info section, when I don't have my shop manual nearby. It even has diagrams of systems and such.

Sure, they might be a bit more spendy than the Fry's down the street. But my sanity is worth that price.   While that Fry's is a zoo 24/7, (I'll have to review it separately), Albertsons is an oasis of banal pleasure. It starts with the Starbucks at the entrance, and ends with the sweet emo kid who mans the register.  The produce man always greets me, and even though I know he is forced to do so, it's still nice. Nice. That's how the whole store is -- uncrowded, wide aisles, neatly stocked goods, everything clean and tidy -- nice. It's like the valium of grocery stores.

Our kitchen was basically under construction, and our bellies were empty from all the hard work. Pizza or Chinese just wasn't going to cut it. I wanted a sandwich -- a GOOD sandwich. Not a sub -- a sandwich.   That's how I managed to track down Archie's. It portrays itself as a traditional New York style deli. Well, I don't know about all that, but they do make some fine sandwiches.  All their sandwiches have goofy names, none of which I remember, and they didn't have any to-go menus. The sandwiches are listed on huge boards over the counter -- one board for each main ingredient: beef, pastrami, ham, chicken, fish, and vegetarian.   We went with a hot pastrami with swiss and grilled onions on pumpernickel, and a chicken salad on challah. The breads for both were just plain awesome. I really enjoyed the pastrami. The chicken salad, while better than most, was still slightly off. I think it was kind of sweet, which was just weird. Same with the potato salad -- odd, but not bad.  I was surprised that they didn't serve Dr. Brown's sodas. I got a Boylan's diet cherry soda, which was actually fantastic. That was just one of the things that makes it untraditional deli. I'd say the place is more "modern" deli.   I also can't tell if it's a chain or not. The signage is all well done and matchy-matchy, though slightly worn, which makes me thing "chain." But the staff all seems like family, and there are some quirky things that make me think, "indy." Maybe it's a franchise. I don't know, and I guess it doesn't really matter.  Also of note, they had an extensive and tasty looking breakfast menu, featuring things like lox and halibut. I'll have to remember that, the next bleary Sunday morning I experience, when the cupboard is empty.  EDIT: Hey I just found their website, where you can check out the menus. I asked the Yelp admins to add it.

At last, a sushi bar that isn't a hot spot, and isn't completely devoid of atmosphere. It is the perfect balance -- clean, but comfortable, sophisticated, yet friendly. What's more, the food is EXCELLENT.  I have been there three times so far, and I have yet to find complaint with the food. The sushi is fresh and fantastic. Hana orders whole fish, straight from the coast.   The ahi I had was glossy and ruby red; the flavor delicate. It had the perfect texture, with just enough "give," so that one does not struggle with biting it, and not so soft that it lacks substance. It was also a generous portion, draped over a small, but flavorful rice ball.  Their tempura has lovely and light batter, and it enrobes fresh, crisp veggies, and sweet, tender shrimp. The miso soup is also good, and they don't hold back on the goodies. For once, I found that tofu can have flavor!  When I ordered the bento, it was filled with all sorts of treats! Some I could not even identify. I am embarrassed to say, I was well and truly stuffed, when I finished eating it all.   Surprisingly, the prices are very reasonable! Nigiri goes for about $3-$5, maki about $5-$10, noodle dishes $80-$10, and entrees $12-$15. I have only been during lunch time, so I don't know if these change for dinner.  That all said, since it is brand-spanking new, and its staff is still learning the ropes, Hana struggles a bit with service. Sometimes entrees come out poorly-timed. Sometimes you have to wait for your dishes to be cleared. You might get a bit thirsty, waiting for your refill.  But it is worth it. It is so worth it. Check it out!

I'll be honest. My recollection of this place is a bit vague. My visit was preceded by several hours of lounging by the pool, sipping homemade limoncello cocktails. No, I did not drive. For the record, it was early --say, 7-ish --on a Saturday night.  What I DO remember is this: the scene was casual, the folks were friendly, the jukebox ROCKED. We blasted Bad Religion, Misfits, Beastie Boys, and even a lil James Brown. I played pool against many strangers (and lost). I would go back in a heartbeat.  While Rogue West shares the same name as the one in Scottsdale, they are no longer affiliated with one another. I've been to that other one a few times before, and I must say, West is best. And I'm not just saying that because it's in my neighborhood, and that I was half-cocked when I went there. It was just... more my speed.

I remember when I heard this place was opening, I was stoked. At last, there was to be a non-chain fine dining restaurant on the West side. It only took a year and half for me to go there. I justify this lapse as giving them plenty of time to get the kinks out.  In order to beat the noise and crowds, we went for an early dinner on Friday. Our server was very amiable and polite, but I'm not entirely sure of his knowledge of the restaurant's products.   Upon looking at the menus, I must agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the dishes offered were uninspired. There were several items that looked good, but none that I felt were "must try" or innovative.   I was pleased to see several classic cocktails on the drinks menu. However, when I ordered one, it was made improperly. This seems to be the common theme with Skye -- they aim high, but miss the mark.  When the appetizers arrived, I thought they were like Applebee's-type offerings, but made with fancier ingredients (e.g. the duck and brie quesadilla). The coconut shrimp tasted like something out of the freezer.  The shrimp in my entree were woefully overcooked, at the risotto did not taste of tequila or cayenne, as the menu promised. My companion's steak was rather good, but her mashed potatoes looked like plastic, and tasted odd, as if maybe they contained parsnips or turnips. It's no surprise that we did not stay for dessert.  I am torn, because I thought the food was so blah. Yet selfishly, I want Skye to succeed, in the hopes that more restaurants will want to make a go on the West side.

I've been back a couple of times since my first review, and the results were much more positive.   I found that if you order pho to go, you can ask them to package the meat separately, as long as you swear to cook it right away. I did so, and the pho was much tastier when prepared fresh.  Another time, determined to branch out from pho, I ordered the special catfish. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of bottom feeders. They get that muddy flavor to them.   But not this catfish! It tasted clean and fresh, and it had a light, crispy breading on it. The whole dish was fantastic.   I also still adore their melon boba tea. I tried the taro one time, and it was OK. But melon is where it's at. My only criticism is that the boba pearls have a slightly gritty texture.

I went here for breakfast with some friends, and I don't remember much about it -- just that I didn't enjoy it very much. I do remember that the breakfast menu was pretty limited. Also that everything was pretty flavorless.   Maybe I would try it again for lunch, as that seems to be their strong point.

Beautiful office, awesome staff. The hygienists are very nice and have a gentle hand when they do the cleanings.  Plus there are little perks that a lot of dental and medical practices seem to forget these days. They are really good about reminding you for your appointments and I have never had longer than a 5 or 10 minute wait for my appointment.  My only quibble with them, is that they are always going for the upsell (whitening, straightening, oral cancer screening?). Thankfully, they've toned it down quite a bit recently, and if you give them a firm "not interested" they leave you alone.

We decided to go as a family one Sunday afternoon, to get outdoors, and do something together. We even took the dogs.   The DVRAC consists of a small building that gives you the info about the history of the area, and what you are about to see outside. Once you exit the other side, you start on a short trail, that includes numbered stops.   Your brochure has information about each stop. Or, you can wait until a tour starts, and have it all explained to you. There are also scheduled demonstrations and talks.  We were the only people there, so we really took our time, and examined everything. It's amazing how many petroglyphs there are, and so close together. You could spend a lot of time just hunting with your eyes. I did wish I had brought my binoculars, since some of them are a way up the hill.  We too, met Bear, who is actually not a ranger, but is employed by ASU. The property is owned by the company that built the dam, on which the building sits, and the facility is administered by students of ASU's anthropology, geology, and similar departments.  At any rate, since we were the only people there, Bear was able to spend a good deal of time talking with us. If you would like to meet him, hurry -- he is retiring soon.   All in all, the Deer Valley Rock Art Center is a fun, inexpensive, educational way to spend an hour or two outdoors, and isn't very far away.

Thanks to Amanda B. for the 411 on this place! It is just what we were looking for -- good, fresh, quality Chinese food, close to home. Not only that, the dining environment is really comfy and welcoming too.  To start, we have some egg rolls and devil wings. The egg rolls appeared to be rolled in house, were flavorful, piping hot and stuffed with crunchy cabbage and a little pork. The devil wings didn't quite live up to their name. The come out "naked", and you drizzle on your own sauce. I think they would've been better tossed in the sauce before they came out of the kitchen.  We shared the house lo mein, which is lo mein noodles with chicken, shrimp, and beef. The noodles has just the right amount of chewiness, and were even crispy in some spots. All of the meat was really high quality - tender beef, chicken breast, and shrimp that pop when you bite them. The veggies were nice and bright, and cooked to perfection.  I'm stoked! The only bummer, is that I'm slightly out of their delivery range. However, they are good enough and close enough that I would drive to pick it up.

This should be obvious to everyone. It should have been obvious to me. But please don't order anything other than the Chinese dishes. Don't order sushi! Don't get a steak! You'll be really, really disappointed.  Despite my long-standing strategy of going with a restaurant's strengths when I order, I decided to get sushi one time. I knew better. I really did. But damn, sushi sounded good. As it so happened, my friend didn't want Chinese, so she ordered a steak.  The sushi was so icky. The ahi tuna was BROWN. I could barely choke any of it down, and ended up leaving most of it. My friend's steak was thin, tough, and cooked to oblivion.  My GF was smart and ordered the lunch special, and was happy as a clam. Thankfully, she shared.  I would deduct a star, but, since that time, I've gone back a few more times and "went with their strengths." Those trips reinvigorated my enthusiasm for China Grill.  Oh and I found I actually am within their delivery zone. We have ordered from them a few times, and it's always good, but not as good as when you dine in.

In my eyes, China Chan is completely redeemed. Apparently, I suck at picking dim sum dishes - except for the last time. I ordered the fried taro, the baked bbq beef buns, and the Chinese broccoli.  The fried taro were fluffy, crispy balls of delicious starch, and oh-so-good. The baked bbq beef buns were egg-washed puffs of soft dough, filled with sticky-sweet beef.  Unfortunately, I never received my broccoli. So I can't judge that. From what I saw on other folks' tables, it looked damn tasty.

I probably drove by this place a thousand times, and didn't give it a second thought. Housed in a muddy yellow, squat brick building, with a dingy awning, I didn't have much hope for Ollie's.   But Sunday morning, the pantry was empty, we were out of coffee (NOOOOOOO!!!), and needed to calorie-load for a busy day of home improvement.   The area IHOPs and Waffle Houses, are always just  meh at best. The dining experiences there usually involve lots of crying babies, spotty service, and sticky tables. Black Bear Diner just had a ridiculous number of cars in the parking lot, and we were not up for a long wait. Plus their biscuits are dry and crumbly.  That's when Ollie's popped into our minds.   When we arrived, there was a decent number or cars in the parking lot, but not too many. The interior betrays the dull exterior. It is bright, and minimally decorated with cutesy country accents, and a couple of portable AC units. We were seated within a minute by a friendly hostess.  Our server, a no-nonsense kind of lady, with probably many years of front of the house experience, came by shortly thereafter. She offered a  a quick "good morning," and came back in a hurry with a carafe of surprisingly good coffee. As she went around the room, doting on the regulars, we looked over the menu.  No surprises there. The first 80-something selections are omelets. I'm sorry to say, I'm not a big fan of omelets. So I chose the egg and cheese breakfast burritos and some home fries. My dining companion chose the steak and eggs with hash browns.  Our order was to our table in record time. The server left before we could ask for any condiments, but like a true veteran, she was back in a few seconds, laden with everything we could possibly need.  First impressions -- presentation was minimal. After all, it is just breakfast, so I don't really care about all that anyway. The burrito was piping hot, so I snacked on the home fries for a while. Whoa! They were good! Crispy and seasoned on the outside, fluffy on the inside -- like curly fries, but in dice form.  When I could finally pick up the burrito, I found it stuffed with light, fluffy eggs and cheddar cheese. The cheese was kind of cheapie and took a while to melt, but tasted OK. The salsa served with it was not bad.  My companion's verdict on the steak and eggs was that it was good, but not worth $8.99. I believe our total bill was about $21.  All in all, this may be our new "go-to" restaurant for breakfast, when we wake up unprepared and starving.

Stopped in to check out the new West side location. LOVE IT. Love it.  It's like a warehouse of alcohol! They have everything. There were about 3 aisles each of wine and beer alone. Plus, every kind of liquor you could possibly need -- even those ingredients needed for classic cocktails, like chartreuse, maraschino, and pastis.  To top it all off, their prices are quite reasonable. At first, I was surprised to see that their sale prices only knocked off a buck of two. But then I realized that their base prices were a lot lower than what you'd find in stores and specialty stores. So they didn't  have a whole lot of markup to work with.  I could have spent a great deal of money there, but I was able to restrain myself, and left with just a bottle of 100 proof vodka and a bottle of jager. However, I'll definitely be back when I have some spare cash, and want to stock my pitiful bar.

I DUG it. First off, for me, any Thai place that has drunken noodle is awesome. It was different than I've had at other Thai places -- more veggies, and more variety of veggies, less noodles and meat. That made for a refreshing change, even for an old stick-in-the-mud such as myself.  Secondly, the service was outstanding. Our servers were very attentive (but not annoyingly so), cheerful, and kept the drinks topped off.  I didn't know what to think of the bullet holes in the front glass -- cool, or disturbing? I was also a little afraid to walk to my car, which was parked in the overflow parking in the back.   Thankfully, I lived long enough to write this review.

Since my first review, I've probably gone to Thai Hut maybe 20 times or so. I was on a real kick for a while there, going once or twice a week, and the shine still has not worn off. I love this place even more.  Their food even made a convert of my girlfriend. She had tried Thai food once and hated it. After dining at Thai Hut, she now suggests we go there, and often.  Since my first visit, I have also dined at Chanpen and Erawan, and they don't hold a candle to Thai Hut. It's still my favorite by miles.  Dammit. Now I'm craving their Pad Kee Mao again!

I have been stalking this store for months, eyeing it greedily every time I visited the neighboring Costco, giddily anticipating the demise of the Camelback Target - a harbinger of the soon-to-be SuperTarget. At last, it is open!  Of course, this happened right when I am very low on funds. Therefore I had to limit my trip to a brief recon only, and perhaps, buying one or two or thirty different things I "needed." (Hello, cheesy $1 skull necklace!) The booty even included food -- fresh food.   I only managed to see 1/3 of the store, but it was glory to behold. Bright lights, clean floors, produce stacked in eerie perfection, a staff that greets you at every turn, and guides you to what you seek. AND, it has a Starbucks.  Hurry, my friends. Get there before the deterioration begins. It is in Christown / Spectrum Mall, after all. Savor every glistening moment of Target nirvana, while it lasts.

It seems like it took an ETERNITY to build and open this little 400 sq. ft. coffee stand. It finally opened on Monday, and I stopped by on Thursday.  It sits in the parking lot of Castle Sports Club, conveniently, on my way to work. They have a pretty extensive menu, including the usual coffee and espresso items, along with some more unusual items, like energy drinks.  This location is (wo)manned by a couple of cute, smiling girls with trendy hair. One took my order, and the other made my americano. It was a pretty good price for a double - $1.75 or so. They were a little heavy-handed with the half and half, but that's forgivable.  While I was waiting for my beverage, I noticed they have several different specials throughout the week, including discounts on Tuesdays if you have their antenna topper on your car, and double punches on your punch card on Wednesdays.  My americano was pretty tasty, from what I could tell, underneath the cream. What I found really exciting was the cup. I know. I'm a dork.   But the lid was so cool! It has a little sliding door you sip out of, controlled by a built-in lever. Great one-handed control for driving, and it keeps the coffee from bubbling out when you're bouncing around on old leaf springs.   This place could so be a dangerous habit for me. Yeah, the Human Bean is a franchise. But it's not Starbucks.  EDIT 11/16/07: I had to come back and give them another star. I've been stopping by now on average twice a week. Now the girls know what I order.  This morning, the had it waiting for me when I got to the window. How awesome is that? Not only that, but because there was a "wait," and by "wait" I mean I was the 3rd person in line, they gave me an extra punch of my loyalty card. I'm only one away from a freebie, baby.  I'm lovin' this place!

2-4-1 -- that's all you need to know! 2-4-1's every day, 4-8pm, and they don't mess around. I have gone here three times in the past week to get my drink on. Does that make me an alkie? Maybe.  But anyway, you may remember that this is the former location of the Locker Room. These guys have done a fantastic job of classing up the decor. It's nice. Not cold and pretentious nice, but comfy and clean nice.  The old wooden bar has been replaced with a dark grey granite slab. The dart boards are gone. Now in that area, there are now some low, angular couches for conversation and looking pretty.   You'll also notice LOADS of flat panel TVs. Well, duh. It's a video bar! Sure, you've got the usual bizarre euro techno videos playing. Thankfully there are clips of TV shows and movies interspersed.  For instance, on comedy night, you're likely to see some bits from Will & Grace, SNL, and MadTV. Musicals night will have parts of The Sound of Music and Grease.  They've also added drag bingo on Mondays. It starts when 2-4-1's end, but they are replaced new drink specials. Plus, if you wear a big hat, you get dollar shots. Sometimes they offer them to you anyway, hat or not!   Of course, the bingo is fun too. $5 gets you 4 cards which you can re-use each round. Some prizes are a little lame, but others are pretty cool! The night I was there, the grand prize was tickets to see Eartha Kitt. I could pass on that. But I heard another time it was a trip to Rocky Point for Pride.  The more I go, the more I like Ice Pics. I guess because it's good for a person like me, who doesn't like to dance or schmooze. I like to drink and laugh. Ice Pics delivers on both counts.

True, the fish smell has arrived. But it really only hit me at the front door. After that, it faded.   Inside, the store is bright and clean and chock full of goodies! Sadly, I had just gone to Ranch Market, so I didn't need much in the way of Asian groceries. On the upside, I was in need of other international delights, in particular, passion fruit syrup (can't have a zombie without it!).  Turns out, I had my choice of a Sri Lankan variety, and one made in Hong Kong. I went with the former.  I also picked up some Jamaican ginger beer, that was good and spicy -- perfect for a Dark and Stormy. Plus it's way closer for me to go to Lee Lee instead of BevMo to get it = bonus!  I also noted super prices on meat and seafood. The frozen crawfish had me thinking, "crawfish boil!"   I consider my lesson learned. I don't need to be looking for Asian goods to come to Lee Lee!

Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink. There are 5 Starbucks within a 3 block radius of my work. Yet I am dying for a really good cup of coffee.  Earlier this week, I was feeling particularly antsy. I could see the sun shining outside my office window, and my booty had grown numb, planted in my office chair for four hours straight. Field trip!  I did a quick Yelp search to find the closest indie coffee joints, and Conspiracy came up, at .7 miles away. Ulgh, a 1.4 mile round trip walk.   But I went for it, and boy howdy am I glad I did! I was served possibly the best latte of my life. The espresso was layered with different tones and flavors. The froth was nice and dense, and even adorned with a lil frilly foo foo. I couldn't even bring myself to sully it with fake sweetener. It had to be real deal sugar. So. Good.  Sadly, I don't think I can make this trek often. But I will make a point of stopping in from time to time for a hit of the good stuff. In between, I'll be cast adrift in a sea of corporate coffee.

Hell yeah! What is it? The Wednesday after? And I'm still recovering! The parade was glittery gorgeous fun. Fun crowd, good groups at the festival. Plus, I won a big tube of fancy German lube!  I had a really good time, but it was mostly because of the people I was with, and that the last time I went was about 3 years ago. Three year intervals seem to work best for me, in order to prevent a bad case of been-there-done-that.

I'm always hunting for a good Cajun food place. After hearing about Chez Monieux, my Louisiana-raised GF, our Louisiana-native friend, and myself road-tripped across town to check it out.  It's true, it is difficult to find. But once we tracked it down, we did appreciate the French Quarter-like wrought iron exterior. We settled down inside, and ordered up some beer and grub.  Sadly, we were pretty unimpressed. Everything really lacked spice and flavor. The fried items were utterly caked in a thick doughy batter. Service was really slow.  Ah well. The search continues. However, I give them an extra star for the cute name.

I hate to jump on the bandwagon. But dang it, folks are right about this place!  We lurked around the front door this morning long enough for Mauricio to invite us in. Pizza A Metro sticks out like a sore thumb in this dirty old stripmall off the 17. It's clean and crisp on the outside, warm and inviting on the inside.   Soccer was on the tele, and the kitchen crew was busy prepping for the lunch rush. We sat at one of the granite-topped tables and ordered a few bevvies. FYI, sodas come in 20 oz bottles, so while they are tastier than fountain, they are a bit more money.  We started off with a caesar salad. The dressing was spot-on, with just the right amount of anchovy. However it had no croutons, and could use some bigger parm bits.  We also enjoyed some really tasty sorta bruschetta things. They appeared to be scraps of pizza crust, accompanied by a sweet onion relish with -- I believe -- eggplant, celery, and a couple of fat capers and olive slices. As an olive-hater, I found this to be a refreshing change from tapenade.  Next we had the lasagne and a small pizza with prosciutto, mozz, and arugula. The "small" was HUGE! The crust was kind of on the thin side, and had a delicious chewiness to crustiness ratio. On the downside, I totally got shafted on the arugula. Instead, it was topped with spring mix. Not bad, but the bite of arugula would have been better.  The lasagna was delish. The sauce was probably the best part - lots of tomato and basil, and just the right amount of garlic.  Sadly, I was too full and tired for dessert.   And good news for you Scottsdalians. We were told he's opening another shop up your way.

My lord. The barbequed meats are to die for. We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and sadly, they were sold out of the pork ribs. We went for just the pork. So glad we did. Sweet, spicy, smoky -- everyone was there.   We were seated near the pick up counter for bbq, and they were doing brisk business with the local Asian population. Every few minutes, someone would come by and order a duck, or a piece of pork. I am not at all surprised.  To follow, we ordered a medium egg drop soup. It was humungous! The fish bowl sized serving could have easily served four. It was also quite delicious. Good and eggy, without being goopy.  Finally, we enjoyed some beef chow fun with XO sauce. Oh my. It kind of reminded me of my beloved pad kee mao, without the Thai flavors of basil and anise. The dish consisted of broad rice noodles in a spicy brown sauce, with thin, tender slices of beef, and green onions. I wished I had more room in my belly in which to fit it.  In addition to our delicious entrees, the little things were just right too. The rice was perfectly sticky. The tea, warm and toasty. I think it might had been hoji-cha.   The icing on the cake was the bill. For such wonderful food, served in such generous portions, our bill was $31 for two people. Not only that, it's about 2 miles from my house. I am truly on cloud nine.

Ace really is the place. After hitting up the Home Despot for the second time in an hour, wandering the cavernous interior, looking for someone - anyone - who knows anything about screws, I found an associate who sent me to Ace.  Ace was the complete opposite experience. This location is brand spanking new. It is all clean and tidy, but their garden center is still empty. I walked in the front door and found six - count 'em - SIX employees ready to help. Unfortunately for them, I was the only customer.   One kind woman directed me to the aisle of screws and nails. Seriously, a whole big aisle of tiny drawers, neatly organized. I found exactly what I needed, for less than half the price of what you-know-who had. Not only that, the entire process was pain-free and included lots of smiles and pleasantries.  Man, I'm starting to sound like a fogey. Kids today!

Further confirmation that Ace freakin' rocks.  Last evening, I found myself in need of some eyebolts. Noting that it was just about closing time, I flew out the door, and headed to Ace.  When I arrived, they were shutting down, yet pried open the doors to let me in. The Helpful Hardware Man asked what I sought, led me right to the spot, and pulled down a couple eyebolts of the appropriate size.   As I wandered over to the register, I came to realize that I left in such a hurry, I neglected to put cash or plastic in my pockets. Embarrassed, I apologized, put the goods on the counter, and was ready to leave, empty-handed.  But the man just rang them up, handed them to me, and said that I owe them a buck .75, next time I'm in. (Which I intend to re-pay tomorrow.)  Sure, they don't carry lumber, or plants, or a huge selection of patio furniture. But Ace has all the basics, and their customer service is beyond stellar.

I swear this place has a tractor beam installed, that's programmed for my vehicle. Every time I'm within a two mile radius, I find myself at their door, thirsty for a honeydew boba tea.   If that isn't enough to make me completely blissful, I'll get a banh mi too. Too bad they don't seem to know what "no cilantro" means.

Eureka! At last, we have found the cajun food we have been long-seeking -- homey, authentic, real deal stuff. Not fancy foo foo "takes" on cajun food. Not watered-down,  dumbed-down versions of cajun food. Just the good, real, stuff, lovingly, and painstakingly prepared with quality ingredients.  Yes, the po' boys are good. The bread is spot-on, the ingredients cooked just right. Even the spicy tartar sauce (ya know, remoulade) is right. But po' boys aren't too much of a challlenge.  The entrees will make you or break you. Since I've only been once (so far!) I've only had opportunity to try the crab landry - garlic bread, sauced with crab stew, and topped with a few fried shrimp.  I could not stop tasting and analyzing that stew. It was full of layers of flavor - smoky, sweet, spicy, earthy, a slight hint of briny - all cooked down and blended into luscious deep brown brew of deliciousness!  The dining room has all the atmosphere of a hospital cafeteria. Can we get some music maybe, at least? But I can easily deal with that, for the sake of the food.

We went back of a long overdue visit, and were surprised to find that they really spruced up the place! They have expanded into the space next door, and dressed it up with bright colors, a fanciful bayou-themed mural, and tablecloths. Yes, there is even now some zydeco to serenade you while you eat.  As always, the food is just as good as I remembered. Maybe even better.

Our kitchen is torn apart, in the middle of a renovation. So last night, there we were again, hungry, and no way to cook. Delivery choices are limited in our area, unless you want pizza or Chinese.   We were pretty burnt out on both. But decided to go for pizza. I sifted through our stack of menus, and came across one for a place we'd never ordered from - Nick's.  I was pleased to find that, in addition to pizza, they offered pasta dishes, hot and cold subs, salads, and cheesesteaks for delivery. Score!  We ordered a meatball sub, a cheesesteak, and a caesar salad.   Delivery was fairly timely (way better than the 45 minutes Streets of New York delivery!). The goods were a pleasant surprise as well.  The caesar salad was HUGE! The round to-go container was jam-packed with romaine lettuce, parm, and croutons. Dressing was served on the side. Thank goodness for that, because we tucked right into the subs first, and were way too stuffed for salad afterwards. That left me with a huge salad to take to lunch the next day.   The subs were on a soft on the inside, crusty on the outside roll. The meatballs were nice and juicy, and with good flavor. You could tell it was made with mixed meats (ideally, beef, pork, and veal), as a good meatball should be made. The cheesesteak, on the other hand, was OK. The meat was rather salty, but otherwise good.   That tab wasn't too bad either - around $22. I would definitely order from them again.

The self-serve ordering process is neat-o and fast. But the food is not good -- at all.   I had the daal, which lacked any trace of flavor. Just imagine some lentils in a starchy, soupy goop. Some salt might have been nice, any seasoning really. It was barely edible, with a thorough dousing of Tabasco.  The naan was in insult to all that is naan. Instead of light, fluffy bread, with a crispy, slightly charred shell, I got a tough, greasy, tortilla-like thing, slathered in a butter-like substance.  Two stars for the concept and the really tasty iced tea.

I found myself with a couple hours of free time, during my work day. So I wandered out for a little walk -- even though it was 106 out. After 20 minutes of strolling and sweating, I found myself in front of Moira Sushi, just opening for lunch, as if it were meant to be.   After some welcome air-conditioning and ice water, I ordered up some seaweed salad, hamachi, and just for kicks, the quail eggs. All were delicious, refreshing, served with a smile, and for reasonable prices.  It's so nice to know that a great lunch can be had so close to work. While my colleagues are grazing on their bland $5 footlongs, I'll be noshing on some tasty goodies from the sea!

Thank goodness I am a total barfly. I was waiting for IcePics to open, and got tired of sitting in my car. So I decided to drive around the area.  Just a few doors down, I found Standard Restaurant Equipment. I did a Dukes of Hazzard-like screeching turn around a broken down bus and careened into the parking lot.  I love kitchen gear. But I am underemployed, and was afraid I'd spend a lot of money inside. But no.   Check it. For under $20, I got a half sheet pan (on sale for $6 -- down from $23!), 2 squeeze bottles (72 cents a piece!), a muddler, a turner, an ashtray, and a dough scraper.  Hell yeah! It's Williams-Sonoma for welfare losers like me.

Actually run by Aramark, this Starbucks is part of the Taylor Place shops of the downtown campur of ASU. Staffed by students, service is typically friendly, if a bit slow.   The real problem is they must be even more lackadaisical about cleaning the place. The coffee fixins station is always covered in crumbs and spills, the refrigerated foods cooler is scantily-stocked, and what's left is withered up and stale, and the bathroom is just downright nasty.  I shudder to think of the condition of the food and drink prep area.

I am so, SO happy that there are local coffee places popping up near my work. Until now, it's been the 'Bucks, wherever you turn.  I always get my coffee to go, so the interior isn't really a big concern of mine. The quality of the coffee is, and here, it's always top notch. The staff is very nice too.  Other perks -- they have punch card, and discounts for ASU and city employees. I'm neither. But on occasion, I answer the trivia question correctly, and get the discount that way.  I also like the fact that they make an effort to be more environmental. For instance, they use the recyclable cups, and spoons, rather than stirrers.

Yay - another indie coffee joint that's somewhat near work! Bonus, I can shop at the market at the same time. Well, sometimes. I usually go for coffee between 8:00 am and 9:00 am, and the market doesn't open until 11:00 am. But it happens once in a while.  Anyway, you can tell that Royal takes their coffee very seriously. Often, they have the roaster going out front. If you order drip coffee, be prepared to wait. They brew it right then, one cup at a time.  But it's worth it.   The espresso is also rich and delicious.  I made the mistake of going to back to Starbucks once, and the americano now tastes like ash in comparison. Royal has spoiled me!

The main benefit of this Goodwill is that it's large. That's a good thing, because at least 50% of what it contains is utter crap.   Really, they will put just about anything on the shelf. I've seen spaghetti sauce jars, canisters with no lids, broken electronics, you name it. Or sometimes items are priced for more than what they would cost new. $1.00 for a mason jar? Really?  Though, this is where I scored a Loverboy album, and a sweet American flag patterned vest for my Tea Party protestor costume.  Also, it's between Dollar Tree and Tuesday Morning. So you can get all your cheapo shopping done at once.

If the biggest coffee geek on the planet had a basement to himself, this is what he would create -- a lab, indeed. The coffee experts can get their rocks off on all the high tech brewing equipment, and the single-origin coffee, and food pairings, and what have you.   On the other hand, the dilettantes and casual coffee enjoyers can get an excellent brew, without too much condescension. Yes, you will get a cocked eyebrow and a gentle suggestion that you pass on the cream, or other additives.   But there is no sneering, and you will get your accoutrements if you ask for them. And you will have to ask, since they are stashed out of sight.  All is all, it's a cozy little lab to get your coffee geek on, no matter what end of the spectrum you hail from.

This place sketches me the hell out. But it's close to home. So I have wandered in, once or twice.  There's usually a random selection of clientele: a couple normal folks, some tweaker dude or chick (who might be your bartender), and some shady people.   What's behind the bar is really bizarre. In the whole thing, there are maybe 15 bottles. So they spread them reeeaaallly far apart. And in those 15 bottles, there is either nothing, or maybe 4 oz of liquor, which may or may not be watered down. I would stick to bottled beer.  Two stars for character (be it as it may), and for having a jukebox and a pool table. I also love the sign that says something to the effect of, "NO bicycles, weapons, children, or backpacks".

Looks like they re-arranged behind the bar. Now all of the bottles are compressed into one small section, and appear to be a little more full. Now, they other half is populated with many, many, many jars of peanuts.

This year, we sold the truck, and bought a slip -- probably the best investment ever.   What a pain it was, to load up the boat with coolers, hook up the trailer, tow the boat all the way the lake. All that gas we used. Then we had to wait to put in, and someone would have to park the trailer, like a mile away. Then we had to maneuver the boat to the ramp to pick up that poor soul. Then at the end of the day, do it all in reverse, and when we're tired, hungry, and sunburned.  Now it's drive the car to the lake, where the little golf cart whisks us down to the marina. There, we can pick up a cart for our stuff, which is minimal, since we keep the coolers on the boat. Grab some bags of free ice, stroll down to the boat, load up, cast off, and be gone!   When we come back, we just tie up again, grab our stuff, and hop on the shuttle back to our car. They even pick up your trash for you, when you leave the bag at the slip.  The marina itself has all the conveniences -- a store, gas, a restaurant and bar -- which are open to the public. Sometimes, the restaurant / bar has a band or karaoke. I'm usually too pooped at the end of the day to check it out. But it sounds like fun.  Plus, for members, there are also laundry and shower facilities, and a sort of rec room, with a bank of grills you can use. The staff are always friendly and helpful.  For us, it's really been worth every penny. We go to the lake a lot more often now, too, since we don't have to deal with all the stress.

This service is a blessing and a curse for our household. A blessing because they have delivered many a Sunday evening Tandoori Times 2 meal to us. A curse because all that delicious curry is making us fat!  Seriously though, I've never had a problem with these guys. Yes, their website is horrible to look at. But it does the job. We put in our order, and about 45 minutes later it arrives. We eat. End of story.

With a million kajillion 5 star reviews, Artie doesn't really need my help to boost his rep. But my experience was so positive, I just had to chime in.   He's always super duper busy, and for good reason. However, he managed to squeeze me in, and patch up what I effed up, and for a reasonable price.   Whether you need a leak fixed, or a whole bathroom remodel, Artie is your guy!

It's so nice to have a pool supply place near the house. Especially one that's not Leslies. Not that I have anything against Leslies. It just felt as if I had little choice, with one on every corner.  So far, I've only gone to Northwest Pool and Spa for a few basic supplies, primarily, liquid chlorine. They carry a brand called HASA. I've never heard of it before. But now I recognize their yellow crates in the back of pool maintenance pick up trucks all over town.  You buy a crate of 4 gallons, and then bring them back for a refill for about $13.00. That's a pretty good deal, and kind of enviro -- if it weren't for the fact that it's chlorine you're buying.

We have been taking my step-grandson here for about a month now. The reason we chose Phoenix Children's Academy is because they do more than watch and care for the children. They also educate them.   In our boy's age group, they are teaching things like shapes, colors, and sign language. In older groups, they are learning pre-school basics, plus things like Spanish and nutrition.   Every day, we get a report card, that details his nap times, what he ate, and any other relevant notes. We also get hand-outs that outline what he is currently learning, so we can continue the lessons at home.  The only thing I wish they would change is the food they serve. Since they have no commercial kitchen, they can only offer prepared foods. That can sometimes means things like chicken nuggets and American cheese sandwiches.   However, you do have the option to provide your own lunches. They provide a monthly menu, so you can see in advance if there is anything you would prefer your child not have.  All in all, we are happy with PCS, and so is the kiddo.

Honestly, I was being selfish, and held back on reviewing this one for a long time. Now that the cat's out of the bag, here goes.  I was in need of a freezer cart, and saw one of their ads on craigslist, advertising restaurant equipment. I thought I would take a shot, and see if they had one.  Sure enough, they had the perfect one, plus a few other possible contenders. Not only that, the place was jam-packed with used commercial kitchen equipment -- ranges, ovens, freezers, gigantic woks, deep fryers -- everything, and marked cheap.  In addition, there were tons of old tables, booths, small utensils, china, and heaps of randomness that I could not even describe. Sure, a lot of it is beat, dirty, and worn out. But there are gems within.  Also, there are what I assume to be construction leftovers outside. Just crate after crate of travertine, marble, granite, sandstone. Perfect for small jobs like a bathroom or a patio. I picked up two slabs to use as pizza stones ($2 each), and I got the pizza peel there too.   If you happen to go, and see something you like, find out if they have an auction coming up. I ended up buying my cart through the auction, and it saved me about $30.   There it is. Hope you're happy now.

I am THAT salon customer. The one who tsks and tuts, and hrms like Marge Simpson when my stylist is done. Just, not satisfied.   I ask if my stylist can re-shape here, or fiddle with that bit. Then, still, more hrming and squinting in the mirror.  After about thirty minutes of tweaking and adjusting, and still not being happy, I give up, say thanks, and never come back.  Thanks to Shauna, I WAS that customer. After only a brief discussion of what I wanted, she set to work, and there it was -- done. She managed to translate my inarticulate stylistic needs into the perfect style for me, in one shot, no hand-holding needed.  Now what will do with me time in the chair? I suppose, read magazines, like everyone else.  Other details: This is a one chair operation. So you might have to wait. Spend your time browsing the clothes and accessories in the vintage shop section of the shop.

Without a doubt, the best catfish and greens in town. The catfish is clean-tasting and moist, the cornmeal coating is crispy and delicious. The greens are tender, but not soggy and cooked to death, there's still some "tooth" to them. Plus they have a little heat in the background.

Stopped in for a hot drink. I got a chai tea. Unfortunately, it tasted a bit like Vick's Vaporub smells. I dumped it into the trash bin and filled it with coffee from the carafes. The coffee was on par with QT coffee, which was a vast improvement over the chai.  On the other hand, the baked goods looked delish. The sandwiches and salads that passed by me also looked rather tasty. However, since I didn't actually try them, I can't say for sure.  Nonetheless, I think this is a good addition to the Arizona Center -- a nice choice for a quick and fresh lunch.

We have a problem pool. It's large, old, deep, and surrounded by trees. It's a formula for a green pool.   We struggled with the algae for the first year after we moved in. Bought loads of chemicals, got analysis after analysis done.   Still, by July, it was green, and stayed that way the rest of the summer - gross and unswimmable.  There comes a point when you admit failure, bite the bullet, and go to the experts.  Serkland's fits the bill. They are affordable, reliable, and know what they're doing. Since hiring them, it's been crystal blue waters all summer long.  Plus our guy loves dogs, and brings treats for them every time he comes. Can't beat that!

After attempting to register the old motorcycle I bought from out of state at two other places -- including an actual MVD office -- and being unsuccessful for some dumb reason another, my hopes weren't too high for this place.  I was very pleasantly surprised! They handled my odd registration with ease and a smile. It was well worth the $20 convenience fee.
