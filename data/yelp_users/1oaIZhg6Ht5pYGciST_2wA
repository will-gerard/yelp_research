Don and/or Charlie-will you marry me?  This place is bomb.com. Don't question, just wear stretchy pants and come hungry!

Had a shirt taken to them to be serviced three times, and still they did not dry-clean it. I would hav been better off doing it myself in my sink at home.

Todd was a stand up dude. Very friendly, and efficient. The dealership quoted me for a sensor key at $800. His price was $170. Cheaper than the locksmith that triple A referred as well.

What is this.....a taco for ants?!  I wish I could give this place a 5 star rating because boy do I love me some good Mexican food, but I just can't do it.   Their tacos are like wee little babies and the chicken pieces are bite size, like safe enough for an infant with no teeth to eat.   For the price def not worth it. I much prefer to throw down on some Wadda's tacos in old town where each bite is worth every penny.   Now I will say-they are not lacking in the refried beans department. Not sure if crack is their secret ingredient but uhhh, I'm addicted.    So if you go-order the beans and order ten tacos so it's basically like 3 normal tacos. But those beans doe.

Oh and they don't serve alcohol anymore. Like what?

I made an appointment after reading the positive reviews, so I made an appointment the same day. I was compelled to write a positive review after the reading. I've had over a handful of readings in my life, and have grown to become a bit skeptical. All she asked for was an item of mine, my name, and birth date. She didn't ask questions to get a better understanding, but went on with her reading. She did a tarot reading and was on point. Some things she brought up were relevant today, and other information was relevant to the future. I left feeling good, and as if she wasn't BS-ing me. I highly recommend you give her a try, even for the skeptics. You may just leave a new believer ;-)

The pretzels..... are tantalizing. I dream of them. I often find myself in a daze under the spell/thought of these babies.  Everything is made from scratch! Scratch! Not frozen...but fresh!   I dig it. And you will too. I highly reccoemend giving this place a go.

This place obviously has not mastered the art of customer service or even remotely understands what that means servicing paying customers. I walked in at 6:20pm and got turned away because they close at 7, and nobody wanted to stay late......like what? This place is close to my new house and they basically just lost a repeat customer. So dumb.
