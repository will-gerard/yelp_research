I came here once for a friend's birthday party, and I won't be coming back. The food was medicore, the service was lousy and it took forever to receive our food and check.  On top of that, we were a big party (meaning we would leave a huge tip regardless). Despite that, we were hardly attended. They were more occupied chatting with guys at surrounding tables. And yes, we were a huge group of mostly girls, however we should have been attended more frequently. I was really hoping it didn't have that "Hooters male service first only" stigma but it did. The only other place I haven't experienced that is at the Tilted Kilt downtown (props to that place).  Anyways, I would not recommend this place. Go to Tilted Kilt instead.

Great food, quaint mom-and-pop atmosphere and friendly staff. Also, they serve a lot for the prices!  I live down the street and I'm looking forward to taking my family and friends here.  It's great that there's more food diversity in the Melrose District with the opening of this restaurant.   Welcome to the neighborhood!
