Very impressed with the pasta special. Big portions and quality food.  The live music was a perfect volume and waiters were very attentive.  The only complaint that I have is the mediocre seating.   I would recommend this to anyone craving Italian food.

I had some red haired younger girl that had piercings. I told her that I wanted my hair a little bit darker for the fall. She assured me it wouldn't be too drastic at all. I have naturally light blonde hair.  I left the salon with almost black hair. What a waste of $200 and a few hours.   My hair was also very greasy when I left.  So I am currently at another salon getting a color correction. Thanks for nothing.

Ok gel manicure. The whole process took way too long and I was left with nothing special. The awkward small talk really made things that much worse. To top it off it was way more expensive than most of the places I go to.   I will not be returning.

Great place to sit (on the patio) and enjoy coffee/gelato with someone, intimately -- if the weather permits. Really pleasant place to chill; music is good to boot!

The staff is always friendly here! I love the big selection of teas they offer and my coffee always comes out exactly how I want it.  My only complaint is the wait. It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to make a latte when there is no one ahead of me.  A good spot to study or visit with someone.

I'm in the United States on a p-1 exceptional athlete visa for show jumping. My goal is to represent Canada in both the Pan American games as well as the olympics. Both my horses and I train very hard. I heard excellent things about EXOS and figured it could be a great addition to my training regime. I called EXOS about 3 times and left voice mails. No answer or returned calls. I then obtained a business card and called a trainers personal number and left a  voice mail- again, no returned call. I was very excited to be a part of team EXOS but I guess the feeling isn't mutual. I wouldn't waste your time calling them...

Perfect place for the adventurous palette.  The three course meal was prepared exceptionally and left me satisfied. Not too much food or too little.  The chef's attention to detail and use of seasonal ingredients made for an excellent dining experience.  Well worth the price.
