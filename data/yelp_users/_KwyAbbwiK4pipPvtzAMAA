I've been meaning to take my beau to Firebirds for months and I finally got a chance to treat him yesterday. Firebirds was everything I expected.   I made reservations for 6pm for the two of us and there was absolutely no wait, especially since we got there early. Our waitress was really sweet. She had only been there a few days but was very prompt and sweet.   We ordered the Sex and the Queen City martini and the Watermelon Margarita. Both were delicious and not very sweet.   We ordered the chicken quesadilla, the prime rib, and the ribeye. The quesadillas came out very quickly. It was very fresh and had a southwestern kick to it which I loved. The prime rib and ribeye came out a few minutes after. We barely got a chance to finish our quesadillas.   The prime rib was pretty massive. I didn't get a chance to finish it especially after stuffing my face with bread and quesadillas. It was cooked perfectly though and seasoned very well. I suggest getting the au gratin potatoes as well. They were delicious!   The beau's ribeye was cooked perfectly. He enjoyed it very much. There was so much food he didn't even get a chance to tackle his loaded baked potato which looked phenomenal.   There is absolutely nothing I can complain about about my experience at Firebirds. It was a lovely time and I look forward to going back!

I've gone here many a times and Famous Dave's never disappoints! Service is quick and the beers are good.  The beau and I usually split a rack of ribs and sides. Usually it's big enough so we're happily full and we still have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.  Their sauces are like crack. My favorite is Devil's Spit. I even bought a bottle to take home.   I recommend Famous Dave's any time you want a chill night out or some good ol' BBQ.

So we just left Treasures on our last night in Vegas. We had a party bus drop us off for no charge and the two drink minimum was fine and easily understandable. Drinks were strong. The girls were sweet and very talented. So why the two stars?  My beau went up to a girl to try to get his friend a dance and on his way up, he accidentally dropped his winnings from earlier that night. Before I had a chance to even say anything, a girl ran over and picked it up and ran back to some dude's lap. I confronted her about it and she was about to give it back to me when some senior stripper told me "any money on the floor is fair game". And the girl stuck the money back in her purse.  I was having an absolutely amazing time until then. We left right after that, there's no reason to give any more money to thieves.   Watch your back when you're there.

Yummy yummy in my Filipino tummy!  I was so stoked to find this little gem close to ASU West. I've been deprived of great Filipino food since moving to AZ but this place felt like home.  I walked in before class to grab a quick snack. I ordered two siopao (pork buns) and a mango juice. The service was really quick. And I got everything within minutes. The siopao came with a bit of the pork gravy to dip it in. Oh man, it was drippy, sticky and oh so good. It made me miss my mommy's cooking. The mango juice was refreshing and went well with my meal.  I almost can't wait to go back to school on Monday so I can make another pit stop there.

Coming from NYC where greasy Chinese food is on every block and at your door within minutes, Big Buddha lies pretty low on my fast food scale.  I've only tried a handful of Chinese restaurants in Surprise and Big Buddha is by far my least favorite. I ordered the beef chow fun and garlic chicken on Saturday night and both were sub-par.   The beef chow fun was not good. The noodles stuck together and the veggies didn't seem fresh. It also tasted like someone just dunk a ton of soy sauce over the flat noodles. It was not appetizing at all.  My beau ordered the garlic chicken and it was not spicy whatsoever even though I asked them to make it spicy.   If you're looking for good Chinese food, I suggest Chen Wok. They're delicious and deliver!

I've had Takamatsu's bookmarked since I moved to AZ a couple of months ago. Over the weekend, I finally got to try it out and boy was it an experienced.  We walked in for lunch on Saturday. It was pretty empty. The waitress was really friendly and took our order right away. We had the seaweed salad, spicy beef bulgogi and the pork katsu with two large Sapporo's to wash it down with.   The seaweed salad was fresh and tasty. A pretty good portion size too.  The pork katsu was good. It was a bit bland for my taste though. Another downside to the katsu, I found a plastic cap? in my dish . That was dissatisfying. The waitress said it must've accidentally come off the sauce jar. They apologized and didn't charge me for my liter Sapporo's though, so it wasn't that bad.   The spicy beef bulgogi is probably the best bulgogi I've ever had. It was the beau's dish, so I had to sneak in my bites. It was also a pretty large portion, so it could have been easily been shared.   Despite my plastic cap experience, I'd give Takamatsu another shot just for the bulgogi goodness alone.

I came here for a girls night out and it was fantastic! Happy hour cocktails were delicious! Their sour apple martinis were just $5 and gave us girls a good buzz.   Their sushi is amazing and fresh. I'm happy to finally find a good sushi restaurant in Arizona.   The service could've been a bit more prompt and the food could've came out quicker. But the waitress was really nice and overall we had an amazing start to our night here.  I will be back soon !

After getting our furry monster AJ, we took every precaution necessary to make sure our little guy was happy and healthy. White Tanks made sure he was!  The staff and doctors here are absolutely wonderful. They answered every question we had and didn't rush us out like most vet offices. Also they are reasonably priced, offer a military discount, and a no interest payment plan.  You won't find a better animal clinic out there, White Tanks Animal Hospital is the only place to go!

Waking up after a loooooong night of partying in Vegas, my friends and I needed greasy food to cure our hangovers. I turned on Yelp, and BAM there's Coco's right down the block from our hotel. I called immediately and they were crazy busy (apparently everyone else was also hungover). It took about 15 minutes for me to place an order to pick up since it was so loud and they had just changed their menu.  15 minutes later, we dig into our well deserved meal. It was perfect. I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs. The corned beef hash was much better than I expected. It had flavor (although it could've used some hot sauce) and the eggs were poached nicely too. It didn't come with any toast so I ordered a couple of biscuits. They were not good. Avoid if you can. Otherwise, my friends all dug into the pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage and there were zero complaints.  Coco's was reasonably priced and delicious. If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind stopping back in for another hungover breakfast cure.

I'm still not used to these west coast prices... I yearn for my cheap $20 mani/pedis that lasted for weeks in NYC. But I was in desperate need of a nail job, and Yelp brought me to this fabulous gem.  Dream Nails is tucked away in a small complex next to Fitness 1 and White Tanks Animal Hospital. It's around the corner from my house which made it even better.  I called ahead for an appointment because when I tried to walk in last week there was a ridiculous 45 minute wait. This time around I only waited for about ten minutes before being seated in their comfy massage chairs. They quickly gave me a water and went to work. And the results were amazing.  The pedicure was quick and relaxing. I did their basic Spa Pedicure which included a massage. It was great. The tech that worked on me knew exactly what she was doing. I also had a gel manicure. It was easy and the girl did a great job. I hope these last for a few weeks.   My only gripe is the prices. I guess they've increased them since they are not the same as what is listed on their website. Gel Manicure ($30) + Spa Pedicure ($20) = $50 plus tip. It's kind of steep but I was desperate and they did a great job,  I'll be back!

The beau and I stopped by on a whim whilest exploring our new city and it's probably the best find so far.   Walking in for a late dinner we were happily greeted and easily seated. Service was prompt and pleasant. We ordered some garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and chicken vidaloo. All came out within 10 minutes and boy was it amazing! The tikka masala was creamy and fresh. My beau ordered his vidaloo spicy, and it was the perfect amount of spicy.  We've been back at least 8x since and always end up happily full. (ITIS!)  I can't wait to try the lunch buffet!

I've been searching for a reputable carpet repair and cleaner and came across Phoenix Carpet Repair & Cleaning. They did an absolutely fantastic job!  Kim was sweet, and worked with me finding a time that would work best for us.   Our technician, Jason was great. He arrived on time and got straight to work. He was very knowledgeable about the carpet that was in our home. He repaired a few things and cleaned everything in two hours flat.   Our home looks brand new! I highly recommend Phoenix Carpet Repair & Cleaning!

Before leaving Vegas, I was determined to try Holsteins. It's very hard to get a decent burger out in Surprise, AZ and as a burger    connoisseur I felt it was my mission to taste and to yelp. So I did. And it was spectacular.  Holsteins is located inside the Cosmopolitan and easy to get to. We were seated within 20 minutes and served almost immediately.  I didn't try their bamBOOZLE shakes (although I plan to next time) but a friend got their regular shake and it was great.   Each one of us got a different burger and were def not keen on sharing as it was tooooo good to not eat the whole thing. I got the Gold Standard burger with reg fries. It was cooked to a perfect medium and so juicy (that my mouth is watering as I type). The goat cheese and arugula really made it a tasty burger.  My beau got the Nom Nom burger. I'll never forget the way his face lit up when he took that first bite. He said it's one of the best burgers he's ever had. As a fellow burger connoisseur, he must mean business. It was cooked a little well for his taste but man that Kobe beef is bomb diggity. I highly recommend subbing your side for onion rings. I found myself sneaking a few fried rings whenever he was in the midst of mouth-gasm.   The burgers + drinks were a bit pricey but well worth it for the quality of the meal. This is def the best burger joint in Vegas. Holla!

I've been to the Arrogant Butcher twice, and both times have been phenomenal.  I've never had a problem getting a seat during lunch. The hostesses are really sweet and service is always prompt.   I suggest getting the pretzels with the provolone fondue. I made the mistake of filling up on it before my meal but it was SO WORTH IT. I also suggest trying the shrimp appetizer. It was also very good.  I had their burger which was cooked to perfection. My girlf had their fish and chips, also amazing. My beau loves their beer cocktail, the long legged blonde. Its the perfect summer time drink.   I have nothing negative to say about the Arrogant Butcher, except I wish it was a bit closer to me.

After being to almost every decent restaurant in Surprise, the beau and I wanted to try something different. So it was a nice SURPRISE (haha get it?!) that Yelp led me to this neighborhood gem.  Being a native New Yorker, it was nice walking into this deli and seeing Times Square on the wall and photos of the Flatiron building. It reminded me of home. We ordered the BBQ burger and a Philly Cheesesteak. The BBQ sauce on the burger was amazing and the fries were crisp. The potato salad was OK and the Philly cheesesteak was a bit salty.  Other than that, New York Flavor has become one of my favorite restaurants in Surprise. I plan on coming back and trying the Basil Mascarpone burger next!

Since leaving NYC, I've tried to indulge in all things that reminded me of home. Mister Softee was the epitome of a NYC summer. There was nothing like running around in the sprinklers and hearing that unavoidable ice cream truck song. So when an email circulated the office, "MISTER SOFTEE IS OUTSIDE NOW!". Not five seconds later did I snatch up my wallet and race my way to the elevator. It was like I was seven again.  I get to the window and immediately ask for my usual... "A rainbow sprinkle cone please!" It was just like a remembered. Soft served vanilla ice cream, rolled in rainbow sprinkles on a cone, so simple but so NYC.  That'll be FOUR DOLLARS. Damn... nostalgia is costly, but I'd pay anything (sorta) for that perfect cone.

I have been craving a good burger for a few weeks now and living in Surprise, there are slim pickins. However, after a quick yelp search the beau found Marleys just 10 minutes away from us who boasted the best burgers in Surprise. So of course, I had to go.  It was pretty quiet on a Thursday night. We were seated right away. Our waiter was nice but service was a tad slow. We both ordered burgers. My beau had the jalapeno burger while I went for the bbq bacon cheeseburger.   Their beer menu is pretty small. Mostly domestics, nothing too appealing. However, the rest of their food menu is pretty extensive. Definitely worth a look next time.  The burgers came out in about 15 minutes and were very good. Definitely the best I've had in Surprise. It was obvious that the patties were hand crafted and not frozen at all. I highly suggest swapping out fries for onion rings. They were perfectly crisp.  Btw - Marley's closes pretty early for a bar and restaurant. They close at 8pm so I'd def get my butt in there early if you're craving a good burger!

It's become tradition to stop by Sunsational Coffee before taking our little pooch to the dog park every weekend. The drive thru is great. Everyone's really nice and gets our order out within just a few minutes. Their coffees are really strong, just the way I like it! And our pup,  AJ already knows to stick his head out of the window for his dog biscuit.  Kudos for the military discount and loyalty stamps that earn me a free drink after every 10.   Best little cafe in Surprise!

Being a resident of Surprise for only a couple of months, it's so great to be able to mingle with neighbors and dogs from all over.   I bring my furry monster, AJ here every weekend so he can let off some steam and play with some of his friends. Everyone here is pretty nice and well aware of their dogs. They'll clean up after their dogs and make sure they're not doing anything inappropriate. However, there are the select few people who don't and that causes an issue or two.  They recently opened the park back up after a couple of weeks of renovating. It still looks the same but I'm not sure if there's something wrong with the sprinkler system because there have been really bad mud puddles these past two weekends.  So bring your furry monster! and some extra towels too.

I've caught a cold or something from somewhere and have been dying for some soup to help. In comes Pho A.V. to save the day!  It's a small little mom & pop restaurant. The owners don't speak English very well, but they do know how to make a mean pho. Their menu is pretty extensive but so far I've just had their amazing pho.  I came in for lunch last week. I sat down with no problem and was waited on promptly. I order the combination pho. It came with all the dressings on the side. Everything was delicious! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough tripe.  I've been back once or twice since. Totally inexpensive and so so delicious!  Pho for the win!

Being away from Momma's cooking has made me homesick and crave the greasy deliciousness of Filipino food. Unfortunately, Pinoy Bistro didn't rise to the occasion.  I walked in yesteday evening to order some food to go. There was no one at the front and it took a few minutes before someone came over to me. The waitress was nice but you can tell she was new. She didn't know much about the menu. When I asked her how many sticks come with their pork bbq entree, she had to go back to the cook and ask. Odd. I placed an order of lechon kawali and pork bbq. I ran to Sprouts in the meantime, but when I came back almost a half hour later the food still wasn't done.  After another 10 minutes, I got my food and went on my merry way. The meal was mediocre at best. The lechon kawali wasn't what I expected. It was 6 pieces of fried pork and a cup of rice. $8 for 6 pieces? It wasn't work it. The pork bbq was good but only two sticks is not worth the $7.  Overall, I might go back just because it's the closest Filipino restaurant to me. But I wouldn't expect much more than average.

Bootleggers was the perfect place to go after a long, dragging Monday. My beau picked me up from work and we got there just in time for happy hour.  I highly recommend getting their pulled pork sandwich as a happy hour treat. They were delicious. The brioche bun was delicious and pork was succulent.  For my happy hour cocktail, I got the blueberry brumble and the beau got their Catdaddy Old Fashion. The brumble was delicious and very refreshing. The Old Fashion was a tad on the sweet side.  We also ordered dinner there. I went for their Monday night special, Fried Chicken & Waffles while the beau had their ribs. The Chicken & Waffles were good, it was just a bit too sweet for me. My beau had the ribs which were very very good. I snuck a couple of pieces myself.   Kudos to the waiter who gave us a military discount too, I'm not sure if they do that often.  Overall, Bootleggers is a great place to stop by after work for a good drink and some good ol ribs.

I've had Litchfield Taproom bookmarked for some time and over the weekend I was finally able to check it out. It's amazing to have a great craft brewery so near to home.  Litchfield Taproom is a bit small so I wouldn't recommend huge groups but it's perfect for small parties craving some lunchtime craft brews. We decided to get a flight of beers to get a taste of which we'd like the most.  My favorites were the Haboob Black IPA and the Arsonist Amber. The beau enjoyed the Haboob as well and the Red Ale.  We ordered food there too. It was a small menu of brats, grilled cheese, and a meat and cheese plate. We split the grilled cheese and brats and both were delicious. Don't skimp out on the onions!  I look forward to coming back here and trying their chocolate stout.

After scouring Yelp for places to take my craft beer lovin' girlfriend for her going away dinner, I ended finding Draft House and it was absolutely perfect.   We rolled in at about 8:15pm on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. This place is HUGE. Two levels with a couple of pool tables, darts, and shuffle board. The beer selection is ridonkulous. 96 beers and a full bar to quench every alcoholic's thirst.   Our waitress was my least favorite part of the night. Immediately, you could tell that she didn't want to be there. She was unpleasant and not very friendly at all. She basically took our order and sauntered off.  The food however was amazingggg. My beau and I had the sliders (cheeseburger & cheesesteak) and both were fantastic. My girls had the grilled cheeses and a caprese salad, all very very good.   Overall, Draft House is pretty dope. The drinks were good, the beer selection was obviously up to par. I look forward to coming back here with my beer guzzlin' peeps and shooting some pool soon!

So I like meat (har-har). I wouldn't call myself a bbq connoisseur but I do enjoy good ribs when I get the chance to. When a friend dragged my beau and myself here last night, I was a bit skeptical but the minute I walked in, I couldn't help but salivate at the smell of all the barbeque.   They offered us a sample when we got to the register of the brisket and turkey. Both were mighty tasty. The brisket was fantastic. I got the cutter's choice, but next time I think I'd go with the moist. My beau got the ribs which were pretty fantastic too. We dosed our meals in their bbq "sause" and it was amazing, really tasty with a spicy kick at the end. I also recommend getting their potato salad, so good.  Don't forget to ask for your military discount while you're there!   Easy to say, I'll be back (for meat).

The way Maid by Design conducts business is absolutely appalling.   First, it is damn near impossible to get in contact with anybody. I tried for 2 weeks before someone finally got back to me. And it was via text message or email. I have not been able to speak to a live person.  Secondly, despite "being on the schedule" for my appointment today. They never showed up. I called numerous times today, again to no avail.  Lastly, when someone finally answered the phone today, I was hung up on.   I would avoid this business AT ALL COSTS. I've already reported them to LivingSocial and I don't expect their business to be around much longer.   AVOID MAID BY DESIGN. You've been warned.

Thank you Yelp for introducing me to the awesome spin class at The Madison. I attended the Yelp Event a few weeks back and have come back to the Madison a few times since then, and I foresee more classes in the near future.  Parking is so easy here. Plenty of spaces or if you feel fancy, complimentary valet. The space is chic and the staff is so helpful. Classes are inexpensive especially if you're a student like myself.   Upstairs in the Spin Room of Pain, you'll burn off those Superbowl calories like nobody's business. Keeks and DJ are both amazing instructors. They'll push you through those difficult sprints. Your slim thighs will thank you for it later.  I can officially say I'm hooked on a spin high. Can't wait to get my next fix at the Madison.
