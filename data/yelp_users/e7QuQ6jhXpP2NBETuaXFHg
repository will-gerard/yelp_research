Ordered a ton of food, problem is that if you want variety the cost does add up. Guy made me yell my order like 100 times but it got here in a timely manner and was delicious

I've used these guys numerous times, I used to really like them, this however is the 2nd time they've been more then an hour late. I work full time so my schedule is really important. If you say you will be here at 8 am I need you here at 8 am not 9:30. The cleaning they do is great, I think a lot of companies will clean well though, I need to find one that is on time so I don't have to call in to work to wait for a cleaner to come by.
