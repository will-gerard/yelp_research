Work done was acceptable, though it will take a repeat visit to correct the mishung towel rack and towel dispenser that is falling off my wall. The patch work was as expected, though a little pricey given the size of the repair. Be prepared to have this be an all day event, to hang a TV, hang two towel racks and a TP dispenser and patch 5 2x6" drywall holes took from 8am-245pm.   The main gripe was how the job was handled afterwards. I told the guy that did the work to just send me an invoice and I'll take care of it.  Between that day 11/29 and today I've had:  2 invoice payment requests A text message 2 phone calls  All demanding payment. I understand as a small business you don't have unlimited funds but I've worked with contractors before and I've never been hassled for payment like this in any respect, especially not over $341.  I really hope that treating me like a scumbag that doesn't pay his bills was worth it. I had requested an estimate to have a window busted out, the header raised and a sliding glass door installed that quoted $2,700 in labor. I was going to ask you to do that next week, but I will have to vote with my wallet and go elsewhere.  So to summarize, yes they will do the job, and do it reasonably well. I was not blown away by it and I had to clean up the mess (there was overspray all over my electronics from the texturing) but it was reasonable. God forbid you don't pay him IMMEDIATELY ON THE SPOT.  So there you go Eli, I just finished paying your invoice while I'm in the office. You have been paid your $341 immediately at the cost of a future job and a good review.
