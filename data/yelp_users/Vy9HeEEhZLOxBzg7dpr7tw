Quick, guess who I am...  "That was faxed to you over half an hour ago!" "Just give me ten minutes"  ........ Over 46 minutes later, still sitting here.. No one else.. Just me..   You guessed it, I'm the Walgreen's Pharmacy on 3rd Street and Bell..  It's been 49 minutes now.. And she needs a couple more minutes..  Now it's been 55 minutes.. And everyone has disappeared..  59 minutes and I'm walking out the front door. I feel so free!!!!

... I've been to this particular Macayo's multiple times without any issue. I'm basing this review off our last visit on Saturday. The waitress was so amazing that she drained my wallet of any and all remaining dollars! Haha!  I ordered the chicken California burro which is a staple whenever I visit and my husband had the variety sampler of the enchiladas! He never finishes his food (ever) and he gobbled it all up! I love my CA burro because it tastes fresh and it's big enough to take half home.. But I normally push myself a little too hard to finish it all in one sitting! Ha!  Last visit was 5 stars, but giving a 4 because we normally visit in a larger group and it can be difficult for staff to accommodate 10 or more.

We called for a 530 reservation. Arrived around 515 and seated at 535 ish.. I was worried it would be around 6 since typically even having a reservation somewhere doesn't help much. Anywho, service was great, good was great.. Husband ordered the 9 ounce filet mignon and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and fries! Steak was amazing - which should make me give them one star for giving my husband the idea that I might be able to cook a steak that way! Haha!   I'm surprised we've never been here before! We will definitely be back! Yum!

... Since everyone's taste is different, this place didn't suit me or my husband. That being said, maybe you'll enjoy it...?? We visited Hawaii for our honeymoon and saw an L&L there, as well, and remembered our experience at the Happy Valley location and it was enough to warrant not visiting a potential original location..... Meh. Again, maybe you'll find it more enjoyable, but we won't be back.. It's kind of an inside joke when we drive by actually..

I used to really enjoy this restaurant..... In high school 10 years ago.. We recently made a special visit to celebrate a birthday with a party of 13.. When we called to make a reservation, they informed us that they didn't make them.. So we showed up half an hour earlier than we wanted to make sure our party could get a table only to find out that apparently a party that large required a reservation and the wait was over an hour.. When I asked who answered the phones the young idiot lady said it's always different.. I asked her to explain herself about reservations and she sounded like she was high with her explanation of that they sometimes make them and sometimes don't and tonight they had 4 but sometimes don't use them.. I told her she made absolutely no sense at all!!! It was embarrassing to listen to her speak.. Half of out party had arrived by this point and we called Top Shelf down the street and they said they could get us right in so we told them we were leaving and were not happy with their service and they didn't care.. At any rate, we walked in the door at Top Shelf with 13 people (two children) and were seated right away.. Unacceptable.. No matter if their restaurant is always busy or not, this should have been rectified prior to us leaving..

... We walked in on a Saturday around 5 and were seated right away! Thank goodness because I was so HUNGRY! Service was the best we've had anywhere in quite a while and portions had me STUFFED! Had to take home half of my burger! We will definitely be back, even if we have to wait for a table next time /)

Good food and service.. Only drawback is they need more space! Lines get a little long so be prepared..

I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but health conscious when I can be. I loved the new foods and different flavors. If I can back, it would have to be without my husband since he was less than sold on the place.. Loved the flavored water!

DO NOT GO HERE!!  I brought my black lab in because she was vomitting and was all around not feeling well.  They performed X-Rays and said she didnt have bloat - but then told me there was SOMETHING in her stomach and surgery was needed right away! My boyfriend asked Dr. Lunt if it could be dog food, grass or hair in her stomach and in the x-rays. He said NO and that he had "never seen anything like this before".  They took her into surgery at 4:40 a.m. and didn't even call me like they said they would.  Guess what they found in her stomach? DOG FOOD AND GRASS at a whopping $2,300 later!  WOW!   Their customer service is TERRIBLE!  I dropped off a letter to them requesting a refund and the Dr. (Jessica) said "this will probbaly just end up in the trash"..    PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!!  Your best friend will thank you!!

DO NOT GO HERE!!   I wouldnt even give it one star.. They charged me $2300 because Dr. Lunt INSISTED that something was in my dog's stomach and showed us the X-Rays and showed us why it WASNT DOG FOOD, GRASS OR HAIR! He said "I have never seen anything like this before."  After they performed the surgery without calling me first as they promised they would, Dr. Lunt said he found grass and dog food in her belly - THAT'S IT!!  When I wrote a letter asking for a refund, Dr. (Jessica) said "This letter will probably just end up in the trash." - WOW!!  I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH - if you want to keep your pets healthy AND have money in your bank still - DO NOT GO HERE!!

... Stopped in today looking for bathroom fixtures before we stopped at Home Depot to purchase a utility sink we had our eye on.. While I didn't find anything to take home for the bathroom, we found the exact same utility sink for $40 less!!!! I would have given 5 stars but once we got the box home we realized the legs were warped out of place. Luckily, my husband is pretty handy and can heat it back in place. We should have checked prior to leaving, but having never been there before, maybe possibly informed that we should open the box because it might be defective..?? At any rate, I did find a tub we liked so once we're ready to move forward with that project, we'll be back AND more informed to check, double check and triple check the product before leaving.

I love everything about Smash Burger.. EXCEPT that time I asked for the Veggie Frites raw and NOT flash fried and they refused to serve them to me, which just tells me they're frozen and never fresh.. But who goes to a burger place for healthy sides, huh? But seriously, that's the only draw back, you can get a super healthy smash chicken sandwich then blow it by adding Veggie Frites.. Darn it all! It doesn't stop me from going though.. YUM! And, bonus, we get coupons all the time by email or by completing an online survey, and they'll let you use two per purchase since we would normally just pay for two meals separately anyway to take advantage of two coupons.. Ha!

... My husband and I have been here twice so far since it's down the street from our new house and we LOVE it! The food is great, good portion and prices, and I don't feel like staff is frustrated at me for asking for a side of ranch!! Haha! It's a cheat meal for me so I'm not here often but when I am, the meal fills me up to the brim!!!

Beautiful restaurant.. Poor service.. We waited our entire meal to get a glass of water.. And I feel like I must have gotten the bottom of the barrel chicken because it was fatty and very chewy. In short, I just told my fiancé that this place has ruined the thought of eating chicken for a while.. High hopes.. Sad face.. We won't be coming back.. I don't want to risk another terrible meal!

Anyone who have this place more than 1 star was obviously drunk and not remembering accurate information. One, good luck parking. The parking is so shitty they have a complimentary valet. Unless you get there at 7:15 apparently and their lots are full so you drive around with everyone else looking for a spot and dodge the police cars waiting for you to park in a no parking residential. After parking roughly a marathon away, we made it inside.. The place looks super fun, right? Games, young crowd.. Snazzy! Unless you want a drink or to eat something. I met with my SEATED party and waited for our server.. Waited and waited and waited.. Until my fiancé went to the bar and stood in line forever and game back with $10.29 worth of a plastic cup or vodka redbull.. Ummmmmm! Nice! So, one we found out we had a waitress, about 30 minutes into having sat down, we asked for a menu.. 19 minutes later (yes, I time wait staff when I think I'm going to need to complain), she came back with our tables drinks and asked what we had "we asked for a menu so we could eat.." Fail.. She came back 14 minutes later and I caught her attention (still no menu), but we had looked online at the menu and gave her our order that way.. And asked for water.. She took my card to start a tab and my food arrived in 20 minutes. I was shocked! But then again, our actual waitress hadn't dropped off the food.. So we had nothing to drink still.. Another 8 minutes passed and I'm almost done with my meal when she walks by and I asked her for the water we ordered.. Ugh!! It wouldn't have been SOOO annoying if she was running around dropping drinks here and there and just busy. The problem was that she said she was busy, but came back to take drink orders while never having anything we asked from her. Why are you taking MORE orders when you cannot even the deliver on the simple requests?! You don't need a bartender to hand you a menu.. Anyway, oops off topic.. When I asked her to run my card and end this terrible night, she came back with my receipt and no card. I asked where my card was and she said she already gave it back to me.. Noooooo.. She said "I always return them once I swipe them and I gave it back to you" I replied with "How could you have given it back to me when I haven't even SEEN you all night?!?" She went to look for it and would you have guessed she had it and asked me if I was Connie or Jamie.. I should have taken the other persons card and went to the manager to complain that they just hand your card back to strangers.. But alas, I was tired and annoyed and after that I couldn't even give her a pity tip.. DONE!!!  In short (haha), this could be a BADASS place, but the service is SOOO shitty you had better show up already drunk in order to not care that you're being treated like shit..  Also, when I checked in and made a comment about service, all of my friends also had a personal horror story.. So sad.. Such a waste of a cool idea!!!

This place is super close by our house so we decided to try it out for our new breakfast plate. I ordered the garden omelette which came with hash browns and an English muffin. The hash browns appeared to be cooked thoroughly but were very mushy on the inside. The omelette itself tasted like nothing.. Literally.. Nothing. The veggies (especially the spinach) were bland. I honestly told my fiancé I couldn't even taste what I was eating. The English muffin was cold and I don't think actually toasted. We were handed the wrong bill ($11 more) and when we said it wasn't ours the other waitress said "happens all the time".. Ummmmm.. My fiancé had corned beef and hash. I thought it tasted like dog food but he said it was mediocre. All in all, of I do ever come back, out of convenience only, I definitely wont be eating hash browns again. Although, it's hardly worth the $20 when you hated your meal..

... We really liked Dickey's when it was at Norterra and were sad they closed down and even more worried to try this location after seeing the reviews for this location..  First, to the guy who complained the portions were small and didn't fill you up, you sir, ruined my dining experience because instead of ordering the Little Hoagie and two sides, I opted for the Big BBQ sandwich with Mac N Cheese and Waffle Fries.. Now I'm so stuffed I can barely shove down a FREE ice cream cone! Listen here, I am an EATER.. I can eat a 300 pound man under the table (not literally of course, but you know).. So the fact that I left uncomfortably full should mean something to anyone who knows me..   At any rate, I even was worried about ordering and noted the time I placed my order.. Except that as I was paying 30 seconds later, food was ready.. Saturday night at 6:15 pm.. Maybe some people caught them on an off night because we didn't have any of those problems!   My husband ordered the 2 meat plate with spicy sausage and pulled pork. I don't like sausage (insert sarcastic comment here), so I can't give a review for it.. But he enjoyed the food, too, and really liked the baked potato casserole! He thinks it's a little pricey, but that's BBQ places for you.. Plus, I would pay a little more for no fatty meat.  We will be back.. Thank you!

I don't even know where to start.. Dude asks what I need.. I need an oil change.. Seems simple enough right?? So, he says "wanna get the XYZ wash with that for $21?"  I'm thinking, what a great deal for an oil change because I know it comes with a FREE carwash.. So I'm like "sure..".. He walks away and sends another guy over to chat about oil changes and what I need.. $72.. Wait.. What was $21? In the interim, first dude tucks a ticket under my windshield wiper and tucks the other on my front dash where I couldn't reach it (7 months pregnant here).. I reach hard for the ticket and see that it says $56.. I ask what I'm signing.. What is all this.. Second dude says $72 for oil change and XYZ wash upgrade ($56).. I told him I didn't want my car washed them and to "please just change my oil only".. He says it comes with a free basic wash. I said whatever, just give me the oil change.. He grabs the ticket from me and hands it back to the first guy where I have asked for JUST AN OIL CHANGE several times now.. To now here is me swearing and about to cry "I JUST WANT MY FUCKING OIL CHANGED".. "What can I do for you ma'am" says the first dude.. Okay, I'm out of here.. I put my car in reverse and sped the hell out of there while three men stood there like idiots acting like I'm the bitch because they kept up-selling me and I wouldn't have it.. When it was Danny's, they fucked up my shit at the 7th avenue location.. Changing their name and management has only made them worse.. And now I'm glad they didn't touch my car!
