Yummy Margarita, interesting fried calamari, and fabulous blackened fish tacos!  We decided we wanted Mexican Thursday night and found out within a walking distance of the Convention center you have about 3 choices for dinner. The one closest was indicated as herendous, so we immediately skipped it. One of the "ambassadors" suggested this place and said the carnitas were fabulous.  We arrived right about 6pm and had no trouble getting seated outside. Our waitress was really friendly and happy. I started with a house margarita (rocks, salt of course) and it came in a shaker that help pretty much the equivalent of 2!!  Hence the limit to 2 to a person!  Very tasty! I didn't think it was very strong till i got up and started to walk around!  The chips and salsa were interesting. There were 2 different type of chips - some puffy with a bit of sweetness, some regular. Definitely tasty. And the salsa was good!  We started with corn encrusted calamari - very interesting and yummy! I did the blackened fish tacos, hubby went with the steak and blue cheese quesadilla. The fish was amazing! Make sure you get extra salsa! The quesadilla was weird - not something we would get again.

It is what it is - a dated hotel, in the middle of the strip with nothing around.  The draw is the big old saucer sitting at the top. Yup! I was here for the Stair Climb that takes place inside one of the struts and supports the American Lung Association.  I booked on line and it was extremely cheap and affordable. What was a bummer, was that the "deal" price that American Lung Assoc got, was more than the on line price. Boo.  I did not choose to upgrade my room to have a re-ferbed room and to have a view. There is a whole saucer up there to enjoy the view from, duh. And i was really only coming in to do the race and head back home. So i did not upgrade. My room was directly in front of the elevators. ugh. There was a limited power plugs, furnishings were dated, but i'm assuming once the full refurb gets done this will be updated.  We were in a handicapped accessible room, which is fine, but there was no place in the bathroom to put your stuff. Barely room to stick your tooth brush. And the towels were across the room. I pity the handicapped person attempting to dry off after their shower or bath.  Elevators were pretty speedy. Shops were ok. Restaurant on site had a great menu, we enjoyed some wonderful appetizers.   I'm not a gambler, but the casino seemed small and meh. The smoke smell wasn't too terrible, but certainly noticeable since i was there to do a race for American Lung Association.  Note: there is a starbucks on site and they do a pretty good job!  All in all - it's the stratosphere...  take it for what it is. You get what you get!

Definitely a swanky hotel! I've luckily been able to get good deals each time i've gone there!   The room are huge - but always seem like a waste, cause you are never there long enough to enjoy it to the max!  Free internet in the rooms now - score!  A room facing in will have limited cell signal due to all the concrete, cinder block, this time we faced the pools and strip!  And hello - remote control blinds - how frikin fun is that!  Elevators move pretty quick, which is nice.  No easy way to get from parking to your room, but they don't want you to leave, so that's ok!

It is what it is - cheesecake factory with a different front!  I've eaten at this one in the Venetian more times than I'm proud to admit!  It's huge, but generally there is a line - unless you eat at midnight! Bar is usually a good bet and the portions are huge!  Staff is usually pretty friendly and helpful.

OMG - eggs Benedict special was amazing! I usually try to eat somewhat well, sauce on the side, eat half, cancer causing sweetener. All that went out the window when i walked in there this morning. Luckily there was a short wait and it was a great day out! Put your name on the list by the door. Don't come into the restaurant unless you know you should - it's too small!!  The staff is amazingly friendly and down to earth! We were seated promptly when called, got coffee and oj (order the double oj, small is really just a taste!)  Hubby did the Hog and Chix - mmmm! Bacon looked amazing. Bread is thick cut and comes with fabulous strawberry rhubarb jelly. Mmmm! I did the Benedict and it was amazing - did i mention it was amazing? The sauce, oh the sauce. The ham The home made english muffin - smothered in butter...  yes my arteries are clogging as i write this...  but wow! The home fries with the caramelized onions. The coffee with the organic raw sugar.  Amazing!  Cute little location. Limited parking - but we walked so it didn't effect us much. Short menu, but super yummy!

Ah in-n-out. Now that we live in Denver, when we have the opportunity to get some animal style burgers we do it.    This little place is more of a local location - since it is off the strip and across the highway!  It's a normal in-n-out, staff is friendly, no so hidden menu is available and food is great!  The fries i can't say i've ever been a fan, but they were hot and fried!   A good amount of outside seating and which delivery of the food!

We popped up here for a drink, the view was amazing, staff was pleasant. Price is obviously high - but you are paying for the view. Their choices of wine is limited. Their choice of appetizers is slim and not appetizing. Which was a bummer! Hopefully they can expand the options! We would have spent a bit of time and money there, but alas we simply enjoyed our wine and the view and left. Luckily they didn't care too much about dress code - we were allowed access in shorts! Great place for a date or romantic evening! Note: Elevator is open glass. And elevator will only go to that floor when the restaurant is open, and it doesn't open at 4pm! Check the signs. only certain elevators go up to the top!

It is in the Wyndham and therfore when there is a conference you can end up in a long line - so plan accordingly. The staff is extremely friendly - they like to know where the people flowing through are from and that can be fun!  My drink was as expected!  Another feature is the "musical preacher" spends his time when he is not preaching or singing in the corner table!

Onions rings tasty - service bad I should have listened to all the rest of the reviews. But we were hungry, at the convention center and not wanting to walk to far. We also wanted to eat outside.  Our server was terrible. He offered not options when we asked what was on tap and if they had any wheat beers. He said they didn't have any and didn't offer up the drink menu. Sigh.  We started with the "spicy" onion rings. Basically onions rings sprinkled with season sauce. Tasty none the less, although not spicy! I did a chicken sandwich - they did not cut the tendon out, so chomping into that sucked. The coleslaw was ok. Hubby wanted the Cajun sausage sandwich and said - the Cajun sausage. Also said no veggies. The waiter assumed he wanted the main pasta dish...  which was awful. Tasteless Alfredo sauce. Our companion for the meal got the crab cake sandwich, he didn't want the wheat bun and his only other options was sour dough bread. The crab was not tasty.  The front patio is a great location to hang out, but just don't go with great expectations. And grab a drink menu on the way in!

Awesome customizable breakfast burrito I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and attempted to visit Baja Fresh 3 doors down, but alas this branch is not open for breakfast. Lucky for us it was not! We walked down the block looking for something to fill our bellies and this place called me in! The ladies behind the counter are amazingly friendly, helpful, and wonderful at their craft! The burrito options are wide open! Pick what you want in there, and they do it! I got carnitas, beans, cheese, and bacon and included the potatoes inside! So super yummy! And the red spicy sauce was great! ask for 2!  Wish i lived closer so i could try more of the options for lunch!!

We popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square. The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. Note: if you just want a brew - you can order it inside! We went with a local Hefe and it was great! The options for noshing look great, but we were headed for dinner so we didn't get a chance to try them out! See you there soon!

Pleasant staff, typical yumminess!  Cookie don't you want some with sinless sweet cream I was not as offended by the staff as others, but we also went close to 8pm on a week night. I was more offended by the stupid people in the store!  I always get the same thing! Cookie don't you want some. And i substitute the sinless for the regular. With all that goodness inside, you can't tell the difference! I also go with the love it size - they fill it up really nicely!

Hidden in the Bonanza Casino - just go in the door and head to the center and there it is!   It's a dunkin donuts, it in vegas and since there is such high turn over of the product, they are quite tasty!  I might be overly excited since Colorado only had 3 dunkin donuts and they are 1.5 hours from Denver, so when i get to have my fat laden balls of heaven, i'm tickled pink!  I got the chocolate munchkins - only 3 this time - and just as fresh and glazy as they should be! Mmmm

I read rave reviews about this place and it was 2 blocks from my hotel, so i had to check it out! The NY accent is definitely thick and abounds in there! The menu is huge! The specials are indeed all over the place!  I went with the turkey special and spaced when ordering it and got a wrap... Not that yummy bread that everyone speaks so highly of. I couldn't believe it as it existed my mouth... sigh. It was made fresh right in front of me, and i even had a choice for the wrap - wheat, spinach, tomato or something else... woah!  There are cute tables out front, unfortunately a family of about 15 small children bogarted it for the entire time i was there. The light rail passes by and luckily is not very loud.  I would definitely be here frequently if i lived here, but alas, i am just passing through! If you are attending a conference walk the 4 blocks down Adams, skip quiznos and subway and enjoy a great sandwich!  And try the meatball sub - it looked amazing!

Tried this little gem this evening! Cute little location, cozy tables, and bar seating! Note: carpet by side door does not indicate the front door! The front door faces 1st street!  We got a table in the back, i sat on the cushy bench seat. Our waiter Christian was very helpful, attentive and friendly. We tried the Japanese Heffewiesin - who knew they made one? And it was tasty! (This location has no citrus besides lime, so keep that in mind if you want something in your beer or water)  For our food choices we went with: spicy wontons - great flavor and like other mentioned could use more filling - but definitely worth eating sesame tofu - great light batter, good sauces lime mint beef - not something i would do again - not bad, but not carpaccio shrimp wrapped in bacon - how could that not be good? And a spicy sauce beach mushroom wrapped in bacon - again- how could it not be good? wasabi soy chicken breast - amazingly moist, great sauces.  Definitely a fun location, tons of yummy choices, attentive staff! I want to try the grilled rice ball and pretty much the rest of the menu!!! Wish I lived closer!

Go before the sun starts to set, so you can get a good set!  As others say - you can see the dinning room spin below you! Depending where you sit, you can see straight down the strip and see the lights turn on!  Staff is really friendly and helpful, i was doing the stair climb the next day - so i said - this is crazy but can i have a shirly temple - the bartender didn't blink an eye and said sure thing! He even offered up the 2 for 1 deal for me! Too cute!   The view, even from behind the bar, was nice!!  Definitely stop in, enjoy a beverage and the view!

Pros: cute, adorable outdoor location, fun for people watching (there is also an indoor bar, but i didn't make it there) Cons: 2 drink minimum and slow service  We just needed a place to relax on a saturday late morning! There were very comfortable couches, tables and a great mai thai!  It has a nice bit of shade on those sunny hot days, staff is very nice even if they are slow!  Definitely a nice location when it's not too crowded!

lots of plugs, cool desk, expensive and bad valet, broken machines in the gym, Starbucks on site.  I stayed here for a conference.  Should have known it would be bad when we arrived and it took forever for the valet to notice us in line and offer to deal with our bags. Every other time we attempted to get our car they were ovelry slow - they would quote 10 minutes and the car would take 20 to get to us. Their automated system was awful and they never knew it had been activated. Dropping off the car was worse. The driveway was only 1 car wide, and they allowed one of their friends of employees to park at the front end, messing up the flow. They would bring up as well as take away the cars from the same place, so you were stuck in line no matter what. It was just terrible and for $23 a day I expected much much much better service. I would have parked at the lot across the street had i know the cost. The front desk was amazingly slow. Way too slow for a pre-reserved room. They sent us up to a room that was supposed to be blocked off and not get rented out. Luckily it was just one guy attempting to hang a picture. He offered to do it later and we were able to get into our room. The room had a really great giant desk with tons of plugs, and the night stand had a couple plugs too. The bed had cute lights for reading. The bummer was no fridge. So our snacks and lunch meat were a loss. The TV was huge. The elevators ran well (more than i can say for the hyatt) There is a starbucks on site - woohoo! The on site bar is cute and open late The beds are comfy, pillows too squishy for me (but that is most places) Rooms are clean and cleaned quickly. If you get a room with a connector door, make sure you know the people on the other side. There was a party one night and we could hear most of it. The gym was ok. Lots of people partook - which made the fact that 2 of the 3 ellipticals were broken, even more painful. There were 2 treadmills and 3 bikes. And a full weight machine. A dry sauna and full supply of towels. Can't say for sure if i would stay here again - hyatt seemed worse and these are the 2 closest hotels to the convention center.
