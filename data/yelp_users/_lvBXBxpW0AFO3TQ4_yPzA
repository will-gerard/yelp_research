Walked in today to buy a Century Link Router; they had two. One the routers were 3 different prices (a $50 and $75 sticker prices on the boxes for the exact same router with the same accessories) (they also had a craigslist ad listing the router at $60, despite the fact that a $50 sticker was visable in the ad) for the two same routers. So I asked for the $50 price, which was displayed in the craigslist ad picture and the sticker price of the router. I was told that it was for sale $60 and they wouldn't go down to the $50. Here's the ad, http://phoenix.craigslist.org/nph/eld/3130745784.html they have recently cropped the photo to remove the visable $50 price sticker. This is a bad way to do business and I won't be back there.

I have been going to North Mountain for over a year now! I have found Heroes 19 there (the beer to honor the Yarnell Firefighters), and tons of other delicious beers. Current favorite is the Serendipitous! I do wish they would bring back the Bearded Dragon and the Imaginary IPA.  The bartenders and servers have never been anything but the friendliest, and even if I go by myself I always find myself caught up in a nice conversation.   Oh yeah, they have some of the best wings I have ever had! Without hyperbole!  I wish them nothing but the best!
