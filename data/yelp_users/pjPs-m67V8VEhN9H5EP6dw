Authentic Cantonese style food. Pork belly was crunchy. Hot and sour soup was on point. Bbq pork and duck were very good.

Horrible experience with this target. Managers are not helpful and willing to work to provide outstanding customer service to their customers. I will be calling corporate to report this store and most especially the manager on duty during my numerous encounters at this location.

My go to. They may only have two people but they are good and very personable. Some ppl may not like the fact that when they are busy they get turned away but when you actually stay you leave happy.

Went here to do my nails last minute. Figured I'd give it a try since it is extremely close to home compared to my regular nail place. Big mistake! The most half ass nail job I have ever had. I went home and had to reshape and file them down myself. I would never recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy. Spare yourself avoid this nail shop.

The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.

Horrible. Came to get my front brakes changed they told me I needed to replace my rear brakes and rotors due to a crack in the rotor.  Not the case. Rear brakes and rotors were fine after I had taken my car to nissan to have them checked out after talking with mechanics from big o. Mind you I had my rear brakes changed in April at nissan so from my knowledge they were fine. Now my front brakes are squeaking worse then the day I brought them in. Brought them back to big O they're telling me they'll replace my brakes for free but now I have to replace my rotors for $99.95ea. Needless to say they are just taking advantage of people. Problem never got solved. Avoid them at all cost.

By far the best Vietnamese food I've had. Most authentic. They don't serve pho so don't come here looking for it.

Only location I know that won't let you customize your bundtlets unless you call ahead. Employee flat out said no when I asked if I could substitute chocolate for more red velvet.
