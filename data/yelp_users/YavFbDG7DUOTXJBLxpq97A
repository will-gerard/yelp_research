LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  Excellent food, superior iced tea and a fabulous environment.  The only problem .... is the parking. It is next to impossible! Usually I just valet but sometimes I am lucky to find a spot (depending on what time of day and what day of the week it is!)  I highly recommend the Cubano sandwich, the Padre pizza and their iced tea (w/ an orange and one Equal, mmm, it's delish.)  And if you have to wait in line for 10-15 mins, trust me.. it's worth it!

One of the last surviving local boutiques left in the Valley!   I've gotten some cool t-shirts here and a couple accessories. One of the t-shirts was even by a local designer, which is great. Only bummer is that being a small store, they are limited on sizes. It's understandable though. Props to them for surviving the economy and staying true to what they are!  I've only met one of the two owners, the guy (his name is escaping me), and he was super nice. We had a brief little conversation about retail in Scottsdale.   I'd say if you're in the area, definitely check out this store for some cool finds!

Great salon.   Laid-back atmosphere...great prices...not prententious.   Highly recommended.  Been going to Denise (the owner & hair veteran herself) for over 10 years. I don't trust anyone else with my hair & for good reason; she does amazing work!

Alright, so you can get coffee anywhere, right? Then let's talk about everything else....  You really can't beat the friendly baristas and great customer service at this location.  I've been a regular here for a few years now and for good reason! Besides it's convienient location, they are SUPER fast when making drinks and if there's a line it moves pretty quickly. And the staff, I cannot say enough good things about them! They are all super nice and always have a smile on my face.   Be warned though, it does get very busy here in the morning so make sure to allow yourself enough time if you are heading to work.  They've got a great patio too that expands around the whole building!  Sometimes, too, they'll be able to tell if I want an extra espresso shot in my drink even before I've said so. Haha!

Hands down the best department store.  They are the epitome of true customer service. I always have a pleasant experience whenever I shop there, even if I don't purchase anything.  Alan, who helps me out in my section (The Rail), is just fantastic. Knows exactly what I likes and will call me whenever new stuff comes in.  And their sales are ALWAYS fabulous.

Soooooooo yummy! This place has been here forever and for VERY good reason.   Top-notch service, authentic Thai cuisine, and a great location. It really doesn't get much better. The atmosphere is also very nice. You can sit in the main dining room, a more quiet room or the bar. Whichever you prefer.   I highly recommend the Pad Thai if you are new to Thai food. If you are looking for something more exciting, try the Tom Ka Gai soup, Crispy Basil Chicken or Coco Chili Fish.  And for the record, ask for your server to be Cassie. She's been there a while and knows the menu like the back of her hand. Fabulous service.  The bar makes a pretty mean cocktail, too. And you can order take-out! Thai on the Fly!

I've been a diehard Pei Wei addict for about 5 years now. I pretty much get the same thing every time - 2 Spring Rolls and a Pad Thai with Chicken. And despite other reviews, the pricing is TOTALLY reasonable as a Pad Thai with chicken can easily feed two people.   And speaking of the Pad Thai.. this is hands down the best one I think I've ever had. And I've tried quite a few all over the Valley. This location is great although my favorite (and less busy) is the one located a few miles north of this one in The Summit shopping plaza.  In fact, I think I'll be getting it for lunch today!

I used to be an avid shopper/seller at Buffalo Exchange. As I work at a boutique, it was nice that I could bring in brand-name merchandise and get cash for it when I needed it. The majority of the staff knew me and were always very friendly. I don't know if it's new managment or new policies but things have definitely changed around there. After yesterday's experience, I will definitely be taking my clothing somewhere else. First of all, the service took way too long. Secondly, the "buyer trainee" was unsure on about every single item I had brought in and priced a couple like-new $120-130 tshirts at about $20. The attitude of the staff is quite off-putting and it kind of makes it seem like it's such a task. However, they red-haired girl who was working by the fitting rooms was very friendly & helpful. I don't mean to sound like a hater, but as I was quite a loyal customer it was  quite a disappointment, especially in this economic crisis where customer service has never been more important than for those who work in retail.

Fez is just FREAKIN' fabulous!  With it's modern decor, low lighting, hip music and intimate setting in central Phoenix, it's the perfect little getaway restaurant.   And the food.....TO DIE FOR! Where shall I start? The cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries will melt in your mouth. I highly recommend them and any of the kisra plates. The Casablanca chicken sandwich is also delish.  The service is also very friendly and attentive...very refreshing!They also have a nice little patio in the back which is nice if you're a smoker, considering it's banned so many different places now!  And even if you aren't in the mood for dinner, it's got a great bar area to sip a cocktail or two.

It does not get much better than this, fellas.  BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.  Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.  Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday.   Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.  It definitely has a "Cheers" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.  Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007.

A great place to grab a tasty bite if you aren't feeling the food court at Fashion Square.  Delish plates! My personal favorite is the Chicken & Broccoli pasta. Simply divine.  They also have a small wine & beer selection in case you're looking to have a drink.  Love it!

Look, I only know this place as the "drunk food" destination in Old Town. But mmmmmmm, it is SOOOOO good! I've only gotten a couple items off the menu and my personal favorite is the Passyunk Ave. It's a lovely Italian combo of mozzarella, roasted red peppers and Balsamic vinegar.   They're pretty fast, even when they're slammed during their busiest hours (from 1am-3am)   If you are starved and in Old Town, definitely check this place out. Granted, if you are not already intoxicated, you better be prepared to deal with intoxicated people!   It's open 24 hrs and make sure to donate a dollar to add to the ceiling or wall. The clerks and cooks work pretty hard.  I found mine last time I was there. ;)

Fabulous little Italian joint with a couple other Valley locations. I went here for a friend's birthday, had some drinks, bruschetta and the Chicken Parmesan. The bruschetta was fabulous - the bread was toasty and there were just the right amount of tomatoes. The Chicken Parmesan was mouth-watering. I am a big fan of this dish in general and Nick's did not disappoint!  An overall great atmosphere, good portions and a friendly staff will definitely bring me back to Nick's again. Highly recommended!

Best place in the food court, hands down.  Great service, superior food and AM-A-ZING cookies!  (It's true..they really are.)  Being that I work in the mall, it's my go-to spot for a Diet Coke or a little 3pm pick-me-up. Free refills too, which is a nice little perk.   They've always got a line (especially Fri-Sun), so make sure you know what to order by the time you get to the register.   I highly recommend the Tomato Basil pasta salad, the black & white Chippers, the Chicken Walnut salad and the peach decaf iced tea!  The manager, Jessie, is also a doll. Very nice.

I must say, I was pretty impressed by Scottsdale Jean Company when they first opened up a few years ago. I bought a pair of William Rast jeans and a couple tshirts but really hadn't gone in there until recently.   Well, I must say I was pretty disappointed. With a lackluster selection of sizes and feeling like I was being stalked by the overeager salespeople, it was a not a very pleasant experience. And coming from a retail background myself, it's common sense that you you must never give the customer the impression that you are working under commission or just to make the sale, etc. Big no-no and a big turnoff.   I will give them points on carrying a great variety of brands though.. Christian Audigier, True Religion, Union... and for the ladies .. Hale Bob, Frankie B, Ankh....  (And for the record, you can also find all of these brands at  Valley stalwart Electric Ladyland.)

Went there for happy hour one time and have not been back since.   Pretty medicore service. When it FINALLY arrived, some of our food was cold. Our server seemed like she had MUCH better things to do...god forbid I ask for a refill! Speaking of drinks, they were a bit overpriced considering how weak they were..although, maybe I'm a bit biased there.  I mean, they had just opened 2 months before but still....cold miso soup? Yuck.  Attitude? Yuck.  If you want a great sushi place, try Sapporo or Sushi Brokers.

Grabbed a coffee here today with a couple friends. Had an "Iced Toddy", which is their iced coffee. It was fabulous!   Cool atmosphere. I loved the decor and local art. Will definitely stop by next time I am in Tempe and have a craving for some coffee. :)

I rarely use this Circle K for getting gas (I use the Safeway station up at Ashler Hills & Scottsdale Rd - cheapppp!)   However, I always am greeted by a friendly smile and great service whenever I stop in to grab a Red Bull or a pack of a cigarettes. Usually they already know what kind I want...which is nice.

Prefer this place over other "clothing exchanges" in the area.   Friendly staff...store is usually pretty quiet when I go in which is nice as I cannot stand crowds! Mens selection is a little skimpy .. however when I go there it's usually just to sell. On that note, they pay you 5% more of the retail value of any of your clothing than Buffalo does!   And, it's always nice to be able to support local businesses!

I love this place. It's great for a quick meal if you're shopping or if you work in the area and are on lunch break.   I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Turkey salad. I get it a couple times a week and with very good reason:  Perfectly portioned and well-priced, it's filled with chopped turkey, Vermont Cheddar, hard-boiled eggs, crispy lettuce, cherry tomatoes and corn. I prefer it with the Cowboy Ranch dressing, but there's also a vinaigrette option. All that for just under $6!  I've gotten the sliders a couple times - they are delish and sized just right for what they are. I know if I am craving a big juicy burger, I can go hit up Johnny Rocket's in the mall, or better yet Five Guys when it opens!  This was a great concept and it's very nice that it's not trying to be something it's not. Take-out is obviously what the aim is here, as seating is limited.

Fantastic customer service, particularly by Leslie.  As I work in the mall, it's nice that I can pop over to the store on a break if I need a new phone or am having any technical issues. They are fast & extremely helpful.  Highly recommended!

Went here with a mad hangover with a few friends earlier today. Let me just say, the food certainly hit the spot. I'd been told by some to order anything with carne asada. Boy, am I glad I did!  I got the Carne Asada quesadilla (XL, as the regular is just an 8 in tortilla folded in half). It was delicious. Caramelized onions, lettuce, tender carne asada .... it melted in my mouth.   Also had some yummy chips and salsa. The patio seating was nice and the shade was an added bonus. I'll definitely check out this place next time in Tempe. :)

Beautiful store and great visuals. I have not purchased anything at this location...yet. Compared to the mens' section at the Scottsdale Quarter, this one is substantially larger. They have a pretty nice selection of dress shirts and pants. I just wish I wasn't in between sizes so often here. I generally find that the "L.O.G.G." (Label of Graded Goods) pieces fit me the best.   Really great womens' selection upstairs that has definitely given Forever 21 a run for it's money.   This is obviously a great place to find trendy, of-the-moment pieces for fabulous prices. Check it out!
