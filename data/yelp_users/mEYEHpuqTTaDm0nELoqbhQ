The Gate Attendant was incredibly rude and disrespectful to us if front of other customers (and, this was after we volunteered to give up our window seat because she needed someone to sit in the exit isle.)  No perks, no thank you, simply a shrew of an employee having a bad day and then taking it out on a customer.   Let's put it this way, she was so rude that all three (3) flight attendants who overheard her, apologized to me later during the flight.  One even offered to buy me a drink.  While I appreciate their efforts, I'm horrified that a US Airways Gate Attendant has no customer service training and is allowed to strut around like the monarch shouting "Off with their heads."  The incident gave us a very poor image of US Airways.  Next time we'll book with another airline.

Great service, Great beers & Great experience!  Beers - 5 Service - 5+++ Atmosphere - 5 Food - 4  We brought our group of 18 into Four Peaks early on a Sunday night for my wife's birthday.  The place is really cool, but was totally PACKED inside and out.  Yet, all the staff were SUPER helpful in getting us a table, beers, and food.  They were also VERY knowledgeable about the beers.  And, all the servers in our section pitched-in to make sure that everything went as smooth as possible for our large group.  The Hop Knot IPA was the big hit with our crowd.  We ordered quite a few pints and pitchers.  I also thought the Baltic Porter was an awesome Winter Seasonal and the 8th Street Pale was super easy drinking.    As a beer geek & beer judge, gotta say that the brewers at Four Peaks  have it down for taste and drinkability.  Normally, I'm not a filtered beer fan for pub drinking (just don't see the need & you can get some thin, flavorless beers.)  But, they know how to craft a proper filtered pint here, which for me, is saying a lot.  Everyone thought the food was good and much better than most pub fare (some did comment that the cheese pizza and fish & chips were a bit too greasy.)  But, everyone enjoyed themselves and we had a great birthday party.  We would definitely go back and recommend Four Peaks to our friends.  Thanks Four Peaks!

NOTE:  We did not overnight at the Rio, but spent the evening in the casino and had dinner.  Overall, the Rio was just OK (2.5 - 3 stars depending on location.)  Our experience: Bar Areas - 2 stars * The Irish Pub At The Rio - shuttered closed (none of the staff were aware of this!) * IBAR - loud and obnoxious music and too many videos. * VooDoo Rooftop Nightclub - should have gone here, but it was too early. * Masquerade Bar - It was the best of the rest, but seating was limited and table service was non-existent.  So, we opted to get a frozen drink from a stand by the entrance and check out the place.  Village All Seafood Buffet - 2 stars It has many rave reviews, but it smelled fishy and was $48/person.  We opted for the main buffet.  Carnival World Buffet:   Food - 4 stars There were many food choices from the very basic to the fairly stylish.  The quality was higher than other buffets I've seen.  And, the food was mostly tasty.  Experience - 2 stars For $39/person, it should have been a much better experience.  The wait was ridiculously long.  The seating and "service" were totally absurd.  It was like eating at noisy & crowded food court in a shopping mall.  The host sent us a to table with only 3 seats,  yet there were 4 of us.   I had to walk around the restaurant pleading for an extra seat from other customers.  Given that The Rio an older property, you'd think they'd have gotten it together by now.   We won't be returning anytime soon.

Firefly was very good and some dishes were great.   A fun dining experience off the Strip.   Ambiance - 4 stars Hipster.  But, very noisy and ice-cold AC inside.  So, we opted to sit outside, which was fine at 10pm   Service - 3 stars The server was very timely initially, but then they seemed to forget about us as the meal progressed.  Drinks - 2 stars The Mojito & Margaritas were far too sweet and took forever to arrive.  Food -  Menu Variety - 5 stars Amazing choices (perhaps too many!)  ;-)  Stuffed dates - 5 stars "Dance Party" in your mouth with bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  Amazing!  Ham & Cheese Croquetas - 3 stars While good (and recommended by the server), it was just too rich & creamy to fully appreciate the Serrano Ham & Manchego Cheese  Steak & Mushroom Skewers - 4 stars Grilled filet, roast garlic cream & red wine reduction.  There was quite a lot of meat, which was tender & tasty.  The sauce, while good, was a bit bland.  Beet Salad - 3 stars It had all the proper components, beets, tender greens, nuts & feta cheese.  But, it was also somewhat bland.  Overall, Firefly was good and we might try it again with another group of friends.

The food was pretty darn good.  But, the general lack of decor, which allowed for wild echos as well as the stark lighting, detracted from the experience.  That, coupled with the odd location in empty strip mall is kinda weird.  Maybe 3.5 stars overall.  But, we did like the food:  The food - 4.0 stars Overall - very good!  But, all of is was fairly cold.  If hotter, it would have tasted better.  Red Lentils - 4.5 stars Slightly underdone, but great spicy flavor.  Yellow Lentils - 4 stars A great change of taste vs the red, with a very unique tangy flavor.  Cabbage - 4 stars Fresh and tangy.  Green Beans - 4.0 stars Delicious.  Never had that served at Ethiopian restaurant before.  Salad - 3 stars Pretty plain, but it was refreshing.  Injera Bread - 4 stars More whole wheat-like (or Teff) in both color and texture.  Quite good.  The thicker version used on the tray was quite sour, almost too much.   PS - also, be prepared for a leisurely meal.  They don't do a lot of rushing here.

Outstanding meal !   We read a lot of reviews and asked a lot of locals about steakhouses and Gallagher's kept getting consistent reviews.  Our table ordered the Fillet Mignon, Seared Ahi Tuna & Lobster Tails.  All were cooked to perfection and simply melted in your mouth.  Delicious!    Really wanted to try to their aged beef, which is on display, but it was just too much for us that night.  Wish we had more people in our party.  That way we could have tried more of the steaks!  The service was top-notch too.  We would definitely go back.

OMG!!! * Terrific service * Excellent food * A great birthday experience!   It definitely lived up to all the rave reviews.  We would recommend Roy's highly.  Greeting - 5 stars  The hosts acknowledged my birthday immediately and they provided several menu selections, including vegetarian and gluten-free.  Service - 5 stars (and this is from very picky people) The server told us he was going to help make it a perfect meal, and he did!  Both he and busser made sure everything was right, repeatedly.  Even took a photo, which arrived later with a frame.  Food - 5 stars + (see detail below:)  Auntie Lei's Aloha Roll (Spicy Tuna Roll) - 5.7 stars Extremely fresh & tasty.  We were forewarned by our server that is was spicy... and it was, with an incredible burn (maybe too much for others, but we loved it.) The roll was great and SO flavorful; wasabi horseradish and ginger were not required!  Rock Shrimp & Peaches - 5.9 stars A surprisingly awesome combination!  Not only exceeded our expectations, but also we would order again in heartbeat.  The shrimp was perfect, the peaches picked at the peak of ripeness.  Ahi Poke - 5.2 stars Super fresh Ahi that melted in your mouth.  A bit heavy on the sesame oil, which we only noticed because the Rock Shrimp was so light and refreshing.  Porcini Dusted Hangar Steak - 5.3 stars with Creamed Collards, Crispy Onion Rings, Asian A-1 Prepared like a long tenderloin, with perfect searing.  The meat was a touch more rare than medium rare, but it tasted great.  Their Asian A-1 was good too.  The collards, although rich, went with the steak quite well.  The onions rings... TO DIE FOR!  Butterfish - 5.9 stars How do they do it!?!   We've cooked ourselves at home and ordered Butterfish before out and this was "Out of this World" experience.  An amazing charred-caramelized searing with a perfect tender texture inside.  The Sous Chef came out later to speak with us (a very nice touch) and talked about how he charred, and then baked it.  Chocolate Soufflé - 5.0 stars The texture of the Soufflé was very good and the molten chocolate oozed out of the middle across the plate just like you'd imagine.  But, while uber-chocolaty and decadent, it was a bit too sweet.    But, it was a GREAT experience & meal.  We would come back in a heartbeat.  Thanks Roy's!

For AYCE sushi, this place is tops!  Been here twice.  Both time OUTSTANDING!  We sat at the bar and the service was super fast.  Often I've seen AYCE where they make you wait and try to load you up on soups & appetizers.  While you can certainly get those, their many sushi chefs whip out some amazing creations super fast.  You can get basic Nigiri, which was fine.  Actually, the salmon was quite good.  And, they have an amazing selection of rolls too.  But, my favorite was the "seafood salad" which is huge plate of various Sashimi (no rice) with a ponzu-like sauce.  OMG!  Wished we lived closer!

GREAT Burgers, Beer Selection & Service!    We'd been searching around Vegas (mostly in vain) for some good craft beer choices.  Well, Burger Bar's got some of THE best beer taps in town!  Couple that with top-notch burgers and you've got a great combo!  (FYI - we are in the restaurant biz ourselves and are super picky too.)  I ordered the Grass-Fed Burger with two kinds of crushed peppercorns and peppercorn sauce on the side.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and VERY tasty.   My wife opted for sprouts & avocado on hers.    (BTW - The burgers are half pounders, which is usually too big for us.  But, they were SO good, we both ate every bite!)  We visited Burger Bar for our last meal in Vegas.  Bad luck...  We should have gone there first.  That way, we could have come back again!   Definitely recommended for beer & burgers.  PS - With all the burger choices, wish they offered either an accurate online or take-out menu that we could share with friends.

Another great experience...  Burgers, Beers & Service.  Sat at the bar again, which was good since the cook was asleep at the wheel and NOT reading his tickets properly.  I think all of us had something missing from our burgers.  The waitress was very nice about it and was quick to correct the problem... more than once.  It still tasted awesome and they've got THE best draught beer selection in Vegas!

Note:  There are two Parasol at the Wynn (Up & Down.)  Parasol Up section is a pleasant bar in the casino.  But, don't dawdle there, the Parasol Down section (reached by escalator) is amazing!  * Very well appointed & comfortable seats * Professional service * Good drinks (but, pricey) * A gorgeous wall fountain across the the pond.  Yes, like an oasis.  Totally relaxing.  We would have stayed longer, but it was getting pretty darn hot out there by mid-morning.  That said; For an early morning Bloody Mary or late night cocktail, it was awesome!

A very well run operation.  Surprisingly good food at a GREAT value!  When we arrived, the cafeteria was TOTALLY slammed.  Heard later that is was "kid's eat free" day.   No wonder!  The line snaked all around the drink service area.  But, it kept moving along.  The wait gave us a chance to review the menu item posters, which looked good.  The Swedish meatballs & gravy were a bit heavy, but tasty.  The lingonberries on the side were awesome.  The Gravlax salmon & salad with special dill mustard was good too.  And, the soup (corn & green chili bisque) was delicious.  IMHO, the Princess Cake was too sweet, but the my family liked it more than me.    And yes, as the other Yelper stated, the carbonated LIngonberry drink was super refreshing.  And, best of all, the four of us ate & drank ourselves silly for only $18.   If your at IKEA or looking for a cheap lunch in the area, it's definitely worth the visit.

A bit torn on this review....  approx 3.5 to 4 stars Social House is a surprisingly hipster place in the Crystals Mall with high-quality stylish food and good saki.  But, service was a bit odd.  It was late in their dinner cycle when they accepted our dinner reservation.  Yet, it seemed they wanted to rush us out.  The timing seemed off as many items took far too a long to arrive while other items arrived super quickly.  Food = 4.5 stars Service = 3 stars Ambiance: * Upfront by bar = 5 stars * In the dark back of restaurant = 2.5 stars  Story... We made reservations for 9:30p.  Arrived at 9:32p.  Yet, it look a very long time to seat us and it wasn't that crowded.  We asked if we could sit at the very stylish bar, but they opted to put us all way in the far back room at hugely wide table that made conversation difficult within our group and with the server.  While the food was pricy, it was super tasty.  Everything was of very high quality, including the rice, which was perfect - flavorful and not too starchy.    Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi - 5 stars ($22) OUTSTANDING!  Amazing subtle flavors.  Would order another again in a heartbeat.  Spicy Tuna Roll - 5 stars ($13) Awesome combinations of flavors!  One of THE best we've ever had.  Hamachi Yellowtail NIGIRI - 4 stars ($12) Very good.  Super tender, but with solid texture  Sake Salmon NIGIRI - 4 stars ($12) Creamy texture with good salmon flavor  Salmon Mango Roll- 5  stars ($22) WOW!  Wonderful flavors and textures with a sweetness almost akin to dessert.  We might go back, but there are many so other sushi restaurants to try here in Vegas first.

Great HUGE food - Awesome Bloody Mary - Good service.  Had the Sage Fried Chicken.  We had to laugh when it came to the table...  It was a huge stack of waffles (with bacon sticking out around the edges) & fried chicken with a long steak knife holding it all together.  It had to have been a least a foot tall. The hot maple caramel reduction was very tasty and worked surprisingly well with the crispy fried leaks.  Make sure to come hungry and plan to share!

Beyond the valets, who were quite efficient, we had a truly underwhelming experience at the St. Francis and would never return.     Hosting - 0 stars Incompetent and argumentative... They told us on the phone there was no wait and we should hurry over.  Arrived in less than 10 minutes and told it was now a 35-minute wait (even though 1/3 of the place was empty) and we better plan on getting drinks in the bar, .  We protested and they argued back that we took too long to arrive.  We showed them our cell phone and yes, it was 7 minutes since we had spoken.  They rolled their eyes and grudgingly gave us the huge bar table that was far too large for just the four of us.  Should have just walked out right then.  Seating - 0 stars Very dark with no lighting, no menu, and no server.  Waited for a while in site of the host.  Finally, went over to ask her for a couple of menus.  It was so dark, had to use our cell phones to read the menu.  After a squinting at them for a while, still no water & no server.  We're about to flee this "Bermuda Triangle" experience, but the server finally shows up and apologizes profusely that this is not normally his section.  OK - let's start again...  Unfortunately, it did not improve much.  Service - 2 stars Pleasant & helpful, but we were repeatedly forgotten.  Our shared appetizer didn't show until the main courses arrived.  Refills of water were slow and offers to refresh hour drinks didn't occur until we were nearly finished eating.  Took ages to get the bill paid now that the place (about 90 minutes later) had finally filled up.  Food - varied * Roasted Salmon "superfood" - 4 stars ($23) quinoa, avocado, soy beans, radish, sweet chile vinaigrette were a good combination of flavors.  We enjoyed that dish.  * Flatbread (which was like fluffy Boboli bread) - 2 stars ($13+ each) - Roasted vegetable version was severely lacking the vegetable toppings - Sausage version was heavy & greasy, and flatbread fell apart  * Meatballs - 1 star ($15) Three dry, overcooked & overly spicy meatballs (and I normally like spice) Had heartburn all night  ;-( Plus the garlic bread served with it was so hard, it was uneatable.     We will not return.

The concept is really cool, but the food was pretty average.  Joe's was highly recommended by friends.  We got there about 6:30pm on Monday.  The line was long, so we had a chance to review the menu and history.  When we got to the window and started ordering, they then told us they were out of most everything except burgers, grilled chicken & fries So, that's what we ordered.   There was no pizza, no BBQ, no onion rings, etc.)  Wish the would have told us while we waited.  Heck, they had fancy TV monitors promoting their products while we stood in line.  Why not tell us the update before getting to the window!?!  And, it was just OK... basic grilled chicken either on a bun or on-top of a salad.  The dressings were nothing to write home about.  The menu promised greens from their farm.  Well, sorry to say, I've grown & purchased local, farm fresh greens and Joe's tasted pretty mass-produced and bland.  My biggest concern would be that we arrived OFF season and waited at least 30 minutes to order and they were sold out of half of the menu.  I shudder to think what it would be like when the whole garden is full (meaning 4x more crowds than last night.)  Go for the concept, but be prepared for a long wait for basic food.

They've got an enormous menu with choices for everyone. We ordered mild and got some pretty well-spiced dished. Delish, and with great intensity.  We felt it was a bit pricey for lunch, and they sadly do not have a kid's menu, but the food and service were very good - some highlights...  Nan - perfectly cooked with great char Chicken Tika Masala - excellent complex flavors (our favorite of the meal) Lamb Curry - ordered medium, which means spicy, but very tasty Okra - dry fried with perfectly camamelized onions  They also have an Indian grocery and shop next door, and extra parking in the back too.

The Society Cafe at the Encore was a truly outstanding experience and even better than the cafe at the Wynn....   Overall - 4.5 stars (and then we rounded up!)  Hosting - 5 stars Very professional & timely.  Service - 4.5 stars Again professional, knowledgeable  & helpful.  Food - 5 stars * Meatball appetizer - great!  Better than many Italian restaurants. * Crab Salad - very tasty!  Super fresh with paper thin chili pod silvers on top. * Chopped Salad - AMAZING!  One of the best I've ever had.  Each vegetable was picked at the peak of perfection.  The dressing was simply outstanding.  Bloody Mary - 4.5 stars Best one in Vegas yet (a bit pricey at $12 each).  Also, loved the Bloody Mary cart and the table-side preparation.  Decor - 3 stars Hip with black/white drapery and highlights of red.  But, more clubby than cozy, which seemed odd for breakfast/brunch.  But overall, it was  very memorable meal.  We would definitely recommend and return!

The food just OK, which was surprising since it got rave reviews in the Denver Post.  Should have checked Yelp.  My mistake.  Well, the decor was VERY cool, but it went downhill from there.  There seemed to be a serious communication problem with the waitress.  She told use the portions were very small and that we need to order more.  So, we ordered the amount she recommended for the four of us.  Well, we got enough food for 6-8 people, which is silly since we were obviously tourists and couldn't take the leftovers with us.  Also, I explained that my wife was a vegetarian.  But, we only got one true vegi dish.  Everything else had pork in it, which meant my wife couldn't eat it, which meant there was even more leftover food.  And, those other pork were greasy and just ok.  If you're in Caesars Palace, see the cool decor here and then eat somewhere else.

Visited India Masala two more times during our stay at the Riviera.  It's still about 3.5 star experience, but I rounded up for the following:  * Owner was very nice and helpful and told me that if I wanted spicy, just ask for extra chilies, which I did and it was much better than cheap-o packages of hot sauce.  She also explained some of the more exotic items on the menu to me.  * The Chicken Tika Masala was OK.  Granted, it was missing more of the complex Indian spices and became one- dimensional after a few bites.  But the nan bread was hot & fresh.  And heck, it's a food court and much better than Subway or pizza-by-the-slice.  * The Veggie Samosas were really quite good and came with tasty mint & tamarind sauce.

Visited several times during our stay at the Riviera.  Bar Service - 3 Friendly and attentive.  But when it got crowded, service started to slow down and it took a while to get a drink.  Table Service - 4 Straight up professional, helpful and attentive.  Food - 4 Shepherd's Pie was very good, fresh, and a huge portion.  A bit heavy on the mashed potatoes, but it worked.  It came with fries, which were excellent, but it became a heavy carbo-load.  A least two could have shared it.  Did like the option of authentic HP sauce.  Bloody Mary - 2 A bit thin and just tasted like Tabasco sauce.  Would not order again.  Beers - 4 A good selection of English beers & cider.  I really liked the red ale on Nitro, super creamy.

Great LOCAL food in an area awash with average mediocre chain restaurants.  * Ambiance - while in a strip mall, they attempted to dress it up with simple black & red fabrics and colors  * Service - very homey, helpful and pleasant.  Met the owner and had a great conversation with him.  * Cocktails - basic, but very good & reasonably priced  - Mojito: good balance of fresh mint, sugar & rum - $6.5   - Cuban Daiquiri: Served in martini glass.  A bit tart, but refreshing - $6  * Food - Great home-cooked flavors:  - Chicken & Rice served in a large bowl with wonderful saffron spice  - Pan Fried Chicken that was tender & flavorful.   - Vaca Frita: great shredded beef & onions  - Garlic Flounder was tender and tasty  - Plantains were great too  We'll definitely be coming back and encourage others to try it out too!
