I'm only staying here because I was told we had to for the volleyball tournament we are attending.  Since we have to be out of the hotel by 6am and breakfast is not included, I brought breakfast items to eat. No fridge but you can get one for an extra $25 per night yikes! Therefore people fill up their coolers with ice to keep their stuff cold.  I had to go to two other floors to find one with ice. No coffee maker and no microwave in the room.  I can stay at other hotels for half the price and get a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker and free wifi included!  I'll have to see if I have anything good to say when I'm not as cranky!

Love the food at Pork on a Fork.  The only downside is that there is limited dining area and the line to order can be long.

Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of QT.  I stop by various locations multiple times a week.  I generally have a great experience at this store but feel compelled to give a review in regards their brewed iced tea only.  I drink unflavored, unsweetened iced tea. It is no secret that if the tea sits too long or if the carafe is not rinsed between brewing the tea gets a nasty taste to it.   More often than not when I stop at this location, the iced tea is not suitable for drinking.  The staff is always polite and willing to brew fresh tea for me and but I would prefer to pay for my refill and get good tea the first time and not have to wait.  So if you drink this type of tea be sure to give it a taste test before walking out the door.  I will also add that in general I have more problem with the tea at the new larger stores than the small original footprint.
