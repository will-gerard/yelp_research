Best experiences and best jewelers in town. Being a very high-end jewelry boutique your time in there is worth every second. They will find the piece you have been looking for.

I like coming to this location, but today they were a bit sluggish and the veggie bar was messy as heck. It made me not want to choose my toppings. Im hoping it was just a one day thing.

My coworkers brought me a mustard grilled chicken sandwich and even though it smelled amazing, I saw the ingredient details online and BARF! Grilled chicken or not the numbers were pretty bad.

Its right by my work. The little lady at the register is always greeting and welcoming customers. The layout and place is clean and the pharmacy is pretty fast with prescriptions. I'm not too found of the folks that cough up a storm while hanging around.

I really like this location. I went here to meet an old friend and to get some gift certificates and they workers that I dealt with were really nice and professional. I remember having this one bad instance at another location, but I haven't been back to that one, and just come here.

I understand that if you are not wearing the "fashionable clothing" that they will look at you in a snobby manner, but face it..do you really think the staff shops there? It's a job and they have guidelines to follow. I mean when you go into Macys/Dillards don't you walk around like you own the place?   I love how this place has unique accessories compared to other department stores at a reasonable price. I enjoy this store the most with the neighbor Barneys.

I really like this place. I always change up what I get to eat. Overall everything is pretty tasty. I got the sea bass tacos with pork belly yesterday. The place is very well designed and elegant, I feel that many places are losing their "high end lounge" look. Even though this place is old, it still puts up a good fight in today's market. And yes everyone still talks about this place being the "pre-game" of once Barcelona's night club.

By far the best location in Arizona! had a great shopping experience with their better selection products here.  I had to come back and re-write this review because it got dinged. So to be more specific and not so promotional such as it says in the review guidelines..and I guess it does seem promotional.   So my experience was great at this location because of the product they have. For example the liquor section. If you haven't seen it before, they literally have a glass case that is stocked with high-end (hundreds-$17,000.00) bottles of alcohol. That's of course too expensive to me, but to have that kind of selection at costco while crossing off your grocery or around the home shopping list is fabulous.   If anyone wonders about the Kirkland brand alcohol. It tastes exactly the same to the comparison bottle that they have next to their brand. Costco buys the distillery off the competition and brands it their name. It's the same, just different bottling and wrapper so to speak.   One example review of the time I went,I hope this doesn't get knocked again.

Beautiful spot. I like the south portion of Thunderbird Mountain. It's not too long to get to the top and the views are spectacular. For my family including 3 yr old in backpack, and 90lb dog. we got up and down in an hour.   If you are ever thinking if you should try it, you definitely should. Its worth every step.

I like the idea of this and the pricing, but the chiropractor (not saying any names...bald) made me feel uneasy about his capabilities. I left Youfit as an emergency because I pinched my neck/left shoulder on a seated shoulder extension machine. As I walked in with my neck pinched on one side (you can totally tell - because my head was tilted slightly to the direction of the hurt side and that I had to turn my upper body to give someone any eye-eye attention. The chiropractor told me what I had and that he can fix it...how can you tell by just looking at me? Again I like the idea of this place, and will try it again, but most likely not at this location. The reviews here make me a believer.

Been here a couple times and it continues to satisfy me. If the portions were a little bigger, it would be more of a common place to go to.

I really like this gym for their machines, they have the basics and are in very good shape. I don't know about their personal trainers and staff personally, but for going in and getting a work out..it works and works well.

Once a month on a Friday my boss gets the entire company lunch. Well, we had capriotti's sub trays. Capri..who? was my thought. Never heard of the place but my coworkers were ranting on its way better than the more popular sub chains.   My first bite was amazing, it had turkey,ham,cranberry, it was delicious! Looked into their menu brochure and it was called the cran-slam club. I was definitely hooked after my first bite. I did try a second flavor and it was called the bobby. Also another great sandwich, but definitely didn't finish it. I was stuffed by the 3rd bite.   The following day I had plenty of left overs and it was still delicious. I gave it a 5 star because I was taken by surprise of how good it was, I didn't have to drive for lunch, and Ashley confirmed that the order was correct and nothing was missing. So that is a 5 stars in my book any day.   I will for sure stop by at least once this upcoming week.

I like how this place is growing on me. Protein bowls after a good workout and fresh juice to start your day right. This is one hard place to beat and I love the employees here. They always greet and have a smile.

I went to Dre's because I was recommended by one of my girlfriends. The lovely Danielle cut and primped my hair exactly the way I wanted it. It was such a great experience to finally find a stylist that truly knows how I like it. Danielle gave me a quick tour of the place because its a new location for them and it's nice. It's very well thought out to make you feel that you are at a high-end salon. Which is always nice, a little slice of hair paradise to be in there.   It was a bit pricey, but I will continue to pay the extra dollars to be blown away with happiness with every visit. Another great aspect of this is that they use my favorite brand of product, Kerastase from Paris. Love, Love, Love this product. It does wonders to your hair.   I was offered to have my hair styled and cut by another beautiful girl, but I don't want to take a chance with anyone but Danielle. Even my boyfriend mentioned that it looks great, and he never cares about my hair. So with that being said, That made all the difference to me! Ill be back soon ladies! :)

With so many nail salon/spa's out there I have decided to go a little more up north in phoenix/Scottsdale area to be in a nicer area, thinking the services will follow with their location.   I walked in without a phone call and they seated me within 12 minutes, which is great in my book without making a appointment. So Diane and Bena attended me to do my pedi and hand massage. It was a "ah" sensation through out my body and something I look forward to every time I come in. I have been here now 3 times and every experience has been a pleasant one.   I understand that sometimes people Google map services, but if you do come across this store, I high recommend this spa. I drive an extra 10 minutes to come here and it is worth it.   I give this place a 4 stars because it has great service, welcoming energy, they care about me, place is cleaner than most spas I have been too, and well I knocked off a star because it quite far from me.

I like how the chai has a bit more spice than normal. My coffee tasted really good from here. First time customer and I enjoyed the taste. The building on the other hand...infrastructure stinks. I would like to sit inside somewhere instead of my car.
