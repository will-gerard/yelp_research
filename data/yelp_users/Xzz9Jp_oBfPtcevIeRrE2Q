Previously have been solid on print work. Store hours 8a-6p. Have been waiting 29 minutes to pick up graduation certificates and store not open for their posted hours...lame!

Delicious sandwiches & salads. It's all fair priced fare at Acacia Cafe! Looking forward to trying a few more items on their menu. The Grilled Sonoran is a must try!
