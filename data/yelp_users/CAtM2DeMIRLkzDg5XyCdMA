Wow! The smell got me from the moment my dining partner and I entered. I could just tell things were "right" about this place. Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.  We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.  I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.  The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.  Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!  If you love Thai...GO THERE!

Been twice. This is our favorite Italian place. We always secure reservations, and this place actually calls you back to confirm if you've left a message during off hours.  We are always seated promptly. The servers have been here for, literally, decades. They treat us like family. Very attentive and professional, and often fun, as well. They make good recommendations if you aren't sure of something. We are usually a large group, but all of us are served promptly and wine kept flowing.  They accommodate celiacs. Gluten free pasta and sauces are tasty...cannot tell the difference. Our food has always been delicious and generously portioned.   Excellent appetizers and desserts. Salad not special, but otherwise standard. Wonderful bread and oil for the table. Be sure to relax with dessert, coffee and Sambhar or port wine.  It is a memorable experience. Old school. Highly recommend!

We went for a casual lunch on our anniversary because of the great Yelp! reviews. We have mixed reviews, ourselves, though. The lunch crowd was small...not a good sign, but it is near South Mountain, which isn't a hub of excitement during the week day lunch rush. Inside, the place is old and worn, but clean. The tables aren't very inviting. There are fish tanks with large fish in them. The place is warmer than we like, so the overall effect was a bit dark and muggy.  The people who work there are wonderful--extremely helpful and nice. Honestly, that is the only reason we decided to stay--didn't want to turn around and walk out just because it looked kinda grungy inside (that is, because the food reviews were all so good.).  The bottom line is this: Everything on the menu is seafood,and it is Mexican. We did NOT love our food, but we did not get sick later, either.  There are no other meats. If we were at the ocean I think it would probably be fantastic, but inland, uh....no. The fish tacos tasted extremely FISHY and not in a good way. The crab meat enchiladas were authentic, dang it, but unfortunately the verde sauce was too tangy and there was pimento in the mix. It left a "stale" flavor in our mouths.  We would love to know the day of the week the fresh fish comes in. If we knew, we'd go back on THAT day. Otherwise, skip it.

This place is a hike coming from Laveen, but well worth the drive. It sits in a small Scottsdale strip mall and is not a spacious restaurant. Once inside, however, you feel the authenticity and you feel at home. Japan is all around you---in the staff and sushi chefs, the service, but most importantly the food. You can get halibut here, but it might be sold out. So, if you see it on the board and you want it do not hesitate or you might lose out. We've had sushi from New York to San Francisco and many places in between, and this is the freshest we've had, short of visiting Japan. It is very good and worth paying a bit extra. We spent about $100 for lunch for two, but we didn't hold back and left full. And, of course you can eat cheaper here than we did. There is something for everyone, and the service is fast.

After my last review which states our $100 cost of a lunch for two (ok...we tried a ton that day)....I wanted to follow up with our visit for a birthday dinner last night. Three of us dining. We each ordered dinners. Two beers for my husband and hot tea for us. $87 total. It was a wonderful meal!

We LOVE Lo Lo's! Went tonight in search of a satisfying dinner and they didn't disappoint.  We both ordered the Lo Lo's plate: three pieces of fried chicken and two generously sized round waffles on each plate! So much food!  Really great stuff, it tasted homemade, like something we'd cook ourselves. It was so comforting and delicious. The service was lightening fast, too. We also like that the drinks are served in big mason jars. Some of the best iced tea we've ever had. Great decor, cool atmosphere. Jazz playing  through the speakers. Very comfortable and welcoming vibe. Lots of smiles from hostesses and servers. Good family restaurant, but also a cute date place!  Cannot wait to go back and try the grits, mac and cheese, etc. Pretty extensive and delicious  looking menu. So many choices!

I hardly want to tell anyone, because I want to keep the place all to myself.  WOW.  Be adventurous. Try the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, or the salty plum soda.  The soup bowls are gigantic. The egg rolls come with a platter of greens and dipping sauce. The prices are inexpensive and the service is great.  At 2pm all the tables were full. That tells you something.  UPDATE:  Went the very next day with entire family. We each tried a different rice noodle soup. Everyone liked what they got, but we will note that meat is more of a garnish, so if you want more meat, you should order an extra order of it ont he side, which a lot of people do. But just know that at $6-9 (depending on what kind of soup you order), you are getting a lot of food that will fill you up, if you like a lot of fresh vegetables, noodles and broth. The broth is heavenly.  On our way out we were followed out the front door to be given a rare treat: a macaroon ice cream sandwich, gratis. Now they probably don't make a habit of doing this, but we thought it was very generous, and it tasted out of this world!  This is probably going to be a go-to lunch spot form now on!

We moved to Phoenix from New York. Because the trees and pricing may be different out here we went online to ask for tree removal/trimming quotes. Four places called us to set up quote appointments. Harris was not the first place to call us, but was the first company to actually drive by and quote us (within one day). When Jerry called with his quote I was very clear about the fact that we wanted other quotes, and the guy was understanding and very nice. I said that another company was already scheduled out a few days later and that he'd have to wait to hear back from us. Again--he totally understood and was appreciative of my communication of that.  Jerry called back the next day to tell me that they had two other jobs scheduled near my house the following day, and would I consider having them come out and do the job? Jerry came down more on the quote, and it was too good to turn down. We asked how long it would take to remove one giant, overgrown and double twisted palo verde tree, grind out the stump and also to trim back the mesquite tree, which probably had never been professionally trimmed + all debris removal. (It was a big job). Jerry said that it would take two hours, and said that his guys would be there at 11am, if that was okay with me. He said that he didn't want to be pushy, but he wanted the job and knew we'd all save money. (we did).  I called my husband to confer and he agreed we should go ahead and do it, because at that time, one of the other companies had already driven by and given us a written a quote that was $100 higher than Jerry's. It was a no-brainer so I called Jerry right back and we scheduled for the next morning.  Jerry's guys showed up two minutes early (yay!) and the job was finished in ONE hour, on the dot. Unbelievable. You'd never have known that the palo verde tree had been there. The mesquite tree looked amazing, and the yard was spotless - no debris. I could hardly believe it. We LOVE it!  Payment was so casual--I simply called Jerry to tell him the job was done, and I gave him my payment over the phone. It was that simple. Jerry answered some questions we had about drip/irrigation tubing, and then he also recommended Whittier Tree Farm over on Southern in case we wanted to replace the tree we had removed. He told us that we'd get a discount there for mentioning his name.  We will call back next year to have them do all of our trees. GREAT EXPERIENCE.

This place is ghetto. There are no framed degrees on the walls. The floors are FILTHY. They do not disinfect the rooms between animals.  We adopted a dog from the Humane Society and came here for our gratis check-up. The entire visit lasted two and a half hours. The vet left me waiting so freaking long just to see her--and then the tech came in. The tech left after her work was done, and I was waiting again, this time for the vet (?) The vet did come in and she did an inadequate examination. She forgot to check in my dog's ears, but then realized it and came back to do that. Then she needed a tech to come help her, and had to leave the room to go find one.  After her exam she left the room again, and  left me hanging for 30 minutes with no communication. Instead, 30 minutes into the wait I popped my head out to ask what the wait would be. The receptionist threw me serious shade. A tech came in after that and had about 8 printout packets of care plans and their costs. So, basically, they left me waiting for THAT.  Every imaginable cost was on those plans, including a "flu shot". Give me a break.  The appointment was booked with Dr. Houser, but they put us with Dr. Salmon instead, without our consent (I had heard that Dr. Houser is really good). Dr. Salmon does not keep up with her appearance--she does not have a professional presence. However she clearly loves animals, as it is very evident when she is practically making out with my dog. She just isn't thorough. She should be able to diagnose more quickly--for example she did an ear cytology (a q-tip swab). She got a bit of goo, but never bothered cleaning my dog's ear. You don't need a lab result to clean out an ear and stick ear cream into it and just sell me the dang cream and cleaner there on the spot (which is what she should have done--for me it isn't about the money). She just wasn't good with PEOPLE.  No one should have to wait 2 1/2 hours to complete a vet exam. It took me 30 minutes just to drive there one way. My whole afternoon was shot.  I offered to pay for the ear medicine that came as part of the free package because I wanted to be FAIR. I knew I wouldn't be coming back and it made me feel guilty to take something that was free to me, but obviously an expense for them. To their credit they wouldn't take my money for that, but I made it clear to the vet that I was left waiting entirely too long. Her response was to transfer the blame over to ME. She told me that I could have asked her to come back with the ear results. Is she kidding me? She walked out and left me in there for half an hour. She never had any intention of coming back in there, and how was I to know? It was my first visit there (and last, that's for sure).  This place is disorganized. There was a lot of staff there, and no customers. They tried to blame it on "being too busy and short-staffed".  A good vet goes into the room WITH a tech and handles the whole visit together, unless the tech is left to do some simple things--things the vet should be vocal about. No one should wait for what I had to wait for.  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

Mistakenly ordered the chicken fried sirloin. I did this about a year ago and I actually had forgotten how wrong this dish is. This is a special Texas dish that should be so tender one can slice into it with a fork. It should be made with ground sirloin or double tenderized steak. The sirloin at Roadhouse was a thinly pounded out piece of leather with several veins of hard  grizzle running through it.. The fried outer layer was overcooked, over salted and smooth. It fell short of the layered, fried chicken crust this dish should have. They did get the creamed gravy right. The brown gravy is also  good, but salty.  Husband's sirloin was ordered medium well. What he got was charred on the outside, dark pink on the inside, throughout. He had to send it back, and we have never sent a dish back int he 15 years we've been together.  I did not complain about my meal because I realized this is just the way the dish is prepared there. But....I will never order it again. I don't even think we'll bother going back there.  If you do go, the rolls are still yummy and amazing. The beer is still cold and good. Don't bother ordering steak unless you are ordering filet, however, because their steak seems too leathery. It was pretty awful.  We were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible. It is NOT the delicious, tender, forkful of yum from your Texas childhood. It is the stuff of nightmares.

As promised I have returned to Sarajevo Care for another go around. This time I brought a dining partner. I had the steak sandwich and my companion had the gyros sandwich. Again I ordered the cabbage rolls.  The cabbage rolls were better than the previous day if that is possible. They are delicious!  The true star may just be the gyros sandwich, though. I loved my tasty and ample steak sandwich, but I was *this close* to stealing my partner's gyros sandwich. This Is The Place for gyros, folks! Omg!  We finished with the delightful Turkish coffee and our lovely server then brought us each a free dessert "just because".  We have such warm feelings for this place. It is on our rotation now. If you are curious you MUST try it!  We suggest the sausages, the bread and tyros and the desserts with Turkish coffee.

We weren't sure if we'd find a vet out here as good as the one we had back East...but....wow! From the front desk to the techs to the veterinarian, this place is special. The vet is incredibly knowledgeable, great with pets AND people and took his time with us, addressing every concern and question with patience, kindness and humor. He was extremely thorough and gentle with our pet. We've never met a better vet!

Just. Don't. Go. EVER. If you do, God help you. *kneeling in prayer*  Wish we could give this zero stars. But if we could, we'd give it 5 full stars for being "as scary as it gets".  Hubby and I love all kind of trashy things and we are open to all Chinese food experiences. We even did a U-turn to get to this place since we were really hungry.  The place was empty so we had many seating options. NONE of the tables were clean. ALL of the seats are ripped. The huge television mounted over the front counter was airing a DENTAL PROCEDURE ON ROTTEN TEETH. Seriously.  We almost barfed. The elderly Chinese lady who works there was watching this intently and wouldn't change the channel.  We ordered our meals and then searched for a semi-decent place to sit, far away and facing away from the television. We used our water on a napkin to clean our table by ourselves. The napkin came up black, and this is not even an exaggeration. We wish it were.  The food was as greasy as it gets.  The soup was the most horrifying. We'll eat hospital food. We'll eat airplane food. We'll even eat school cafeteria pizza squares. But we couldn't eat the soup.  The bathrooms were out of a Freddy Krueger movie.   We cringe just imagining what the kitchen looks like.  DON'T GO!!  We'd rather fly to China, drive through the poorest parts, stop off at a farmer's home and pay the wife to fresh-kill a pigeon for us and eat it off their dusty farm table than ever eat here again. And honestly, in China, we think this is a viable option.

I am very adventurous and I often stop in to check places out first, so I am glad I read the Yelp reviews before I did or I never would have found the place. Sure, you can see the sign out by the road, but the sign announces three separate businesses and there is no discernible entrance. You have to park in the back lot and walk in from the rear. There is no sign above the door. I wouldn't have found it if I hadn't known to look for it, and if I hadn't been brave enough to blindly walk into an unmarked business. You could park on the side, right where you pull in off of Central Avenue, but know that you must go in at the middle point where the two buildings meet, and it feels like a back-door entrance. You must be cool enough to know how to get in the place. (joking).  The menus are shit. Meaning, you really have to look around hard to find the menus--it's not like there is a big wall menu above the counter, which is how it SHOULD be. It makes it tough for people in line to decide what they want, because everyone is craning their necks around everyone else in line just to read the posted menu. It is TERRIBLE. So they should improve on that. However, that being said, the bakery items on display look fab, and to taste them is divine. I wound up grabbing a box of pastries and a coffee to go. Best scones EVER, and worth $3 a piece because they're big.  My Americano was not that good--it tasted like it was made from instant coffee. But at $3 it was big and it was hot and it was coffee. That was okay for me, but I probably will not order that there again. It looks like they have lots of much more interesting choices to choose from, and if I had more time I would have tried something other than my old stand-by.  The food menu exists...you have to use bifocals. But look for it because the lunch and breakfast entrees look WONDERFUL. The seating looks more conducive to coffee and cocktail drinking. There is a big long table inside that looks like you can eat a meal at it. It is community style dining. There are tables in back, and tables outside that look like you can eat comfortably there.  I have to point out that it is the most hipster/pretentious place EVER but in a good way. If you feel uncomfortable being judged by the hipster group, don't go. It is a really cool place and I plan on taking my sister there. She'll love it. My kids would hate it, but they are teenagers and think they're  too cool to be seen there, if that makes any sense. I loved it but in a fishbowl kind of way. I am not that cool, but I liked looking. What will get me back there is THE FOOD!  Oh, and the people are VERY FRIENDLY! :) ...which is always a plus.

Really, really good hot and sour soup!  Friendliest cook and counter lady, like, ever! You can get a feast for three for $20. The vegetables are perfectly cooked. The rice noodles are also well done here.  The place is great for take-out but there is an ample seating area and tv. It is modern, light and airy and very clean!

Enlighten yourself to the joy of an authentic honky tonk. NOT a dive bar. Rather, the South Mountain "locals'" watering hole. Live music on weekends, expert dancers on the floor. Plenty of boots and hats. Two pool tables. Not pretentious. Tip well. No credit cards. Don't be a dick. You'll be treated well.

Not A Good Value.  Wow, I 'm a bitch. I just realized that I gave Lin's Grand Buffet four stars.  Over the years we have become rather stringent in our reviews. There is no sense in being conciliatory when there are so many other restaurants to patronize. Our dollars go only so far. So if you are a reader who will eat just about anything you may like this place a lot. It starts out very promising. It is neat and clean inside and quite romantic, and the people are friendly. Great date night for intimacy --just not for foodies. If you have a trained palate you will get more out of this review. If you like anything, then you will probably not get much out of this review. We love all food--even truck food. We don't discriminate, but we give fair reviews and credit only where credit is due.  Started with the breadbasket. There were 2 of us, so only 2 rolls brought. They were small and stale. We also had the pepperdews stuffed with goat cheese (six per order at $6 a plate), and the bruschetta (we chose an order with half tomatoes and half crab meat. There were two of each.)  The goat cheese appetizer was cold- not at room temperature- therefore the sweetness of the pepperdews was a bit cloying, but redeemed with the pepper flavored olive oil. A dollar a bite! Kinda leaves a bad taste.  In our opinion the pepperdews should have been packed in extra virgin olive oil and stored at room temperature--and the cheese filling taken out of the fridge an hour before opening the restaurant. The entire appetizer should be room temperature--if they had been we could have eaten another plate of them. The idea of them is appetizing, but the presentation abysmal. Side note: The bit of green  on top was wilted to the point of browning and would make Chef Ramsey cry. Flair is not as important in our book. But, just saying...  The bruschetta, for the money, was a huge disappointment. While there was a sufficient amount of crab on each slice of toast, the bread was not fresh, it was not piping hot, and the crab was absolutely frigid. Crab should have been warmed up first, then served over PIPING HOT, TOASTY bread--which it was not. The crab was (obviously fake) another kind of flaky white fish. Barely passable. The garlic was abundant and good. The tomatoes were sweet cherry tomatoes. We would take imported canned San Marzanos al fiorno over fresh cherry tomatoes any day of the week. Just a disappointment.  My Sicilian husband pronounced the bruschetta as an  Italian would (broo-SKETT-ah). The waitress passive-agressively shamed him, by repeating it twice as most Americans say it (broo-SHETTA), which only showed her ignorance. Otherwise, she was extremely friendly and talkative and the service was consistently good throughout our meal. I am being very fair here. She was truly nice, but she was sort of clueless.  Our California Chardonnay was $29 for the bottle and our server described it as oak barrel aged. It had zero oak--so we think our server possibly made a bit of a mix up there. Anyway, it was just "okay". I expect a lot more for the money, but even then, we still consider $29 for a bottle a low price/every day price and yet it should have been better, but then wine is totally subjective in our humble opinion.  We ordered a margharita pizza because we didn't think they could possibly disappoint us with something as beautiful and simple as tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. Oh boy-- it was PRACTICALLY INEDIBLE!  The crust was decent, even a bit blackened on the bottom like we like it. And that's where that ends. The cheese was a fancy shred blend--like something you'd buy at the grocery store. HORRIBLE. Where were our fresh dollops of beautiful mozzarella? The basil was fresh and friseed, They put cherry tomatoes on this pizza! Not good Amano! Not good! The tomatoes were too small...too sweet. Just...wrong. This is not the pizza of our homeland. Barely palatable. The reason for one star.  In our ongoing effort to find something noteworthy we did something that is law in our book--if the menu offers creme brulee we order it, even if we are not hungry. Creme brulee is a godsend. Unfortunately, the creme brulee here is "meh". If you've had truly great creme brulee nothing else will compare. The best we ever had was at Cafe Cherie in Montreal. It was in a low, wide dish with a thick, rich custard and thick, hard sugar top. Amano serves a small light creme brulee with a sugar top as light as an angel's wing. If that's your thing you'll love it. The vanilla bean had a good flavor. It just fell short in our book, and again--it was frigid, like almost everything else we ate there. Amano--you must take things out of the fridge! You'd solve most of your problems if you did. We did not order the olives for fear they would be pulled from a fridge.

We are big fans of Switch for lunch!  It's a sit down restaurant and so you'll pay more than a fast food place, but having said all that the VALUE is incredible. Al the beef is angus. It is cooked perfectly. The chicken is tender, cooked well, without being rubbery or flavorless. The salads are wonderful. The starters are wonderful. And the iced tea doesn't taste like dishwater, which, in Phoenix, is always a great big plus!!  I can't say enough about the food because, well...it tastes like the owner truly cares about quality ingredients, decent size portions, keeping the cost to the customers low considering what you get, and well...just making everything taste truly special.  Inside it is busy for lunch and you might wait 5-10 minutes. It is nice inside, with leather couches to sit in while you wait. It is LGBT friendly, and has a sophisticated vibe. Restaurant and bathrooms are spotlessly clean.

4.5 stars!!   This place is so comforting, yet cool, and the food is really good and the drinks are, too. We had the gin and tonics.  Our dinner tonight was for business. When a vendor pays, everything tastes great, no? But this place was good good we cannot wait to return for more of the lovely cocktails. Decent portions, fair prices. The service was attentive and made very good food recommendations.  We had the beets, which are a good appetizer to share, however we were most surprised they are warm, as we are used to a pickled beet appetizer. These were still quite good, and perfectly prepared. The second amuse bouche was the brisket tacos. Highly priced at $3 per taco, but wow, wow, wow! They are small but oh-so-wonderful! We cannot complain when such a food is so tantalizing!  Our mains were the skirt steak and fried chicken with waffles. Green beans fresh and cooked not a minute too long. Just right. Seasoning a little much, but overall good. The chicken is cooked there to perfection. Perfection! Bravo, Tuck Shop! We will be back...soon!  The place is genuinely cool. Just loved it there. Lots of good parking across the street if the small lot is full. Easy peasy to get in and get served on a Wednesday night. No reservations required, but it did fill up as we sat and ate. Big tables would need a reservation (6+?)

Wow! Just love! Sent hubby out to pick up the food. Ordered the smaller portions to save money and so everyone could get what they want. Ordered one dish no sauce and one dish extra spicy. They accomodated all of our requests. We fed six people for under $40, and the food is GREAT!

Four and a half stars.  Found everything on my list but a ceramic terrine for molding meats or cheeses. Got a metal one instead. Got a deep skillet with the lid included in 18/10 stainless steel half off....a steal at $40. Did well, overall. They gave me a thick catalog for free. They will order anything not in stock. Many fun odds and ends for my home kitchen. Was offered help finding things. They even checked back with me later. The cashier was possibly the friendliest and most helpful person I've ever encountered in a store.

Will definitely go back. Worth the $5 extra for callous removal treatment. The best ever. No other place in Laveen compares. Staff is friendly and the salon was lively.

If we could give less than one star we would.  This place is corporate, which means they will do every procedure possible to bilk your insurance company. Not that we blame them, but it is a pain in the butt for the customer. Here's why:  You cannot make an appointment for a simple cleaning. This place makes you make TWO SEPARATE appointments: One for the check-up, and a SEPARATE one for the cleaning. AND...while you are getting a check-up, they automatically take bite wings/or a full set of films on your mouth...EVERY TIME... which is a real pain. So unpleasant. Our hygienist friend (unfortunately too far away from us) told us you can go 18 months--not every six like SW Dental makes you. And yes--I said "makes" you. If you try to deny service they screw you over. They will argue with you and sic other people on you. They may even deny the rest of your service.  The dentist here gives off a creepy vibe. The hygienists are a dime a dozen. Nothing special or personal about them. The receptionists are mean, AND they make you wait FOREVER.   Oh--not to mention they screw up your appointments. Over last two years all three of us have been screwed by these people. They double book appointments and make you wait over an hour. They call the wrong person for their appointment reminder. We correct them, but they never bother fixing it. They schedule on holidays--then tell you "yes, we are open that day" when you point it out--but then you show up and they're closed. Etc., etc. This place is AWFUL. HORRIBLE.  After two years we are done with them.  Oh--and DO NOT take your kid here for braces. Don't even get me started on how awful this has been for our daughter. And now we are stuck with them until they come off. The end.

I come here with a group of ladies for pedicures and socializing. We always call in advance. None of us ever has to wait because of this. The place is clean and the staff is friendly and professional and the prices are fair. They do a pretty good job here, and I recommend them.  I would ignore some of the negative comments here because those posters strike me as immature and impatient, and not too bright. Because, obviously  if you go on a busy day with no appointment you will have to wait, and we are responsible for checking ALL prices ourselves beforehand and not making assumptions on services rendered , regardless of where we go for services. Some (cheap/poor?) people do not like to pay extra, and they expect an extravagant amount of time spent on doing specialized things. (Nail) Art is subjective, people. Rudeness is a two-way street.

Sadly, I need to update my review of Laveen Nail. What I like about Laveen Nail is the proximity to my house. The staff is very friendly, and the place is clean and has nice massage chairs that work. They also always seem to have enough staff so there isn't a wait.  I chose the Deluxe pedicure today, at $40. Big mistake.  Normally when I pay more for a pedicure I EXPECT to get what I paid for, especially because in addition to that I am leaving a tip (I refuse to stiff anyone, no matter what). The deluxe pedi is your basic pedicure (soak, nail/cuticle trim, callous removal, lotion and polish) but ALSO includes a sugar scrub, hot wax, hot towel, plus an extra long massage.  Now...let me digress here for a moment..... It is just me, or are all these Asian owned day spas skimping on every last little thing these days? Rushing through and not doing a good job?  So there is that. Even with a basic pedi all the pedis I've been getting are rushed and pretty terrible. So much so that I can do a better job at home (and I usually choose that--because why pay for bad service?)  But with the Deluxe I was expecting to get more. So what I got was the rushed pedicure, a 30 second sugar scrub on each leg, and some really scalding hot wax in a slippery, cheap plastic bag. I couldn't move my feet because I had to hold them *just so* so they wouldn't spill out everywhere, which prevented me from fully relaxing. Part of the massage was a few rocks rubbed over my shins for about 2 minutes. Seriously? And then The hot towel was literally 30 seconds--just long enough to wipe off the wax.  The lotion rub was woefully pitiful. Weak hands, no passion or care. Just of the crummy  run of the mill pedicure factory variety. Each leg got about 1.5 to 2 minutes.  IT SUCKED.  I am rich. I have the money for these things. I shouldn't have to drive 15-20 miles for better services and better care. I'd seriously do this twice a month +tips if the pedis were better.  But I won't. I will never go back for those services from those people, and in general I just won't go anywhere anymore, because all of these people are so used to us by now that they all don't seem to give a shit anymore.  Look---we can all do our own at-home pedis, What we are paying for is SERVICE.   STEP UP YOUR GAME or I won't return. And if someone knows a better place in Laveen, or nearby, please drop me a line!

It's been well over a year since my last visit. I decided to give it another try. I wish I had remembered my last experience, but I guess it had been too long. I left with an "ok" pedi this time, but I also got a nail fill. I think I was seriously ripped off. I got the $40 deluxe pedi...but got gel toe nail polish, which usually costs a few bucks more. When I went to pay they charged me an additional $20 for the gel. No one charges that much more for gel...so it was $60!! And in addition to that, my fill was $32!! I've never paid that much before. And the guy took forever, and was no good at filing my nails. I had to teach him how to do it. Seriously, all my nails were slanted until I taught him how to fix it. So, all in all...don't go here. Way overpriced...and still just "meh". This is not a "spa" experience, either. You're still going to be treated like cattle here.

What an absolutely incredible experience! Orange Sky is located on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Resort. A private elevator whisks you upstairs, whereupon you are greeted by smiles and hellos by *every single person* with whom you come into contact. The staff is one of the friendliest and professional we've ever encountered. Great job, guys!! This is so important and so overlooked by other places!  So glad we made reservations on a Saturday night. We made our decision to go there in the afternoon so when we went to make the reservation, only 5:45pm or 9pm were available. Sunset was at 7:41 that night, so we went with the 5:45pm reservation. We wound up arriving late--a little after 6pm--but we were seated immediately.  It turned out that many other tables were available at that time, so if you go early without a reservation you'll probably get seated.  It didn't matter that we were early for the sunset, though. 6pm turned out to be the perfect time to enjoy the changing colors of the sky. And *that* is why I'm glad we made a reservation...because by being forced to go at 5:45 (in our ignorance we would have made a later reservation) we were able to fully enjoy the sky. The sun actually dropped completely at 7:41, leaving us with only light left until well after 8pm--no colors, so keep that in mind when calculating this! (Also, remember sunset changes during the year, depending on the season). We went one of the longest days of the year.  The space itself is unique. A modern main lounge area up front--with curved, modular seating and window views all around --further expands into another area where a piano sits. This area has additional seating and a dance floor.  You'll find the restaurant itself at the end of the long corridor. This hallway is flanked on one side by private tables with westward views, and on the other by two private party rooms and their state of the art kitchen.  Entering the main dining room for the first time is a treat for those who are already jaded by most high end restaurants. The room is vast, but warm and inviting, with a fireplace centered on the back wall. The 270' view is amazing. You can even dine or take drinks outside on the lavishly furnished patio. If you're lucky you'll see a glimpse of wild stallions running through the reservation  toward the east side. You can dress up here and ENJOY it. It is worth the effort.  The food here is stellar. We both had the Chilean sea bass, and shared sides of corn with chard, and green chile mashed potatoes. The bass was cooked sparingly and to absolute perfection, which delighted our server when we told him. (He said that many people expect it to be cooked more--which ruins the delicate texture). It was seared and caramelized on the outside and *barely* raw in the center--just a wisp. Perfect.  The sides were huge. Each side feeds two people, possibly three. We shared a full bottle of sauvignon blanc, drank tap and sparkling water, and finished with French press coffee. Our anniversary was earlier in the week, and the waiter brought us a gratis chocolate mousse desert with a "Happy Anniversary" message to share.  The bill came with two caramel/chocolate candies that seemed homemade. It was phenomenal caramel! Our entire bill was $130. We expected to pay more. We cannot recommend this restaurant enough! The value is there. The food, most importantly, is fantastic. And really...isn't that what dining is all about if you are going to go out with people you love to share it?  GREAT PLACE!!

$30 for an hour and $45 for 90 minutes is an amazing deal. Our massage lasted the entire time--no shortcuts. We began with our feet in a bucket of warm water and were told to lay back on the table while our feet soaked. We were massaged with reflexology on our head and face, shoulders neck, all pressure points. Arms, hands...completely. Feet and legs were next. After that we were instructed to roll over. Back, lower buttocks and legs were massaged. This was an all-over treatment. Very thorough! Remember--this is reflexology, so the massage may not be what you are traditionally used to. The massage is rubbing, stroking and massage of pressure points. On the feet it can get uncomfortable, however the end result is worth it. The entire lymphatic system is triggered to drain toxins from the body. We left feeling refreshed and completely relaxed, and no more hunched shoulders! Definitely going back! TIP: Wear loose clothing...your practitioner may have you undress in stages. Also, no make-up is best, as the face and head are massaged with oil. It is expertly removed afterward with a warm damp towel.

Best tasting broth in Phoenix. Hands down. Try the raw beef platter, and  fresh coconut juice. Large, very clean restaurant. Service is very friendly here. Be patient if it is busy, as the owner is the only server. It is tucked away in a sketchy strip mall, but TOTALLY worth it!

We've never had macaroons before, so this was a mini culinary adventure. We tried six flavors: chocolate, mint, raspberry, mango, red velvet and coffee. Each macaroon is about the size of an oreo cookie, but is less dense, but much more heavenly and satisfying than something out of a bag. All of the cookies were consistent in size, shape and height. Many of you have had macaroons before, so this review is for those who are curious, like we were.  We were expecting a denser "cookie" and a creme filling with a rougher texture. So, basically, we knew nothing about macaroons! :)  Well, we were absolutely delighted with the airiness of the cookie, the lightness and the satisfying oh-so-light crunch of the cookie's exterior. There is a faint chew, which lends itself to the ganache in the center, which is not rough, nor is it too light. It was creamy perfection!  The flavors taste like nature. There is no cloying sweetness, or "out of a box" manufactured flavors. I would assume that extracts are used, but they are wonderful with no heaviness. All of the flavors that we sampled are delicious, but it is worth noting the mint macaroon tastes of herbal mint, like something you'd pick right out of your garden. Bravo!  At $1.50 each cookie is a special treat. We will definitely come here to buy treats for the holidays and special parties.  We are thrilled to be able to say that the cookies, while gorgeous, actually taste even better than they look, if that is possible. :)

I wasn't expecting to be impressed, but I was.  Normally when I see a high traffic/expensive restaurant adjacent to a mall I'm skeptical, but today I was hungry and didn't want junk. The posted menu seemed inspired so I went in for a solo lunch at the bar. Very clean eating here, but they truly bring the flavor, and you will not leave hungry! Excellent choice for lunch or dinner.  Started with Pellegrino and black coffee. The bartender was friendly and helpful. I like exploring the different methods of cooking chicken tortilla soup so I started with a small cup of that. Normally I prefer a clear, strong broth with lots of chicken and cilantro. Seasons' version is creamy and thick. The fresh cilantro is there, as is the roasted bits of chicken--really liked that-- but it was almost too thick for me. There were a lot of tortilla strips on top as well. If that's what you like you will love this version. The flavor is very good.  The tuna tartare starter was the star, and had I known I'd be fuller from the heavy soup, I'd have made it my lunch entree. I was expecting sliced tuna, but what I got was so much better! They serve diced raw tuna over a bed of avocado/wasabi mousse that has a thin layer of pineapple salsa. The whole thing is molded like a larger sized tuna fish can (to give you an idea of the size). It is served with a cone of extra crispy/spicy flat breads. I loved everything about this dish!  For my lunch entree' I ordered the red mole beef brisket tacos --with lettuce wraps rather than tortillas (they give you the choice). There are three ample tacos to this dish, served with sides of cilantro/verde sauce and red mole/chile sauce. These tacos were amazing. I had to take my time as I was full from the tuna.  Very good experience. Definitely going back!

MEMORABLE.  We are very particular in our restaurant reviews, because we will spend $150-200 for a dinner for two and we expect a lot in return. This place does not disappoint. Started with cocktails as we waited for our table. We made a reservation, which is recommended if you want a table outside. I had a sazerac, husband had grey goose and tonic. Both made nice and strong.  Priced accordingly. I hadn't had sazerac since probably 1985 at a jazz bar in Dallas. Back then it was served in a sazerac glass straight up. Here at the House it was on the rocks. Supposedly made with absinthe, but it must have been the legal kind here sold stateside. Good drink. Strong and like a Manhattan, but better. Interesting.  Started dinner with the cheese platter. They were out of the truffle cheese, but we went with four others. It was served with dried cranberries, dried cherries, a fig jam which was divine, grilled toast and also some smoked almonds. The platter was a lot for two people, but it was our own fault for picking 4 cheeses.  Next was the salad.. husband had house greens and I had the deconstructed Brussels sprouts and spinach salad with goat cheese, walnuts and blood orange. It was amazing.  Had the Riesling and the Pinot Noir. Both excellent.  The entrees were the stars, however. I had pasta pillows with pork belly with a Meyer lemon zest sauce with fresh peppers, and my husband had the lemon chicken...wow! seasoned to perfection and the skin grilled perfectly, served alongside whole red potatoes that were mashed down in the skin. This was, by far, one of the best meals I have ever tasted anywhere in the country.  Finished with Stella Blue coffee, black. Perfect end. Brought home two desserts for the teenagers (and for us to bite into--who were we kidding?!) The custard with salted caramel and cookies and the canollis filled with chocolate ganache.  The chef here is Manhattan trained and it is evident. Can't say any more about how worth it it is to try this place at least once. Foodies will not be disappointed.  This is a very unique dining experience. The house is an old Spanish mansion. The courtyard is lovely, lit up with twinkling romantic lights, and the trees were sultry in bloom. Ah, what a fragrance! A must for lunch OR dinner.

Amazing salad dressing made the whole salad. Not cheap but healthy, fresh and really worth it. So much better than fast food junk.

Really good value. Two visits with the four of us--no one ever got sick.  Let's face it--we are talking about a Chinese buffet here, so don't expect a "foodie" review like we usually give, since all of these Chinese buffets offer the same quick fare. For that reason alone our ratings scale is based upon what college professors would consider to be a "sliding scale". Therefore let us continue...  We are awarding 4 stars to Lin's Grand Buffet for some specific surprises:  1.) The fried fish and fried shrimp were very good. Like, SURPRISINGLY good, especially since we are grilled fish/healthy eaters (but the grilled salmon that day was "fishy", thus the discovery of the fried stuff). Our suggestion is to try a very tiny piece of fish before proceeding further, since cooking varies from day to day.  2.) The cheese enchiladas are perfect. (Weird, right?) But we were craving them that day.  3.) Yummy "critters". Our other surprise was that our 19-year-old stuffed his face with little octopus and LOVED them. He had never had them before, either, and the whole thing started as a dare... He also piled his plate several times with the crayfish. All of it gross to us, but obviously not to him. The octopus are tiny and look like little cartoons. The crayfish are just like I remember them from playing in the creeks of Texas as a child.  There is a HUGE assortment of foods here--something for everybody. Ribs are good, but not too much meat on them, chicken wings are good, pot stickers are good. They've got everything you can imagine and more. Salad bar is a disappointment. Not too many healthy vegetable toppings. Very basic stuff there, including the ever present chocolate pudding.  The husband got two plates of Mongolian Barbecue, so to whoever mentioned previously they don't have this anymore, apparently they do still have this feature of the restaurant. Hubby liked it. Said the first cook "made it great" and the second cook (when he went back for seconds) "made it meh". Depends on your cook, we guess.  The sushi is uninteresting and dry. Full disclosure, we didn't ask for anything specific to be made for us, so we don't know if that is an option here. Can anyone enlighten us? (Thanks.)  The deserts are dry and monotonous--you know the drill on this stuff.  We refuse to call the soft-serve (which comes in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl) "ice cream". It is food-grade "D" frozen "treat". Nasty stuff, eat at your own risk kind of territory. But again, our son, despite himself and God love him, kept going back for more. Blecht!..and LOL! In our humble opinion, this was the worst part of our  visits.  We've always had great/attentive servers. We say the only drawback is the ripped seating. When we asked for another booth on a busy night the hostess laughed and told us that all of the seats are ripped. So, come on, Phoenix! Let's sit properly, mm'kay? This can be prevented. Otherwise the place is huge and kind of cool/pretty looking. It seems clean enough. Bathrooms are new/clean.

We love food and it is evident on both of our recent visits that the chef at Arrogant Butcher not only also loves food, but respects it, curates it and most important, is consistent with it.  If you are "into" food and having a great experience you most likely will find that here.  If you want to put on your feedbag you may not appreciate what this gem has to offer and may, possibly, complain about what you get for your bucks. You are not the droids we are looking for. Move along.  Both visits we delighted in the oysters. Fresh, shucked perfectly, no grit and just the right amount of brine. It would be a crime to overlook these. Sip them. Savor them with the cilantro sauce.  The starters with cocktails are served like tapas. Golden beets, chilled. Generous roasted garlic in oil with crusty bread. The only addition needed on the garlic was salt. Uncomplicated and delicious deviled eggs. The mule we had is is an excellent cocktail. The servers are menu experts on both visits and make excellent beer recommendations.  Visit one we had the sea bass and the beet salad. Our dining partners ordered the pretzel appetizer as a meal. The portions were enough without going overboard. We all were well fed.  Second visit the short rib green chili for both of us. Fried egg white perfect with runny yoke. Absolutely perfect. Seasoned just right. Unique. Warm. Satisfying. Served with a corn muffin crispy and sweet in some places with pockets of butter and pops of green chili. Utterly delightful.  Desert was the salted caramel pudding and the chocolate cake. Both served in half size mason jars and topped with real cream, whipped. Rich flavors, deep and sweet without being cloying. Excellent dark, rich decaf coffee. Exactly what dessert should be.  Service consistently excellent with knowledgeable waitstaff. We were never rushed. Parking was validated. Great experience both times. A new Phoenix favorite for us.

STREETEATS, STOP PULLING MY DICK!  This festival sucked. I 100% agree with Francis (below)!  We bought $50 VIP tickets and THAT part was actually okay. We wound up getting comped drinks. The Dj was fun and being in the shade with private bathrooms was a-ok. But then, if you crunch the numbers it boils down to this:  $50 VIP cost breakdown: $12 entry fee $8 in food $30 in drinks VIP only portapotties Shade (tent with a DJ in it) & outdoor tables to sit  It's only a good deal if you plan on drinking a lot, anyway. But then, the $12 covers parking, and when people travel together....that's a lot of money per car going toward parking--a real scam if you ask me.  The food part was ABYSMAL!! The food trucks didn't play fair. Smaller portions, triple prices. They were supposed to do better than that.  We paid $4 for fried chicken. We got= 1 lousy drumstick. $8 for funnel cake. Got a measly plate  of mediocre fried dough with powdered sugar. We paid $4 for jambalaya. We got a $2 at best--sample size portion. We paid $15 for two skewers of meat on a stick. One was chicken and one was pork with  bacon. We paid $4 for bacon grilled cheese. We got 1/2 of a sandwich on paltry white bread.  Eff NO!!!!  Portland, Oregon has the food truck game down. Scottsdale can kiss my ass. Supposedly the vendors are charging less because they know how much we paid just to get inside the festival, but the truth is that is just not the case. All of them overcharged!  No one played ball in a good/fair way. None of the food was good enough. The Lobster Lady line was over an hour long, and the lousy lobster rolls were $18 for a SMALL.  The music is a bunch of kids. SUCKED.  Food demo--most BORING thing ever.  The whole thing just sucks. Don't waste your time there.

Marsha Craven is amazing. She brings the perfect blend of professionalism and intuition to her classes, taking her students to a solid place of understanding  of the the many different modalities of healing. Her Reiki practice is well renown, and to learn from her is a privilege and an honor. I have completed the level III Reiki Master class under her tutelage and have found immediate professional success because of the confidence she ingrained in me. I could and would learn from anyone--but I'd rather it be from her.

Squid Ink is a sushi bar located on Central Avenue in downtown Phoenix (most central/southern-most edge of the downtown area). There is a fee for the parking garage, which is located in the same building. It is very convenient.  The hostess who seated us looked rather unkempt, and she had pimply shoulders, which were exposed in a stringy tank top and kinda gross, but she was friendly. At first, the service was slow. We didn't know when the server would come and take our order--granted the restaurant was full, which is actually a good sign.  Once we got our drink order in it took a few minutes longer than we would have liked, but then things got rolling. We ordered several courses, and quite a lot of sushi. All of our food came out rather quickly. Way faster than I would have imagined for any restaurant, much less a sushi bar (which typically takes more time).  The miso is excellent. The seared beef dish was incredible--the meat was tender, like butter. Amazing! The cooked salmon with the kale salad was "the best ever" according to our table guest. The sashimi platter and suhi roll platters were just a scosh sparser than we would have liked, but the fish was impeccable. Really. Wow!  House chardonnay was buttery, not metallic. Water and tea were refilled with regularity, and as the food arrived we realized the whole staff worked very well together as a team. More than five different people came and went from our table, making sure we were taken care of. Everyone was friendly and professional.  Over all the value was very good. The prices were good. We loved our meal and we are definitely going back there!  If you sit outside there is a misting system, so you stay cool. Plus, the people watching is really fun.  Happy hour is all throughout the week--half price "starters", so that's always a good deal.  We recommend!

Pomo is the best pizza in Phoenix. It is Naples pizza through and through, and the owner brings each guest a gratis cordial of his homemade creamy limoncello after each meal. It is not out of the ordinary to order one pizza per person. It is amazing. Get the Principe (the one with rocket on it.) Wow.

We have mixed feelings about The Gladly, but we will definitely return at least one more time for the pate' and to give some other dishes a try. The decor is urban minimalist hipster, the lighting is extra dim, and the restaurant was quite loud. There is an outdoor seating area that looks absolutely fantastic. We would go there again just for drinks outside.  Walking in on a Thursday night around 8pm for a late dinner, we were seated immediately by a very welcoming hostess. She told us who our server would be. Our server arrived late on the scene, acting very comfortable and casual--which is nice and all-- but she took her time in getting to us for our drink orders, and then twice as long to bring the drinks. The restaurant was not busy at all, and eventually she got into a rhythm with us. Overall, the service is very dicey--not a professional staff as might be expected at these prices. It's staff they obviously hire off the street without much experience.  I ordered a "Manhattan", but she brought me the "Gladly Manhattan". It was a nice drink (and pricey), but not what I was expecting. I'm in my late 40's and wanted my parents' no nonsense version of it over ice--so perhaps one needs to specify at this place, although I shouldn't have had to do that. I didn't order the "Gladly" version. Anyway, I rolled with it.  My dining companion ordered the egg roll starer and the scallops over grits as an entree. I ordered the pate' starter and a small plate of lamb riblets as my main.  The egg roll was tasty. The scallops were heavy on the bacon fat, which could have been good, but the added pieces of bacon were too chewy, and the scallops were not tender. The flavor was a bit overwhelming with the added pork fat. The dish should have been velvety--it was not.  The pate' was very good. It was the perfect amount for a starter, a nice amount, in fact. They pair it nicely with pickled red onion and capers, along with hot mustard and VERY crispy toasts. Adorable presentation and very good, especially with the bourbon. Not the best we've ever had, but overall quite memorable with the pairings.  The lamb ribs were a let down. Too fatty and not tender enough. The flavor was fine, but underwhelming. They do taste of lamb, but lack the gamey flavor of shanks, which I actually prefer. There was too much gristle on the bone, and the dish was overpowered with more of the pickled red onion. We feel the red onion is perfect for the pate' starter, but just wrong for the riblets. We wouldn't get these again.  We both ordered the chocolate caramel tart for desert. It looked exactly as described, but the crusts were practically frozen. It wasn't pleasant to cut and put into our mouths. The flavor was entirely underwhelming, and we couldn't taste the smoked paprika, the orange bitters...or the salt in the chocolate ice cream--all the very reasons we ordered them. It was boring and disappointing. We wouldn't get those again.  I want to like The Gladly more than I do, so we will give it another shot. There are so many other good restaurants in Phoenix, we don't feel like this one is up to snuff for the price. It isn't that great of a value. They seem to try really hard, though. I guess it depends on how spoiled you are to really good food. If you've been exposed to truly great food you might be disappointed here. It's average upscale dinner fare at very expensive prices.
