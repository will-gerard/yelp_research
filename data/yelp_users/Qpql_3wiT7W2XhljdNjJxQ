Never ever going back. The place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible. The food is mediocre, ihop may be better. Definitely wouldn't suggest to a friend.

I really like them! I was a bit worried bc my pup was very matted (thanks to my laziness) but they did a great job! a bit pricey ($57) but I have been to other groomers that are dirt cheap but soo not worth it! You definitely get what you pay for.   The staff was super friendly and treated my gigi kindly...definitely will take her back again!

Sooo worth going there versus "the other guys"..why pay regular price elsewhere?

Food is alright. Service is garbage. You would expect a lot more from a place with the kind of prices they have. If anything, the food is what gave it the 2 stars...

As a Salvadorian I must say, this place is pretty damn good. I've only had the pupusas and quesadilla and they're pretty legit! They're stuffed and flavorful! Restaurants tend to forget that the essence of a pupusa is it being stuffed! Definitely recommend to a friend!

Absolutely loved this place! Nice vibe and super friendly staff. I got an Americano and it was much better than Starbucks! The blueberry scone was so good, not too sweet. Just right! Can't wait to go back and try their food.

Great tacos! I had both the Papi and the achiote chicken...both super good! My friend also ordered the churros and they were amazing! Pleasantly surprised :)
