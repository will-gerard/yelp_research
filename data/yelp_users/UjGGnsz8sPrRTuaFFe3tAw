I have been to this location twice now and both times the Pizza was excellent.  The first time we had the pleasure of Franco being our server, he really makes you feel welcome and valued as a customer.  We had the Sofia and another pizza he recommended and they were both amazing.  My friends went back without me and he even asked why I wasn't there, amazing service! Make sure to try the spicy olive oil it sets the pizza off! Will be back anytime I am in the area.

I have been here many times and they never disappoint.  On Monday's and Tuesday's  the burritos are $2.50 and tacos are $1.25.  The Horchata tastes a little bit watery or they would have got a 5 star.

This is by far my favorite burger joint in the valley.  They not only have a nice selection of everyday burgers, every week they have a special to keep the regulars happy.  If you are not in the mood for a burger their tacos are incredible, I recommend the beef fresno tacos.  Have yet to try something I haven't liked.

Stopped in for lunch and got the lunch special. Great Price, came with 6 wings, 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $8.50.  Wings were big and meaty and had were cooked perfect with a little crunch on the outside but not overcooked. Sauce was great a perfect spice to it. Pizza was HUGE good flavor and the crust was amazing with the butter and garlic they put on. Definitely a must try if in the area!!

Called Mike and he gave me a good price to get my 6+ screen replaced.  He said he would have it done in about ten minutes and he was right.  Phone looks and works good as new.

About a 20 minute wait on a Saturday,  not too bad.  Had sports on the TV's.  Guys are cool to chat with.  I had Issac cut my hair.  He did a great job,  took his time.  A little more expensive than some of the other shops in the valley but its so close to my house that I willl definitely be going back.

Whay are you supposed to do when its raining out and you have a cold? A big bowl of pho.  This place has a great selection of pho.  Very clean restaurant and friendly staff.

Went to the pho king food truck finally today and was not impressed.  My coworkers and I have been wanting to try the truck for awhile.  Ordered the beef pho,  asked the guy to split it (wanted to order a couple different things) and he wouldn't.  The order was up quick, thought it was kinda pricey at $9 compared to some of the other places around.  The bowl was small, only 4 pieces of meat, more bean sprouts than noodles, and pretty bland.  I put 2 ounces of blending hoisen sauce and siracha and was still bland.  All in all I wouldn't recommend if you have been wanting to try this food truck like I have.

We went to Toby keiths this past Saturday night and definitely found the new go to spot.  The drinks were good prices considering other bars in the area.  The only reason why its not 5 stars is because it was pretty hot in the building.  Other than that it was a great mix of people and the live band was good.
