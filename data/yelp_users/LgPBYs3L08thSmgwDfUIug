I love this place..This is our go to spot when we touch down...I get everything enchilada sauce. They cook with lard. I took a star off for the wait and my cousin had a bad experience with customer service. The food should be a little kid friendly and staff should be more friendly with giving options.  They should have it together by now.

This bank is so slow.. always with 2 or 1 teller and 20 people on line.. in these days in technology age.. they should be more effecient with time.  Posting this while waiting in line .

Omg! Joseph should get a medal for fastest locksmith. He opened my 5 pin lock in less than 5 mins. Wow... he got here fast and efficient. I'm impressed and will use them again.

I made a reservation for this place a week in advance. left a voicemail and the host gave me a call back right away and reserved my party.That's a plus! We came a little bit late because we were driving in from California but we were only 15 mins late. however the host still allowed us to keep the reservations. Another plus!   The clerk , did a poor job in explaining the rules. When we walked in at 9:30 She told us that we could play as many games within the hour. when you purchase time. But they didn't make us finish our game nor did they make us finish our time. So I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager and he (Kevin Stone) took his own sweet time to come speak to us while he was talking on the phone. It was soo long that we had to walk up to him and stare at him for 5 more mins until he noticed that we were standing there.   However,   recently the Marketing Coordinator or lucky strikes contacted me on yelp and was really sorry about my incident. She agreed to give me 2 hours of play time back.    That  was great on their part. Lucky strikes has definately changed my mind about there customer service. The marketing rep has gone above and beyond and I really appreciated that establishment. So I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.   Kudos to Lucky Strikes and looking forward to giving them another chance.!!

I love Cassandra! she is very talented and takes pride in her work. She is really funny and we have developed a good friendship. I go to her for different hairstyles and she always nails it. Plus, my hair is growing!! When I first went to her, my hair was falling out. She was able to stop the breakage. With her recommendations, My hair is now past my shoulders. It's only been 6 months.. She's the bomb!!
