I'm not one to write negative reviews but it felt right as I had an awkward experience last night.  I had ordered a protein bowl and when delivered it was with the forbidden rice.  I failed to read carefully that the forbidden rice is standard.  I kindly apologized for not requesting brown rice and asked for a new one.  The employees told me NO, that per management they are not to redo a rice bowl without charging me the cost of a new one.  At 36 years old, I have never experienced a restaurant not catering to the customer's request for a change, never mind a small fast food like place.  The fact they stated it was the managements rule was beyond me.  Needless to say, I won't be dining here anymore.

My first Yelp review.  Hands down my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  In fact, I went to both this location in Gainey and the downtown one this past weekend.  Both were stellar in every sense.  The pizza, salads. service, etc.  Can't recommend this place enough.  Stop reading this and go make a reservation!!
