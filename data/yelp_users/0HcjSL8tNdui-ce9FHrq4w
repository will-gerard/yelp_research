First time ordering here and they deliver half of the food. So now I'm sitting here watching my wife eat and I'm starving. This was after them taking my credit card four times and then getting a manager to get it to go through. The driver gets here and ask for cash and said we have not paid and he had to collect before he gave over the order. He then calls the store while the food dies in the bag and is on hold forever. Once he gets on I can hear the same girl that took my card several times say she doesn't see one in there. Are you kidding me? I then ask to speak to his manager and he doesn't see it. I them explain the train wreck I experienced trying to pay over the phone the first time and he says he remembers and found it now. Unreal.. Then there was only one calzone. The driver says maybe it's sitting there and he will go get it and bring it back. He wanted to being back the old one that's sitting there possible close to an hour now. To wrap it up I call and ask to talk to the manager. I shared what happened and that I tipped ten bucks for a total of 55.00 and Ge says he can take the tip off. I said it's not the drivers fault and if any compensation is made it shouldn't be the driver. He says ok and apologizes and that's it. We will send another one... Bad experience, especially for the first time ordering here. Oh, and my wife said not to take it out on the chocolate brownie. It must be really good. When the kid brought back the food I have to say it was really good. Everyone was nice and I will try them one more time to see if this was just a fluke.

Horrible customer service! The owner Mr.Choi treats you like you are doing him a favor by being a customer. Very rude with no concern for the customer. I have not felt the way I have here by any other business not to mention the price I was quoted to put a button back on of five dollars!. Do not spend your money here.

I would recommend this company 100%. Jose and his team were professional and did a terrific job on the trees and all of the other general trimming. They also went back after with the blower to clean up the yard. Great company!

Great food, good service and a really nice atmosphere. The owners are friendly and care about the good they serve. This is not just your regular bad food. I highly recommend Bambino's.
