Due to my downtown Tempe location I've been getting flyers from Gus's taped onto my door for years.  A couple nights ago, I had a wicked hunger smack me in the face around 1am, so I decided to give Gus's pizza a shot.  Gus's flyers all scream about online ordering, so I wandered to their site and thought I'd give that a try.  I noticed right away that next to their $1.50 delivery charge was a 49 cent "service fee."  Being a poor college student, I decided to skip the fees and just call in for takeaway.    I call, speak to some almost-unintelligible knucklehead, and order my 18" pepperoni, sausage, and garlic using one of the many coupons that have collected on my desk.  Knucklehead says twenty minutes and I thank him, chuckle at amusing youtube videos for ten minutes, and then make the five minute drive to guarantee that my pizza will be fresh from the oven.  I hit up Delhi Palace a couple times a month so I know the location, but I had never been inside Gus's before.  I was immediately unimpressed.  Behind the counter was some mid-forties guido complete with slicked back hair and gold chain around his neck, and a couple of other guys who appeared to be trying as hard as they could to avoid working.  I tell them I'm here, and guido turns to chump number one, whose job it apparently was to make my pizza. It turns out he hadn't done so yet, so he tossed it together, threw it in the oven, and told me it'll be ready as soon as it's ready.  I pay (using cash to avoid yet another fee), sit down, and listen to the banter between the knuckleheads behind the counter and the disturbing douchebag at the table behind me, who apparently likes women much shorter than him that he can dominate.  Mothers, watch your daughters.  No, not the ones at ASU, the ones in junior high.    My pizza was finally done after about 15 minutes of angry birds, so I took it home and popped open the box.  The toppings all appeared to be right, but the smell was off.  Who knows, maybe they use the magical ingredient that makes their pizza as good as all of the one-review five-star sockpuppets who have reviewed Gus's say it is, but no.  Instead, I'm eating bland crust, oversweet sauce, and some form of dried chunks of garlic rather than the fresh garlic I was expecting between my meh pepperoni and tombstone-quality sausage.  It's important to try many things in life, but now that I've tried Gus's pizza I can safely say I'll never be back.  I don't care how drunk or hungry I may be, and how late it has gotten, Gus's is off the list.

A few weeks back a friend came to one of my board game nights and brought along an apple cider I had never seen before. It was delicious, so a few days later I popped by Top's to see if it was available. I couldn't find any on their shelves so the guys up front took down the name of the drink and my number, promising to give me a call if they could scare some up.  Less than a week later my phone rings, it's the folks at Top's letting me know that they have this awesome new cider in stock. I can't think of any other place that will turn around a customer request so quickly, this has locked me in as a loyal customer. Their prices might be a bit higher than a big-box store, but supporting a local business with amazing service is entirely worth it.

Today I decided to take a little light rail adventure, with Lux as the end goal.  I was very happy when I got here to find plenty of comfy seating and a menu with many different options.  I decided on the hot apple cider, topped with whipped cream. It blew my socks off.    I then settled myself in to a supercomfy chair on the wall and spent a while reading and people watching and generally enjoying my surroundings.  Everyone at this place was giving off good vibes, and I had a fantastic relaxing afternoon.  I will be making this trip more often.

I stop by Phoenicia once a week for the hummus deluxe with gyro - it's a perfect lunch, supertasty hummus and the gyro meat make my mouth very happy.  The folks that work there are always pretty nice, and I've never been made to wait an unreasonable amount of time for my food.  Very happy to have them in my neighborhood.

Cornish Pasty Company always lands on my list when someone asks me where to get a good meal in Tempe.

To all of you folks who stare in disbelief at the cheez whiz cans, this place isn't for you.  This place is for those of us who fell in love with Pat's Steaks and can't afford to fly to Philly when we get that urge for a giant slab of yummy goodness.  Seriously, I refuse to buy a cheesesteak sandwich from any shop that doesn't have the whiz.  The owner is a nice guy.  The fact that he tries to make conversation while you make your order when most cashier drones at other shops just give you disinterested looks is a plus.  True, the conversation may veer toward awkward or strange, but at least he's being personable. I won't take that away from the man.  The only thing that I don't like about Corleone's is the price.  I will still pay what they're asking for what amounts to the best damn cheesesteak this side of the Susquehanna river, but I'd be much happier if the prices lined up with what I used to pay at Pat's.  If the prices came down, I'd be there a whole lot more.

This place wins the trifecta of sushi:  It's good! It's cheap!  It's fast!  I know, those things combined normally lead to some quality time in the porcelain palace, but Teharu has figured out a way to make it work, and by golly it does.  It's not fancy, the cuts of sushi aren't huge, but it's all yummy and even if you place an order rather than wait for your desired roll to slide by on the conveyor belt, it's quick in getting to you.    One minus: getting/keeping the attention of the waitstaff can be a challenge, but the fact that your potential meal is wandering by you means that you normally only need them for drinks and to get/pay the check.

My search for the perfect plate of General Tso's chicken has taken me to dozens of Chinese food restaurants, large and small, all over the country.  I can say with confidence that this place is one of the better Chinese food restaurants out there.  I was not familiar with "New York style" Chinese food before, but apparently it means dingy restaurant, ugly chairs and tables, the same generic menu that you've seen dozens of times before, flimsy plastic eating utensils, and damn good food.    I will overlook all of the meh that is on the exterior of this place for the fact that they serve what I consider to be the best General Tso's chicken in Arizona that I have found so far.

It's been a while since my first review and things have improved. The projection is better, they have validation agreements with the garage, and they're bringing in more really nifty shows in partnership with Cult Classics and a few other businesses and organizations in the valley.   My new complaint is that they moved ticket sales from the booth by the door to the concession counter, which means there's often multiple lines of people buying/picking up tickets or snacks or whatever, but only one or two unfortunate souls juggling between them which delays the process. I'd be happier if ticket sales/will call happened downstairs to keep things moving at a pace faster than a snail's.

I love trying new drinks, but I'm a stingy bastard and hate paying too much for my brain-soft sauce.  With that in mind, I was very happy to learn of Total Wine and More, which is only half a block from work.  Their prices consistently beat all of the grocery and liquor stores, the layout is nice, and the folks working there were pretty nice despite being a bit eager for their day to be done, but I'll chalk that up to the fact that I got there 10 minutes before closing time.

Jamburritos is by and far my favorite food truck. The chicken jamburrito is amazing, their hush puppies are perfectly spiced, and their homemade lemonade is tart and refreshing. The guys running the truck are unfailingly nice, which makes the experience even better. It's absolutely worth your time to visit them at the biweekly Phoenix Public Markets or wherever else they might be that day.

It's late, I've had a very pleasant evening, and I find myself with pre-bedtime munchies. I'd cleaned my kitchen earlier and am loathe to fill my sink with more dishes, so after commiserating with a buddy about an acute lack of late night Thai in my neighborhood I search Yelp for places still open when Oliveo's Pizza pops up. Generally favourable reviews, so who am I to deny myself a potentially tasty late-night pie?  I'm happy to see that I can order online, so I pull up their clunky but overall serviceable interface and toss in an order for a pizza and some root beer within a few minutes. Also, no ridiculous fees for pithy shit like ordering online or using a credit card  like the ones Gus's tacks on to their bill. A big plus. One oddity, the quoted delivery time is nearly two hours away, but when I get my confirmation email it seems that their whole system is an hour ahead so I don't have to hold back the munchie demons until damn near 3am. Quirky, but nothing wrong.  So here I sit, waiting for my pizza, I'll write the rest of the review after it shows up and gets in mah belleh.  Well then. Color me pleased, the pizza showed up earlier than expected and is incredibly tasty. I especially love the crust, not enough places do it right. So now I have a late night pizza joint, I'm calling this a big win all around.

The Royale is my new favourite theater in the valley due to the movies they're screening. Lots of new kitschy stuff (but not too artsy or off the wall, those are left to FilmBar in Phoenix) and occasional old movies that deserve some big-screen love. Where else can you go to get your old-school grindhouse on one night and catch a flick about hunting mythical Norwegian trolls the next?

It's midnight and a half and I've got the munchies after spending an evening at the poolside drinking ciders and chatting with a great friend. I take the dog out for her nighttime walk and to grab the mail, and once I get home I go through the stack of weekly flyers that jam my mailbox when I come across a familiar name: Geno's.      Now this name means something to me. Geno's is my favourite cheesesteak, experienced a number of times during trips out to Philadelphia and perpetually missed. I feel some misgivings about seeing a new place that has blatantly stolen the name of a landmark, but decide to give them a shot having been wooed by their big bold claims of being open super-late.     I had passed by the location earlier in the day so finding Geno's was easy peasy, and at 1am there was no line so my order was in quick as a whistle. I mill about, impressed at a massive array of hot sauces on the counter but otherwise bored by the blatant ZOMGPHILADELPHIA decor.  In a very reasonable time the cute girl behind the counter hands me a foil tube which felt a bit light, but still held promise of tasty times.     Rather than eating in, I bring the 'steak home to give the meat juices and "cheese sauce" (apparently not cheese whiz) proper time to soak into the roll. Unrolling it, I notice that the paper wrapper inside the foil is remarkably clean,  and my heart sinks a bit at the suggestion of a lack of the aforementioned meat juice and 'whiz. I finish unwrapping the 'steak and find a roll unlike the soft, spongy bread that I'm used to, rather one that is a little dry and crusty on the edges and dusted with corn meal.      I ordered a whole because I'm not a little girl, so I tear the 'steak in half and notice how little meat is in the sandwich, so little that there's an entire inch and a half at one end of the sandwich that has no filling at all. Not good, but I'm in this for the long haul. I take my first bite into a center bit, and while the flavor is okay, it is markedly dry and not nearly gooey with 'whiz enough. I soldier on and notice a great inconsistency in the onions, some cut into thin strips and others still in big chunks. The rest of the sandwich was as dry as the first bite and the corn meal dusting on the bread distracts from what flavor was there.      In the end, I really don't feel like I got my nine bucks worth of cheesesteak so I'm going to file this place away as a late-night desperation call, but definitely never a first choice.

I went out this afternoon with one goal: get some hairs cut. Preferably on my head. I wandered over to Electric Haven, but their barber went on some mysterious walkabout with no indication of a return time. Now I'm not gonna be one of those assbags who claims that his time is valuable, but I'm also not gonna sit around picking my nose on someone else's time...   I pick my nose on my own time, thank you.  A quick search of google maps found a number of results, Dave's the most convenient to where I was. A short drive later I was there and within a few minutes I was in a barber's chair. The guy who cut my hair was personable and did exactly what I asked, because there's nothing quite as breathtaking as a freshly shorn Sam.   Reasonable prices, quick service, nice barbers, and a hot lather shave on my neck when the cut was done. If I'm in the neighborhood and shaggy, Dave's Barber Shop will be my go-to guys.

Earlier this week I checked out House of Shave Barber Parlor on McDowell west of Central. Haircut was 17, hot lather shave was 25, cash only. This wasn't just a lather-you-up, shave you off; this was hot towels, hot lather, more hot towels, slow shave, more hot towels, a cooldown, and then a neck/shoulder massage using this nifty little hand machine.   I have ridiculously sensitive skin on my neck and there was absolutely no irritation at all, both immediately and a couple days after the shave. That alone earned five stars.  The waiting area has comfy chairs, soft drinks, popcorn, and guy-centric movies playing on a TV. The decor is old-timey and awesome. You may have to wait a bit as this is a one-man operation, but the experience was worth it. Matt was unfailingly polite, engaging, and stopped at every step of the cut to make sure I was getting what I wanted. Spend a bit of money and support a small business.

I found this place one day while wandering aimlessly during my lunch break. I'm glad I did, as it's tasty, fresh, and a hit with friends. In an area swamped by Thai cuisine, 5 R Cha stands out with surprisingly delicious food.   The only thing keeping me from dropping a fifth star up there are four large-screen TVs tuned in to American sports or news channels. While the food is faboo, the place lacks any sort of atmosphere and that takes something away from the overall experience.

Let me get this out of the way: Go here. Eat their Italian beef. Smile for the rest of the day.  And now, the rest of the story.  My heart broke when Arizona Sandwich Co. closed their shop at this location, so imagine my surprise when I drove by yesterday after work and saw that an Italian deli moved in. It was immediately decided that I'd try them for lunch today.  Fast-forward to an hour ago, I pull up outside and am greeted by some guys out on the sidewalk clearly enjoying some rock music. I kid you not, I got high-fived as I walked in. Inside was nice and clean, the menus were simple and a bit liberal with the apostrophes, but I'll forgive grammar if the food is right.   And the food, it was very right.   I ordered their number one, the Chicago-Style Italian Beef. It took them a few minutes to toss it all together, so I hung out and listened to the good-old-boy banter. Everyone working (or hanging out) there seemed like genuinely nice guys, and when the food was done and bagged up every damn one of them fared me well. I dragged it back to work and unwrapped a slab of heaven.  The beef was tender but still moist. The roll was soaked through and only just holding it together, but did so throughout the nosh. The au jus was magical. The kind of  flavor which makes grown men shed a single tear of joy.   Needless to say I will be going back. Next time I'll see how their Italian Hoagie fares against others in the area. They have stiff competition, but if their deli sandwich is as good as the Italian Beef, I know Mama's will win by a mile.

This Loco Patron location just opened this week so take this review with a grain of margarita salt. They could very well improve.  I'm a sucker for good margaritas and have seen the signs announcing this joint for months, so when I saw it open I had to take a look.  My first impression is that they've built a nice little sports bar, but furnished it like a Mexican food joint. TVs all over the wall and bar, saccharine pop/rock playing over the speakers, and a rustic cabinet where they keep straws, napkins, and the servers' purses. It's a medium-sized place, not big enough for a huge crowd, but it'd likely handle about half an hour of a pub crawl stop before the place got uncomfortable and folks moved on.  I sidled up to the bar and asked for a house margarita and a menu, both came back quickly along with a free mini-basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was actually really good, mild for the gringos but just a little kick on the backend. The margarita, on the other hand, was pretty awful. It had the right color, but the guy at the bar used way too much sweet and not nearly enough sour. It tasted like a flat sprite. I also couldn't tell if there was actually alcohol in there, which is never a good sign.  I ordered fajitas and those were also a little sweet for some odd reason. Maybe not enough salt when they cooked it up, I don't know. In any case, it was edible but not at all remarkable.   When the bill came the barman rang me up for the wrong dish, overcharging me, but when I pointed out the mistake he quickly fixed it so no real harm done.  Mill Avenue has a bunch of existing Mexican food places, all with their own charms, and I don't understand why a business owner thought Mill Ave. needed another. So far these folks aren't doing anything which sets them apart from the others and I'd be surprised to see them still open this time next year. That said, I'd welcome improvements that prove me wrong. The ball is in your court, Loco Patron.

I pass by The Stand a couple times a week, but the missus isn't a big fan of burgers so I normally have to suffer a burgerless meal when we're out and about. I know, it's pretty terrible. Today I'm off work and flying solo, I finally take my chance and wander in. I'm so very glad I did.  I was immediately greeted by the friendly girl behind the counter, and she took my order deftly. I was pleasantly surprised to find my food ready mere minutes after ordering, and my special-ordered burger (no sauce, tomatoes, pickles; add bacon and onions) was exactly right. The patties were cooked well but still juicy, the lettuce was fresh, and the onions were perfectly grilled. The strawberry lemonade was tasty and just the right amount of tart, but I do feel like they added way to much ice to my cup before pouring. The fries looked a tiny bit underdone, but were still tasty and delicious. I asked for a couple sides of their hot salsa for the fries, it was exactly the right combo.   I'll be back, and I'll even try to sway the missus with promises of what I'm hoping are tacos just as tasty as the burger I ate today. Hooray for another awesome small business successfully making my tummy happy!

The Good:   The restaurant itself has a fantastic midcentury vibe with lots of open windows and nifty seating. The menu was packed with so many delicious-sounding choices that I had a difficult time choosing just one. Fortunately they would let you sub a pancake for your breakfast side so I got to choose two! The food itself was magical; everything tasted exactly right and the portions were perfect for a filling meal.  The Bad:  First off, we were told there'd be a ~20 minute wait to get in. I understand and have no big problems waiting at a busy restaurant, I even thought it was pretty whiz-bang that they'd take my number and text me when a table was ready. Half an hour later my phone was still silent so I checked in and it turns out that the girl had noted my phone number incorrectly. To her credit she seated us immediately after discovering the mistake.  Once seated one thing became immediately clear: this is a *noisy* restaurant. There were parties of boisterous, energetic folks whose voices followed suit, and I'm okay dealing with that. The problem is that the restaurant pumped in loud pop music on top of that, so there wasn't just the din of a busy restaurant but a cacophony of conflicting noises. If you are hung over or otherwise want a quiet meal this is not the right place for you.  The Manic Pixie Dream Girl (google it) who served us was nice enough, but seemed eager to leave the table every time she engaged us and ended up missing small details like the coffee my dining partner ordered and later cream for that coffee. Fortunately my dining partner had pre-loaded on complimentary coffee during our too-long wait for the table otherwise violence may have ensued.   The Weird:  While waiting for our table some old guy came walking up with his pot-bellied pig on a leash, the pig wearing a Snooze AM teeshirt. I don't always expect to see my breakfast before eating it.   TL;DR:  I have a full tummy, but dealt with too much noise and neglect to be satisfied with the meal or the experience.
