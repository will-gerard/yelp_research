They are never on time. I will wait an hour after my apt time just to see the vet. Ridiculous.

I have been coming to this place for over 5 years. The service is outstanding. Even after moving away and only getting to come in occasionally, they still know my name and what services I prefer. The salon is clean and all the techs want you to be happy with your nails. If you're in chandler/Gilbert and you're looking for a great salon, you need to check this place out.

I come to this location every once in a while and without fail they mess up one part of my order.

This is one of my favorite Scottsdale stops for breakfast. The drive thru makes it super convenient and the food is always good. My personal favorites are the croissant sandwich and the az burro. Their coffees are also delish!
