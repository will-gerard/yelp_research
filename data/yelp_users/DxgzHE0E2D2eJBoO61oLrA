Horrible experience! I come here about once a week and order the same thing every week. I order the lox sandwich and a small coffee. This week, as soon as I placed my order it was ready, which was awesome! But the bagel was cold and not toasted, so I pointed it out and they remade it. When I got it back, the toppings were so sloppy and I gave a funny look at it because it was so unappealing to eat, and the lady said she just scraped everything onto a new bagel so she didn't have to throw out anything. Totally fine! Then as soon as it entered my hands I saw a long black hair weaved inside the cream cheese (definitely not my blonde hair that was pulled back in a tight bun), so I brought it back and told them I wouldn't eat it, didn't want it remade and that I would not be returning. The lady then mumbled "we all have our hair back" and SHE had her hair down! It was almost 3 inches longer than her shoulders! They were so rude and I was so appalled at this kind of service. She ended up giving us a refund, but was so salty about it and made it seem like it was our fault. Will not be returning.

This is my number one favorite restaurant! The menu is so original and the food not only tastes great but is served so beautifully. The staff is all so genuine and kind. Very romantic! My fianc√© proposed to me here. We love it.

We have been here two times now and both times the service has been so amazing! The food is wonderful, we each tried something new every time. The manager is so personable and makes an effort to come talk with us and check up on things. Even the customers are all very friendly and I feel very comfortable here.

My husband and I are chipotle lovers! We go all the time and sometimes the quality of food varies here and there but what doesn't-the service! Recently when we have been coming we have been getting the BEST customer service at this location in particular! I asked for my favorite gals name-Carly! She is so personable and always gives us a fantastic experience!
