This is my favorite airport to travel through. I always get through security in no time at all. Also the food choices have gotten a lot better. I mean lolo's chicken and waffles is there now. Most of the time the weather is perfect to fly out, rarely delays. It's easy to navigate and fast to have a friend pick you up. Overall, my favorite!

This is seriously the best Cheba Hut location in AZ.  Rarely do I crave subs unless it's from the glorious cheba hut! I mean, who else puts an amazing concoction of guacamole, cream cheese, more cheese and vegetables on an amazing Garlic bread roll?!! Their creativity and delightful toastiness of their subs keep me coming back.  This location seriously has the best and kindest staff. plus they always have the ingredients to make my sub on hand. I'll be back for my next lunch break!

Lena's does both catering and florals. This location has their flowers while the catering location is further north.   Let me start with the flowers. I won a free bouquet for my wedding so I decided to turn it in. I got a gorgeous rose cascade bouquet It was absolutely perfect. It did what it needed to for my wedding except they canceled my appointment and didn't return my phone calls multiple times or waited days later to call.   The food was pretty decent except the major problem was that I gave them an allergy list. When they made our food for the tasting I told them I could not have mushrooms. When I went to eat my shrimp scampi, my husband stopped me from eating it because the whole things was full of mushrooms. It was a close call and it could have ruined my whole night by putting me in the hospital the night of my wedding. That big mistake is sadly why I have to give such a low review.

I've been here a few times but this is my first time going for the Christmas lights.   I love this place because it's great explore for free with the little ones and all the activities that do charge are pretty cheap or free with an adult ticket.   There are two trains you can ride on. One is a small one that is free and runs on donations. It's super cute and great for the little ones. The other train is a bit bigger and runs on actual steam power.Tickets are usually 4 bucks.   For Christmas they decorate the whole place with Christmas lights. It is such a great experience for the price and gotta love the fake snow. Make sure you dress warm since at night it gets cold.   They have Santa there to take pictures with and an adorable mini museum with model trains setup. There is even a future mini museum opening up dedicated to Family Circus.   Gotta grab your loved ones and check this place out. It's a great Christmas tradition and it's affordable for the whole family. Don't forget the hot cocoa and enjoy the free parking.

Out of all the Casinos in Arizona, this is my least favorite.  The casino itself is small and there are more tables than slot machines. The slot machines don't really payout well and most of the time all of them are taken.  The parking lot is pretty large for the size but it gets confusing with the valet right in the middle of the parking lots. You have to drive back on the street to get to the other side.   Overall, I would rather go to another casino than here.

This place needs an overhaul and some help.  My friends like to do happy hour and this place is by their work. They used to offer mudslides, sangria and other amazing drinks but now they have taken all that away. It's gotten to the point that there is pretty much nothing on happy hour anymore. I think they offered a margarita, two wines and a few straight liquors.   The food is super salty and there is almost no flavor to it. I usually get an artichoke dip if that. Though recently they added pretzel rolls with beer cheese and that is actually pretty good. Though, how could you screw up cheese?!   Last time we went, there was no hostess. My friend waited a solid five minutes before we asked a bartender for help. The only saving grace of this place is the wait staff. Most of them have a good sense of humor and make sure you are set. Our waiter made out night fun but everything else was pretty mediocre at best.  Bring back the mudslides to happy hour!!!!

Looking for a late night pick me up? Convenience? a quiet study area in an old bank vault? Well, then I guess you found the place!  Convenience is always important when it comes to coffee, this place has a drive thru to help keep you on your way. There's a large menu selection from lattes to frappuccinos. They even have Italian sodas! They have a pretty yummy breakfast burrito, bagels, pastries, sandwiches and other assorted desserts.   This place is open late and on the weekends they are open 24 hours. A lot of people like to relax here and study for exams around finals. The outside area has tons of seating in the shade to enjoy the cool breezes. Also a great place to have game nights with some friends.  My favorite drink here is the cookies and cream frappuccino. It's absolutely delicious and blends well with the coffee. Plus they garnish it with cookie crumbs. Yum Yum!

My husband decided to take me to his old stomping grounds and said we had to try this staple!!! Seriously, he was right (doesn't happen too often).   This restaurant has been in Chandler for years and offers a large menu of traditional Mexican food. There is tons of parking on the side and in front. The interior is a little small but considering how long it has been in this location, it is big for the time.   This is the place to go when you don't want to spend a fortune but want something delicious! I had a simple bean and cheese burrito but seriously, it was the best I have ever had. They even had mini fried cones that had different combos. I took one to go!!  The prices were great since they were pretty cheap and honestly I loved this little hole in the wall!  Don't forget the Horchata, always the best was to end a meal. Now go eat some awesome Mexican food, Cinco De Mayo is coming up!

We decided to go for brunch here on Sunday since our friend was visiting from out of town. The parking was a little chaotic but once we found some we headed on in. They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is great during the cooler months but I would avoid it during the hot months for sure.  The menu has your typical sandwiches for lunch and breakfast options. I decided to try the breakfast grilled cheese. For the price it was huge and they even added avocado to it as well as tomatoes. If anything get your egg over easy, it gives it an even better taste. We tried the side of biscuits and gravy and it was amazing! Definitely worth it even though they were a bit on the pricey side.  I would have loved to have given this place 5 stars but the prices were a little high for what we received and the parking was a bit of a mess. Also call in reservations if possible so you don't have to wait as long. Definitely worth a visit if you are near Scottsdale on a Sunday and searching for brunch.

If you love beer, you love breweries, this is the best one in AZ!!!   Four Peaks has a wonderful menu but an even better beer selection. Be on the lookout for seasonal favorites like the pumpkin porter or Imperial Russian Stout as they sell out fast.   This location can get busy during the weekends and sometimes late at night. It's a place you can relax, hang with friends and enjoy some good eats.  My favorite thing to order is the oatmeal stout shake. If you thought beer and milkshakes can't be friends, well you are mistaken. The beer compliments the shake so perfectly that it isn't too sweet, it's just right! Our favorite appetizer is the blackened chicken nachos. It's a large portion so be prepared to share with at least 3 other people or prepare for leftovers.  So come and enjoy a beer, you won't regret it!

Pita jungle is the perfect place to go for good fast food versions of mediterranean food. It's quick and a decent price. Plus if your health concientious this is a good place. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan choices as well. They have stuff for meat lovers too. Make sure to grab happy hour.  It's 3 to 5:30 and 9 to close. Definitely worth the value.

I love playing mini golf here.  Plus if you skip the last hole on on one golf course you can go a and play the other one. Good deal for the money. Of you want to save a few extra bucks buy your stuff online. They also have a water park, bumper boats, a race car track, laser tag and an arcade. If you want a fun and cheap day for everyone then this is it. Just a warning that some of the courses are older so I lost my ball a few times. I got some exercise at least

Amazing romantic atmosphere as you sit under the stars, beneath the trees with your love. This is a great spot to eat outside and there's plenty of room.   We went for the Valentine's Dinner menu and it was absolutely perfect. We started off with drinks and my favorite was the toasted. It had caramel whiskey, Frangelico, banana liquor, cream and cinnamon! Such a refreshing and sweet drink to start off the night. We split most of the courses except our entrees.   The lobster bisque was amazing especially with the mix of chorizo oil. The Gnocchi had an amazing blend of flavors and the presentation was beautiful. The best thing was the Bourbon Peach glazed prime rib. Seriously, I took some home so I could enjoy it one more day. We finished off with the Dark chocolate cake that had earl grey whipped cram and berry compote. The delectable garnish on top was beautiful and helped to wrap up the whole meal.  My suggestion is to go during their special events since they have different items on the menu. I still dream about that prime rib, the best I ever had! I wish it was always on the menu.

I went out with my family in downtown Gilbert in search of a place we never tried before. This place popped up so we decided to give it a try.  It's inside a little shopping plaza and seems small until you walk inside. The front area has a little shop and and a giant dessert case!!  We finally sat down and looked at the menus. If you love a lot of choices, this is the place for you. They have a lot of Greek foods and other foods as well.  I got the baked feta as an appetizer which had bell peppers, garlic, olive oil, olives and onions on top. It was absolutely fantastic! Definitely worth a try. I also got the tortellini with crab and white wine sauce. This dish was a prefect mix of the cream and crab together. It also came with a side of soup which was scrumptious. The pieces of beef int he soup were delectable.   The prices were a little high but all the food was great quality. I would have given this place more stars but the service was extremely slow. Luckily we had nowhere to be but if you were in a rush, this is not the place to go. It's more of a place you can relax and share stories for hours.  So go try some Greek cuisine!

This place is a hidden gem right near ASU. It's hard to find good places to eat near ASU since so many of them leave but this place is here to stay.   One night I was craving Greek fries so we decided to grab a few as well as some sides. So we grabbed a table and perused their menu. They have a lot of traditional Greek dishes but I ordered the Greek Fries and spanakopita. I asked for extra dressing and feta on my fries and let me tell you I was not disappointing. The ranch dressing they use has a bit of a bit since it has a heavy vinegar base. It compliments the saltiness of the fries as well as the feta. It is so filling that I couldn't even finish my spanakopita which was amazing. It had the perfect amount of spinach and the tzatziki was out  of this world.  The service was friendly, quick and the meal was cheap. Great deal for your money. You pay for your bill in the store which gives you a chance to buy baked items or other traditional Mediterranean foods. We love the tzatziki so much that we bought some to go as well as their ranch dressing.  Definitely check this place out and their metered parking in front of their restaurant is free after 6pm.

Romantic atmosphere, stupendous food and amazing service!  This restaurant is located at the back of the Farm at South Mountain. They only do night service but it is perfect. There is a special table set over to the side for special occasions. It has a wood burning oven decorated with beautiful lights. Perfect for a romantic dinner that feels secluded.  Every night the menu changes depending on what the chef prepares. The food is all locally grown whether on their farm or local farms. The food is fresh and you can taste it.   We decided to start our meal off with the cheese board. The cheese ranged from a local goat cheese to a delicious feta. They had a delicious sweet zucchini bread that was to die for.  For my meal I had a delicious pasta that consisted of roasted tomatoes and fresh cheese. It was superb. Renee was our server and she was perfect.   Take a stroll at night under the lights. It is one of the most romantic dates you'll have around phoenix.

I have always loved Godiva for years especially since my friend used to work at one. Their chocolate is delicious and the staff at this location are extremely friendly. The display has all kinds of seasonal chocolates and if you join their rewards program you get a free chocolate every month.   I got the hot chocolate and it was by far the best hot chocolate I have ever had. It had such a rich chocolate taste and didn't taste like watered down cocoa mix from the store. It's $4 and comes in a small cup but it's worth it for the quality. They also have softer serve at this location which I have yet to try. I hear it's amazing and I can't wait to try it.  The prices are a little steep on the chocolate but you are paying for quality. This place gets crowded around holidays so if you are in a hurry steer away.

This location used to be 24 hours but is no longer. The pharmacy seems to get my prescription wrong every time I go to pick it up. Overall, there are better locations than this one. It has a small selection and most of the time the employees look unhappy to be here. Not to mention the influx of homeless people that hang around this store. I suggest going to another one rather than wasting your time at this location. Hopefully it improves in the future.

I have been looking for a new eye doctor and I really enjoyed this place. The office is located in a small building off of Rural and Southern. They have pretty good hours and everyone seems to be happy to be there. When I first came in, they had machines that calibrated my eye pressure, color blindness and perception.   After that I went in for my exam. My doctor was extremely thorough and made sure my contacts were perfect before I left. They even have a little section to shop for glasses. A man that assisted me with finding a pair was so enthusiastic. I had never thought that glass shopping could be so much fun! Plus my contacts and glasses came in a timely manner. I'll see them again next year!!

The food is so fresh and you can tell the employees take pride in their job. If you want a nice day to take a walk around the farm as well as eat one, this is the place! The pizza is delicious and don't forget to get one of their seasonal shakes. Not to mention the fried zucchini is amazing! Get there early and avoid noon since the line does grow fast.

When I crave a gourmet cupcake, this is the place I frequent. Every cupcake is rich and moist. They offer gluten free options and also post allergy information. There are a ton of seasonal cupcakes as well. Definitely grab the smore cupcake while your there. It tastes like it just came fresh out of the fire pit but with a cupcake twist. Not to mention, I love getting a free one on my birthday.

Everytime I've decided to grab a bite at chompies I have never been disappointed. For one, they have a giant menu which covers breakfast, sandwiches as well as dinner specials. Basically any meal you wanted for the day, it is there. Usually they start you out with homemade pickles as a starter. Sometimes the batches are delicious and other times they are very bland cucumber bites.  For breakfast I suggest getting their eggs Benedict. I chose their greek one and was not dissapointed. The serving size was huge and the leftovers were even better. It was even served on this amazing twist of a bagel. Oh my, delicious!  For dinner I suggest the Jewish sliders. They come on challah bread which is made fresh. Sometimes it can be a bit greasy but it is worth every bite.  As for the deli. They have great selections of things you won't find anywhere. I like to stop in for a bagel in the morning. Their bagels are always fresh and the cream cheese is perfect. Not too hard or soft, just right. The also carry different bagels like salt bagels. Crazy, righr?!  Lastly their desserts are amazing! definitely share it or get it to go. I like the chocolate box cake personally. They also have breads and other selections to take home.  I almost forgot about the atmosphere. Around Jewish holidays this place is packed so plan accordingly.the summer is a little dead but it can be chaotic during the school year.

These are the best cheesesteaks that you can find in the valley. They taste pretty close to the ones from philly. Always get it with the cheez wiz.  Also get the cheese fries too. All the cheesy goodness!

I love the location of this place because it is such a great area to relax with a cup of coffee.  The staff are all extremely friendly and welcoming. Every time I go in, I feel like I have long conversations with the staff and I love it! Having a happy atmosphere just makes your experience always so much better.  My favorite drink to get here is the dark forest. It's a blended drink that tastes like a chocolate covered cherry. It's the perfect drink to grab when you are off to tackle a full day of shopping. Overall I love this place and it's my go to at Tempe Marketplace.

This is my go to when I want sushi on the cheap. The wait during rush times can get crazy but it isn't too bad. For top rolls definitely get their las vegas roll fresh out of the oven or the baked scallop roll. Their philly roll is pretty decent as well. They do have a menu you can order from which is great for those kids who are picky eaters. They even have chocolate milk and fruit cups for them. You can make reservations just do it a good amount of time in advance. The service can be slow sometimes so it's great that you can serve yourself. Just grab a plate and once your done stack them. Make sure you flag down an employee when you want your bill. This place also makes it easy to seperate bills at the table. If you want rolls fast just ask the sushi chefs when you can since most of the time you sit in front of them. Overall just test out as many rolls as you want because it's cheap and not so bad.  Just not top quality

We decided to give this place a try since It was participating in restaurant week. When you first come into the Phoenician there is a guard to Greet you. He's great at telling you where to go and is extremely friendly. When we went in to find the restaurant we had some difficulty at first. So my suggestion is definitely do valet parking to make your life easier. All the wait staff were welcoming and the decor was just elegant as well as modern.  Now the food...was amazing! I decided to go with the mussels which is a starter. It was literally a bottomless bowl of them in a delicious bouillabaes sauce. I had to share because I was filling up. The bread was nice and fresh. There were 3 different types as well as an amazing pesto oil. My main dish was the carbonara pasta. It had a fresh egg on top and as soon as I touched it, it went all over it. Made it super fresh and delicious!   Finally we decided to share one dessert. We were celebrating our anniversary so they brought me a complimentary dessert as well as a dessert wine. They were amazing. Everything was perfect. Honestly if you want something special, this is the place to go. Great Food, Great Service and nice and peaceful.

It's hard to find such wondrous greenery in arizona...but this is it! The paths are great to explore as well as educate. This is a great place to teach anyone about the importance of wildlife. There are kids areas as well as bathrooms. Great place for a picnic and you can even gaze at the stars at night. Definitely worth it and exploring this place is absolutely free.

I have been in search of new smoothie places because Arizona is just a smoothie induced climate!! Nothing like a refreshing drink full of protein and nutrients that is light on a hot night!  For the most part, the people working there seem to be all over the place. I have seen the manage a few times and a lot of different people making my drinks as of late. It seems to have high turnover.  Beside the staff, I find the drinks to be perfection!! There is only one size and that size is large!! When I'm in a dessert kind of mood, I get the peanut butter cup. Seriously, that thing is better than a shake and I am totally a shake girl! They have a diverse variety of ingredients and offerings for everyone!  If you want a good deal for your money and you don't care about customer service, this is the place to go!

I went here for the first time to try their new sushi buffet which is on Mondays and Tuesdays. I have to say I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the food.  They had their regular spread of food such as salads, meats, sides and other arrangements. The sushi section had about 5 different types of rolls. The salmon roll was the best out of all them which was nice and fresh. The other rolls such as the philly roll and shrimp roll were extremely dry, small and just disappointing.  I mainly filled up on a potato, fried fish and the desserts.  The desserts were delicious but it doesn't warrant the $16 dollar price. The place was pretty empty and honestly I can say it's probably because this place is missing the wow factor that some buffets have.  Skip this place and go have a nice meal somewhere else.

The atmosphere, the location and the drinks are perfection.  This place looks like a quaint little house with a beautiful yard full of friends you don't know yet. There is a lot of space outside with comfortable chairs that should be in your backyard. The atmosphere gets an upgrade with all the musicians that come to play. There is always someone new which brings a different experience every time.  The inside is small and cutely decorated. The baristas are all friendly and the coffee selection is small but perfect. There are seasonal items such as eggnog lattes that help remind you what season you are in. The chai latte is perfect and has a little bit of a twist that usual chais are missing.  The prices are great, location is prime and if you want a great drink, this is a good time.

The food makes up for divey feel of this place. We looked up french food and this was the suggestion from yelp that was closets to our location.  The inside has a kind of strange decor and the tables could use a little help but the menu selections made up for it. The owner has a french accent and you can tell she takes pride in her restaurant.  I ordered the croque Madame and my husband ordered one of the crepes. It wasn't a traditional croque madame but it was absolutely delicious. Definitely worth the money and I would get it again in a heartbeat. So if you want a little taste of french food for a good price, check this place out.

I kept wondering why everyone raved about this place. Everyone who works here is super happy. They try and speed up service when it gets busy by taking your order further in line. The prices are decent and the sizes are perfect. Get the kicker blended! It is amazing and tou won't regret it!

Usually I love this place but I just completely lost my appetite when my husband spit out a baby cock roach out of his custard. One of the grossest things to happen to me at this place.  Usually I love their burgers and food but this was just the topping on the cake. I know bugs get into supplies sometimes but that was a mood killer for me. At least we got 2 complimentary meals for next time I guess...

I loved this spot because it's a great hike for beginners. You can hike the front or back. The back has stairs which is great for anyone of any level to do. Inside is super shady and a great place to sit and relax. You can see all of phoenix from there. There is a parking lot nearby and other hiking trails as well. So go take a breather and stand on top of the world for just a bit.

Seriously!!! This place is a saving grace by bringing good seafood to the middle of the desert. I decided to try this place out for Restaurant Week. The menu has a large variety of seafood from all over.   As someone who personally grew up on the East Coast, I know and love seafood!! The clam chowder here brought a tear to my eye because it reminded me of home. All of the food was fresh and perfection! Even the risotto was spot on! Plus they give bread and butter with your meal.   At the front, they sell seafood for you to take home. I bought some chowder for the road and I found out they can special order Haddock for me anytime!! Nobody offers haddock here!   Anyways, I found my seafood haven and I couldn't be happier!!!

I'm a regular at this place because it is just beyond amazing! The owner makes all the flavors from scratch and rotates them out every week. there is even a reward program so you can earn free ones. Tuesday is double point day and Thursday is buy one get one half off but you get those points too. Parking can get annoying sometimes but usually you'll find one after a while. Plus if you get a late night craving he's open later than most. Get your froyo on!

This Hallmark brings holidays to life and has such a diverse selection.  I was at a nearby business when I noticed they had a special holiday event going on. We decided to take a gander and boy was I surprised. The inside is extremely large and split off into various themes.  The best room would have to be the room for Christmas themed villages. The displays were huge and they had every Christmas themed movie turned into Christmas towns. There is even an entire section dedicated to Halloween. We picked up some new ornaments for the tree. The only downside would have to be the prices and lack of sales but it is still a great store!

My review is based solely on the Christmas light display. They do such a wonderful job decorating the whole place top to bottom that it is amazing!! We went here on a date and it gives off such a loving atmosphere. They have a few displays up of the manger scene and a couple of other religious displays. They even put on a little play even though it's not entirely accurate. This place gets crowded towards school break so I would avoid it like the plague around that time. There's tons of free parking even though it may take a few minutes to find some. If you just love free lights and an enjoyable free evening, this place is worth checking out. As for the temple part of it, I have no idea...

Fieldwork Phoenix is a company that conducts opinion panels and tests products with consumers. They usually send weekly emails to inform you of different studies. I generally get to do about 2 studies a year. They ask you a lot of preliminary questions to see if you are what they are looking for. The pay is pretty decent as well. I got $125 visa gift card last time and this time I'm getting a $175 gift card. It's a great deal and it's worth the time. Usually interviews and questions are an hour to 2 hours max. Make sure you make a profile on their website and update your profile regularly.

For an aquarium located in a mall this is actually pretty good.   The prices can be a little expensive but be on the lookout between groupon and goldstar for some cheaper ticket offers. This place is great to check out during the summer months and doesn't get too crowded since it's not new anymore.  For a small aquarium they have a very diverse amount of sea life. There is no strange smell that some aquariums get and it's always clean. They also place a lot of great areas for picture opportunities. One of my favorite spots was the glass bubble aquarium viewer. It's great to see what it looks like from the inside and for candid pictures.   They have a lot of education talks throughout the day whether it's about the large tank or over at the area where you can touch sea stars. They have a giant play area for children and the gift shop has some cute stuff. A little pricey so I would try and steer your children away from it if possible.  Overall a fun place on a hot day to take your mind off of the thought that we live in the desert.

I Seriously love all their specialty pizzas here!  I would love to give this place 5 stars but the biggest issue with this location is how swamped it is. We went on a Wednesday and the place was overrun with children everywhere. There is a play area to the side but it is so loud that we took our pizza to go.   The staff seemed disinterested in being there but the food was perfect. I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and the toppings were perfect. The sauce didn't overwhelm the pizza and the cheese they use is delightful. Plus the chicken was still moist, not dry like a lot of places.   I'll keep getting pizza here but it will always be to go.

This store is definitely better than most of the jamba juices. They always seem to be pretty quick and make my smoothies the best. I know it's not the healthiest but if it's a hot day get the peanut butter mood. It's a delicious treat and I mean who doesn't love peanut butter and chocolate?! The strawberry fields is pretty good as well especially since.its not to bad on the calories. Best part is if you are a student on the run to head to class, it's the perfect place to stop by. Grab it on the go and feel better about you dinner or snack choices.

If you are looking for a cheap dress but want desinger, then head here! My friend is getting married so I came with her to check out dresses. They have a whole giant sale section to browse through.  What was nice is there were a lot of different styles, sizes as well as colors. She found a gorgeous 2,400 dollar dress for 100. It was unique and the customer service was great. We had her attention the whole time and she let her try on plenty of dresses. Overall a great experience and I cannot wait for her wedding.

This place is a hidden gem in the middle of the city. There is an oasis of plants all around it and the oasis known as heavenly ice cream.  Parking can be a little difficult but I can see why. Many people want to come here and it shows. The interior looked like a cute old candy shop. They had some interesting flavors and I liked that they had a mix of sundaes, floats and more.   Our waitress was amazing. She gave us suggestions about how to cater our treats to use and was prompt with making them. She even hand churned my ice cream to be like a shake. It was amazing. I would definitely get the Hocus Pocus again. Definitely try this place out, you will not regret it!

Fuzzys makes tacos tuesday worth it especially for all the deals. They have 5$ margaritas and 1.50 tacos. Doesn't matter if you want a veggie taco, fish taco or a pork taco they are all the same. If I had to choose my favorite it is definitely the fried fish taco.  My all time favorite dish is the bean and cheese nachos. It's super cheap and huge. Grab a few friends so you can finish it but it is absolutely delicious! Definitely worth it.  The atmosphere is usually very loud and always on the move. It can be hard to find a table especially around the evening rush. If you end up outside beware of the side by the misters. Many are broken and will just leak water all over you.   As for parking, they have abundant metered parking outside but it is often limited. So keep that in mind.  Overall, the best days for a deal are taco tuesday but be prepared for crowds and for it to be loud. Otherwise feel free to check it out whenever. It is a great staple to mill avenue.

Everyday I wake up dreaming about these bagels! This is the place to be!  The bagel man is such a hard working guy and is always welcoming to every customer that comes in. He is there pretty much everyday and has a hard working crew too.  The bagels here are seriously the best bagels I have ever had. I have even visited New York and these are on par if not better. Top cream cheese spread would have to be the scallion but the Lox comes in a close second for me. As for bagels, the salt bagel is the best I have ever had.   The prices are great and it's a great pick me up early in the morning. I'm already looking forward to tomorrow morning just so I can have a bagel.

After visiting this magic place I have managed to completely redecorate my house. It all started with a little Jar and soon it lead to many trinkets. Every week half the store is on sale which is nice. So if you see an item you really want, wait until the next week and your golden. It's super organized and the aisles have room to move. I find the most unique items there more than anywhere else. Even store to store is different. This is my favorite craft store and I bet it soon will be yours too.

The happiest people work here and in turn they make your day just as happy!  Love the loyalty punch card. It keeps me motivated to get my caffeine fix with the ultimate goal of a free coffee beverage of my choice. My got to would be the kicker because Irish cream always makes everything better! Only downside about this location and majority of them is the crazy line. If you don't mind a little bit of a wait, it's worth it for a smile, the price and the caffeine high!

I searched far and wide for food reminiscent of New England and this was everything I dreamed of. I literally stalked this truck down just to try a little bit of everything!  First off, all the food that is served is fresh and caught in Maine from someone the owner knows. She has it sent here and serves it throughout the valley during the spring months. The reason she always has a line, is because it's...that...good!!  Make sure you get there early or your favorites may be gone. First off, my favorite was the Haddock sandwich. It's great for the money and you will never find Haddock anywhere in Arizona, trust me! It was lightly fried to perfection and the aoli tartar they serve with it is perfection. The lobstah rolls are scrumptious and are absolutely worth the price! I love every single chowdah and lobster bisque offering they have. Every bite came filled with tons of hardy seafood or vegetables. Plus she doesn't mix flour into the chowdah to thicken it like so many restaurants do to cut costs and quality. The prices are high but you always pay this much for seafood, trust me, I grew up on the beach!  Let's not forget a typical New England staple...the whoopie pie!! It...is...perfect. The chocolate cake is full yet light while the filling is thick and creamy like a typical whoopie pie. My favorite foods from home have been brought to the valley and honestly I wouldn't have it any other way!   Thank you Main Lobster Lady!! You helped to cure my homesickness and brought some amazing food up to bat! Now go stalk her truck already, you won't regret it!!

I absolutely love four peaks and I love this location even more than their restaurant. We went here both years for the girl scout cookie pairing which was amazing. They usually have specialty beers on tap at this location since this is one of their main brewing locations.   There's a big bar and tables throughout to relax at. The cool thing is that you can see the brewing tanks from the window and the icing on the cake is you can get a free guided tour. They do not serve food at this location but they usually have different food trucks come in. There was a fry truck there for us to grab snacks and we got to bring them in.   My top favorite beer is their Russian imperial stout. This is usually the only location I can get some since the restaurant sells out instantly. They also have events, so grab a beer and relax with your buds. It's a hidden oasis away from it all.   P.S. there's tons of parking

I wish I could give this place 0 stars. We tried the food and it was not edible. Half the food was already falling apart such as sandwiches. It was soggy and just full of grease. Whatever you do, don't grab food from here, just a drink. You'll thank me later

The pretzels are absolutely soft and delicious. The only complaint I have is that there is usually a long line and the pretzels are sometimes super greasy. The best day is free pretzel day if you can go. It's usually.in april, so be on the lookout. Make sure to stop by at the end of the day, they are usually half price.

When I'm craving a delicious vegetarian sandwich, this is the place I go!  Potbelly's have been popping up everywhere over the last year. So I decided to stop in and I was not disappointed. The sandwiches are toasted and the portions are pretty decent. If you are looking for a sandwich bigger than your head, I would head somewhere else.  Their menu is pretty diverse. I got the Mediterranean which consisted of hummus and various vegetables. They all blended so perfectly with one naother.  They also have milkshakes!!! Get the oreo shake, they use quality ingredients and you can taste it. Plus they top it with cute little cookies that just add to the experience.   There is plenty of seating inside and out. So come on in for a delicious sandwich, it's worth it!

Personally I love going to main event especially on mondays. For 10$ you get all you can play bowling, gravity, laser tag and billiards or the all you can play game card. I would have given it 5 stars if we didn't have to wait for some things and if the shoe rental was included. We also tried the food and it was alright. Typical food you would find at an entertainment venue. So if you want to have fun for cheap go to main event.

I love french food, so I had to go and try this place out.  The inside is a very cute cafe feel. You order your food at the front and they bring the food to your seat. They serve breakfast only until 11:30, so If you want some breakfast foods, show up on time.   I ordered the croque Madame, my friend ordered the quiche and my hubby ordered the lamb burger. My croque Madame was delicious! It's near to impossible to eat it with your hands so I suggest using a fork and knife. It came with a crisp salad and it was nice and fresh. The lamb burger was amazing as well as the quiche. Both were fresh, hot and wroth every bite.  They also have a lot of desserts like macarons and tarts. Definitely worth checking out.

This is by far my favorite movie theater in Tempe. First of all...RECLINING SEATS!! You don't have to worry about fighting for a prime seat at a movie premiere, just reserve your seat online or in person.  The location is right off mill, so it's great to go to after a dinner date. As fro parking, make sure you go to a showing after 6 and park down the street where the meters end after 6pm or on Sunday. The prices of the tickets have dropped as well so they are more affordable.  Not too many people know of this cinema so it doesn't usually get too crowded. Plus it's nice to have your own space and not fight for comfort in your seat.  Catch a movie, chill and watch a movie!!

I used to live on the East Coast and we had Panera's everywhere!!! I like this location a lot because of the drive thru feature.   The best soup Panera has is the Broccoli Cheddar. For those who are looking to cut back on calories, this may not be the choice for you. The sandwich, salad and soup selection is nice because there is something for everyone.   If you are looking for some soup and good panini's then this is the place to go. Quick, simple and not too expensive. Plus their steak panini is delicious!!!

Seriously, this Gelato is amazing and is half the calories...a guilty pleasure that you don't feel so guilty about.  I wanted to try somewhere new and had heard this was a top rated ice cream shop. When we arrived, I could tell it was so by the line that went around the corner. I decided to tough it out and I am glad we did. There were samples of some seasonal flavors as we waited in line, nice  touch.   When we finally got to the front I got a chocolate peanut butter combo and it was amazing!!! Al the displays were so pretty and well thought out to show what flavors they were. The inside is very small so if your looking for a spot to hang, this is not the place. For a good treat and an awesome memory, hit up Frost.

My friend wanted to try this place out for her birthday so 6 of us went on a brunch adventure at Postinos.   We went on a Sunday which means all the metered parking is free and it's not too crowded. They offer $5 pitchers of beer on tap and the beer selection is great until 5. With one pitcher, 3 of us all had a delicious milk stout. They also have cheap glasses of wine and a great list.  We decided to sample different boards of the bruschetta and meat/cheese boards. Out of all the bruschetta we tried, my favorite was the salmon. The salmon was so fresh and the flavors popped. The goat cheese on the meat.cheese board was absolute perfection. Great for sharing and the price is great if you are sharing too. If you are not sharing then the prices can be a little on the expensive side  This is a great place to catch up with the girls or just a nice place to hang. Grab a glass and stay classy.

This place brings my favorite childhood treat back to life!!  When you first walk in, the space is small but decorated beautifully. To the right you are greeted by gourmet marshmallow treats for on the go. Straight ahead you are welcomed to a s'more making bar. Except you don't have to worry about burning yourself.   At the s'more making bar you can choose from their giant list of gourmet marshmallow concoctions. I ordered the peanut butter cup and my fiance ordered the Elvis. They make it right in front of you and you can take it to go as well. They were absolutely delicious and I loved the homemade graham cracker crust. Great quality!  They offer cold brews as well as blended drinks. The mocha has a mix of hot cocoa with espresso. The top has the most amazing marshmallow fluff that is lightly toasted. This drink was delicious though sometimes it took a bit to melt.   The customer service is amazing. You can tell they take pride in what they make and can answer all your questions with ease. This was my first visit and it definitely won't be my last.   Don't forget to check in for a gourmet pop as well. Now go enjoy a delicious treat made of awesomeness!

I actually stumbled onto this place because I won my wedding cake from them. After having my consultation and my tasting I fell in love with their cupcakes. At least once a week I swing by to grab a cupcake because they are that amazing.  First off, the frosting is light and perfect. It's almost a mix between a whipped frosting and regular frosting. No matter what, it is always perfect. Plus they mix it up by adding new flavors for the week so there is always something new to try. They are always moist, never dry and full of flavor.  The prices are great considering you are getting a true gourmet cupcake for only $2.50. My favorite is the chocolate on chocolate cupcake. Some places have a weird tasting chocolate but Sugarlips does it perfect!! Not to mention the decor is adorable. Stop on in and it will change your life!

My mother in law took us here on Christmas Adam. It's in a nice upscale area that is almost in the middle of nowhere. There's tons of free parking and they have happy hour every day, even on the weekends.  The inside has regular seating and spots at the teppanyaki station. We had the sushi only. All of the fish was fresh and absolutely delicious. The presentation was beautiful and every bit was perfection. A lot of their rolls are spicy so beware of that if you are not a spicy kind of person.  Our favorite rolls were the wicked an the poppin. Both were so good that we kept ordering more rolls to share. The prices are pretty reasonable for sushi especially considering their quality.  This place gets busy so call and make a reservation for the weekends or around the holidays!

I absolutely love this place. I would have given it 5 stars but sometimes their day service is slow. The food is all a decent price and the serving size is huge. So feel free to share some of your dishes. My favorite thing to get is the mediterranean mac and cheese. It has pesto in it and it is amazing! Their happy hour for small bites starts around 2 and goes to 6. So take a chance on the brie and bacon as well as the pesto goat cheese.

I decided to meet up with a friend here for lunch. I know this place had a huge remodel and it definitely has a mix of old meets new.  Since my friend was a little late I decided to grab an appetizer and a drink while I waited. I had the peach sangria and it was absolutely perfect. Great drink for a hot day which was nice and light.   For the appetizer I got fried pickles and they were absolutely delicious. The price wasn't too bad for them and they filled me up since I was starving.  My friend finally arrived and we ordered lunch. She got the taco salad and I got their pizza. I Read Reviews that the pizza might not be so good but It was surprisingly delicious. It had corn, artichokes, onions and an alfredo sauce. It was a nice twist on a pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The taco salad was absolutely amazing. It Was huge, A Classic And Tasted perfect. Definitely get the taco salad when your there.  Definitely check this place out, I bet the atmosphere is even better in the summer when you can sit outside.

This place takes the typical pub food but takes it to culinary genious. The pretzels and fondue are amazing. All the food is pretty good and the prices are what you would expect for a higher class establishment. Valet parking is free which is a nice perk. They also have games inside. Come on down and enjoy where the hipsters hangout. They know good food when they see it.

Out of all the room escapes I have tried, this one has been my favorite!!  It's in a nice part of Scottsdale and there is plenty of parking nearby. They offer a bunch of different rooms with different themes. So far I have only tried the apartment one and we figured it out with a minute to spare. There was a lot of cool interactive features in this one compared to other ones I have tried. I wish I could tell you more but it would ruin the secret of the room.  This place is the cleanest out of every single place I went to and you can tell that they take care of this place. They even went on to talk about how they change things periodically so if you come back, it will still be challenging. Okay, after writing this...I need to sign up for another one!

I wish I could give this place 5 stars but we waited over an hour for our food when there were only 4 other small groups of people there.  They changed this place into a sit down restaurant and I feel that could be part of the problem. Enough of my complaints, lets talk about all the good things. First off, there is something here for everyone from sweet to savory. I ordered the BBQ chicken one and it was amazing! The chicken was a mix of being lightly fried with a perfect amount of sauce. I loved the onion rings since they were the lightly battered ones.  The prices were pretty decent and I would go back again especially since there is ton of free parking. Hopefully next time my food will come out a little quicker.

This place is the perfect addition to Downtown Chandler. If you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere, amazing coffee and company then this is the place.  There is plenty of free parking right next door which makes it easy access. When you first walk in the whole place gives off such an amazing feel. There is brick on the wall with a picture of where the coffee comes from. The owner's family owns the plantation where the coffee beans are grown. You can tell they take pride in their business and their product.  The staff are all friendly and make you feel like you are part of their family. The menu is very simple but they're always adding new items depending on the season. My favorite drink is the white chocolate mocha. The chocolate in the drink is from a local company that makes gourmet chocolate. Every detail is considered when making these drinks. Their nitro brews are amazing and one of the best that we have found in the valley. Every time I take a picture of it, my friends are dying to know where I got it from.  What is great is you can see the roasting process often when you are sitting there because they roast the beans in house. They have tons of products you can take home as well. My fiance is always buying a bag to take home and goes on about how it's his favorite coffee in AZ.   They also do coffee bars at events and we are currently coordinating one for our wedding in November. All of our guest are excited and we are excited to make it part of our special day.   They do a lot of partnerships with local small businesses, which is what I love. Small businesses are an important part of our communities and make our experiences unique. There are some days they offer pour over classes, we keep missing it but hope to attend one soon.  If you love real coffee that isn't all artificial flavoring then check this place out. I will drive the distance just for a cup of relaxation. Absolute perfection!

I love chocolate but I love craft chocolate even more!!! The owners are passionate about their work and it shows with how much they know about their product.   We went for a chocolate factory tour and it was pretty amazing to learn about the process and all the work that goes into making chocolate. Being able to walk around and see the machines in action was quite remarkable. We had a chance to try a few different types of chocolate from their traditional dark to their new milk chocolate. Knowing where their beans come from makes it even better.  Some of my favorite chocolates were the marshmallow and the cup o' joe. They used Peixoto's coffee to make the chocolates infused with coffee. It was delectable and a perfect blend. They also make their marshmallow and caramel from scratch. So if you love buying locally and supporting small businesses, come on over and check this place out. You won't be disappointed.

I absolutely love ice cream and Dairy Queen has been a staple in my life since I was a child. I love this location because they have a drive thru when I am in a hurry.   The prices are pretty decent for ice cream and they offer a lot of choices. It seems other people have had issues with service here but I have always received a positive experience. Usually I get some upbeat and complimentary people that work at the drive thru. They also make sure the ice cream meets the customers standards or they do it over again. I love their chocolate ice cream and the chocolate dipper waffle cone. Simple yet delicious and satisfying.   So if you want some ice cream on the go, grab one for the road!!!

I'm always on the lookout for new coffee places in the valley that aren't a chain. This place is unique and extremely new. We went early in  the morning and they were working on hanging wall fixtures. Other than the the staff was extremely attentive and friendly.   We ordered the salted creme Brulee lattes. Since the torch the top you have to have it there at the shop. It is nice since it helps you take a break from your busy day to relax. We also decided to split a mini almond croissant. It sure wasn't little, i wonder what the regular size is. The pastry was perfect, fresh and great to share.   Lastly the decor is nice since it has that rustic modern look. We loved the feel of the place and can't wait to see it become more lively. We will definitely be returning soon.

I have been to MAD Greens twice. On opening day I had a chance to try any salad I wanted and I chose the TY Cobb. This salad is absolutely amazing. I also love that you can really customize your salad. So if you don't want certain things on your salad you can opt them out or add different items.  The serving size is huge. I had so many leftovers that I didn't know what to do with them. Definitely get a drink because their tea selection and drink selection is wonderful.  I love the ingredients they use because they make them fresh on site. Also most of the produce they use are from local farmers which helps boost our local economy.  I would have given this place five stars but was disappointed with my panini that I received on my second trip. The flavors weren't that great and reminded me that I should stick with the salads from now on out. Also the prices are a little high but it's mainly due to the ingredients they use. So if you don't have much money to spend, you might want to skip this place.  Other than that if you love healthy eating, this is a great choice.

We decided to try this place after I heard they were opening up on Mill Avenue. They had a free Poutine day so we decided to try it out.  The owner is extremely friendly and is very personable. He loves to hear suggestions as well as compliments of course. I ordered the Cheeseburger poutine and my fiance chose the regular poutine.  I've tried poutine before but have not had it meet my expectations until now. The cheeseburger poutine was an interesting blend of flavors and It was delicious. Though the regular poutine was perfect. The cheese had the squeaky aspect and the gravy was the perfect consistency. Overall it all blended perfectly and not a single bite was left. It was filling and definitely worth it. The prices aren't so bad and the hours are great if you go drinking during the weekend on Mill. So check this place out. Parking is a little hard so I would try to park near Fuzzys if possible which is metered parking by the way.  So if you want a piece of Canada, check out U.S. Fries.

This is the nicest and friendliest Ihop I have ever been to.  This place is fairly new and in a pretty decent location. It's 24 hours and kind of small but the inside has a great modern look to it.   The wait staff was very welcoming and made you feel like family. They are super sweet and honestly gave me one of my best experiences at an Ihop to date.  I got the double chocolate chocolate chip pancakes since I've been craving them for weeks. They were cooked perfectly and brought me back to my childhood. My hubby got the pumpkin waffle sundae and it was amazing! Definitely worth a visit to Ihop.

My experience at this place was not very good. When we walked in all the chefs tried to speak japanese to make it feel authentic. Sadly their japanese didn't resemble the phrase they were trying to say, it was just gibberish. The seating is quite uncomfortable and the whole place is small. The wait staff wasn't very attentive and screwed up my entire tables orders. The seafood ramen wasn't very good at all. The shrimp wasn't devained so blood from it got all the place. The noodles were the weirdest noodles I've ever had and the taste was strange. The prices were high for the quality of food I received. I will not be going back here and honestly there are way better ramen places around. Don't waste your time...very disappointed. Hopefully it will get better in time.

I think this is such a cute addition to Arizona Mills. It's a great place to take your child and let their imagination run wild!!!  Pros: Free parking, lots of things to do, cute interactive rides, great way to keep the kids busy  Cons: The ticket prices are a bit steep, some of the staff could be more personable  The whole area is warm, welcoming and fun! My favorite things are definitely the ride where you save the princess and mini Arizona. Some of the staff are super friendly and accommodating. Though I've had a few problems where staff are still unsure of policies or how the place operates. Fun new place for kids to escape the heat in AZ!

I have been wanting to try this place forever and it did not dissapoint!!!  It's located in the back with a dirt lot which made it hard to find at first but I appreciate all the parking. We went inside and immediately we were greeted warmly and with excitement. They gave us a walk through about their flavors and some of their specialties.   I did the one scoop with toasted marshmallow and a macaron on top. First of all, I love smores, I love ice cream and I especially love MACARONS!!! This was a beautiful marriage of everything I loved in on concoction. It was original but a twist on the classic. The Urkel ice cream was my favorite because Peanut Butter and Chocolate just belong together!  The decor is awesome because the art is so unique. I mean, I think I need a giant picture of Urkel licking ice cream in my house now. The chairs were comfortable and I love the blend of colors. Overall, I love this place!! Such an awesome addition to Scottsdale that has it's own unique flair!

I saw this on groupon and decided to try it with a group of friends who were visiting for the weekend. It was located in the industrial part of Tempe on Hardy Drive.  We tried the saloon one and it was a lot of fun. It can get chaotic with a large group so I feel they could lower the amount of people allowed in a room. Some of the clues were fun and for the most part we made it through with no help. The only issue we really ran into was that the safe was a bit finicky and took us 20 minutes to unlock.  I would recommend trying this again because it was in pretty good condition considering I have been to other ones over the valley that weren't as clean or nice.

Nothing like a night out with friends where you are trying to escape a room in an hour. This is the newest addition to Mill and I think it's a wonderful addition.   The business is owned by a father and his sons. They personally designed the puzzles and crafted the rooms themselves. We had the pleasure to talk to them about the experience and you can see the pride they put into each one.  We tried our hands at both the Inheritance and Jail Break. Each one of the rooms had its own little charm. The best part is that items move and it's amazing to see the chain reactions you can set off. Between being chained to your teammates in a prison or perusing some scary old dolls in grandma's attic, it is bound to be a blast! It keeps you thinking on your feet and wondering if everything and anything is a clue.   So go check this out already and see if you can escape. It helps to keep your mind in check and comes along with the bragging rights for winning. Now let's fast forward to June so I can play Lunar Lab! I'll be waiting!

I have been dying to try this place out and I love it!!!   Poke bowls are wonderful because you can customize it to include everything you love. They give you options of using rice, greens or a mix of both for your base. The fish was all fresh and the selection of ingredients was pretty large considering.   The prices were reasonable and makes it affordable compared to other places that offer sushi concoctions. My only gripe about this place is not having a menu to follow with you as you go through the assembly line. I luckily found one that someone forgot but it makes it hard to remember all the things you could add.   Definitely go try this place, its refreshing, healthy, and delicious!!

First off, I love Mellow Mushroom!! With that being said...This place needs a lot of help.  We went here on Memorial Day for some drinks and pizza. There was a wait but most of the tables were empty. We figured they might be short staffed. We then sat at the bar and got some drinks. The beer selection is superb and they offer a lot of local companies with unique beers. The bar was attentive and probably the best experience we had the rest of our visit.  After being seated, no one came over for 30 minutes until we finally flagged down someone. No one was assigned to our table so she volunteered. Finally, we put our order in and it was another 45 minutes until our pizza came. The pizza was piping hot out of the oven and delicious! We got the loaded potato pie and it's always a winner. When we went to pay the bill, it took another 30 minutes for our waitress to pick up our check.   This was probably the longest I have ever waited to eat something and I've been in parties of 20 people at a restaurant. There were only 4 of us. I hope things get better in the future since I love not paying for parking on Mill.
