This is the BEST Coldstone!  They are excellent partners to the community and support the local Tempe Public Library's summer reading program with free ice cream for kids.  Not only that but they are super friendly and also have the yummiest ice cream around.  You are great, Coldstone!

Very nice front desk staff and friendly and competent doctors.  Excellent hours that include Saturday appointments.  Glasses are a bit expensive as they are at most eye places.

I just finished an extensive remodel of our house.  AZ Discount Flooring did all the tile and shower demo and then they also installed a new tile shower, tub wall, tile floors, bathroom & kitchen backsplash, carpet in bedrooms, and wooden baseboards throughout the house.  They also cleaned and sealed all the tile afterward.  It turned out beautifully.  I am extremely happy with the final product.  Pros: AZ Discount Flooring had the very lowest priced travertine I could find ANYWHERE.  I did extensive research and their price ($1.99/sq ft for 24X24 travertine) could not be beat.  Their install price at $2/sq ft and $1/sq ft to clean and seal was also quite reasonable.  I had three different installers quote me anywhere from $3/sq ft all the way to $8/sq ft to install travertine.    The quality of the materials is excellent.  I absolutely love my floor tiles.  They are beautiful.  The glass tile and backsplash materials and the wooden baseboards are also very nice.  The quality of work performed was also good.   My floors are all even and the grout lines are 1/16 and look fabulous.    At the end of the project we had a surplus of tile and the owner, Marie, took the surplus and gave us a refund--keeping us below budget.  Cons: The store seems to do alot of business with contractors and sub-contractors.  Because of this, it is difficult for a layperson (like myself) to schedule and communicate plans.  Do some research on what you want before you go in and make sure you are prepared with your measurements and exact list of what you want.  Different crews do each part of the job.  I had a different crew for my demo, tiling, carpeting and baseboards.  This can be confusing as some parts of the job (like who re-installs the toilets or who demos the baseboards) could be performed by many of the crews.  Make sure you nail down all of these details to avoid confusion.  The project took about 2 weeks longer to complete than originally intended.  This was mostly due to a 1-2 person tile crew.  They did an excellent job but probably needed more help.    Bottom line is that you get wonderful quality for a very low price.  The trade-off is that you have to be the one who is on top of the project and be organized because this place is crazy busy.  If you are looking for alot of hand holding and quick return calls, this is not your place.  If you are looking for the best deal possible and you are patient and willing to do some work--contact AZ Discount Flooring.

Worst rental car experience of my life. After our Honda Odyssey was rear-ended, our insurance reserved a minivan at the Enterprise Dunlap location. The rental car's windshield was whistling, which I reported immediately. The windshield cracked the next day, while we were driving. We drove to the only open site, Sky Harbor, to switch out the van. At that point, we requested to switch to a Suburban as it would better accommodate our family size (3 in car seats and a camping trip--their minivan had captain chair setup which limited space). They told us they did not have any Suburbans on hand. They suggested we switch the van at the original site and to have the site manager call the next day to facilitate the request, as they could locate a Suburban anywhere in the valley and have it brought in. I called the original Dunlap site the next day and they told me there were no Suburbans to be reserved but they would try. A couple days passed and Dunlap site still could not locate a Suburban. I went to Enterprise's website which listed Suburbans as available at the Sky Harbor location. I called Dunlap to relay this info and they told me I would have to conduct the exchange through Sky Harbor as they did not have access to the Sky Harbor fleet. I called Sky Harbor to make sure they truly did have Suburbans on hand and was told they had several available.  I told the woman we would be coming in that same day. My husband packed up all 3 kids and drove 30 minutes during rush hour to go switch out the van. Once there, he was told they did not have any Suburbans. The manager on site, Samantha Smotzer, could not have been more rude or unconcerned. She told me her employees would not have said they had Suburbans on hand and I must have called the general call center. I assured her I called her specific location. She then said their website was inaccurate and even though it listed Suburbans as in-stock they did not have any. However, she told my husband in person that he could leave with a Suburban that day if he paid an additional $175 per day. I'm not even sure how that works as the Dunlap rental agent already confirmed our insurance rental rate would cover a Suburban. She then told me she could switch out the van for another but we would have to pay a $250 deductible for the damaged windshield. I explained that it was whistling and I reported it but she insisted my husband had told her a rock hit it (he did not). She was rude, passive-aggressive, and a horrible representative for Enterprise. She had zero concern for us as customers. I plan to call our insurance company, Safeco, and insist they re-evaluate their relationship with Enterprise. I also hope Enterprise seriously considers how damaging employees like Samantha Smotzer are to it's general image. I wish I could give this zero stars.   We will be going back to Dunlap Enterprise again tomorrow to return van.

Wonderful local establishment with a very family friendly owner and staff.  I love bringing my kids here for popsicles--and I love the fancier and more unique flavors for myself!  Extra points for having a gated in courtyard where kids can play safely and use the provided chalk. The owner, Pam, is also very involved in the local community.  GREAT local business!!

While the ambience and service were great the food just wasn't good.  We had the shishitos-small peppers that were fine but nothing too special, skirt steak appetizer and the notorious BIG burger.  It was all just ok.  I would only go back again for a happy hour because the 40s were fab!
