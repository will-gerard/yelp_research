Thank you Home Depot Paint dept for being too busy watching videos on your cell phone with your manager to try to help me with my problem; instead, telling me you "couldn't do nothing" for me and to go take my best guess. Is some level of customer service really that difficult to muster? My last visit to this location.

Glad we dodged a bullet. Tried to rent a home from them. Called and called. No call backs. When we did get a callback, they were short and rude. The only way we were able to view the property we wanted was to pay the application (site unseen) and even then still couldn't get a call from anyone about the status of our application. Very poor customer service.
