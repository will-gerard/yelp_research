I used Classic Party Rentals for my wedding. Lets just say I paid a hefty amount for linens and didn't get what I paid for at all. I was delivered the wrong shape of linen and multiple different colors of "navy blue". A few days before the wedding so there was nothing they could do! I had to re-arrange everything so my wedding could look decent. Then I was slapped in the face with a large "cleaning" bill for stains that I'm pretty sure they made up. Maybe try a different place before you settle for this company!

I waited like 20 minutes for a big mac meal! I thought its supposed to be fast food a perfect place to go when you need a quick lunch from work. Customers after me were getting there meals before me. And when I asked for Ranch the cashier gave me one little packet. Terrible service this time.

Such an awesome joint! They have one of the best salads (for a person that is TRYING, to eat healthy) and the most ridiculously delicious burgers (for someone who doesn't care about their weight aka: my husband). We've tried multiple burgers, deserts, and drinks, and they have all been yummy. Definitely love there home made ketchup and different take on ranch! We'll need to head over again real soon!

Oreganos is always spot on! Amazing Service, food, and atmosphere! Definitely one of our favorites spots to go for dinner! We always split a Kick-Ass garlic bread, a plate of Big Rig pasta, and a white chocolate macadamia pizza cookie! Some of the best stuff at Oreganos!  We bring all our friends/family that visit from out of state here and they never let us down! We love you Oreganos!

Good selection and prices but HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE alternations department! My now sister-in-law got married two years back and found her dress at Schaffer's, all she needed done was some sleeves added to the dress, they couldn't even do that well. She warned me not to get my alterations done with them, but I had some credit and thought it would be easier. My dress fit perfectly and didn't need to be taken it, the only thing I needed was a little trim on the length, and to add some sleeves. It took 4-5 visits just for this. My dress looked dirty by the time it was done, and the sleeves began to tear and come apart on my wedding day! Imagine having to tuck in your sleeve and adjusting all day long! Not cool. Also I bought a BRAND new belt for the store and the beading was coming off, they said they would fix that, but they forgot too. My aunt was stuck sowing it back on, on my wedding day. I had to point out multiple ways to fix my dress, the lady had no idea what she was doing! DO NOT GET ALTERATIONS DONE AT SCHAFFERS! There are plenty of talented seamstresses elsewhere.
