Our water heater blew this morning and when I called Dirt Dog they said they could be over in 30 minutes.  They replaced my water heater in just over an hour and were very reasonable.  TJ was great and I am so happy to have hot water again.  Awesome and quick service.  This is our 3rd time using them and I will definitely call them again.

I took in my engagement ring from my first marriage and got store credit.  I used the credit to have them convert a rather large necklace with a lot of sentimental value to me,  into a pendent and earrings.  The workmanship was amazing and cost far less then I had expected.  They took excellent care of a rather meaningful piece for me.  They also fixed a ring for me and made it better.  With my remaining store credit I was able to buy a lovely ring with a huge piece of amber in it and an amethyst ring, silver chain, and a gift for someone else.  I went over my store credit but it was so worth it.  The staff at Diamond Jim's are thoughtful and just lovely to work with.  Skip the mall and go to Diamond Jim's.  I have worked with them in the past selling jewelry and buying more pieces.  You will get a much better price and experience at this small gem of a store.

In October 2013 my then boyfriend and I drove out to Venues for a romantic date night of wonderful atmosphere and food.  Venues had both.  At the end of the meal he proposed!  We were delighted that the staff (who were in on it) made the night so special.  Fast forward 18 months and after our destination wedding we returned to Venues to host a special party for close friends.  The private room upstairs was the perfect location.  We worked with Celine and Catherine to create the perfect menu.  It was a magical evening.  The staff was amazing and attentive.  The food was off the charts amazing.  We could not have asked for a better experience.  If you want a romantic, non-rushed, dining experience this is a great place to go.  The private room is worth organizing a large event!  Thanks to everyone at Venues.  We hope to celebrate many anniversaries and special dinners there in the years to come.

This was our first time to visit the Pecan Grove Restaurant and Pie Co.  Walking up the restaurant I saw that most of the customers were a lot older then me.  So I had a premonition of how the food would taste and I was right.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with mashed potatoes and bacon mac and cheese.  My boyfriend ordered the meatloaf.  The dish came to me cold.  I asked them to reheat it and all they did was microwave it and the meat turned chewy and not good.  The Mac and Cheese was awful.  Not much bacon and really I think it came from a box.  Real cheese is not neon yellow.  Was really disappointed in that.  The gravy was so so.  Not sure it was homemade but it really had no taste.  My boyfriend said the meatloaf was meh.  Not great not terrible and not memorable.  The salads were actually very good.  Nice mixed greens.  We tipped out of pity and won't be back again based on the entrees.  The pie was good.  They do make a great pie and really wish they had just stuck to that.  They really do that well.  If you are older and like a more bland menu then this is the place.  I like my food a little more inspiring.
