One of my favorite chain restaurants.  The chips and salsa are near perfection.  I usually get the combination plates and most items are surprisingly good.

I hate places that act as if you are stupid the moment you walk in - "are you sure you left your precious wedding ring here to be serviced?". YES!  It was only 2 weeks ago, I think I would remember where I left it!  On top of that when they did locate my jewelry it was damaged.  3 diamonds were missing from my band.  They then basically accused me of it being that way when I left it.  And then tried to get me to sign the piece of paper that said I was satisfied with my jewelry.  The only remedy is that they REPLACED the missing diamonds free of charge.  I appreciate a business that fixes screw ups but don't mess with a woman's most prized possession

I'm obsessed with this place.  I feel bad for just getting around to reviewing it.  We go every Thursday.  Food alone this place is 5+ stars, it's so fun to sit on the traditional side.  Bring out of town guests.  I am not vegetarian but prefer the vegetarian ethipioian food.  Everything is good but I love all the lentil dishes, the cauliflower floret crunch and the Ethiopian coffee with Orange coffee cake is AMAZING!  Service is hit or miss and I mean really hit or miss.  Go early when the crowd is small.  It seems as if there is always one server working.  When it gets busy, make yourself comfortable. :)

There are so many other Mexican food restaurants in this town, go elsewhere.  I have given Tia Rosas so many chances and am continually disappointed.  I am sad to write this review because I want to like it so badly, it's a great location and atmosphere but the goodness stops there.  The food is bad, the service is AWFUL.  They keep you waiting at lunch (check and food) constantly have dirty dishes, or things floating in your water, get your order wrong, and when it's right - it's just not good.  I've tried a lot on the menu: burritos, enchiladas, seafood enchiladas, fish tacos, Carne asada, etc.  Nothing at all worth talking about.  I hear the chicken mole is good but I'm not paying $15 for anything there.  The final straw came today when 1- there was food in my water glass, 2- my order came out wrong and 3- my $17 bill was rang up at $30.  No remedies for all of these folies were offered.  not going back.  No more chances.

I have just left Cafe Essence from one of the worst experiences at a restaurant.  After waiting nearly an hour in the crowded, noisy and small dining area where people mill about like vultures for your table.  My food arrived.  As a vegetarian a giant lump of sausage was not appetizing.  My husband spoke to the manager who handed him the plate of food that was correct.  At that point I requested a simple bowl of granola as the previous plate was highly unappetizing.  The manager refused and kept pushing the plate at my husband.  She was incredibly rude asserting that I should just take the plate and that I had no right to change my order to something $3 cheaper just because *gasp* it was meat!  I don't wantto get into a philosophical debate as it's not a persons place to judge my choices, especially someone I am paying to make my food.  But she had no right to make those assumptions.  So thank you Cafe Essence for judging me, refusing to make it right and still providing horrific service despite this mess.  This review would have still been poor despite your lack of caring for your customer.  I have been able to send food back at Denny's with no questions asked.  But Cafe Essence is so high on it's horse that even with their own mistakes they'll still argue that YOU are in the wrong.  Their food is not good enough to be put down and degraded in front of other customers.  Take your business elsewhere.

I am SHOCKED to hear people complain about service.  This has become my go to restaurant on weekends for just that - service.  I am a stickler for good service and this is top notch in the valley.  The servers are friendly and prompt and the food comes out quickly!  And oh my goodness the food.  The French toast is the best I have had anywhere!  It's amazing and a must try for anyone (and I typically don't care for French toast).  Their coffee is delicious and I love how they give you a whole pot.  All of the food is so fresh, I think I have about had the whole menu!  Like I said, it's my weekend hang out spot.  I also cannot say enough about the turkey, avocado bacon for lunch.  I am so lucky to have Egg & I in my local stomping grounds!  YUM!!!

EDIT - I am updating a 5 star review from a year ago to a 1 star?? HOW terrible!!!  My 5 star remains below...  It is with a heavy heart I write this review.  I never understood why this restaurant got such low ratings until lately.  I cannot keep my mouth shut any longer and will no longer consider myself a regular.  Today we arrived and noticed the restaurant dirty.  And they no longer had sweetener other than sugar (asked for Splenda).  When asked we were told "the economy is bad."  OK no biggie.  So order: biscuits and gravy, eggs over hard and crispy bacon.  Biscuits are like dry discks and WHAT is in the gravy?  Mushrooms or sausage?  So rubbery I dont know.  Eggs are runny and bacon is just fat.  Sent it back.  Comes back the bacon has OBVIOUSLY been microwaved to sawdust and the eggs are FRIED to a CRISP!  I was shocked.  It was repulsive.  I kid you not, I fed it to my dogs who were out in the car and they werent not even thrilled to have bacon!  The waitress even told us when I mentioned the bacon that the "quality has gone down."  UMMM OK!  Kicker - we were charged for it.  So long Egg & I.

Tad and his staff are amazing.  A friend convinced me to finally try Hair Pollution after she continually came to work with gorgeous and creative styles.  I had recently had hair trauma so was very leery of anything at all.  After 8 months of not allowing anyone to touch my hair I followed her in.  I am so so Soooo glad I did.  Tad knew exactly what had gone wrong in my previous cut and color, how to remedy it and I left feeling and looking like a million bucks.  I have never had so much fun at a salon either.  The scalp massage alone was worth going.  I also found the price for services incredibly fair.  I cannot wait to go back!!!  Faith in humanity restored. ;)

Best Greek food I have had.  Ingredients are fresh and full of flavor.  My favorites are the falafel pita and Greek salad.  Service and food are both top notch for affordable prices.  Good vegetarian options as well.
