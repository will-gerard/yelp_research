I don't always eat Gyros, but when I do, I prefer Jay's Gyro's... hahaha! Ok all kidding aside this was the first place I ever had a gyro and I still consider it the best so far. Don't let the outside fool you! Yes it looks ghetto and Yes there's a janky bodega next to it, but the food is amazing, and its ran by a family that's really friendly.

Been coming here a long.. long time. If you want a general idea of what your walking into.. think a hippy subway haha! Everyone's laid back, the food is great and there are nothing but good vibes man, that's slang for great atmosphere haha. But if you cant decide on which sandwich you want you can ask if you can blend the two. I personally like the white widow and the Jamaican red.. so I get the Jamaican widow, best of both worlds!

This is the place you go when your looking for a band tee or poster or stickers or hats or anything else you can possibly think of that you might need to buy your band stuff on haha. In all seriousness this place has everything for the person that doesn't want the same cookie cutter bs clothes in the mall. I love this place, In all honesty I've bought my shirts here for the past 3-4 years...only here. If your looking for anything dark, rockabilly, goth..ish, different.. then this is the place for you. They also have baby and toddler sized stuff too to rock your kid out hahaha!

If this place were closer to my side of town it would be my usual spot. I'm a sucker for pubs, and this place has it going on.  So you like a chill spot... boom they got it So you like cheap drinks.. boom they got it So you like friendly people... boom they got it  The only thing that I saw that could be complained about... the bathrooms lol. Seriously dive/irish pub bars are known for really REALLY drunk people (not saying that what I saw here, just saying in general) and those stairs up to the bathroom and down to come back have to have had at least a small army of boozers piled at the bottom at one time... those things just look like a bad time is about to happen. But other than that Its a great place exactly what you would expect from a irish pub.. and I might be in love

There's a lot to like here wether you like old metal bands (metal head) on sunday, modern day music outside, and a dance floor upstairs out back. Music wise Its got something for everyone... the entrance bar area is dark and close, the outside patio is spacious and nice, and the shakeroom.. is just that to shake it in

I've been here at least 5 times and I'm always satisfied.   Its put together differently inside.. half grocery store half restaurant, but its cool and different than the conventional lobby of a restaurant. And truth be told actually makes you more likely to talk with other people while your there, something that's been missing these days.   So the food is made fresh to order, and with that some things take more time than others to get.. but isn't that a good problem to have? The only actual problem I see is that when someone comes in super excited with really big hopes because Defalco's has such a great rating they tend to get disappointed by the little things that usually wouldn't disappoint them... because their expecting the best food ever.. but its not the best ever. Now dont get me wrong I can literally eat there every day and always be happy and stuffed, but your always gonna have a better pasta at a pasta place or pizza at a pizza place. Its that thing that hurts... their blessing can be a curse

Yeah went here on a whim to go drinking.. about 5-6 of us. Waited in line for 10 minutes and finally got to the the front of the line, of course they let in the 2 girls in the group then tell us to wait while. For the next 25 minutes they let in other "in" people ahead of the line while were still waiting to get in with our friends. After the FOURTH group of people were allowed in ahead of us and trying to talk to the dbag bouncer we left. Never even got in... later found out the place was empty inside while we were waiting outside for no reason... this place is a complete waste of time and money.. go next door to Cue Club

Love this place! They have 3 different fenced in areas to take your dog, usually theres big dogs in one area and smaller ones in another. Everytime I've gone there are always friendly people and kids playing with some of the dogs too haha. There are dog fountains outside of the park, and is actually maintained pretty well! Theres plenty of room to play fetch and even little obstacle course type area in the back parts

Ok I've been here about 10 times and I've never had a bad time! Yes it may be small, for now until they expand (which is in the works), but that actually helps the place with social interaction. The staff is really friendly, they always have specials on drinks, and the sushi is amazing. I personally get a pocket rocket.. sweet and spicy and the iggy pop..  which actually has pop rocks in it! On sundays they have a live DJ and you can get a pbr bomber for $3.. thats a pbr and saki. So super cheap, great atmosphere, nice people, great food.. what else do you need?

These place is turning into my usual night spot. Besides the fact that there's no cover, or that they play old rock, and 90's stuff or that they have good looking girls behind the bar. Its got a really good feel to it.. like a dive bar meets the fancy popped collar part of scottsdale.. and lets be honest, its a breath of fresh air really. Who whats to be fancy all the time anyways!?

After searching the internet for a crossfit gym that wasn't ridiculously expensive I stumbled across Fit City Crossfit  that's only $75 a month.. HOLY crap! That's like half the price of everything I've found! So I contacted Matt (the coach) and signed up.  Now I've been going here 3 times a week for about a month now and to tell you the truth, I couldn't be happier! Matt keeps on you to do your best, the people there are actually nice and help keep you motivated, and I feel amazing! Another thing is the place looks small, that's because it is, and its not a bad thing by any means. Actually I think it helps it, by making it a smaller class so you get  critiqued on your form and if your fatiguing, to push a little bit more. Also it makes you come out of your shell and talk with other people working out because of your close proximity, which for me I never really did because I was focused on getting my workout in and getting out. Also having someone close to ask what certain parts of the WOD are helps, so I'm not doing it wrong haha

Always good! I've been here so many times I cant count.. obviously their doing something right! The place is super cheap, great food (fresh cut fries literally done in front of you), super fast service, and the people behind the counter are always in a good mood... like always. Love this place, if you get a chance eat here... you'll thank me later

Ok this place is hit and miss. No cover, but then there are the Scottsdale dbags. The music and the atmosphere are good, but if your trying to get a drink when its busy good luck! Literally tried to get the bartenders attention for 25 minutes.. yelling, waving hands, singing out loud. Ha thats fine I have no problem spending my money somewhere else

This place is actually really cool! Something you usually have to pay for anywhere else (the vacuum) you get for free and you're not obligated to buy anything at all. Also the way the business layout is there are 2 vacuum hoses to each station, which makes is SO much easier to clean your car/truck. No fighting a hose over the top of the car or through the seats to get a hard to reach spot. Now I haven't gotten a car wash here...yet, simply because my car is a pos haha. BUT when I get my car fixed I will be leaving another review, but till then this place is pretty awesome!

I've never been to this place when its poppin. Its 3 story and the top is outside so thats cool, but still nothing special. The one thing I can say is they have these drink pouring things.. but theres no pouring that happens... they pop it down on these...nozzles? I guess and fills the cup... but its really cool

Ok so the bar is on the patio of the second floor of a hotel.. bad ass looking pool, bad ass looking view, yada, yada.. where were the waitresses?  So we were part of the Mardi Gras pub crawl in downtown over the weekend and yeah everyone was drunk... including me. But being drunk having a good time and noticing a few things should say something right?  I'm not sure but being my first time here it was damn cold! But I cant really complain because it was an outside patio thats the name of the game. Ok well were the hell were the waitresses? Seriously we were there for at least an hour and had to fight for a place at the bar anytime we wanted a drink...  F that noise. Call me crazy but I dont want to have to get up from my couch area (that I just prewarmed with my ass because it was cold out) and wait at the bar for 20 minutes to get an overpriced drink (that I'll probably finish by the time I get back) to walk back and either find my spot taken or freezing cold again... *sigh* damn it... but this is also my first time... I have to visit this place again before I make a definitive F that decision

Make sure you're receipt says what you ordered.. They trend to ring up your order after your at the window and sometimes do it wrong

3 years...3 years I've used this business and I can't think of a single thing to complain about... Seriously.   Every year around mid to late January 6-7 of us go snowboarding in Telluride... and if your looking for numbers thats 6-7 of us at 330 a pop... you get a bus ride up (get to watch movies), bus ride back (you get a free lunch), 3 day ski pass, and a room/ extended living condo type room btw. When 1 day passes, In Telluride mind you,  run around $100 a day!? This is a steal! The trip captain's are always very informative, always friendly, and funny... sometimes haha! Hey they try!  They also have trips to snowbowl, sunrise, and other areas.. O yeah and Chile... YEAH Chile in South America. These guys are everywhere and as far as I've seen the best bet for deals and safe travel to have a great weekend

Well right off the bat the place looks really cool, low walls at the entrance so it already feels like your in the bar, good music, some awesome artwork, and huge TV's everywhere. The problem I have is when you pay $19 for 2 vodka redbulls, which by the way WTF I could by my own bottle of vodka for that, I wouldn't expect my feet to be stuck to the floor... literally almost lost my shoes 3 times. How is it opening week/weekend and the place seemed just dirty?  That makes no sense. Well regardless of the good stuff, I couldn't justify paying another $20 for 2 more drinks while loosing my shoes so we left after about a half hour. In all honesty the place has great potential but with prices like that your only attracting a certain type of people...  Scottsdale dbags.

So I haven't had bulwark for very long, but since having bulwark (3 month) my spider and scorpion problem have dramatically decreased. Hopefully the way it's looking, by summer we won't have as bad an issue as last year...thank god! My tech Tyler and bulwark have really helped our problem, it's still early but at this rate I'll be keeping them for a long time. Thank you!
