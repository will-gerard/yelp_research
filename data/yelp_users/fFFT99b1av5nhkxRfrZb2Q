Worst restaurant experience ever..!! I would give no stars if I can..  Four stars on Yelp, so who wouldn't give it a try right..?!?! So my girlfriends and I chose this place for our happy hour gig. And so this is how it went. 3 friends first got to the place at 430ish and it was already almost packed at the bar area where the happy hour is only allowed. The 3 girls tried to scout the area where we could sit and enjoy but to no luck because the bar area is a first come first serve basis. They informed the receptionist and were offered that we can stay at the regular dining area but can only stay til 630..because they have reservation...(trying not to write down the girls' reactions to this). 10 girls all together for happy hour and only 2 hours to chat, that's not possible and to be told to have a time limit to eat at a well known restaurant..?!?!? So the receptionists offered to call the manager to settle and accommodate us who never came after 30mins. At this time, most of us already were in the restaurant and eager to sit and start. We were offered again to stay at the regular dining area but can only stay til 730..hmmm..we really wanted to try the place so we gave in, 3 hours will at least be enough..One of us stayed at the front area and insisted on talking to the manager while the rest of us were ushered to our table...all the way to the very far corner of the room..and the entire room is EMPTY..!!! And they have told us the tables are all reserved. We tried to take some deep breaths and still be optimistic with our day. Our friend who insisted on talking with the manager came back and told us of their conversation. She only stated to the manager that we have never heard of such comments (stated above) from restaurants staff ever before and this is what the manager whose name is Ivars Melbardis had told her: "We are already giving you a courtesy by giving you a table at the regular dining area."   Really...?!?! We were all in shock!! We have never experienced anything like it. After hearing that shocking rude comment, we immediately decided to leave the place even though we've already been seated. We were in disbelief on how they treated paying customers like us and to say like we owe them for coming in to their restaurant. Such an arrogant manager!   I know this might be a very rare occasion but there's no excuse to treat customers like that. It is very rude and inappropriate. I hope this never happens to those who wanna try this place or any other place in that matter. My friends and I just want this incident to be out there for awareness.

My husband was having some Mexican cravings one night, and as we always try to do to try a new place, we decided to try Los Sombreros which is only a few miles from home. As we pulled in the parking lot, we were surprised how packed the lot is so we thought this was a good choice. At the reception area, we got greeted and seated right away. Service is quite good as glasses with water and menu were handed as we take our seats. A basket of freshly made chips with mild salsa was served as we take time finding a good meal to choose. As we scan the two-page menu, we found the selection to be minimal and somewhat overpriced with only a few items costing to at least less than $10 and the rest within the range of $10-20. The chips and salsa were good enough that we asked for another serving without knowing that this will be charged, it was actually on the menu that per refill costs. Not a good thing I guess. We decided on Simmered pork in a pumpkinseed tomatillo mole sauce, presentation is nice but nothing really special as we take bites of it. It's an entree that comes with choices of refried beans, black beans, rice or vegetables and tortilla. The only thing that made my husband happy with the meal was the hot salsa that really made him sweat like he has never sweat before from eating hot salsa!   Overall, the experience didn't leave us happy and will not try to come back here again though I would rate the ambiance and decor high as it is inviting and homey.

This is (another) all-time favorite! And to prove that, we go here at least every other week or when cravings call for it, we go every week!! Crazy huh? The hubbie and I and another couple who are great friends of ours usually spend at least 2-3 hours here, every trip, that's how much we love visiting this place! The owner and the servers know us...that when they see us come in, they start making our made-to-order favorite dishes and the hubbie's at least 2 small bowls of hoisin sauce..:) and from time to time they give us discounts for our entire meal! Sweet!! :) we have brought in friends and families from out of town and they also loved the place! Our all time dim sum faves are bean curd, hakaw, shrimp with veggies, siomai, fried small fish and my ever favorite, sticky rice!!! :-) for dessert, we love the sesame balls, both the yellow and black ones, and the Spanish coconut bread...Service I should say has always been good, we've also been given gift certificates on one occasion when they made a mistake with our bill. Price is very good for $2.75 per dim sum! All in all, I would truly ever recommend this place, food, affordability and service wise! And like one of the yelpers had said, you see a lot of Chinese people here, only means it's pretty good! Yummy!!! :-)  Oh and if you go and check out the place, you might wanna make one of the female servers give you a big smile by saying "She she Mei li" after each time they put something down on your table...They like that coz it means, 'Thank you beautiful', in English...:-)

This has become a favorite breakfast place of our little hiking group and my very good friend after yoga..=)  US Egg has always been our number one choice to have good breakfast especially after a good workout when your body just needs more fuel for energy. This place has always people waiting outside for tables because it's always packed..which is a good sign especially for first timers that the food most especially is worth waiting for..=)  My good friend and I, more often than not, always get our breakfast fix here with the good old American pancakes, well protein ones for my friend, crisp bacons, eggs, crispy hash brown as we like it, coffee and tea, or occasionally some corned beef hash. We also like their most recent addition, the Cornhuskers, consisting of two pancakes, two toasted bread, 2 eggs, 4 bacons, which is big enough for two people! =) Price is great for the amount of food you shell out for..This is our little spot after working out in the morning and we will never get tired of going here. So happy that we have this locally owned restaurant that serves good food! =)

Happy hour here is great!   I've been here a few times with friends and the hubbie. We love their happy hour, though not much selection but your cravings will be certainly satisfied with what they have to offer. =) It's a small place but can house a pretty good amount of patrons. Ambiance is very nice, specially for a quiet dinner with your loved ones. Service is fast enough. I never had a bad experience on all the occasions I've been here, we even made friends with one of the servers. I particularly like the taro chips, veggie roll, calamari cocktail and sunomono. These are all personal favorites but I guess the hubbie share the same..heehee =) Pricing is very fair especially for happy hour. I've also recently discovered that they now have Boba drinks which are priced very reasonably and have flavors that I've never tried before! I will surely try this one next time I stop by for HH.. I totally recommend this place, it's a very neat and quiet restaurant tucked in a good complex where you can also do grocery and shopping, all in one stop! =)

I love Mexican food and love this place! =)   This was my first time visiting the restaurant after discussing where to eat, our fiend finally suggested this one and so we went..It was quite a drive from the east side of town but we were not disappointed. The place looks very inviting that it reminded me of the movie Mask of Zorro and A Walk in the Clouds where they have those mansions with yellow paint with wall murals and nice potteries, it made me smile right away. It just feels homey. Service is fast and good, a basket full of chips and small bowl of salsa were immediately served as you sit down. Our server that night was very helpful, accommodating and very nice. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada dinner which is not your usual enchilada from other places. This one is served with rice and beans and the enchilada is done like a pancake, never had this before but it was sooo good! I ended bringing the rest of it home. The hubbie was craving for a some sort of bean dip so we got a side of the bean sauce they have..And boy! This was more than yummie!! Really delicious!! We finished the whole platter!! heehee Pricing is also very affordable with the big serving you get.  This place is worth the drive! =)

This is one of my big favorites in the valley! Have been here a lot of times and will not get tired of coming back! =)  Refreshing and organic food, lovely ambiance...=) We fell in love with this place after our very first trip in their location in Biltmore. There was quite a wait but it was well worth it. If you are looking for a new refreshing taste with choices for vegan and gluten allergic people, this is the place to be! The concept does not stay away from making their food delicious while using the freshest and most organic ingredients. I love bragging this place both to our local and out-of-towner friends. I've tried a variety of what they have to offer in the menu but my favorites are the Tuscan Kale and Chicken Chopped Salad, all types of pizza esp the one with goat cheese and the spaghetti squash casserole which is very light and healthy! For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is just amazing! =) Service is fast and efficient. Pricing is fair plus they offer half order to some of the selection in the menu.   Great place for lunch and dinner! Will have to try their breakfast menu soon! =)

I've never been to Scotland but I was told that this place or yet type of food is sort of Scottish. So let's see.  Yummie food!! Been here a few times with the hubbie, friends for happy hour and birthday.   There are 2 locations of this place in the valley and my favorite one is the one in Guadalupe Rd. As you walk in, it seems like you went back in 1800. Place is very warm with black and white paint as their primary colors. There are long tables with long white candles with melted wax still attached on the side that makes it very old yet beautiful. They use church pews as part of the long tables making the furniture very unique. Service is good and fast. They will take time to explain to you if you're first timers. Menu has a fair amount of selection according to their signature to the most popular pasties, they even have a full page of selection for vegans! Pasties are like calzone in a way or empanada in some countries, where you have meat stuffed inside a flour based dough. And they can out whatever kind of flavor they wanna put it! My favorites are the pesto chicken and chicken alfredo pasties! I also love, love, love the oven baked chips which are basically potatoes cut in wedges, baked to perfection and sprinkled with garlic or some jalapenos for those who are looking for some kick..You will not go wrong with these chips! My hubbie loves their Guinness which he says is very different from other restaurants, which I would say is true coz he has tried all kinds of this from all different places. They also have a good amount of beers that originated from Europe.  Pricing is fair enough for the big servings they give. I usually come home with half of my pasty so that's really big serving! =)  I recommend this place if you're looking for something new and fresh without shelling out too much $$..

"Yogurtland" as I say it with a high-pitched tone in the end..  This is my ultimate favorite dessert!! I would give 10 stars if Yelp allows it! All my friends know that I am attached to this place! We started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball game...and all I said after first walking in was, "This is fun!!" and we got hooked eversince!! That I collect their spoons, only used by me and the hubbie, and I now have 5 YGL  cups full of spoons!! I am the ultimate Yogurtland addict!! heehee We go as often as 5 times a week that we already know the staff in this location. And we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for Lent just to see if we can resist it!! haha Most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my YGL addiction..and so far nothing has won over it yet..=D So, my favorite flavors are Taro, Pistachio and Toasted Coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors, Pumpkin Pie, Gingerbread..Oh I wanna go now just thinking about it! My favorite toppings are the yogurt chips, sugar cone, sunflower seeds, shredded coconut and graham!!  =) Perfect blend of flavors!   So if you haven't tried it yet, grab your favorite partner and enjoy some "Yogurtland"...=)

I'm so glad I found this clinic to have our little puppy spayed. Everyone was wonderful! =) Let me start with the staff, from the person who answers the phone who was Frank, was very friendly and accommodating which makes you feel welcome. The receptionist who check us in was very professional, knowledgeable, friendly as she greeted us and with all the take-home advice once the procedure is done and when you're ready to bring your little furry friend. The clinic is very warm and clean with an area where you can stay and have some refreshments while waiting. Dr. Diskin is very nice, warm and reassured me that everything is gonna be fine. I left my puppy with a feeling that yes, everything will be alright. Few hours passed by, picked up my foggy puppy from the anesthesia and everything was ready for us, e-collar, take home meds, reminder sheet and some advices that I will be needing when my puppy starts her recovery period. And after 2 weeks, everything was perfect! The incision site healed well, no complications and my little baby was back to normal 24 hours post-surgery!! Thank you everyone from PAWS for taking care of my baby and for doing a great job! =)  Oh, they also were very accommodating in processing requests as they've made an error with the spaying certificate and the correct one was emailed to me in less than 24hours. They also checked with us a day after of the procedure to see how our puppy was doing. What a great follow-up protocol they have. We appreciate everything you've done for us. Saved us some money, great service and quality care! =)
