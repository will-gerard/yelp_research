had the bulkogi mini plate. very cheap at $5, but it's not really bulkogi - more like a thin steak with very sweet barbecue sauce - and the rice was too sticky. the lone bright spot of the meal was probably the potato-mac salad.

ugh. had the mediterranean omelet. eggs were so overcooked they even looked rubbery, not to mention the taste. the artichokes were hard. the feta cheese was dry. flavors were odd. the only appetizing was the toast, and they don't make that in house.

it's all about the two-fer and it's the only buffet i can go to without feeling guilty afterward... even with dessert - soft serve frozen yogurt! =D

I don't get it. Feels americanized. Really only liked the salsa, but even that could have been a lot spicier.

i don't see how this place is much better than some other fast food establishments. i'd rather go to in n n out.

had the bean burro. can't really mess up beans, but their hot sauce is too tomato-ey and not spicy enough.

house-turned bar. it's dark and cozy inside - perfect for whiling away a wintry night with friends.  happy hour specials are great. i had the $3 beer of the day - not just your typical domestic or import brew either. it was the ska pinstripe red ale from durango, co. tasted like a bitter fat tire. not my favorite, but i like the atypical experience. a few of my friends ordered the $4 bar snack, which was more like a bar meal - smoked turkey, prosciutto, and mozzarella panini, and gave rave reviews. they also had a $5 white wine and $6 red wine on special. the staff were well-informed and super nice.  all in all, i never expected to find such a charming place in downtown phoenix... and while i wouldn't drive all the way from east valley just for the experience, if i'm ever in the neighborhood, i'd stop in.

yuck. had to send a piece of sushi back because of a bug and should've known then to stop eating. tummy didn't feel so good the rest of the night.

the broth was too sweet for me. perhaps just personal taste though.

the food is fine. my cantonese friends claim it's quite authentic actually, but the service sucks. hostesses and waitresses both quite rude and i'd rather take my money elsewhere.

Good food. Service is a bit slow and its a bit dark inside, but amazing lentil and spinach salad. Kale and beet salad also good. Only let down was the burger and the falafel fries which were overcooked.

Nice spices: especially love the carrots, kale, and broccoli. Good portions. Friendly service. Would definitely go back.
