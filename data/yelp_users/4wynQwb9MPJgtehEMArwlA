The food was decent. But I was very disappointed when a member of the staff ran into my wife in the bathroom and made an unnecessary comment about her being in the bathroom.  I can only assume it's a lack of education or tolerance that would make someone so that to another human! Bottom line steer clear if you are gay or transgendered!

Stop reading reviews and just call Lynn!!! We had the hottest upstairs in Arizona! Our old unit kept freezing because it was overworking! Being a cheap person and not wanting to spend the money or have someone come tell me I needed to spend a million $ on a condo I don't intend to live in for very long...I spent hours looking for the right person and called George Brazil (BIG mistake) . .. But I'm so glad I call Cool Guys:D  Lynn was on time and so nice! He answered the million questions I had and totally understood I didn't want to spend a mint and even said I didn't need to (pretty much unheard of in 2011)  So less than 2 hours, $200 and my upstairs a/c unit is working better than it EVER has!!  Thank you so much!! When we move Cool Guys is definitely our company now and EVERYONE I know will be calling him!

I am not impressed. I got the mushroom burger and I guess I should have assumed the "smash" part meant that they would squish the patty ... But that takes most of the flavor out! O I was excited for fried pickles but they were really greasy and gross!   Also it was damn cold in there... I'll stick with 5 guys

My niece and her baby girl were in town and she eats at Upper Crust in Nm.  I was not impressed; the waiter took our order via text which basically meant no personality just a person looking at his cell phone.  He also repeatedly put our HOT dishes within reach of the baby in a high chair putting her at risk to be burned.  He was not personable at all!!  However the food was decent; not fantastic and for the price plus the annoying lack of personality and experience I'd rather not go back.  Also why have high chairs but no kids menu? we paid for an entire order of noodles with butter ( about 5 noodles eaten by the baby); I just think for a "family style" serving restaurant they should be more family friendly.  In an age where everyone is on their cell phone and disconnected most families go out to dinner to have an experience.  This was just another disconnected moment in our lives and should have been an easy relaxing time to catch up with our family.
