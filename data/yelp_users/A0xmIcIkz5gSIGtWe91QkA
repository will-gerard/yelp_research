Best Chinese food in arizona :)   I recommend the lettuce wraps to start.   Our favorite entrees 9/10:  spicy cinnamon shrimp: simple amazing flavor which I've never imagined could be achieved.   9/10: vindoloom curry, which a wonderful sweet and spicy pair of Indian and Chinese flavor.   8/10: chicken Pad thia - great veggies and large noodles   Michael was a great delight, respectful and swift :)

Prepare to have your taste buds delighted and comforted by a menu made with love and service inspired to please you and your family.   Right as we entered the owner greeted us with a smile and the kind suggestion of a few entrees which sounded amazing. The Monte Cristo and chorizo and green chili wrap were delicious.  The Monte Cristo was wonderful, grilled to maintain a even balance of crisp egg and bread along with fresh melted cheese and ham. So soft and delicious to the last bite.  I would strongly recommend this place because of it's loving environment and heathy options made with high quality ingredients.

After being seated respectfully in the dinning room I asked the host if she could inquire on the patio bar for open tables for happy hour.  It was full, but to my suprise the waiter "Robert" volunteered to hold a table for us, on his own time.  Wow! I was flattered at his generosity considering that never happens.   (If you're new to RF you're learn quickly the happy hour is delightful, both for delicious food and cheap, but fantastic drinks)  Our party of five enjoyed the flat bread, tortilla soup, beet salad, and date salad for starters.  Accompanied by huckleberry margaritas and huckleberry lemonade.  Everything was wonderful. My favorite was the date salad.    Diner I had the duck which was the best duck I've had in my life.  Highly recommended.  Robert our server was also very entertaining with his straight up attitude :) it was very fun and I will Def be back.  I've been here at least 12+ times :)

Four Peaks has always done a great job providing above-average bar food and wonderful beers.   I recommend the nachos for a party of 3 to 4 with chicken very affordable and delicious.   They make a wonderful Kilt lifter Scotch ale and 8 Street ale.

Every time I been in here I felt like it's full of super fratty college kids who are all drunk beyond there means.   They do offer very very cheap drink specials if you are into that. So that being said it's definitely offering a product but I think a lot of the locals really enjoy however I would say it's not the ideal place to go for a casual drink.

Over the past year we've visited Kohinoor over a dozen times for the dinner and lunch buffet. I will say the entrees when fresh can be very tasty however it's somewhat hit or miss. I do enjoy the large variety of options including veggie & white rice. 4 different options of chutney are very good although I've not understood the proper way to eat them all (in good time I'll learn, I hope). Chicken tikka masala, chicken masala, tapioca, roasted okra, sweet onion chn, meatballs and so much more. I'd recommend getting the buffet coupon which (I assume, but haven't quite understood) enables a couple to have the buffet and 2 fountain drinks for about $20 after tax and tip.   I'd recommend it if you're in the area, but I would drive far to experience it.

After going here for a long time we revisit it recently and was surprised to see how the owners were mistreating their employees. We noticed very aggressive and Loud yelling about very minor mistakes made by the employees and have now decided never to return to this restaurant.

I really do enjoy the food here all the ingredients tastes very fresh and it's never that busy. So it makes it easy to stop by for a quick lunch that's price for a modestly and expected to be quick in the service to be good.  And how they recommend checking it out and getting falafel or any of the Mediterranean salads. Also stop by the grocery store nearby and try some new ingredients or dishes that you haven't before. I don't think you'll be mistaken :-)

After trying pizzas in NY, Chicago, SF spinatos is the best pizza in the country. Da Greek, Nicoles new favorite, and super 6 are the best I've had.  I highly recommend trying the spaghetti calzone sm size and Wrigley sandwich :) everything is pretty amazing.  after 5 years I've still not found a better pizza place.  Also Maria, one of the staff is a true sweetheart.  She's honest, happy and a breath of sweet family everytime I see her :)  if you're there on Tues you'll have the pleasure of seeing her!

The House of Tricks has done a wonderful job creating a beautiful environment you're sick tree covered garden space surrounding their beautiful venue nested in historical Tempe Downtown. The food is delicious yet I don't find them taking very many risks in pursuing a more persuasive or passionate types of food. I would love to come back and always tell people great things about this place.  I recommend your friends and family or after work functions even for events :)

I had a bad experience here because there was a large piece of glass in my cup and I had told the manager and my server both of which did nothing after about 20 minutes I kept telling him it was an issue and they finally brought their attention to see if they could help me with my situation. I could have choked in this piece of glass and that could have caused a really big problem. The food is pretty good however due to the fact that the service was so negligent impassive I don't think I'll ever come back.

Some of the best gumbo I've had.  Very quick service both times I've been there.  Beautiful dinning area aside a gorgeous bar/ lounge.  The grill offers some delicious steaks and smoked fish. The samon and bbq are my favorite.    Highly recommended :)

Olivios Grill doesn't really care about the quality of their ingredients however they do offer a very affordable variety of Mediterranean food.  Every time I come here I never really feel like the service cares whether or not I'm there however the consistency is decent. They could do a better job of cleaning up the dining area and also trying to act like they care that their customers want to be there.

Whenever I come to Thai Basil I feel like the staff are very happy and welcoming they suit you nicely and are very attentive to your needs.  The food is also very consistent I really like the panang curry or the green or yellow curry. The pa thai is also pretty good.   recommend for family and friends

This is my favorite froyo in the country!  I'd recommend coming here at least twice a month to experience the creators handmade recipes which are always fresh and new.  Every season he creates a new concept for sweet, savory, bizarre, rich, and more.   Highly recommend for all ages and tastes!

I have been trying to get help and feedback from this agent and he almost never returns emails with any detail.  disregards questions and has not followed through with any requests. I have to constantly reach out hoping that I have get my policy issues fixed.  it's a bummer, don't work with this agent.

Wonderfuk seafood, except the scalopes which are filled with sand, which make your teeth feel gritty afterwards.    I recommend an Oscar preperation of the surf and turf.   The calamari has a tasty spice derived from thai peppers and sweet sauce.   Recommend happyhour to save, dinner is good for a special occasion, however the bar appears to be more fun with the live jazz.

I love the samon omelet here. The menu is full of great flavor and health focused options.  The oreo pancakes are a very tasty option for those with a sweet tooth.  Can't wait to return with my family next year when we visit.   Service is pretty terrible, but i try to forget about it.

After we're welconed by a very friendly host we were served two tasty bowls with gyro meat.  I ventured through all the toppings and tried every single one :) So fresh and healthy I would highly recommend this place for heath focused foodies :)

We had lunch here and the following items are as follows.   6/10 cran slam: dry meat, low flavor, small portion of cran, very nice bread, iceberg lettuce brings no flavor but a small crunch.  8/10 meatball: your basic meatball sub. Doesn't standout.   I would not recommend this place if you know how to make a sandwich. Save the time and money and do it yourself.  This place shouldn't be allowed to claim "best sandwich". Theres nothing I recall other than simple sandwichea and poor service.

I would like to give a big thanks to this company! They did a great job making our group of 10 feel comfortable and happy the whole night.  I was in Vegas for a buddies Bachelor party and this was the highlight of the trip by far!  I would highly recommend this to anyone that would like to see a lot of great venues and sights.  Our night took us from the north end to the south end of the strip.  Also the price is great, you're not going to find a better deal!    Thanks again YourLasVegasGuide!!! Best time ever!

I came here with my girlfriend and two other friends for her birthday and we tried the green chili pork sliders pretzels with cheese dip in the pulled pork beer cheese fries. We also tried a 5 beer sampler, the coffee Stout and a few others turned out to be some of the better beers we've ever had. This place is Simply Amazing I can't stress enough how great the food is and the beer is just as wonderful. I highly recommend.   Also they have beautiful video and pictures from round Arizona my only recommendation would be that they would put titles on all of them so we know where these beautiful destinations are.

Panda Express, extremely convenient, hardly healthy but delicious American Chinese food, brought to you by an american corporation near you :-)  So this location is across the street from my place and I must say it is delicious but extremely unhealthy. The portions are large, the pricing is competitive, and the space is very clean/ well-maintained I've never felt that the service is anything but decent. Recommended for fast eats, casual minded guest.  Also their cup sizes are hysterical check out my photo!

Over the past few years I've known the property manager at DeVan MGT and have nothing but great things to say.  Their properties are in great shape, the tenants have always seemed happy from what I can tell and they seem to really care about their renters.   I've always felt that they provide a service that is friendly, economical, reliable and honest.   If you're in the market for renting or need some help with MGT I would recommend contacting these guys. They're currently helping me with my property and I'm excited to continue our relationship.

Postino's has done a great job offering very reasonable wine and bruschetta deals. They also offer a wonderful happy hour beer pitcher which is about half the size of a normal picture for $5.  There a large patio and beautiful interior is filled with mid-century and old style furniture. I really appreciate this because this style seems to be growing strong in the Phoenix Valley, with these new trendy Design forword venues embodying the asthetic it really makes your time spent here fun and enjoyable.

Pita Jungle has always been one of my favorite healthy choices. They have consistently created unique Southwestern Mediterranean Fusion dishes which of always invited fresh and healthy ingredients with a very modest price.  Although this location doesn't lend itself to the traditional Pita Jungle vibe its very fun and well designed. I do think the old location of Apache was much better.   I highly recommend the chicken Del Sol, any of the flatbread pizzas as well as the chicken shawarma or Gyro wrap.  Probably one of my favorite restaurants have ever been to my life.

We dined in here yesterday evening to celebrate a birthday with family and friends.  The cocktails are delicious their approach to making and refining certain flavors is very strong. We tried two different drinks that resembled a citrus and more of a cool flowering mojito, I tried walking on the sun which definitely had a nice tone of heat, I could go without the egg white. We tried several of the small plates including the calamari which was a favorite probably the best of all the items we tried. We also tried the Chandler Street Tacos, the Baja mi tacos, the cheese plate, potato skins and the pork belly skewers. Everything was delicious.   Our favorite was definitely the Baja mi tacos and calamari. I would recommend it but keep in mind the prices are expensive approximately 10 to 12 for a cocktail and small plates ranging from 10 to 15 with only enough to get a strong taste of the dish.
