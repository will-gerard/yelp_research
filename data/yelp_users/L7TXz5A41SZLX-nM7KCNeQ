Not impressed. Dropped a tablecloth for a work event off here and was told would take two weeks because of the size.  Seems a bit long but this is the first time I've left a non-clothing item anywhere so, ok.  Called day before expected date of completion to confirm and was told it would be ready at 5pm and I said I'd be by the next am.  I roll in and it's not done!  Pointing fingers and asking who I spoke to?  Didn't think to ask unless I was told it wasn't going to be ready.  Woman was apologetic. Writing this review in the parking lot while they press it. It was just going to be washed in cold water, hung to dry and pressed. No cost taken off the $30.

Pediatricians do not meet and greet or interview...   I am pregnant with my first child so as most hospitals tell you in all your preparation classes, "Interview Pediatricians." My OB's office is in the same center as Mesa Pediatrics so I stopped in to ask some routine questions such as is the office accepting new patients and do they accept my health insurance and do they have access to the hospital I will be delivering at. In addition I also wanted to see about making an appointment to meet / interview any of their doctors at this location.   According to the gal at the front desk, none of the doctors at this location do interviews or meet and greets. She told me I could view their profiles on their website. That doesn't really provide a feel for the doctor other than what they can do or have done - doesn't show the type of bedside manner or even if you will like them. Being in the hospital with a newborn and a first time mom is not the time I would like to find out that I hate my child's doctor.   I was told I could go to their Tempe location and interview the doctors there but none of the Tempe doctors work at this location. So how does that help me to choose a doctor at the location I was at and she said that it really didn't.   She did mention that other people have left their pediatricians to go to their office but not being able to meet with them to see why, that isn't enough for me to choose them as my doctor's office for my child.   Then she said that I could ask around and see what other people thought of this location but of course they can't provide a list of people who go to their offices. Why even mention that??? What was the point of that?   I was so frustrated by that conversation.   If you are currently interviewing pediatricians, you can cross this one off of your list of phone calls and drop-ins since the doctors will not meet with anyone who is not a current patient.   I did ask a few of my friends who do have children about my experience and they did tell me this is unusual or they have not heard of this happening.   So if the doctor that I do wind up taking my child to doesn't work out, I'll interview with other pediatricians before I even think about taking my child here.

We attended the 4-course beer pairing and I highly recommend it.  The service was amazing and fast.  The pairing experience lasted about 2 hours and you are seating with other diners at a table that seats 16 people so you have an opportunity to really interact with the other diners which for us made the experience more fun.  If you are not a social butterfly this type of dining experience may not be for you. During the pairing the beer representative made his rounds explaining what we were drinking and the history behind the beer and how it is made.  The chef also made his rounds after each course was served to give us the ingredients and techniques used.  Overall a great experience, plenty of service and we didn't have to do anything.  The only things that could have been a little different was the lighting was very dim so reading about our experience or reviewing the catalogs that were on the table was difficult and it was at times difficult to hear what was being said over the restaurant and other patron noise.

Although scheduling an appointment for an ultrasound was very easy and the follow-up from this staff was wonderful, the review is more on my actual appointment and service I received during my ultrasound. The ultrasound tech was not like any other ultrasound tech I have encountered before. I needed a pelvic ultrasound and he wound up asking me after he had done the traditional ultrasound if I needed or if my doctor wanted me to have a different type of ultrasound.   I had to use the bathroom after the first ultrasound before the second ultrasound be performed. There was no bathroom in Suite 103 where I was having my ultrasound. So I was instructed to go to the other Simon med suite in 102 to use the bathroom. When I returned the ultrasound tech had prepped the table for me in advance and gave me clear instructions as to what he needed me to do and then notified me that he would be obtaining a chaperone.  He seemed very, very uncomfortable having to do the internal ultrasound and made me handle the wand and business end first at that with no offer to sanitize or anything to clean all the gel off my hand and honestly the situation caught me off guard. Luckily I had clean and sanitized hands!   Finally, something else I found odd was that once he was finished he instructed me to of course get dressed but then I had to throw things away off the table. I just felt that this is a medical professional and my past ultrasound (I've had a lot) were more professional. Anyone else ever have an experience like this?

I was so lucky to have met Bree at I believe it was Woofstock or Barktoberfest in Gilbert a few years ago.  My dogs Bindy and Hank LOVED her!  They knew they were in for fun when she would pick them up and were tired when they came home.  Thank goodness for them after I had my daughter because as a new mother I was swamped and working from home I really had no time.  When we would go out of town, I knew that the furry kids were safe, happy and I always had a note when I came home of what they did, etc.  I even received the occasional photo text of what they were up to. Unfortunately we had to move to N. Phoenix and they are not covering that are (yet?) but hopefully one day they will expand their service area.  I really find it hard to trust anyone else with my furry babies but they do miss them! Trustworthy, communicative, flexible, honest and very affordable.  I highly recommend their services.
