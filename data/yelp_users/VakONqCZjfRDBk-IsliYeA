I use this place all the time. I purchased the freaky clean package and use it 1-2 times / week to keep my car clean.   No complaints here

great value and a great sandwich!  don't order a large sandwich unless you're really really hungry. their sandwiches are HUGE!

highly marginal most of the food was cold and flavorless. the cornbread was like eating sawdust  however the sauce was pretty good

SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PLACE!!!  went there on Xmas place was empty and this should have been a clue!!  food was cold and many pans were empty. i made one trip to the buffet and took one bite of each dish and from the look on my girlfriends face i could see that she was going to try to make this work. At that point i decided it was time to leave.   I spoke to the cashier, told her that i was unhappy with the food that was out and she tried to negotiate with me. I told her that this was unacceptable and that i wanted my money back and she only wanted to give me half of my money back. i just wanted to leave and go somewhere else so I agreed.  like i said at the beginning move on, I would could  have rated zero stars if i could have
