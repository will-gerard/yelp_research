Was told an hour wait for my tow. Ended up being about two hours. No one has the courtesy to give you a call about a delay or anything. So when I called I was told they are 15 minutes away. So 25 minutes later I called again to be told the same thing yet again. So finally at 2 hours I get a call from the tow guy "alex" asking where I am. My response was stuck on the east side parking lot. (Which was disclosed in the initial call) so I was told by Alex I can't see you but I am here. I said ok me to and disconnect the call. Alex finally gets to my car and ask me did the call drop or I hang up. Told him I hung up. Then he got aggressive and approached me calling me "bro" and asking me why I hung up and got in my face. Definitely not a professional situation, nor clever being that we live in a 2nd amendment happy state. So beware of the ghetto, thug driver they have Alex

I got my pup Reena as a rescue. She was 4 months old and severely traumatized from being attacked by a rattlesnake so walking her on the leash anywhere was a challenge to do she was afraid of everything after the few sessions with all American K 9 she was a whole new dog still has the fear of new random foreign objects but I no longer need to leash her or take any effort walking my dog. It does not matter if there are other animals cats people or anything she stays focused and on point this was the best dog training I have ever experienced and I told anyone I come across with a dog that is still trained not fully trained or has issues of any sort to check him out give him a try if I can guarantee your dog will be amazing when it's done. Then the real fun begins.  Thanks a bunch!
