Amazing staff, friendly people, great facility! What's not too like?   Well the only negative about his club is that the swimming lap pool isn't on the same level as the gym. It's small and not always clean, a lot of leave and fogy water on some days.

Not the place to take your cat. I swear my cat was traumatized. And her hind end looks horribly cut.   It was loud and chaotic. They were an hour later than they said they would be in returning my cat.  I believe my cat got a respiratory infection after being there.  I had taken her to the vet immediately prior and my cat was fine.  I have no other pets and severe OCD so it seems almost impossible she had the infection from my place.  Which leads me to believe she had gotten it sometime at the groomers while she was there, from 11:00am-2:00pm.   As far as dogs go maybe a good place, but I don't know.    I do know....  NEVER BRING YOUR CAT HERE!!!!

Love the environment and the owner Paula is the sweetest thing!  This has a great collection of books and I'm glad it's around.  It may seem unorganized by appearance but that'd quite the opposite. It is organized like a classic librarian (having worked at a library before).  It's easy to find books that you need and I have no complaints.    However if you are allergic to cats be warned this is a cat friendly environment.  Also if you have spare tuna give it to the cat because that girl looks hungry.

Amazing apartments for their price! Nice, quiet and great staff! Mary is very welcoming and a wonderful person.  It's a good secluded area for those who need a bit of a getaway from the city :) but not too far away.

Quick easy friendly cheap windshield repair.  Very nice service, punctual and they phone called me to make sure I remembered my appointment. I really appreciate that since I tend to be forgetful.   The only complaint was how loud the tv was in the waiting room. Other than that great place I'm bookmarking this.

Food: Amazing, absolutely delicious.  My favorite is the New York roll and the Teriyaki tofu.  Service: horrible. it's not in a timely manner.  Once I ordered my usual, thai boba with teriyaki tofu... they brought out my food really late, I waited over a half hour and there wasn't many people there. Also... THEY FORGOT THE TOFU! they brought my plate to me with just rice and greens but no tofu.... HOW DOES SOMEONE FORGET A DETAIL LIKE THAT?   the service is horrible.... but the food is worth it.

This is my favorite place to eat!  Super healthy super friendly staff! One time the messed up my order and over compensated with free smoothies for my group.  However there is a blonde gal that works here and she definitely isn't the brightest bulb.  She messed up orders twice that I was there and continuously had a blank stare that not only were her brains missing but some childhood experience. All the other staff members are amazing though. Just avoid this blonde girl....  The food tastes amazing! And I really appreciate that they accommodate my food allergies!! And have a wide variety of healthy choices. I also love that they are open at late hours, allows people like me to keep a healthy diet even at night.  Couldn't ask for a better hang out spot.

Terrible service. If you plan on getting timely service this is not the bar for you.   However, the environment and food are excellent for groups.  Came here to get on my March Madness and just left with Madness
