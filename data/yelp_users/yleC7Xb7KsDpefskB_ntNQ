Look elsewhere.   This guy is not someone you want to to deal with.  I actually feel kind of sorry for him.  Kind of. Take my advice.  Avoid.

What's NOT to love?  The largest collection of winning Indy cars other than at the brickyard's own museum.  The building itself is very cool too.   Oh yeah, did I mention that it's free??!!

I could not have been less impressed with the hostile and unprofessional attitude of everyone I encountered at Hastings and Hastings.   Learn from my mistake and don't bother calling these people.

Hey Hastings and Hastings--  Here's your update.  The rude, hostile, snotty girl who answers your phone told me I had no case and absolutely refused to let me speak with an attorney.    Phillips and Lyon just got us an accident settlement offer of almost $15,000.

Meh.  I was craving pie and driving from Flagstaff to Phoenix so we went Into Rock Springs.   We walked in and were left standing for about 15 minutes near the "wait to be seated" sign. That's where you should stand if you want to be completely ignored and feel very unwelcome.   Finally, I said "How do I get some pie?"  I was ordered away from that area by a very hostile woman who clearly didn't want anything to do with a pie only order.    They were not busy and the whole process to get a piece of pie in a plastic slice box took nearly 30 minutes.   It was absurdly small, barely over 1/2 inch thick.

I am impressed!  Huge, delicious burgers, bargain priced.   They have a nice menu with a variety of burgers and good looking hot dogs too.  I had a  double cheese burger. It was flame grilled and besides being big and juicy, had a nice smoky taste.  The fries were hot, crisp and nicely seasoned.   After eating his 3/4 lb TRIPLE cheeseburger, my teen son had to have some ice cream.  For just over a buck, he got a generous soft serve cone with that crunch coat stuff that I haven't seen since I was a kid.  The place was very clean and the staff were all polite, helpful and friendly.  I foolishly drove by Lenny's for years, thinking it might not be so good.    Don't make my mistake!  I loved Lenny's and can't wait to go back.

It's PF Changs cheaper cousin and I actually like it much better.  I've never been a fan of Changs.  Even after running the R&R marathon and getting various coupons and deals, which had us eating there several times, I never bonded at all.  Not so at Pei Wei.    I like their food, it's hot and fresh, there is a nice selection to choose from, and the value is there.

Great cleaners.   Fair prices and I've never had anything lost or damaged.  The man owner is cool, the lady has never once been the slightest bit friendly, at all.  Ever.  I'm not there for friendship though, They are fast, reasonable and do their job very well.

Papago really is a great place.  Dozens of tap handles, hundreds of beers in the cooler and a basic but quite good menu.  The ONLY thing keeping that 5th star away, is that the place has a dirty feel.    Not old or modest or even run down from years of use, like a dive bar,  but like sanitation is not of the utmost importance.    Too many sticky /  fingeprinted / splattered looking things for 5 stars.

Good solid burrito joint food.  It seems much cleaner and better run than most -berto places. You won't be overwhelmed with the hugeness of your burrito but it's (somewhat) made up for in quality.   Good value, nice owner. delicious food.

Bob's is just the kind of place we need more of.    It's a small, old fashioned shop that is fair and fast.  There is nothing slick, or corporate about this place.   It's a bike shop, nothing more, which is exactly as I like it.

A REAL hardware store.  They really do have EVERYTHING here .  My only issue is the prices on some things can be high, really high  - like double or more.   I understand paying a premium for good service and good selection but don't get carried away on the prices

I'm going to give Skeptical Chymist 2 stars to average out my recent 4 star visit and my 2 recent 2 star ones.   I really want to like Skeptical.  They have everything I like:  Their food is very good and well priced. They have excellent specials and a huge and thoughtful craft beer menu. Plus, it's just a cool, local one of a kind place.  What's the problem?  Hostility.  It's a coin toss as to how you'll be treated.  I've been there probably 10 times.  One time it's great, and next time you're treated like an unwelcome intruder.  Last night was the latter.    The waitress clearly did not want to be there.  She conveyed agitation from the first moment she approached our table.  She mumbled, slouched and shuffled.    We expressed an interest in the Red Hook Beers on special.  She gestured toward a poster on the wall, clearly intending that we get up, go read the poster and not trouble her by asking her to verbalize what Red Hook beers they have.    She left, we walked over to read the poster and ordered our selections.   "We're out of all Red Hook beers" she then informs us.    She impatiently demands our "plan B" beer selection.  My wife was reading the beer menu.  The waitress asks me what beer I want.   I said " I'm waiting my turn to see the list"   She let out a sigh of contempt and just walked away.  Monday is $5 Cheeseburgers, which is a fantastic deal.  My son ordered one. As I ordered mine, she barked over me as I spoke:  "I'll have to charge you for the water"  What?   "I'm going to charge you for water"    Why are you going to charge for a glass of water?   "Because you have to order a drink for that deal and he (gesturing toward my son) only has water."  What a very charming diplomat you are, miss.  He'll have a Coke, thank you so much for asking.  The food was good but again the waitress just had this impatient "I hate everyone" attitude the whole time.    Later we asked "Can we order more beer before happy hour ends?  She just says "Yes" and keeps walking.    We looked at the board, read the menu and carefully select which beers we wanted.   She shows up with 2 glasses of what we had ordered at first.    I said "What are these?"    "Your beers"    "We didn't order our second beers yet"  "These are what you ordered before"  "We didn't want those again, we wanted something different"  "Oh" ...and left them anyway, sighed (again) and walked away.   End of discussion.  No "sorry" No "What did you want?"  No anything,  just "Oh" as in "I will put that on my list of things about which I do not care"  Interestingly, she disappeared 3/4 of the way though the service and someone else took over.  Expect good food, and a theoretically good beer selection but do not expect good service because this is not the first time the level-of-service-coin toss landed tails up..

My review only is for the Northside Bar that is ironically in the SOUTHEWEST corner of the store.   Gotta love a grocery store with 35 taps and $10 pizzas (on Thursdays)!  Fantastic beer selection with an emphasis on locals.  I'd like to see more beer culture and special events (like at the Chandler WF!)    Happy hour is a bit stingy but the Thursday growler fill special is a great deal.  And no, it's not as odd as it sounds to relax and enjoy a pint in a grocery store.

Good, authentic "back-east" pies!  Update: I thought this last time but it hapened again:  Service is just weird. Both times we had waitresses that were just kind of oddly awkward about everything.   I was going to give NYPD 3 stars, but since your delivery driver was driving like a total ass and cut me off while we were driving there, you lost one more.

At his request, I messaged "Richard S: through Yelp and also e-mailed him directly so I could better describe our visits.    I never got any response whatsoever.  So, here's the message:  "Richard S", If you don't want to hear the details of customers' experiences, you should not ask people to spend their time contacting you.  PS.  Yes, I took away one more star.

The food was good and I liked the place, but if you walk out from your meal feeling angry, it's hard to give any more than one star.   We had a Living Social deal. I guess they wish they hadn't sold them because when I got my check there was a "$4.00 service charge". When I asked about it, I was told that they impose what amounts to a 40% tax on the deal "otherwise we don't make any money"  That is not disclosed anywhere so I'm disclosing it here.

I've been coming to Pulse for a few months now. I waited to review it until I was sure my initial impressions were accurate.   I've joined various gyms through the years and tried out different "boot camp" deals I've come across.    This is the first place to which I feel I "belong".  I'm not only impressed with the professionalism of the staff but, I just like the other members too.    It's not a "meathead" gym nor is it one of those mega places where you're pretty much on your own and invisible.   The staff knows their stuff and seem to genuinely care about your fitness and well being.   They are valuable resources of exercise, physical therapy and nutrition advice.  Other places I've tried left me with the impression that the bootcamp trainers were making it up as they went or just winging it.  I often felt that things were kind of sloppy and rather than thinking "that was a good workout" I felt injured or strained.    Here at Pulse, I've definitely worked myself but never felt like things were out of control or overdone.    I love that according to Yelp, I've checked in here 48 times and I don't think we've ever repeated a single workout.     (and, I wasn't in really BAD shape but have lost 12 lb of fat and gained 8 lb of muscle)

I was very pleasantly surprised as I walked in.  It was a hot, bright sunny summer afternoon and what a nice contrast was provided.  This place was dark and cool (my wife said she was freezing, but she always is) and it reminded me of a 100 year old bar in San Francisco.  Think dark wood, red velvet drapes, chandeliers and upholstered furniture.  The menu is small but inspired.  The portions are small but the prices very reasonable.    The drinks were quite creative with exotic ingredients, but at about $12 each, they should be something special.    Why just 2 stars??    The service was just insanely slow.    EVERYTHING took FOR-EV-ER.   When we were seated, another couple was nearby.  They said, "get comfortable, you will be here for a really long time"     We ordered 2 drinks and 2 simple appetizers.  My drink took about 15 minutes.  My wife's drink followed about 10 minutes later.  The 2 sliders and a tiny flatbread took close to an hour from when we ordered.  We ordered another round of drinks about one hour into our stay.    Meanwhile, the other couple was waiting and waiting and waiting to pay.  They had been there over 2 hours but did not want to be, that's just how long it took.   Finally, they went and got a menu,  calculated their own bill, added the estimated tax and just left a pile of cash asking us to explain it in the unlikely event the server ever returned.  She came around and after waiting 45 minutes for the second drinks that never came, I just handed her my cash and said  "I'm leaving".    We were there over 2 hours and half of our stuff never even arrived.   That is the thing I can stand the least: leaving a restaurant feeling angry at the waste of your time, the contempt shown for your enjoyment and wondering why a night of your life was wasted hoping for some server to grace you with their glance.     We went home, warmed up some leftovers and made our own drinks.

It's as good as it gets.   His price was less than half of what the dealer wanted for my transponder key and was substantially less than any other local locksmith.  Plus he came out quickly, met me at a convenient place and got the job done quickly.   It couldn't have gone better.

Bank of America is my bank of over 20 years and I can't stand them.  We have a hate/hate relationship.  As a long time Bank of America customer I thought...  I.  Hated. Banks.     I discovered that Chase (across Bell road) is everything B of A isn't.   Chase employees are sincerely friendly and actually look for a way to help you rather than B of A staffers who look for a way to get out of helping you.   If you need a manager for anything Chase finds a way to accomodate you rather than BA where they hide behind a big policy book that says the answer to every question is always a cold, disinterested  "No"  A perfect example is making a deposit- B of A gets all pissy if you don't write our your full address and phone number on a deposit slip (stupid waste of time!!)  Chase doesn't even ask for one, they do it for you!  Bank of America got rid of their drive through - Chase has one.  Bank of America closes much earlier each day than Chase too    I thought I hated all banks but I realize B of A just is just crappy.

I usually go for lunch so that's what my review reflects.  I love it, awesome selection and everything is really good.   Not necessarily fantastic, but really good with a nice variety.  In any review, price is a factor.   Normally price costs stars, because it's not hard to find good food if you pay a lot for it.   In this case, they gain the 5th star because it's an exceptional value for what you pay,

SUCH a cool place.   I feel that my words are not really adequate to describe it.   Is it a bar? A gym? A store? A restaurant? A warehouse?    Yes, and no. It's all of those things in a place that obviously defies description.   If you want a Schlitz while doing hula hoop. They got you covered.   An excellent mojito along with a game of indoor corn-hole?  Yup.   A Mason jar of pot pie, a used bicycle and to hit a punching bag after karaoke?    But of course.   What is this place?  I don't know, but I love it.

What a great little store.  Little in square footage, and well hidden away, but I love it!  Helpful staff who knows their stuff; Really friendly and knowledgebale and were really committed to finding just the right shoe for my running gait and budget.    I never felt like I was being sold or having anything pushed on me.    I've only been running for a little over a year, but I do my best to send everyone I know here.    I am totally impressed.

Really, really weak beer selection. Inexcusably so.   It's like they signed up for the 3 taps the Budweiser salesman was pushing and that's it.     Sad.  And lazy.      I really wish I could like this place but other than being really close to my house, I can't.  There is so much they could do to improve it's appeal but they seem to want to pinch pennies to save a dime rather than seeing the big picture to make dollars.   Follow up:  Read through the other reviews.  Notice how many people say they wish they could like it better, how they want it to succeed, that it seems lost and without any identity?    Owners: Your potential customers are cheering for you, get with it before it's too late.

First impression, the place looked really nice.  It smelled authentically Chinese too.  But ultimately it's about the food and that's why it gets 2 stars.  Small portions, high prices and frankly, weak food with poor service are a bad combo.  The Kung Pao was unlike any I've had before.  Hard, small, dry, fried bits of chicken with some peanuts and a half pound of dried red peppers with no sauce and no veggies was somethng I'd not like to have again.    The black bean chicken, had no veggies and the sauce was thick and gelatinous; almost slimy.  In fact it was so gelatinous, after a few minutes it actually acquired the semi-solid jiggle of actual Jello.  It should be called corn starch chicken, not black bean chicken.  The service was uncomfortable and odd.  It was a farily dead Sunday afternoon,  yet the bartender dropped and broke three items at 3 different times while we were there.  Someone, a manager looking guy, was yelling from the kitchen to the bar (all the tables are located in between there) asking who had his Sharpie.   My daughter asked if she could substitute plain noodles for rice with her kids meal and the waiter just said "No."   Then later he mumbled some comment about "everything being pre-portioned"  Pre-portioned?  Is this just microwave food?  A Chinese place that doesn't have any "unpackaged" noodles??  At $55 for 2 chicken entrees,  2 dinky kids meals and 2 iced teas with nothing else, I was robbed!  Then my biggest pet peeve- the 20 minute disappearing act after they cleared our plates and we confirmed we didn't want anything else. Meanwhile the waiter walked around looking busy and doing nothing while avoiding eye contact and not giving us our check.   Honestly, It just made me crave some superior Chinese fare, along the likes of Panda Express.   Pei Wei and Changs? You can laugh this challenge off.

Their entrepreneurial kamikazi mission was successful.  The plan of no website, no advertising whatsoever, an unpronouncable and unspellable name and a rude bunch of punks running the place succeeded as expected.  Out of business.  Why would someone spend money opening a place and then seemingly intentionally drive it out of business?

It is what it is.  It's not a bar, or a night club.  It's a big brewery with a tasting room.   And as that, it's perfect.  It's in an industrial warehouse setting, with an interior view overlooking the production equipment.  The place is about parking your butt for a while, sampling their brews and getting a chance to try new stuff that is hard to find elsewhere while cooling off and munching some pretzels.        They do offer grilled sandwiches which are remarkably good and an excellent value at $5-6 each.  I try to stop in everytime I'm in the area and I think you should too!

I DON'T CARE (if it's 500 calories) I LOVE IT!  This place is great and is a fantastic value.    $2 for a made to order Ice cream sandwich on your choice of really good cookies and whatever ice cream you want??    For $2???    Insanity.   They also have $3.50 shakes that look fantastic!

Nice people, good food and  a great beer selection.  The waitress was great, and we really all enjoyed our sandwiches.    But then again,  I had damn well better enjoy them at $13 each!! If you "upgrade" your side, you've got a $15 burger.    AND, after I ordered (during happy hour BTW) I found out our beers were SEVEN DOLLARS EACH.  $22 for a meal consisting of a cheeseburger and a beer?     Think about it -- 4 people could walk out dropping $100 for cheeseburgers, after tax and tip.    That's just crazy.  Yes, the food was good but value is part of the equation and on that, CBCB fails.

I really like OHSO!  I love the huge and locally focused beer selection, I love the bike theme, I love the the way they embrace the canal, (coolest fence EVER!!) I love the dog friendliness and I love the food!  With all of this love, why 4, and not 5, stars?   The service is kind of rough.  I've been there 3 times and there is a frazzled attitude, bordering on hostile.  Maybe I've just had bad luck but this is based on 3 visits.  In the interest of fairness, I'll keep trying until they get it right though  ;-)

I do love the sort of industrial/warehouse look of the space.    Nice beer list, but the waiter copped an almost surly attitude when we asked of they had any local beers.  "No, we have CRAFT beer not local beer"    Well, excuse me sir.  The place was nearly dead, there were a few people at the bar.  In the dining room was only our party and one other.  There were two servers.  Despite a nearly one to one table to server ratio everything took FOREVER.    My daughter joked they must have driven to a farm somewhere to get the lettuce and began milking the goat for the feta cheese after we ordered it.  There was no excuse.  Well , maybe there was one.    I was seated against the west wall where I could see into the kitchen.  The two servers seemed mostly interested in playing grab-ass and dancing around and laughing in the kitchen while our drinks were empty and no one was able to check on anything.- ever.   Here's the deal breaker- I was served probably the worst burger ever.  I ordered it medium.  Medium means a little pink in the middle and still juicy.    The one I got was about 3 levels past well-done.  It was a cinder.   Black, hard, dried out to the point that it had actually curled up and was somewhat dish shaped.  It was horribly bitter and yet, not even hot. If it had been cooked any more, it might have caught on fire.  It was as if if had been burned earlier in the day and they fished it from the trash can to pass it off to me.  I finally was able to get the waiters attention and told him.  He took my whole plate away and after nearly the rest of my party was completely done, I got a replacement burger served with the same thirty minute old french fries I had been served long before, of course they were now cold and limp.  I fail to see the point of surly service and remarkably bad food at relatively high prices.  Fail.

-The pizza was good, very good actually.  -Outstanding beer selection, bordering on amazing.  -The service? Not so much.  We walked in.  There were 4 of us.  The hostess/teenager boy at the hostess stand had this confused look on his face, semingly unable to comprehend why there would be 4 people looking at him near the "Please wait to be seated" sign   After several odd moments you could practically see the bolt of lightning strike him.   "Oh!" he exclaimed, "Would you like to be seated?!?"  It was a slow Wednesday night, after Happy Hour and the place was pretty dead.  Everything else went fairly well right up until near the end.  Then the waiter seemed to lose interest in us once we were almost done and not ordering more.    He had to be stared at to bring a box for the pizza.  I also asked for the check since we were clearly done and had been done for a long while.   Then he slowly cleared the table.  "Can you get us the check?" I asked again.      Then he came by and asked if we wanted our water filled or dessert.   "We want to leave. Please get our check" He brought it, and I immediately held out my credit card hoping he wouldn't escape.  He bolted. Finally, I stood up and got in his way and handed it to him as he tried to slip by.  Meanwhile, he flat out disappeared.    My wife was walking around the mostly empty restaurant looking at the decorations.  My kids were standing up, unable to sit any longer. I was just sitting, giving him the stink eye as he did just about everything except bring back our check.  He saw this scene but walked over to chat up the bartender girl and some other guy.  Finally I had to walk into their conversation and say "give me that" referring to the check and my credit card in his hand.  He never said a word and just gave it to me and walked away.   UPDATE:   I visited again.   It was another dose of the same thing.   We had eaten half of our pizza and were clearly all done.   The waiter came over.  "Can I get you anything else?" I said "No,  we're all done, just a box and the check please"  What did he do?  He walked over to chit chat with the bartender girl, and then drifted over to hang out with another waitress, he just leaned his ass against the counter (The counter with a huge stack of pizza boxes!!!) and then got all excited when he got another table seated.   He tended to them, took their drink orders and brought their drinks and only then got around to bringing us the box that he was asked for 15 minutes before.   My review had been 2 stars and since the same exact thing happened again, I took one more away.

Every damn time. It's always something.   That advertise 1/2 off ALL drinks during happy hour.   There is no asterisk, no fine print.  All means all    We ordered 2 Funkwerks beers.  Guess what?  Secret Surprise!  Funkwerks excluded.  That was not disclosed on the placard, or the beer list nor by the waitress.   Too bad because (in her words) "That's just how it is"  I hate myself for coming back here.

I was really excited to finally go to Handlebar.   I love beer, I love bicycles and I like bar food!    We went tonight; a hot, humid summer monsoon evening.  They keep all the doors and windows open but as nice as that sounds, that means that it will also be hot and humid inside.  I grew up in Arizona, and run long distances so I'm used to heat.  I was wet with sweat after about 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, I order my $6.50 beer and sadly discover they pour 12 oz draft beers, not pints like ummm, pretty much every other place there is.    So, for prices that are about 33% too high, you get 3/4 of a beer.  I wasn't going to do that again so I switch gears.   It's Tito's Vodka night.  There's a rep from Tito's giving samples. She mentions that Tito's Vodka drinks are $4.    Which ones? "All drinks with Tito's vodka", she says.  "Cool, we'll order some" I say.  She is so proud of me, she gives me a T-shirt.   Our waitress comes by, and asks for our 2nd round order.   "We'll have some of the $4 Tito's drinks".  We ask which ones are on special.  She too says "All drinks with Tito's Vodka are $4"   She's nice and we chit chat and discuss the drinks shown on the Tito's placard on the table. We ask for suggestions, she motions to the placard and says "All of those are really good,  especially for $4"  I order a " vodka sonic" (soda/tonic) , my wife gets the vodka martini (which the waitress, the table placard, and the Tito's Vodka rep all said was $4)  We get the bill.  My drink was $4 and the ,martini was $6.    We ask about the discrepancy.    She says "Yes, the Vodka part of the martini was $4 but the rest of it was $2 more"    "What do you mean 'The rest of it was $2', You told us at least three times the Tito's drinks were $4"  "RIGHT HERE (on the table) it says 'Tito's vodka martini; $4'"  "Yes, the vodka part is $4 but the martini part was $2 extra.  That totals $6"  Then why did you, and the Tito's person say it was $4?  "WELL, everyone knows a martini is extra"   I guess olives are $1 each.     P.S. The place kind of smelled like pee.   :)

Culvers is really good stuff.  Menu-wise, you can compare it to Sonic, except EVERYTHING here is MUCH better!  I love the burgers, the sides, and anything at all made with their frozen custard.   If you like cheese, DO NOT miss the cheese curds.  I'd give it 5 stars, but value factors into the equation and the bill at Culvers can really add up.

I've been here 3 times.   It's better than most take out pies.  It's strictly a take out place but they do have some outdoor tables that work out well, at least when the weather's nice   It's not "artisan" or anything especially fancy but it's better than most.  I like the rustic decor and the simple menu.  Why the low rating?  Based on my first visit, I had mentally given them 4 stars.    The last time I went, I wondered why the bill was so high.  I added up the prices from their website and knew what to expect.  The bill was several dollars more.   The teenager at the cash register explained that the owner decided to raise the prices but chose not to update the website.    Not cool.    He said "Yes, we have had a lot of complaints about that"  But of course, the new price is the price they are charging and if I didn't like it, I didn't have to take dinner home to all of the people sitting at home waiting for me to bring pizza. (-1 star)  That was a week ago.  Today, we ordered a large pizza.  (Their "facebook" special)   We expected their large pizza.   We got a small one.  Why?  Here, "large" is small and "giant" is "large"   Got it?    Don't order large and expect their big one; it's their small. (-1 more)  The pizza is pretty good and deserves about 3 or 3.5 stars, but I really don't like feeling short changed, especially not twice in a row.

I love Capriotti's. It really is the best sub chain around!  I like how you can taste the good quality, distinctive flavors of each ingerdient.   You can taste bread, and meat and cheese unlike say, Subway, where everything is just Subway flavor.

I love this place.  (but don't want to return!!)  Great people and a very friendly, caring environment.  They sincerely want to make you well.  I agitated my IT band in my leg when training for a race. Then since I couldn't run, I began bike riding. I wrecked and hurt my shoulder.   They worked on me and got me back in shape in time for my run.  I later found out that even my own doctor comes here!

Great pizza. I've been there 3 times since we discovered it 10 days ago.  The crust, the sauce and the toppings are all excellent and authentic. I love how the outer crust is perfectly crispy yet soft in the middle, perfect to fold; as god intended pizza to be eaten.

I have to give them a one based on my experience.  We ordered 2 decent sounding burgers and two drinks.  I offered him my still valid Groupon on its expiration day.  He said that meant that it had expired the day before.   I left. I contacted groupon.  They said I was right.  But the thief owner of Lucky's had redeemed it and marked it as used just as he was telling me it couldn't be used.   Classy. You stole $13 from me.    I'll laugh when you go out of business.
