I went in for a simple alignment because I had a little bit of shake around 70 mph on the freeway and a slight pull to the right. I'm driving a Volkswagen Passat with only 45,000 miles on it. 10 minutes after bringing my car in, the guy at the desk came out with a quote for $1535.47 because my struts and shocks were supposedly bad and causing cupping in my tires. An additional quote of $436.48 was offered for replacing the tires. Knowing Volkswagens well, the odds of struts and shocks going bad at only 45,000 miles is ridiculous. So, I went to a Volkswagen dealer and have them look at it and they confirmed that none of the things were wrong that Big O said were wrong. I also spoke to my private mechanic who confirmed that it would be near impossible for Volkswagen struts and shocks to be bad at this low of mileage. Big o tried to scam me out of nearly $2000. Obviously I will not be going back. Be cautious if you're brave enough to deal with them.

The lines are unbelievably long and there are only two tellers working. The manager is walking around with a clipboard and doing absolutely nothing useful and other workers are in the back. It's definitely time to switch banks.

I can be pretty picky about Indian food and have been disappointed by several places around the valley. This place, on the other hand, absolutely wowed me. The dinner buffet had an exceptional number of choices on both the meat side and the vegetarian side. The palak paneer was smooth and creamy and perfectly spiced. Same with the vegetable korma. The spices were well-balanced, very flavorful and an adventure for the tongue. There was just the right amount of heat, and as usual, I cooled it down a bit with a spoonful of raita, which was also delicious. There was Mango Lassie on the buffet, a great treat! My favorite dessert was there as well...gulab jamun. Try them! They are delicate balls of sweetness drifting in a wonderful syrup of cardamom and Rosewater. When we sat down with our first plate, our server brought us a sizzling plate of tandoori chicken which was fantastic. The host was friendly and checked on us several times to make sure we were happy and pleased with everything. There is a bar with a decent selection of liquors, although we had Taj Mahal beer that night. The decor was fun to look at. I can't find anything even mildly negative to say about this place. I'll be going back regularly.

ooooh, sweet baby, come to momma! the first dog i tried at Short Leash was the Lady: Chipotle Cream Cheese, sauteed onions, and fried pickles. at first bite, the song resounded in my mind: "Lady, when you're with me I'm smiling. Give me all your love. Your hands build me up when I'm sinking. Touch me and my troubles all fade," and i'm not even a Styx fan (sorry, not sorry). it's just *that* good.   but wait! listen, linda, lookit honey honey. you MUST try the Bear. with Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, Smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce, how can you go wrong?! you can't! just do it! i did it, and i'll do it again.

They have gluten-free buns, and their Burgers and chicken are all the Yums! You can get goat cheese on your burger, my favorite! I love their shoestring fries... They're not too soggy and not too overly crispy, just right!   They have four salads and they all sound good, but I'm not here to be *that* healthy.

Stacy Ann has mad skills! Absolutely the most vibrant, long-lasting colors for those who want the BOOM factor.  My hair doesn't hold color well and i didn't care so much when i was only doing "natural" colors like brown or strawberry blonde. When i wanted really really vibrant and intense colors, like pink or orange, however, i wanted color that would really HOLD and LAST. I just don't dig that drab, faded out pink-magenta i see around too often.   So, Stacy Ann pulled out the big guns and used Goldwell Elumen on my locks and i've lived happily every since! Seriously, i can go 4 months without a touch-up and still have vibrant color. (Not that i *like* to go 4 months, but sometimes that's just the way it goes /broke@ssbroke)  Stacy Ann asks a lot of questions so that she's very sure she understands what you want. If you don't know exactly what you want, she will help you unravel the mystery.   It's all about the love.

The ONLY reason I give PF 4 stars and not 5 is that there's no steam room. Maybe i'm stuck in the 70's but man do i love a steam room. That aside, I love PF for lots of reasons. There are TONS of cardio equipment (up bike, down bike...what, i don't know the correct terms, just stay with me...treads, ellipticals, stairs and these machines of horrid torture that make you look like a galloping antelope) so there's never a wait. There's a 30-minute ab area, a 30-minute circuit area, stretching machines, free weights, and lots of other muscle-strengthening/building/toning machines. All that for $10/month, and it's open 24/7. Superduper sweet deal! Best part? They have a rule about not showing off or being a loud meathead. They really want everyone to feel comfortable there, despite their fitness level (and mine is bordering on pathetic currently).   If you want a little pampering, for an additional $10/month, you can be a Black Card holder and have access to unlimited tanning beds (both standing and lying), hydro massage tables (oooooh yes yes yes) and massage chairs, but best of all....the "Beauty Angel," aka Total Body Enhancement. That's some weird business right there. Don't get me wrong; i love it and use it often, but if you really want to be freaked out, just get inside that thing and turn it on.   Don your tanning goggles, step inside the chamber, place your feet on the foot-shaped plate in the center of the floor, pull the door closed, and hit "start." A hypnotic female voice gently tells you that your "vibrashake" session will begin shortly. MAKE SURE YOU PEE FIRST before doing the Beauty Angel. Trust me.   Upon hitting the START button, brilliant red lights come on which help stimulate collagen production and help you stay looking young. But that's not the best or weirdest part. The "vibrashake" starts and you feel as if you're either about to launch into space, or be shaken into a mushy pile of boneless goo. Or both. It's a little scary and unsettling at first. Stay with it, though. Once the fear subsides, it actually becomes really relaxing. Whether or not it actually helps reduce cellulite, as it claims, it's so bizarre and fascinating that i just don't care.

This is the best place in the east valley to find vintage and antique items. With over 140 occupied booths, you'll find nice variety here. There are "man" themed booths, Victorian frills and lace, western flavored booths and lots of cool vintage kitchen ware. All kinds of win here!

Best mead in town, and not because it's the only mead in town. The green apple mead is crisp and slightly tart...pretty much perfect. My favorite, however, is the caramel. It's sweet, but not too sweet, just really well balanced and delicious.   The owner, Cody, is really friendly and personable and just fun to talk to. It's always exciting to see what new flavors he's brewing up.   Grub note: There's no food in house as of now, but you can bring your own or have some delivered.   If you're new to mead, go slowly. It's strong stuff and so delicious you'll be tempted to drink it fast and in great amounts. Remember, the Vikings drank it and they were pretty fierce, or so rumor has it. You are not a Viking. Have a DD or get a Lyft/Uber, cab or something to get you home safely.   Best news ever: you can buy bottles or growlers and party like a Viking at home. BOOM!

I went in with high hopes, because Neapolitan style pizza is my absolute favorite and the competitors do it extremely well here in the valley. I have to say, I was disappointed. The crust was too floury on the edges and it was soggy in the middle.   I also ordered the Italian chop salad and it was not great either. It was just "meh." I feel as though a $10 salad should be more flavorful and have more interesting elements.   The espresso gelato was good. It was the only thing I really liked there and would have again, but it's not worth the trip back just for that.
