I spend more time thinking about the meat from The Meat Shop than I am comfortable admitting.  I've been around the block with both the beef and pork products.  Thank you beef ribs and pork shoulder.

I am so in love with PHX Public Market -- I should marry it. Almost all of the produce makes me tingle. I've packed my grocery bag full of berries, spinach, green beans and more. All local, all tasty. It's important to note, some items are too pricey and some aren't perfectly fresh but you have to be selective and buy what makes sense. It is a fun place to pick up a few items you can't easily get elsewhere. Don't miss the wine selection in the back of the store. I am quickly making my way through the choices and am convinced I've been paying too much for CA wines. Rancho Rossa cab/merlot blend - a 2005 for $25?! Yes, please.  The market staff is always helpful and willing to offer suggestions. Grab some Crave ice cream then a coffee at  the conjoined Royal at the Market on the way out.

Blondie cookies. 'Nuf said.  Notable improvements each time I visit.  I am thrilled to find a spot serving Costa Rican coffee and Clover Organic dairy products.  The daily coffee options are not always presented on the menu but the team is happy to offer suggestions.  Don't be afraid to ask.  Service is not without bumps but once you try the brew, sweets and food, it is easy to overlook the shortcomings of Cartel.  I think they know that.  Some kids are justified to be too cool for school.

Correction!  The Grind is OPEN on Sunday! Our planets have yet to align.  I had every intention of giving it a try tonight so I searched Yelp to confirm the address and learned The Grind is closed on Sundays.  I thought that was odd but OK there's religion.  Incidentally, I drove by later that night and, by God, the place was open!  Maybe I'll say a prayer and see you another time, The Grind.  Looks like a nice dark spot for a Sunday night burger.

Zin, where Medium means Bloody Rare and soggy fries.   Service was fast and fair but what it really comes down to is the food and Zin isn't pulling it off.  $36 for one burger and two fries .... Nah, no thanks.   Slightly heart broken that the fries had no crunch.  I mean zero. Sigh. Points for outdoor seating and that's a seasonal pleasure cruise.  I won't try it again.

If Vitamin T is any indication of what's to come for the DT PHX dining scene, I think we're in good shape, kids.  Dropped in on T for a quick work-day lunch and had two tacos for $5.  The barbacoa is very flavorful and the pork has a perfect kick of spicy heat.  The tacos are small but they don't skimp on the ingredients and give you plenty of meat resulting in a great combo of flavors.  The space is small but they were efficient and moved quickly to serve meals.  The staff was friendly and they seem to pay attention bc my meal was handed to me and they didn't call my number.  I recommend grabbing food to go bc I am sure it gets very crowded over lunch time.  I hope to visit again and sit outside. Hooray for tasty outside dining options in DT.  Thanks Vitamin T, you make me feel healthy.  Sign up on their website for deals. http://eatmoretacos.com/

I attended a Me the Artist event which was hosted by a friend in her home.  I was skeptical at first given I have had very little exposure to the painting process but was soon at ease given the step by step instruction. Most of us were laughing at our lack of experience but were quickly impressed by our own "hidden talents"!  The instructor, Ruby, took her time to guide us through each step.  What a fun way to share a day, a few drinks and lots of laughs with friends. The painting is now hanging on my wall and my guests are surprised to learn that I DID THAT!
