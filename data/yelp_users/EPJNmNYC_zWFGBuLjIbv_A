I have been too this cheesecake factory twice now. Once to have..of course cheesecake, and the other to actually have dinner and a few drinks.   The first experience was great, waitress was there when we needed her and we received our cheesecake in a timely manor and of course was amazing.   The 2nd time there was very limited seating, we had ordered a appetizer and had taken our time with it, the table we were sitting at was big enough for if that, 2 plates. Our entrees had come and we were cramped for room, but as soon as a table opened up, the waiter was happy to seat us in a booth and move our food.   I had the Hibachi steak which was a perfect choice. Rare like i asked, and full of flavor.   overall, i am extremely happy with this place and hope not to have a bad experience!

Authentic Japanese atmosphere, make sure to check the wall for "secret" menu items! The Spam musubi and honey butter toast are to die for.

Beer battered fries are to die for. Best place to stop by and get a quick bite. It's best to go at "odd" times because parking is impossible.

Been here twice, love to stop buy and get some dinner. The environment is really nice and there's someone even there to play live piano!  The service is par but the place makes up with its food, absolutely love the BBQ Pork appetizers, one thing i can't shut up about is the tea, it is pure amazing. The next time I go, I definitely want to try out the lobster or duck, which is what they are known for from what I've heard.

WORTHLESS, so here is my awesome story that just start about 5 hours ago. My car was towed RIGHT OUT SIDE MY HOUSE, Where police have informed that it was towed because of a "vin violation" So this means that someone reported my car parked outside my house and the cops went and check it out, PHYISCALLY looked at my VIN number and said, hey this doesnt match, but little do their IGNORANT minds know, my dash was swapped because we all know a dash cannot last 5 years in the arizona heat, if they would have take 2 seconds to open my door which was unlocked with my window open, they could have check the VIN on the door and seal to find MAGICALLY that it matched the plate. So with their COP like authority, they towed my car, i have called them OVER 25 TIMES, getting NUMEROUS run around stories to finally track down the man i have to talk to to obtain my car, mr dan cook. I am a WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER, i need my car at ALL times, he has not called me back nor do i expect him to. The police have helped me zero in this situation. Its down right scary that these are the people "protecting" us

I've been coming here for almost 4 years now and I have watched this place run it self into the ground. I come here for the salmon which is awesome but the service is just plain terrible. The outside of the building is falling apart, the sign doesn't illuminate, and there is graffiti on the walls. Sorry but not sorry saketini, you've lost me as a loyal customer today as I watched my sushi sit on the counter for 10 minutes and never having my drinks refilled.

I had poked my head in once again because I just can't resist their salmon. The staff now wears uniforms and service is much better! Glad to see things are looking up a bit.

Been here a few times, had their boat, presentation was awesome and had plenty of food.  Been here for the sushi obviously, its a little spendy, but the location is really convenient, i have heard a few negative things about their sushi, but i always leave with a smile on my face afterwards.  The service is par as you would expect.   I'd give it a 3.8 if there was that rating, why, because of the price to service ratio, but i'll give it a 4 because i really enjoyed my sashimi last time.

My friend had taken me here, i have been to plenty of sushi bars and restaurants, but this one is special, this one is the best.   First off, the prices. They are unreal fair. When i looked at the tab, I actually said, that's not bad at all.   But more than that, the sushi is simply amazing, my unagi plate presentation was crazy, served on a sizzling plate, it defiantly had the whole restaurant staring. The crunchy tuna roll was fantastic along with the sashimi.  If you have friends that don't like sushi and have never tried it, take them here, it will make them think twice!

They say you get what you pay for, prices are fantastic, and food was surprisingly good, I live a block away and plan to continue going here for some quick sesame chicken!

I have had the lucky chance to stay at ALL of the city centers resorts. Aria, Mandarin, Vdara and finally the Cosmopolitan.  I will have to say, it is my favorite out of the bunch.  I had dinner at Scarpetta, a beautifully prepared 7 course meal and some amazing wine.   My room choice of the night for my stay was the Wrap Around Terrence suite. Located on the 38th floor, which I believe was the top of the tower on the west side of the strip. My photos speak for themselfs, I loved every second of being in that room.   But the real reason i love this place more than anything.. the price. Out of all the resorts surrounding the Cosmo, they have the best bang for your buck. I will now make this the only resort/hotel i stay at in Vegas!

I have now tried over 4 different all you can eat sushi places around Vegas and this one caught my eye with all the reviews.   The fish is fantastic and my Sushi Chef was the best all around guy we could have possibly had during our experience. Extremely humble and I asked him to make us all his favorite nigiri, hand rolls and rolls.   The seaweed salad is exceptionally good and is a MUST try.  The nigiri is very small compared to most places, but that doesn't matter as you can order as much as you can eat.

Service was fantastic, the sweet potato fries are to die for. They almost tasted like candy. Server recommended the "Hell's Kitchen Burger" which was the "basic" choice of burgers. It was sized very decently, temperature was perfect and my only complaint is I wish it already had ketchup on it, it tasted a bit "dry" without any condiments.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience.

I've been coming here for about a month damn near everyday now.  Best time to come is the lunch rush when everything is fresh. Chefs will make you hand rolls and sashimi per request.  Fish is great quality but the cuts of nigri are small to save cost.  Try and avoid all rolls with crab mix. This place is a real nigri heaven as most places are 8 bucks just for two pieces. Service is decent, I feel they are a little short staffed but they take care of you in a decent amount of time.
