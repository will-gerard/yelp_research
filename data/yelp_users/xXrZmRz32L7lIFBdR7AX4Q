3/5/11: we met some other families here for our first visit. Separate play area for under 2 years made it a lot easier for me to relax & enjoy watching my son play on his own & with other little ones. We will be back. :)

10/7/11: I really appreciate when people take time to help you understand what your options are. Second tire problem in one month so I wasn't too happy to be there. They repaired it, and I got tire protection for life of these tires :) No hype. Just good people doing work.   12/7/11: back again and glad I got the tire protection.

3/12/11: The staff in this Brighton store are hardly ever helpful.  About every 3 visits I have a good experience.  Today's salesperson prompted me to write this review.  Roberta didn't even bother to say hello and when I explained that I was there because I wanted to get my Brighton purse repaired, she was less than helpful.  First, she hemmed and hawed.  Then she asked if I had registered it.  Then she tells me that if I've had the purse more than 5 years, I have to pay for it to be repaired.  Since the conversation was quickly going nowhere, I left without leaving the purse for repair nor purchasing the items I intended to purchase.  I made it a point of telling her that I'd rather go to Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Now I'm telling everyone on yelp - don't bother to give them your business.  They don't take care of their long-term customers.  If you want to buy anything Brighton, see Jane at Scottsdale Fashion Square.

2/23/11: Karen helped me without being pushy - she did a great job of explaining how pants would wear so that I'd get the right size

2/25/11: Half size pollo con queso is perfect size. Fresh warm chips are served as soon as you are seated. Bonus - it's a Pepsi place :) Took off 1 star because it took a long time for them to bring bill/cash me out

Fun place! There for NFL game & regulars were friendly. Wings were good. Easy on prices. If it served Pepsi, it would be 5 stars. RC cola is okay though

2/23/11: I was looking for two old movies on DVD. The salesperson was able to order one, but not the other. He explained to me how I could find it since it's no longer available in stores. I appreciate that kind of customer service. :)

12/2/11: 10 minutes after I ordered my lunch, server returns to tell me my dish is very popular and it's going to be 20 minutes and hands me the menu. If my meal isn't here within 20 minutes, they will lose another star.... just not worth giving them 3 stars

Had a great meal on my first visit! Loved being on patio. My friend had been there before so he suggested artisan cheese plate for starter. It was awesome! He had pork belly tenderloin and I had macadamia nut crusted duck breast. Mine was good and his tasted even better! Naomi was the perfect server because she paid attention to what was happening at table. She never interrupted our conversation. Very much appreciate great service like that!! Only reason it's 4 star is because they serve Coca-Cola products. Our pictures of meal turned out too dark so you'll just have to go and order food to see how great it looks.

2/20/2011 - They were great today. My online order was wrong - they made another pizza, delivered it to my house, and took the wrong one to give to charity

4/4/11: I've been enjoying food from Flo's since 1998. I get takeout because it is loud in restaurant. Spring rolls are my favorite appetizers - I get two orders so I can eat one on way home. I like various dishes especially when they are willing to cook off menu (like chicken with snow peas).  Subtracted one star for noisy atmosphere

Was at my boyfriend's house and really just wanted some extra pampering. Decided that I was going to try one of those blow dry places. He suggested going here because he'd been here a few times for haircuts. Tasha was fantastic! She welcomed me as soon as I stepped into the shop. I have long hair & she did a great job!  She took time to put extra conditioner in my hair and chatted with me about life. All in all, a totally pleasant experience that I might do again soon. Two thumbs up! Thanks for a great experience

3/3/11: Tonight it was a takeout smorgasbord of goodies... New pork chops tasted great in restaurant & now in takeout too. Love Santa Fe rolls - next time I'm asking for two each of the sauces because then I don't have to worry about double-dipping accidentally at home. Same for requesting an extra sauce with pot stickers when I'm sharing a meal with someone  :) Tonight the takeout food is as good as in restaurant & it's a rare restaurant that can do that.

This location is family owned. Friendly service. Yummy food. I love that they have hazelnut coffee creamer for my coffee and serve Pepsi too. It's kid-friendly place because my toddler can wander a little bit & the staff is okay with talking with him as I return him to our table. We are semi-regulars here. I only return to places with good service & good food.

3/31/11: delicious pasta with butternut squash & brussel sprouts! Excellent service - I appreciate it when my server checks table without being obtrusive. And, it's a Pepsi place! :)

5/28/2014: every time I go to this store, I get great service. Tonight Matt Darling did an even better job. Wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my phone and data plans. He walked through all my options, answered questions, and never once pressed me to make a decision. Told him I wanted to get something to eat at Viet Kitchen & review numbers before making a decision. He gave me his card and responded to my texts while I was eating & reviewing my info. I appreciate that kind of customer service! Happy with what I decided to do!!

Awesome place to hangout! Breakfast yummy in my tummy sandwich is my favorite.  Servers are the right mix of friendly & efficient. Cool to offer coffee in morning and then alcohol in evening. Wish I lived within walking distance to make it my local place.  Drive-thru too!

Love their food and the service at this location is always awesome! Yes, it can get insanely busy. That's because the food is great. It is now a Pepsi place again (I love that!!) My favorites include boom dip and wings. It's also kid-friendly with good prices & quick food. One more thing: they give kids some dough to entertain them

I am giving them 5 stars in advance to show what I believe they can achieve. Why? Because I want this place to succeed! Counter service was fast & friendly today. Chocolate croissant was delicious. I've been here 3 times at different times of day. Night service was noticeably slower than breakfast or lunch. After a chat with server, I found out it's because she didn't want to intrude on our conversation. So at least intentions were good. Kitchen likely needs more experience to cook faster. It's all made to order too. And, more importantly, it's a local business that deserves encouragement. Plus, it serves Pepsi in glass bottle or fountain :)
