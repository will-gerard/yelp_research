Love this place - we go here all the time - the apple dessert is the best ever - it's now our favorite dessert - we usually get the mango salad & enchiladas with white sauce are yummy - highly recommend

I wasn't even given a chance - Lisa sounded nice through text - I had called her several times and she only responded back through text - she was going out of town so I would have to wait 2 weeks before getting my dogs hair cut - no biggy -she was suppose to show up Monday at 1:30 she text me at 1:30 saying she was running late - I thought ok - 2 hours later she text me her van wouldn't start - then offered nothing to make it right - I thought surly she would follow up - not a peep - headed back to my normal groomer - very disappointed

Sadly I wasn't impressed - good amount of salad yet stingy on the chicken - prices are higher than other places I've been to

This is such a great unique place - the food is awesome - we had the Reuben ( yummy ) & we had the chicken salad - everything was delicious & fresh - the banana pudding is amazing - the best we've ever tasted . A very welcoming environment - we will surly be back and hope others come check it out - because it is totally "worth takeaway "

We had reservations for the patio - we ordered happy hour appetizers and the portions were very small-we asked for more chips which they did not want to give us - the portions were so small for the price we paid - usually a 12$ salad is pretty filling - but not here - stingy on the chicken - not sure we will be back - felt like a waste of good money -
