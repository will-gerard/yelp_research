My go to place for my Mercedes.  Have had lots of work done from major repairs to oil changes.  Much cheaper than the dealer and they provide great service.  I've used the shuttle service often to get to and from work.  Awesome place.  Update.  Went in to fix a ESP/Break warning that popped up during the holidays.  German Auto said I needed to replace my battery.  Pretty simple fix with one issue- I just had my battery replaced from the dealer literally two week prior.  I stated this fact, but Eric insisted that they wouldn't do anything further until I replaced it.  I also shared that I needed to take my daughter back to California the next day.  German Auto wouldn't budge.  I had to still pay the diagnostic fee which was around $99.  I immediately drove to Mercedes Benz of Scottsdale which took the car in without an appointment, got me a loaner, and found the true source of the warning- a faulty wheel speed sensor.  It ended up costing me around $1200 which I would have gladly spent at German Auto, but their stubbornness prevented that from happening.  The techs at the dealer laughed when I mentioned I was told it was a battery issue.  Haven't had a battery issue since or had the warning pop up again.  I wont be returning to German Auto unfortunately.  I did enjoy their shuttle service and Bernie (awesome guy).   I wanted to save money like everyone else, but in the end the dealer gets it right the first time and sadly can't say that's happened at German Auto every time.  They are good until they are not.

I go here at least 1 a week with my wife.  I get the meatball Pho along with the BBQ pork Bahn Mi.  The food is great, cheap, and quick.  The staff is friendly, not in your typically way, but they do a good job.  Da Vang has become of my favorite places period in Phoenix.

Have been looking for a decent Ramen spot in AZ since Umami closed a few months back unfortunately and Fujiya serves this purpose albeit only on Saturdays.  For $6 the broth was flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  The hard boiled egg was tasty and had been marinated before hand.  Ramen is only served on Saturdays starting at 11:30 so get there early.  They only serve 30 bowls which is a shame, because it is one of the few serviceable ramen options in the state.  Seating is also limited as well.

Sad to say but the car wash has really gone down hill recently. My last two  experiences have been crappy.  My car wasn't cleaned properly on the last visit and this time when I pulled up I wasn't greeted and after a minute of waiting I had to get out of my car to approach 4 workers who were chatting.  I jokingly asked "are you closed?". I walked in after and asked for a manager Josh and found out he was one of the four unfortunately.  Not coming back again which is a shame because my wife and I have been coming for years.

This place has quickly become our favorite local chinese joint.  The food is quick and cheap.  Much better than most of the chinese places around the Glendale/West Phoenix area.  It's very nice and clean inside if you want to dine in.  Can't say that for other chinese places.

Awesome place, great Margaritas, most places don't know how to make them.  They have an awesome happy hour from 3-6.  The food was great.  My wife got the shrimp rilleno and it was awesome.  I got the carne asada steak.  I liked the beans and rice as well. The flavor is more true to authentic Mexican food.  Definitely will be coming back.
