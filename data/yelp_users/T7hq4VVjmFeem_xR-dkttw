I pre ordered the iPhone 6 and showed up after receiving an email stating I could stop by to pick it up any time that day. It was 7:30 and the line was out the door. I was told to come back tomorrow and that there's no way I was getting that phone prior to 9pm close. I've already paid for the phone and I showed them the email I'd received but to no avail. So I called the store on my way home explaining what'd happened and the kid looked up my name and said they shouldn't have had me wait in line and that I could come get it whenever. It turned my Friday night into a cluster and I'm disappointed in the way apple does business.  Seriously considering galaxy whatever and ditching the iPhone for good.

Went to breakfast this morning and there was no wait! Nestled in the heart of old town. Great spot for a great relaxing environment.
