I dined here for the very first time last night, so I can not comment on the consistency of the food or service, just my one time experience.  We were immediately greeted and seated when we arrived, and when the gentlemen found out that we had not been there before he told us all about the weekend experience with the belly dancing, and hookah. He also told us to make reservations for the weekends, cause they do get very busy.  Our Waiter was very nice, and offered up some great suggestions for noobs like us (this was only my 2nd time eating Indian food). We ended up ordering the Chicken Tikki Masala, and the Coconut chicken w/ rice. The food arrived reasonably quickly, and neither dish was runny at all like other reviews point out. Everything was hot, and delicious, and there was enough left over for probably 1 meal. It did take awhile for our server to get our check to us, but he was very aware cause when he brought our check he also brought some complimentary ice cream as an apology and a thank you for our patience.  Over all I had a great experience at this restaurant and wish it hadn't taken us so long to try. We will be back.

We were looking to join a gym recently, but when we showed up to talk to someone and get a tour, they wanted us to fill out these liability release forms and sign them. Why do we have to divulge all of our personal information including our date of birth and sign a liability release form just to get a tour? We walked out. That seemed like a red flag. A sneaky way to get us on some kind of spam mailing list or something. No Thanks! We went straight to LA Fitness and they were happy to give us a tour right when we walked in.

Leah, the trainer, at Dog House Training Academy is great. She's friendly, knowledgable, and makes herself available via e-mail or phone should you have any questions. Her knowledge on dogs is extensive, and even though you're just paying for the class, she'll gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog. The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasn't picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques. I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer. She's very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works. So there are no questions, and it's always made perfect sense to me. With the quality of service, and the knowledge that you get to tap into while you're training with Leah, you just can't find a better deal out there. Her rates are competitive, and she offers referral discounts too.
