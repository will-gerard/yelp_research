Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends.

They have the BEST carne asada and bean burritos I have had anywhere in Phoenix and I have eaten at lots of places!  5 stars all the way!

Not impressed in the slightest.  With the Sliders.  They were dry and you couldn't even taste any of the "teriyaki glaze" that was supposed to make it a "Hawaiian Slider".  My brother-in-law is Hawaiian and his sliders are 110% better.  They need to do something to theirs to make them more moist and make them more authentic.  I will go back and try a hot dog next time but I won't get the sliders ever again.  Also they only take cash.  So I had to leave, go to the bank and come back.  Not good!  They took the drive thru away that the building had.  Wished they would have had it since I was getting ours to go.  The girl up front was confused and not very friendly.  All in all not a good experience.
