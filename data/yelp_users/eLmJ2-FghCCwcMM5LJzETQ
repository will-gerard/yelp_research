I may be a bit biased, as we got married at the Ritz Carlton Phoenix, but we went to Bistro 24 for our anniversary dinner a year later, and had an amazing time. The atmosphere is absolutely lovely and the service is top notch.  We enjoyed the warm bread served to the table as well as the *Caesar Salad* which we shared as a starter. My husband had a *Chicken* dish and he thought that it was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  I had a *Veggie Burger* which was absolutely delicious. It was a housemade patty with a chutney of some sort on top of it and caramelized onion. It was delightful. The french fries were perfectly cooked and spiced! We can't wait to go back again soon :)

Houston's is always consistent. Always a wait, always good service, always good food. It's worth the wait for the delicious housemade *Veggie Burger* with a soy glaze. It's out of this world. I also love their *coleslaw*. It's housemade and has a good amount of green onion and it's not soaked in mayonnaise.  They have baked potatoes the size of your head. Mmm, always perfectly cooked. My husband loves their *Ribs*

These are the best bagels you can get in Phoenix. DJ's in Fountain Hills is a close second. It is the closest you can get to a true NYC bagel.  I typically get the bagels to go, though I know they have sandwich options for both Breakfast and Lunch. My favorite bagel is the Black Russian. Pumpernickel with Sesame Seeds.

I'm not crazy about the Blue Burrito Grill. I like that they have all you can eat chips and salsa. They are serve yourself and the salsa are good. I usually get the vegetarian burrito bowl and for some reason it always ends up watery and not very flavorful. I think Chipotle, Qdoba, and Fiesta Burrito are a lot better.

I love Four Peaks. I like to try to support Local Restaurants whenever possible, and Four Peaks Brewery makes it easy! Admittedly, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but when we have out of town guests we always stock Kilt Lifter, and they are always very appreciative- so I guess it is good! Anyway, the atmosphere is very much pub and loud with games, and people drinking.   The food is NOT your typical bar food. Everything seems to be made in house.   I love the Garden Burger. I add Sauteed Onions and Mushrooms, a little bit of mayo and it is completely a sloppy, yummy mess. I'm obsessed. The bun is buttered and grilled.  I often try not to get a side of french fries and opt for salad. The salad is always fresh and their ranch dressing is homemade and fabulous. When I do opt for the French Fries I always enjoy them. They are so perfectly fried and seasoned. They are beer battered along with much of the fried goods at Four Peaks. REALLY great fries. I also use the ranch for those ;)  Other Hits Include appetizers like: Bavarian Pretzels- Mmm spicy mustard sauce! Spanakopita Garlic Beer Bread Thai Hummus- with peanut sauce  AND if I didn't have a difficulty with lactose, I would finish the Spinach and Artichoke dip on my own in about 3 seconds flat.  They also have a great Vegetable Beer Bread.  They have a surprising amount of Vegetarian Options, and I know that carnivores go crazy for their food as well.   I highly recommend Four Peaks to anyone and everyone!

Redendo's is always delicious. You can always count on getting a high quality meal. The pizzas are New York style and cooked to perfection using quality ingrediants. There are a variety of salads which come in two different sizes. I call them "huge" and "really huge." I always get the Greek Empire salad. The dressing is amazing, and they pack it full of olives, which makes it even more incredible.  The garlic knots are doughy and seasoned. I love the sauce that you dip them in as well. Grade A on everything. My husband loves the Meatball Sandwich and the Pizza of course. Cute atmosphere, very small.  Old school. Lots of Rat Pack on the stereo.

I frequent DJ's Bagel Cafe. I have NEVER ordered anything that I didn't enjoy. They are very accommodating to special requests (adding or subtracting things off salads, putting feta cheese on a bagel sandwich instead of chedder, ordering something that isn't on the menu) DJ's portions are substantial. A side of potatoes takes up a whole plate, they stack the meat on their bagel sandwiches, their salads fill a dinner plate and are piled high.  Their omelets are perfectly cooked on the grill and stuffed full of yummy ingrediants. Their bagels are the perfect amount of chewy and so well seasoned (when you get a flavored variety). I usually get the Caesar Salad or the Greek Salad. The Caesar salad is really something special, the croutons are large garlic asiago bagel chips. Amazing. The Greek Salad dressing is delicious.  On the side of Bagel Sandwiches, or even with salads, I always get a 1/4 pound of Macaroni Salad. Their recipe is out of this world. Just the right amount of dill and relish. I love it. DJ's has a variety of pastries, rice krispie treats, croissants, etc. Every item that I have tried has been top of the line. On top of everything, everyone at DJ's is really friendly and helpful. Even when there's a long line, it doesn't take a while to get your order in and  PLUS- they have DIPSY DOODLES. I haven't seen them since I lived on the East Coast, and they are so salty and awesome. I never miss a chance to head to DJ's bagels.

The last two times I went to DJ's I had bad experiences.   1. There was a dark hair in my bagel sandwich. 2. There was a lady bug in my Greek Salad.   I think I'll be skipping DJ's from now on. Too bad, because I loved it.

We really enjoyed our dinner at the Euro Pizza Cafe. We went on a Wednesday night. It was very busy on the patio, but we had no problem getting a table with a perfect view of the Fountain. There was a guitarist and vocalist on the Grapeables patio next door, so we even had some music to add to the ambiance.   Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  We started off with the Hummus appetizer and Garlic Knots. The Hummus was awesome. It had a little kick because of the cayenne pepper, but not too much. It was a little thick and gritty, which I can get into sometimes.  It was served with pizza dough that had been grilled and sliced like pita. Incredible. I really can't say enough about how amazing this appetizer was. I highly reccommend it.   The garlic knots were delicious as well. The sauce that they serve to dip them in was so good that I could eat it with a spoon, and I don't do that sort of thing!  For dinner I got a simple greek salad, which was ok- nothing exciting. I would probably skip the salad next time and get something else off the appetizer menu and really gorge myself.  The rest of my party ordered a cheese pizza and really enjoyed it. My mother and husband split an order of meatballs as well, and they raved about how amazing they were. Moist and flavorable.  We are excited to go back to the Euro Pizza Cafe soon!

We used to frequent the Cove years ago and couldn't figure out why we stopped going. After getting a groupon, we decided to head back.   We started with the yummy bread and roasted red pepper spread. Yum. Very good. The bread portions were small, but that's ok because we were going to have pizza. My mom, husband and I split a Caesar salad. It was very good. I liked the addition of cashews. It was a generous portion.  My husband and mother split a meatball, sausage pizza- they liked it. My dad and I split a Margherita pizza. When it came we should have sent it back. The whole center was swimming in grease but we were hungry and we figured that it would take too long to wait for a new one. When you hold up a piece of the pizza the whole end drooped and dripped. Disgusting. We cut off the ends and ate the rest of the pizza. Now, I have a heavy lead feeling in my stomach. Gross.   The waiter was very nice. He comped the pizza and brought more bread by my request (I had to try to soak up the bread). The new bread basket was very generous.   If I ever go back to the Cove, which is very unlikely, I would get the Caesar Salad and bread and call it a day.

We had brunch at Lon's today for my parents anniversary. It was a really nice experience. Unfortunately, we were unable to sit on the famed patio because it was rainy, but we loved the Southwestern motif of the dining rooms, complete with the kiva fireplaces. The art on the walls, is obviously, fabulous.   We started with the *Monkey Bread*. It was delicious. Absolutely yummy! Very sugary- it was actually swimming in syrup and frosting, and then covered with pecans. How decadent. I actually ate a 3rd of the dish, and was almost completely full. I didn't leave myself enough room for the *Chopped Salad* full of fresh vegetables. I got it without the turkey and cheese, but I'm assuming if you like that kind of thing, it would add something to the dish. They were very good about subbing a hardboiled egg for the turkey. It was dressed lightly with a cilantro vinaigrette, and had the crunch of pumpkin seeds throughout. I was really surprised with how generous the portion was. Lon's isn't about charging a good amount for a little bit of food, they pile it on!  My parents both got the *Lemon Ricotta Pancakes*. They weren't anything like the pancakes you are used to. They are circular and tall, but not in the least bit dense. The compote served along with them was the perfect compliment to the lemon of the lemony whipped cream and pancake. They probably could have spit an order, as they both had leftovers!  My husband got the *Lon's Club*. He complimented the bread, being a little harder on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. It was piled high with chicken breast, ham, cheese, avocado and aoili. It came with a side of either salad or french fries and their famous apple slaw. He chose the french fries, which I was very happy about because they were perfectly cooked, and really well seasoned... I stole more than a few. He said the apple slaw was refreshing. It had raisins in it as well.   We can't wait to go back to Lon's. The cost of the brunch was very reasonable. $74 without tax or tip. 4 entrees, and a starter, coffee and tea.

I really like Fiesta Burrito. When my Husband suggested we go here, I was a little nervous because it looks a little bit sketchy. When we went inside, it was pretty clean. The staff was really nice and accommodating when I ordered at the window, asking for no cheese and this and that. I got a Bean Tostada and Bean Taco.  Everything is made fresh, and tastes that way. I really enjoyed the Rice as well.  Their Pico is really onion heavy, but it balances well with the food. I also like their Green Salsa.  I will say, I'm not sure if their beans or rice are vegetarian. I'm sort of "if I don't have to chew it, I don't know it is there" vegetarian, so enter with caution if you aren't this way.  The meal really didn't feel greasy or too guilty, even though I'm sure it was!

Nice atmosphere. Great patio for outdoor dining. The most standout dish of the night was the soup. Pasta e Fasioli- it was delicious. Well balanced, hearty, great flavor. They have a fairly large menu for a small Trattoria, and the prices are fair.

I'll fully admit that I am a regular of this Pita Jungle location. I come here an average of times a week. Usually I meet friends for their awesome Happy Hour and come on the weekend for dinner with my Husband or Family. The servers area always really attentive and helpful. They are great with substitutions and picky orders.    When at Happy Hour, I don't really drink the alcoholic beverages, but prefer their Decaf Berry Iced Tea which is delicious.   Happy Hour is CHEAP and served Tapas style (I believe it is from 3-5:30 and then Reverse from 9-close). For $6 I can get a full meal. I usually get an array of the following:  -Falafel with Tahni (This is always delicous, just the right seasoning and texture) -Hummus Trio (I love their Hummus, flavorful, smooth and just the right consistency. You get about two-three tablespoons per order) -Feta (They give you a block of feta cheese, drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped cucumbers, onion and tomato, zataar as well. It's delicious) -Baba Ghanoush (REALLY nice and creamy. I don't love egglplant, but I love the subtle smokiness of this dip) -Pita with Thyme and Olive Oil (This is basically a small pizza with olive oil, thyme, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. It's perfectlly cooked and always yummy) -Olives (They would probably be a little bit better if they were heated, but they have a great variety). The dips are served with Pita and it is always the perfect consistency. Just soft enough but still with a little chew.  All of these items run $1 or $2. It's incredible. I'm a vegetarian, but I know that my friends enjoy the Chicken and Shrimp options. They also have a very fresh looking caprese tapa.  For dinners, I've tried a variety of Items, I really like the Mediterranean Platter but it's just too much food for me. I love their cold garlic and tomato green beans that come on this dish but you can also get them as a side dish.  I often get an order of Lentils and Rice, Feta Cheese, Small side of hummus, and 2 falafel balls (which come with their rich and awesome Tahini). I mix them all together and made a Mediterranean Burrito Bowl. It's awesome, and I always appreciate that the wait staff is accommodating.  Also, their Red Lentil soup is a notable starter. It's really perfectly balanced and flavorful.  My husband is easier than me. He enjoys the Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Shwarma. He also likes the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. We come with large groups and people always seem to enjoy their meals and order a variety of menu items.  They have a great patio which we enjoy sitting on for nice days/nights. For large groups- as far as I know they don't take reservation and sometimes there's a 30-40 minute wait for groups bigger than 4 on a Saturday night. We never really mind waiting though.  I love Pita Jungle.

My husband would give My Big Fat Greek 0 stars, but I'm going to give it 2. We actually used to go to the location in Scottsdale, and we've also been to this location many times. We always enjoyed our meals there.   We didn't have it tonight, but I especially like the Bruschetta. It's a huge portion. I like the grilled foccacia and all that tops it, including tomatoes, basil, hummus and sweet balsamic reduction. It's served around a nice marinara sauce that is also topped with a bunch of junk. This is the highlight.  On this trip I got a large Greek Salad. I like the creamy type greek dressing.. it's atypical for Greek salad, but I'm into it. I also like the warm pita that surround the large bowl. I get a little side of jalepeno cilantro hummus and dip away.   My husband got chicken and lamb souvlaki tonight. The wooden skewer broke into his lamb so he had to do surgery to remove it. The lamb had gristle, the chicken was under seasoned. The side vegetables were undercooked and cold, and the rice was tepid.   When the manager came by asking how everything was, my husband gave him the FYI- and he was kind and ordered us a dessert. We declined. My husband was turned off by the chipped plate of his appetizer salad, a cricket crawling along the ground (in all fairness the door to the patio was open), and the light above our table flickering on and off.   We had a savvy dining coupon for buy one entree get one free and our bill still came to $30. We had to order two drinks to get the coupon. My husband got a Sprite, and I asked for a hot decaf tea. They said they had chamomile, but then came back to tell me that they're out of all decaf teas, so I got an apple juice I didn't drink.  The $30 meal included: Lamb and Chicken Souvlaki meal with side Greek Salad Large Greek Salad with ramekin of hummus Sprite Apple Juice  We thought it was pricey for a buy one get one deal. The drinks were $3 a piece, so really we just got $3 off of my salad, because if it weren't for the coupon we wouldn't have ordered drinks.  Our waitress was very nice.  Edited: I had to drop it to one star. My husband had serious stomach issues the whole night.

I really enjoy Chloe's Corner, mostly because of their Egg Salad Sandwich. Their Egg Salad is really creamy with notes of mustard, and large pieces of egg throughout. It's really quite good. I like the style of the restaurant as well.  You order at the counter, get a number, and then take a seat. They also have a refrigerator section where you can get to-go items and pasta salads that aren't on their menu. I often get a side of the Greek Pasta salad. It can be a little hit or miss because sometimes the pasta is too oily and needs to be drained a bit. They also have big jars of old fashion candy and large house-made individually wrapped cookies. It's a cute concept. Chloe's Corner is a good place to grab a quick bit while shopping at Kierland.

I really like Wally's. I've tried several options there. My favorite is the *Chop Chop Salad*- it's a nice combination of vegetables and I like the honey mustard dressing that it's tossed with. They don't put too much dressing so it's not soggy, but it's nicely coated.  I also like the *Veggie Burger*- It's a housemade patty which I always appreciate.  Their *Basil Hummus* appetizer is also very nice.  My husband and father both rave about their *Fish and Chips*- Fried but never too greasy, and nice pieces of fish.   Wally's is definitely upscale pub food and a nice atmosphere. The wait staff is always kind and the restaurant is always clean!

We love Sauce.  My husband and I each get a Caesar Salad and split a create your own pizza:  Original Thin Crust No Sauce on Pizza (we get it on the side) Cheese Feta Roasted Red Peppers  Olives  Delicious. The pizza is nice and thin but SO flavorful!  I also like their side Pasta, Red Sauce, and Mozzarella.  The people who work there are always nice and the restaurant is lovely and clean.

I love North. I think the atmosphere is awesome. They have a great patio and a nice interior. The wait staff is always polite and helpful. The restaurant is nicely kept and clean. They give you delicious marinated olives and bread with a compound butter on the table, and I really appreciate that. I've tried many meals there.  My favorites include: *Caesar Salad*- Always well balanced. *Italian Salad*- (hold the salami)- A really yummy, acidic salad. Just the way I like it. *Bucatini*- Delicious sauce, pasta always cooked perfectly Al Dente  My husband always gets the *Papperdelle* with Braised Short Ribs. He loves it. The meat is always tender, and it's always bursting with flavor.  Things I've tried that I wasn't crazy about: *Zucca Chips*- they taste just like thin potato chips that are overly fried. Not that interesting. Overrated.  They have Happy Hour all day on Sunday, which discounted food. How fabulous!

Food- The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. The chips are homemade and a little bit thicker than most restaurant tortilla chips. The salsa is also really good. I typical get a mixture of side dishes and mix them together to make a "naked" burrito or burrito bowl. The beans are perfectly seasoned and really flavorful. Same with the rice. Their charred corn is always cooked well. I did get the carrots and jalepenos one time, and it was SO spicy that I couldn't eat it. I have a medium tolerance for spice.  I also enjoy the White Peach and Hibiscus Margarita. It has a great flavor.  My husband typically gets the Machaca Burrito made Enchilada style. It comes in a cast iron type individual casserole dish.   Service- The servers are really attentive and helpful, giving suggestions of menu items and accommodating special requests.  Decor- The design of the restaurant is really cool. Nice blues and whites, huge industrial type light fixtures. A nice patio and stocked bar in the middle of the main dining room.  In all fairness, we don't frequent Blanco, because you can get Mexican food that is just as good at a cheaper price point, but I do enjoy splurging on the ambiance of Blanco once in a while.

I'm surprised by the low ratings that Tandoori Times has received. We really enjoy coming here, and will often come for family dinners when people come into town.   We really enjoy the Belly Dancing. The women are talented, balancing candles, swords, etc. It's something different and it's always fun when someone at our table gets up and dances too!  We also enjoy the Hookah Lounge on the Patio. The Patio is a really nice private spot. They have tons of different flavors and the staff is always helpful and attentive.   The free Chai is also quite delicious.  I love the House Salad, the dressing is really delicious. It is a yogurt based dressing with very delicious spices. I really could eat it with a spoon, but I keep it classy and refrain. I also order the Vegetable Biryani- it's perfectly seasoned and absolutely amazing. It is delicate, a little spicy and really shows perfect restraint.   We love getting the Naan. My favorites are: Garlic (Mmmm so well seasoned) Onion Aloo (Stuffed with potato) Chii Naan with Cilantro and and Green Chili (Just the right amont of kick) AND My husband loves the Keema Naan (minced Lamb)  Dishes that are notable (so says my family): Chicken Tikka Masala Chicken Saag Tandoori Fish (My discerning Father in Law called it one of the best dishes he's ever had. Many at the table agreed) Also, I forget which but a few of the Lamb dishes are a hit (sorry not that helpful)  Tandoori Times isn't a cheap Indian joint, but we don't mind paying for the quality of food and the experience.

Our meal was absolutely incredible at Flapjacks. I read online that we should be prepared to wait in line on a Saturday morning. We didn't need to. Had no problem getting a table for 8. The restaurant is located in a strip mall and is not that impressive to the eye. It's very clean and simple on the inside. They didn't have the blinds open at all, so I took the liberty of opening them slightly to let some natural light in. What the restaurant lacked in ambiance, they made up for in food and service.  There was a list of specials on a chalk board that included a quiche of the day, a coconut pineapple oven baked pancake, pigs in a blanket, and blueberry almond croissant french toast (there were more but those are all I can remember off the top of my head). Everybody gave rave reviews on their dishes. According to the party the Pigs in a Blanket were awesome. The sausage was well cooked and seasoned, and the pancakes were light and not too sweet. The blueberry almond croissant french toast, which sounded like it would be sickly sweet, was well balanced and delicious. The palisades omelet was great, and the toast and potatoes were average and what you would expect them to be. The blueberry pancakes were "delightful."  My husband got the apple nut oven baked pancake. It came out fully puffed up and deflated as it got to the table. It was delicious (I stole more than a few bites), the apples were the perfect consistency and it was sweet enough that it didn't need syrup, but not so sweet that it was difficult to eat the whole thing. He also ordered a side of sausage, he said it was cold in the middle, and the waitress quickly brought it back to the kitchen and gave him a piping hot order.   I ordered the greek omelet, made with egg whites. It was cooked to absolute perfection. It was perfectly stuffed and seasoned. I got the side of pancakes. They were light and fluffy. I put a little bit of butter on them and it was the perfect meal!   It was my Father in Law's Birthday and I offhandedly mentioned it to the waitress, when he was asking for raisins to be thrown into his old fashion oven pancake, not only did they throw in the raisins, but they also put a candle in his butter and sang to him. It was a very nice touch. The service was awesome. Two waitresses were constantly refilling coffee cups, water glasses, etc. It was noted several times that the coffee was great at our table as well. I had the Earl Grey tea. They served it already steeped in a teapot and it was delicious.

I like Bosa Donuts!  My husband brought me here and we shared a bag of donut holes. Glazed and Chocolate. The Chocolate actually had rich chocolate taste, and the consistency and smushiness of the glazed was awesome :)  I like that it is local, and they do a great job.  I would recommend Bosa's for a treat :)

Top of the line buffet. It rivals some of the best in Vegas. We've been there for lunch, dinner, and Sunday Brunch. All were great. The lunch buffet was a great price ($13.95), for a fabulous spread. Dinner was delicious as well ($20.95 week days). The real star is Sunday Brunch .   Mimosas or Bloody Mary's including in the $27.95 price tag.They have a salad bar, international offerings, an omelet station, spicy boar bacon (family members love this!),  cheeses and antipasto, pizza, pastas, an array of desserts, and a full gelato bar.   It's beautiful, it's clean, fresh and out of this world!

We took my Father In Law to the All American Sports Grill for his birthday. It was a Sunday night and there were 6 of us. We went in at 6:30pm with no reservations, and had no problem getting a table on the patio, overlooking the beautiful Fountain lake. Service was great. The manager greeted us as we walked in as if we were long lost pals, though we had never been the establishment before. Our waitress was sweet and prompt, and the busser was also very friendly. Also, when my dad asked for a specific game to be turned on, they were happy to oblige. There were TVs everywhere, even on the patio. We ordered the following, with the following comments:  Myself- Greek Salad, it was good. Just the right dressing to lettuce ratio, very fresh. I usually pick out odd pieces of lettuce that don't look crisp, and I didn't have to do that at all with this salad. I'm a big salad eater, so this is saying a lot.  Husband- Cheeseburger and Fries. He enjoyed it. He ordered it Medium Well and it was cooked to perfection. The fries were nicely cooked as well and perfectly salted, which I can report on because I stole about half of them.  Father- Very picky eater. He ordered a plain chicken sandwich, on a roll, with fries. Usually people will throw lettuce and tomato on the sandwich when he explicitly asks for them not to be. They didn't do that here. He was very happy about this. He said the chicken was well seasoned.  Mother- Bleu Cheese Burger and Sweet potato fries. She said the burger was delicious. They gave her a heaping portion of grilled onions, so many that she actually shared them with my FIL's girlfriend that was dining with us. They gave her a heaping helping of sweet potato fries as well. Very nice portions.   Father in Law/GF- Father in Law and his girlfriend split the Spinach Salad and the Smoked Wings. They raved about both of these dishes.They loved the Spinach Salad. Felt is was very fresh and the dressing was delicious. They both loved the Smoked Wings. The waitress told them that they were fall of the bone moist, and they sure were. They said they had never had wings like that. Father in law also commented that the Bleu Cheese Dressing was very potent, just how he liked it.  On the overall, we enjoyed it. I do prefer Four Peaks' food to All American Sports Grill's but the patio is so nice and the food was good that it makes it worth the trip!

I love all of the Vegan and Vegetarian Options at True Foods. I also love that I feel good about eating the food there. It is fresh, clean and organic.  The decor of the restaurant is simple, and they have an awesome patio that wraps around the outside of the restaurant. There is a little herb garden on the patio as well. I love that you know where a good amount of the herbs are grown. Scottsdale Quarter is beautiful as well, and I enjoy sitting outside and seeing people enjoy the public space. The patio also has good misters.  The Natural Refreshers are a great option. Organic and interesting tonics. I enjoy the Natural (ginger, agave, soda).  I love the Miso Soup. I've heard people complain that it is too salty, but I like salty so it works for me. It's also a Vegan Miso soup which is great because I won't eat a Miso with Fish.  The Hummus Appetizer is delicious. I love the Greek Chop Chop served on top and often ask for extra which the wait staff is happy to bring. The hummus can lean towards a little too much garlic depending on the day.  The Local Vegetable Crudite, is literally HUGE fresh vegetables. It is a little awkward to eat, but the dips that were served with it are pretty good.  I like the Mediterranean Chopped Salad, It should be noted that the salad it very quinoa heavy, which to me is a good thing.  I've been wanting to try the Roasted Corn and Kale Pesto Pizza, but unfortunately, I think it's a Summer Menu option, so I'll have to wait. Hopefully they bring it back!  My husband has gotten the Steak Tacos, and was not impressed by the portion, it was relatively small for what you can expect at True Foods. He now goes with the Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl with Chicken. He really enjoys it.  The best part of the whole meal is DESSERT. They usual have a VEGAN Ice Cream which I enjoy, not because I'm Vegan but because I"m lactose intolerant. I love LOVE love LOVE love (get it?) the Warm Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble with Vegan Vanilla Ice Cream. Sweet, Tart, it's just incredible!  For the Winter it switches to a Warm Apple Crisp with a Pecan Ice Cream (Vegan). It's really wonderful. It's very oat and fruit heavy and just delightful. For $7 you really can't beat this dessert.  We have also tried a Lemon dessert in the summer, and Olive Oil Cake in the Winter, both were good, but the Crumbles are really where it's at. For the quality of food, the prices are very fair.

The Herb Box is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  The decor is nice and calming and so well applied. The location on the Scottsdale canal is really nice and there's a large patio that takes advantage of this. The menu has so many different options and tastes that a variety of people will enjoy. There is also a take out area, that has a small markets selling some of the favorites (hummus, salads, etc) Servers are always helpful, professional and attentive.  Here are some of the menu items I have enjoyed and notes about them. I am disappointed that they took off their Falafel dinner option. It came with two dips, falafel, and a salad. They took it off the menu a little while ago!  Iced Teas- They always have a variety of flavors and they're all well balanced and delicious.  Tzatziki+Hummus+Olives+Pita- Their Red Pepper Hummus has a  nice subtle spice to it, and the white bean artichoke is out of this world awesome. It's not as creamy as most Middle Eastern hummus' I enjoy, but it is a different breed and done so well. The olives are a great variety and the pita is good.  Crisp Falafel with Tahini Yogurt Sauce and Greek Salsa- The falafel aren't heavy or overly spiced, they are very light and so perfect. I actually don't put them in the same vein as other Falafel because they are so different. Same as I wrote about for the hummus. They are some of my favorite falafel though. The Tahini has a subtle lemon flavor and it's incredible. I could eat it with a spoon. I always as for extra Greek Salsa because it's yummy as well.   Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas- These are light but filling with incredible ingredients then blend well together (Cojita, Spiced Pecans, Tomatillo- it works)  The Grow Happy Salad- Not your everyday salad. Pepitas, Pepperoncinis. Feta. Just awesome and filling in it's own right.  I want to try Brunch soon. The Red Velvet Pancakes are calling to me.

I love Rita's! I remember enjoying SO many summer nights full of water ice back in Philadelphia, so you can imagine my excitement when I realized that Rita's followed me to the Valley of the Sun ;)  The Cream Ice is delicious. I love the Mint Chocolate Chip and Mint Oreo. The S'mores is also yummy.   The non-cream Ice flavors are often too sweet for me. My husband and parents love the Custard!

I have to admit, I've only tried one dish at Grassroots and it is the salad. Now, I love a good salad, but honestly- when I read the different ingredients in this Seasonal Vegetable Chop salad, I was tentative. It seems like a odd mix (cabbage, grilled butternut squash,  gold and red beets, edamame, parsley, English cucumber, scallions, radishes, basil, grapes, grape tomatoes, feta, corn) but somehow, married with the really delicious Champagne Vinaigrette this salad sings. I actually crave it. Sometimes I pick it up takeout ;)  The decor in the restaurant is awesome. Cool artwork, country chic vibe. They have Scrabble Boards build into some of their tables, and Mason Jar chandeliers. Outside on the pretty, green patio they have their own garden.   You can tell that a lot of thought went into this restaurant concept and execution. The people I typically dine with have gotten a variety of meals and enjoyed everyone. The place is clean and well maintained.   I just wish that there were more vegetarian options on the regular menu and on the happy hour. Also, Happy Hour prices for food really aren't that much of an incentive.

The Key Lime Pie and Coconut Cream Pie pushed my reviews up. The Coconut Cream pie is the best I've ever had. YUM!!! Even my husband that isn't crazy about Coconut Cream pie LOVES it!  Also, I love their Coleslaw!

I love Which Wich. Their bread is REALLY good. I also like that you can get it "skinny" (the'll scoop the inside). I typically create my own veggie. Medium, skinny, hot, mozzarella cheese, light mayo, red onions, coleslaw, black olives, pickles, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and bell peppers crushed pepper and oregano. YUM!  I also like their black bean patty.  I like that they serve warm sandwiches and that you fill out the bag and hand it to them, so I've never had a mistake!

I love Saladworks Scottsdale!  I remember eating at Saladworks when living in Philadelphia and wishing it would make it's way to Arizona.  There are tons of options. They have salad recipe suggestions, and they have the opportunity for you to Create Your Own salad. I go with this option, because you can customize the salad of your dreams (yes! I dream about salad!). The staff then puts your salad together, either tossed with dressing, or dressing on the side. They never overdress it, so I get it tossed.   You get to choose your base which can be lettuce, lettuce and wheat pasta, lettuce and white pasta, or spring mix. I get the lettuce and white pasta, with egg whites, carrots, cucumber, feta cheese, and niciose olives tossed with Creamy Italian dressing.. The salads come with a wheat or white roll. The wheat roll is unbelievable. Very generous size, with seeds throughout, served warm and absolutely scrumptious.   They also have soups and sandwiches, which I haven't tried yet. The sandwiches have meat options, so this place isn't just for vegetarians.   Other things I like about Saladworks: They have a loyalty card. If you friend them on facebook, there is a daily deal. This includes once a week where they have buy one get one free salads. Also, they have a nutrition calculator on their website.

My family is a fan of Barro's so we were happy to hear that this location delivered to our houses. Got the pizza last night. Delivery took around an hour. The pizza came hot. It was in good shape, not too greasy, well cooked. Yum!
