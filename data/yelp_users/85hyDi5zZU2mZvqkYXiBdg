I called to make reservations a week in advance for a birthday party of 15 and while I was told they didn't take reservations, the man I spoke with was very confident that they would be able to accommodate us. He said he would make a note of my party size, have a group of tables set aside, took my name, and we were good to go (or so I thought). I showed up at 6pm just like I was instructed (30 minutes earlier than the party time) and was greeted by a very unhelpful hostess. She said she was not informed of the party and couldn't seat us for 2 hours. TWO HOURS?!? She provided no additional suggestions or options and asked us to take a seat. I'll take my business and tips elsewhere, thanks.

Came in in a huge rush today with a dead car battery and very little time to make it to an interview across town. Joe was available immediately and helped me get back on the road in about 10 minutes!! I even had a credit from the old battery that died, making the experience easy on my mind and my wallet. Thanks Joe!

Convenient location, quick drop off, fast turnaround, simple pick up. All for about $5 and I never had to get out of my car! Couldn't ask for more!

Came here on a whim because my normal go to was packed. When I got here there were no more than three or four clients inside, that should have been my first hint. The lady who greeted me left another customer mid manicure to come try to push me into a gel mani. I told her at least three times I did not want gel but she wouldn't take no for an answer. Finally she shoved the gel colors into my hand and walked away. I was directed to sit down at a station in front of a woman who smelled like smoke, not exactly the smell I'm hoping for in a salon. I had gels on currently and was surprised that they didn't use the typical acetone and foil method to remove them but instead ground the gel off with that spinning file.. Ummm what?! I asked her to shorten my nails which she was very hesitant to do telling me they were so pretty long. I had to ask multiple times before she would cut them and they still ended up longer than I would like. They charged me for a mani and an extra $5 for gel removal, which I'm not used to paying extra for. Other places I have been only charge for removal if you aren't having anything else done so I found that a bit strange but I just wanted to get out of there. Upon leaving and looking at my nails in the sunlight, I noticed most of them are not painted entirely and the clear coat is only in the middle of my nails, not on the edges. Needless to say I won't be back.

FLIES EVERYWHERE! Ick. I don't like having to fight with the flies for the first bite of my food. Not to mention the pizza makes me sick every time I go. If the flies in the dining room are any indication of the conditions of the kitchen, I think I'm better off eating elsewhere.  The one star is because they have awesome happy hour beer prices and a huge selection of beers on tap.

I was looking for a new summer look so I purchased the Groupon deal for a cut and color from Moda Forte. It had good reviews and is very close to me, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I saw Naomi who was very receptive to my requests. I brought in pictures and she spent time picking out the right colors for me. This was my first time having my hair colored so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the whole process took about 3 hours.  I am very happy with the cut and color and would visit Moda Forte again!

Awesome happy hour prices and a huge selection of tap beers. That's the only thing Mellow Mushroom has going for it. The appetizers are decent, and I usually get an order of the pretzels with beer cheese when I go, but they are underwhelming.  As for the pizza- it makes me sick every time. Every. Time. I have never had issues with pizza (in fact I just finished lunch at NYPD Pizza) before so I'm not sure what the deal is, but I assume there's something going on in the kitchen that I would rather not know about.  I'll be back for the beers during Happy Hour, but that's about it.
