Another disgusting tasting Chinese joint in Phoenix.  My order was simple - steamed dumplings and wonton soup.  The meat inside the filling tasted like something very questionable - not pork, not chicken, not beef.  Something dark and oily and ominous.  I could not eat either dish as both tasted as if they were filled with meat from the same mystery animal.  Waste of money.  So I ended up eating a small portion of a visiting relative's chicken and shrimp combo which was almost devoid of meat (might be a good thing, actually) and had absolutely no spice or kick or flavor.   Will not be back.

Coming from the east coast, I didn't realize the prices at Albertsons was considered more expensive than the average Phoenix grocery store.  I thought it was a bargain!  I loved coming here every few days to shop.  It was like a mecca of discounted items (compared to the east).  But I do agree they need to stock up on a better selection of wine, meats, and even dairy products (a written request for Fage greek yogurt went unnoticed).    Also, I think their wine guy is lacking in his vino knowledge.  He was obviously flustered when I asked for recommendations.  He seriously has no clue about wines.

24 Hour Fitness corporate ripped me off.  Plain and simple.  [BTW, this review is not necessarily a reflection of this particular location, but this was my gym.]  I called the number on the main website in July '10 to cancel my membership.  I was told that I would be billed for August anyway and that I could continue to go to the gym until the middle of August.  Which I didn't.    It's now November and much to my dismay I discover I've been billed for September and October.  Yes, true, perhaps I should check my account a little more regularly, but I wasn't expecting to get ripped off.  Come today, I actually step foot in the gym and was told "the manager will get back to me but I should have canceled through them, not call the number from the main website.  You know, the number that reads, "Membership cancellation."  Which I did.  Called the corporate number again.  And was told there was no notation next to my name which indicated that I ever called!  Can you believe it?  Apparently, they didn't.  However, as a "courtesy," they'll refund me for a whole month."  Then - "You should have canceled through us and not the actual gym."  Which I didn't.  So - which is it?  Do you call the number on the main website or do you cancel through the gym?      I did everything according to contract and still got screwed!  24 Hour Fitness corporate set a bad example of customer service, and their deceitful business practice cost them a future customer.  Whether the person whom I originally spoke to on the phone was blatantly or unwittingly negligent is irrelevant.  They should have given the customer the benefit of the doubt.    It's too bad that companies these days are so short sighted.  I'm moving and would have totally signed up with them again IF THEY DIDN'T RIP ME OFF.

Conversing with the manager has reiterated my initial impression - which I'll keep to myself.  After informing me that he, unlike Corporate, would not have refunded me a dime (re:  one month "courtesy" refund), he had the audacity to suggest I join a 24 Hour Fitness near my new place of residence.  Sorry but 24 Hour Fitness is not even a contender on the short list, or any list, for that matter.

Customized formulas and masterful color application is where Blue Campio excels.  His hair cuts are also on par.  As good as some of the Beverly Hills salons I've frequented minus the cost and the attitude.  Not for the impulsive. Blue is usually booked several weeks in advance.  Talk about tress distress!

This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  I repeat, the WORST EVER.  Anyone who writes otherwise must be a shill.  I knew it was not going to be up to par when I spotted all the Mexicans in the joint. Now, this is not saying anything against them, more so about whoever runs the kitchen.  They probably figured they didn't need to be up to snuff because they could get away with it which is a damn shame.  I hope all these people eat elsewhere and experience some decent Chinese food because this place ain't representing.  The food was oily and flavorless and the selections were limited and mostly breaded.  I've never been to a buffet that didn't have my favorite which is roasted chicken or duck.  I usually eat that and only that by the plateful.  Instead, I was stuck with dry tilapia and flavorless salmon.  The terriyaki chicken was nothing but dark meat and the sweet and sour chicken was absolutely horrid!  How can anyone f up such a standard dish?  It tasted as if it had been sauteed in ketchup!  I could even taste a hint of flour which leads me to believe it was undercooked.  And the sushi?  Forget it.  Horrid, horrid.  As for the dessert section, the chocolate cake looked exactly like the one you buy at KFC.  I imagine it probably tasted full of chemicals, too.    Everyone at my table was disgusted and we all agreed that we should have driven the extra mile to go to a better rated buffet.  We also concurred that the aquarium by the door (which contained numerous blood parrot cichlids and turtles) was an exercise in cruelty.  Thrown together into an inappropriately sized tank, the cichlids were relentlessly butting heads with the turtles who tried in vain to escape but had nowhere to go.  I hope they weren't part of the buffet.

Camped out for a week in one of the new suites on the 24th floor.  Breathtaking views from my room and the revolving rooftop restaurant!  Customer service in this hotel was excellent all around and my steak at Top of the World was one of the best I've ever had.  I also loved the little casino lounge as there was someone to talk to every time I sat and sipped wine by myself.  The servers were extra friendly, too.  My only complaint is housekeeping.    Not sure why my room was not stocked with tissue or toilet paper but I had the Do Not Disturb sign on my door for the majority of my stay and when I did request service from housekeeping, they were routinely negligent when it came to stocking items in my bathroom.  Perhaps there's a one t.p. roll at a time policy?  Not sure.  But I sure didn't like having to track down housekeeping just to request some basics.      I will definitely stay here again so long as they continue to treat me like a princess!  I love the unpretentious feel of the Stratosphere.  Two quick notes to self:  Check out pool, and bungee jump off roof!

Abiding by the falsely reassuring maxim - what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas - means omitting sordid details such as -  Topless private cabana spritzing Les Liaisons dangereuses featuring a Republican lobbyist Sushi outing with Canadian girls of dubious sexual orientation.  Can be declared with certainty, Caesars is a classic, worthy of Rome.

I love Mitch's and usually trust his judgment but I'm not too happy with his last recommendation (that I take my car to the Aamco in Scottsdale---see previous review).    Otherwise, if I still resided here, I would continue using Mitch's to service my car.  How can you not love an auto shop that has a library in the waiting room?  Very cool.  And Mitch has an...interesting sense of humor.  They'll even give you a ride home, that is, if you live within proximity.  Not sure how they deal with those further out.  Aside from the lousy transmission referral, I highly recommend.

Two very different experiences at the Mayo Clinic.  I was taken care of very well the first time.  Prompt service, attentive staff, and the kind of organization my half German side can appreciate.  Basically, what you expect from a top notch hospital especially when you are getting charged double to triple the price.  The most recent visit, however, falls on the opposite end of the spectrum.  Specifically, Dr Christopher Lipinski, possibly the rudest, most arrogant, brash, condescending, abrasive, uncaring ER physician---or for that matter---ANY physician I've ever had the misfortune of meeting.  His bedside manners leave much to be desired.  Is he a doctor or an obnoxious frat boy dressed like one?  Does he care one iota about the patient or does he think he's doing you a favor by being in the same room with you?    Maybe one day he'll adjust his very bad attitude.  http://www.mayoclinic.org/bio/13735799.html

What's to say that hasn't been said....this place ROCKS!  Bev-- what? Exactly.  BTW, I found my true love here.  Cheap and good.  Angeline Pinot Noir, the $15 bottle.  Un Effing Believable.  A weeknight staple in my mini cellar.  And a big thank you to the very knowledgeable employees who introduced me to it, and the cute Peter Sarsgaard lookalike who works there.  Sorry we never got to imbibe together.  Cheers!

Let's be real here, shall we?  This is a place to come drink and girl watch.  The ladies that work here are good looking and the service is sufficient.  Otherwise ---   Bastardized Mediterranean food catering to indiscriminating taste buds.  The use of the word pita implies Mediterranean or Middle Eastern fare but the menu offers more...much more....and a lot of it tastes like crap that was made up on a whim.  Some of the dishes don't make sense to me, at least palate wise.  The ingredients are juxtaposed nonsensically.  Take the Gambas Con Ajo.  Served with pesto?  It simply doesn't work.   A waste of space on the menu.  My friend concurred that it wasn't good - at all.  When I queried the bartender---Kat Von D's doppelg√§nger--- if Pita Jungle was a hybrid restaurant, she looked at me as if I'd just dropped in from another planet.  Having lived on the highly cultured east coast for a number of years, this kind of food snobbery is permanently ingrained.  I am particular about the authenticity of my food, so if you have a hankering for Meditteranean, look elsewhere.  Probably somewhere very far outside of Phoenix, perhaps even a neighboring state (hint - Cali 4 Ni A).  In fact, to categorize Pita Jungle as Meditteranean is a misnomer.  Arizona was voted as one of the least educated states, second in line to Nevada.  Don't get me wrong as I love Arizona; however, we as a nation should do our best to help bring them out of their educational rut.  Chicken Tikka Masala?  Last time I checked, India is a part of the continent of Asia.  [Yes, I'm being an uptight jackass.  Sorry.]

I always have fun at Blue Martini and meet tons of people to chat with and the service in general is great, too.  The bartenders are very nice and attentive and I've never had to wait long for a drink.  Even though it can get crowded, I've yet to wait in a line for the bathroom, either.  Speaking of which...  I really wish they'd do away with the concept of bathroom attendants.  I think I'm old enough to know how to wash and dry my own hands.  Also, I don't carry cash so it's awkward feeling like a cheapskate when you're anything but and you can't tip the lady.  This was so aptly pointed out by a snotty, awkwardly tall, raven haired patron powdering her nose in front of the mirror.  If I didn't know any better I would have mistaken her for someone who'd just had a sex change or a corpse that had just been reanimated because she had the waxiest face ever.  After apologizing to the attendant for not being able to tip, the wax faced tranny rolled her eyes and said, "What?  You don't have any AMERICAN DOLLARS?" I felt she was implying I was an illegal since I am of mixed heritage and am often mistaken for a variety of races.  I'm not sure why white people feel they have to go there.  Isn't being white enough?  Not that it was any of her business, but I explained that I don't carry cash.  I also admonished her for rolling her eyes (I was too buzzed to dish out a proper tongue lashing) but she was too busy staring at herself in the mirror to care.    "This is Scottsdale, honey," she shot back, still powdering her face.   No, this is PHOENIX, Einstein.  Blue Martini is in Phoenix, not Scottsdale.  And not everyone carries cash to pay by the hour, you freakin' snotty ho.  But it's one of those things you don't think to say until AFTER the fact.  Another typical brainless and uneducated Scottsdale fem bot who is obviously geographically challenged.  Hopefully, she'll succumb to makeup poisoning and stay IN the grave.
