Since it's walking distance from our house I like to try places near us.  This was our 3rd visit to Cherry Blossom.  We'll, we have made the decision it's not that great.    Food:  Average...believe me there is better.   Service:  Wait staff is always overwhelmed and run around like chicken with their heads cut off.  We were sitting near a table being cleaned off by a frantic employee and she was wiping so fast the dirty food was hurdled into our table top - gross!  Have to beg to get our green ice tea refilled, trying to make eye contact with service staff and they avoid you. The whole place is under staffed and overwhelmed.    NOTE:  Manager/Owner = Get a food runner.  Thats all they do -- run food!  It's simple. I am sure the service staff doesn't want to pay out their tips to a food runner.  But, its either that or loose more customers due your very bad service.

This is one of my favorite places in the city.  1/2 price bottle of wine from 3 pm to close, great bar drinks (pricey yes) and simple but good food.  Piano player is unbelievable!   Has a feeling that just maybe and I mean maybe - Phoenix has a little bit of culture.  I have continued to go to My Florist Cafe for over 6 years and being from Seattle where culture will jump out and grab you My Florist always delivers a little "Seattle" - thank you and keep it up guys!

I've been going here for many years. But, now I am looking for another place to cut my hair.  Why?  LONG ASS WAITS- I checked in via their mobile app, which says, 56 mins.  I arrive 60 mins later and I am still waiting over 45 minutes to hit the chair.  This has happened 3 times in one month and the other two times I left before getting my haircut.    This location is always under staffed....Seeking new barber.

Kris and his team shifted my paradigm of what I believed to be a car buying experience.  Flexible, non stressful, patience, huge variety of cars to see ( you don't need to go from dealership to dealership) they pretty much have it all.  I drove over 12 cars in 2 days and decided on a 2012 VW CC with 450 miles on it.  Great $$ deal and Great car.  Got a brand new car without paying the brand new price.  2nd, you don't feel the slimy, needy, pushy energy you get from most dealerships.  These guys are all family and make you feel like your coming into their house.  I'll will recommend anyone who's looking for a car to LeSueur Car Company.  Give them a try!   Thanks Guys.

Royal Flush Fail!  Your new concept "Asian Market" was a very bad move.  We used to go to this location at least once a month.  Since, your shift  to market concept we drive right on bye...:(  It sucks because it was a fall back restaurant in our neighborhood. Its now one step up 'maybe" from Panda Express. NOT!

So I heard things had changed and went back to the way they used to be so I decided to try it again since its in my neighborhood.   We'll, all that changed was that they brought back plates vs plastic take out.  I ordered a Chinese chicken salad and when I got it was served with the dressing on the side. I ask the young boy to have the chef "toss" my salad. He looked at my like I was crazy. When the salad returned it was exactly the same as when it left -- dry and untossed.   I had to walk up to the cooks area to ask them to "Toss my salad in the dressing"....  Anyway, the whole environment  of this location is off - the flow of the restaurant is weird and I WONT BE BACK ever again.   TOSSING a salad doesn't mean to puke your guts out - It means to toss the salad with the dressing.    Do I really have to explain this?   I guess so...Just a weird experience and weird place.

I just happen to be driving by Corbins and it was super easy to located because of its loud, funky burnt orange color.    Clean, organized with an easy menu where everyone will find something on the menu to eat.  Awesome dirty martina and Pina Colada!   BBQ Baby Back Ribs - Great!  Ahi sandwich that rocked!    We'll be back :)  Great Vibe. Thanks.

Took 5 people in for my partners birthday on a Sunday night at 7:30.  Walked in and the place was like a ghost town.  The worst part - Stale energy - no music - notta.  Just dead.  We had to asked the bartender to turn on and up the music 2 times.  Very frustrating when were there to celebrate my partners birthday.  However, food great.  Service great.  To me Corbin's you are providing an atmosphere not a mediation room.  Please make sure you have music on when your open.  OR did you not want us there?

Not good...tables were not clean, waiter was scattered and they charged me $6.00 for a margarita that was worth $2.00.  I have driven past it numerous times and the outside makes you want to go in - but looks are not always as they seem.  Save your time and money - There are to many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix that are better.  We wont be back.  On a good note - the food was pretty good.  But, there is something wrong with the energy of this place.

I've been going here for many years, very solid, a little random Thai place where I've never left unhappy. It's all about the Thai Love - even their rice is lovely.

Horrid - stay as far away from this place as you can.  Over-priced, bad food overall.....horrid service. I ordered soup and had a lot left - when asked for a to go container was told they did not have soup to go containers.  Since, I was sick it would have been nice to be able to have the soup later .  Told the manager I was disappointed (guy with the long hair) and he told me he didn't care.  Save your money - the waitress did not get a tip this night, which I never do unless it was just the worst - IT was the worst ever.  The whole place has a feeling of being overwhelmed. Again, do no go here.....Bad - Bad - Bad!

Not going back :(    Over priced, small portions.   This may be Northern IItalian food, but really?  Calamari was weird and served with white beans -- ah, not?   Partner order a simple red, meatball pasta and it cost us $19 -- really?  I could feed a family of 4 for less and much, much better.   Order the pork and it was smothered in balsamic reduction and with a goat cheese sauce.  Let it be natural North.    Service was fine. But, that doesn't make me want to go back.    I'd love to show you how to really cook Italian food.  Good Luck but, we won't be back...

Plain and simple.  Service was the worst - Had to ask for refills on water - had to go to the bar to get our table of 8 another drink from the bar.  The waiter disappeared for 15 to 20 minutes at a time - food was cold, portions were very small.  I felt bad because we were celebrating a good friends B-day and it was not a good experience.  To say the least I will never go back.....bye Eddie's!

Stay away from the entree's and go for the appetizers. Happy hour is worth it - service is very good.  Good atmosphere with nice hip music...we like to go here for happy hour but again I have always been disappointed with their entrees.  Wait staff is very chatty and friendly - remember you when you walk in.....Best thing is there Calamari App , great sushi (especially during happy hour) worst thing is the Yaki Soba noodle entree.  We go back on a regular basis...you should too.

Brought my friend in who has a very bad gluten allergy to wheat.  He wanted to try a burger wrapped in romaine lettuce.  YOU REFUSED TO DO A SIMPLE THING AS WRAP A BURGER IN ROMAINE?  You add bread crumbs to your meat patties and bread your french frys in wheat breading?    Walked out because of your unwillingness to bring one piece of romaine lettuce on the side. Drop the attitude - it's not pretty.

This is the way of the future.  Love the easy part... easy to park - easy to navigate through the store.  Your not overwhelmed with giant stores, walking miles to shop, signs blinking in your face.  Fresh - is the best - everything is great.  They have a 50% aisle, which is where I always head when I walk in.  The  problem is a lot of people have figure out the 50% aisle also :(  It is eco-friendly, low-maintence store, low impact on our world, little waste.  Great for a couple who wants great quality food without the price.  Easy to pack up for lunch and off you go - Fresh and Easy!  Things I love there are:  Hummus Organic chips Artichoke tapanade. 50% Aisle   Safeway and Fry's - sorry you lost my dollars to Fresh and Easy! P.S. - How about some Non-Gluten Breads?

Average, needs better seating( more comfy) - drinks average, only had an ice mocha - so their food may be good?    However, do they sweep the floors?  Very, very dirty - the topper was the wooden chairs had dust that settled in the lower seat area - dusting is must and sweeping and sweeping up mid-day is necessary. Probably wont be back....

Not Impressed.  Music way to loud - server was an order taker ....People smoking on the patio (Gross) after waiting for 10 minutes for the Ice Tea we ordered, having smoke drift into my lunges and then struggling to hear the person I was sitting with -- we got up and left.  Yes, it looks charming BUT there is something off about this place.  We wont be back.

If you like to pay homeowners dues and get nothing in return, I would not use this company to manager your properties.  Plants will die because they do not water the plants, and then leave your front yard bare with dead plants in them.  The property manager AMIE had the balls to tell me one time that she thinks I was over-reacting.  Wow!  I don't see how having dead and dying foliage in my front yard is over-reacting.....what am I paying for anyway? They will tow your cars sneakily from 12 - 4 am if you park even in the slightest wrong way.  Using one of slimmest towing companies you will ever encounter - the tow company makes the Saw series  horror  movies look like Disney Land.  Amie Muramoto has a very offensive, degrading, righteous tone when she speaks to you.  So, after I got tired of coming home to a house with dead plants outside feeling shamed and trashy I decided to get proactive.  Instead of complaining, begging and pleading with righteous Amie I just took a trip to Moon Valley Nursery and replaced all my plants on my dime$ (even though they killed them all)  Ready for this?  Righteous Amie has the Gonads to email informing me I will need approval before I could plant new plants!  Wow!  What a mess!  So, there motto is, "Dead plants are better than Alive plants"  Planned Development Services tag line says they are a "World Class Property Management  Company" - I beg to differ.  You are a LOW class property management company.  They are the worse company I have ever experienced.  Run at all costs from this company. And, I am not kidding!  One star is to many stars in this case....could you start allowing us MINUS star systems?  If so, I would rate them  MINUS 500!

The so called world class property management company  "Planned Development Services" is back to their "low class" service.  Again, we have had 2 large beautiful trees die because of the lack of water.  Here is an email I wrote to their world class employee who sits behind a desk and filters complaints, takes our money but does nothing about the problems we have here.    Amie -  What I find most interesting is when there is something broken like a water system.... why don't we move to alternative methods like a "water hose" instead of just letting the beautiful, large gorgeous trees die?  If someone would have knocked on my door or emailed me saying, "Richard, the tree across the street from your house is not receiving water because the irrigation system is broken right now and we have no money to fix it, would you be willing to water the tree with your hose once a week until we get it fixed?"  Hummmm...MIracles would be in-store for Northglen.  What I find most interesting about "PDS" methods is you claim to be a world class property management company, however, I wonder if you have ever experienced world class service?  World class service covers "every little detail"....Humm.....you might want to reclaim your mission statement and I would be more than happy to re-write it for you based on my experience.    I will be contacting someone higher than yourself and HIgher than Maria to discuss these issues.  Because it seems to me you only email and do nothing proactive about the things "Like dying dead trees" which is absolutely annoying.    If you are considering using Planned Development Services run, run, run.......before you know it your community will look like a bomb hit it.   NO stars - again minus 500.

I picked up my little local neighborhood paper and read a great review on this place.  Since, I am a foody and prefer to spend my money in a locally ran restaurant I choose to not make my crab and shrimp capelini, which I had planned on the day before and postpone it till the next night.   We arrive and were greeted by a young high school boy who sat us at a table near the window.  The food seemed diversed and had something for everyone on it.  The waitress tells us that they have only been open for 2 months.  I'm  thinking cool....I choose the 13 north blue burger and a house mojito.  When the burger arrives it was insane and awesome - when the mojito arrives it was truly the nastiest tasting mojito I have ever graced my lips on.  It tasted like soda water with a little ick.  I was looking forward to the taste of rum, sugar mint and the combination of sweetness, refreshing citrus and mint flavors, intended to complement the potent kick of the rum.  I walked it back to the bar because the waitress was texting on her smart phone and did not come back to check on us.  When it returned (supposedly) new and improved it tasted more of the same.  I told the waitress I would pass on the drink all together and move on to my lemon water and amazing burger. I take a bite and try to move on and realize that "Oh, well, maybe I wasn't supposed have to drink tonight"  When all the sudden me and I my companion here loudly the bartender say, " I am not making him another mojito, I know my mojito's rock and are always fucking amazing"; screaming  loud and echoing off the walls of this small little place that was almost empty.    I called the manager over and even though he comp our entire dinner he handled me and my guest like a used car sales person, wheeling and dealing with me to forgive his "Bitching Bartender" for her explosive and reactive outburst. As a person who knows excellent customer service you don't make excuses for your employees who scream cuzz words across the restaurant so everyone can hear them. To say the least we won't be back.    Now, on a good note:  The food we did have was very, very good, however its not hard to make a good burger.  My challenge to you would be to plop down at the bar and have hissy fit drama queen, "Bitchy Bartender" make you one of her "Always fucking rocking perfect mojito's".  And, if you don't like it send it back and watch her react and tell you that you are wrong and she is always right.  It's very interesting.  Steve:  If you believe this is the kind of person you want to work for you, then I am almost 100% sure your doors will be closed with the next 10 months.  Good luck 13 North Grille - you lost my vote and dollars!

Extremely disappointed in this location.  The manager Tiffany Rodriguez treats her employees horrid.  She runs the entire staff through FEAR. I thought Chipotle was a forwarding thinking company by having free ranged meats ect.  But, what I have found out is the manager is incompetent, mean, intolerant and plays with the employees lives using Fear and Manipulation. Tiffany should be fired from this company and my next step is to write a letter to corporate office and include all documentation of the events that have accrued to many of the employees working at this location.  I used to love Chipotle and used to love the taste of the food.  NOW - Chipotle has left a BAD taste in my mouth.  "Food with Integrity" is their mission.  Integrity is honoring the "Whole" meaning the animals who give theirs lives to feed us and more importantly the employees who serve this food.  Tiffany Rodriguez is a very, very, very bad example of integrity. As a business owner myself I would clean house at this location and the first one to be removed would be the fear based, manipulative abusive manager named Tiffany Rodriguez.   Word of Mouth is your best advertisement and I will no longer support this company until I know this manager is retrained or fired.  More importantly, if this is how all Chipotle managers operate then Chipotle is a fraud =  Food and service is a fraud.   Beware consumers...these employees at 16th and Camelback in Phoenix are working out of fear of loosing their jobs.  Sad, Sad, Sad - Chipotle should be ashamed.  Tiffany, my suggestion to you is go get some help, my dear. Karma is a bitch.

Squash - I can see your potential but something was off when we visited you.  My breakfast came out in tours, first the omelet, which was served with raw, uncooked veges and then 2 mins later I received DRY hash browns reminding me of rice crispy's, then 2 minutes later I got  cold toast and then a random weird cookie shows up towards the end. Our water glasses were empty, the server never returned until after I pushed my plate away.  P.S.  I like to have my meal served all at once and with the other diners dining with me. The manager was sitting directly in front of us drinking mimosa's with 2 men talking about catering their event and bringing food to their table to sample your menu.  Did you notice the table behind you was sinking with food, and service.  Unless, I am missing something - I cannot imagine going back.  I left very annoyed and disappointed.

After buying my house in May I realize that I had major roof issues and I knew I had to bite the bullet and have a new roof installed.  I am a very anally retentive person and I would call myself a perfectionist.  I was only going to use a roofing company who did amazing and close to perfect work as I could find. I decided to only use roofing companies who had 5-star reviews and I ended up interviewing and getting quotes from everyone one of them on Yelp. After a 2-week period of interviewing roofing companies one stood way out from the rest - Stell Roofing blew me away from the moment Mike (Owner) walked into my house.   Mike told me he would do an assessment on the roof and would let me know what he found.  After 10-minutes of being on my roof he knocked on my door and ask me if I would come up to the roof.  I climbed the ladder and Mike took me around the roof showing me everything that was wrong with it (No other company did this). He helped me understand the BIGGER picture, showed me things I didn't even know were going on up there. He found holes, patchwork and many things I had no clue that were happening on the roof.    He then looked at me and said, "Listen your roof is in bad shape and we have storms coming in again.  I cannot leave here today knowing what I know about your roof.  Even if you don't hired me to reroof it, I have to patch these areas or I won't be able to sleep at night." Mike did just that!  He went to his truck, got his super special tar and patched every hole and possible issue on the roof. I was blown away and knew instantly that he was the man for the job.  He did not charge me anything to patch the roof and when we got down from the ladder I looked at him and said; you have the job!   "Why" he asked me?  Because you did the right thing and if this is how you do business and care about people and their roofs your the man for the job!   From that point forward Mike became like a friend to me. He called me on a regular basis giving me updates on when they could come out and start the job.  He called me after every rainstorm asking me if everything was ok?   On September 30th Mike and his amazing crew showed up on time at 6:00 am and the work began. It was like a bunch of angels swept in to make everything right.  From the moment it started to the end Mike and his crew supervisor Vince were very respectful, communicated with me every step of the way, cleaned up everyday and always left the yard better than when they started.    He has a tear off crew and then a roofing crew came in behind them.  The roofers were super amazing, anal and perfectionist. I went up several times a day to check on their progress and they were always willing to answer any questions or address any concerns I had.  Mike also called me several times a day to check in with me and make sure all was well.   In the end, I received a Life-Time Owens Corning roof (Estate Grey with black turbines) very unique look that fits my contemporary style.   I cannot stay enough good and amazing things about Stell Roofing and I HIGHLY recommend you use them because you will get what you pay for and will be highly pleased with the end results.   Bravo Stell Roofing I now have Peace and feel Highly Covered!

We have been here twice now.  We were told about it from a friend and we are all about trying new places.  Ok, Food good - thank you for organic and fresh squeezed OJ.    However, your staff lacks personality and they seem to be  "deer in the head lights". There is a difference between a Server and an Order taker. So, far both times we've had Order takers.  "Hi, are you ready?"  Opposed to:  Hello, how are you guys?  Have you been here before?  Let me tell you about our daily specials and let me recommend a few of my favorites. Nope, we got, are you ready? -- both times.  Going to the counter to pay, again no personality, lifeless humans standing there doing a job.    Manager(s), you may want to wander around and do table checks. I can tell you want this place to do well, but, with your LIFELESS staff, it's going to be a stretch to be successful.  I mean --  jeez, even at Denny's we get some personality.    There is no personality here -- zombies, taking orders and doing a "job."  Just because your organic, doesn't mean you need have lifeless attitudes.   Say hi, be fun, enjoy your customers, look people in the eye, check up on tables regularly, and when its time for your NEW Clients to pay their bills --  this is when you should be asking your NEW clientele, "How was your experience?"   We will try your restaurant one more time, but if it's the same next time - No more repeat visits for us.  For those who know good service -- it won't take long for  people to spread the word.  So,  Are you amazing or below average?  You choose.   Right now, Your below average.   I hope you'll take this review and "Step it up!"  Its very fixable right now.    See you next time......I pray you can "step it up" and bring some personality to your service staff. Right now, it's stale.

Need a Break from the rat race of life?  I sure did!    Easy to find location surrounded by wonderful restaurants and daily amenities and plenty of free parking.   The moment I stepped into the Spa I smelled many wonderful smells, lemon water available to you as you wait for your treatment. I was taken into a lovely space where I received a 90 minute massage in a quiet, cool massage room with gorgeous wall art. My therapist told me it was the owners (Stacy's) photo's that she had taken herself.  My massage was very professional and ask my therapist to allow me to go away as I didn't want to talk.  I know I drifted off many times during the massage.  The best part for me was the feet massage the therapist did at the end (my feet are always dry and after she was done they were no more).   Once I finished the 90 minute massage I was told to put on a white fluffy robe and slippers and then taken to my 60 minute facial.  Again beautiful art work on the walls from the owner (nice local touch) and then greeted by a wonderful aesthetician who spent a few minutes asking me clarifying questions about what I wanted to achieve in this facial. She was very personable, talked when I wanted to talk and let me drift away as I needed. My skin absorbed all the yumminess quickly and the therapist told me I had great skin for my age :)   I don't do facials often, but I now know I sure do need more of them!    I spend a wonderful 3 hours in New Serenity Spa and left feeling revived and rested. Thank you for the wonderful find.  I would say the prices are very affordable for what you get and when your done, walk 15 feet to Wild Harvest for a yummy sandwich or salad without the need to get into your car to drive.   I also found out they offer Yoga & Mediation classes - Wow!  Full services one stop shop  What else can you ask for?

Lovely outdoor patio with a nice well rounded menu. Service was good and the waiter was a server, not an order taker. Gave us a verbal tour of the menu and helped us to see other items we didn't see just reading the menu. Both our dishes were amazing - Enchiladas and Salmon. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked and presented. We will be back.
