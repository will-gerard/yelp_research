This place is literally THE BEST place to go for bbq in AZ and even CA. I know, bold statement, but it's truly amazing. I usually get the sampler which includes pork ribs, beef brisket, pulled pork and bbq chicken. You can't go wrong at Joes.

The best dentist I've ever been to. This is my 4th visit and I've gotten just as great of service as each time before. The dental hygienists are super friendly and always in a great mood. They'll ask about your life and tell you stories about theirs.. Definitely not like the usual dentists office. Plus, they will leave you with a goodie bag and some great tips for oral health. Christine assisted me today, and I have to say I think she's my favorite.. But they really are all great! They don't try to up-sell, are experienced at what they do, and always make me feel more comfortable. Also, the office itself is very cute, clean and inviting. I would never stop going to this office if I wasn't leaving the state!

We were really excited to try this place after hearing so much about it online and TV. I got the ahi tuna sandwich with onion rings and my fianc√© got a burger with fries. The food overall was very good. You could tell that the veggies were fresh and the portions were decent. However the place was a little pricey for what it was. $2.50 upcharge to get onion rings instead of fries with my meal? Not worth it. Especially since you get about 5 rings..  And yes, they're good. But like the rest of the food, It didn't blow me away. It was well made American food. That's it. I wouldn't go in expecting the best food you've ever eaten.   I do want to say, the place itself is really cool. Its clean, has great service, and a cute retro look. Plus the restaurant is right on the farm which is a nice walk after a big meal. They also have a coffee shop next door and a farmers market every Wednesday. We'd definitely go back, but id probably try something different, Like one of their fresh salads.

Pros: Clean, great service, good prices, and nice country store with neat stuff to look at. Coca Cola Cake!  Cons: The food was equivalent to Sizzlers salad bar. Even the cornbread was a little dull. It was somewhat dry and flavorless. I expected fried chicken breasts and got some weird boneless chicken leftovers fried with a side of overly sweet syrup. There was an odd taste to the country friend steak and the gravy on the mashed potatoes. Their mac n cheese and hashbrown casserole weren't bad but definitely bland and store bought.   We were pretty let down by the food, but I will say, The Coca Cola chocolate cake was amazing.

The food here is amazing and comes in good portions for cheap prices. It's the first good Chinese food I've found since moving to AZ. There dinner combos come with soup, meat of choice, rice, a huge egg roll, and 2 cream cheese wontons for 10 bucks. I will say, the service is not the best, they try to be nice but rush you through everything and the whole family just hangs out in the dining area as you're eating. kinda weird, but the food is great

I got MRSA from the Phoenix office. Do NOT go here!  I came in for a routine check up on a Monday, and by Wednesday I had two large painful bumps on my back and thigh. At first I thought maybe they were spider bites, until a black hole developed in the center with pus and i started getting body aches, cold sweats and a fever. (Sorry for the details) So I went to the Dr's the following week, where Dr Kostov tested the wounds. She said that it looked like I got bit by a brown recluse (twice?) And put me on antibiotics, but I should wait to get the results back in a week. Eventually I got a call from a women at the front desk who said "oh so the test results came back positive for mrsa, just keep taking the antibiotics".. That was it, no explanation of what it was, nothing about whether I was on the right antibiotics, nada. I then CLEARLY asked if it was contagious and she said no! That same day my fiance came home early because of a large painful bump on his leg. After doing my own research I learned that MRSA is highly contagious and the most common place to get it is from hospitals/doctors offices. So I called back and told the same women at the front desk "I need to know if this is contagious because my fiance is experiencing the same symptoms, and she said oh uhm hold on (on hold) oh yeah, like I told you before it's highly contagious so you shouldn't share sheets, towels ect.. are you kidding me lady? My fiance and I both ended up going to the ER where they said based on my symtoms, I likely got mrsa from the doctors office and my fiance got it from me. (Generally, if your symptoms are very severe, the virus was most likely transmitted from a medical facility) But of course, I'm still responsible to pay for all the medical bills. I just hope they took the right precautions to disinfect the office after learning that at least one of their patients was in there with mrsa.

This place is awesome. Very quaint feel inside, though it's actually pretty big and has plenty of seating. I've been here probably three times, and on every occasion the servers and hosts are super friendly and fast. One of the managers will always stop by your table to say hello! For this round my fiance and I shared the shrimp pesto bruchetta, spaghetti supreme, and 2 cannolis. I forget what the bill was but because we chose an appetizer and dessert with just one entree, the price wasn't bad and it actually filled us up. Actually for an Italian restaurant, Rigatony's is very reasonable. Everything was delicious, especially the fresh bread and salad that comes with. Everything is so fresh, you can definitely taste the difference. Make sure to ask for a stamp card on your next visit. You'll get a free entree after so many meals.

Super good food, I had the pumpkin pancake and french toast, both delicious. The pancake did not have a strong Pumkin taste, very light. The omelets are huge and packed with stuff. Also they're dog friendly, And the server usually brings out a bowl of water and bacon for your pup!
