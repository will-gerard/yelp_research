If you want good Chinese food this is the place to go!  Wong's is right down the road from my work so we go here quite often.  The location is terrible as it is near the airport in the ghetto, the owners of the restaurant live next door as their house is connected to the restaurant.  If you were to drive by this place you would never think to go inside and eat here but trust me, if you do the food is amazing!   Love eating here.

I have been to this restaurant many times & love it!  Great mexican food priced very reasonably.  They have three different areas to this place, an area for dining, an aread for eating outside with a very nice view of the man made lake, & there is a bar area to go enjoy some beers & watch tv.  I took my mom & step dad here when they visited Arizona & they loved it.  Anytime i'm invited out to eat with friends if we are going here I will always go!

I have always been very pleased with this vet.  I have been taking my 1st dog Bubba Gump to them since I've had him.  I got a 2nd dog Chico and took him in for the first time today, everything went great, he had a broke toenail and they fixed him up, put in a microchip and did his heartworm.  My only complaint is I asked about a 20% coupon for first visit on all new clients.  This coupon was rejected since I've been there before.  Personally I would think my PET was the new client and the coupon would have applied.  I don't go to the bet for me, it's for my pets hence he was a new client.  Would have been nice to save the money on the $354 bill.  Otherwise I have no complaints.

The vets at this hospital are really good and they are always helpful and very easy to make an appointment with but they are WAY overpriced!  Which now makes sense as to why it is always so easy to make immediate appointments.  I only use this vet now if I have something I cannot wait for.  I started going to the Anderson Animal Clinic and they are awesome, they always take great care of my dogs and they are more then half the price of Val Vista Animal Hospital.  Only issue I have is it usually takes two weeks before you can get in to see the vet because they stay so busy, but that is due to fair pricing and great care.   Example - I paid $130 for Bubba's rabbies shot at Val Vista and that was for a one year shot. I paid $120 at Anderson Animal Clinic and that was for both my dogs and it was a three year rabbies shot!  That means in a three year period I only had to pay $120 total at Anderson, for both my dogs at Val Vista I would have ended up paying $260 per year for three years equaling $780 total.

Love this place!  Great food, great service, only negative is it is a little overpriced but you pay for what you get.  I have taken a couple of dates here & all went really well.  Also took my parents here when they visited & they loved the place!  Very good southwestern flavored food.  The outdoor seating is awesome, huge waterfall & fireplace during winter.  Inside there is a bar & a dining lounge.  The bar is typically full of neighborhood regulars.  The place has a unique batcave theme, you can make it out when you look around.  The menu is a newspaper which is original & unique.  Definitely recommend this place to any friends wanting to eat a southwestern style meal.

Always a pretty good time at Zipps.  Friendly staff, fun atmosphere, good food, cheap pricing.  The 1000 Island burger is awesome.  Had this with the side salad & then we had a chocalate chip cookie pie that is served on a hot skillet with ice cream on top.  As bad as this is for you the thing taste absolutely amazing!  The only draw back to Zipps is you seat yourself & the majority of the time the place is packed so your forced to walk around a crowded bar looking for somewhere to sit.  Anytime I want to watch a game, relax, & have some good fair priced food this is a definite option.

Absolute worst auto care place I've ever been to in my life!  I have gone to this shop numerous times since it was close to my home & I assumed building a relationship with an automotive place will help to ensure they don't screw you in the future, apparently that is not the case! I went to this place a while back to get an oil change & nothing was wrong with my car at all except they advised I should change my shocks.  So I went back a couple of months later to change the shocks.  This was a $750 job.  When they finished I drove to a detail shop to clean my car & as I pulled in my car just turned off on me.  Spent a few hours trying to jump it & figure out what was wrong & couldn't.  When I called Midas I spoke with MIKE and he told me they couldn't do anything unless I bring the car back.  So I had to pay for a tow truck to take my car back to Midas & of course with it being Sunday they were now closed so I left the car overnight.  The next morning I received a call from MIKE saying that my distributor went out & needed to be replaced, this was due to a "kill switch" going out.  Supposedly my car, which I had for 4 years at this point, had a kill switch installed by the previous owner that I never knew about & the wiring had finally been deteriorated to the point it killed the distributor & shut down my car.  This was ANOTHER $750 to replace.  Had no choice really so had this done.  Seemed very sketchy that my kill switch wire finally went out 3 BLOCKS from the Midas shop.  But I gave them the benefit of the doubt.    A couple of months later (Dec. 2012) I took my car back in because the brakes were making a lot of noise (keep in mind a few years earlier they changed my pads & roaders & I thought I had free lifetime brake warranty, read the fine print!).  I also was having a weird problem where at a complete stop my car was idling low & would drop & it felt like the car was going to die but never did/has.  It would then take a second to get up & go again.  This was really my most cause for concern.  Well after taking my car in & having evaluated MIKE again came out & told me he was sorry to ruin my Sunday but my car had $4000 worth of issues!  Said I needed a new timing belt, exhaust manifold, brake calipers, brake control arms, air conditioning system, and a few other small things.  So at this point I was highly upset & wanted to just take the car & trade it in right then & there & get something new but I could not do that as I was in the middle of buying a home and purchasing a new car would have more than likely made my home loan not go through.  So I told them to just fix all the issues & get the car back to me.  Took them until Tuesday late afternoon & thankfully they were nice enough to bring my car to my work, least they could do after four grand!    Sure as $hit my car to this day is still having the idling issue & I have no intent to take it back to this corrupt auto service place!  I would rather spend more & go somewhere else then ever go back to this place or ever again deal with the sleaze ball MIKE who is a manager there.    To really make things even worse they told me after dropping my car off that I was the "customer of the week" for spending so much money!    I hope that everyone reading this realizes this was not a one time experience.  I went to this Midas 6 or 7 times for services & gave them the benefit of the doubt & trusted their judgement but enough is enough.

Well it is now May 18th.  I was driving down the I60 this evening when my car started getting extremely muggy while the AC was on.  I looked at my gauges and my car was about to overheat.  Then smoke started coming in my AC vent, I went to pull off the freeway and my power steering went out.  Once I was able to park I popped my hood and the timing belt had completely come off my car, unreal!

Absolutely love this place, have never had a bad experience & i've ate here countless times.  Typically I will get the chicken parmgsean sandwich, the bread is soft & thick, chicken is freshly cooked & taste perfect.  I have also had pizza & calzones here & both are absolutely awesome.  Everything in here is italian & fresh, very homely feeling.  This place is always packed & it takes them a little bit of time to bring your food out but it is worth the wait because you can tell it is cooked when you order it.  Would never turn down going to lunch at Defalco's!

This place is amazing!  I eat here all the time & the food is so good, best pizza in Arizona!  Last night I had the spaghetti filled cal-zone & it was delicious & very big.  The waitress was incredibly helpful, polite, & very attentive without over doing it.  This location is very small & somewhat hidden in an industrial area but this is only because this was the first location of this restaurant in Arizona.  If anyone has a chance to ever eat here it is highly recommended you do!

I contacted this company because I am needing to have my roof replaced on my 1050sq ft single level home.  I have been getting quotes around $4,500-5,500 so far and wanted to get as many quotes as possible to make the right choice.  I called Roofing Consultants based off the numerous great reviews they had on yelp.  Well after having them send me a quote I realize now they are the last company I would go through.  Their quote is FAR and AWAY the highest priced one I received, they quoted my roof at $8,025.  This is just a shingle roof, nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary and somehow even though on the phone they said their quote would be "middle of the pack" they came back with one sky high.  I didn't even bother to contact them after because it was so absurd but their sales manager called me to see if I had made a decision.  When I explained to her that their pricing was outrageous and way above every other quote I received she had no response except, thank you for your time.  Typically when a customer complains or advises that your pricing is way over priced a company will at least try to explain their pricing or see if there is something they can do and get back to you.  In this case nope, nothing, just thanks anyways.    I started wondering how they could be in business ripping off people like this and I started looking and I noticed that the majority of their Yelp reviews are from realtors which now makes sense, realtors don't mind paying a higher cost for the roof because it just gets added into the cost of the home anyway and ups their profit when selling the home.  So they trade business, recommendations, and good talk about each others work and the roofing company gets more business and the realtors get higher house sales.    Total ripoff!

This place is the bomb!  Best meatball sub I've ever had in my life.  Cannot tell you how many times I have ate at this place, its very relaxed, great food, & reasonable pricing.  Their brownies & cookies are both very good & they have the softest bread of any sub place I've ever been to.  Will always eat here when suggested & would recommend this place to anyone inquiring.

I really enjoy coming to the Lodge for Sunday football.  Really good food, the mac n cheese is awesome!  The waitresses are very attentive & the bartenders are awesome.  The only think I don't like about this place is the tv's are not very good for Sunday football.  If they had a better tv setup then I wouldn't watch football anywhere else.

Went to the Men's Wearhouse today to purchase suits for an upcoming wedding in February (Friends wedding).  Nicole approached us and was very polite.  She helped us for over the next two hours, she was incredibly knowledgeable and seemed to know better what we wanted then we did.  She never tried to pressure us into anything and accommodated every question and concern we had.  This was my first time in a Mens Wearhouse store and I have to say receiving the kind of service we did from her today will definitely have me coming back the next time I am in need of a new suit!

I love this place!  The service is always extremely friendly, its a quick & easy place to shop & the food is really good.  You can always find coupons online or in the weekly ads in the mail.  Yesterday I went shopping & spent $102.  I had a $3 coupon & when I tried to use it I realized it was expired.  The lady bagging the groceries came over & said oh hold on a sec, she came back & scanned two $8 coupons bringing my total to $84!  She had no reason to do this but did & it saved me some money & was incredibly thoughtful.  Even though this place is a little more expensive than most grocery stores I will always shop here because of the freshness of the food & the awesome staff they have!

I used to go to this car wash every other week.  The staff was friendly, the car wash was pretty good & pricing was in line with most other car washes.  Over the last 6 months the staff has gone down hill & so has the wash quality.  I drive a 2002 Nissan Xterra & I am reasonable with my expectations of going to a car wash.  I realize I will always spend about 30 minutes at home touching up the missed spots as no car wash gets your car clean to the way you like it.  With that said the job they have done is terrible!  I went there this last Saturday, my car was really dirty & covered in dirt so I actually went to a self service carwash prior to going here & I spent $5 spraying down my car & the underbelly so that it wouldn't be as difficult to clean.  When I got to the carwash the first thing the gentleman that approached my car asked was "did you already clean your car" & I explained that I just washed it down but need a full cleaning.  I paid $25 for an upgrade job along with the usual $1 oversize vehicle fee.  When they finished my car I gave a $5 tip & left.  All in all I spent $31 at this car wash.  When I got home & went over my car I was astounded at how much visible dirt there still was on my car.  The door jams looked like they were not even wiped down.  I ended up spending TWO HOURS re-cleaning my car to get it to the level I expect when I am paying $31.    Not to mention when you're waiting for your car they have one couch, a couple table top seats, & two massage chairs that specifically state don't sit here unless paying for a massage.  Seriously....I was shocked the first time I saw they added these chairs.  People are already paying for a service & now your trying to nickle & dime them for more.  This place has gone extremely down hill, I have been a customer there for over 4 years now & I am done.  This was my last car wash & I will find somewhere else to go.  And to make things worse the quality used to be good enough that I lived right across the street & I moved a year ago about 5 miles down the road & yet I continued going here because the service was good, now its not worth my time or effort as a consumer to go here.

I love this place but it is best to go here when your planning on getting trashed.  If your going here sober & staying sober you will be highly annoyed.  NEVER sit in the blonde hair'd bartenders area.  This guy is the WORST bartender I have ever encountered.  He moves at his own slow pace, he is never friendly, takes forever to help, & is just an all around terrible bartender.  One time there I stood at the bar a half hour waiting for him to ask me what i'd like, in that half hour I watched him help multiple people twice before getting around to me, even stopped & picked up his phone to text before coming over to ask what i'd like to drink.  When I confronted him about it he denied texting & I told him I was standing there watching him.  Yesterday I was there sitting at the bar when it was slow & after a half hour of waiting for him to ask what i'd like I stopped a waitress to get service.  When your sitting at a bar you should never have to get a server to help you.  Bartender should be on point.  When I asked him to close out my tab it took him 25 minutes.    Besides this guy the place is really fun.  The chicken tacos are amazing, eat them everytime I go here & the chiros are pretty awesome as well.  Good tv's for watching football & always really hot women.  But like I said, only go there if your getting trashed & avoid that bartender!

I have been to this car wash about 10 times now, couple times I got really good work done but for the most part the work was average and the pricing is in line with most anywhere else.  Yesterday though was by far one of the worst jobs I have ever had done!  I worked all weekend and when I got off Sunday afternoon I went straight from work to the car wash, pulled in at 4:53PM and the first thing I did was asked if they were still open.  Attendee said they closed at 5, I asked if I should come back another day (which I would have been fine with doing if he had said yes) but the guy  said no we can get you done no problem.  They had my car completely done within 10 minutes.  I paid for the VIP and definitely did not get a VIP job done.  I am a very detail orientated person so after every wash once I get home I go over my car and hit any spots that may have been missed.  This usually takes me about 30 minutes so no big deal.   Well last night it took 2.5 hours because the wash job was such crap.  I then knew exactly why my car was in and out so damn fast!  On top of paying for the VIP of course my car is an SUV so you always get charged the extra dollar for "over-sized car" of which I never see an extra $1's worth of work being done.  Anyhow I will not be going back to this car-wash.  I only go there because of the convenience of the location but I think I'll just drive the extra mile to the car-wash down the street from here on out.

Went here because it is right around the block from my house.  Wanted to get some ice cream and their concrete mixers looked really good.  I am a diehard DQ Blizzard fan so I was interested to see how they compared.  Have to say the concrete mixer was WAY better than the DQ Blizzard.  I had a Reese's Chocolate mixer and there was so much more Reese's butter cups in the ice cream than I ever receive at DQ.  The pricing is quite even, the mixer is only about .75 cents more.  Definitely going to start getting these mixers over blizzards when my sweet tooth kicks in.

The food is great but the attention to detail is pathetic!  My first time their I had a chocolate Reese's concrete mixer.  It was amazing!  Been back for it now three more times and all three times my order was wrong!  1st time I received the mixer with Reese's pieces, not Reese's buttercups, 2nd time back added hot fudge and received vanilla ice cream and 3rd time back I received vanilla ice cream with snickers.   So to re-cap;  Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup Received: What I ordered exactly  Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup Received: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Pieces   Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup & hot fudge Received: Vanilla ice cream with Reese's Buttercup & hot fudge  Ordered: Chocolate ice cream with Reese's Buttercup & hot fudge Received: Vanilla ice cream with Snickers & hot fudge  Keep In mind I just started Invisalign as well so my teeth are a little loose so eating the Reese's pieces and the snickers was somewhat difficult.  UPDATE:  Went again May 18th, ordered another Tall Chocolate Reese's buttercup concrete mixer.  What did I get a tall chocolate mixer with NO Reese's, only ice cream.  How difficult is it to get an order correct!!!???

I live around the corner from this place so thought I would try it out and see how it was.  The menu is big with lots of great sounding choices.  Being from Portland there are all kinds of places that make burgers with eggs on them which I love and is hard to find here so I went with the breakfast all day burger, a large onion ring and a large pop to go.  First problem I encountered was the lady told me that the pops are one size only and she gave me a cup that was the equivalent to a 12oz pop and said but you can refill as much as you like.  My first thought here was this is a poor attempt at saving money.  Who wants to refill their pop after every two to three drinks and as a customer ordering to go there was no way this would last my entire meal so this was disappointing.    I felt better about the food when I was given my bag to go, it was literally two bags of food and one looked like a small shopping bag so I thought WOW this is going to be a big burger!  When I got home and sat down to eat my meal with my 12oz pop, I pulled out the burger and it was literally the size of a Wendy's baconater!  I could not believe that a burger called the breakfast all day and stacked full of extras according to the menu was that small.  VERY disappointed to say the least.  The shopping bag of food was the onion rings, there were literally so many that they had to provide this giant bag.  Now don't get me wrong, was it cool to have that many onion rings, yes, but did I want the onion rings to be 75% of my meal, NO.  I am one person, I wanted a big burger, a good size of onion rings, and a nice sized pop to wash it all down.  What I got was a can of pop basically, a Wendy's burger and a serving of onion rings for 3 people.  To make things worse they stamp Burger Fi on your burger.  This would be an okay add for marketing if the burger was big enough to have it fit nicely on top the bun, but the word barely fits hitting both edges of the bun, therefore making it look even smaller than it already is.  All this for $15!  I would have been more filled up after with a Wendy's $7 meal and to be honest it would be almost as good with a pop that would have complemented the meal accordingly.  Needless to say I will not go back and will not recommend this place to anyone.  BTW I don't expect this place to last long considering its location their is MASS Competition.  Directly across the street is a Five Guys, Panda Express, Chipolte, Firehouse Subs, Cappriatti's, Pei Wei and many more.  Dana Park is known for all the good food around so cutting corners to save a penny won't help this new establishment succeed.

Went to Bottled Blonde to watch football today, spent two hours there and had a good time.  Went to another bar to eat, went back to Bottled Blonde and they would not let me in because I was wearing Nike Air Max shoes.  I spent two hours there wearing these shoes and now they won't let me back in, unbelievable!!!  I will NEVER go back to this bar, what a joke, asked for the manager and was told I was talking to the "head door guy", now I know why Scottsdale, AZ is going down hill!

Went to this place for the first time and they are awesome!  The staff is all really  cool and genuinely wants to help you.  The waiting area for your car while its being washed or cared to is great, five big screen tv's with two dedicated to sports and the other three showing the maintenance area and car wash area so you know when to get up and go get your car rather than sitting outside in the 100+ Arizona heat.   If your doing a self carwash you just drive on through and they have free vacuums and they also have a air dryer so you can blow the water off your car to avoid it running down the side and leaving water stains while you drive home.  All in all this is my new carwash place and definitely glad they built this right around the corner from my house.
