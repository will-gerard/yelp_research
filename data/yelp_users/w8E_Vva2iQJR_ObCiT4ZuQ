The place was extremely well lit and nicely decorated. Flavors were amazing and had tons of choices!!! I couldn't even decide! definitely do the text for $1 off. You will get the coupon within 20mins tops. Lots of parking and there's usually lots of people sitting around the area. I will definitely come here again!

Definitely low key, good atmosphere to talk 1-1 or a small group. dim setting = romantic. Prices were reasonable even if not restaurant week. Food was amazing and quick service. Desserts-Tiramisu was to die for! you can taste the coffee and it smelled great!

US airways flight got mechanical issues and we got these hotel vouchers. (Details after hotel review).  Lobby: clean spacious and there are couches. Decent. Lady at counter was nice and quick.   Elevators are past waterfall (yes there is a small waterfall in the hotel to the side -it's very odd.)  Rooms: I got put in a double bedroom. It looks clean from the beginning however if you look at it closely there are weird just colored stains on the sheets.  Bathroom: this part killed it for me I came in to bathroom and I grab a towel in which I found hair on them still. It looks like the maid just re-folded them from prior usage because they looked clean the most part. On the sink, there were smoke smudges of some sort which I do not know where they came from.  This was very gross upon entrance-it looks decent but I'm closer examination hotel was not very clean but I guess what you expect from a free hotel or a two star hotel?   FYI-There's also a gentleman's club across the street making this a very odd location.  *travel voucher-If this happened to you-be careful! There will be hundreds of people in same boat so the shuttle to and from hotel will take forever cause they take 10ppl at a time in 25-30min intervals. Once off flight,  you wait to get the voucher then you have to wait for the hotel shuttle then you have to wait to hotel check-in! so ends up being about 1.5hour by time you get to your hotel room! They put you first flight in the morning so you get about 3-4hr sleep then shuttle back to airport. :/

The service and hosts are super-friendly. I came here with friends and it seemed like they have many regulars since the host and waitresses knew customers by name or remembered something about them = good sign!  The prices were a bit more than what i expected - around $7.50-$8.50 for a regular or specialty pho. I am originally from san diego - this place is decent. The broth isnt as aromatic for what i am used to but pretty good for mesa! The bowls come out big but have a lot of soup rather noodles.  They are generous with their beansprouts & basil. Its conveniently located in mekong plaza so you can do grocery shopping before or after.

Its about $6/sandwich for a full one  The subs are great- soft bread warm and flavorful! Id def go back. Its more than subway but totally worth it! Depending on which type you order it can be a lil greasy. Whats good for take out is that all the veggies can be packaged on side so u dont get a soggy sandwich! Order the chicken!!
