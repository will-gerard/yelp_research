Took the family here for lunch after we hung out at the fair. Thank goodness they saved parking spaces so we could park and eat. Food was amazing, fresh and authentic. I would definitely recommend it!

Well....its 130 and your sign says you're open until 3 today but your door is locked. No closed sign. No lights on. Yelp says you're supposed to be open until 4pm. If I could give you zero stars for wasting my time, I would. Yelpers should call ahead to make sure they aren't closed when they normally are open. The owners should at least put up a sign of they are unable to keep their hours.

I met Dr. McCoy today for some back pain I was having. He took the time to explain to me what was going on inside my body. It's been awhile since any dr. has given me more than 5 minutes time so having Dr. McCoy spend about 30 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with me and explaining the root cause of my back pain was very refreshing. He recommended a plan A and then told me that he didn't need to see me again if everything worked out. Wow...my last Dr. wanted to see me back even if I was fine...which always means more time wasted in a waiting room and a copay only to find out...well..that I'm fine. Dr. McCoy also took the time to explain plan B to me as well. Although if I need to go plan B route, I"ll need to come see him to make sure the Plan A isn't helping. All in all, I have to say that I LOVE University Sports Medicine. You can't find Drs anymore who will take the time to truly explain what's going on. So...thank you Dr. McCoy.  P.S. I have been there in the past to see Alice for my annual exam. She's pretty darn amazing too.

We've been with Moxie Girl for over a month now and so far...so good.  Jacie is an amazing Moxie girl.  I love coming home on my cleaning days...it's nice to have someone I can trust to clean my home. By the way..the cute stickers on the folded toilet paper rolls make me smile :)

Dr. Hooper is caring, professional and treats his patients with respect. He's also really funny :) From my first visit the office staff was attentive and welcoming. I never have to wait long for my appointment - if I wait at all. I can often get in to see Dr. Hooper quickly when I need to and he does an amazing job with my adjustments.  I just doesn't get better than this. I highly recommend him to anyone who needs a good chiropractor.
