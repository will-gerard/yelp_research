Great authentic Chinese food! Will definitely be back. Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's what's inside that counts and it was amazing.

The food was average and the service was terrible. The app came after the entr√©e, really??? Was at a difference location on Wednesday and had a great time, never coming back to this location again.                   Not to mention, it was my birthday and jokingly I asked what's a good bday shot and he looked at me like I was an idiot! I went to the bathroom and my friends asked if I could get something for my birthday he replied "Are you looking for a freebie?" Well he obviously did not check my ID clearly since it was my birthday.  Well thanks Jay that was a great birthday experience!!  Mate you're not much!

Best dental office I've ever been to. Jen was super nice and very thorough in explaining what was going on. I will definitely be back!

I love this place. The staff is very friendly and greet me by my first name each time I go back. The food is awesome too! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone in the Tempe area.

This is a lil gem! Best patio seating for date night. They are known for their chips which were amazing with the recommended dip.   The burgers are also amazing. Will definitely be back!

This place is amazing! I like it better than the other locations. It has a great vibe, lots of games and an awesome food/drink selection. Would recommend for dinner or late night drinks. Thinking about going there for nye this year!
