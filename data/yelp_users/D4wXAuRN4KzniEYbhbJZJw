best burritos in Phoenix, quick, quality that you don't find many places.  If you happen to come on a day that they are making tacos too you have to try them!

Went in to fry's today to buy a new office computer.  Did not need any bells and whistles, and told the salesman that.  He proceeded to sell us into 4 different computers, that were not in stock.  Finally we settled on a computer, and specifically asked, Does this computer have office?  he replied, yes it comes with Microsoft Work and Excel.  After going back to our office and setting it up, the computer does not have office.  When we call into Fry's to talk to them they passed us along to different managers to delay resolving our issues.  Not a pleasant experience, and will not be a return customer.

The search for amazing barbeque in Phoenix is over!  I have driven past the BBQ house for a few months, always wanting to stop and finally did.  Walking in ordering my food, I was reminded of Rudy's, and as I ate my brisket i was throughly impressed.  The brisket is moist and flavorful, the potato salad was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect.  By far the best barbeque in Phoenix, I've already recommended this restaurant to friends and co-workers!

I went to Carlife when I had my check engine light come on.  They called me as soon as they pulled the codes, walked through potential problems and outlined their next steps. They then called me after they completed the next steps, with the problem and a price as well as time estimate. Overall, they have been honest, quick to communicate and affordable. I would definitely return and recommend them to a friend.

Finally tried my local hungry howies expecting the same service that my friends receive at other locations.  It was an extended ordering process with someone that did not know their menu, and asked me to repeat everything I said.  I was told it would be a 45 minute delivery. Delivery took 2 hours.   The food was great, delivery sucked and eventually the manager called and offered the entire thing for free.
