Changed hands in 2011 and promptly went out of business on poor new ownership.  Too bad, the old Brokers was a Scottsdale classic!

I have been a frequent shopper at Puddleduds for many years. The owner is awesome - friendly, helpful, and great attention to detail. The store is well organized and I like having to never worry about the quality of the clothing - she obviously never takes anything with stains, rips, etc. Many items are nearly new, and sometimes brand new with tags. As with any consignment/resale shop, sometimes you can seriously score and other times you might find nothing... so you have to visit frequently.  You'll often find more expensive and high end labels here - many Nordstrom brands/designers, Lucy, Abercrombie, etc. On my last visit I picked up about 3 Abercrombie tanks for my 9 year old, and several Nordstrom tees/tanks for my 6 year old. One was brand new with tags! You won't find anything lower than Gap (no Circo/Target/WalMart).  I've passed down many items of clothing to friends that I've picked up from Puddleduds, and I love the fact that higher quality brands can last through 3-4 kids as long as you take care of it properly!

I brought three girls here, ages 4, 7, and 11.  ALL of the girls really enjoyed the exhibits, in different ways!  My 4 year old really liked the "real" dinosaur shows that go on about every 30 minutes.  It was very cool, and kind of Vegas-like in the quality of presentation and showmanship.  They all enjoyed the technology exhibits, stones, minerals, and critters of the Sonoran Desert, and the gold panning was great!!  Cute little outdoor area.  This is a very fun place that only takes you maybe 2-3 hours max to get through.  I suppose you could spend more time as an adult, but kids just cruise through very superficially.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much we all enjoyed it...  and will definitely return.  If you like the Arizona Science Center (who doesn't?)... this is almost like a mini version of that.  Love it!!!

As soon as I saw Blake B's review, I knew I had to visit Toyama!  I, too, have been a Sushi Brokers regular for about 10 years. During that time, the service has been very hit-or-miss... so I thought it was time to try something new.  Being nervous about trying new sushi places, I thought I would start by looking at reviews before taking a chance.  I'm so glad that we did!  We had a number of different rolls, sushi, and sashimi.  All were super delish and very, very fresh and high quality.  Got heaps and "refills" of fresh ginger, as we seem to consume that as much as the fish!  The Unagi roll (eel) was SOOOO good, as was the Cucumber tuna (not the official name) roll.  But everything we had was fantastic.  Small place, and we sat at the sushi bar and was able to chat and ask questions about what to get. Great service and we'll definitely be returning regularly!

Many after school snacks are found at the Grocery Station. Boars Head sandwiches (can't find those everywhere, and never at corner grocers!) and a good selection of chips, energy bars, beer, etc.   The service is great - fast and friendly. Always a smile and friendly conversation... not some creepy guy behind the counter. What else could you want for a corner grocery shop?   Would be 5 stars if there was a small selection of fresh fruit, veggies, or something like that. That's all that's missing!

Have been eating at Brisam's regularly for years with very consistent results. I like consistency when it comes to food quality and service - especially if they are in my neighborhood. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's easy to take Brisam's for granted sometimes. Not sure why, since the restaurant pickins are slim in this general area of Cave Creek/Tatum Ranch.... so we are lucky to have Brisam's!  We have probably eaten here 50 times in the past 5+ years - so perhaps once a month or so. I don't recall even a single time where our order was wrong, slow, or the food less than very good. The service is always very fast and great for weeknights when we don't want to cook but need decent food and a glass of wine and just go home. Our kids (6 and 9) really like the place too, and the staff is always very friendly with them and I appreciate that.  As other reviewers mentioned, it's sort of a cross between a sports bar and a "normal" midrange restaurant. Pretty contemporary furnishings and low lighting in the evening. If you want a good meal and fast, consistent service, you can't really go wrong with Brisam's!  Rating it 5 stars because it delivers on good food at an appropriate price point for it's class - with consistently good service!

We rescued a 1 year old dog, a German Shorthaired Pointer, in May of 2010 and had her home one night before taking her to Partners for resident training camp / obedience boot camp for dogs. We initially intended to leave her for 2 weeks, and that turned into 4 weeks for several reasons. She is a very, very strong willed purebred Pointer and was neglected by her previous owner - so we ended up with an extraordinarily smart, high energy dog with zero training or socialization (bad combination!) She also had food and toy possession issues, and because we have two small children, it was even more critical that our dog did not display dominant behavior. Even though she was an adult, she wasn't even potty trained when we rescued her. So Partners really had to start from scratch with her.   I believe that our dog's results demonstrate how good Partners Dog Training is for difficult cases or rescue dogs. I waited two years to write this review (she is now about 3 1/2 years old) because her training has just solidified over time, and this is due to the foundation that Partners built and we maintained as owners. EVERYONE who meets our dog is utterly amazed at how well trained she is. It's a daily occurrence that we get praise for how well behaved and sweet she is to everyone. I'm actually worried that someone will steal her, she's that awesome.  She is extremely easy to train now, and we have trained her to do all sorts of goofy stuff just for fun - spin, roll, etc...    Here's a partial list of what our dog can do: Down/stay or sit/stay for very long periods of time (minutes), reliable recall (come!), knows the "wait" command, never food or toy possessive, does not bark or growl at passing dogs (people are seriously impressed by this), very respectful of other dogs upon introduction, walks/runs on a loose leash, and much more. Any weakness she does have is only due to us not being as consistent at reinforcing what she already knows.   She's basically the best family dog we could've ever asked for, and we owe this to the foundation that Partners built!  I just wish more people would rescue adult dogs, because they can be trained to be fantastic family members.

Have been to this Roy's on Flamingo twice, both times with our kids ages 6 and 9. This is one of the only restaurants I can think of that successfully caters to kids but keeps things really sophisticated at the same time. We were here last year for our kids birthday dinner, and had a really special and memorable experience!! They ask for the kids' names when you arrive (or prior) and write their names in chocolate when they serve the souffles (make sure you order the souffle 20 minutes in advance of when you want it!).   They also take a picture and print it out in a frame for you and sign the back, which is a great little memory of the experience. The kids activity books are really cool, too... and are big enough to keep them busy for awhile.  The food is melt in your mouth good. It's seriously fantastic. I had the butterfish both times, because Roy's butterfish is the best. And if you love short ribs - OMG. The short ribs! They are even available on the kids menu, which is awesome. My older daughter got an adult meal (halibut) and really enjoyed it. Did I mention to NOT forget to get the chocolate souffle?  I hate sweet mixed drinks, but really wanted a cocktail before dinner... I explained to our server what I like and she suggested the The "Hapa" Margarita-Martini". It has Fresh Lemon & Lime Juice, Jameson's Irish Whiskey, Grand Marnier & Agave. It is literally the best mixed drink I've ever tasted and am dying to try making it at home! It's perfect.  My only complaint on this past visit is that they served my younger daughter's kids meal way before the adults were served - so we asked them to take it away & bring it back when everyone was served. This is a great place to teach kids to eat like civilized young adults, so serving everyone at the same time makes sense.   I love that Roy's uses OpenTable to book reservations. What a convenience! I wish every restaurant used it. Attention to detail is what a 5 star experience is about, and Roy's delivers on every level!

Very nice location and ambiance on the patio.  Even though it was cold, the heaters keep you toasty warm!  Great views of Bellagio Fountains in the evening and good people watching!    Food was very good, not the best but certainly good.  Two entrees and 2 glasses of bubbly and our bill was only $70.  Good, attentive service and food recommendations.  Can't beat the value!!

Sucky, sucky service lunch service!!  No ice in iced tea, no wasabi, check took forever... waitress was never around.  Crappy.  Food was decent but nothing great... Mediocre sushi.  Glasses looked spotty/dirty.  Not everyone is in Vegas to hang out all day and do shots on a Monday!

For an indoor theme park, Adventuredome is pretty awesome. A place you can go to when it's a 110 degrees outside and enjoy rides? I'm in! Frankly, I don't really understand the 1 and 2 star reviews. It seems like many of the recent ones are for one particular event (Fright Dome). Or maybe it's a case of expectations gone awry? I mean, it's an indoor amusement park (the biggest in the world I believe), but it's not Six Flags, nor does it claim to be!  Don't try to do the math on the wristbands vs tickets. It's basically 4 rides to breakeven. Just get the wristbands and don't stress about it. Witnessing kids crying when the tickets are gone is just unnecessary. Get them the wristbands and let them loose!  Have been here three times over 2 years with my elementary aged kids (ranging from 5 - 9). Twice in mid-summer with 110 degree temps outside. If you come here in summertime, arrive immediately at 10am when the place opens. It's still cool and there are NO lines. Afternoons get hotter inside from crowds and lines are longer. You can expect to do all of the rides with no lines for probably at least the first hour or so.... so get there when it opens!  If your child is around age 6-7 and doesn't hit the 48" mark for the "big rides", it might be a bit disappointing if they are the thrillseeker type. Last summer, my 6 year old was just shy of 48", so it was kind of a bummer, but she still had a really great time on the smaller rides like Frog Hopper (my 9 year old still likes it!) & Road Runner.  The good part is that they measure you one time when you get your wristbands, so you only have to go through the measuring process once.   If you arrive at 10am, you should easily be able to ride most of the rides within a few hours max. My kids usually do a round-robin on one or two rides where they go on them like 5-10 times straight when there are no lines.   About the rides: * The water ride is gone, which is good. Took up a lot of room and who wants to get wet when you're inside? Can't wait to see what they replace it with! * I love coasters, and I really enjoy the coaster here (Canyon Blaster). It's not the most exciting in the world, but still really enjoyable. A fantastic beginning coaster for younger kids! Nice cool air and it goes pretty fast... two loops. My 6 year old went on it about 8 times.  * Disk'O - really fun and lines go pretty quickly because it can seat a lot of riders * Both Happy Feet & Spongebob are not to be missed! * Chaos - Kids thought it was fun, but didn't repeat it * Inverter - Really hurts your legs if you're an adult, and kids weren't too fond either. You could safely skip this one. * Sand Pirate - Classic ship ride. Love it!  Unfortunately, the Sling Shot ride was down for maintenance the day we went. But that one is also a MUST ride!  I would probably eat prior to getting here, the food is just typical processed carnival type fare. Then you have more time to ride anyway.  We don't usually do the games inside the dome, instead go to the Midway in Circus Circus.

Ate here for lunch on a weekday. Parking lot was packed! Although I had been here years prior, I couldn't remember what the bar area looked like, or if it was accommodating for a quick lunch on a weekday. Long bar area with a lot of lone people grabbing lunch, so it was perfect.  Asked for the Gluten Free menu and was pleasantly surprised at the selection! I "think" that they may actually make the GF items in a separate area of the kitchen. Had the caprese salad, and it was delicious. Also had Tomato Gin Soup (House Specialty) Fire roasted tomatoes, cream, mushrooms and smoked bacon. Topped with Tanqueray Gin. Both were delish. Only had iced tea, so the bill came out under $20 bucks.  Can't wait to go back again for dinner and try some other GF options with a nice glass of wine. Thanks to other Yelpers for letting me know about the GF options here... I never would've known!

So I did a ton of research on getting my kids' ears pierced in Arizona - in both the Flagstaff and Phoenix areas... and ended up at HTC. We live in Cave Creek and made the drive to HTC in Tempe, because getting my kids pierced with a gun by some high school kid at the mall was unacceptable. I called HTC and they advised that piercing age was based on the individual piercer, but it seems like age 8 or so is about the right time for the kids to be able to manage aftercare for ear piercings based on the feedback from various piercers there.   We did not book an appointment, and made the chance drive to Tempe for my daughter's 9th birthday, and ended getting her ears pierced by Kevin. My daughter is VERY particular, and very conscientious about taking care of things. She (and I) really appreciated the extra time and care that Kevin took to ensure that her questions were answered,  her ear piercings perfectly aligned & placed, and done in the most professional and sterile environment possible. When other reviewers talk about glove changing, they aren't kidding! This place is WAY more sterile and clinical than your average family doctor's office.  Although my 6 year old wasn't able to get her ears pierced for this birthday, she will be anxiously awaiting her return trip to HTC for her big day too! Kevin made it super special for my 9 year old. The best combination of professionalism + aptitude + clinical environment. NO PIERCING GUNS!   We will refer everyone we know to HTC. Thank you HTC & Kevin!!

What more could you want in a breakfast place? Delicious breakfast food, pancakes, french toast, eggs, and good coffee (hard to come by in this type of restaurant environment)!  Service is very, very fast. We have been coming here 2x per week lately because we drop my older daughter off at choir practice before school and have an hour to kill before the other one gets dropped off. I can't think of a better way to kill time than at Butterfield's.

First, I am so happy to be the first one to review Mathnasium!   My daughter is in 4th grade, but works a minimum of 2 grade levels up in her class (so they do 6th grade math most of the time). Aside from being accelerated, the class she's in doesn't follow the 4th grade (or even 6th grade) math standards. The issue that we have found is that there are gaps in her math knowledge. I think the gaps are due to a combination of continuity issues at her school from grade to grade, as well as not having enough practice on each concept. I also think she tends to rush through the work and make sloppy errors. All of this adds up to bad grades and intense frustration with math. Math is also one of those subjects that it's hard to work on with your child when they are frustrated - it can easily escalate into a negative situation. Enter Mathnasium!  We started Mathnasium approximately 7 weeks ago, and my daughter has went from Ds and Fs on weekly math tests to B's. Yesterday she brought home an A+ perfect score!!   You pay a flat monthly fee and go as often as you want. As with anything else, the more you go, the better the results. For pre-algebra, you go for one hour each session (we go 3x/week). The first half hour you can get homework help and test review, and the second half you work on the proprietary Mathnasium worksheets. The worksheets are designed to work on concepts that are not mastered based on pre-testing when you sign up, and ongoing testing (so, you have to "test" out of each topic from what I understand). If you don't test out, you keep doing the worksheets until you get it down.   My daughter LOVES going to Mathnasium, and her math confidence level has increased dramatically. The tutors there are huge math lovers and do a great job at explaining the concepts and keeping kids from getting frustrated. She usually works with Miles, he is fantastic and can really relate to the kids.   For the past two years, she has complained that she is "bad at math" - which was so sad!  When girls give up on math so early, it can be such a downward spiral into middle and high school. She proclaimed yesterday that, "Integers are SO FUN! Do you love integers too?" If that doesn't demonstrate the effectiveness of Mathnasium, nothing does.   Thank you Mathnasium!!

Got a last minute deal for a one night stay for a spur of the moment trip. Booked solely because of the positive reviews out there for the Platinum. Came here w/ two kids, ages 5 and 8.  PROS: * Nice location, right off the strip behind Bally's... convenient for an "off the strip" location. * Very clean!!   * Nice and quiet since it's a non-gaming hotel. * Rooms are super spacious, kitchens are incredible w/ state of the art appliances. Makes you feel like home. A must if you have kids!!  You could actually make Thanksgiving dinner here if you wanted. Full size fridge/freezer.  * Nice balcony in the Solitaire suite looking out toward the strip (we actually booked the Princess suite, but it wasn't available upon checkin, so they gave us a $20 credit and put us in the Solitaire. It was only one night, so not a huge deal). * Pool was nice, an indoor/outdoor thing... small, but nice and right off the restaurant. * Didn't take very long to get a cab or our car from valet when we were ready to leave. A nice change from the big hotels that are so crowded on Sunday mornings that you wait 2 hours to do anything.  CONS: * DO NOT GO TO THE RESTAURANT. The service in the restaurant was atrocious. Beyond atrocious. It wasn't that the servers weren't trying or friendly, but this place is incredibly mismanaged. We were like the only people here for breakfast, and it still took 45 minutes to get the food out. Even coffee took like 15 minutes after we sat down (again, NOBODY in the place). Then we had to wait another 5 to get creamer!!   The guy who brought our food out had no idea where to put it (by now, there was one other table seated, and he brought the food there instead). The food was ok... nothing to write home about.  Definitely would return to this hotel, just would plan on eating elsewhere!

Superb location a couple of blocks from all the Scottsdale action. We walked to Kazimierz World Wine Bar to start the night, and that is only a couple of easy walking blocks. The hotel itself was really quiet even on a Saturday night. Full kitchen and super clean and nicely updated! Even the bathroom was updated, which was nice considering this is obviously an older hotel. Bed was comfy, couldn't have asked for more.  I debated between this Hyatt and the one across the street (Hyatt Place). I'm really glad I chose this location because the other Hyatt across the street was a loud mob scene coming home at midnight on a Saturday night. I needs my sleep and hate loud hotels with drunk partiers.   Only stayed here one night (so, like a staycation) because we had a friend's birthday party in Old Town and didn't want to drive back to Cave Creek after a night out. In May the rates were nearly as good as a $50 cab ride home! Plus, the hot breakfast in the morning was awesome and a great start to a leisurely Sunday. Will definitely stay here again next time I plan to have a long evening out in old town!

Visited Spur Cross Ranch Conservation Area on a beautiful February Saturday afternoon. This area truly showcases the spectacularness of the Sonoran Desert! Several well marked trails to choose from - depending on how long you intend to hike. We chose to do the Spur Cross trail and turn around after about 1.5 miles since we were with two kids (ages 6 and 9). It wasn't too difficult since we didn't hike all that far.   At the beginning of the trail, there is a box to pay ($3 for adults, free for kids 15 and under) as well as nice 11x14 maps of the area. Signage is great, and everything well marked. There are porta potties available and some shaded picnic benches. We saw some two wild burros (so neat!!), mom & baby, right in the parking lot.   We enjoyed checking out Cave Creek that was flowing. There was a nice little "bridge" to cross the creek, so no boulder hopping required unless you were so inclined.  Huge abundance of cacti and interesting desert landscape - volcanic rocks, limestone outcroppings, washes, etc. Great photo opportunities in this spectacular place. Can't wait to go back and hike the rest of the trails!

Normally I would wait until after more than one visit to write a review. I am a big fan of AJ's in general, and usually visit the one way up in Cave Creek. But I was getting my nails done next door and realized I needed cash for the tip, so I decided to pick up a few things in AJ's and get cash back instead of getting charged for the ATM.   Me: Very happy and content after getting manicured and pedicured next door.... Picked up a couple $25 bottles of wine, and because I was in such a great mood I was going to pick up a couple of secret treats in the bakery for my kids' lunchboxes the next day (first week of school). Walked up to the bakery perusing the delicacies when I heard in an irritated tone of voice, "Is there something you need?" Me, "Yeeeessss (long and drawn out while pondering)..." Then an oh-so-brief pause follows while I decide between creme brulee (will it hold up in a lunchbox?) and chocolate cupcakes. Keep in mind this pause was at MOST 2 seconds.   At this exact moment, another customer walks up behind me. The bakery lady says to me, "Well, if you don't know what you want, I have other customers who need help." OMFG! REALLY???!!! You did NOT just say that to me when I'm holding two $25 bottles of wine and about to embark on two $5 cupcakes?! I mean, my "indecision" was mere moments. Are you the bakery nazi? Am I suddenly in NYC trying to order a slice of pizza at lunch?  Unfortunately, the manicure and pedicure must've softened my sharp wit, because I didn't see it coming and could not even respond to this affront to my great mood. The most I could do was dramatically throw up my hands (with the two bottles of wine in each hand), slam them down near the checkout, and walk out.   I even called the manager, Keith, from the parking lot I was so mad. After being on hold for what seemed like an eternity (6-8 minutes perhaps), I explained what happened. He apologized and said he would talk to her about customer service training. That was it.  I am still mad at myself for letting her get away with that behavior and not causing a scene. I am a great scene-causer when I want to be! Sadly, my kids never got their creme brulee. That, perhaps, is the biggest tragedy of the story. I'm sure it would've held up fine in the lunchboxes :-)

Blech, blech, triple blech.  I live in Tatum Ranch so I have given this place several "tries" as other reviewers seem to have done.  There aren't many restaurants to choose from up here, so you REALLY want to believe that the poor service, food, and drink quality are flukes.  They are not.  This place is not good... nothing redeeming about anything, not the food or the ambiance.  Every time I've been here the food is inconsistent and the cosmos/mixed drinks are TERRIBLE.  They had a good bartender awhile back, but he's gone now and it's really bad.  If this wasn't bad enough, it's expensive too.

Frankly, I'm not sure how service could be worse than at Heart and Soul Cafe.  Heart and Soul?  You've got to be kidding me - this place is seriously lacking in both.  Two visits and never even managed to get food either time.  The food looked promising, and the good reviews (despite the service complaints that other reviewers noted) encouraged us to give this place a second chance.  First visit was in October for lunch sometime after 11am.  We were sitting at a table for at least 20 minutes with nary a glance from a waitress or waiter.  When she finally arrived, we were told that it was still breakfast and they weren't serving lunch... so we bailed because we already had breakfast a few hours prior.  No lunch after 11am?  Annoyed after waiting 20+ minutes to find that out.  Second try a week ago.  Arrived about 10am for breakfast on a Saturday and was directed to a seat by a busboy.  Once again we sat for a minimum of 20 minutes, and I should have been tipped off with what was to come when none of the tables around us even having been served drinks. I did notice the couple next to us with two children absolutely seething when we walked in.  Finally, they gave up waiting for service and left abruptly.  Seeing them walk out the door, someone (the manager I'm assuming) confronted the waitress and asked, "Come on!  Did nobody take care of them?" to which she replied, "I thought so-and-so had that table!"    The waitress then rushes over and throws (yes, THROWS... making noise... incredibly rude) the abandoned silverware and single menu onto our table and stated in a very annoyed tone, "I'll be back with more menus."  Frankly, we're pretty easygoing so I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt and perhaps she would come back with a new attitude after taking a deep breath.  Wrong!   No only did she throw manhandled silverware (remember, there were two kids at the prior table sitting for a long time with nothing to do), wrinkled napkins, and a single menu onto our table - SHE NEVER CAME BACK!  We waited another 5 minutes or so (attempting to share a single menu with 4 people) and she didn't return.     I have to say that this was the most stressful restaurant experience I have ever had.  Will never return and will tell anyone in Cave Creek who will listen what an awful experience I had.

On time, uber-professional, and very thorough - the communication (scheduling and confirmation) was easy.  Brett was a total pro - got a few stains out that were pretty nasty.  My carpets look like new... really really nice work.  I will definitely call back for my tile cleaning and future carpet cleaning.  Great commitment to customer service and very reasonable prices for the quality/thoroughness of the cleaning, thank you!!

D'Lisa is very quick, professional, and friendly.  So far the only service I've had is an eyebrow shaping/wax - they look great!  Not too thin, too thick, just right - the perfect brow that frames your whole face!    The online scheduling is FAB FAB FAB.  Looking forward to actually staying on a brow "schedule"!

I can't believe I hadn't been to Bryan's until now, living in Cave Creek for so long! I'm not one of those people from KC or Texas that go seek out the best BBQ places around - so take my review with a grain of salt that I'm no BBQ expert with opinions on different sauces, etc.  Came here for lunch with two kids and everyone thought the food was really good. I had a plate with chicken and brisket because I'm not a big sandwich person. Everyone at our table loved the chicken the best I think - which is crazy! I tend to frequently get vegan meals, so I'm super excited to try the squash BBQ sandwich... since I love squash and it sounds fantastic from the other reviews.  Kids had pulled pork sandwich and ribs in the children's meals. Daughter didn't care for the ribs - but she's 9 and doesn't like blackened / charred food like every other kid. Other daughter had pulled pork sandwich and was in heaven! I really enjoyed the potato salad - rich with a strong fresh dill flavor. Cowboy beans weren't my favorite, and I love beans, but something about the flavor of cowboy beans doesn't do it for me. Contrary to the other reviews, I thought the fries were fantastic! They weren't soggy at all and very fresh - hard not to eat a lot of them.   Genius are the Wiki Stick packs that they give to kids with children's menus! Never seen them before, and the kids had a good ol' time trying to form cowboys from the wiki sticks (instructions included). Wiki sticks are awesome, not messy, and different from the usual crayons and coloring paper thing - it shows that they actually put some thought into their smaller guests.  Can't wait to go back!

I was posting another review and came across a rather poor review for Brio.  I have been here about 6 times, but have never ordered a real meal.  We are more of the order 6 appetizers and drink a bottle of wine crowd, so I can really only comment on the service, apps, and wine.  Service has ALWAYS been great.  Never had an issue, or a wrong order, anything like that.  Everyone has always been friendly and competent.  The wine list is very good, and I am a wine snob.  Always served at the correct temperature, and nice selection.  The appetizers have always been really good - we especially like the seared scallops, gorgonzola lamb chops, beef carpaccio, and the lobster bisque soup!  Don't let the mediocre reviews here scare you away from trying it... pick a nice night and sit outside on the patio!!

Ok, here we go Cartwright's.   I've been living in Cave Creek for 13 years but  have only have been to Cartwright's a handful of times, including a few happy hours with limited food ordered. In the past couple of months, I've visited Cartwright's 3 times. I've noticed that a few recent reviews are complaining about the newly revamped menu. Since I have no opinion on the prior menu, I can only comment on the current menu and service level, which so far has been excelente!  Today, we celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary with our 9 year old (unexpectedly) in tow. Ha! No problem though, since the kids menu is DIVINE and comes with a nice side of wiki stix. My kids are total food snobs, and I am curious if the "old" menu had this selection of kids food? The new kids menu is perhaps the best "kids menu" I've seen anywhere. And I mean ANYWHERE. Scallops and filets on the kids menu? Are you kidding me? OH YES!!!   The service was totally on point. Waitress was great, offered great personalized suggestions and had intimate knowledge of the menu. The busboy constantly coming around filling waters, checking out the situation.... the service was on par with a 5 star restaurant. My only super minor complaint is that I wish they would've checked on the alcohol situation "just prior" to the entrees being served. This is what elevates a restaurant in my opinion, the timing of the wine/cocktail to the entree. Even excellent restaurants miss this. I quickly flagged down my waitress and got my wine in less than 90 seconds, so all was great. Anytime we needed anything, someone was there. These people know good service.   On the food: I had the diver scallops with crab in a Bearnaise sauce, and it was SO SO SO good and so rich. But, man, it was worth every calorie. Think the old Richardson's in central Phoenix, but better. Hubby had filet with spaghetti squash and potato/corn ravioli in a smoked gorgonzola sauce. We also shared the beet salad, and that was great as well. All were very happy with our choices.   They have a nice wine selection by the bottle, half bottle, and glass. Not super extensive, 25 page wine menu, but perfectly adequate for every wine taste.   The only issue I can see with the recent bad reviews is either, 1. People were accustomed to the "old" menu and just irritated about change (hey, people hate change), or 2. People don't like the new "trendy" food (as it was called in two prior reviews), and just want the old Midwestern steak and potatoes scene (which they still have!) This is Cave Creek, after all, you gotta consider the demographic. Perhaps people just want the old-timey ranch steakhouse back? This is 2016 people, the food is awesome. Deal with the change.   Call me a snob, but "trendy" food combined with good service is a winning combination. This is, by far, one of the best restaurants north of the 101 in the Cave Creek / North Scottsdale / Carefree area. I've been to them all, and Cartwright's is here to stay. Keep it up!!

So we purchased a non-3G iPad right when it came out and we were in and out of the store in 10 minutes... pretty easy and the service was fine.  Never owned an Apple product before, but we own a Managed IT firm where our customers are asking about using an iPad in place of an expensive mobile application for a core product that we sell.  Thought that the iPad's remote desktop apps might be able handle the system ok for our customers who are traveling.  We called the Apple store prior to the 3G release to pick up another one for testing.  The Apple employee promised us that he would hold one for us - which, to his defense, he did.  Problem was that he threatened to sell it to someone else if we didn't show up precisely between 8pm and 9pm the day of the release.  Someone needs to tell that guy (Will?  Bill?) that high pressure sales tactics are passe.  They might work on people trying to buy a used Kia Sorento from Big Bob's car lot on Van Buren, but for a business owner who is considering doing more business with Apple as a core "move forward" direction of a growing company, it was probably not a good move.    We were so frustrated by the Apple employee's slimy tactics to try and strongarm us, that I think Apple's solutions are probably not the right fit for an enterprise environment that needs enterprise service.  Sorry Apple, perhaps this is where you're getting it wrong in the business application arena.

Ate twice at Mozen Bistro for breakfast while staying at the Mandarin. Unfortunately, I am forced to give this place a 1 star rating.  After waiting what seemed like an eternity to be served (greater than 45 minutes), I found a LONG black hair entwined in my Huevos Rancheros. It was beyond disgusting! I have no idea how they didn't see it in there. The eggs were literally stuck to and hanging off the hair when I lifted my fork.   I was absolutely starving and was nearly about to cry at the sight of the hair. When I reported it to our waiter, he apologized and took the plate. While they were preparing a new order, I had to pick off of everyone else's plate because I was so hungry. I grudgingly ate the newly prepared huevos, and only because I was still hungry... otherwise I would have bailed on the whole situation.  This definitely isn't the first hair that I've found in food, but it's pretty disturbing when you find one at a place that charges $12 for a bowl of Cheerios. Mozen is expensive and exclusive. It should be held to a higher standard than iHop when it comes to quality control.   Why the 1 star?   * Hair in food. Probably enough said. * For an insanely overpriced restaurant in an exclusive hotel, I felt that the hair warranted an apology from the restaurant manager or someone in charge. When you make a mistake of this magnitude, it deserves a sincere apology. * They only comped my huevos rancheros on the bill. I felt that was kind of chintzy.  What could have earned a 3 star?  * An apology from management * A more generous compensation than just simply replacing the hair-laden dish with a new one and not charging for it. I probably think the whole bill should have been comped since it was only breakfast and not like a $400 dinner bill. And I was a guest at the hotel.

I live right around the corner from Ari Sushi and have watched Ari with his sign on the corner for a few years now - we finally decided to give it a shot on an evening when we were without the kids. Our first visit was a solid 3 stars - food was very good, fresh, flavorful. But the service. Wow. The service was really, really SLOW.  On this particular night, we were pretty relaxed so it wasn't a huge deal.  Despite the very slow service on our first visit, the food was so good (and close to home) that we decided to give it another try with kids in tow. I figured since it was right around 5pm, we should beat the dinner rush and be in and out pretty quick. It was the first day of school, so it had been a long day already. Thinking maybe the first time was a fluke...  Our second experience could be one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in my lifetime (no exaggeration!)  We ordered 2 rolls, miso soup, and 2 teriyaki chicken bento boxes for the kids. We arrived at 5pm, by 6pm we had been delivered the two rolls but no bento boxes. We asked the waiter, "are the bento boxes coming?" Waiter: blank stare, "Um, yeah, let me check on that for you." Returns 10 minutes later and states that our bento boxes were given to another table (I believe this was untrue and he simply forgot to place the order). Ok, it's now 6:15 and one of the kids starts to get really upset because she is quite hungry. Waiter states that they just need to grill the chicken and it will be maybe 5-10 minutes. 15 minutes pass, waiter comes back and states that the kitchen is backed up and it should be out in "5 minutes". Waiter states that he will talk to the manager about crediting us for the bento boxes.  Fifteen minutes pass again, so it is now 6:45 and I've been lied to repeatedly about the time to wait for the kids' food for the past 45 minutes. By 7pm, we get the bento boxes to go because the kids are total basketcases and we can't sit there any longer. At the end of this heinously awful experience, we were presented with a $70 check (no credit for the bento boxes as suggested earlier) and a coupon for $10 off our next $30 purchase.   The best part is that the bento boxes that we waited an hour for (after we told them they were missing) were PITIFUL! There were like 7 bite size pieces of grilled chicken in teriyaki sauce - something that could NOT have taken more than 5 minutes to cook on a grill. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound. You can see a photo of the infamous bento box in the photos here.  $70 to get lied to for two hours, ruin the first day of school, and end up with a crappy dinner to take home. Wow, thanks Ari. Way to take care of the locals.  Frankly, had they just owned up to the problem with a sincere apology and - at minimum - a partial bill credit,  I wouldn't have written this review. Being repeatedly strung along with "it'll just be 5 more minutes" claims for an hour was utterly unacceptable.

I first reviewed Ari Sushi a year ago and definitely did not have a good experience. Since I hate giving 1 star reviews, and love supporting local businesses, I recently revisited Ari Sushi on three separate occasions in order to try and update my original review.    On the service: On all 3 recent occasions, the service was incredibly fast and efficient. On my last visit, our waiter was super friendly and offered suggestions on sushi and rolls,  was constantly checking on us, and the food arrived very quickly. There weren't that many people in the restaurant on any of our visits, so I'm not sure how a "busy night" affects the service levels there now. All of our visits were in the summer, so I'm sure it's much slower than it usually is in the fall/winter.  On the food: As I indicated in my first review, the food was great and is still great! I find the sushi, rolls, and bowls to be flavorful, fresh, and consistently good on all 3 recent visits. The rolls are as good as the best sushi places I've been to anywhere. The atmosphere is just a casual, strip mall type of environment... so it's a pleasant surprise to have such a great meal there. It's a good spot for a casual family meal, or happy hour with friends in a laid back atmosphere. I actually think they could "spice" up the music a bit to make the place a little hipper feeling to emulate some of the environmental influences in Scottsdale sushi joints :-) Music makes everything taste better and keeps people relaxed!  Happy to see that Ari Sushi seems to have really improved its efficiency and service. Better service, combined with a great product makes this place is definitely worthy of a visit! Clearly, this is a great example of how the owners obviously have been reading the reviews and using them to improve service levels. That's what Yelp is all about! :-)

Ramon has been my hairdresser since I moved to Arizona in 2000.  I spotted a girl with a fab blonde bob and asked her where she got her hair cut.  Since then I've been through tons of different hairstyles, colors, and lengths... my hair always looks terrific.  Ramon's extensions are AMAZING.  They don't even look like extensions - and I can spot them from a mile away.  The location is great, across from Dos Gringos... and the restaurant next door is starting to offer a special menu just for the clients at the salon.  It's also nice that they are on the cutting edge of hair products - I want to try the new Moroccan Oil treatments too.

My husband now have our weekly breakfast at Benedict's after using a Yelp deal on a whim when we were hungry. Honestly, this is an example of how effective a daily deal (Groupon, Yelp, whatever) can be in generating repeat customers if you a truly a great business! The food is exceptional. The place is very, very small and it's obvious that they cater to their customers and that comes first. My kids love the crepes, hubby loves the breakfast burrito. The service is consistently attentive and fantastic. For a little tiny strip mall place in Scottdale/Phoenix, you absolutely cannot beat the quality of the food and experience!!

My children and I have been going to Desert Ridge Family Physicians since they opened - maybe 6 years or so.  My youngest has went here since birth.  I feel like they get MUCH better care than the revolving door pediatric offices I've been to.  I felt compelled to write a review after noticing the poor review here when I was looking up the office phone number.  This practice is leaps and bounds ahead of other physician practices in terms of quality of patient care, ease of making appointments, the online patient portal, follow up, in office diagnostics (simple tests all done here... no outside lab necessary unless results inconclusive), and appointment wait time.    Over the years we have been afflicted with some very strange illnesses - some of which were pretty frightening.  Up until I started coming here, I didn't have great experiences with other primary care docs in terms of accuracy in diagnosing illnesses and frankly have been shocked at how knowledgeable these docs are.  Ok, so I thought about all of the PROs coming to DRFP:  1.  Same day/next day appointments ALWAYS.  Always get the care when you need it.... not 3 weeks later. 2.  Patient portal and overall technology in the office 3.  FAST ePrescribing to my pharmacy.  Last rX I needed was transmitted electronically and Walgreens had it ready and waiting when I was leaving my appointment (checked email on my phone) so I picked it up on my way home without having to go back and forth. 4.  Great follow up care (calling to see how you're feeling, etc.), and doctors spend the necessary time with you to really understand the problem and offer options.  They do NOT rush you through appointments - which is so rare these days. 5.  They don't overprescribe antibiotics for viral infections (which most other docs still will just because patients don't want to walk out empty handed) !!  So, if you're a antibiotic junkie, probably don't bother going here. 6.  Great location by Desert Ridge, very clean office. 7.  They can do all kinds of tests in the office... cholesterol, urinalysis, blood tests, etc... that many times you would have to visit a lab separately. 8.  I've always found that they take the most "holistic" path to healing, again, as opposed to overprescribing.  Getting to the root of the problem. 9.  The rare 1-2 times I've had to call after hours, I got a return call almost immediately. 10. Online patient portal to request refills, appointments, email the doc, etc.  In all the years I've been coming here, I have nothing but good things to say about the docs, the medical assistants, and the entire staff.  I only wish every physician practice was run as professionally and efficiently as this one.

I am the assigned "car negotiator" of my entire family - so I went out and shopped Hyundai dealerships looking for a new Elantra on behalf of my mom. I saw the Yelp reviews and how atrocious they were - so I was hoping to actually give these guys a good review because my deals are usually fast and straightforward. I'm crystal clear on exactly what I want and I'm always a serious buyer that WILL buy a car. Let me say that this was - BY FAR - the worst car dealership experience I've had in the past 10 years buying new cars on behalf of everyone in my family (so 10+ cars, let's say). In a past life, I used to sell cars, so I know a thing or two about the process.  Any reputational gains that the auto industry may have gained in the past decade get decimated when unethical dealers like Chapman Hyundai in Scottsdale are running around trying to pull scams on serious buyers. Unfortunately, these dudes completely confirm every negative stereotype of car dealers. Car dealers LIE! Yep, these guys lied. Car dealers SCAM. Yep, these dudes tried to pull a scam. Frankly, I'll never shop Chapman dealers period for any future vehicle for my family - in my eyes they are done. This isn't my first poor experience with a Chapman dealer, but it certainly was my last.  This is how it went down.... I requested out-the-door quotes for a 2013 Elantra Limited from about 6 valley dealers on the vehicle I wanted (I gave them exact specs and color options). Told them to give me their best deal and we would make a decision and take delivery the following day. Chapman Scottsdale Internet Sales Manager (whom shall remain nameless, because I kind of think the guy is just a pawn in the unethical leadership of this dealership... I could be wrong. He could be the biggest scammer of them all.) gave me the best out the door price, so we went down to sign the papers and take delivery on the car. I had an itemized quote in WRITING as well as pics of interior & exterior. I told him that I was taking off from work, picking up my mom, and made an appointment to head to South Scottsdale (a 45 minute drive for me!) to finalize the deal. He PROMISED everything would go smoothly and it would be done quickly. His mom must've not told him that you shouldn't make promises that you can't keep.  First Problem: The Elantra Limited that we came to purchase had a fairly large dent on one of the doors! Nameless sales guy (NSM) profusely apologizes, says the car washing guys did it just a short while before we arrived. Ok. Well, no way are we doing paperwork or taking delivery on a new car with a huge dent. We ask NSM what other Elantra Ltds they have - and he brings out an exact replica with different color interior. We say that the "replacement" car was fine, it was our 2nd alternate choice anyway. NSM says the pricing is exactly the same because it's the same car. We've found this to be consistently true across Hyundai dealerships - they have much fewer add on options and price differentials at a particular trim level than say, a BMW does... so they just quote on the model, trim + options and not on any one particular vehicle. So a little hiccup, but we're still on the right track.  Second Problem: We head back inside to do the deal on the replacement car. NSM has me verify/sign off on his itemized quote that we agreed on via email. Going well so far... numbers were an exact match. Then we WAIT, for perhaps 30 minutes. What's taking so long? NSM guy comes back, says he made a HUGE mistake and has terrible news - that the pricing he gave me was for an Elantra GLS, not a Limited. States that it was his mistake and he's SO sorry and feels terrible.   The MSRP difference between the GLS and the Limited is OVER $3000! That is not a mistake. That is a pretty classic bait-and-switch scam. I'm not really sure what they thought that we would say? "Ok, we'll pay an additional $3k over what you told me for the Limited."? Or, well, we'll just take the GLS? I guess the scam works on a lot of people, otherwise they wouldn't still be doing it.  So we walked out with no car, and about 4 hours of wasted time and energy. I HATE BEING SCAMMED. I am a straightforward customer, and I expect to be treated with a little respect. My time is valuable, which is why I handle most initial negotiations via phone/email.   Sadly, I can say that as far as Chapman Hyundai is concerned - you've been warned. All the other dealers even told me that Chapman is known for the bait-and-switch. I enjoy giving companies &  people the benefit of the doubt and silencing the naysayers. I was looking forward to writing a great review about my mom's awesome new car and our great buying experience.   All I can say now is, "RUN, RUN, as fast as you can... to any other dealer but CHAPMAN!!!"

Have gotten several manis and pedis from Cari - she is a pro! She is very thorough and the place is cozy and very clean and professional. A HUGE difference between Polished & most nail salons in Scottsdale is the sanitation & cleanliness. I have known way too many people who have gotten nail fungus from the jet foot spas that are used in most salons.   Just when I was at Polished the last time, a girl was next to me who had been getting pedis at other salons & had fungus on 3 of her toenails. Yuck. In addition, Polished is no more expensive than the other places. I am pre-scheduling every 2 or 3 weeks so I don't have to panic at the state of my nails & end up at one of those nail mills out of sheer desperation at the gross-ness of my nails.  Polished also has WAY better color selection & all the newest trendy colors. I have gotten tons of compliments on my last taupey grey gel mani and blue sparkly one!

Wow. Just wow. This place is addicting and has an absolutely insane selection of clothing. Prepare to spend hours here if you have the time - pick out professional clothes, casual clothes, beachwear, or night-on-the-town stuff. You could find something here if you are 20 or 80, it's that diverse.   I recently went to Hawaii in the fall shopping season (read: NO DRESSES ANYWHERE). I found three ridiculously cute, designer sundresses that I wouldn't have been able to find even at Nordstrom. Speaking of prices and brands - you're looking at a little higher end stuff here. Many Nordstrom type of brands (Splendid, Ella Moss, etc.)   Mom and daughter own/run the store and they really bend over backwards to try and pick out clothing that meets your needs. This is a good thing - it would be very difficult to comb through all of the clothes yourself.... it's a good sized store with a TON of clothing.   Great selection of jewelry, gifts (think candles and wine related stuff), fake engagement rings (I picked up a beautiful and very realistic looking one for a Central America trip!), earrings, etc. They also have these awesome bra things that are soooo comfortable and come in a ton of different colors, where you can do the "racerback" look that appears to be a camisole. Hard to explain, but I could probably use one in every color I wear them so often now.  Fantastic service, handpicked stuff (that's always new, current!), locally owned - I am a huge fan and thankful to have a local place to shop!

I have been shopping all over the valley for furniture for a cabin, and stopped in here to check it out. I was astonished at the prices. I was at a furniture store yesterday near Scottsdale/Mayo and was very interested in a coffee table there for $599. Walked into Land of Aahs today and spotted the IDENTICAL table. I just to be sure, I compared the table to the pic I snapped yesterday at the other store. Land of Aahs had the table priced at $999!! Almost double of what it costs new just a few miles away! So, unless you like to pay a nearly 200% markup for used furniture, I would steer clear.

Came here on a Saturday early afternoon with two kids, ages 6 and 9. Didn't need a reservation because I think it only gets crowded in the late afternoon/evening. This is NOT 1980s bowling, people! Talk about posh, modern, clean, and awesome. It has a warm vibe, probably because it's pretty small. Great music, not overly loud. I will never look at bowling the same again! The "bumpers" for kids come up automatically for the kids' frames, which is pretty cool.    Ordered some food for lunch that they serve right at your lane. Chicken pillows (basically chicken won tons), small burger slider things, a turkey club (with an egg in it! Love it!), and the gluten free green chile tacos. We all LOVED everything. The food is pretty great for "sports bar" type of food, but especially for a bowling alley. Had a couple of beers and wine, pretty good selection for both wine & beer.   Played in the really upscale, modern arcade after bowling. It was empty, so that was great compared to the usual Peter Piper grossness/overcrowdedness of the weekends. I would happily pay more money to bowl, eat, and play games in style!!   The best part probably is the free photo booth thing where you can put in your email address and it mails the photos to you. The photos are great - they are surprisingly high resolution for a free photo station. We captured a fantastic family photo that will be a great memory of our first time at Lucky Strike! It definitely won't be our last. Can't wait to have a kid party or adults night out here.  The staff was really helpful and the waitress was always coming back to our lane to check on us. Places like Lucky Strike remind me why I'm happy to be a Phoenician!

My family and I are regulars at Amaro, and thought it was time to finally give them a proper review. I would say that I've eaten here perhaps 25 times over the past couple of years. Amaro has consistently good service, consistently good food, and that is what I look for in a neighborhood restaurant. Some of the specials I've had (recently, a pretty bland sounding chicken dish) have been knock-it-out-of-the-park good. The chicken was superb!   Typically, I get the surf and turf, salmon, or pork entrees. All very good, very flavorful, and well prepared. Decent wine list and really nice bar area that unfortunately I haven't hung out in nearly enough because I'm always with the kids when I come here.  Love the live musician on the weekends!! It's a great, relaxing way to get the weekend started on a Friday night. Kids love Amaro too.  The service is consistently fabulous, and it's a great spot that I'm thankful to have in the area. My only suggestion would be to change up the main menu occasionally for us regulars who come in here a lot and run out of things to try. I don't really go for the gnocci (the standard special), and I love to try new dishes... I honestly would come even more frequently if the menu were changed more often.

I finally stopped in True Food Kitchen for a quick bite to eat with 2 kids. I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole (I love spaghetti squash) and the kids ordered teriyaki chicken bowl and ravioli. I really liked my spaghetti squash - just right portion size and very tasty. The kids teriyaki bowl with quinoa was excellent!! The ravioli was a bit small portion-wise, and wasn't as appealing as the teriyaki, but still good.  The service was fast and friendly and the food came out very quickly - which we appreciated since we were on a tight schedule. We were here at 4pm though, so there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. Nice atmosphere, and the patio was lovely (although we didn't sit out there because it was August). The bill was $30, which seems a bit steep considering I didn't have anything but water. I guess that's what you pay in Scottsdale Quarter for fresh, organic food though. Still, it just seems a bit overpriced.

Have used Arizona cleanPROS twice in the past month or so and have been extremely happy with the service provided and attention to detail. I have used a lot of individuals and cleaning companies in the past - and inevitably the quality of the service declines over time, or they show up late (or not at all!), or just aren't thorough enough. I feel like my house is very clean when they leave - and that "clean" feeling stays for a long time! I hate it when you hire a cleaning company and the house feels gross the next day... definitely not the case w/ Arizona cleanpros.    This company is definitely the best I've used in the valley in the past 10 years. They sent two people in a branded company vehicle both times, and they showed up promptly on time and are very pleasant . The service is a bit more expensive than the "competition" I think - $150 for a 4br/2ba 2200SF house (they charge hourly, so if your house is dirtier or cleaner that would change the price). In the past I've paid between $80 - $120.  The quality of the service is substantially better and I feel that justifies the additional cost. If you've tried other cleaning companies only to be disappointed, I would definitely give this company a shot.

I've had a consistently good experience at Upper Crust and would definitely say that it's the best pizza place in the North Phoenix area. Plus, it's super convenient right off the 101 and Cave Creek Rd. Many days I call in or order a pizza or wings or whatever to pick up on my way home since there just aren't many options up in Cave Creek.  Just blew my non-gluten-free friend away with upper crust gluten free pizza! Also a bottle of Rambauer chardonnay half off (on Wednesdays)?! Yes!  They have a pretty good variety of gluten free options if you're into that - but I don't know how good they are about cross contamination. Since I'm just gluten sensitive I don't really need to worry about that.  The restaurant is split into the bar area and the sit down restaurant, so you can choose your experience. The bar area gets pretty crowded for happy hour! But the restaurant is completely fine if you have kids. There's even a pretty nice outdoor patio area (really nice if you consider this is like a strip mall) for great Arizona evenings.   Great wine selection, pizza, appetizers, location, service... and a cool atmosphere - what else could you want? I've found the service in both the bar and restaurant to always be fantastic. They also make their own Sangria if you're into that. Personally, I do the sparkling wine splits when I'm alone. But I like a little fancy in my day.

I don't get it. First time at the Arrogant Butcher and was not impressed. I feel like it's a trendier version of Chile's. I guess my mistake was ordering the scallops instead of something easier and more mainstream like pasta or a burger. I even asked about the scallops and how they were and waitress assured me they were great. They were nearly inedible and I only ate about half of a very tiny plate. They came with very old, wilted, yellowed parsley on top that I would've thrown away had it been in my fridge. The scallops came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes which were SO SALTY and made the whole dish very unbalanced. It just is the wrong combination for scallops, and was a huge expensive fail. I probably should've sent it back, but I just wanted to get out of there and go home after a long week.   I tasted my husband's fries and they were disgusting! They tasted stale and old, and just plain nasty. Probably the worst fries I've ever tasted. My daughter's mushroom pasta was very nice though, and I dipped my scallops into her leftover cream mushroom sauce so that I didn't leave hungry.  The Laguna Chardonnay was really nice though, and not sure I've had it before. Service was ok in terms of speed, but I didn't encounter anyone particularly friendly. Not rude, just not welcoming.   We were considering having a large company holiday event here, but it's off the list now as I would not trust the food quality.

I am sort of a freak when it comes to dentists. I was crossing my fingers that the Yelp community was steering me in the right direction with Dr. McAdams. I'm so glad that I trusted the reviews! I felt like Dr. McAdams and the staff really empathizes with the "dentist panic" that a lot of people have, and are sincerely concerned about ensuring patient comfort throughout the process. Even routine cleanings stress me out, and I was overdue because my prior dentist left the state. On both of my appointments, I had no wait... and on the second appointment Dr. McAdams just took me back right away. On my first appointment, the hygienist did a great job on the cleaning and ensured that reducing any pain due to my sensitivity was a top priority. She even cleaned my teeth manually because the electric plaque remover (I have no idea what it's called) makes me crazy.  I went back for a second visit to replace a couple of old fillings and found the process to be completely PAIN FREE! I'm one of those people who take a long time and lots of Lidocaine to get numb, which has frustrated other dentists in the past... which just made me more nervous. Dr. McAdams has an easygoing personality and is very patient and calm, and he is very attentive to his patient's pain level and state of mind. He mentioned more than once that patient comfort is his top priority - and it shows!!  He also brushed on a new product that is supposed to reduce sensitivity for 1-2 years, so I'm pretty excited about how that's going to turn out. I have some pain even when brushing my teeth due to gum erosion, and already have noticed an immediate improvement in the sensitivity of my teeth after he applied the product. I would recommend Dr. McAdams to anyone, but especially those who are nervous about going to the dentist or who have not been seeing a dentist regularly. You'll be in good company with the rest of us!

Drove through the parking lot and decided to "take a chance" and not look at the reviews. Sat a dirty table with a frenetic, attitudy-waitress who informed us that she was the only one there and it's going to be slow. Not even apologetic, more like a "sucks for you that I'm the only one here, deal with it!" kind of thing. The entrees were quite expensive for the dated pizza joint decor, topped with the notion that we would probably never eat (based on her warning... Sat there 10 minutes without a glance), we left without ordering. Never even got water, but the place was just depressing and I couldn't imagine spending a dinner there.

Just completed the 21 day challenge today, and I've been dying to write this review! I walked in 21 days ago, intending to just grab a healthy lunch after a friend told me about My Fit Foods. It took me about 5 minutes to be sold on the food (it's stuff I would normally eat anyway!), so I decided to press the easy button and sign up with Molly. This was probably the best decision of my life.   I am reasonably fit, not considered overweight, and was hoping to lose only 8 lbs. so my clothes would fit better. I have struggled with blood sugar issues, adult acne, sluggishness, and anxiety my whole life but it had gotten particularly bad in the past 6 months. So you could say that I was meant to walk into this place when I did.  On the 21 day challenge, you eat 3 meals a day plus 2 snacks so you are NEVER hungry. At least I wasn't. In fact, it's quite an adjustment to eat on a 3 hour schedule consistently. There were two times where I had to be away from a microwave or whatever for dinner, so I heated up my meals hours earlier and put them in a thermos. I did this for the turkey chili and happily gobbled it up at NYPD while my family chowed down on pizza.  I found the food to be quite tasty, and much of it spicy which I like. I could eat this food the rest of my life and not feel like I'm missing out. But again, I was a pretty healthy eater to begin with.  My results from the 21 day challenge:  * I had really bad caffeine withdrawals the first 5-7 days (no caffeine or alcohol on the plan), not fun. Might want to pare down the caffeine slowly prior to embarking on the 21 day challenge. No alcohol wasn't an issue for me, I just drank caffeine free tea. * I lost 6.5 lbs, my goal was 8. This was my fault though, because my cheat meals (you are permitted 1 per week) were way overboard. One of them I did a full-on tasting and wine pairing (remember, you're not supposed to drink alcohol for the 21 days!)  I'm just going to continue for a couple more days until I get to my goal. * My nasal allergies totally stopped. I've had TWO sinus surgeries for chronic sinusitis. This was totally crazy and unexpected, and makes me think that I have food allergies or sensitivities that I need to get tested. I shudder to think I could've avoided two sinus surgeries in 5 years by changing my diet. * My acne is GONE. Totally gone. I wonder if it was the dairy I was drinking/eating before?  * My shakiness, night sweats, anxiety, and heart palpitations related to blood sugar fluctuations are completely gone. * I am WAY calmer with my kids! I really think the caffeine increased my cortisol/stress hormone levels through the roof. You don't realize how dependent you are until you go through withdrawals. * This is probably the strangest one and too-much-information, but my PMS disappeared too. I searched diet changes & PMS and found that everything that is suggested to ease PMS symptoms are in this diet (reduce caffeine, low fat diet, keep blood sugar stable, take B vitamins). It never even occurred to me that diet & PMS were related. * I wake up in a good mood and ready to start the day. I have never been a morning person, especially without caffeine. I am addicted to the Fit Foods morning drink (cranberry juice, water, 1/2 squeezed lemon, 1-2 oz liquid B-12, apple cider vinegar). I will drink it the rest of my life!  I can't thank you enough Molly & My Fit Foods!

What a find!! Sol, you make me so happy. Came here on a Sunday on a whim for lunch, and much to my surprise they had brunch from 10am - 3pm. I am a sucker for huevos rancheros, and the claim on the menu, "the best huevos in town" had me drooling.   But, on this particular day I couldn't help ordering the Crab & Shrimp Cakes "Benedicto". Two HUGE crisp-fried crab & shrimp cakes topped with poached eggs & chipotle-orange hollandaise sauce, double-smoked bacon, avocado & refried black beans. RIDICULOUSLY good!! Kids (ages 6 and 9) ordered bean & cheese burritos. Everything was fantastic.   Our waitress was terrific, and really allowed the kids to pick exactly what they wanted and even offered to let them "assemble" them. Very cute and appreciated. Service was fast, efficient, and friendly.  Washed it down with a glass of sparkling wine. Live music in the background. Yes, I best believe this was the best unexpected 2pm Sunday brunch I've ever had!! I could definitely make this a habit.  I cannot wait to head back for some happy hours and the huevos!! Great addition to one of my favorite spots around - Scottsdale Quarter. Man, I love this town.

Also found I Clean Carpets on Yelp. I love the idea that the smallest businesses can get serious traction on Yelp by delivering exceptional service. Rob, the owner, answered the phone and set the appointment for a few days later. He called while en route (as promised) and arrived on time. The price he quoted was what I paid - about half the price of the competition. Now for the nitty gritty on the attention to detail that makes me swoon:  I have about 700 square feet of carpet - 3 bedrooms and a combined living/dining area. The carpeting I have is about 7 years old but was in pretty bad shape. Lots of stains and general traffic dirt/wear. We have a large dog and kids, and for some reason the carpet situation has escalated out of control even though I have them regularly cleaned. I now see that the problem was that I had been using Chem Dry. I noticed in the past 2 years with Chem Dry cleanings that the carpets just didn't seem to be getting clean anymore! When the carpets were newer, it wasn't as obvious that the Chem Dry system is simply inferior to traditional carpet cleaning by professionals who know what they're doing. Rob explained why my carpets weren't getting clean - and how the oil from the dog's coat/skin attracts dirt... and what to do for various types of stains (red wine, mustard, etc.). The mini carpet tutorial was great! He also left a free bottle of stain treatment before he left, which is a great customer service touch.  I have had one particularly large stain in the middle of the room for about 2 years. I never knew what it was - glue, paint, something that kids spilled? Chem Dry people worked on it over multiple visits (and charged me extra), but basically said I had to have the carpet replaced (6 year old carpet!) because it was a "chemical burn". Huh? Rob took one look at that stain and said, "no problem". The stain is COMPLETELY gone! I seriously thought I was going to have to replace that carpeting.... and I didn't have to pay a penny more for stain removal!  He is definitely not a hardcore upseller - everything that other companies charge extra for is included (pre-conditioner, stain treatment, etc.). I did have him optionally "scotch guard" the whole house for $50 since all of the original scotch guard was gone. I felt this was a very reasonable price compared to what I've been quoted in the past (hundreds).   He also offered to clean a large area rug for $20! This is a ridiculous price! I have paid over $100 elsewhere, and was stuck having to roll it up, drag it there, pick it up. Huge convenience. And it came out awesome.  Both Rob and his employee (sorry, I forgot his name!) were SO friendly and just all around ethical, nice guys. I would recommend them to anyone, anytime. I have never had a better carpet cleaner in the 13 years I've lived in the valley!

I started going to Fresh Vitamins 10 years ago and have been through various health kicks since then. Thankfully, this place manages to deliver every time! The selection of foods, vitamins, supplements is really substantial. Recently I went gluten free (not celiac, just feel way better eating GF), and the snacks, frozen foods, and wide array of even gluten free baked goodies has been really helpful to supplement larger shopping trips.  I love not having to make a full fledged stop into Whole Foods or another grocery for a few GF items or supplements - it's so quick to stop in here & get the items that you need during the week.  Last but not least is the smoothie bar! I've been getting smoothies here forever, and my kids love them too. The coyote is my fave, but have also tried the protein smoothies - and those are pretty good. I love the idea that this locally owned business has survived at 32nd St. & TBird while many of the shops around the area were forced to close during the recession. Just goes to demonstrate the staying power of a well run small business that caters to a niche group of consumers!

Oh man, where do I start? I am kind of on a mission to try all the restaurants in the Cave Creek / Carefree area to try and expand our "circle of restaurants". The Lariat was - by far - the worst restaurant I've been to in a long, long time. The full extent of the inane disorganization of this establishment wasn't discovered until the following morning after our visit.   Upon arrival, was promptly seated by the hostess and had water and bread delivered fairly rapidly to the table by a non-talking deliverer, but so far so good.... Then, a full 20 minutes went by before we were even acknowledged by our waiter, who came to get our drink orders. Well, we didn't even have a wine list... so another wait to grab the wine list and decide on the fly (we could've had 20 minutes to decide had we been given the wine list with the menus). We ordered 1 soda and two glasses of wine by the glass.   The waiter returns a little while later to get our meal order. I ask if the scallops, trout, or halibut is better and he replies he doesn't eat seafood. Ok, then, I'll have the trout I guess. Prime rib special for hubby and mussels and hot dog (kids meal) for the kid.   Another 25 minutes passes, we are OUT of water and OUT of bread and STILL no wine or waiter in sight. I flag down an official-looking person and asked if she was the manager, and she confirmed that she was. I explained that we had been sitting for 45 minutes and still had no drinks and were even out of water at this point. She apologized and said she would "do something about our bill."   She returned with our wine (still no waiter?) and another 15 minutes passes.... waiter does not return and nowhere in sight... so I flag the manager down again because I'm ready for glass #2 of wine or I'll have nothing with dinner. Dinner comes literally 30 seconds after the manager fetched my glass of wine. Had I not flagged her down, I would've been out of drinks - again - for my meal.   Now, for the meal review.... mussels were "ok" according to child. My trout was breaded in an almond crust that was mushy and unappealing looking. It wasn't inedible, but I felt like I was having the fish special at Sizzler. Hubby's butter lettuce salad was drowning in a thick, store-bought tasting dressing. The kids meal with hot dog was utterly disgusting. NO exaggeration, the bun was as hard as a rock... as if it had been sitting out for weeks uncovered. I have no clue how anyone put a hot dog in that rock bun and didn't think to themselves, "Hmmmm, this bun just might be hard enough to chip someone's tooth!" I wouldn't have fed that bun to ducks at the park.   Mercifully, our meal is over. Yet, we have another painful wait for our check, which they were so kind as to comp us "one glass" of wine. Maybe it was my glass since I complained? What about hubby who also waited 45 minutes for his?   Now, for the icing on the cake of the worst-restaurant-experience-in-history: Hubby wakes up in the morning and goes to store and realizes The Lariat never returned his credit card with the check the prior evening. Maybe they thought they would keep it so they could try and re-charge us for that glass of wine ;) So, we had to spend time cancelling the credit card on top of the travesty of the evening.   It's obvious that this restaurant caters to hotel guests and doesn't care about locals at all. Most of the guests in the restaurant were north of 70 years old. This is only relevant because I suspect it's not the demographic that is running around posting online reviews. Otherwise, I suspect this restaurant would be in big, big trouble and I would've steered WAY clear of this place had there been more honest reviews.

For living in Cave Creek, I realized I had only visited Bartlett Lake once before - and that was on a boat! Definitely not the same as checking a place out on foot. Today, my kids (ages 6 and 9) hiked out one of the trails - Jojoba Trail #511. Jojoba trail is part of the Tonto National Forest. You need to get a Tonto National Forest pass to park anywhere beyond the area where you enter off of Cave Creek Rd. We went on a Sunday, so the ranger station was closed. The marina store was open though, and we were able to pick one up there. They also sell snacks, soda, beer, etc. You can also pick up passes in Cave Creek/Carefree at Circle K and other places. Apparently the fine is about $100 if you don't have it visible. There were pot toilets at the parking area - although not well maintained and pretty gross and smelly.  For Jojoba Trail - Go until Bartlett Lake Rd. ends at the marina/parking lot. On the left side of the parking lot after you enter you'll see a sign for a hiking trail - that is Jojoba Trail. I would not recommend this trail for anyone who is unstable, and definitely not younger than 5 or so. My kids are pretty good hikers, but it was even a bit of a challenge for my 6 year old due to slippery rocky areas. It is also not terribly well marked, so if you go off the trail you might have trouble finding it again (as happened to us for about 10 minutes). Luckily, it was coolish 70 degrees and cloudy on this fine day, so it was a non-issue. Wear PANTS. Lots of brush, even in parts of the trail, and easy to slip and get scraped up.   We hiked to a cove, although I don't think it was Rattlesnake Cove, but who knows? Nothing is marked, and there are no maps for this trail that I could find either online or in the area there. Kids got to wade in and dog swam around to cool off. I think you could easily swim here in the summertime, and it's a pretty easy 1 mile hike to get to the cove we stopped at (and turned back at that point). It would be HOT in the summer though - so I would definitely do it very early in the morning in the hotter months. They had a great time exploring the little peninsula. We didn't have fishing poles, but it would have made a fantastic fishing spot!  The hike itself was awesome. So beautiful hiking right next to the lake, and with all of the beautiful cacti. I hear there's lots of wildlife here. We didn't see any, but it's pretty remote way deep in the canyons so I would expect that it would be easy to spot some desert creatures. So beautiful! I will definitely do this hike again. There was nobody else on the trail with us, so I suspect that it's not very well known. Which makes sense, since there's no maps or anything online.

As far as locally owned coffee joints go - this place is as good as it gets. The coffee is fantastic, they even have soy & almond milk (thank you!) My personal choice is a soy vanilla latte, and Saddlecreek makes the best one I've ever had.  You can get your breakfast panini (eggs, cheese, spinach, chorizo/bacon or ham) gluten free, and they have several other gluten free options too! YAHOOO! Nice selection of pastries, and a great environment to chat and hang out. There are booths, tables, and outdoor seating with your pooch's next water bowl. It's a nice relaxing place to chill out with family, friends, or all by your lonesome enjoying your extraordinary joe.  Oh, and the owner has chickens and sells his farm fresh eggs right out of the front refrigerated case. I heart that.

For an airport restaurant where people actually have somewhere to go, the service is painfully slow! No water refills even though I drained mine in the first 30 seconds, no asking if we need anything else, It was a slow and painful experience.   We had omelette, crepes, and zinc croissant. I am a fairly light eater but found myself still hungry after my zinc croissant (even after including the offensive FOUR DOLLAR upcharge for a single tomato slice). My husband was still hungry after his omelette and so both of us foraged on the ample remainder of our kids' crepes. The crepes were not good, but we were still hungry. Way too strong cinnamon flavor and just a funky taste with the creme fraiche. Will I be back next time I'm wasting time in terminal four at Sky Harbor? Sorry, no, this restaurant is a huge fat fail.

It would be nearly impossible to beat this toy store - anywhere, anytime, and in any city. Unbeknownst to me until today, I just learned that it is the Oldest Family Owned Miniature, Doll, and Toy Store in North America! I believe it - the selection of toys, dolls, and miniatures (doll house stuff) is INSANE. It's better than FAO Schwartz in New York City for usability and selection. If you need a birthday present for a baby, toddler, elementary, or even junior high age kid.... this is the place to go. The owner(s) are engaging, helpful, and actually customize your gift giving experience and offer recommendations on the newest and hottest toys. They offer complimentary gift wrapping too, thank you very much!   This place is like going to your neighborhood wine store that offers a small selection of handpicked wines. Many Melissa & Doug picks, literally hundreds of "crafting" type of kits, from crocheting, knitting, to pillow making and scrapbook making. Many of them are marked "Best Toys 2012, etc." and other labels so you kind of know if they are tried and tested.  I have purchased every single birthday present that we've needed here over the past 8 years or so, and many holiday gifts as well. You could literally do all of your holiday shopping here in one trip. The games are very unique, many of them classics... think Operation, Scrabble iterations, Chess, dolls, dominoes, etc. You can absolutely find something here everytime for any party that nobody else will buy or bring when everyone else just went to Target on their way to the party.  My kids are beyond toddlerville now, but this place now has an entire side reserved for younger children to play in, and there are tons of scheduled playtime type of events, like the recent "Meet Elsa" events that were very popular.  Love that this place is family owned and is run exactly the way a small biz should be run - with attention to detail, service, and that warm fuzzy feeling that makes you feel awesome spending a few bucks there.

Sadly, another disappointing addition to the Cave Creek dining scene. Man, we really (as in desperately, really really desperately) need something decent up here - but this ain't it. If any restaurant developers or entrepreneurs are reading this - a decent, independent restaurant with a good bar and wine list would be mobbed! I think Tatum Ranch alone has 10k residents with basically nowhere to eat.  We've been here 3 times, all mediocre at best. Our last visit kind of sealed the deal on us never returning.  Outside patio area is nice, especially the booths! Great during nice evenings. Nonstop chips. They have really trained their servers and wait staff very well how to serve and cater to the customers. My only (weird) complaint really is that there isn't much "personality" amongst the employees/servers - it's obviously a very well-honed serving system that they have trained their people on, but it lacks authenticity a bit. It's not really a complaint, but it just feels a bit off I guess.  The food is pretty gross. My husband ordered the pollo fundido and the chicken MUST HAVE been frozen chicken. I could be wrong, but it tasted and looked just like that weird frozen, fake defrosted chicken color and tasted just like weird frozen defrosted chicken with the fake grill lines. It was literally inedible and gag-worthy. For a Mexican restaurant where pollo is front and center in most dishes, this is inexcusable.   I am SO SO SO sad that we don't have another new restaurant to frequent. I will stick with Amaro next door that is so underrated that it's shocking. I love that place.

Not a huge surprise that this restaurant has (mercifully, as another reviewer pointed out) closed. It was a train wreck from Day 1. But blaming Tatum Ranch for its failure? Yikes. As a business owner who struggled and survived (barely) the Great Recession, there is only one place to look when a business goes under - at its leadership. It's not your landlord when you can't pay the rent, it's not the crappy customers who don't know good service when they see it, and it's not economy (usually).   A successful business needs strong leadership, a unwavering commitment to customer service, and a competitive product. Asado seems to have had none of these.   I will repeat again (maybe someone is listening who is hoping to open a restaurant up in these parts?) what we need in Tatum Ranch and why:  There is MAD CRAZY NEW construction up here! Big new custom homes, huge new developments means customers with cash. Aside from Brisam's (pretty good and always packed, but I can't go there every day!) and Babbo, we have a 10+ minute drive to any other decent restaurants.   WE NEED a chef-driven, independent type of restaurant that is contemporary American-style, transitional food. Not Italian, not Chinese, not pizza, and PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, no Mexican. Good cocktails, great wine list, family-friendly, nice appetizers, a great bar, good prices, HAPPY HOUR MENU, and continue the outdoor patio! Think Rusconi's, Fox Restaurant concept stuff (Culinary Dropout, etc.) as far as food goes.   This place used to be a hopping happenin' place when it was the old Cocomo Joes! Granted, the food sucked and the service left something to be desired... but people FLOCKED to that place on the weekends w/ the bands that played. They had a competitive product - the best cougar bar in Maricopa County ;)   It's a great location and a restaurant is even more desperately needed now that Amaro has also closed next door.

Since Indigo opened, I've been here 4 times - but the first three visits were within the first few months of opening. Thus, we had a great experience twice, and the 3rd time not-so-great which caused us to delay a return visit. As a local, I want... I NEED to give local restaurants the benefit of the doubt and delay judgment. I'm so glad I did!! Today's visit was was fantastic and I'm a bit disappointed that I waited this long to return. I like to have several visits under my belt until I review new local Creek spots. The ambiance is pretty awesome - it's big, modern rustic in aesthetic, and very Creeky.   Cocktail list is great! A large list of handcrafted cocktails with fresh ingredients. Hubby drinks Moscow Mules, and so our kids have taken to ginger ale + lime as a drink. Indigo served up a great N/A ginger beer plus lime for the kids, no Seagrams! Wine list is extensive and wonderful. Rombauer chardonnay by the glass = YES, please! We also enjoyed a Stags Leap red blend by the glass. Wine people need not be worried about the wine options at Indigo.   We started with a prosciutto with pulled mozzarella (basically a caprese) which was a great starter. My kids are foodies, and typical kids menus don't cut it for them. My older now always orders off adult menus because of the lack of options. Off the kids menu: One shrimp fettuccine pasta with cream sauce. Shrimp was large, flavorful... an awesome kids dish. Perfect! For the rest of us, we had the Ling (cod, kind of like halibut) on a bed of broccolette, lobster ravioli (so rich!) with a lobster tail, and the airline chicken. The ling was cooked perfectly, wonderously as was everything we ordered.   We had the flourless chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce for dessert and it was awesome as well! So good with the last of the Stags Leap red blend we had. Julio was our waiter, and he was on point and delivered exceptionally good service and great suggestions on ordering, questions, etc. He was awesome and was always there when we needed him. I freak out (not literally, I just get a little sad) when I get my dinner arrives and - GASP - my first glass of wine is gone. Julio timed my wine perfectly, and made sure my Rombauer was there before the perfectly prepared Ling was delivered.   We will definitely be back and look forward to a menu that changes occasionally (it was changed since our initial visits -- so please continue doing that!) so we can return as regulars and enjoy different meals and experiences.

I am a heat-seeking missile with new restaurants in my neck of the woods, so had to visit The Bourbon Cellar since it just opened mere weeks ago.   SO MANY PROS with this place! It has a great ambiance, nice bar, contemporary/rustic vibe, and good music playing. All is positive on the ambiance.  Chef came out more than once to ask us how everything was (HUGE PLUS!) Our waitress was nice and helpful. The service was great and welcoming in every respect.  9 year old daughter ordered oysters, apparently flown in fresh daily from Prince Edward Island. We are huge seafood lovers, and have spent quite a bit of time in Maine and the east coast, so we've had the best. The oysters did not disappoint, they were fresh and fabulous with plenty of traditional oyster fixins'. "Tasted like the ocean!" according to the child. I agree, but she only let me have one! She also ordered a creamed corn side, which she licked clean. I thought aloud, "Where else could we go in Phoenix to have oysters like this?" We came up empty, so if you want an oysters fix, this would be THE PLACE to go!  My other one had a nice shrimp and potato soup that she enjoyed. I had the scallops appetizer (2 scallops) plus a salad, and husband had a steak plus roasted potatoes on the side. All was great, and perfectly prepared.  Unfortunately, the prices are utterly insane and really puts me at more of a 3 star rating. This isn't Binkley's or even Ruth Chris. The ala carte pricing is crazy. Once you pay $44 for the entree and add a side, you're at $60/person before alcohol, salad, or a dessert. Add in two glasses of wine/cocktail per person and you're at $85. We are not strangers to ridiculous-over-the-top dinners, via places like Binkley's Cave Creek and Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, so this is not a pricing complaint.  Only 1 out of the 4 of us ordered a proper entree. I had two scallops and a salad! One kid had a bowl of soup, that's it. And the other one had 12 oysters and creamed corn side. Bill with tip was nearly $250. A proper meal for each guest would total $100 for the entree + side + salad or appetizer, and two drinks.   I appreciate that the oysters are flown in daily, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the food. The food we had was fantastic. Maybe mix it up and have a few "lower priced" entrees with the higher end stuff? To justify this kind of pricing, you have to have a serious competitive advantage. Give the people some bread, or do something to give them a warm and fuzzy feeling -- like they are truly getting a special experience found nowhere else. I don't know what the answer is for this place, but austere ala carte pricing always makes me feel stressed out, and there is no way I could justify a $400 + tip bill for four people on any kind of regular basis. Maybe this is supposed to just be a special occasion kind of restaurant, and not geared toward locals or families. However, I just don't think it's quite special enough - yet - to garner just special occasion guests.   Please, please, please rethink your pricing and menu strategy. We DESPERATELY need a chef-driven restaurant up here, and the food is great!! I would be back in a heartbeat if the menu and pricing was revamped a bit. At this price point, though, I just can't see myself visiting again. I hope to revise my review soon.
