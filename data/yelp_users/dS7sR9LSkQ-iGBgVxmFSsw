I recently had a business to business experience with Scaredy Cat Hospital and absolutely loved it.  I installed window film on their front office windows and one interior window.  The lady at the front desk was very polite and fun to talk to.  Once I give in to letting my girlfriend get a cat (my whole family is allergic), I will be taking it there.  Judging by their professionalism and fun environment, I'm guessing their service is just as good if not better.

We brought my girlfriends car to Whitey's this afternoon due to her back tire hanging off.  They agreed to evaluate the problem and give us a quote.  A few hours after drop-off they called and let us know her car was ready.  We arrived back to a bill of $21.  Apparently a bolt just fell off her rear drivers side tire.  They fixed it and we were on our way.  We were both extremely impressed with the service, manners, honesty, and quality the guys provided us. All of which seem rare in their industry.   We will never take our cars to another establishment as long as we live in Arizona.  This is far and away better than all of the other car places we have been to since living in Arizona for 7 years.  I highly recommend them.  There is a good reason they have a 5 star rating.

I've been going to see Sebastian (Ryan) about once a month and he has been giving me a better haircut each time I'm in.  I would highly recommend going to Rolfs and requesting him.  As far as the atmosphere goes, second to none.  The tile work throughout the salon is impressive.  They are polite, organized, clean,and good at what they do.  As long as Sebastian is working there, I will be getting my haircut there.

I would have stayed to experience McFadden's but it literally smelled like a sewer. I haven't been this disgusted walking into something since the porta pottys at the State Fair. Had a drink then left.

I have never seen such an unkept course.  I would not be writing this review if I had payed $10 to play here but they charged us $50!  The cart paths were rough, the grass was yellow, and the greens looked like a disease was growing on them.

If you've experienced A Detroit coney, you would understand. Arizona has needed a real coney for a long long time. The dogs are shipped from Michigan and they serve a mean hani.   The owner is great and makes sure everyone has a good experience there. I would highly recommend this place anyone and everyone, especially if you're from Michigan.

I hired David to redesign my company website and he did more than a fantastic job for an unbelievably fair price.  He brought my 2010 web site up to date and really improved our web traffic.    He was prompt, responsive, and great to work with.  I would highly recommend Sun Devil IT to anyone interested in web design and IT.  He went above and beyond my expectations.

This place is so good! They have a great combination of unique and original ice cream flavors. Everywhere from Cap N Crunch, Nutella and Froot Loops flavors to red velvet, raspberry sorbet and vanilla! I their famous cookie cup with banana and coconut ice cream with a coconut macaron. They also roasted a marshmallow on top of it right before they handed it to me! This place is as good as advertised!
