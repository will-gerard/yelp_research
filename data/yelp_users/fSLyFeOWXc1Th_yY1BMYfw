I had heard so many rave reviews about this place, and they were all completely justified! This was easily the best sandwich I've ever had. Highly recommend!

This place is cheesy, cheesy "Daryl's O.K. used cars" type of feel. They have about 67 sketchy characters trying to wash your car at once, and the end result is a car with water spots? I was very upset with how poorly they handled the simple task of washing my car. The worst part of the whole thing: THEY STOLE 6 QUARTERS I HAD IN MY CUP-HOLDER!! If you are a recently paroled felon, or person who has no hope for a decent shot at a career- get a job at Danny's on E Highland Ave. I tried this because my regular car wash is closed on Sundays.. I would recommend everyone go to Hot Shots on 16th street. The management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees.

People. People. Some of you negative nancys need to take a deep breath and stop complaining about getting charged 25 cents for using your credit card. Yelp reviews can make or break these local businesses, and small things like processing fees aren't a true representation of what a coffee shop experience should be about. Hava Java is a great independent coffee shop with great tasting coffee and tea. The baristas are on-point and very friendly. For the price you pay, you get a great beverage, and it doesn't taste anything like strbx. The 1 negative of this place is the lack of seating- it is a 'run and gun' coffee bar- and if I want to stay and read or do work, I go to Lux. Maybe make the outdoor seating more compact and expansive? I want more independent local businesses like Hava Java in my neighborhood, and I'm willing to pay a little extra for that- but they do give punch cards here so it all evens out and then some!

This is one of the best places in the US. Seriously- they have the best everything- try the iced coffee just to start! Their breakfast is amazing too. The lines that form for this place look like the iPhone 4 release at an Apple store- but the employees always keep their cool.

I had a great experience here. I brought some shirts and coat here that were in very bad shape. "My dog" threw up on my shirt actually, and she got that nasty, disgusting stain completely out! I have been here several times and the proprietor has always been very pleasant and genuine to work with. I'm sorry some people had bad experiences here, but it doesn't seem like we are talking about the same business?

Truly great customer service- from an auto parts store! I came in looking for a new battery, and I was in and out in less than twenty minutes. Michael even put the battery in my car for me!! He was very nice, and genuine- I will go back just to support honest people like him. They were very organized at this location in general. I will be back.

I am not writing this review to be mean, but I truly disliked this place. The place needs a facelift, it's struggling in comparison to any of the other places in close proximity- and yes I understand it's much cheaper. I tried it on a Tuesday when they even had a special, so it was cheaper than usual even. The decor is a little bit of a timewarp, and it wasn't very clean- there was 1 person in the place; usually a major red flag but hey 2 tacos for like 5.99 what the heck? Then I realized it was 7pm, so I almost walked off. I was drawn to a sign that was implying there food was somewhat healthy. Wrong. Now for the bad part- the food. Really sad and bland, reheated food. Those tacos were bad, and I'm not very picky. The beans might have been the most pathetic thing I've ever tasted, and were a little burnt from sitting in that pan all day. How do you mess up beans if you're a Mexican restaurant? I guess the 1 star should go to the nice employee who nobly served me the jail food. He had a very defeated look, as if to plead with me to RUN. He was nice though- he would be wise to apply at one of the many stellar places right in tacos del mar backyard. If I was the owner of this establishment I would probably renovate and reinvent the joint quite a bit, the rent can't be cheap in this area and there is quite the competition.

Everything about TFK is awesome; from the vibe, to the drinks, to the food. This is one of the most unique concepts you will ever find. The food is very healthy, but so incredibly tasty. I recommend the Turkey Burger.

This is a great place to eat! The food here has never disappointed. I had stopped here for lunch a few times, but today I went for breakfast, and I was totally impressed with my food. I had the French Toast- it was great! You can't go wrong with any of the food or coffee here. This place is somewhat like La Grande Orange- but without the huge, swarming crowds.

I enjoyed my experience here. The sushi was fresh when I went, it seems as though other yelpers haven't had my luck. The rolls are original, I like that they have less of the shrimp tempura in their rolls. Their concept is more of a 'club sushi' atmosphere- great for a date, or late-night. My favorite thing about Moira was the sake-fusion drinks. So awesome! The one negative is the cramped tables- I recommend the sushi bar.

YES! This place is fantastic! Really good food, probably my favorite mexican in the city. The guacamole is righteous! I would recommend that and also the Carne Asada burrito. Cowabunga!

This is a car wash that I would highly recommend. They do a great job, and pay attention to the details. It costs a little more at Hot Shots, but it's worth it. It takes a bit more time, too- but worth it. The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time.

I am torn in this review. The burgers are very good here, but I had an experience this weekend that was a nightmare. This is one of those cases where the food is exceptional but the service was terrible. There are 2 male bartenders that served us, one was friendly and helpful. The other guy was so rude that I'll never go back. He rolled his eyes at us TWICE! Once because we asked him what burger the guy sitting next to us got. The second time he rolled his eyes was when we asked to split the check. We heard him say to another employee something to the effect "Split the check on $30, stay at home." Sorry to ruin your life bud, but not thrilled on the $17 price tag for the Kobe burger, and that coupled with your attitude just made me never want to return.

I think this is a very good yogurt shop, and maybe I'm just easy to please in this department?I came in late one night as they were closing, and sheepishly asked if I could sneak in for a fix- the lady was very nice and said "Of course!"

These are the best dogs I've ever had, no contest. This place is worth going out-of-your-way for. My favorites are The Lady and The Bear. I recommend getting The Bear with the spicy hot dog, you likely won't find anything so addicting!

I would have never known this place existed- but I found out about the greatness that is Fuego Tacos through a HomeRun offer. The chips and salsa were stellar, and I tried the pernil taco and the carne asada. I preferred the carne asada. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other tantalizing tacos! I also had a great drink with Jack Daniels! I will definitely be coming back.  NOTE: You must remember to have Fuego validate your parking, or you will be charged.

This is one of my favs in the Valley. All the food is stellar- you can't go wrong on their menu. Period. The drinks they serve are unique as well. This is a very popular place, so be prepared for this. I've had their spring rolls, amazing! I want to go back and try the shaking beef.  Negative: Parking is a nightmare.

Awesome experience here at Brunch today. This place was recommended by a friend, and lived up to all expectations. We had the eggs benedict with crab cakes and hollandaise; and the el matador- wow! The food was exceptionally good. I really liked the decor inside too- especially the cassette tapes on the wall leading to the lavatories. No negatives here!

I can't say enough good things about Premier. I bought a Living Social deal for a month of unlimited bootcamp, and I am so happy I did! The way they organized everything was well thought out, and the classes are just the right size. I was concerned the classes would be too big, and we wouldn't get the right individual attention. This was not the case at all. They push you just hard enough to where they leave you sore for days, but you want to come back to the classes! They pay careful attention to technique, and give tips to each individual person based on their level/needs. My favorite thing about the bootcamp classes are the trainers. They are so genuine, and passionate about what they do. Of course that makes all the difference, but they are just 100% real, and that's what I'm looking for. I've been to a few cheesy gyms, with some cheesy trainers, and you won't find that at Premier. If you want some training from some real people who know what they are doing, give this place try.

A great new venue! We really needed a new music venue here, and Crescent Ballroom really delivers. Great sound quality- I saw Washed Out last night and it couldn't have sounded better.

I tried this when they had the food truck event in The Whole Foods parking lot last Thursday- so good!! I believe they have these events on the 3rd Thursday of every month- I will be going back for sure. I had the 3 tacos combo- it was excellent. I first had an asian-mexican fusion taco at a famous food truck in Austin, Texas- and Shinobu was just as good! Go try this place out, you won't be disappointed!

I love Core Balance Studio so much. I really love the trainers. They are highly motivational, and genuine as well. I have only attended the Real Ryder classes, but I'm going to try some of the others. This is truly what I would call a boutique gym. If you are interested in trying this place out at all, I would highly encourage you to give it a shot. You will feel welcome the first time you go, and they will challenge you physically every minute you are there. Thanks Grant!

I came here for breakfast last Sunday, and I will be back. The cold drip coffee was delicious and the vibe was cool here without a doubt. I ordered the bananas foster french toast- it might have been the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. I heard they close early so get there by noon.

Well, I tried to get my LGO fix before I left Phoenix. I made the mistake of thinking the airport version was the same as the flagship location in Arcadia. I have been to the flagship store over 100 times, and the food quality is always consistent & excellent. Their pizza is amazing yes, but so is their green chile burger. It's a generous beef patty made with never-frozen grass-fed beef. Now for the airport version of the green-chile burger that doesn't belong in the same universe: the beef patty was not the same weight, it was a thin, dry McDonald's quality patty. It lacked flavor and was just old & tired. Also I asked for it to be cooked medium & it was well-done. I don't think the English muffin was from LGO. There was no Russian dressing. The green chiles were soggy & disgusting to the point I took them off. I didn't have time to bring it back since I had to board a plane. If you are looking for a top-notch restaurant in Phoenix give LGO in Arcadia a try. Skip the airport location which is bringing down their brand that they have been trying to establish for many years.

This is a really cool, one-of-a-kind boutique. They have some of the hippest frames that I've ever seen, both sunglasses and regular eyeglass frames that you can get your prescription lenses put in. The Owner, Christy, is very nice and genuine, with a true passion for style. You would be hard-pressed to find a place like it - definitely worth going out-of-your way for!

I love the vibe at Waverly! Very cool salon with a rad decor. Sarah was my stylist today and she did an amazing job with my hair. She was very friendly and personable- I would highly recommend her! If you're looking for someone to help with your look, give Waverly a try, Govna!
