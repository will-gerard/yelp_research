Family and I stayed overnight and utilized it all: the little gym, the pool, jacuzzi, and devoured the breakfast--oh and my kids raided the bowl of chupa-chup lollipops on an hourly basis.  Pretty standard- definitely on the "nicer" side- Marriot rooms, but I have to say, the excellent staff really put it over the top for us. From the housekeeping staff, to the front desk, everyone was so sweet and service-oriented, all smiles, and ready to assist when needed.  The lobby is quite impressive with its glass-bubble chandelier.   The pool area was just large enough, plenty of space, great sized pool and nice hot jacuzzi. Lush grounds.  Right across the road from some good restaurants, the FLW Spire, the freeways, yet tucked away from traffic. Very convenient.  I'd stay again in a heartbeat. Perfect for families. I booked through the Marriot website, used up some points.

Nice place- we went for happy hour and sat at the bar. Not crowded when we were there (a Thurs evening)  Bartenders suggested the tacos and they were very very good (we had barbacoa). Also had the grilled chicken nachos and the tableside guacamole. All tasted really fresh and good.  Loved the HUGE 5.00 house marg-- noticed the other specialty drinks were very expensive, like 11.00-12.00!! I THINK the house marg was the only happy hour special (at 5.00 like I said) but you'll have to check me on that.  Choices can be very limited in Scottsdale proper- it is either super casual (think: Rubio's!) or super exclusive/expensive (read:snobby)  We usually end up on the patio at Carlos O'Brien's (also off Bell Rd) but this was a nice change pf place. Classier.

The cupcakes are HUGE and really beautifully made.  The best part is, its IN THE MALL, so you can pick up one or a dozen the same time you pick up the birthday gift!  TONS of frosting, ala Sprinkles, don't say I didn't warn you. You'll be heading for diabetes if you eat these regularly.

While visiting family in AZ, we took the kids here. There was special online and it was only 11.00 for 2 hours, I believe. Can't beat that, and it was a welcome break from the pool (imagine that!) and being stuck inside the house during the day. (So hot here now)  It had all the kid-pleasers including dodge-ball, foam pit, and free-play in a safe environment.   Just hose your kids down with antibacterial (or bleach) when you get them home. (Just kidding...)

Wow this place was pretty awesome...cute lil neighborhood joint with very good pizza.  I am used to great eats in L.A., where I live, but this I wish this place was near me.  First off, they have FREE kids meals with each adult entree purchase on certain nights. I think we were there on a Sunday evening. We got like 4 FREE kids meals, which helps when you have a caravan of kiddoes...  The pizzas and salads were surprisingly good... we tried a caesar salad, and 3 different pizzas, I can not remember what they were, sorry, but the crust was perfect and the toppings fresh and good. With a cold brew (cute little friendly bar set up too) you really can't go wrong.

OK, so we stumbled upon this place on a sleepy Sunday morning. I was so happy to see it, we were starving. Note: There are NO breakfast places along Shea Blvd....  I didn't even notice the "all local organic" thingy till we got inside. Nice I like that.  I did notice a disgusting sewer smell. No, it was not eggs. Just as I was thinking "maybe its me" a toddler voice shouted "Mommy it stanks in here" Toddlers don't lie. It did stink.  As I prayed whatever it was that stunk would go away, I pondered the menu. Not extensive but alright: eggs, omelets, french toast, pancakes.  The stink did come and go, thank gawd it wasn't constant, I wouldn't have been able to handle that.  I got the freshly squeezed OJ and it was great. I also ordered the French Toast. It sounded interesting as they use sourdough. Weird, right? It was weird. Not a fan of the sourness going through it. But it was nicely griddled and the syrup and delicious scoop of whipped butter helped. The eggs and bacon( a bit skimpy tho) on the side were very good, as were the hashbrowns I ordered on the side.  Hubs had the Popeye omelet, and my bite was very tasty.  All in all, a good place to go, but they really need to fix that sewer problemo.

I was in the area visiting familia and staying up the road at the Marriot Springfield Suites. Took a walk (Note: stay on the East side of Scottsdale Road, if you walk, the other side is inexplicably closed to pedestrians. There is a sidewalk but then it abruptly ends stranding you in the middle of a gnarly intersection...trust me, AZ drivers are complete lunatics, and they despise pedestrians, so please exercise caution)   Scottsdale is actually my hometown of sorts. I spent my teenage to early 20's years in this town. Its fun to be a tourist now.  Was surprised to learn this spire is somewhat legit. That credibility is difficult to find in a city full of chain restaurants, Walgreens, rich white people and mega-resorts. Reading the bronze placard, I learned it was designed by a disciple/student of big Frank LW. Cool.  It is pretty impressive up close. The location is somewhat unfortunate, that corner of Scottsdale and Bell is Uber - busy and very loud. When you take a pic (see mine) you will either see a busy road in the background, or "Romano's Macaroni Grill" awnings. Typical Scottsdale views.  The fountain and resulting reflection pool was a nice little spot to contemplate, and watch birdies flit around. I recommend coming here early morning to beat the heat in summertime. Bring water.  Not much else to see, save a few other bronze sculptures. I would also check it out at night, when its lit, but again, beware of the traffic if you are on foot. Maybe stroll out there after dining at RMG.

What a friendly welcoming place!   When I am in town, I get my favorite, chocolate, lemon and cherry ice layered in a medium size cup. It reminds me of my beloved Italian Ices we used to get at the pizzerias in NY in the summertime, missing the squishy paper cups!  You can also get any flavor ice with a big swirl of the thick vanilla frozen custard inside it- my son loves that one.

Really enjoyed this cute little spot in Scottsdale. Very nice modern decor, misters on patio (we sat inside) looked like a great place for happy hour, and I see in the other reviews it is. Want to come back and try out their cocktails and appetizers sometime.  Yeah, good sushi in Scottsdale, Arizona!  The service was efficient, friendly and helpful- thanks to our server, Hunter. I let her know I only had an hour, tops, for lunch and she promised to make sure we were taken care of. We were.  To start, we had the Crab Rangoons so good. Not greasy at all, and piping hot. Loved the hot, sweet chili dip.  I had Flying Phoenix, upon Hunter's recommendation. It was very good. Black pepper- crusted tuna tataki, avo, shrimp, spicy crab with a black-pepper sauce. Good sized roll, unique with that black pepper going on, and very filling.  Companion was happy with her roll as well, I tried it and it was very delectable. Hory Fook was the name, and had shrimp tempura, avo, spicy tuna. Loved the slice of fresh jalapeno on top, and the aoili gave it a nice kick too, but not too spicy.  We were in and out of there in time, the bill was only $38.00 to get a Sushi fix in the desert. Next time, I'd like to spend a little more time dining there.
