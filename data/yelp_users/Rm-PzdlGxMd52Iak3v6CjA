On May 22, 2014 I agreed to rent a small car for 3 days. I was quoted a rate of $170.67 and the vehicle was priced at $36.00 per day. I returned the vehicle on May 25, 2014 only to be charged $415.75 and was being charged $44.00 per day. When I called to figure out why I was being charged an additional $245.75 I was told that the blonde lady who rented me the car up sold me on services I did not agree too. In fact, the whole time I was there I told her I could not afford more then $200.00 and she assured me that $170.67 is all I would be charge. Every question I asked she lied about costing me an additional $245.75. She lied about what would happen if I returned the car early and the amount of the rental. This was my first time renting with this company and it will be my last. They are completely negligent when it comes to customer service and will be deceitful when it comes to billing your account. Please be careful when renting from this company, they will drain your bank account.

I have been going to this restaurant since I was a child and continue to go back. This mom and pop restaurant uses fresh ingredients, home grown herbs and have a wonderful menu! They take pride in their business and it shows through the quality of food and customer service. Love this place!!!

Not only is the environment fun and edgy but you get the absolute best service! Paul does a fantastic job on my hair and keeps a record of color formulas and cuts for touch ups. (Impressive) It's easy to relax, watch sports, and enjoy a cold one while getting your hair done!

The Academy of Scuba, whether it be the PV or Metro location, have been an excellent experience. I started at the PV location over a year ago to obtain my open water certification and trained with AOS ever since. The staff are very friendly and knowledgable when it comes to educating customers or potential prospect clients. I appreciate how the Academy of Scuba will adjust your training around your schedule to ensure you have the best experience possible. The dive professionals at the Academy of Scuba are also fun to train with and take a personal interest in your development as a diver. Getting involved with the diving community through this business has formed many new friendships that will likely last a lifetime. The community is very close and we often dive with one another regularly. They have monthly dive socials and are at the lake every weekend to give anybody a chance to dive with them. They also organize underwater vacations, my favorite, which provide affordable vacations to exotic places!!! These trips can cater to any budget or lifestyle. Finally, I want to end on the training aspect, you can take any type of class with the Academy of Scuba. They train open water certifications to instructor certifications. As far as specialties go, you name it, they train it!!! This caters to any type of dive goal you may have or dream dive you have been wanting to pursue. I highly recommend this shop for ANYONE!!!

Smart Gym isn't even worthy of a single star. Long story short, this entire gym is a scam. Had to cancel my membership because of relocation and other personal matters that prevented  me from being able to utilize the gym. Talked to the gym manager, Jonnie and he said, "I will take care of it" and nothing was ever done. This has been an ongoing battle with Smart Gym since January of 2015. At one point even a collections department called me stating that I owe them almost $200 in fees and I called Jonnie immediately to complain about these erroneous charges. He then sent me a new contract signing me up for another year in exchange for the collections claim to disappear. I never agreed nor signed the contract, Jonnie typed in my initials on the contract and emailed it to me afterwards on May 19th, 2015. He kept trying to stall me canceling the membership and then asked me to email him directly to cancel the membership but I didn't trust him at this point and attempted to cancel the membership as instructed in my contract. I cancelled the membership by certified mail to the address listed in the contract. The billing department keeps charging my account and it has now cost me hundreds of dollars in fees from them constantly trying to pull funds from my account. I have now sent in 3 letters to cancel the membership as instructed by my contract but the cancellation department doesn't accept the certified mail and the cancellation requests are mailed back to me as undeliverable. The manager has not responded to this issue and no one I have spoken with seems to have an answer nor a solution. It seems this company just wants money and they don't even honor what is written in a legal contract. In fact, the address listed in the contract for the cancelations department is actually incorrect. The cancelations department will not accept mail. Like I said, this company is a scam. I have filed a complaint with the Attorney Generals office and am filing one with the BBB. If you are considering getting a membership with this company I highly recommend you don't. The gym is nothing special compared to other gyms and if any life changes occur to where you no longer can use the membership they will not let you out of the contract even if you cancel. The only way to get a resolution is to take legal action. DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM!!!!

I am not even sure where to begin with this ENTIRE experience. I scheduled an appointment a few months ago for an eye exam and the level of customer service and professionalism was awful. Day of my appointment it took them over an hour to even see me even though I arrived 30 minutes early. The women who was working the front counter that day stated it was her first day and told me that she DID NOT know how to charge my insurance. They charged me just under $100 that day for the exam and when I called my  VSP insurance they stated my copay should of been only $10 with my policy. VSP also informed me that they did run my insurance that day and received the full benefit. I am 100% positive that I was actually charged twice for my eye exam and that this was intentional. After being at this location for four hours I was finally finished and fitted with new lenses and sent on my way.   I was told to wear these new lenses for a week and if I liked them to come back in and they would order them for me. I was not able to come back for a few weeks  because I not only work full time but I am also a full time student and after my eye appointment I realized very quickly that they do not value their customers time. Once I was out of school I called to schedule a new appointment and to order lenses and that is when an annoying experience turned to a bad one. I called early in the morning on a Thursday to schedule an appointment to order lenses and the young women who I spoked with scheduled me the same day at 5:pm. I had to ask my job to leave early that day and coordinate to have extra coverage at work so I could make this last minute appointment.   I arrived at Visionworks right before 5:30pm that day and again waited for 10 minutes before even being acknowledged. I heard two guys laughing and carrying on in the back before one young man even appeared. (I was later told his name was Gordon). I told him I had an appointment and he told me that the doctor was already done for the day. I was obviously irritated because of the hassle I had to go through so I could even make this appointment and here this man is telling me I cannot be seen today. He told me to come back the next day. To make matters worse he was extremely rude to me and treated me as if I was inconveniencing him. I asked him for a copy of my prescription so I could go somewhere else since me wanting to order lenses is a problem. He refused to give me my prescription and said I do not have one saved in the system and then told me if I want a copy I have come back the next day. I was so mad I just walked out. I came back the next day again after work and asked to get the name of the rude guy from the previous day so I could report it and the two women working were very reluctant to give me any type of information. They had no concern about what had happened the day before nor did they care, they had the same, "I don't give a shit" attitude as Gordon.   The doctor finally had time to see me but wasn't very friendly and made me feel like being there was interfering with him leaving. He finally gave me my prescription and immediately left the building. The women then took me over and looked at my prescription and wrote a few notes on a piece of paper telling me that she cannot order my lenses until Monday because they cannot order lenses on weekends. I assumed she would not do it by her attitude and the fact me being there meant she had to do actual work so I left with my prescription.   A week later I called to see if my lenses were in yet and the guy I spoke to told me that there is no record of an order ever being placed. (At this point I am not surprised at all). This was actually good news to me because the last thing I want to do is give this company any more money after this. I thanked him and hung up. I called VSP to make sure they did not run my insurance for contacts since obviously I never received any lenses since they already charged me and my insurance for my eye exam.   I happily took my business somewhere else and was actually treated with respect and received my lenses within a week!!!  If you are considering using this business for an eye exam I highly suggest anywhere else but this place. I read the other reviews as well and see that I am not the only person to be treated this way. Save time and hassle and find a real optometrist and support a business not run by assholes.

I have been a patient of Dr. Beischel's for over 8 years and have always received the highest quality of treatment. He has the best staff who are friendly and make you feel right at home during your appointment! You will never have to worry about being sold on unnecessary dental work or procedures. You can always expect to have an open, honest and candid conversation with Dr. Beischel regarding your oral health. I highly recommend going to Beischel Family Dental for whatever your dental needs are! Did I mention his staff is amazing?
