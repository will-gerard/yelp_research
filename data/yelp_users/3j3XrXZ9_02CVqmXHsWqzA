I should have reviewed these guys years ago...so sorry for the delay. Again, you probably have to take into account that I'm a NYer living in AZ, so I generally seek out food that compares in taste and style to that which New Yorkers are accustomed to. We have phenomenal Chinese food in NY that grows from "hole in the wall" take out restaurants in cracks and crevices in the city. Red Dragon is such a place and I'm so happy that they're here. I only wish I didn't live a half hour away from them!  Despite the drive, they are worth the trip. They aren't fake Chinese food like Panda Express, so if that's what you know to compare them to, it may be a different experience for you.   The owners are from NY and they tout their place as "NY Style Chinese Food". They have and KNOW what duck sauce is! Hallelujah! I am always shocked that Chinese food places here don't use it nor know about it. Soy sauce is not the only Asian condiment people! Try duck sauce on your rice or dunk your egg rolls and spring rolls in it. DELISH! My husband loves the fried chicken wings (cooked in peanut oil). We adore the General Tso's chicken, their egg foo young is great and the rices are to die for! Great egg drop soup, chicken or beef and broccoli and too many other menu items to count! Anyone from NY will know just what I mean about the style and anyone from anywhere else- give it a try!  There's no fine dining, you won't want to eat in, as it's really not a sit down restaurant- no booths, cheesy tables and chairs, but I'm not use to eating at a Chinese food place unless it's a buffet anyway, and this is not. This is just amazing NY style Chinese take-out, definitely worth a try!

Is everyone else reviewing this place in cahoots with them or what?  I consider myself to be somewhat of a Chinese food connoisseur, so I am always excited to try a new spot. I was staying with a friend in this area, so I ordered from Abacus. First off, I found them to be a tad expensive. I ordered pork fried rice, chicken fried rice, crab puffs and chicken egg foo young with lo mein instead of white rice and it was $40.00!  The rice was bland and the pork was an odd color. The chicken fried rice was also bland.   The crab puffs were 99.9% warm cream cheese with the tiniest sprinkling of crab essence....   Our disgust was in the chicken egg foo young and lo mein. The lo mein came in an individual carton and was just dried noodles. There are no veggies mixed in nor any meat. The egg foo young looked like chicken and veggies in a thin brown sauce. I've ordered this same dish from every Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in and NEVER has it looked like this. We sent out a search party to locate the egg, the foo or the young but were unsuccessful, so we contacted the delivery company thinking they got the order wrong. After a half hour we received a call to inform us that that was INDEED the chicken egg foo young and that they don't mix the meat into the egg; they just pour it on top. Since I already had it and was unhappy by the presentation, I figured... why not try it and complete the cycle of unhappiness. The taste did not disappoint in that area. Three tiny egg patties sat underneath all of the water chestnuts, thin liquid, chicken, broccoli, and every other vegetable they could throw into this container....   THE BEST THING I ATE WAS THE FORTUNE COOKIE.... I'll never order from them again!

Being from NY, I have been dying to try this place, but must say I was DEEPLY disappointed! Claiming it is NY Style is a lot to live up to and false advertising. The menu has many items that they no longer carry with a piece of paper covering them. Nothing on the menu is reminiscent of the City. In NY we have hoagies filled with stuff, Italians with the works, the classic meatball, Boards Head deli meats on display. There are no paninis there.  The selection boasts "Chandler Style Subs and even a California style something, but NO NY menu items in sight.   My girlfriend and I both had the Tuscan Style Chicken Panini which was suppose to come on herb-roasted foccacia, but your choices were white or wheat. It was very watery and had no flavor. We had to keep adding salt and pepper. The side dish choice was either potato salad or a pickle. We both chose the potato salad, which came in a 2 FORKFUL bite size.There seemed to be no soup options on the menu, but when at the counter it said their soup of the day was chili. Where were the desserts? No NY cheesecake, no nothing. I didn't even see the ice cream someone else mentioned on here. The deli display case was completely empty, except for a few bottled waters, 2 gatorades and one loaf of deli meat, not a pleasing sight.  For $8.44 including tax, I believe that it was not a worthy experience. I am truly being honest and feel that's important because anyone that will go to this place expecting that it will be any way similar to the food you can get in NY, would be sorely mistaken.

My husband and I went to Bunna for the first time this past Saturday night. I was excited to hear they were having a Poetry Slam and we were starving, having not had dinner.  The spoken word was great, even for their first night and there not being too many in attendance. The owner was there that evening and you could see the pride he had for his small coffee house. The atmosphere is cozy and eclectic, with various tables and chairs. We didn't taste the coffee, so I'll update you about t when I go back.  My husband asked for a recommendation and tried the Mediterranean Chicken Wrap and a cherry italian soda said it was good. I had the Turkey & Swiss Panini with pesto mayo and a strawberry lemonade. It was delicious. They both came with Veggie Chips, which we had tried for the first time and were pleased. I LOVE when your accompaniment is something different from the norm. or $5.00 each meal plus our drinks, their lunch menu offerings are fantastic. I will happily go back and try the coffee another time, despite the drive.  In addition to all flavors of coffee, espresso, cappuccino and lattes, they also make shakes, smoothies, hummus, breakfast sandwiches and have bakery items. I see they also have a byob date night every Friday when they have a pasta dinner with acoustic music. I think we'll try this as well.   Impressed!

Being Puerto Rican and not having ANYWHERE good to go eat our food, I was excited about this place. I heard they had a great, inexpensive lunch. My husband and I went for dinner and could not be more disappointed.  First off, I have to say that Puerto Rican food and Cuban food is 98% identical, with the minor differences still crossing the cultures. I was sad to see that this restaurant did not have arroz con gandules- a staple side dish, but the owner said she was not taught to make it. The ropa vieja was bland and just basically looked and tasted like 3 pounds of shredded beef sitting like a mountain on my plate. The relleno de papa ( potato ball) was cold on the inside. The pastele was OK and my husband's bisteca was just alright.  The atmosphere of the restaurant really needs a makeover. I am always sad to see Hispanic restaurants that look mediocre because it makes me feel like we can't do a good job at our appearance, and that's just not true. Being a Hispanic designer, I know that for certain!  I realize that many non-Hispanics might find the food here fantastic, but for Latinos I feel it will miss the mark. I wish their business success, as the owner husband and wife are VERY nice people. I just hope the food and variety will improve.

I cannot say enough fantastic stuff about this place! My husband and I try to come eat once a week, if possible. I recommend them to everyone I come in contact with.  We use to go to another Indian restaurant just down the street, but stopped going there once India Oven opened. From day one we were greeted by the owner so warmly. The buffet has such a great variety or chicken, lamb and vegetarian dishes. Everything is always cooked just right and the flavor is never spicy. The mango lassi is now included with your buffet, all for under $8.00. It is worth drinking. She always refills the container when we arrive :-) They refill your naan repeatedly, always check on you to make sure you are enjoying your meal and the place is always clean. It's the best Indian restaurant I have been to in AZ, and I have tried 3 in Mesa, 2 in Chandler and 3 in Phoenix.   You've definitely got to try it!
