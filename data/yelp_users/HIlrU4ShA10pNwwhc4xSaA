Who woulda thought that what I thought was a small airport would be so nice.  Super clean, clear signage, comfortable waiting areas.  I didn't spend a lot of time here but I did walk through two concourses to catch my second leg to Burbank.  My first visit to this airport and I had assumed it was no larger than my local favorite Burbank.  I was wrong.  I don't think BUR even has a designated concourse?  In any case, it always nice to have a few rolling sidewalks to get you where you are going especially if you are running a bit late.  Along the way, I noticed a few kiosks selling local Arizona jewelry and there was a lot of local art instead of just drab and dreary walls painted a cool gray or sky blue.  This airport appeared to have a variety of local food restaurants and national vendors instead of the same stale, mass-produced sandwiches provided by a single food concessions vendor.    I was hoping to grab a local Phoenix Starbucks coffee bug to add to my city & state collection, but didn't see a store.  Because it was so hot here today, the airport was a tad warmer than even Fort Lauderdale but the free wi-fi and charging stations made up for it.  "Give me a Hamm on five, hold the Mayo!"

Big fan of Southwest.  We fly SW a lot and appreciate that they go out of our local airport.  This flight into PHX left from FLL 40 minutes late, but somehow the pilot was able to make up the time and arrive on time.  Regardless, the second leg out from PHX to LAX was delayed 50 minutes which meant I had about an hour to hang out at the SW gate in PHX for a bit.  A little confusing holding area as the check-in desk is situated on the opposite side of the room from the actual boarding gates.  Looks like the single desk handles 3-4 gates maybe.  The check-in staff wasn't clear that the plane arriving at our gate was NOT the plane we were supposed to board, so a lot of us started lining up but there was a whole 'nother group taking the arriving plane to Vegas.  They unloaded and loaded quickly and our plane arrived just a few minutes later.  Regardless, Southwest has very straightforward policies, and excellent prices.  We use our Southwest Visa all the time and build up beaucoup points and that's a nice bonus!  I also have a nephew-in-law who works for SW and we get a few buddy passes every year which is even a bigger bonus.  Now, even though the boarding process has changed over the years (remember those plastic blue ones?), the cattle call isn't much different than it was 15 years ago.  Being 6'5, I wish the leg space was a tad longer, but at the ticket price I can't complain much.  Flight attendants and staff are always friendly and happy which must mean they enjoy their job.  Years ago, they used to sing, tell jokes, and get pretty crazy on the flights, but I think they were told to tone it down a bit.  Once in awhile they crack a nice joke or announce the "Welcome to Chicago!" when your flight really landed in Colorado or something like that.  Love that humor.  Keep it up SW!

I've been here many times before and have never been disappointed! Smaller, more comfortable "off-strip" casino inside the hotel. Front desk is just 75 feet from the elevators, so you don't have to walk thru the entire casino to get to your room. Quick and friendly check-in. Staff is knowledgeable. Room was clean, big comfortable bed, lots of pillows, clean bathroom. Everything worked: TV, Remote, Fridge, Internet, Shower. Cons: The room was a little on the dark side - even with all the lights on.

Needed something to eat on a short layover.  Everything except Pizza Hut Express was closed and even this place was near closing.  Unfortunately, the buns didn't look so fresh, but I got one anyway.  I've had Cinnabon before and I love them, but by the time these things are exposed to airport fumes, they must go bad just like every other airport food court food.  I ate the stale thing while waiting to board my next flight.  I wished I had a couple shots of grand marnier to wash it down.  You really must get these things when they are fresh.  Lesson learned.
