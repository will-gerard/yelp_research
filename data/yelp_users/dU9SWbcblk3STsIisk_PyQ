I love this place. It's close to my apartment and the food is always good whether it's take out or dining in. The staff is always so nice too!

First time there and it wasn't too shabby. Thought it would be way worst but service was decent, wings were good and the fried zucchini was BOMB. I like the atmosphere, and the staff was nice. They have big booths which makes it comfortable to eat. Good happy hour prices too. I'll definitely be back.

Had a sudden craving for sushi and came upon this place last night. The food was good and the bartender was even better. I forgot what I ordered to drink but it was was absolutely delicious and refreshing. Two thumbs up for sure. The back bar in the patio was super chill, I'd be back forsure. :)

Went for the first time on a Wednesday evening and was quite surprised with the crowd. It was a huge comedy club very clean and simple. I've never been to a comedy club before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Our server was absolutely amazing, she was really good at checking back on us and our drinks came out quick. They were a little pricey but not too bad. I'll definitely come back!

This was actually my first time trying Mongolian BBQ in an actual restaurant. I've had it before at the food court in the mall and I usually love it because the flavors were always right. They have a good variety of meat, I wish they had more options for fish though! The veggies were also good, great variety. I'm a light eater so I had more veggies than meat and more fish. What got me was selecting my sauces! Too many to choose from and I had no clue what to add haha. Service was good, we had a young gentlemen check up on us which was nice because not every restaurant has a manager do that. (FYI that is a huge factor in the restaurant industry, a manager should always check on every table at least once!) But overall I had a pleasant experience here and I would definitely be back because the food was absolutely delicious, the portions, well that's really up to you on how much you shove in your bowl haha and it wasn't expensive at all! 25 dollars for two of us! You Can't beat that!

This place reminds me alot like Lucille's smokehouse BBQ and grill back home in California. Actually it did alot! I loved it though! The whole restaurant was absolutely adorable and they had a gorgeous patio area. We went in for lunch so we didn't really get to try anything they specialized in. We both had pulled pork, & oh my gosh it was so good! And their steamed veggies were perfectly cooked. Our server was cute and very friendly. We were her last table I could tell (I'm a server myself) anyways she was still very attentive and polite didn't make us feel rushed at all. I'll definitely be back for dinner!

I'm giving this place four stars for the food ONLY because I've always ordered take out. Pad se ew and summer rolls are my two favorite dishes. They won me with their summer rolls.   The food is amazing, they are fast and super friendly. Service is great. Portions are a lot bigger than the other two thai restaurants I found. And it isn't pricey either. If I lived closer I'd be there every night. Haha

I Went to this location for the first time yesterday and I wasn't disappointed. It's definitely loud and a little cramp but not uncomfortable at all. Anyone looking for a quiet restaurant to dine in probably wouldnt like it here but seeing how busy they are makes it okay. Plus it kinda sets the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. However  We sat in the cantina, it was a little small but we were able to grab a high top and had both perfect views of the t.v.   Their happy hour is awesome and the best part is its all day sunday in the cantina! They have good choices  and prices on cocktails and food. The taco baskets are to die for! They are amazing! And a good size! I could eat them all day! Except i only ate two because i was stuffed haha.   Our server was awesome he was super attentive. Being a server I think he did a great job being busy an all. He always got us refills on our drinks, checked up on us, made sure we were happy, and we were! I definitely think I'll be back, especially on sundays and I'll bring a few friends while I'm at it!

This place was amazing! Although they did not have some of the usual traditional japanese plates that most Japanese restaurants have such as a dragon roll or gyozas. But we did order a second round of the vegas roll because it was AMAZING! The spicy tuna wasn't the best but all the other rolls like the tempura roll, the soft shell roll &  yasu roll made up for it. Don't let me forget about our Waiter, I don't know his name but he was on top of it. Great recommendations, friendly, super attentive.  He got me my sriracha,  and everyone who knows me knows if you give me my sriracha your golden. I totally recommend this place and will return for sure.

I've always loved yardhouse, it's by far one of my favorite restaurants! This one doesn't beat the one back home in long beach but it's close enough! I love their happy hour menu and the huge selection of beers! Their chicken lettuce wraps are to die for! Always always Great food, positive atmosphere and amazing service from the host staff to the servers and even their bussers!  However, the only negative thing being a hospitality major and all is I didn't see any management walking around tables talking to guest. It's not a big deal to most people but it can really make a guest's experience go from an 8 to a 10.

Great food, huge restaurant and clean atmosphere. Server was basically there just to take our order so I'm hoping they tip out their bussers well. Never had to worry about being thirsty because the guy was always there to refill our glasses. The portions were huge, we were able to split the curry dish along with the lettuce wrap and the fried calamari. We even took it home for leftovers. Food came out fast and everything was absolutely delicious, I'd come back definitely.

Yum! I just tried this place for the first time today and all I can say is delish! I like the decor, it's a nice clean atmosphere. They have really big booths that makes it comfortable to eat. Food is amazing! We ordered the phad se ew (my favorite Thai dish) so far its the best I've found in Phoenix since my mom's recipe. The basil fried rice was also good, rich flavors and the perfect level of spice! I think I found my new thai spot! I totally will be returning!    Oh and Check out the fish tank full of fake fish,  its interesting. Haha

It's a hit or miss with this place. Sometimes you get great service and sometimes you don't. Every time we walk in the hostess usually just stares. The servers all suck at their job. I'm a server, I know what good service is. Our server was horrible! She literally walked up to our table chewing food, she stopped taking my friends order so she can yell across the patio to some friends driving pass us. Oh and don't let me forget to mention that she was playing with her hair brushing it with her fingers in front of us! Then serving us our food. This place is a joke, service is a joke. It's so bad that I know if I asked to speak to a manager the manager would have probably done nothing about it. However Unless I find a place with better wings I will be back but sitting on the bar. I always get better service from the bartenders.   So heres a note to management. Retrain your servers or get a new serving staff!

Alright, I love half moons food but gosh I can not believe the service! It's still horrible and I feel bad saying it because our server lastnight was sweet and all but I've never had such horrible service. Actually twice in a row. We came about a week and a half ago for the wings because hands down the best wings in phoenix but we kept getting ignored by our server she was more focused on her I'm guessing Co workers who were hanging out in the patio. We had to seriously wait almost 25 minutes for our check. Our plates were stacked up also which is a clear indicator that we were pretty much done with our meal.   Now we came again lastnight and I seriously was contemplating on even going there because I said to my roommate these exact words "I don't know if I want to go because we always get stuck with the worst server" and I totally jinxed it. We sat in the patio, I love the patio it's my favorite spot. Our table never got wiped down so we sat and ate on a sticky table. We ordered spinach dip first and it was sent to the wrong table. (I'm very observant, I'm a hospitality major and was warned if I were to continue with this career my whole restaurant dining experience would change because I pay attention to everything. I also work for a very fast pace busy restaurant who was rank top five for best service in all of phoenix) anyways, we ordered a burger to split, the California burger to be specific and it was delicious! However, it was very messy and we had one napkin to share, absolutely no silverware around and no plates. I've never had to share a napkin at a restaurant yet alone pass my plate back and fourth across the table. Then we got our wings, gotta get wings when you're at halfmoon.! They were of course delicious as always but she took our silverware when she pre-bussed our table and didn't bring us new ones  we were just so over it that we ate the wings chugged our drinks and asked for the check. Thankfully I have cash always because I also am a server. But I wasn't about to wait another 20 minutes for her to bring my card back.   Not all servers are bad we've gotten great service from a few girls, but I was taught that we're a team and everyone helps each other out, there were two other girls working the patio who never really acknowledged us. We made it very clear and obvious that we needed refills on drinks, napkins, our server or service! I felt very neglected as a guest.

The breadfruit is such a cute little restaurant in a very nice neighborhood in downtown. It's small but very well put together. Our waitress was absolutely incredible she knew how to sell so kudos to her! (I'm a server) anyways she was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions. The food was amazing and so were the drinks. It was a little pricey so it'll probably be a once in a while thing for me when I'm actually in the area or want to bring friends visiting too. Great experience overall! They have a Cute little rum bar too!

I came in to grab a quick bite by myself, The hostess who also was my server was very sweet when I first walked in. I was the only one in the entire restaurant which made it kind of weird but peaceful at the same time. She asked me if I've been in before and I said no, she asked me if I had any questions about anything which I did not because I'm totally obsess with sushi. I ended up ordering two rolls and the gyozas (dumplings) the food came out quick, fresh, and was absolutely delicious. She even remembered to grab me my Sriracha :) I had an overall good experience and will forsure be back. My roommate also had the teriyaki chicken Togo and he love it!

From working for three different five guys locations the staff could use a little more energy. I know what the business is all about because I was a former employee for them back home in California for about three years. They could use some energy! However I'll give them quality on their burgers. Every time we've gone in our burgers were perfect. I usually get no bun and do a lettuce wrap.. their lettuce is on point. Green and fresh! They also aren't stingy with their barbeque sauce!  Yay! My only complaint about the food is the fries. A little soggy and not really fresh. Could use some work on that.   But overall, I love five guys!

Finally had oreganos for the first time and I absolutely loved it! The food was amazing! We had the bruschetta authentico with pesto as an appetizer and oh my gosh! It was so good! I wanted to eat it all but I ordered dinner as well and didn't want to fill up on bread. For dinner I had the El Diablo shrimp pasta and my room mate had the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich was to die for, the chicken was flavorful and crispy and the coleslaw and fries were just perfect. I know this because I ate half of his sandwich due to the fact that I could not eat my pasta! It was way too spicy for me. (I love spicy, and we both agreed that it was pretty Damn spicy) I'm only giving four stars because we also ordered wings as an appetizer as well and we received them after we got our dinner. We only ate one because we were full and over it so we packed them togo. We did order alot of food but I'd rather have microwaved pasta than reheated wings. But other than that everything was great.  Oh! And whoever was bartending that night, kudos to ya because those Moscow mules were on point! So delish and refreshing! I'll definitely be back!

Ahhh after going to numerous different nail salons here in Phoenix I FINALLY found one I love!  Vy nails is awesome,  staff is great and very accommodating. I went back to fix my broken nail and she did it quick, I asked how much was it and she said nothing it was only one nail don't worry. How awesome is that! I still tipped her $5 anyways. I totally recommend this place and surely will be returning!

Not a bad place to go but definitely wouldn't be my first choice of a bar I'd ideally go to. It's convenient to go to watch football however because there are flatscreens everywhere and it is also really close to my apartment. I've been here three times and service isn't bad but it wasn't great. I definitely had to wait about 20 mins to get serve. They aren't very attentive and don't really seem to care much about their guests. We usually sit by the pool table where the bartender can clearly see us yet every time we're there they still seem to ignore us knowing we've been sitting there waiting for a while. Okay I'm a server/bartender I know that even if its not you're section you should still acknowledge your guest. .  Overall Food was good, service was decent and the atmosphere was okay.

Finally after the 3 years I've lived in Phoenix I decided to try culinary dropout! I was not disappointed is all I have to say! And the place is huge! The menu was interesting yet simple, I had a mule which I absolutely loved! It was called pistol something I don't know I forget but it had bourbon and was top with cab! Never had a mile with red wine but I loved it! For an appetizer we had the pretzels and fondue, which was good however our fondue was not warm at all! For our entrees I had the trout which was absolutely delicious! Flavors were on point, &cooked perfect! I forget what kind of nuts were on it which kind of scared me because I'm not a huge fan, but it actually meshed well with the dish! My friend had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, he's a very picky eater and was actually quite impressed with his dinner! We totally would of got dessert but we were stuffed! Our server also was quite lovely, don't know his name but he had a pony tail haha. He was very attentive when he wasn't busy, and was very helpful with the menu.! I'll definitely be back!

I love this place because they are open til 10. I love it even more because the two woman working the night I came in to dine were absolutely adorable and sweet! Reminded me of my mom so much ahha. Didn't speak clear English but didn't fail to give us great service. We came in the last 45 mins before they were closing (I felt bad but I was totally craving Thai food!) All smiles, positive energy, and the food was amazing. Omg the basil fried rice is to die for! I'll definitely be back!
