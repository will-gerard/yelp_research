Yes. YES. YES!  I Ban is the cat's meow when it comes to sushi dining in Phoenix. I typically sway away from the sushi bar seating but the chef here (err - I don't recall his name now!) is excellent. He's fun, funny, spoke with us about what we liked and made great suggestions. It was the best sushi dining experience I've ever had.

Rosita's is THE mexican food restaurant when you're near the 10/51 interchange. Everything is great -- the food, the atmosphere, the service. The salsa is excellent but watch out for the verde, that stuff gets caliente. Fortunately their glasses of water are plenty large.  Tie for favorite items are the shrimp chili rellano plate and the two ground beef and potato tacos. The taco shells, like the chips, are freshly prepared and topped to the brim with lettuce and cheese. Just a very legit mexican dining experience.

We visited Welcome Diner on a Thursday evening and, in all, had a good experience but I can't say I plan to return. Though on the pricey side, the food was good (I had a BBQ pork plate and my guest a burger) and the menu selection seemed adequate. We sat outside and enjoyed our meals, sipping on hurricanes, while appreciating that Welcome Diner is, for lack of a better explanation, a hipsters diner done absolutely right. The food, the service, the facility...all are within a clear and well executed vision. And while I respect that vision, I think that, for me, it was just too much. Specifically, the outdoor seating is more stylish than properly relaxing as their comfort food is. Sitting at a picnic table or some old outdoor furniture that looks like it just came from the back of an old shed is too hipster for me. I get it. I get the theme. I get the execution. It just doesn't work for me. But I would definitely eat their grub if I were in the area looking for take out.

I used to love Pro's but, being slightly out of my way, my trips became less and less often. Then I got a coupon flyer for the *new* Los Altos Ranch Market. I was like, "$5 off a $25 purchase, SAY WHAAAT?" Turns our Pro's had gone into bankruptcy and emerged under the joint ownership of a couple other Hispanic market chains. Fun facts but the coupon got me down there Saturday morning.   Same old Ranch Market with shoes for sale up front, the assortment of prepared food, drink, and bakery items, and chicharones from bite size to mucho grande. I like their produce and meat selection but wish they carried salmon other than the frozen bags. Still, it was a good reminder of the shopping experiences I had before my current battles at my local Fry's and Basha's stores. I suggest we all commit to hitting Ranch Market a little more.

Who doesn't like DQ? And they gave this one a face lift!  Not a lot to say here but I've never had bad service here and the drive thru seems to be always busy so, dozens of ashamed late-night eaters can't be wrong.

Jenny introduced me to Oregano's not long after we started dating. I'm not a big fan of chains or franchises -- even smaller ones -- but I'm also committed to giving any place a chance. Since that rainy day introduction some (three?) years ago, I've never really had a 'bad' Oregano's experience. But, that being said, part of the Oregano's experience is the long dining time which, on a weekend, generates longer waits for a table. So that's Oregano's.   The Camelback location has been our 'home' Oregano's since we moved to Phoenix. The parking here is a little tight and you'll often find yourself pulling up to the curb on one of the streets behind the restaurant. But the staff is great and there is adequate seating for your pre-meal wait. That all said, my go-to here is the meatball sub or the Big Bambino salad. The BigBam is sooooooo good and I like that the portions are sized to share.

Look, I'm not from Chicago but I try to get CHI dogs anywhere I can. The Great Dane is an excellent offering when you are in Uptown Phoenix. The service has always been friendly and the food right on the mark.

TEXAZ is my local steakhouse and I finally got to try it! My brother and I arrived about 7:30p and opted to sit at the bar. The interior is awesome. Just a fun old Texas steakhouse right here in the heart of Uptown Phoenix. All kinds of crazy crap on the walls, great service, and awesome grub.  I get that parking in there is a pain but there are plenty of open spaces across Bethany on the SE corner of the intersection. When you consider how far people walk when they have to park, for example, downtown or at the Biltmore -- TEXAZ is probably actually a shorter walk from your vehicle. Just a point is all.  Anyways, the bartender (whose name I can't recall - shucks) was great. I told her it was my first time and she walked me through the menu and highlighted the chicken fried steak (their specialty) and the prime rib. I ordered the large prime rib and it was excellent. I have also tried the chicken fried steak and, while rich, it's also very good. Just all around, nothing but good things to say about TEXAZ Grill.  Plus you get little glasses for your beer. What a novelty.

Jenny introduce me to Cost Plus when I moved to Phoenix. Prior to coming here, the only one I knew of was a CP in Tucson that was perpetually going out of business. What a surprise it was to find a fully function CP on Camelback!  Love the coffee and wine selection (and pricing). As nearly everyone else has mentioned, you're going to go in with a list and walk out with everything you were looking for and then some. If you ever get the chance, btw, pick up some of their fun furniture knobs. We used them on a bar we refinished and they made the PERFECT touch.

Normally when I visit Ulta, I'm serving only as Jenny's arm candy and bag carrier. She seems to know what she's doing (until she gets off track -- but that's like me at Home Depot so all good) and, aside from the perpetual checkout line (which I see others have posted about) the experience is pretty painless.   But when she handed me some container of some stuff and asked me to swing by Ulta to pick up another one, I figured this place would take care of me no problem. I mean, I did have the exact product I wanted to purchase. But from the moment I walked it, I felt invisible. There were plenty of employees but, aside from the ones who were helping customers, the rest were inconveniently (or, conveniently for them) in accessible. When I finally eyed a free body down the aisle, she slipped off the floor.  Finally I decided to wait by the counter in the middle because it seemed like the most likely place to be clear that I was not just browsing. During my wait there though, I happened to stumble upon the product. Even as I stood there for a moment, verifying that this was indeed THE EXACT ITEM I BROUGHT IN THE STORE, no one approached me. Come on -- I had to look confused. I'm some dude at Ulta who doesn't belong in Ulta. Get me in, get me served, get my money, and get me on my way. I know this isn't Victoria's Secret but help a brother out!

So even if I did have a serious issue with Sky Harbor, what am I gonna do? Use the other airport in the middle of Phoenix? Fortunately, I come from Tucson so  pretty much any airport is an upgrade by my standards. Fun fact: In We're the Millers, the 'family' flies into Tucson International Airport but the scene is shot in ABQ (same airport in Breaking Bad). So, that's how bad TIA is - even when the script calls for Tucson to be shown, filmmakers go to another state to put something palatable on the screen.   That said, I actually like Sky Harbor. I wish the Sky Train was a little more consistent (maybe it's just been down when I had flights to catch) but the place is efficient enough and that's really all I can ask for. That they keep it clean and are putting in some decent restaurants is just icing on the cake.

I know I am the only one, but I'm just not a kid guy. I'm mostly a XBox-Call-of-Duty-With-My-Dogs-Around guy or, if I'm in a good mood, a be-around-my-girlfriend-guy. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate those who do have kids -- there are plenty more cocktails than mine that we could stand to pass down in the gene pool -- but I can't relate. So when Jeff and Jocelyn told me they'd be in town Saturday morning and wanted to meet up, I immediately checked my five start Yelp list. Mimosa's here, bloody mary's there -- or maybe just beeline it to the strip club.  "Helen and Amelia are excited to see Jenny." pretty much blew up any plans I would be able to put together.   Enter: The Farm at South Mountain. Fresh air, green grass, and space for the kids to run around/fall/eat dirt (or whatever they do) while the adults could catch up. There's really nothing else like it in Phoenix. I highly recommend a visit on a cool spring morning.

Only a handful of reviews but the high rating is well-deserved, if you ask this third time pedicure veteran. My girlfriend had lived in Ahwatukee and suggested I join her for her monthly pedicure last November. Besides being a guy with 30 years of callous flesh buildup and toenail neglect hidden by my Triforce slip-ons that I did not want to expose to this gal I was trying to court (the scene from Dumb and Dumber playing in my head as we pulled into the parking lot the first time), my bigger concern was the simple expectation of sitting in a grungy strip mall salon (like those next to the discount pho restaurants I frequent) being worked on by a bunch of women criticizing my neglected hooves.       None of the above at Presto (full disclosure: it IS in a strip mall space). Besides the acetone whiff when you walk in, the salon and the staff make for a very pleasant and inviting experience. The salon is bright and new and always seems clean. The staff is very friendly and, as others have mentioned, Tom the owner is a very nice guy and very respectful. Each time I have had a different pedicurist and they are all friendly and attentive. I see them engaged with customers who do like to talk a lot (I know my three experiences are a limited sample but this is usually fat old ladies) and pretty much just leaving alone the quieter ones (like myself) who just like to play with the chair's massage settings.   Many others seems to think like me because they've always been busy and most of the customers talk to the staff like regulars. Frankly, I think I am spoiled by Presto and am not even interested in trying out another salon.

Tag's is a small town diner. They carry all the classics (omelettes, sandwiches, burgers) as well as simple takes on regional items (read: mexican food). The service is friendly and the serving ware is always clean. I have a hard time asking for much more than that when this is the best club sandwich for 30 miles.

Our most recent Fleming's visit brought us to the Scottsdale location. I had called a couple hours in advance to check on their expected availability and the hostess was a step ahead, offering to help me set a reservation. Once we arrived, all the service was excellent. McKenna, our server, was perfect. Friendly, warm, professional -- of course the food was great but service like hers is what made this a worthwhile outing.   We had a couple drinks, the calamari (good -- on the sweet side but that is how they advertise it), loaded baked potato, steaks, lobster tail, and the lava cake (GET THE LAVA CAKE IT IS TOO MUCH BUT YOU'LL BE SO GLAD YOU DID!). Everything was great. Honestly, I was actually a little surprised because chain places tend to slip somewhere but Fleming's was on point.

I initially got turned on to Healthy Habit as a distributor for raw milk. It's a hit and miss proposition on that item but -- jeeze -- the story has like everything. Anytime I need a supplement or vitamin, The Habit is my go-to spot. The service is great with a knowledgeable (but not condescending) and friendly staff. I honestly don't even have a #2 to this place -- Healthy Habit is as good as it gets!

Jeez Chevron, how many billions in tax breaks do you need to have your minimart open at 4pm? If we make it a trillion, can I approach the doors without some stoner kid telling me it's closed a scribbled "be back shortly" on the door?  Guess you can buy their overpriced gas with a credit card.

We went for dinner on a Sunday after arriving to Sedona and thought the restaurant may have nice views. It was basically empty and we were seated on the patio where we could enjoy the fantastic views. The food was good but the menu is pricey and the service was terribly slow in every stage - taking our order, delivering our meals, filling our waters, and presenting the check. The staff was nice but just not generally attentative.   Next time we are in town, we'll try out some of the other restaurants and pass on this one.

Jenny and I were all over this Starbucks when we were staying in Henderson earlier this month. For my two cents, I gave up on Starbucks when they, as a member of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (along with Kelloggs, Monsanto, etc), sued the state of Vermont in an attempt to prevent their GMO labeling legislation. In fact, I'm losing my gold card in a couple weeks because I didn't have enough visits over the last 12 months to maintain my status.   That said, Jenny loves Starbucks and, when you're on vacation in a foreign land and don't have a better suggestion for nearby afternoon coffee (and wifi), you visit Starbucks. Admittedly, this is on the nicer end too. It's spacious, clean, service is friendly, and the large patio area was wonderful in early March (I doubt I'd cheer for it in another month though).    5 star service/facility + 0 star corporate integrity

I'm sorry but I cannot NOT give this place five stars. I know it's hood. I know it's cash only. I know it's host to many shady shady characters. I know this because I can't stop going back. It's all in the Jimmy Jack's experience!   I'll tell you this. I've never been accosted by anyone here. The food has always been hot and the prices are a value. The ladies who work the window have always been friendly and prompt. And I've always been able to find parking and a place to sit here. What's there not to like?

You know the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld? I like to keep that in mind when I do my Yelp reviews because, while the rating system is a simple one to five stars, you really aren't reviewing all restaurants on the same variables.   Diamond's needs to be rated amongst authentic discount Chinese food restaurants. I give it four stars with the understanding that Diamond's is not:  - romantic - a place to meet my girlfriend's parents for the first time - charming  Is it authentic? Maybe. How would I know? I can say that it's a value where you get a lot of good for an inexpensive price. The decor isn't impressive but they don't claim it is. Specials are written on florescent poster board lining the restaurant.   Service is slow and inconsistent though -- so less a star. But I stand firm that, if you like Chinese food and you are hungry, then this is the place to go.

We hit up First Watch this morning and my first thought was, "boy! what a popular joint!" The wait was quoted at 10-15 minutes but we were seated in else than ten. Service was excellent. Jenny enjoyed the waffle breakfast and I had an Acapulco Express omelette. Both were good and we cleared out plates, sipping on the coffee (caution: it's a strong brew) to wrap up our casual Saturday breakfast.  Not a lot of bells and whistles but First Watch seems to know what they're doing. Definitely a safe bet if you're looking for a dependable weekend breakfast stop.

I headed here to grab a gift on my way to a bachelor party. I knew a bad whiskey from a decent one but needed some help navigating a higher echelon of malts. After reading the reviews, I was surprised to see how cluttered the store was. Definitely a step up from your typical corner mart but not a place that I would have expected any sort of service, based on the clutter and selection.   I explained my situation and was introduced to a range of whiskeys behind the counter. Props to the store for stocking those options at all but other than, "older is better and more expensive", our communication kind of stalled. Then again - maybe there was nothing else to say. "Yeah this goes down smooth with that titty glitter you're going to be choking on while you and your brahs enjoy ABCO tonight"?  So I was pleased enough with my visit. Don't think I'd return for advice on what bottles I need to stock my bar but props for the employees being friendly, knowledgable -enough, and knowing what is in stock.

I've twice been to Alta Vista, once for a routine 'MY LITTLE ANGEL HAS A COUGH!' check up and once, unfortunately, for an emergency. In addition to their great hours, their front desk staff has always been friendly and helpful in setting up appointments, answering questions, and discussing where I might find the cheapest price on my dogs' prescriptions.  I saw Dr Capozzi on my first visit and, when my emergency rolled around a few months later, I asked if she was available to treat my dog because she had some familiarity with him. Unfortunately, she was working nights but Dr Peterson was in the office. I can't give enough kudos to Dr Peterson for the way she handled my situation. In retrospect, while it was an urgent matter, my dog probably wasn't having the kind of immediate emergency that vets regularly deal with. Still, Dr Peterson didn't blow off my reactions and, frankly, really took control. I appreciate that she listened to me explaining all the details I could share (probably numerous times) and explaining the process to me.    My dog ended up staying with their clinic for a day and I never worried that he wasn't cared for. When I visited him that evening, a tech came in and shared an abundance of data with me and really seemed to be familiar with my dog, rather than just reading off a chart. I was able to take him home the next day and received follow up calls from their office, including one direct from Dr Peterson, inquiring about my dog's recovery. On top of all this, I'll say the price is typical there which, for their service, is a steal.   As good as it gets, indeed.

Mi Patio is good. For the area that it is in, I find it strange that there isn't more competition in Mexican food. I guess I could head deeper into the aves but, as a rule of thumb, I don't associate the Avenues with solutions.   From the outside, I was concerned that we were walking into a canned beans, store-bought hard taco shells, overpriced experience. In retrospect, this is probably due to the Corona theme on the outside of the building that made me think of all the substandard Mexican joints in Tempe that survive off the binge drinking college crowd. So, shame on me for such judgement - authentic Mexican doesn't have to come from a rundown brink building in a south Phoenix barrio.  Promptly seated, the service was attentive and the food was good. I got my panfried taco shell (complete with bubbled sides - muy authentico!) and left fat and happy. I think Mi Patio may be our new go-to Mexican place when we don't want to drive all the way to the South Phoenix Barrio.

All things considered, this is the midtown theater I'd frequent any day of the week. Pricing is less than the AMCs and specialty theaters and the facility is updated and well kept. Sure -- there is no lobby bar or in-theater service -- but it does the trick. Besides, with the movies being released these days, it's usually the studio's fault if I have a bad film-going experience.   I'm sure most Yelpers don't make a point to ride their bikes to Christown but, as another poster mentioned, they do not offer bike parking near the theater entrance. It'd be ideal if they'd offer something like a bike rack near the ticket booth (at least) for guests but I doubt that's gonna happen anytime soon.

If I were one of those reviewers who had to give you a bunch of background about myself, why my review should carry more weight than others due to some kind of arbitrary expertise, and how I came to visit the establishment that time, I would tell you that I only recently moved to the area and, after trying Pho Tahn less than a couple months ago, I've been on a pho kick and that, while I don't know good pho, I do know what I like. My expertise, then, comes from a history of enjoying big cauldrons of soups/stews when temperatures drop below 80 and, oftentimes, enjoying menudo to fend off hangovers (those my last menudo bowl for such necessity was years ago, thank goodness). By virtue of trying to visit Pho Tahn on it's day off, I tried Da Vang and, frankly, was pleased enough to continue you going there. Alas, Friday night I was running late and it wasn't going to be feasible for us to make Da Vang before they closed and, after a phone call to Pho Tahn revealed that they are closed for unexplained reasons until the middle of December, I decided to try my luck even deeper into the avenues and try Maxim with it's liberal 8:45p closing time.   After missing the restaurant on our first shot (it doesn't really face 19th Ave, the strip mall faces north so it's tough to see if you are coming from Osborne), we parked and entered. As others have noted, the place is extremely clean which was a pleasant surprise and the server was very nice, pointing out, for example, if whitey orders any dishes with tripe/tendon. The food is good and the dishes at the tables around us, who had not ordered pho, looked very good.   In short, I'd say it's a toss up between Maxim and Da Vang -- and that's a good thing. Both are 5-star Pho places and that is good enough for me.

We'd also like to rant about how great Pepe's is. From our first visit, hungover after a night of Dbacks and Amsterdam, when I introduced Jenny to menudo (girl is from Arizona and had never menudo'd as a hangover remedy, can you believe it?) to yesterday, our first visit since going vegetarian, Pepe's is consistent. Prices, food, and service are all good and that's all anyone should be asking for in the Avenues.

So here's the deal. Da Vang is a 5-star restaurant. Now, maybe not a AAA Destinations Monthly or Arizona Highways Magazine 5-star restaurant -- but a 5-star if you're a normal person who understands a pho restaurant in the Avenues is going to have some semblance of a pho restaurant in the Avenues.   Now, we visited Da Vang on a day we had a pho hankering and Pho Tan was closed. Here is the scoop -- both places are good; Da Vang is better. Especially for sit down because their staff provides much better service. It's as simple as that.  Else, about $20 for two orders of pho, two rolls, two drinks. Can not be beat.

Kwan and Wok is EXACTLY what you expect when you pull in to the tiny strip mall on the NW corner of Camelback and 17th Ave. Anchoring the weird parking layout and a bunch of asian stores (including a grocery and Pho restaurant), entering K&W is like stepping into any private chinese fast food/to-go restaurant in the United States. A cooler with soda by the can, non-descript beige walls, and only the humming of the fan greet you upon entrance. When I was in Tucson, Tokyo Rice Bowl was my standby for years. After only moments in K&W, I knew I was home. When the first guy who came out to take my order barely understood english, my knees quivered with memories of some of the best dining experiences of my life coming from a little white foldy top container.   I don't know why I even looked at the menu. I've looked at chinese to-go restaurant menus across the United States. I know what they offer. You know what they offer. They know what they offer. Our order of spring rolls, orange chicken, and house chow mein (and a can of Pepsi, of course) -- which, of course, came with white rice -- was right on par.  K&W is the real deal. When you feel like good old fashioned American-style chinese food, this is the only place to light rail.

I am a big proponent of The Original Wineburger and, I'm not going to lie, I fear it may some day become a very cool place. ::Shutters::  It's a decades-old bar that bills itself as 'the original husband day care'. Now, I'm no husband but I know a good place to camp out for a few hours and watch the game while enjoying some good ol' fashioned bar food.   The service is great and the establishment is clean. You can see they take pride in the establishment. In all, if you are looking for a place to escape the honey-do's for a few hours on Sunday, TOW is the place for you.

Mariscos Chihuahua has always seemed to me like.a seafood Filiberto's. I always see them on the side of the road, generally in shadier areas, with that signature blue roof and a busy parking lot. Still, I'd never met anyone who had actually gone to Mariscos.   Is there a Yelp Whitey Badge? If so, I just unlocked it.  Jenny and I were in the mood for fish tacos but had no patience for the kind to crap Rubios or these other Mexican places try to pass off as over-breaded, deep-fried, fish sticks in a tortilla. We wanted good good seafood and, damn it, if anyplace was going to be able to hit that mark, it was going to be a place named Mariscos.  We parked in the back and entered the small shop with a man at the counter and a couple eating in the corner. I think a man and woman were the only people working. She took our drink orders and discussed any questions we had on the menu.  We ended up with some shrimp tacos, fish tacos, and seafood cocktail dishes. All were excellent. I have to say, we are now Mariscos fans por siempre!

I've never met Walt but I have to imagine he's proud of his Ace, and he should be. You know, Ace is the always the "little pricier but good service" store and, for my two cents, the service is worth it. Don't get me wrong, if I'm just buying a board or a shovel, I can get it cheaper elsewhere and I can handle it myself. But when I have to get nuts/bolts/fasteners -- just stupid little items that I can find on my own but would rather just have someone help me -- Ace is my destination of choice. They've got great floor employees who are always able to help me (even if it means asking another employee for support) and that's actually very refreshing.

Who reviews a Savers, right? Not me, typically, but this one made enough of an impression on me (a positive one, fortunately) that I felt compelled to Yelp it.   Granted, I visited with low expectations but when I walked in on Saturday morning to check out their wares, I first taken back by how it didn't have that thrift store smell. I hate the smell. The floor space is considerable and most of the displays seemed to be good condition items (including the standard thrift store Halloween offerings) which made browsing kitchen items a little less draining.   Prices were on target, the store was clean, and the staff was friendly. Definitely worth the [unexpected] trip.

Here's the down low - if you are craving a late evening (why do they close so early?) DQ fix, it'll be quicker to drive to this location and order than to wait in line at the Central and Camelback location. This service isn't the fastest in the world, but it's quick enough and, coupled with the shorter queue, you'll be on your way quicker than if you'd not made the gutsy call to travel into the Avenues for some ice cream treats.  The other benefit, they give you more Blizzard mix ins here. Don't ask me why, don't ask me how - but it's true.

Big fan of this Food City. I mean, I'm a FC guy in the first place but this is on the 'higher end of Food City' (is this even a thing?). It's clean, the staff is helpful, and they actually man the check out lines (a surprisingly rare feature in so many uptown supermarkets).   Sure, you aren't going to find your Torini Syrup here -- but they got pork snout. So venture across the 17, if you are feeling sporty, to try the best supermarket experience in the area.

The two cons for Mariscos Ensenada is the loud music (there is no escape in the dining room) and long wait to get paid and get out.   That said, it's a quality mariscos experience. A little on the pricey side but, hey, I don't always need the cheapest seafood. Cleaning up the two items listed above, it was a fine experience. Food was good, service was friendly and fast, and the place was clean. Give it a try if you've got that Mariscos hankerin'.

Not a whole lot to be said for this Home Depot. It's about the only game in the area and they seem to know it. In the trips I've made here, I've only been in and out when I didn't need to interact with the staff -- and, even then, I've been delayed 10+ minutes bc their spray paint cans didn't have the HD UPC stickers, resulting in three employees getting involved.   You're probably going here but, you know, just have an idea of what you are in for.

We took an Uber to the Fiesta Bowl and our driver pointed out Kiss The Cook as the best breakfast spot in Glendale. Not that I was looking, but KTC had not even been on my restaurant radar. Now, I'll be the first to criticize the Yelp community for having 400+ reviews of 'hip' breakfast joints but it's pulling teeth to get info on certain businesses or restaurants off the beaten path (generating user-content Yelpers, c'mon!) but not being aware of KTC and it's 100+ reviews is entirely on me there, friends.   There was a short wait when we showed up from estate saleing on Saturday morning but the staff was friendly and had us in shortly. I had the New Orleans Omelette and Jenny had the special with the Maple Sausage. All the food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the prices were reasonable. Not a lot of bells and whistles (the mini muffins are a wonderful touch) but KTC is an elite down home breakfast restaurant.   I can't stress enough how much every other "country kitchen" type restaurant can learn from KTC. Understated and over-performing if how I'd describe KTC. It's not the place I'll take my trendy out of town DINK friends after a night at [insert popular Scottsdale club with 600+ Yelp reviews], but it'll definitely be an upgrade for my Cracker Barrel & Denny's dining parents when they come to town.

My family is full of big eaters and we used to all do a big Christmas at my Grandparents' house in Vegas. After attending Midnight Mass with my mom one year, we were driving home and gave each other that shameful look. I ask ashamed, "Are you hungry?" She looked back, more ashamed because she was the adult, "Yeah." So we hit Blueberry Hill and had a Alaskan Waffle...each. My love of the restaurant was born.  For out of towners, visiting BH should be a tradition unlike any other. The Yelp description of a five-star is dead on: "Whoohoo! As good as it gets!" BH should be the standard by which every chain breakfast place compares themselves. A conventional breakfast haus, the food is good, the servings are large, the pries are fair, and the service is great.  Go to Blueberry Hill. It's not far off the strip and you'll feel a hell of a lot better grabbing a breakfast there (and getting away from the Strip).

So this was a bit of a shocker -- as Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has become a breakfast staple on our Las Vegas trips (got to get off the strip for waffles and ice scream), when we pulled up to this one, shame on me, I'd Yelp'd the wrong location. Apparently we usually visit the location just west on Flamingo. How could this be a big deal though? It's a local chain diner.   I don't know where this location went wrong, but everything was a considerable step below the BHFR I expected. The coffee, just warm. The service, noticeably slow (at every step). The food, not quite to snuff (very little butter on our pancakes, eggs were cooler than the rest of our dish, and some very fatty bacon).   Of course I'd try again on the name alone -- but it won't be at this location.

Out after a Friday baseball game with another couple, we were loaded up quite well and the ladies decided Amsterdam was the logical place to go. Of course -- Cooperstown, Dbacks, Amsterdam! Being in my fan gear (Sedona Red jersey and slip ons), I was somewhat hesitant about not being 'hip' to their 'vibe' at Amerstam. Then Jenny reminded me that Charlies had charged her a cover but let me in for free, so I was sold.  We arrived about 9pm and the doorman was very friendly, asking about the game and checking our IDs. We spent most of our visit on the spacious patio having drinks until hitting the dance floor and leaving. As others have mentioned, they seem to not stock some typical ingredients (we had a round of white russians with soy milk) but, as an adult, I'd use this as an opportunity to try a different take on a favorite or something new altogether (we had absinthe -- it was gross and I felt like crap the next day).

Here's the thing about Pizzeria Bianco, it's very good. If there was no wait (I mean, you can go during off hours, sure) it'd be fantastic. Realistically, you need to plan on including the wait as part of your weekend dinner outing. If you're in a rush, move along. If you're looking for an 'experience', PB will do you right.   The pizzas are all excellent and I've never had a bad item, dirty plate, or subpar service here. The place is fantastic. The only knock against the name is that it was watered down by lowering itself to a location in Tucson -- but the REAL Pizzeria Bianco, the original, on Adams is as timeless a dining experience as there has ever been.

I often comment that Phoenix only has pro sports teams so all the transplants can go see their hometown teams come play here once a year. I also comment that, while not all Dodger fans are violent criminals, all violent criminals are Dodger fans. Both statements are accurate.  The stadium, which I refuse to refer by the title name of a bailed out bank, is new and, while I appreciate older stadiums and outdoor arenas, the fact of the matter is that I want to be comfortable if I am going to a baseball game. Could it be better, absolutely. Is it a generic ballpark with faux bricks and highlights mainly regarding the history of 'the game'? Yes. But, hey, it is what it is. Ball games are expensive and that's what you get when you go.  I like that it is off the rail, the stadium is well-laid out, and the climate is controlled. I just wish they would put some local restaurants in place of their generic concession stands. The food is just horrible and that would be a huge upgrade for them. But so would another World Series title.

Lux is great. Set up with all the features than many-an-establishment might use to send off a douchey hipster vibe, Lux is as inviting as any other coffee shop I've visited. The staff is always friendly, the coffee is excellent, and, as an avid people watcher, it has a great atmosphere.  Seating can get restrictive but, generally, they've utilized their space well so I can't fault them for their popularity. The only knock would be that the music is sometimes turned up a bit loud -- but if that's the worst it has going for it, then I guess it truly is...."as good as it gets [five stars]"

Have to agree with many others who don't feel Monte Carlo fits the AAA 4-star ranking the hotel boasts (the rooms don't even have the La Quinta-standard hair driers). We just finished checking in and, though the staff has been friendly, it was frustrating to find out our reserved room with a king bed was not available and we were put in a room with two queens. Considering we reserved online directly through MC, one would think that we would be guaranteed the room that we reserved and called to check on earlier today. Kind of an immediate 'back-to-earth' event that reminds you you're just another customer, not the 'valued guest' that they try to sell. They said they would move us tomorrow but, now, that gives us one more 'to-do' at the hotel when we would rather be out exploring the area.

Been to Delux a couple times on gourmet burger hankering. With a side of fries and a big selection of drafts (and misc comfort desserts/drinks), Delux delivers. There is a cool atmosphere, friendly service, and good food.  One item of note, they advertise Niman Ranch Beef, which many see as grass-fed. Their's is specifically listed as grain fed. So, while the treatment of the animals is still better than typical factory facilities, the diet isn't the same as grass fed. Hey, we can all make our own choices, it just kind of perturbs me to see "vegetarian fed" advertised when it is a non-issue -- grass fed is the standard.

Just a note: the address listed on here is for the Echo Canyon side. Both trails go to same peak but Echo is the steeper route. Echo has limited parking with no street parking in the area so get there early or just be prepared in case parking is a challenge. If it's winter time and you're thinking about starting at like 10am, you may want to go hike the Cholla trail from the east -- at least you'll be able to park somewhere along road.  That said, Camelback is a classic weekend morning hike in Phoenix. It's challenging but short with lots of places for photos (if that's your thing). A great hike for when you have visitors because the views of the Valley are great. I like the Echo side as well because most of the trail is pretty wide so, if you are booking it (like myself), you can move at your own pace. If you're feeling up for a bit of a challenge, the mountain can be yo-yo'd, for which I highly recommend starting on Echo.   I live in uptown Phoenix so Squaw and Camelback are my favorite nearby hikes. Definitely worth doing because, when you go to brunch afterwards, everyone you meet up with will say, "Oh I love that hike! I need to get out there and do it again soon!"

I'd been to CIbo a couple times and had good impressions. Yeah, it's on the pricier side but I wouldn't argue if you said the pizza challenged for the best in the valley. Service had always been pretty much par and the whole experience just kind of enjoyable. Then I saw the reviews on here (1200+ -- so why am I even bothering with mine?) and was really glad I hadn't Yelped Cibo first.  Look, the food is good and the atmosphere is inviting. Really, it's good. But it's a restaurant. It's got a small space and you are going to get the fallbacks that come with a popular and small place. Now, I know some people feel like they aren't going to a worthwhile establishment if they aren't waiting -- I disagree. But I will say this is -- if you are looking for a good dining experience, Cibo is there. If you're looking for the out of this world experience that some Yelpers have had, I can't provide a roadmap for that.

I like Fez. Off the light rail, it's got a good location, plenty of parking, and a great vibe, but for some reason it always seems empty. Why I've never had to wait for a table, I don't know, but I guess I won't complain.  The food is good at Fez (Jenny likes the chicken sandwich thing; I like the hummus appetizer) and the service, as others have mentioned, is always great. While I don't go there weekly or anything, it's always in my pocket as a go-to when a friend is visiting and we end up needing to grab a meal.

Carly's is a great little joint. It isn't much from the outside but the service is always good and the patio is wonderful on cool evenings (the few we have). We've sampled different items here and I've been most impressed by their vegan wrap. Drink selection is also more-than-adequate. I'd recommend giving it a shot if you are in the area.

I'm sitting here on a Wednesday evening completely in awe of this library (by Arizona standards anyways). Having only visited the Yucca branch to date, I was immensely impressed by the architecture here. But, then again, it's downtown so it should be nicer.   I can see how the hobos can overrun this joint -- there were plenty in the park on my way in. Good with the bad, I guess. Still, I'm glad I've changed up my reserve dropoff from Yucca to here.

Disclaimer: I don't know coffee or espresso. I mean, I can tell if something is burnt to hell or completely the wrong temperature but I'm no ex-barrista who can comment on how hot the creme is being made or to what extent the froth should be added. I just like the decor and, now that the weather has cooled, sitting on the couches with the garage doors lifted.  That said, Copper Star is a quality local coffee shop. As another poster mentioned, the employees are very friendly which, as a coffee knownothing, I appreciate in a small coffee shop.  The baked good are excellent, if a tad pricey. The options seem to rotate but I haven't been let down yet. If you are looking for something a little more substantial, I highly recommend the hummus plate.   As I am quickly becoming a regular, I wish they had some kind of punch card program -- oh well.

I had to update my rating to a full 5-stars for C-Star. Jenny and I have been consistently going there for nearly a year and neither of us has ever had a subpar visit. Seriously, they don't ever have an off day. I usually go weekday mornings -- never a problem. Jenny typically visits in the afternoons -- always treated well. More often than not, we go together on a weekend and lounge in the patio misters or on the big orange couches -- always a positive experience. The coffee is the best in the area (we recommended St Francis look to Copper Star to brew up b/c the reject grounds from Cartel are not cutting it) and the service is always excellent. The baked good and food selections make it just that much better. If this were the RenFaire, I'd be totally HUZZAH for Copper Star.

Fake College Stadium is a premium place to watch a game. With the roll out pitch, the retractable roof, and great seating layouts, this is the place to be. Get there for an event when it is at capacity and that place gets rocking. How does St Louis even still have a team with that dump-ass dome?

Piestewa is a nice little in-town hike. It isn't long but it has some serious elevation gain for those looking to get in a work out. Very popular (especially in the winter and on weekends) parking is the real limiter here. I hike at a brisk speed and have never had a serious problem with the trail being too crowded but the parking lot is just its own monster. I recommend getting in early or...well, I don't know a better option.   Still, if you have company in from out of town, it's a great 'things to do' (if you can get them out of bed early) with a [basically] all skill levels hike and quality 360 views of the valley.  There are some sister hikes to the main peak that, admittedly, I've never done. Just not really interested -- maybe one of these days.

I was first introduced to Joe's years ago when I worked near Coolidge and, when getting burnt out, would need the occasional three-hour lunch. It was great then and is still a worthwhile stop when I make it out to the east valley. Going down the strip that is downtown Gilbert, it's funny to see our CenPhx favorites -- Joyride, Postinos, et al -- right there. It probably wouldn't translate as well, but I sure would love to see a Joe's in non-airport Phoenix.   My personal recommendation is the stuffed baker. All the menu items are great (really just some various combination of the bbq items that highlight the menu) but I like the baker because, hey, there's nowhere else I dine that I order the baked potato entrees (seriously, check my lists -- you'll see no 'Best Baked Potatoes in Phoenix' here!).  Always a tip of the hat to Joe's service and atmosphere. Just a great restaurant and I highly recommend giving it, at least, one shot.

When it comes to vintage stores, Qcumberz is near the bottom of my list. It's a lot of, frankly, junk. Of course, to each his own but more often than not I leave shaking my head thinking, "oh yeah, this is why I haven't been here in so long."   That said, they have some unique items that are definitely not in the same vein as the other shops on Melrose. I can see when this is good though, like I said, for me it's been a negative. If you've got the time though, feel free to check it out. You can definitely do worse.

I've traveled the shops on the Melrose Curve and Figs is my favorite visit. Yeah - their prices are up there, as others have said, but I appreciate their selection. Whereas I find many of the other antique shops on 7th just load on cheaply veneered 80's furniture (also known as, simply 80's furniture...ugh), Figs' offering include unique statuettes, wall hangings, and [for lack of a better word] knick knacks.

We hit El Torito on our way out of Vegas and, being Sunday morning, it was almost a relief to see the unassuming exterior as we could be assured that there would be no wait. We were correct and found ourselves promptly seated in a dated mexican food restaurant. Food was good, service was good, and prices were fair -- only ding is that they messed up Jenny's order (I suspect the server didn't ask for clarification when she was confused).  Definitely a worthwhile stop if you have a half-day drive back to Arizona or California ahead of you.

Fuego Bistro is a five-star experience all the way. Yes it is a touch on the pricey side but everything is excellent. The patio is gorgeous (though maybe not the best summer bet) and the inside has a great decor. All the food and drinks are fantanstic -- I haven't found an item yet that isn't outstanding. Yeah the parking situation could be a little better but, really, I have nothing bad to say about the place. FB is an uptown gem and I'm so glad to have it in my pocket for when visitors who "know the Valley" show up and think they're going to get the same ol' dining experience.  Mas kudos to Fuego Bistro. You are outstanding.

Oh man I saw Gravity there in 3D and it was insane. I can't remember the last time I was so enthralled in a film. I know that says a lot more about the film than the theater but hey, it's my review.  That said, the Esplande is nice. It has the bar inside and the dine-in theater option. I've found the staff to always be helpful and courteous. Of course the food is movie theater food so don't get too excited about the dining portion of the experience if you go that way (and pricey!).  Jenny and I have been together for a while so we're fine at Harkins. But if you're looking for a primo cinema experience, Esplanade is the joint for you.

Coming from Tucson, this is about the nicest dog park I have ever seen. Spacious and grassy (such a concept!) with ample parking right outside the dog park. We've been going here for about 6 mo. now and I would generalize the owners here as responsible with their pets and the cleanup. Sure, there can be some outliers, but I always feel relaxed having my dogs here.  When the big dog park floods out (how hard it is for the city to just put in a drain, I don't understand), everyone goes to the small dog park and I've never seen an issue or even a concerned small dog owner face. I can be a bit of a pain with traffic, as the parking is only off of 7th St, but otherwise there is no reason to pick anywhere else.

We finally made it down to Fattoush and it was everything I had hoped for. Good food, good service, and good prices. I think we got to sample a little of everything at our table and everything was up to par. Did I mention attentive service? How does this place not have a Yelp Loves Us sticker on their door?

This is just a rounded-up 1.5 star rating because Jenny will not budge and meet me at two stars. Guess a tie goes to the business.  So little to say about the service at this Fry's. On our Saturday morning visit, there were customer lines EVERYWHERE. Customer service, check out, and even the Starbucks. But employees, of which there were many, were in pairs and threes having conversations on the middle of the floor including right at the entrance where entering patrons were forced to maneuver around carts and employees setting up oversized flower displays.

This Starbucks is losing it. I don't go there that often but, as Jenny and I were waiting (and waiting....and waiting) in the drive thru last weekend, I asked her if she'd noticed it seemed to have gotten worse and she agreed. We recanted our recent experiences at this location -- long waits and incorrect orders mostly (which is about all Starbucks is) -- while we waited. Then, when our drinks came and we pulled away, lo and behold, our orders were wrong.  Filter the reviews by date and you can see the same trend with the latest reviews. I don't know how this one got so off the mark but, man, it's just a head scratcher.

Staff at this Walgreens is friendly, the selection is good, and the store is clean. Yeah you're gonna get hit up for money walking in -- just wave them off. The pharmacy is efficient and I've had good service at the photo counter getting a passport photo taken.   All in all, this is what all Walgreens really should be.

We've come to know this location as Bad Fry's even though such a connotation suggests there must be a 'Good Fry's' somewhere. Just off the light rail, anchoring a shopping center with a McDonald's and a Verizon store, this store is truely ghetto.    Con: EVERYONE constantly hitting you up for money in the parking lot. I'm serious - I've had ladies come up to me as I am getting in my car ("Excuse me...how are you doing? Hi....I'm trying to.....") and after I immediately wave them off and tell them no, they turn and get in the vehicle parked right next to me! There is no shame amongst these people.  Pro: These people will sell you thier SNAP benefits for pennies on the dollar. Cash is king and there is a Wells Fargo with an ATM just inside the store. Stick it to the manufactured food lobbyists by using those food stamps for fresh produce (their produce isn't horrible)!   ____________________  Pro: They put a Starbucks inside the store. Right when you walk in. Very convenient for when you know you're going to need to brave these narrow aisles with a cart. There is even a little sitting area with tables and a television.  Con: The seating area is full of parking lot people and often stinks to high hell. Also, people don't seem to get not leaving their carts right in the way, so if you enter and head towards the produce, there will likely be carts which have been left right in the way.  ____________________  In all, it's a dump. But it's a bit of a food desert over there (AJ's doesn't count) for groceries so, I guess, if you need to grab a gallon of milk and have a few bucks for a guy who is trying to catch the bus to get across town and can spare ten dollars to help some lady out with her, I don't know probably liquor, then you'll have a good time at Bad Fry's.

We've been to St Francis plenty of times but figured it was finally due time to review. We had a wonderful waiter, Andrew, who took care of us from the get-go for our Sunday brunch visit in late January. Friendly, helpful, and had no problem confirming that the guy next to our table was the teacher from Glee. Eeeeeeeeeee.....status update! With Spring Training in town, the weather and people watching is perfect for hitting St Francis for a pre-Renaissance Faire or baseball game brunch.

No thank you.  That means enough for Yelpers to get the hint, but not the fine people at Camelback Toyota. I was here with Jenny while we were waiting to pick up her car from the [most recent round of] recall repairs it needed. Of course we had to wait in the customer lounge where the salesmen lurk.   As much as I despise salesmen, I get it. You have to reach out to anyone in the showroom. But not each and everyone of you need to do it. And you don't need to continue to try to force a sales-focused conversation with me when I've clearly stated that I am not interested. It's a waste of your time and it's frustrating as all hell to me. I know you're there if I need anything. I understand if I have questions all I have to do is all. I'm sure this vehicle there is a much better option than my reliable paid off Jeep that I love. But I can decide when I'm ready to contact you.  "Methinks not" may be subtle of a narrative for the one star rating.

For the record, I had to strongly plead with Jenny to give this theater higher than a one star rating. But please, AMC Management, if you want to thank me, do so by sending me a gift certificate to any theater but this one.  $10 per ticket took me back somewhat but the tone of this [arguably] two star experience was the valueless interaction with the employees. After dealing with the uninterested box office girl, the ticket taker was actually inviting and helpful and, silly me, I got my hopes up that my experience at AMC Arizona Center 24 may actually end up being comparable to seeing a movie at a theater that charges a fraction of the cost.  We approached the refreshment stand and, as the ladies assembled our order on the counter, one held up a blacked hot dog (think of the rancid hot dog Kramer eats to avoid making Lloyd Braun think he is crazy) and asked if we wanted it. Considering we were paying $5 for a hot dog at a national chain theater that should have some kind of quality control system in place for refreshments, we declined. The girl simply turned around and handed the bad item to the back and instructed them to throw it away before grabbing a normal looking hot dog for our order. That simple so why even ask us?  Though the lobby was generally empty and pairs of employees were standing around chatting in strategic locations, the condiment area was unkempt including butter-flavored soaked popcorn on the counter. Something that a $7 theater would probably just send someone to wipe down but, somehow, not a priority here.    Also, the restrooms are a dump and don't even have mirrors. Not sure why a more expensive theater would vary from the clean restroom standard for the public park bathroom decor, but I think it's a swing-and-a-miss by AMC's interior design experts.  So why two stars? Well, Yelp doesn't allow zero star reviews (which I agree with, FTR) so everyone gets a freebie. And the in-theater experience was actually good. So, that's how AMC got a two star review for a theater I doubt I will ever again attend or recommend.

Our visit to Sylvia's La Canasta Mexican Restaurant was, in a word, sub-optimal. We'd seen the place for a couple years and never dropped in but decided the beautiful spring weather was our opportunity to try the nearby patio.  Nothing about the visit was a disaster but, as others have mentioned, the service was painfully slow. This meant long periods without water refills, which made the only-adequate food even less impressive. By the end of the visit we just wanted our check and to be on our way -- naturally, this transaction took 10+ minutes.   I don't know if I'll go back. Seeing that my experience seems to be the standard (for some time now), I think I'll keep exploring the valley.

I am just going to hit on the new "Mill Avenue's New Year's Eve" since most of the year, Mill Ave is exactly what you would expect so you should know if this is the kind of atmosphere you want to visit or not.   Because the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable, Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12. Previously, Mill was barricaded off, you had to pay to enter, and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars. At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance.   Now that Tempe has taken over, the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks. Now, while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture, in the case of the Fiesta Bowl, an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals, where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status, they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally. The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year.   Honestly, I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole. It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks. There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual), and all the while, the only "entertainment" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money.    But should you still decide to go next year -- because the city's PR department will tell us that they've made it better than ever -- don't say I didn't warn you.

I'm a ReStore fan. The place has all kinds of good condition item from furniture to lighting to building materials. We landed a bed frame and headboard at 60% off that was a great deal.   The staff is nice but the real key is to not get overwhelmed -- after all, what are you REALLY going to do with that clawfoot tub?

Its a solid five stars. Pull in, grab a night Sonoran Dog, some salsa and guac, and get out. Service is good, food is very decent (not the best Sonoran Dog I've ever had but still very good), and price is right.  When you get a late night hankerin', get on down and get yourself a dog.

After starting to attend haunted houses in 2012, I feel like I'm pretty much a connoisseur of the damned by now. We hit FOS opening night 2014 and it was a blast. I was initially hesitant because of how few days the attraction is open -- only twice a week for a month -- and how reasonable the price was ($16 but you can get a $2 off coupon on their website).  We drove past the parking lot once but, once inside, checked out the pumpkins for sale and petting zoo set up. There were a lot of people congregated at the trampoline/race track and a handful of families entering the fun maze but it was nothing like the never-ending queues that seem to make up certain haunted houses. There is no fast pass option here so plan accordingly -- can't just throw money at a long wait here.  There were about three groups ahead of us when we got to the haunted maze entrance. They stagger your entrance time and, for us, it worked. We never came close to the group ahead of us, keeping the spooks fresh and unexpected. Don't know what their max group size is -- we had 4.   Not going to drop any specifics about the haunt but it was very well done. Going through the corn is a whole other experience from the conventional haunted house. Yes -- it is a single path, not a maze -- but there are so many turns on the path that you are constantly "in the moment" rather than the conventional walk-into-room-get-spooked-walk-out-of-the-room format. All in all, it wasn't the biggest (no fair attractions or food booths) but it was the best haunted house experience I've had in Phoenix.  I'd recommend shoes since I wore flip flops and, though it says no running, you will get some startles that will have you almost pushing Jenny over in hopes of saving yourself (or, at least, I did).

Let me say this, it shouldn't be that hard to mix a drink. Don't get me wrong, I don't go to old town on a Saturday night and expect them to make me a manhattan, but I do expect a lounge type bar to be able to execute anything on it's drink menu. Sidebar completely succeeds there. And with a hip decor, friendly barkeeps, and ample seating Sidebar earns a five star rating (because, though the prices may seem high, you're actually getting that exemplary drink -- take note Applebees/airport bars).

Oh yeah -- this Walmart is the pits. I don't know where to even begin so I'll just be brief -- don't go in here unless your expectations are LOW.

Frank's is great. i'm pretty sure on my first visit the owners served me and it was excellent. Been back multiple times since, trying all the different sandwiches (all made on their excellent bread) and always received excellent service. Think I got out of there yesterday with a pasta salad, sub, cherry coke, and a Rocky Road bar for under $10. Stellar prices.  I'd love to elaborate but there isn't much more to tell. When you're working around the house on a Saturday morning and lunch sneaks up ya, 100% of the time you should go take care of that hunger at Frank's.

It's Sunday morning and we're running a couple errands when Jenny and I realize, 'damn, we're hungry.' We call a couple popular standbys but there is no way a 45 minute wait will do. We call Scramble and are told it is a ten minute wait. We're just a couple blocks away so we're in the parking lot in about five minutes. Considering the line is out the door, down the sidewalk, and into the parking lot, I'm having second thoughts as we stop at the end of a long queue with a lot of people mumbling (more than a few conversations about how many open tables were inside). An insincerely chipper employee at the door calls for the line to form further down the sidewalk "so no one gets run over by a car in the parking lot."  I figure the line must move quickly but, after seeing the line is growing I can only assume that, at best, the wait is ten minutes after you finally get the counter to order. We scope out the situation for a few minutes as the line continues to grow and our position moves forward only about four feet. Clearly ten minutes was a lie. I call another place, find out they have no wait, and we start walking back to our car. As we approach the vehicle, an unprompted farewell is called to us, "Take care! Have a good morning!" Honestly, I didn't know if the chipper employee was being rude or just didn't realize that we'd never actually entered the establishment. Either way, I don't really care. This was just such a disappointing experience that I was just glad to get out.

We've only been to the Lunch Box for breakfast but our experiences have all been good. I like their menudo and Jenny gets any of their breakfast items. For that, it's pretty much a can't-go-wrong affair. The staff is nice and (great on a weekend when everywhere else seems to have a 45 min wait) we've yet to encounter a wait to get a table.

Yes, yes, yes. This is the indian buffet I have been searching for and thank you, find Yelpers, for guiding me here. The food is excellent, the service is good, and the price is right on.   I don't even have a lot to say for this review because, if you're coming across it, you're probably looking for an indian buffet AND you've let your search area cheat outside the Strip. Well look no further. Hit the directions button and get on down to Mount Everest India's Cuisine!

We went to Zipps to watch college football. The Kansas State alumni club was taking up much of the restaurant with the KSU/OU game on the tv's. The service was very good as the waitresses kept up with everone. The food is conventional bar food with a limited beer selection. Prices weren't cheap but given than we camped at the table for three hours, it was fine. Probably a 3 star sports bar experience.  So I rate my Zipps experience 4 stars because of the entertainment value provided by the table next to us. It had about six of the most annoying teenage boys I've seen since my daughter's 8th grade advancement ceremony. Now, granted, I came from a generation where you bent the bill of your baseball cap and hid your smile if you were 15 and rocking braces but I'm no square. I get that teenager boys are constantly trying to figure out the society around them so I cut them slack for dressing like retards, growing too slow, and being annoying - in fact, I even pump up my Zipps Yelp review because no one responded when, for example, the table of virgins cheered when OU scored in an attempt to rile up the KSU alums. And to watch them putting away ranch like it's nobody's business while commenting on who should ask out the waitress (she was probably too hot for me, but why wouldn't Angus have a shot at this 32 year old POA? What with his off-color Red Sox cap and sweatshirt from the Jesse Pinkman season one collection, who could say no?). From watching them systematically remove any traces of vegetables from their Cheapest-Thing-On-The-Menu-Burgers to discussing the merits and shortcomings of the domestic swills (Ham claimed a liking for dark microbrews -- but then failed to make a "just like I like my women" joke) to stumbling through dividing the check with proper tip, the fact that Zipps leaves these wieners alone and treats them like a regular group of awkward grown men will assure their (and my) repeat business as a new generation of ASU-educated 49ers fans are bred right before my eyes.

We hit Hula's on a Friday evening to grab dinner and a drink. The restaurant is just a ways from the light rail so, from a convenience standpoint, this is a plus. We had a couple themed mixed drinks and, like others have said, they don't skimp on the booze. It was raining so the bar area was very crowded but props to the bartender for finding us and providing consistent service.  Not much to be said for the happy hour specials but Hula's isn't about $2 Coronas anyways so plan on having something mixed off the menu.

You know how I know Total and Wine & More is neither helpful (like a small boutique) nor carries an "endless" selection of beverages (like a warehouse store)? Because they run national radio advertisements saying that they are helpful (like a small boutique) and carry an "endless" selection of beverages (like a warehouse store). Visiting TW&M is more like visiting Dimpus Burger in Super Troopers.    I was looking for a specific beer that I had tried and, knowing it may be a tough find in the valley, I hit up TW&M. I was armed with: the name of the beer, the country of origin, and a honest sense of humility. After briefly pursuing the beer selection, I realized I was not going to find this on my own and approached the employee who was scanning a couple shelf items. I said I was looking for a beer and asked if he could help me find it.   "I don't know. Maybe." Thanks for the vote of confidence, Guy Who Should Be Working at Total Mutton Chops & More Mustache Accessories.   I tell him the name and where it is brewed. I expect him to key it up in his little computer and give me an aisle and shelf location. Instead he says, literally, just "No." I guess he knows the entire selection of TW&M by heart. Impressive stuff for a guy just told he didn't know if he'd be able to help me.   He then asks in his in-store communicator if they carry it. The tone was very condescending -- as if I had walked in and asked if they carried Bridgestone Tires or Newport Cigarettes. "Do we have a litre of cola?" would have been more sincere.   It comes back that they do not have it. "Yeah we don't have it." (Quite the limitless selection -- like a warehouse store). He then turns his back to me and returns to his scanning. Doesn't offer to help me find another selection. Doesn't ask if I had tried the beer and wanted to see if we could find something similar (you know, like the small boutique service with the experts TW&M claims to have).   I ended up grabbing another beer that I could find (and I know I could have gotten at my local boutique shop) and, as I walked the through the store, generally noticed that the "impressive selection" of TW&M includes an entire case committed to Miller products and a a vodka aisle that is 60% Stolichnaya and Absolute-flavored vodkas. The whiskey aisle is dominated by a Fireball display and is surrounded by other cinnamon-flavored whisky knock offs. Such wonderful options for the discerning pallet...of an ASU freshman who has somehow ventured into central Phoenix.   So -- no service, underwhelming selection, and nothing special about their prices. Total Wine & More is, as expected, all marketing and no substance.

As others have noted, the hours here seems a bit more arbitrary than posted. Kind of frustrating because -- and I don't know about you -- I pretty much go to soul food when I got a hankering for soul food.   Service is great and I appreciate what they are doing there. Everything is cooked to order and everything I've tried has been spot on. Excellent greens, mac n cheese, chicken, and catfish (of note) but the star is the peach cobbler, in my opinion, while Jenny votes for the sweet potato pie.   I love that they offer Kool-Aid even though the meal is rich enough without adding like a liter of sugar. All in all (and if it's when they are open and cooking) ODH is my soul food restaurant of choice.

Seriously, This Carl's Jr, if I'm writing a review about your franchise fast food establishment then you're doing something drastically wrong. Unfortunately, I can only explain the symptoms not the causes of your problems.   The worst thing about the C'sJ is the driver thru service. As others have mentioned, it's slow. And not like, "oh this place is so busy that I'll have to wait." Rather, it's a "One car ahead of me? Three? Four? It doesn't matter -- I'd better clear out 14 minutes to get my order." I'd twice waited so long at this drive thru that, after the car in front of me pulled out, I just continued past the window.   Well, before Sunday, that is, when I [foolishly] tried to make a 'quick' visit to their drive thru. There was one vehicle pulling away from the speaker when I rolled up. I promptly gave my order, pulled forward, then waited....waited...waited...watched the vehicle receive it's order -- A SINGLE BAG AND TWO DRINKS -- and pull away. I checked my clock, saw that I had spent 14 minutes trapped in their drive thru, and just drove off. Who knew how long they would have needed to actually complete my order -- that could have easily been a 30 minute drive thru trip! I don't what the line of cars now waiting behind me did but I'm sure any guess is accurate.   Does this location not staff? Is the staff not trained? Does the staff not care? Does it not have equipment? Is the equipment not functional? Does the equipment not care?  Honestly, I don't know, but it's pretty amazing that this location -- which I see does a lot of business in a premium location -- hasn't thought it might be worthwhile to operate efficiently. For me, I'll probably just call it quits on Carl's Jr because this one just isn't worth the hassle.   Thanks, This Carl's Jr, now I'm a guy who Yelps about fast food.

El Burrito Grande, which translates to The Large Burrito, has the best Mexican food in the South-of-I-10-&-West-of-the-17 quadrant. The place is tiny and tucked off Buckeye with a very small parking lot. It's hot inside and the decor is pretty much reflective of the industrial area in which is operates. But the food is excellent and the service is friendly. It's funny because, if you head east a few blocks, you'll always see the rush of yuppies coming outside their downtown perimeter to 'go ethnic' for weekday lunches. I've sat in the restaurants and heard countless times, often from a young professional with a pastel dress shirt and a lanyard displaying his laminated ID card, that "I know it doesn't look like much but this place has the best mexican food!"   Except those places don't have the best mexican food, EBG does. It's just that they're another 3 minutes from Pastel Professional's office and he's only got an hour lunch break, not 66 minutes.   Tortas, wet burros, tacos...you name it. Their salsas are great and their grilled vegetables are always on point. I'd make a destination lunch of EBG but, at least, if you are in the area then you should consider stopping by and sampling their menu.

I'm a pretty introverted dude and often at niche-type establishments, I feel like I'm provided second-rate service because my first impression at most places is to be left alone. And since I look like a total square, this has been compounded at some smoke shops I have visited. So, I went in to Just Blaze with a certain level of trepidation. Call me gun shy but I could tell you stories ("Yeah, they're called Yelp reviews, dude.")...  A good size shop with a host of display cases, pipes, clothing, painting on the walls, and vape goods, I had only planned on getting in for e-juice for my brother and getting out. I received a sincere greeting when I entered and was offered immediate service. I asked to browse for a bit first and the employee was accommodating. JB has a good selection of pipes that I was checking out and, when I finally made my way to the juices, I only had to ask and I had immediate service, including helpful (not condescending or off-topic or forced) conversation about the products -- I didn't know, I don't do e-cigs.   I got rang up and made my way out without issue. Big ups to Just Blaze. Cool store, nice people -- I'll be back for sure.

I hit up Zinnias for the first time on one of their Third Thursday sales (20% off everything) and was oh so very impressed. They have all kinds of items -- from housewares to clothing to patio furniture -- and it's priced reasonably enough and without an abundance of customer-expelling clutter. I didn't find anything this trip but I'll definitely be back!

We hit Stingray for a sushi lunch during a gorgeous weather streak and obviously weren't alone as the restaurant was practically empty inside with a ten minute wait for a patio table. Being midday, we elected to sit at the bar on the patio that allowed us to enjoy the weather and view the televisions.  Yes, the pricing here is a little on the high side but the sushi (today and on all my visits) is consistently good and the atmosphere is nice. Also -- and I noticed most reviews didn't touch on this -- they have a nice little sake list that is always fun for sampling (we did the pear one today and it was great). It was slow and bartender took care of us but I will say that the service was good and all of the staff was friendly and polite.  Agree with what one reviewer said about the "trying to be a club" feel. I have been there in the evening and it is a place to be. Guess there isn't a lot that can be done about that though -- just be aware if you are going for a late Friday dinner or something.

Drove in, got our spot, and 'enjoyed' Paranormal Activity 4. Please note, however, my rating is not based on any of the following:  1) The movie we saw 2) The Drive-In Experience (Generally-speaking) 3) The optimal drive-in  Now, the third point makes this difficult because I am not really a drive-in connoisseur. However, given that there are not any other drive-ins within a reasonable distance of WWG9, treat this review as more of a focused audit of one business.   The big pros of this place is that is it big, organized, and a great value. They have a pretty broad selection of movies playing and the one staff member I did deal with, the ticket girl, was friendly and efficient. Also, check out their website. It's good (that's the only word I can think for it).  The nothings of the place are:  That it is far from you -- an item another poster actually complained about like it's going to be cost-effective to put a parking lot (essentially) of that size in downtown Scottsdale. The ghetto-bird is flying around -- I see the thing if I am at the park at night. It doesn't make me knock the rating of the park (the drunk guy rubbing one out and inviting me into the bathroom does). It isn't even distracting.  It is in the Avenues -- I get it. The Avenues are bad. But I saw no security issues and, frankly, if your car gets jacked at a drive-in theater, you are probably doing something wrong.   Now, the con: The screen and sound are a little blurry. Now, I will admit right off that this may have been more of a factor of me watching PA4 than anything about the theater being imperfect. Maybe this is just part of the 'drive inn experience' and I doubt it would have bothered me as much if I had been watching the Expendables 2 or some other film that you don't really focus on much for the details.   All said, especially now when the weather is nice, it's a brilliant move to head out to WWG9 with some In N Out and a couple blankets.

I'm a Phil guy (phildoeshair.com). Have been for years.   Followed him from his old west valley set up to Salon Embellish here on 7th. He does pixels and color and updos and all this crazy stuff; I just appreciate he still has time to get in a regular for a men's haircut.  I really like the new digs at SE. The facility is cool, I always find parking, and the atmosphere is really positive and upbeat. Deborah, the new owner, is great too. Very friendly and doing a great job with the place.   Really just can't say enough good things. A great place if you're nearby and definitely worth the trip if you're not exactly local.

I'm a Super Star fan. It's a drive thru car wash so don't be looking for a top notch detailing but they are efficient. There are three automatic payment entrances which is GREAT because there is always one lady in an SUV sitting there for five minutes trying to decide if she wants tire wax and trying to pay in crumpled up bills.   But once you are through there is always ample vacuums and you can get yourself in and out with minimal hassle. Add on top that the price is right, and let's go!

Look, I got a soft top jeep with a broken zipper for my back window (read: no back window) so conventional car washes are not an option for old _____ (still haven't picked a name for this vehicle). It's gotta be do it yourself, it's gotta be functional, and it's gotta be a place I feel is appropriate to having some Use Your Illusion II blasting while I give ______ a good scrub.   Now, I brought in ______ last night because she was filthy. Since we moved, I had left ______ parked and, without a back window, the inside was just a layer of dust and some cat hair. Down to Spot Free Car Wash I went, Axl in full blast, and pulled into one of their always-available stalls. Six minutes on the exterior and six on the interior and I was back on the road. Total cost -- I dunno, like 4 bucks?   Added benefit, it's right next to the O'Reilly so if you need to grab glass cleaner or tire shine, there you go.

So Jenny's uncles are, as I write this, moving from West Hollywood to the valley. Specifically, the part of the valley right down the street from this Dunkin' Donuts. So we swung by over the weekend on a visit to their place. Now, I'll order hot coffee anytime of the year and, straight up, I had no idea DD's coffee was so good. I mean, I sincerely try to avoid chain coffee as much as possible (Did you know my Starbucks gold lapsed in April? Yeah, it did. #nbd) but DD really impressed. Especially considering it was like 4pm on a 100+ degree day and I very much expected two bucks worth of burnt brown liquid. Instead I got a fresh cup of piping hot joe with just the right amount of cream.   Right on, Dunkin'. Cactus Rd runs on you.

Roger was on point. We purchased a new TV, mount, and sound bar and needed someone to install them in our living room. I called Roger and it was no issue. I explained what we had, the construction of our wall, and our expectations for the installation. It was no problem for Roger and he got us on schedule.   He called when he was on his way to our place and was on time. Jenny was home for the installation and Roger handled it all without issue. I'm sure he's done a hundred of these but, you know, when it's your equipment and your house, you want to know the installation is done right. Well, that was the case with Roger. The final bill was completely reasonable and in line with his quote.   We are pleased with Roger and he will surely be our first call for any other home theater needs. Highly recommended from us.

I spent about 20 minutes in Furniture Market, checking out their various offerings with Jenny and discussing our interests. I feel comfortable telling you about Furniture Market. I'm pretty sure FM couldn't tell you a thing about me because we were all but invisible to the staff. I guess even expecting a simple greeting is out of order from the three employees who were 'busy' have a casual discussion, leaning against the counter and taking in the showroom sights during our visit.   One and done.

We had a nice long debate about whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars (from an account that has given 5 stars to pho places in the avenues). In the end, it came down to how well the restaurant met EXPECTATIONS.  If you have been to Tucson, for example. a very comparable restaurant is Hub. Similar atmospheres and rich, hearty, flavorful foods. But that place is in crappy Tucson so, pretty much having some edison bulbs down there scores you a 5 star review on the 'hip vibe' alone. But Arrogant Butcher is in downtown Phoenix and has nearly 300 reviews around 4 stars. One should EXPECT more than the typical Fox template.   The decor and service is excellent as expected.  However, the letdown came when, after enjoying the hummus plate and pretzel fondue, the angus cheeseburger came to the table. Good but so far below expectations. With all the other great items on the menu, they should have just axed the forgettable burger plate (or improve it to Zinburger status).   Also, be aware that they stop taking reservations 48 hours in advance. So, though our wait on a Saturday night was only about 15 minutes, you may want to plan ahead.

Windsor has become my staple place to take people when I need a "good place" off the top of my head. The food is good, the ambiance is great, and the service is dependable. It's got credibility with all the cool kids ("Oh I've heard of that place!") and the drink menu (and execution) is always a great conversation starter.

I have to second Phillip Ring at Phil Does Hair (suite 109 & phildoeshair.com). He's awesome. I'm a total square of a guy and have always been a challenge for hair stylists. Not Phil - from day 1 I've given very little direction, he's asked the necessary clarification questions, and the results have been fantastic. He really knows his techniques and abilities (he's constantly honing his craft) and, as a client, the best thing you can do is be up front with him. The more freedom he has to do your hair with the techniques he is most confident, the better you will look. Plus he's a "cool dude."  Book him on the Vagaro app or through his website info. You won't be sorry.

I didn't attend haunted houses until last year and that was only because Jenny loves Halloween. If my only other option is be terrorized by a month that should be just happy to mark the annual welcome of the pumpkin spice latte, then I'm happy to see Christmas displays up with end of summer clearance sales. So should my vote count for less? Absolutely. But does it? No. This is America and, if you haven't noticed, the loudest minority wins. So sit back as I make 500 review profiles and shut down my least favorite venues (looking at Upper Crust Pizza in Tucson).  As for 13th Floor, we went on a Friday evening fairly early (8-8:30pm) and it was plenty busy. The typical middle school crowd and older guys who like to walk through extra slow and casually just to prove to their wives that they "ain't 'fraid no kid who jump out of the dark and can't touch me because I'll hit 'em like I hit the kids, Lerlane!" Who the hell wants to go to a haunted house and be that boring, I don't know. Who wants to bang them -- I just have no idea but assume low self esteem is in order.  When asked about which pass we wanted, the girl told us the general admission wait was about an hour and forty-five minutes. And she said this very casually. The scary (get it?) thing is that the queue was only about a fifth of the way full! Maybe it's because I'm one of those lucky "single and childless" people my friends hate on Facebook, but if I'm spending $50 for a haunted house, I'll drop an extra $20 to cut the wait by an hour and a half. I don't know how quickly the VIP passes got in but I'd have to guess less than five minutes. Our wait ended up being about ten or fifteen minutes, which we spent watching the characters who meander through the crowd, mostly hitting on the ladies with the guys who were too cool for haunted houses but wouldn't dip into their beer money to not have to stand around a bunch of fifteen year olds. Funny how such behavior draws the actor's attention.  They gave us the standard "you don't touch them, they don't touch you" brief and we were on our way. The props and effects were good and there were a few startles. As others have mentioned, there isn't much crowd control so we started off with seven and ended up with about three groups together mostly because our group was lead by -- go ahead and guess -- some dude who wanted to walk through with his hands in his pockets browsing at all the props as if it were Walk As Slow As Possible And Hold Up Everyone Day at the Bad Driver Museum. Again, bro, why bother getting off the couch?  I'm not going to share any specifics but Jenny gives a compelling argument for the four stars. Just know that it is warm inside and that neither the lines nor the attraction is short.

This place makes for premo sports fields. I've played rugby and soccer here and am always impressed by the facilities. Best in the valley - the grass is regularly maintained and the fields are cared for. For example. They actually section off where the goalies play to keep this from becoming a huge dead spot.   Just great. Wish there were more facilities like this one around Phoenix.

Yes people -- FREE COOKIE for checking in on Yelp. You don't have to dine in. Don't have to buy a combo. Don't have to toss in a business card. Just check in and get your cookie.  That said, Jenny loves Jersey Mikes and introduced me via this location. This one has been our J Mikes for a couple years now and I have only good things to say about it (considering it is, you know, a fast food sandwich joint). Good staff, clean store, don't skimp on the sub-making, and always ample parking.

Reading through the reviews, I could see how Wy Knot reviews run the gamut from five star to one. Our experience was spectacular - great food, good service, comfortable atmosphere - but the staff does seem to be operating by the seat of their pants and I could see how service may slip under busier conditions. For our Saturday morning brunch, however, they nailed it and I hope to be back again to try their French toast.

A little about me: I moved to Phoenix from Tucson about three years ago and, while I'll never defend anything about Tucson beyond college basketball (if they'd just move the home games to US Airways Center, it would be perfect), one item of "culture shock" I've had with Phoenix is that so many establishments are in strip mall shopping centers. It's not a criticism and I understand why it makes sense to have a bar/club with metal bands playing share a wall with a dry cleaning business or Kindercare facility -- but I still just find it interesting.   I bring this up because COF is in the anchor store location of a Surprise/Sun City shopping center so it was funny to pull in and see the entrance actors meandering among the shopping center vehicles and I immediately wondered if they ever get crossed up with the general public just trying to pick up their dry cleaning or grab a taco. Maybe -- but it's all in good fun. And being in a shopping center didn't take away anything because, once you are inside, it's all haunted house business.  I won't give anything away but the haunt itself was impressive. As others have mentioned, it's three parts and the first is definitely the "strongest" in the sense of a conventional haunted house attraction -- but I thought the other sets were still enjoyable, even if they weren't as scary. I may sound like an old biddy, but it's nice to see some really cool props and sets in addition to the actors popping out at you.   Across the board, the props and sets were impressive (some really cool uses of lights and character interaction), the actors did a good job and, most of all, weren't obnoxious/screaming in your ear/lame. I'd say some of the best actors were the ones who didn't say anything because that's just eerie sometimes.   In short -- it's a haunted house. So let down your guard enough to give this attraction the opportunity to scare you and I expect you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Twirl is a great little place. Situated between the Campbell and Central/Camelback light rail stops, there is also adequate private lot parking. Inside there is usually up to about 12 frozen yogurt machines with a variety of flavors. One of the highlights -- they label them gluten-free, fat-free, or no sugar added. Topping selection is on par and the seating area is nice, if not that huge. Definitely worth a stop.

We saw Vovomeena was listed as the best breakfast in the neighborhood by the New Times so figured we'd give it a Sunday morning go. What a great place! It's hidden behind the Five Guys in that center so we'd never even seen it before. We were fortunate that it was not as busy as some other Yelpers have experienced and,showing up during a lull, the coffee bar guy even came over and discussed the menu with us.   Great service, great food, love the atmosphere and coffee. And all just an easy bike ride down 5th Ave. Sinfully delicious but a worthwhile breakfast bookmark.

Pretty standard cheap pizza and wings fare. Can get a large 1-topping and wings for less than $20, quite a deal. As others have said, not much seating so carry out is a good option. Service is friendly too.

Modern on Melrose is one of our favorite shops on La Curva. It is on the pricey side (of an already pricey shopping experience) but I've had great success for two reasons:  First, the service has been excellent and friendly. We're new to the mcm scene and didn't get snubbed at for not being "in the know" -- sadly, this was a welcome relief.   Second, the selection is good. Yeah, it's always a hunt, but at MOM you aren't going to be sifting through, basically, garbage to find your treasures. With most of the weeding done for you, the store is a much nicer visit.

Federal Pizza is my favorite Upward Project. Cool and casual, with bike parking and comfortable Central Ave patio seating, the food and drinks are always excellent and the service is great.   I highly recommend the Casanova with dates and ricotta cheese. Coupled with their wonderful crust -- it takes like heaven.   Just be aware that it gets busy, especially on the evenings with their pizza+drinks specials.

Apart from Wells Fargo, as a heinous corporate entity manipulating the economic system to their gains at the expense of the public and private interests of America, this WF has a nice staff. It does get busy at times (in kind of a bank desert, for the most part) but their staff always seems to do the best and treat customers with respect and show a smile.   So, for their local employees, I wish them all the best of luck in careers outside of WF - they have what it takes. Beyond them, anything I wrote about what WF truly deserves would get me put on a Domestic Terrorist Watch List and, worse, possibly cost me my Elite status.

I can't give any Too Big To Fail Institution more than two stars and, frankly, that's plenty generous. This is just a branch in a bad Fry's. Nothing to see here anyways.

What can you really not like about QT (except the clientele usually)? They're efficient, clean, and have a big coffee and fountain soda selection.   I try not to ask too much of my gas stations because, hey, they've actually come a long way over the years. But I need to dock QT a star because THEY present themselves as more than a grab n go. That it is objectively a good choice for a healthy quick lunch. No no -- these are all high calorie, preserved, sandwiches. Yeah, it's no microwave burrito, but don't try to sell me on the health benefits of eating at your gas station.

We had four parties convening on Mill Ave last Saturday for the Territorial Cup basketball game and, not wanting too much of a hassle, we agreed on the ol' "first ones to find a good set up texts everyone else and we'll meet there." Jenny and I were the first to arrive and, after vetoing a couple chain establishments, found a table on the patio at CASA Sunba.   Our server was excellent, discussing the draft and mixed drink selections with us, and taking care of our party as members trickled in. I enjoyed a couple beers and our friends had the street tacos, which they said were very good. The patio was the perfect place to people watch on a gorgeous game day.    Plus the patio is dog-friendly which, as a dog lover, is a huge plus to me.

Max kudos to Matteo's for keeping it real. It's probably my favorite place to ride to on a Saturday morning. While you wait you can explore the nearby farmers market but, if your thing is sitting, they extended their outside waiting area. Once inside, I always score the special. Coffee is good too.   To be frank, Matt does everything they do right. From food to service to ambiance -- Matt's always reliable.

We've specifically hit up Otro Cafe for breakfast/brunch on a few occasions simply because the wait was non-existent versus 40+ minutes elsewhere (even when we were driving to Otro, the line at Denny's was out the door! -- Come on, people!). Each time our visit has been a success. The chiliquiles are one of their more popular breakfast items and definitely worth a try, for my two cents.   Also big ups to the service at Otro. They're always on the ball and right on time with everything from drink orders, to refills, to clearing the table. All in all, I just highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good breakfast experience but don't require the place to be on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives -- because Otro seems to be a little too good for that nonsense.

I take it all back. This place regularly messes up orders (in addition to being slow and ghetto). Screw this Fili's.

Great little Thai restaurant and I hope it survives the light rail construction. Most everything about the place is on par with expectations -- the menu, the service, the food, the decor -- but it is all done well. If you're thinking, "hey, I'm in the mood for thai food." Then Thai Lotus is for you.

We were pleasantly surprised by Snooze. So many breakfast places in the Valley are, for lack of a better work, underwhelming. I don't need a lumberjack slam or an eight page menu of just breakfast offerings. Just do what you do and do it well - and that describes our experiences at Snooze. Excellent service, good coffee (BIG CUPS - if you are reading this, Snooze, we always have to ask for extra creamer for our two coffees), and good food. The interior is cool and comfortable. I'm glad we tried the place and, if you are considering giving Snooze a go, I think you will too.

I don't go here as often as I could (already had an attachment to another nearby coffee shop before The Refuge Cafe opened) but TRC is a 5 star all the way. It's clean, spacious, and comfortable (with televisions, tables, and chair seating). They serve beer and wine (not sure about mixed drinks) in addition to their coffee and food menu. It's a great place to, at the very least, try.

We live just down the street from Joe's and knew nothing of the old location when we finally saw work being done to the old chinese buffet building. And then one morning it was just open and the place was packed with cars! It seems Joe's has some very loyal regulars. Happy to have a breakfast place within walking distance as the weather has gotten nice, we've been to Joe's a handful of times. Service has always been good, the food has always been decent, and the cars are always lined up every weekend. Welcome to the neighborhood, Joe's!

My first visit to this Starbucks and I liked it. A community table in addition to many 2-person tables and patio seating (too hot/humid to enjoy in August). Another successful by-the-book Starbucks.

I was like you once. Looking on yelp for the best indian food option. Knowing that these places on the strip weren't worth their prices but wondering what other joints still offer good food, good service, and nice atmosphere (because, hey, you're vacationing in Vegas and you don't need to be slumming it at some filthy ethnic place to save $10 you'll just lose on a side bet anyways). Well, this is the answer. Do not look at any other reviews because New Dehli is where you want to go.  Just a few months old, it has a slew of positive reviews and -- as great as the food was (there is a mango lassi free with your check in that you MUST get) -- the pride the staff/owners put into the restaurant is apparent with every detail of the restaurant. From the decor to the menu to the EXCELLENT service, New Dehli is what comes to mind (for me, at least) when we talk about "shopping local". This is their restaurant and I saw in my visit that the owners truly care about this place. These folks took out a space in a shopping center (plenty of parking!) and have created a truly sincere dining experience. Maybe it's not something I can explain well -- but if you'd like to understand, swing by New Dehli on a Thursday evening and take in the experience. Never have a rooted this hard for a restaurant in a city I've only been visiting.

Cocina Oaxaqueña is a hidden gem in the strip mall just northeast of the intersection of 19th and Bethany. Since moving to the area, it was essential that we find a new local mexican food joint. C-Oax had been on my radar for some time before I finally stopped in. As most mexican joints are sonoran, it's always a nice change of pace to visit a restaurant that does things differently. Here, mole, black beans, and a delicious salsa verde headline my visits. The restaurant is clean and the service is always excellent. I'm thrilled to have Cocina Oaxaqueña as a neighborhood mexican dining option.

Jenny and I hit up RAEO because we recently moved to the area so we just MUST try the local food joints. I typically prefer to cheat east, not west, of our place but when you're talking about good mexican food in a little hole in the wall next to a tobacco shop in a we buy gold shopping center, you're going to have to give up on location (doubt they are planning to expand into Kierland or anything). I do wish they were open later but, as I pointed out about the location, I can't fault them for their hours.  Anyways, the food is good and the service is legit. We haven't decided yet if it will be our new "bring out of town visitors here for the good mexican food that is near our place" mostly because of the ambience. It's great for me, fine for Jenny when she's really in the mood for good mexican, but you know how visitors get. Maybe we'll take our most casual friends -- definitely not a place to meet the parents for the first time.   Recommend the hot dogs and you can't go wrong with any of the tacos. Fish tacos here are better than most places but their carne asada is great for those of you who like to play it safe with a classic order.

We got some Silver Dragon takeout on a Sunday night after a long weekend. Their full menu is online and phone ordering was a breeze. When we arrived, we found the dining room filled with tables of -- how do I state this in a PC manner -- families who looked like they REALLY knew a thing or two about good chinese food. So I took it as a good sign.  We ordered the spicy string beans, egg rolls, house fried rice, and some shrimp thing. Everything was good. It was simple, of course, but they do what they do and they do it well.  It's reasonably priced which, compared to our last go-to chinese place, Diamonds, was a bit of a price increase. But the service was prompt and the food was good. I'll leave this bookmark on my list.

"My life changed after Just One of the Guys. People stopped looking at my face and looked at my chest instead." - Joyce Hyser  Now I see what all the fuss is about! Thanks Lindsey and Film Bar for giving me a second chance to appreciate the humor, highlights, and styles that I just didn't pick up on when I was two and this Made In Arizona(tm) insta-classic hit the theaters. Plus a drink --- BRAVO!  Such a fun event and, as a new Elite, a good chance to visit with the other attendees. Really looking forward to the next one.

This was my first Elite event so, first and foremost, thanks to Lindsey and the Yelpers in the group for the fun time. I didn't think I'd be able to eat a bite after Erik's workout at Orange Theory (and the surprise jump squats & planks to which I didn't see the first group exposed) but Flower Child was the perfect complement to the workout and it was with enthusiasm that I inhaled a grain plate with sautéed spinach, chicken, sweet potatoes, and  roasted vegetables. And any reservations I had about looking like a pig in front of my fellow Elites went out the window when the lemon cake arrived. So I understand if you all decide to kick me out but, frankly, the food at Flower Child would be worth it.    Now two days after the event, I'm unable to twist (thanks medicine ball crunches) and pretty much can't eat or hit the gym without realizing how sub-optimal my routines have been - which is a great takeaway from an afternoon of good efforts and good eating.   Oh! And I got a wristband souvenir! Awesome!

I wish I was more into the food scene because the illustrious Dan (of so many other reviews) was in the kitchen the evening we visited and I could have been all hot shot with Jenny and been like, "oh yeah, that's Dan back there." But I'm not so that's that.   Now the food at Mucho Macho Taco is good. We had 50/50 tacos and brisket tacos that were both on par. The red salsa was decent but the green salsa ('verde' as it is often known) was creamy and excellent flavored. The star of the show, however, was the chicken quesadilla. Not too greasy and full of cheese -- dip that baby in that salsa and stuff your face.   Glad we finally tried MMT -- will definitely be back to try out more of the menu.

So fun. SO FUN!  Thanks MixMasterMark and the Hendrick's crew for putting on a great event. If the DPCA comes to your city, out of town Yelpers, I recommend you attend. Mark's a great presenter, the food is delicious, and the drinks are wonderful -- and how much fun to craft them by your own hands.   Special thanks to The Gladly for hosting this one in their beautiful venue.

Abyssinia has great ethiopian food. The restaurant itself is small and intimate (in a size way, not a romantic way) and the service is excellent. Make sure you get the tea when you go -- their's is excellent.   Every time we go, we get the sampler 'platter' and every dish is spiced and flavorful. They definitely take pride in their menu here. I highly recommend Abyssinia if you like Ethiopian food or are considering trying it.

I didn't know anything about Tunisian food entering Habbouz but I left knowing that I like from this place. Seriously - go to the restaurant. The service is wonderful and, for my fellow Localists, it's a mom and pop operation where the Mrs makes the meals fresh right there on site. This is the kind of restaurant, in this Yelper's humble opinion, that should get community support.  We had the hummus, grilled chicken (I don't recall the menu name), and slata mechouiya. It was all so good. I regret that we only visited to snack because I would have loved to try even more of their menu -- though I definitely will in the future. The chicken was crisp on the outside and so juicy inside. We ended up taking some of the baked goods home as well. One was a little pistachio treat - unlike anything I'd had -- and some baklava, which was flaky and doughy.   Really, I just can't say enough good things. It's right off I-17 with plenty of parking. Bookmark it and hit it up. You'll agree with me.

This Pita Jungle is on par with the other locations. Being in a large parking lot is nice and the new construction took consideration to have a larger entry/waiting area, which is nice. It's the same menu and selection as the other locations and, dine-in or take-out, it's as consistent as the others.
