I'm going to make this short. 1. This is not your typical chinese restaurant. 2. They serve Sichuan styled food, and their american menu indeed sucks. 3. If you like sichuan styled food, this is a great place to go. Unfortunately it is not the best for anything else but they offer what they have very well (if you know what to expect).

I just came over here and the influence of Yelp easily made me try it out as I do pass by here quite a bit.  I was so surprised by the exterior that I wasn't sure of it'd be that great of a place.  Originally looking at it, it didn't even look like a sit-down from the exterior, boy, I was surprised.  This place is great, I loved every part of it, from the bread to my takoyaki appetizer and my ramen.  The people caught on really quickly that I drink a lot of water and kept the water coming which is very difficult in my opinion.  It's weird but one of the major points for me that I care about.  The food and the service was fantastic, the wait was a little longer than I thought it should be but it made up for it.  Also the place is disguised on the exterior in my opinoin and I would've taken longer to come here without the reviews here.   I'd give it 4.5 if I could because of the wait on the food but I hope it's better next time.  I will definitely be returning here again.  ---------------------- I just took the full star off.  Should be 3.5 stars now.  The last 3 times I've been here, it's too much waiting.  It took 40 minutes to get my food the last time.  I think something needs to be done about the wait time and why doesn't the waiter ask me how I'm doing or bring me water?  I appreciate those kinds of things!

This restaurant really should not exist. The waiter has made a ton of mistakes and the food takes forever to come out.

I haven't had chinese food in a while and don't know why I would bother coming up this far north to get it.  I got the lunch special which is way more expensive than other places and the food was 'meh'.  For Chinese food I would go anywhere else.    They lose 3 stars for mediocre food and high price tag to go along with it.  i do have to say, they have very nice service and the fortune cookies were surprisingly fresh.

I love Dim Sum! I have been to this place tons of times for the past 20+ years? It's hard to find a good Dim Sum place around the valley and I just went again today at 11am and it took 20 minutes to get a table.  The wait is because the food is good and mostly affordable as you order and they mark items on the little pink sheet that keeps track of the price of what you've ordered.  Since it's Dim Sum, and I don't have a lot of places to base it on, the place is busy and you need to let the people walking by know what you want which is unlike other places.  I don't know of a better dim sum place in the valley, I'd recommend coming here!

Unfortunately my years at ASU were spent at the building dedicated purely to the Computer Scientists/Computer Systems Engineer majors.  Probably the majority of creepy guys were in this major so they tried to keep them away from the main campus as much as possible by putting us half a mile away from all the other people.  However, I did meet my current g/f here(ASU in general, not the creepy guy building), there are tons of interesting classes such as ballroom/swing/latin dance courses and lots of studying to keep you busy (or parties if you're not into studying).  I'm glad I took the chance to find classes that I enjoyed such as music history, dance classes, and basketball to go along with all of my engineering classes.  5 stars because I enjoyed my 4 years here and I'm glad it wasn't any longer than that!

This place looks awful Food is greasy and makes me feel heavy.  So why the decent rating? the food you do get tastes awesome. Price did go up this year, and the portion is variable.  Star taken off since some days I order and my bowl is full and sometimes it's 3/5ths full.  I often get pick-up so all the food gets mushed up together and it's very clear when portions are not the same.  I love the food and will be returning.

not a perfect place to go, but I like what I order. First things first... I always pronounce "Chuhgajib" wrong.  The way I pronounce it, it sounds like 'brothel house' in Korean, it's suppose to mean the wife-side parent's place I believe.  (Please let me know if I am wrong)  My girl is Korean and loves going to this place and I've grown to love it!  I personally love the stone bowl that the bi bim bap comes out in.  Keeps the food hot though if you don't mix it... the rice gets hard on the bottom.  It isn't obvious if you don't eat it often.  the other thing I usually get is the T12 (or whichever it is with the BBQ pork and choice of tofu soup).  I love the BBQ pork, it can't be found in many other Korean places and it's unlike anywhere else that has it... so warning to anyone else who has had it and change your expectations now! The Tofu Soup I get is always the seafood and extra spicy, I like it that way... wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice.  Unfortunately, the food is not cooked consistently... I can tell when the older lady cooks the food or someone else does.  She's clearly the better cook and I didn't give this place a 5 star because of the chance where I don't get her and the food is disappointing.  Last of all, the price is great, it's a well priced Korean place (especially lunch or happy hour) and my favorite Korean in the valley because I can afford to go back.

I came here recently to try to remember my dancing experiences at ASU.  They offer a great deal to start out with, for $25 you get 3 20 minute private lessons and 2 group lessons.  I signed up for 4 more classes however, at a much much higher rate. I highly recommend the starting deal as I feel I've gotten much out of that but overall price, I can't really afford many more classes!

More like "not-worthy" piano moving. Owner is grumpy, bad service. Failed to deliver piano on scheduled date.

I tried this place last night and I'm in-between a 3 and a 4.  I think I may try this place again but I went over here last night as a craving.  I used to live in Chandler area and that pick up stix was always good to me and this one doesn't quite do it but I think I'll give it a 2nd chance later.  I got my food to-go and I was pretty happy with how fast I got my food.  It was a little shy of 5 minutes which seems okay to me.  Last night, they had a special of .25 per cheese wonton.  So I went ahead and got some of those.  Typical for dinner, the portions were a good size for one person.  In the end, I like that there are plenty of vegetables and nuts in my kung pao chicken but the spicy orange something chicken?  That was just meat and in a smaller container.   Bottom line, I wanted brown rice and some chinese food and I got exactly what I wanted last night and it tasted good and nearby to me.

Starting off, this is downstairs in the Memorial Union of ASU.  Okay, so if there is one reason to give this place the perfect 5 stars, it is the price.  at $3/hr for billiards and $1.50/game + $1/pair of shoes, it's hard to beat the price anywhere else.  The arcades (where I may have spent the most of my time of college) was always cheaper than everywhere else too.  Though, the games that are not played at all sometimes takes a long time to get fixed.  Not all the pool tables are the best, but you can ask for the one that you want so if you play enough pool or you've been here enough, you know which tables have the higher quality felt.  Also they use high quality chalk, I've never seen better anywhere else.  The bowling alley is also a great place to be at, this place has the coolest neon shoes.  You could always go with the regular not-so-colorful shoes, but it is not nearly as fun.  The alley isn't always oiled but it's due to having only one person maintaining their lanes.  Still, it's a cheap place to go to and a great way to build up your skill for very little cost or just to have a big group without overwhelming your wallet.  So, even though this is in the main building that college students hang out at, you can still get in and the employees will typically charge you the ASU student price.    Great price, fun, only negative may be the employee's sometimes poor choice of music and takes cash only.

I have gained a lot of weight over time and I realized it is time to start to bring it back down some.  So I looked up yoga (was interested in something that wouldn't agitate my patella femoral syndrome) and this is the closest one to me (and I trusted yelpers!).  This studio seems to be exactly what I needed.  I have been experimenting with at-home workouts but I just couldn't get myself to stay on them for very long at a time to make it worth it.  I started a week ($20) and was tired and sore and I kept coming back to "get my money's worth" and by the end of the week, I was actually thinking, my sinus feels a little better, I'm going to keep going to see how I feel.  I also enjoyed the teacher calling my name out to tell me I'm doing something wrong (I enjoy it more when they tell me "it's good" though) and feel like it's the attention I need to improve myself.  I am now 2 and a half weeks and am actively trying to average 5 days/week (13 classes out of 17 days so far).  I am completely amazed with how my body has changed so far.  I am way more flexible than I have been in a long time.  I don't see any other big changes yet but I go just for that fraction of a bit better each time I go back to class and feel happy about it.  Do note, Bikram Yoga is hot and humid and I seem to always question myself in the middle why I keep coming back.   Personally, when I am out though, I am glad I went (except for that one time I ate a combo meal at Chino Bandido's [Jade red in a Quesadilla is awesome!] before hand).

great affordable fast food.   Not a lot of places make tofu nuggets and theirs are the best I've had. I typically will get a chicken bowl as well and maybe crab puffs.  If I'm looking for affordable and fast Japanese food, I can't recommend this place enough.

I used to come here when they first opened and love the place but maybe I've changed because this place just doesn't fit me any more.  My last beans did seem to have any brisket in it the last time I came and that was my favorite thing here (always doubled up beans as my side).  I guess it's time for me to move on and I found another bbq place for me now.  I guess I have a new taste now.  Sorry, it's not you it's me.

I haven't been making yelp reviews for a while but after going to this place, I just couldn't stop myself.  I went here 3 times in one week, I tried out the savory crepes, the sweet crepes, their teas and I just enjoyed it all. The Nutella crepe with strawberry + banana was awesome and so was the honey banana almonds.  I will probably end up trying everything on their crepe menu though.  If you are waiting for a movie or need somewhere to hang out afterwards or any other excuse you can think of... come here, I enjoyed the service, the atmosphere and their food.

I just came back from Culvers and it was a delicious experience (for fast food). I went through the drive-through since it was clear the inside was packed. The only problem I had was I asked for what was directly on the menu and labeled as  'limited edition' and was told they don't have it. "smoky cheddar bacon & mushroom butterburger"  So they asked if I would take a  "smoky cheddar butterburger".   I said sure thinking "what a new guy..." (note this place just opened today)  I quickly opened the wrapper to see what I got (it was now a mystery) To my excitement I got exactly what I wanted (bacon and mushroom and all!)  Food was great (if you like culvers and I do).  Drive through guy drove me slightly nuts, but I hope they improve it.

I Looooooooove chipotle.  But Unfortunately I miss the one I used to go to which is too far away for me now since I used to live in chandler/ahwatukee area.  It's a little cold in here or maybe it's just me.  I wasn't fond of the cashier and there weren't many on the smiling side.  However, the food still tasted great.  I love rice and I always get a burrito bowl with extra rice (they only charge you if you ask for extra meat).  So I used to get a burrito that they could not completely close because I asked for extra on too many things.  However that makes a mess on me so I get the bowl instead and this place is great for filling up on good tasting food on the cheap.  If I went there and there were happier people, I would boost the rating, I just felt like the cashier was peering through my soul... not what I want when I want food.  I prefer going to a place with a positive atmosphere.  Edit: went back and people were much better this time :)  from 3 stars to 4 now.

This place has fantastic BBQ!  OK, I came here a few months ago and was holding the reviews for a bit secretly hiding this awesome place but it really should be mentioned.  I ordered the shredded beef brisket and put on the ghost pepper sauce and could not believe how good the food was. I got beans on my side and I wasn't too impressed, but it didn't ruin the moment for me at all as I came in wanting good meat and got it.  The staff was funny, our group had some goofy banter and just really enjoyed being there.  I'm so coming back! I went to other BBQ places and this place has ruined it for me so this is now the only place on my list for BBQ.

I've dropped my car off on Monday and was told I would get my estimate on Wednesday. It's now Thursday and I don't know the status of it yet.  They should communicate if something isn't going to be done on time.  update: Got the status on 1/14, took 9 days for an estimate :(
