Very quick and helpful. The gal who usually makes my smoothies is kind and knows her stuff! They also have almond milk upon request :) Other items (besides smoothies) a little lover priced but I will only come here if I need a great after workout protein shake!!

I have been going to Salon Tru for about 4 years now and have loved every experience I have had. Emily is my go to gal and is VERY good at what she does. She took my box dyed almost black hair back to blonde slowly and safely!! I am a natural blonde and have kept it that way since. Every appointment I let her pick my highlight colors and she always does an amazing job! She does what is best for the health of your hair while keeping your wants in mind :) The rest of the staff is also helpful and prompt!! Did I mention they offer you wine??

Rick is the Man!! I will never buy another gym membership again!! I started working out here with my trainer Patrick (AMAZING) but everyone has been very helpful and care about not only your fitness goals but personal goals as well. They quickly learn your name and treat you like family!! I also love how everyone who works out there is focused on one thing... WORKING OUT... No guys flexing and taking pics in this gym! I HIGHLY recommend working out with Patrick and becoming a member at Maximum Fitness if you want the best gym for your money!

I am in love with this place!! The instructors are upbeat and play fun music! It may be the hottest hour or so of my life but I feel like a million buck when I leave! I found this place on groupon but certainly see myself becoming a long time member after :)

Been coming here on and off for several years!! They are always busy... This is a good thing because they're good at what they do but in my last experience they didn't provide me with adequate service because it seemed like they wanted me out of the door and on to the next person. My Gel manicure was rushed and for $30 it only last a week. However, the pedicures are amazing!! I don't get designs so no worry about that but the massage was great and worth the price.

I will NEVER get a spray tan elsewhere!! Phoenix Glow is the place to go!!  Ann is professional, funny and an all around great person! She makes you feel comfortable during the seemingly awkward experience. I trust Ann with all of my spray tans including my tan for my ASU graduation, when I competed at Miss Arizona USA and also for my birthday and new years! The tan is always what I expect and I know it will come out looking flawless!!  Save your time, don't look anywhere else!!

I am a HUGE hot yoga fan... I used to live real close to this place so i purchased the groupon and took the months worth of classes. Afterward I enjoyed going so much my boyfriend called and tried purchasing me another pass... I was moving in a few months out of state so he tried getting me a 3 month pass... They told him they would only allow a 6 month pass (ok?) so he asked If he purchase a 6 month pass can 3 months go to me and 3 months to my friend so that we can go together? They assured him it was perfectly fine!! So he purchased a 6 month hot yoga membership (as we know these are not cheap) I was so excited to arrive at yoginis with my friend and they told me she was not allowed to use half my pass and I would have to use it. I assured them I was moving in 3 months and that the other 3 months would go to waste which is why he asked about my friend in the first place which was said to be ok... Needless to say they didn't budge on letting my friend use it with me, called my BF a liar, and i lost out on 3 months of prepaid (NOT CHEAP) yoga because they also would not refund the money! If it wasn't prepaid I wouldn't have gone back. This place is comfortable and clean but not accommodating.

Michelle was awesome! My friends and I went to Vegas during the weekend of the fight for a bachelorette party. As im sure you could assume it was the busiest weekend. BUT - she managed to get us into XS to see David Guetta. My friends and I had two comp drinks each. It was amazing and the bride was happy. Also she gave me another great contact who hooked us up at Omnia the next night. I will always use Michelle for any Vegas needs.

Today was my first day at Sumits North Phoenix and I was very pleased with my experience! Their practice is very similar to past studios I've been to! The instructor was friendly and helpful and the gal at the front desk was very welcoming! I left feeling refreshed (sweaty) and relaxed!! I am certainly looking forward to more HOT Yoga :)
