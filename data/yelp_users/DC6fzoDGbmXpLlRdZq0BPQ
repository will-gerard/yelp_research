With its drab exterior and tinted windows, it's only natural to think that YC's is closed. But this is a dining experience you don't want to miss. Once inside, you are met with a charming, buffet-styled line of meats/fish, veggies, and sauce followed immediately by two large grills where your food is cooked in front of you. Portion sizes are as big or small as you make them, but YC's encourages "packing" your bowl to maximize value.  If you're a YC's virgin, feel free to follow one of the sauce recipes written in chalk above the grilling area. They are well-proportioned and achieve the intended style. But make no mistake: improvising with various combinations and proportions on your own is what YC's is all about. You are not here to order food; you are here to design it.   If you are visiting the East Valley and want a unique, hands-on dining experience, YC's Mongolian Grill is a fun and challenging option. It does one thing, and it does it well! Two minor complaints: there is no option to buy a small bowl during dinner hours; and, take-out bags cost an additional $0.50.

With a pool table and TV screens on every wall, the Regal Beagle is one part sports bar, two parts dive bar. Even overlooking the awkward seating arrangement, though, I was not particularly impressed.   The limes we were brought were desiccated and repulsive... aaaand the server was on autopilot the whole time we were there. But if drink specials on game day are what you're looking for, this is the bar for you!
