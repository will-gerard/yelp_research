I had to spend all day thinking of the words to write in this review. I still can't... I came to Exclusive Collision Center for an estimate because it was closer than the first place I went to... I was shocked when the estimate was LESS THAN HALF what the other place gave me... I was suspicious, and worried that I wasn't paying enough. But I picked up my car today and it looks fantastic. Exclusive Collision Center is a family run operation, but they made me feel like part of the family too. They saw how stressed I was, and did so much to help make it a painless process. They went so far above and beyond with their performance and customer service that I can confidently say I will never have to look for another Collision Center!!!

It's important to note that this review is more about IKEA as a company, and not just this single ikea store.  I'm the type of person that when I hear someone else complain about a company or service, I am like "Geez, what's their problem." But if that person feels the same way I feel right now about my experience with IKEA, I guess I should be more sympathetic.  I was pre-conditioned to believe that IKEA was an amazing store from the way a lot of my friends feel about it, and with their unique products and competitive pricing. But because of previous personal experiences with someone who was obsessed with IKEA, I wanted to avoiding buying their product for my new apartment. After my uncle bought me a gift-card for their store, though, I decided it would be rude not to use it.  Well after the experience I had today, my determination to stay away from their store is stronger than ever.  I'm sad to say that the gift card was lost in the mail, which isn't my uncles fault or even IKEAs fault. But their handling of the situation was so far below acceptable standards, that I feel compelled to tell my story. I want to just note that it takes a lot for a company to piss me off, and I am so nice to deal with that conflicts usually don't arise.  3 hours of my life was wiped out today at the IKEA store in Tempe as I tried to recover the missing gift card. I got the run-around that we all have experienced at least once in our lives. But the problem was that each time I was put on hold, the wait time was between 20 and 30 minutes. I spent about 2 hours on the phone and very little of that time was talking to a person. When I was talking to an actual human, the time was only spent being told how I CANNOT be helped.  IKEA is not going to suffer losing one customer, but the way they treated this one customer is an enormous disgrace to their brand. I know if I had a company, I would want everyone that worked for me to find ways to say yes, and fix a problem. Instead, everyone today found ways to say no, did not offer up a solution, and then passed me along. Unfortunately everyone lost today. Ikea lost a customer and I lost a great place to find furniture because after my experience today, I cannot in good conscience give that company money, and have their brand in my home.  Like I said, the gift card was lost in the mail. Ikea told my uncle they would contact him when they got the card back in the mail. Then they told him to go to a store. Since the closest store is 500 miles away, they told him to tell me to go to my store. Once at the store, I was told I would have to call the support line. I spent so long on hold that my phone died, and I asked to speak to the manager. The manager said there was nothing he could do, in a very rude way, then stared at me blankly as I struggled to ask what I was supposed to do. He basically told me to "find help somewhere else". After another hour on the phone (mostly on hold), IKEA did the only thing "possible" and refunded the money to my uncles credit card. Unfortunately the poor service already did it's damage.  Ikea is a great store, with many cheap, useful, and fun products. But sadly due to personal negative associations, and the horrible service today, Ikea will be one of only 2 companies that I boycott. Maybe after time passes I will change my mind, but today it's set in stone.

SMART has been great. They sent a guy over, Barron, who was friendly, intelligent, and very helpful! I've never had a time where the people at Smart haven't been quick and knowledgable when answering a question or request. HIGHLY recommended.
