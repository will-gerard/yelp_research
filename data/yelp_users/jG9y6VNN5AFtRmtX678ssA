This is my first review as a Yelper. Hope it helps!   These guys here at Discount Tire are amazing. Haven't gone anywhere else because I am perfectly happy here. They rotated my tires, aired them up, and performed check-ups for free. They answer all your questions and help you figure out any problems that you may have.   THEY ARE ALL FRIENDLY AND SAY HI WITH A SMILE. I seriously appreciate that, you don't get what seems like genuine people these days. The guys here are either really good actors, or they're all genuine and love helping their customers. Again, I appreciate that.  I just acquired my first car, a used 2008 Honda Civic back in 2012, and I didn't really know how to take care of my tires. Not much of a car person. They educated me and gave me guidelines to follow. They let me know when I should start considering new tires when the tire tread gets to a certain point, etc.   Their prices and sales for tires here are insane. They really do follow their name, I can't really find any other places that have better prices than these guys.  So anyway, come here for your tire needs. These guys are the best, hands down.

I love Boston Market. The food is warm and it hits the spot when you want a good dinner. It's not fine food of course, but you know what, I'm a simple man. It's good.  The reason for my one star review, was because of their service. I just got back from a trip, so I figured I'd take 5 minutes to write about it real quick while it's fresh in my head and I'm eating their food.  I ordered online to take it out. It's a late night here at work, and this Boston Market is just down the street from the office, so I got me and the team some dinner. It said it would be ready at 7:18 pm when I was checking out my order online on the website, so about 20 minutes. Nothing too hard, 20 minutes is fine. Cool.  When I arrive there, I tell them I'm picking up my order. Everyone up front and in the kitchen looked like they were in training. All in their young 20's, maybe late teens. All seemed to be struggling to organize the couple of orders they had. 3 people were there, counting me. 3-4 people were on the line making the dinner plates. The cashier printed out my receipt, makes a mistake, asks for my receipt back, and etc.  Then he says, "Okay, we'll get this made for you right now."  ...Huh? So I ordered online for nothing or something?  I waited about another 15-20 minutes. Order was finally ready. I take it back to the office five minutes away. I eat the first bite, the vegetables and meat were sort of cold. Like room temperature at best.  I don't blame the kids up there working. They were doing their best, they weren't joking around, they just seem overwhelmed and learning. I blame the manager for putting them all up there. Horrible decision. Horrible service. And to end it all, when I got back and handed out dinner to everyone, I realized I forgot drinks. I admit, that was probably all my fault though. They said "You're good to go" when my order was finally ready, and I just took it and left.   I paid for those drinks but you know what? I didn't care anymore. Too frustrated.

This was my first time here and I loved it. It's hidden away with no sign out front because everyone already knows about this place. If you want to be a pretentious Macbook Pro hipster to write your next novel, come here. If you want to chill out with friends and talk, come here. The atmosphere is dim and chill at night and they have inside and outside seating that's always bustling. Parking can be hard sometimes because this place is so good.  I had an order of hot chocolate and it was creamy and delicious. The barista drew a beautiful leaf design in the cream on top; if they day is slow, they'll take their time to show off their talents with detailed art that makes me not even want to drink it because I'll ruin it. I love details like that.   Their mac 'n cheese dish is made and baked perfectly and everything is served in big coffee cups that make you feel at home. The music they play there is very different and not Top 40 which is something I always appreciate. The experience is delightful and I would recommend this place for sure!

I've been here a couple times. I love their fries, and I love their milkshakes the most. Of course the burgers are solid. They also do sushi and I still need to try that! The atmosphere at night is beautiful and low key. Great date night place for sure!  The best part is they're open until 2am! My friends and I were looking for some late night quality food and where else better than Delux :)

I worked for Chadwick as a filmmaker/video editor for Modern Wedding Scenes. He's an amazing person, he cares, and he's always focused on what's next and what we can all do better. Most importantly, he's fun and has fun while doing it. He's very talented and know what he's doing when it comes to wedding photography and filmmaking. If you're looking for the best photographer in the valley, and you wanna have some fun while making great photographic art, hire Chadwick. Simple. He goes above and beyond to make sure you're happy, because like I said, he cares.

The donuts are top notch, would go all the time if donuts were in my diet haha!   I'm a bit critical on customer service though when it comes to places so maybe you'll five star it, but I four star it because they could be a little friendlier at times. Some drive thru experiences have been bland where they don't even let me know the total at the end so I'm not sure whether to drive forward or wait, and then they give me a tone "pull up to the window" after sitting there.  But that's just being picky the donuts here are, again, the bomb. Glazed are always the way to go, or my favorite is chocolate icing with sprinkles.

Shut up and take my money! When I first walked up to this place, I fell in love. The menu out on the front door and the signs and everything are all in 8-bit pixels and it's all Super Mario themed. I love it. The idea of this place is genius in my opinion.   The inside walls and ceiling are painted green and blue and such, the lamps are Piranha Plant themed from Super Mario, they also painted up the circular air conditioning vents poking out of the ceiling to look like Warp Pipes with Piranha Plants sticking out of them. They have classic figures of Power Rangers and Mario and Pac-Man, etc. Geek culture heaven. I believe I even saw some rarities. Most importantly, each table has it's own mini flat screen with a console hooked up. They have Sega, SNES, Xbox 360, Wii, and a Ms. Pac Man arcade machine. AWESOME.  My friend just got a job here so I checked it out, that's the only way I heard about it. Turns out it's fairly new, opened up earlier this year, and it's family-run so I find that respectable. I give them 4 stars to hold my excitement back because they are a start-up and definitely have room for improvement as they grow. The place isn't the best-looking of them all, the facilities could look a little better at least, especially on the way to the bathroom. Some of the controllers stick, like the Gamecube controllers to the Wii with Super Smash Bros. Brawl (but it's still Smash Bros. so I got over it). You can tell these controllers and consoles were probably bought cheaply and hooked up real quick. The wires are taped to the wall in an effort to organize it nicely. Again, they're a new start-up, and I'm just being picky.  The pizza/wings were good, I liked it. Nothing popped out at me. They don't have a soda fountain for drinks, but cans stored in a slide-door fridge, just to give you an idea of the quality of the place. But hey canned soda doesn't have to be a bad thing. The best part is that wait time flies by since you're playing video games at your table. It's the best.  Regardless of any negativity I might have inflicted upon you, I seriously quickly forgot about it all as I lost myself in classic titles, especially getting lost with my friends in Smash Bros. Brawl and whipping them, while eating wings. Good times! It was slow at the time as well, so even the cashier came over and played with us for a little. Hah!  P.S. I actually hear they're moving as well to Tempe (expanding?) so looks like the sky's the limit for this place. Big potential, bright future for sure.
