C&W's is one of my favorite places for lunch downtown.  I've been coming here for years.  The portions are huge and the staff is great.  The only thing I miss are the huge, comfy booths, but I realize they had to take them out to accommodate more diners.  Order the Lobster Bisque; it's incredible!

I forgot how much I liked Zoe's.  I used to come here all the time but just stopped for some reason.... now I'll put it back on to the "usual" list for sure.  The "Grüben" grilled turkey sandwich on rye is super delicious, and I can't get enough of the feta coleslaw, though the pasta salad w/ basil is really tasty too.  I noticed they've added braised white beans as a side option which is intriguing; can't wait to try them!  The service is always ridiculously fast; which is a plus for a 'fast/casual' type place.   The chocolate sheet cake is super yummy and reminds me of the cakes my grandma used to make.  You always get bonus points for reminding me of my grandmother. :)

I can't believe I haven't reviewed Best of Philly yet... I've been coming here for ten years now and the food is always consistent, tasty and cheap.  Yes, the cheesesteaks are delicious, but you HAVE to try their gyros. AMAZING. Just remember your number if you call in for takeout...they don't take your name. Bombsteak!

Hands down my favorite BBQ sauce.  Dreamy.   I always order the pulled pork or chicken sandwich and halfway through I ditch the bread to get closer to the delicious meat and sauce.  :)  Also, this is my go-to for catering office events.  They're super professional and I always get glowing reviews from my customers.

Really fun place to go on your lunch break.  They have plenty of dining options (some better than others), great stuff in the Ranch Market, and beautiful grounds with a koi pond and replicas of Chinese sculptures.

As Paul Krendler said to Dr. Hannibal Lecter while drinking drugged broth before Lecter fed him bites of his own brain, "It's not very good, Buddy."  Everything we tried tasted kind of old; like it had been sitting out too long.  The fried rice was seriously the best part of the meal.    My meal (Shanghai Style Meatballs, meh) arrived a good 10 minutes after my husband's Kung Pao Chicken.  Lame.    We had high hopes for the appetizer, as the menu listed both "steamed dumplings" and "pot stickers" on the menu....still on the lookout for a good Shanghai style dumpling we gave them a shot.  They arrived well after the main courses and were nearly inedible.  Alas, the hunt for Xiaolongbao continues....I found some frozen options in the Ranch Market next door and I'm hoping for the best!    The staff here was very friendly, but with the so-so food and clunky service I doubt we'll be back.

I have dreams about the mozzarella on the Caprese style sandwich.  Seriously.   And the Soppressata is the PERFECT compliment...if you're coming as a twosome order both and share.  YUM.

I started coming to Urban Hair two years ago at the recommendation of my best friend and I haven't been to anyone but Ethan since!  Aside from being the hippest salon in Phoenix the entire staff goes out of their way to accommodate and make you feel comfortable. Ethan is amazing - he has an amazing ability to visualize your best look and then make it happen.  I swear he's a freaking magician! I get compliments on my hair ALL the time - this NEVER used to happen when I was going to an overpriced salon in Scottsdale where I was paying twice the price. I'm a total die-hard - I won't go anywhere else unless Ethan leaves me for reality television.  Love.

Oh Trader Joe's, you make me feel like a better person than I actually am.  Thanks for the big organic selection.  Thanks for making those chopped salads and hummus flavors in the refrigerated section taste so damn good.  And for carrying delicious swiss dark chocolate with 30% whole hazelnuts.  And for carrying weird crap like Mochi and real cornichons and tangerine juice.   You're the best.  :)

The interior of Wong's is pretty gross....when I'm waiting for my to-go order I usually count the number of giant cobwebs in the corner and try to guess their length in feet.  'Cuz they're HUGE.    I don't care though, because their food is freaking amazing.  You HAVE to order the pan fried pot stickers - they're the best in town.  They have really good soups and cheap lunch specials as well.   Also the exterior paint color seems to change every time I go, which makes me laugh.  Work it, Wong's.

I really, really like Ranch Market.  It takes me a minute to get past the ghetto parking lot and blaring tejano music, but once I do I'm rewarded with an ultra-fresh (and enormous) produce department, an expansive meat and seafood department and a captivating deli which includes tons of salsas and a fresh tortilla factory. I disagree with other reviewers who have said the staff doesn't speak English. Everyone I've dealt with is bilingual. Prices are really reasonable as well!

Meh x 1000.  Outdated building.  Sub-par produce.  Marginally acceptable selection at meat & deli counters.  Seafood selection tolerable at best.  Teeming with drunken Lake People on weekends.  Frequented by creepy "Hills Have Eyes" people at all times.    Employees are awesome and it's close to my house.  If it weren't for those factors I wouldn't return.  Extra points for NOT being Wal-Mart.

Gas prices are inordinately high here, either due to lake proximity or being the last station on the way out of town. This area is in desperate need of more options. If you're a gas station tycoon I suggest building across the street!

There's a reason this place has been around so long. They have lots of offbeat options like mayonnaise shrimp, cucumber soup and a couple of interesting and legitimately spicy curries. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the hot and sour soup; good flavor, but way too viscous for me. The House Rice Noodles are a must!

If I could award 10 stars I would.  Companies like Thunderbird Pools make me realize service like this extremely rare.  To say this is as "good as it gets" is truly an understatement.    Before signing with Thunderbird, my husband and I spoke with Dolphin, Shasta, Presidential and Paddock.  Within 15 minutes of meeting Cohl (the owner) we were sold - I work in new construction sales so I know when someone's phoning it in, but Cohl was so honest, knowledgeable and thorough that I knew immediately Thunderbird was the right choice.  He came by the house, took measurements, and actually designed a 3D mockup on the spot, incorporating features we hadn't even considered.  I know most pool builders use similar software these days but other companies took up to a week to get back to us and their designs looked boring and outdated compared to what Cohl came up with.  He listened to our concerns, wants and needs and ultimately designed a beautiful pool that went above and beyond our wishes while still meeting our budget.    I think the thing I appreciated the most was Cohl's willingness to let us know if he thought some of our choices would present problems rather than just let us decide without input and possibly wind up unhappy....for instance, we initially had our hearts set on a certain PebbleSheen color but Cohl mentioned that he thought it may be too dark for our tastes....after looking over samples and extensive online research we realized he was right.  Ultimately, we wound up selecting a custom color Cohl designed with the PebbleSheen people because he wasn't 100% satisfied with their standard options - and it looks AMAZING. Also telling:  Our next door neighbors are in the process of planning a pool and have an incredibly detailed and fantastic architect's design; they met with other companies and apparently Thunderbird was the only company who pointed out possible (and serious) structural issues - now THAT'S service.   The level of attention was incredible; the time quote was spot on (we were swimming exactly 33 days after the first dig day), we received weekly updates, up-front and completely honest feedback, and any questions were answered within minutes.  We felt incredibly comfortable throughout the entire process and will recommend Thunderbird Pools to anyone without hesitation.  They've been around for a long time and truly care about their customers.  Our pool is everything we wanted and more, and looks even better than we imagined.    Cohl and Lisa made an intimidating process easy, fun and budget-friendly - who could ask for more?  Thank you both!  :)

I wish I could award no stars. I hate the fact that this is my "hometown airline".  Terrible reward program. Horrible customer service.  Grossly outdated and uncomfortable aircraft, especially on overseas flights. I've switched my allegiances to United...what does it matter anyway when I have to connect through Charlotte or Philly 90% of the time despite living in their hub city?  I'm no huge Southwest fan, but I'll take them any day over Airways. At least I'll save the overinflated checked-baggage fee. There's a reason no large carrier will partner with this fleabag joke of an airline.

YES, this place has been around forever, though it isn't that great so I'm not sure why.  There are plenty of other cheap (and better) options in the area.  I used to come here for takeout quite a bit a few years back and remember it being better; not sure what happened.  I went today and it was definitely below average.    The House Fried Rice is really the only thing I've ever eaten here that was legitimately good.  Everything else is utility.

The parking situation here sucks; if you can't find anything on the street (you won't) you'll have to park in the garage across the street.  Good luck with that if you don't own a Vespa or a Smart car.    The interior is always crowded and you'll be lucky to find a table during the lunch rush.  That said, I don't care because the Traffic Jam sandwich is to DIE for.  Meat overload w/ delicious hot peppers - so, so good!   Yeah, the crusty bread may "Cap'n Crunch" the top of your mouth a little bit but it's totally worth it.   They had another location in North Phoenix closer to my house and sadly, it seems to have closed.  I may or may not have shed an actual tear.

I've lived in Phoenix for 16 years and just visited the Phoenix Art Museum for the first time last week.  What a huge mistake (my haste, not the museum)!  This place is amazing; beautiful building, gorgeous grounds and massive in size.  The modern/contemporary section was my favorite by a mile, with a collection easily on par with other museums I've been to worldwide.  I can't wait to go back and see what I missed! A+++

The other reviewers are dead-on when they say you need a few hours to do it up right at the Brass Armadillo.  I kind of wish I would have thought of something in particular to look for before heading in; i.e. Tiffany style lamps, watches, etc.  But nonetheless, it was a blast looking at all of the displays.  Prices ran the gamut from really reasonable to really outrageous.  I saw a vintage 100% cashmere car coat with a faux fur collar in impeccable shape for around $30 (easily could have sold on eBay for twice that amount or more), but also a pair of fairly beat-up cowboy boots for over $150.00.   Some of the items we saw were downright mind-boggling and definitely not antiques.  Lastly,-If you're scared of creepy old dolls stay the eff away; they're lurking around every corner!

HOW have I not been here before???  This place is amazing.  The cozy little location makes you feel like you're out in the middle of the countryside, even though in reality you're steps from Mill Ave. Everyone - from the bartender to the host to the server - went way out of their way to make sure our meal went well.  I had the quiche special (chorizo & goat cheese) with a side of the soup of the day (califlower with basil) and both were out of this world.  Add in some stellar $6 by-the-glass wine specials and you've got a happy, happy camper.  I will definitely be back! One tip - I didn't realize they had a private parking lot behind the restaurant; so initially I parked on the street at a pay meter.  Save yourself the $0.50 and park back in the alley!  :)

I'm pretty sure Tonto Bar & Grill is my favorite place to eat in AZ.  We've been coming here for special occasion dinners for close to 10 years and I've never been disappointed.  If the weather's nice, definitely get a seat on the patio - amazing views with occasional javelina sightings!  I always order the schnitzel and it's AMAZING - though the burgers, pastas and salads are incredible as well.

Dr. Tracy Marvelle & Dr. Smoky Marvelle are absolutely, hands-down the best vets in town.  They're both super caring and never rush through appointments.  It's clear that they both absolutely love animals and love what they do.  We've been coming here for years, even when we were living in South Phoenix.  They're THAT good. Every one of the staff members is wonderful - including Toby the cat! :)

Fresh, local ingredients, a Chef who cares more about his craft than arguably anyone in town and a great location - that's a recipe for fame, Kids. We should consider ourselves lucky to have such a gem in our city.   Not to mention, the Rosa is hands-down, without question the BEST pizza I've ever had in my life.    Worried about the wait?  Go buy a frozen Totino's, whiners!  ;)

Great option for lodging in Las Vegas - I booked a room for four nights in January 2011 and averaged $65/night - can't beat that!  The rate also included 2-for-1 coupons at the breakfast buffet.  I wasn't expecting much but it definitely didn't disappoint!   The MGM has a monorail stop if that's what you're in to but it's way cheaper and more convenient to take a cab.  Considering how many rooms they have, check-in/check-out was efficient and quick.  My only complaint is that this place is almost overwhelmingly enormous - it takes forever to get anywhere.

We ate here twice this past weekend with a group of friends, once for dinner/happy hour and once for breakfast.  First off - the happy hour menu is unbelievably cheap; $3 specialty cocktails/wine/sparkling wine.  I think between the lot of us we tried every drink on the specialty menu.  My favorites were the Bramble, with gin, lemon & blackberry, and the Ho-Hattan with bourbon, vermouth & bitters.  YUM.  We had a divine grilled cheese sandwich w/ tomato soup for only $5, and the cheese plate was also great.  For breakfast I had the ZuZu breakfast casserole which was topped with the most perfectly poached egg I've ever had.  The level of attention to detail in the food here is incredible - they think of everything.   My only complaint is that a few of the servers were a bit snooty and not very attentive.  We went stretches of approximately 20 minutes without anyone stopping by.  But we think we figured out the problem....there was a female manager working when we first sat down who was SUPER bitchy.....an hour or so later she appeared to have ended her shift and suddenly EVERY server was super cheerful and awesome....hmmm.  We had a server at breakfast who was one of the best I've ever had; wish I would have gotten her name.  EDIT*** I just realized I forgot to mention my FAVORITE part!!!  You HAVE to order a side of grits for breakfast.  They're unreal.  I've never been a big grits fan because of texture issues but these were amazing.  Apparently mascarpone is involved....off I go to attempt a recreation!  :)

Here are my steps to successfully navigating IKEA:    1.  Go on a weekday.  2.  Eat the meatballs first, before you start shopping.  You don't want low blood sugar in this maze.  You should probably order a dessert too, who are you kidding?  3.  Preemptively grab a big yellow bag.  You're gonna want one for impulse purchases.  4.  Vigorously shake and abuse the floor model of whatever it is you're considering purchasing.  Anything that feels like a mess in the store will be worse in your home.  Don't buy.  5.  Stop by nearby Total Wine for supplies before attempting to assemble anything you may have purchased.  Trust me, you'll want liquid reinforcements.

The mid-century modern decor is totally fun, the food/drinks are amazing, service is excellent, and the room was comfy and large with a huge patio.   I wish I would have known about the rooftop patio before we came - we'll definitely return!

Short version: This place is a shithole. Don't bother. Long version: From the moment we walked into the rental office to the day we moved out, this place was a stain.  My husband and I chose Talus as temporary living quarters based on proximity while awaiting the completion of our new home.  In retrospect, it was an impetuous and ill-informed decision.  I suppose our short-term status blinded us, but if you're on the lookout for long-term housing be warned. We had issues with: *  Parking spaces -  We were told it would be two weeks before one was available.  Fine, except in reality there wasn't one available for the better part of TWO MONTHS.  *  Structure - It was so fucking loud in that place that we never once slept through the night while we lived here.  Never.  I know apartments have a reputation for paper-thin walls, but trust me, this isn't the first "multi-family" housing situation I've lived in, and the light fixtures literally swayed from the tenants above simply walking around.  I'm not exaggerating.  I won't even get in to the frequent toddler wrestling matches that took place above us.   *  Staff - outside of the initial contract negotiations, nobody here gives a tin shit about the tenants.  Our infrequent complaints were always met with a scowl and were typically pawned off onto another party, if addressed at all. No complaint or conflict was ever sufficiently handled.   *  Grounds - every conceivable surface was covered in dog shit. Constantly.  The pool was consistently green and littered with cigarette butts and spent beer cans. *  Bugs -  Out of control. I've lived in Phoenix for nearly 20 years and have never experienced this many scorpions, ants or crickets.  I'll echo Chrysty C.'s previous complaint that charging for "monthly" pest control ought to negate any pest sightings.  It didn't.  We found several scorpions and countless crickets. We also spent many a night vacuuming ants from our bathroom and bedroom floors.  While the pests mainly infested the interior, the worst area was the water heater closet on the patio - the crickets were so numerous that we began referring to the closet as the "Temple of Doom".  Foul.   It's difficult to pinpoint which aspect was the worst.  Pure suffering for three months. I feel it's important to point out that it's been two years since we lived here (June - September, 2008).  Maybe the situation has improved since we left.  Somehow I doubt it.   Regardless, I'm still upset about our time here, and I thought my fellow Yelpers should know.   Caveat emptor!

Armando's is SO good... way better than any of the other drive through options in the area.  They have out-of-this-world breakfast burritos (I usually get the Armando's Special; eggs, potatoes, bacon, cheese)...and they're HUGE.  I usually eat half in the morning and half later for a snack.   For lunch; don't pass up the carne asada tacos; delicious.   Everything is really well priced, too - pass up the chains and give Armando's a shot.  It's well worth it!

Comme Ci, Comme Ça.  I left with painted fingers and toes, so I suppose I got what I came for.  The staff was friendly enough in-house but my mother-in-law got some attitude on the phone when she made reservations.   They do have low prices, but one word of caution; they upcharge for EVERYTHING.  Want callus removal?  $5.  Sugar scrub?  $5.  I sprung for the callus removal, which wasn't worth the extra money... I left with rough heels.  :( They also failed to relay this info to my mother-in-law this while we were having our toes done; she only found out AFTER she had the sugar scrub.    My toes looked okay but my fingers left a lot to be desired; I had a splotchy paint job and the technician got a little too friendly with the cuticle trimmers; digging into the skin around my nails to the point of pain and a tiny bit of bleeding.   I suppose in a pinch I may go back for a pedi if I don't feel like springing for a full-on "spa pedicure", but it will probably be a good, long while.   There is another (unrelated) Princess Nails further East on Carefree Highway in the Walgreen's complex which seems to have much nicer reviews; next time I'll try them or Spazzi across the street.

OMG.  So good.  Seriously authentic italian food housed in what looks to be a former Circle K.  Sneaky!   I'll echo the Pasta Giovanni praise, but the real star here is the pizza!  Easily the best pizza in North Phoenix.  The wait staff are complete pros - not an ounce of ennui or arrogance.    As a result, this place fills up quickly in the evenings. Go early or be prepared to wait in the akward entryway or at the bar.

This place is cute and clean, and I really appreciate that they offer Deborah Lippman polishes in addition to the standard issue O.P.I. options.  However, the service left a LOT to be desired.  I came in with a group of five other girls and we had booked pedicures in advance.  Two of the girls (including me) decided on the spot to switch to manicures, which were oddly more expensive.  We even double-checked with the front desk girl to make sure this was acceptable.  The attitude we got from the nail techs was unreal - audible sighs, eye-rolls, etc. It was really just appalling.  Furthermore, my mani has visible flaws.  Lame.

Great place.  I've had the buffet lunch here three times now and have never been disappointed.  The naan is delicious, all of the lamb dishes are incredible, and the veggie curries are top-notch.  Everything is always fresh.   The staff could be a bit more attentive, but for $8.50 a head, who could possibly complain?  Having never dined in India I can't comment on the "authenticity", but I have eaten at several Indian buffets in the Phoenix area and this is most certainly one of the best.  Nice modern atmosphere too!

Same wonderful food as the old school South Phoenix location I know and love, but the attempted recreation of the quirky atmosphere misses the mark.  We felt like the servers were a bit less attentive than at the original as well.    Bottom line:  Order something off of the "House Specialties" section of the menu or the Special board, specifically anything with Adovada ribs (I just tried a special of soft tacos yesterday....YUM).  If you order a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito, you're going to get a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito.  Los Dos gets extra points for serving yummy beans too....I'm not a fan of refried beans because of the weird texture; these are left whole with some sauce and have tons of flavor.  And that green salsa?  I'd drink it with every meal if I could.  Awesome, awesome!

HOLY CRAP THEY HAVE FROZEN XIAOLONGBAO.  :)  These delicious little bites of porky, soupy dumpling heaven have eluded me since I first tasted them in Shanghai - my husband and I have been on the lookout for XLB in Phoenix ever since.  While the search for a restaraunt that serves them continues; we can at least satisfy our cravings with the frozen options from Ranch Market.  I made these from scratch one day and they're a pain in the ass.  Seriously, manna from heaven folks....

I love BevMo for the vast selection, but I don't go here unless I'm specifically looking for something they don't carry in the grocery stores because I typically find Albertson's/Safeway/Fry's prices to be cheaper, at least for common wines.    The staff here is awesome and I love wandering through the aisles looking for weird stuff I've never seen before, but if you're in need of a case of Stella and a bottle of Toasted Head, the grocery store will do just fine!

I LOVE Noble Beast! If you have a dog who eviscerates normal toys, check out the deer antlers...they last forever, don't make a mess and are only taken when naturally shed so they're cruelty free.  They also have tons of natural and organic food options and super cool collars and leashes. Phoenix needs more places like this.

The Shops at Norterra are getting better by the day!  They're anchored by Best Buy & Harkins and are home to several dining options (Smashburger, Sauce, Pita Jungle, PF Chang's, Paradise Bakery) which definitely make Norterra destination-worthy.    They're a bit lacking in the apparel department however. While the smaller clothing boutiques are nice, they can be a bit pricey; I'd love to see a more extensive store like The Gap or Banana Republic.  That said - I'm super glad that not EVERYTHING here is a chain store.    Be sure not to miss Olive Creations or Elevate Coffee Company.

This place just sucks.  We've given them three opportunities and something has gone wrong every single time.  I appreciate the salsas and the interesting drink selection, but it doesn't make up for bland food and weird service.  The last server we had was so rude and off-putting that we got up and left.  I've NEVER done that before.  Oh well - at least El Encanto Dos is close by.

I'm completely impressed by The Mission and I can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.    My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best I've ever had.  We usually don't order desserts and I'm glad we did, because I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was.    My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since I'm pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their "Sophia Loren" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and I'll certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)    Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!

I agree with all of the other reviewers - this place is top-notch!  Everyone here is CLEARLY an animal lover and our little pound puppies were very well taken care of.  They even have a web cam so you can spy on your kids during the day!  ;) We'll DEFINITELY be back!

I love this Safeway.  Definitely one of the better ones.  The peanut butter station is awesome; my favorite is the honey roasted.    The cheese selection is crazy huge and they typically have a guy offering samples on the weekends.   Best grocery in the immediate area!

I'm done.  For years I've put up with Danny's crap because I get a wash with an oil change:  no more.  I can't handle their upsells or lack of professionalism any longer.  Danny's has screwed up so many things over the years I feel like an idiot for going back.  They've botched windshield repairs (it wasn't properly sealed and had to be re-done), left the oil cap off on my engine after an oil change (requiring a degreasing during which they subsequently broke the hydraulic hood prop which held the hood up once opened), dinged my car and consistently done a terrible job on the wash (I left today with bugs all over the front bumper). The kicker came today when I asked them to change the air filter.  I was watching as the tech took the dirty filter right back to my car and started to reinstall it....another tech happened to look up and see me supervising and quickly ran over to get a new filter.  Infuriating.  I'll be going to Fletchers from now on.

I LOVE Poor Little Rich Girl!  The staff is super friendly and they have a wonderful (and always different!) selection of clothes, jeans, shoes, bags & sunglasses, with plenty of deals on luxury goods to be found (a pair of Louboutins for around $130.00, Coach purse for $42.00, Chanel sunglasses for $98.00). They'll give you 40% of the sales price in credit for consignment items, or 30% in cash.   Definitely 'friend' them on Facebook - they're always posting their latest treasures, which guarantees you'll be able to jump on an item as soon as it arrives!

Awesome little hidden gem just South of Downtown!  My husband and I come here sometimes during lunch breaks to feed the ducks and look at the turtles other wildlife.  As with most public parks, you'll spot a vagrant now and again, but the lush setting trumps the occasional weirdo.  :)

Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu.   As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!

My husband and I brought one of our dogs here over the Christmas holiday while our regular vet was closed. She had a weird eye infection and we didn't feel comfortable putting it off for two days. We were admitted right away and the Doctor was in quickly. He was very gentle and thorough, and we were both genuinely satisfied with our experience. I was expecting sticker shock but the bill was in line with standard vet prices.  I would recommend this place to anyone in the unfortunate event they would need it.

My husband and I LOVE Mediterranean food and there are so few options on the far north side of town, so we were anxious to try Olive Tree once it opened.  The space is great; light, bright & inviting.  We ordered a gyro platter, a side of hummus and one of the vegetarian combo platters at the counter, chose a seat and were served quickly.  The hummus was flavorful, but we felt it was a little thick - luckily there were several types of oil set out near the drink machine for use at our discretion - including various olive oils and even avocado oil.  We drizzled the hummus with a bit of the regular olive oil and fell in love.  The falafel were wonderful; packed full of flavor, moist and piping-hot.  Hands-down the best item we ordered was the gyro platter.  So, so, so good.  Gyros are the first thing I try at any new Mediterranean joint and I use it as the litmus test for everything else.  These gyros are my new favorites!  We chose fries for a side and were NOT disappointed; these were delicious.  Our only real complaint was the pita which came with the hummus; it was run-of-the-mill; straight out of the bag, stiff and bland.  Weird, since the pita which came with the gyro platter was warm, pliable, well-seasoned and delicious!!    The proprietors are super friendly, and the grocery has lots of fun goods to take home.  We picked up a few jars of pickled items and tried two types of the baklava as suggested by Justin V. - LOVED it....great suggestion; don't leave without it!

I'm upgrading Olive Tree to 5 stars.  This place just rules it.   Tony and Juliet are super friendly and extremely talented cooks.  I want them to live at my house and cook all my meals.  The shawarma, hummus, tabbouleh, gyros, falafel, foul, soup, kifta....everything is incredible.    They have this spicy sauce called "Shatta" (lol) for sale in the market section. I think it's just red peppers & olive oil, but it's pretty much my new favorite thing.

I'm a fan as well - both for take-out and delivery.  It's not the BEST pizza in the world, but it's light-years ahead of the national chains.  Pizza aside, I would highly suggest trying the Napolitano Pasta - it's incredibly good!   I agree w/ Lisa N., the salads are HUGE easy to split.   The delivery drivers at this location are top-notch - always arriving well ahead of the estimate.

Pretty pretty good.  :) I went with a standard burger, and we ordered one order of regular fries and one order of the sweet potato fries.  Easily the best sweet potato fries I've had in a LONG time.  They're seasoned with rosemary and garlic and they're freaking DELICIOUS.   One small snag when I found a hair on my burger (eww) but the staff went WAY above and beyond in rectifying the situation.  Not only did they give us a coupon for a free burger (you have to pay in advance at the counter so this was easier than removing it from the check), they remade the fries so we wouldn't have to eat cold fries while waiting for the new burger.  At least four employees stopped by the table to make sure we were happy with the solution.    I'll definitely be back!

Should you ever find yourself in need of a vintage french military jacket, a deviled egg platter, a pair of PF Flyers and a quick spar in the boxing ring, all with a side of delicious meatball sliders and a gimlet, The Duce has you covered.   Love it.  Love that it's close to work.  My new fave! :)

TOPPINGS!!    So many delicious toppings. They have gummy hamburgers.  That's gross, but it makes me laugh every time I see them.  I've had better yogurt at other self-serve places but this is still yummy and close to my house.

Latilla SHOULD be a destination.  Its remote location at the Boulders resort means most diners are retired tourists, but Phoenicians would be wise to make the trek.  With its impeccable service, stunning surroundings and creative menu, Latilla deserves a spot on the "must-try" list for anyone in the area.    Each plate is a work of art for the eyes as well as the palate.  A modern Mediterranean menu is diverse enough to keep picky foodies happy while still satisfying less-adventurous diners.  A thorough wine list with plenty of reasonably priced Arizona options sets Latilla apart from other resort restaurants.    There are lots of surprises here; including a truly interesting bread basket featuring terrific flat bread, a sumptuous duck appetizer and a to-die-for hazelnut chocolate cake laced with lavender.    Footnote: The restrooms are impeccably clean and smell AMAZING.  I can't remember the last time a visit to a resort washroom was this memorable!

First off, I'm only awarding two stars because the food was a good value.  Our meals (Peking Pork, Chef's Chicken Duo and Pot Stickers) were fresh, yummy, plentiful and well-priced.  But holy shit, the service sucked from the second we walked in the door.  Seriously, I'm way low maintenance - give me a smile and get my drink order filled and I'm typically satisfied.  We arrived and watched at least four employees walk by the hostess station several times without so much as a glance in our direction.  It wasn't crowded.  When we were finally seated our server took and delivered our drink/appetizer orders quickly but things quickly deteriorated. After my husband placed his order our server started to walk away....we seriously had to grab her and remind her that she forgot to take my order.  (Two top, not that hard, right?)   My Peking pork was the first dish to arrive via the expediter.  When we inquired about the pancakes promised on the menu we were told that the "waitress was supposed to tell us they were out of them.".  No apology, no further acknowledgement.  Dude just left the scene.  We were never asked if we needed anything else, never asked if our meal was okay.  We didn't see our server again until she stopped by the table with the receipt (check was already paid; it was dropped off by the hostess after we waited unattended for 10-15 minutes).  Server launched the two fortune cookies sitting on top of the bill onto the table and left without a word.  Not a word.  I wish I was making this up.    Not even going to detail the clunky and confusing drink service, food delivery or the pitiful attempt to box up our meal.  I'm too frustrated.  At one point we overheard the guy sitting at the table next to us ask the kid filling water glasses if he could send his waitress over....kid's response:  "Was it Helen or Theresa?" (can't remember the real names)......diner's response: "I have no idea."  Considering each server had exactly three tables to cover you'd think the staff would have some inclination of exactly what the fuck was going on, but no.  Bottom line:  Quite literally the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant.  I wish I were exaggerating.  The owners should be proud of their food but utterly embarassed by their staff.  FIre 'em all and start over.

Eek, bad review city up in here!  I actually think CityScape is a good step in the right direction.  I've worked in downtown Phoenix for nearly ten years, and it's finally starting to show a pulse, thanks in a big way to CityScape and the latest outpost of ASU.  Every restaurant in CS is packed during lunch hour.  Seeing people down here during "happy" hours?  Unheard of until now.    CS houses several dining and shopping options, and it's extremely nice to have all of them at my disposal during working hours.  Previously I'd have to drive to Tempe or Arcadia to enjoy good food and good shopping options in the same place.  I no longer live in the area so I'm not sure what happens after dark, but I wish this complex nothing but the best!

Wow!  I've had two friends recommend Zoolikins now and I definitely wasn't disappointed!    This is THE resource for cloth diapering in AZ.  I was overwhelmed with information when I decided I wanted to use cloth and the ladies at Zoolikins were happy to show me several different options and steer me in the right direction with laundering.  They even offer classes on cloth diapering and baby-wearing.  Awesome!  Beyond the diaper section they have a good selection of other natural products for babies and kids...tons of REALLY cute things.

I really enjoyed Greek Pita.  It's a really cute, exceptionally clean space with an open kitchen.  We tried the gyro sandwich, falafel and baba ganoush and enjoyed everything.  Prices were really, really reasonable.  Can't wait to try some other items! Also the gal working the counter has the coolest eye makeup ever.   That is all.  :)

Pretty dang good!  I tried the Barbacoa, Pibil and Queso Fundido tacos and all were great.  The Barbacoa was my fave, it had incredible depth of flavor and was extremely tender.  My husband preferred the Queso Fundido; perfectly salty & meaty. :) At $7 for 3 tacos it was a pretty good deal considering the quality of ingredients & location.  This shop is TINY though....only four tables inside and a few more out on the patio.  Once it gets hot I'll have to settle for take-out only.  Can't wait to try the Sonoran Dog!  :) Three cheers for a cool salsa bar too...

I also stumbled in to Olive Creations completely by accident, and I must say, I'm completely smitten!  What an awesome concept.  They have tons of flavored olive oils and balsamic vinegars (in addition to some stellar standard options) and some really tasty mustards, jellies and spreads and some specialty pastas.  Most everything is locally made, which is awesome.   The best part?  You can sample EVERYTHING.  OMG.  I must have tried at least 15 different things, and everything I tried was amazing.  I ended up purchasing a variety pack: you get to pick four sample-sized bottles (probably around 4 ounces each) of any of the flavors (truffle oils excluded for obvious reasons).  I chose the Sicilian Lemon White Balsamic Vinegar, the 18-year aged Balsamic Vinegar, the Cilantro and Roasted Onion Olive Oil and the Wild Mushroom and Sage Olive Oil.  I also picked up a jar of some amazing tequila jalapeño mustard.  I'm already planning meals in my head, though I could seriously eat any of these with just a loaf of crusty bread.  Dangerous.   It was really hard to choose which flavors to buy...I can't wait to go back for some of the Lavendar Balsamic, the Blood Orange Olive Oil and one or two of the garlic spreads....outrageously good!  Everything is really reasonably priced - easily on par with or lower than what you'd expect to find at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.  The staff is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable - I could have spent hours in here. Also, hello, new go-to hostess gift!  They package everything in super cute gift boxes or fancy bags.  They also had a few prepackaged gift baskets which will be great for the holidays.  I'm SO glad they are located in my neck of the woods so I can stop by whenever I want, but trust me when I say it's worth the drive!

Yummy and cheap!  Can't beat that...... the bread is reminiscent of Cousin's bread to me (which I love), but the quality of the meat was waaaaaaaaay better.   This location is close to my work, and parking is easy (and free with validation) in the underground lot at CityScape, so I'll definitely be back!

Add me to the growing list of fans..... this is an awesome place; another well thought out Sam Fox concept.  The Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel roll is one of the better sandwiches I've ever had.    Lunch is a bit pricey; but perfect for entertaining out of town clients, etc.  The wait staff is amazing; very attentive and friendly.

Zero complaints!  I'm 7 months pregnant and the bartender made me a super-fancy cucumber/ginger concoction so I could feel like I was part of coctail hour - seriously one of the best cocktails I've ever had, liquor or no liquor!  I HIGHLY recommend the brown bag chicken sandwich; the addition of hazelnuts and blue cheese absoultely makes it.  The mixed grain salad definitely lives up to the hype.  And Jo's Church Potatoes (we call these funeral potatoes or Mormon potatoes in Salt Lake) were to die for (haha, get it?  to DIE for?  Funeral potatoes?  never mind).    I can't wait to go back post-baby and try some of the fabulous boozy drinks!

This is a really cool place - HUGE outdoor desert bar.  I haven't tried any of the food yet but the drinks were cheap and served quickly.  There were WAY too many kids running around (after 10:00 PM) so that was kind of a buzz kill, but I'm sure their parents were happy to have somewhere they could go and have fun and still bring the kids.  Just don't blink if you're looking for the entrance from the one-way frontage road just north of Jomax!

Great addition to the CityScape lineup!  This is a big place with TONS of beers on tap, sweet cushy leather seats and friendly employees.  So far I've only been for happy hour, which is great because they offer deep discounts on local beers.  I'm definitely looking forward to sampling some of the food options.   My one complaint - most of the songs we heard here (I've yet to see a live band here) were horribly outdated top 40 hits that I wish I had forgotten about.  Clearly that's a matter of taste though ;) Looking forward to going back!

I'm pretty pleased with Plaza Bonita.  WAY better than its predecessor, Ketzall.  PB has done a terrific job updating the decor and making the interior feel special - if it weren't for the huge plate glass windows you'd forget you're in a strip mall.  The menu is diverse, with lots of options beyond the typical Sonoran favorites.  So far I've had a wonderful beef chalupa and super moist pork tamale.   I totally appreciate bean options - you can get regular refried, whole pinto, or whole black beans here.   One negative - I didn't particularly care for the salsa, it was a bit too runny and bland for me.  Otherwise, this is good utility Mexican food!  Keep it up, PB!

So first off, a disclaimer: I still love this place.  A lot.  They do utility (Sonoran-Style) Mexican food like no other in the immediate vicinity.   BUT ("There's always a big butt." - PeeWee Herman) the fish tacos taste EXACTLY like a Big Mac.  It's the combo of mayo/pickle relish and shredded lettuce.  I'll never be able to disassociate.  The fish was kind of weird too, now that I think about it.  Sad, overcooked nuggets of farm-raised failure.    Salsa? Still runny, but better flavor than I remember.  Service? Great.  Prices? Wonderful. Margaritas? Cheap, at least during happy hour.  Beef/Chicken Tacos?  Stellar.   Okay, so just don't order the fish tacos.  ;)

I'm super happy to have Emerald in the neighborhood!    They have a full stock of pool chemicals & accessories at reasonable prices, a new construction/remodeling design center and a full service department.    We've been using Emerald to test our chemical levels (free) and make any necessary recommendations.  Every employee has been completely honest, expedient and extremely helpful without any of the annoying sales gimmicks you would expect from a pool supply store.    Sweet!
