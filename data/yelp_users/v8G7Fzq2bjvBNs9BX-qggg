My favorite Thai on the west side! The Tom Yum Kai and Panang Curry are AMAZING! Hint: Get the Panang Curry with Salmon AND Beef!

After having our first date at Akai Hana Sushi we were amazingly pleased with our service and the quality of our food.  Being creatures of habit we chose to revisit the restaurant for our Anniversary yesterday and the service was much less than what we had come to expect from Akai Hana.  Our server, Kevin, was polite and forgot to bring us plates, napkins and our drink refills.  After canceling our second round of beverages we left.  I attempted to call and speak with a manager or owner and was hung up on.  I am sad to say that we will not be revisiting the location of our FIRST DATE and truly hope they can work out the details to make their restaurant as good as it was before.
