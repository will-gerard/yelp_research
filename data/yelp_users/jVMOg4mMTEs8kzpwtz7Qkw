For a special occasion (my daughter's birthday) my family made reservations at Geordie's at the Wrigley Mansion for their Sunday brunch. First of all, the atmosphere is fabulous...gorgeous old mansion with wonderful architectural accents and the view....well it is easily the best in the valley. We have been here before and usually it was crowded but yesterday it was practically a ghost town. It is expensive, and times are tough, and of course it is summer in the valley...but still there was no one in the bar and only one of the beautiful rooms was being used to seat diners.  The brunch is lovely, with all the typical stuff: made to order omelets, salad bar, breakfast breads a plenty and the two things that are MOST important to my husband: big cold shrimp and carved prime rib! Our service was impeccable and wonderfully friendly. For a lovely, delicious brunch with some class, check it out!

Went to this site to meet a work friend for lunch on a Weds. Got there early (around 11:30) and it was a good thing, because the place filled up fast. Mostly with business people, but some 'snowbirds' too.  The food is good, I had the turkey burger and it was a little well done, but not bad. Their gumbo is really good...had a cup of that for my 'side.' Very friendly service from the hostess to our server. I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but Charleston's is an exception from time to time...and especially for a nice lunch meeting.

I often stop here for lunch when I am in the area of West Mesa. I love their Cobb Salad...chopped very fine with lots of blue cheese crumbles and avocado (my favorite parts of a Cobb!) I have them 'toss' it for me...much easier to eat that way. It comes with your choice of muffin...and they are so HUGE I save it for breakfast the next day!  I also go to the Mimi's in Chandler...just as good. They also have good weekend breakfast/brunches. I like that their only advertisement is 'word of mouth' and the word is...yummy!

I like this 'fast food' option...something different and a little healthier when you are on the go. Their original on sourdough in a favorite. I have only used the drive through, and they were fast and friendly.

Stopped in for lunch today and was surprised to get a great lunch for $8! Since I had never had lunch there (I have ordered take out pizzas for dinner and I knew I liked the pizza!) I am sure I had a perplexed look on my face when the manager asked if I wanted the lunch special. He very patiently and kindly explained how it worked: Order a slice and add either a salad, garlic knots or wings. I chose the mushroom and pepperoni (they will add what you want on a cheese pizza if you don't see what you like on display)  So,,,great salad, slice and a fountain drink for $8!! A much better deal than any sub or chicken place that is for sure!

Ah...Friday night, the work week is over and I love to stop at Aj's to pick up a great dinner. The fresh fish is the best...Ahi, Salmon, Halibut, and more. And they have it 'plain' or prepared. The pecan crusted trout is so yummy. And pick up a stuffed jumbo potato while you are there and you are set. You can also get great veggies and salad stuff and the bakery is not bad too. Good wine selection (a little pricey) but this is definately NOT the place to do your 'stock up' type shopping....most shelf items are way over-priced. But for a great gourmet meal it is the place! Tonight's meal? BBQ jerk halibut, stuffed potatoes and cesear salad....all courtesy of Aj's!

I had my first root canal yesterday and I have to say that today that tooth feels better than it has in a year! It is still a little sore around where they were working on it, but no big deal at all. And there was absolutely NO PAIN during the procedure!  If you ever need an endodontist, he is a keeper! I loved that he introduced himself as "Mike" The procedure was totally painless and he explained every step of the way. His assistant, Tyson, was delightful too.

Stopped by here for a late lunch (around 2) on a Saturday and the place was still packed!! This downtown Gilbert area is jumping on Saturdays...probably helped along by the huge downtown farmers market nearby.  We ordered at the counter and then sat at the designated spot (a server gives you a number and then places that number on a table which makes for easier seating and no one can 'save' tables) We ordered sandwiches...delish! Mine was the Maiden Lane (turkey and brie) and I ordered it pressed. My side was the sweet potato salad...which was amazing too. My friend's sandwich (Egg salad) was not quite as good and her side (regular potato salad) was good, but not as yummy as mine!  The only downside was the noise level..lots of families, kids etc. But the food was great and we shall return...maybe for dinner next time. And I HAVE to try something from their baked goods display. WOW, that pecan roll looked fabulous!

I stop in here from time to time with a friend who lives locally. We really enjoy their chicken cobb salad and have never ordered anything else! I have to say that the people who work here are all VERY friendly. Everyone greets you and the atmosphere is really relaxed and enjoyable. I know this is a 'chain' but this one feels like a local hangout with friendly people!

I love coming to see productions at this intimate theater in Fountain Hills. I went to see their latest (and controversial!) production of The Full Monty. For a non contract (or 'professional' ) theater, the show was outstanding!!! And there isn't a bad seat in the house...but they do sell out quickly, so if you are interested in seeing a production, get your tickets quickly, and never try to buy them at the door!

I have to say I friggin' love this little Mom and Pop Italian place...and especially around the holidays. They really 'desk the halls' and particularly in the bar area (which is really large and has lots of tables as it has not changed since the "smoking section' era.)  After an event in downtown Tempe a group of 7 of us decided to go here for pasta last Sunday evening. Although there was a wait (for 8 people that is expected) in an almost empty restaurant, we were seated in the bar (yay!) and Andrew our waiter come over to tell us "I don't have much to say except there are no specials tonight, and the vegetable of the day is green beans." Don't you love it? And he was witty and attentive the whole evening!  Most of us had the famous spaghetti and meatballs and the salad with their homemade blue cheese dressing....the yummiest! One person tried the lasagna and one the pizza, and both looked fabulous. And we topped it off with a bottle of their house (Ruffino) Chianti..well, actually 3 bottles. We stayed for a couple hours just eating, talking and laughing and enjoying the holiday atmosphere. It was a really lovely evening. Thanks Riazzi's.....

I have been going to the same massage therapist for over a year now. Recently she moved to this spa and I have to say, I am thrilled because it is practically in my backyard! The spa is quiet and calming. And the tables are warmed and padded....makes you want to just drift off into happy land! If you go, ask for Katibelle, for the massage of a lifetime!

I have been going to Dr. Caserta for over 10 years. All of this time I have been 'borderline for glaucoma.' My other eye doc wanted to start me on medication years ago, but Dr. Caserta follows me every year, and to date I have not had to deal with medications. He is open and honest with me and my progress (or lack of it!) and discusses everything in a manner I understand.  I have never had anything but wonderful service here.

Day 2 of Az Restaurant week fared sooo much better! We made reservations at Top of the Rock. We had been there about five years ago for some occasion....birthday or something. We remembered it being good and the view to be fabulous...and we were not disappointed once again. We were seated immediately and our server (Rod) was friendly and had a good sense of humor. He was thrilled we were there for Restaurant week (good start!)  My husband started with the seared Ahi and I had the Gnocchi. Both tasted fabulous and the presentation was lovely! Our main courses (he had lamb, I had salmon) were also terrific. My salmon was perfectly cooked with an interesting chutney like topping and asparagus. Yum. And for desert we had bananas foster and the molten lava chocolate cake! Now THIS was a fabulous menu and so worth the price! Obviously Top of the Rock was showcasing their wares and wanted us to come back! And we will!

On the way to the cooler parts of Arizona (Prescott/Flagstaff) you have to be sure you are driving through this part of your trip around lunch time, because a stop at the Rock Springs Cafe is a must. Pulling off the highway in what looks to be the middle of nowhere, is this rickety looking cafe and 'gift shop' with an even quirkier looking 'farmers market' attached. Skip that and head straight into the cafe! The sandwiches are pretty good...I usually get the wild turkey that comes grilled on sourdough with bacon and tomato...yum! The burgers are pretty good too. Yesterday when we stopped (Thurs at noonish) the place was already full but the manager found us a table by rearranging the room a little. Nice! But the BEST part of this place is definitely the pie. If you were raised on Marie Calendar, you may not enjoy it quite as much as those of us raised on our Grandma's homemade pies because that is what these taste like. They may not always be 'picture perfect' but that sure taste fabulous! I had the crumb peach...oh man fresh peaches hand sliced. My husband had their famous Jack Daniels Pecan...also a keeper. Ya gotta go....just for the pie. And of course you can buy whole ones to go.

The MAC is a lovely venue...with numerous theaters and a very eclectic schedule of events. It is the home of Southwest Shakespeare, Class 6 Theater, and Mesa Encore Theater, but it also has touring artists such as Lyle Lovett and Olivia Newton John. Parking is adequate and, unless there is a big name on stage, it is free. Be prepared, however, to have to pay....you never know when. There is some street parking available.  The grounds are lovely and well maintained. My biggest issue has NOTHING to do with the MAC and everything to do with downtown Mesa. There are no after hours places to walk to after an event if you want to have a drink or even a coffee.

I have been hearing about this place for months now, but it is so far from where I live I just haven't been able to get out there. So when I had to meet up with someone in East Mesa, she suggested RW&B.  We got there early for lunch on a Thursday (11:30) and glad we did because it filled up quickly! The service was great...the manager was opening the doors for people and welcoming them when we arrived. Our server was prompt and pleasant. We checked out the menu, and although this place is known for the fish, I had the California Turkey Burger and my friend the house salad with chicken added. The burger was perfect and served with provolone, roasted red peppers and avocados along with a delicious garlic/sundried tomato aioli on the side.  Although this place is far far away, I know I will be back to try the dinners....can't wait!

We have been ordering pizza (delivery) from Rosati's ever since we moved here 10 years ago. It is simply the best medium priced delivery pizza in the whole valley. And they often have coupons (which makes it even more affordable) We are pretty much stuck on the thin crust and usually order the 'classic combo' with meat and veggies. Always fresh, always delivered piping hot, and always yummy. And we don't mind the square cut because I like the outside crust and my husband prefers the inside pieces...perfect!

After spending over 4 hours buying a new car on MacDowell, my husband and I were starving and ready for a nice big drink!  He had the idea to backtrack to Carlsbad Tavern; the perfect spot to unwind, relax and enjoy some great food. We sat at the bar (late afternoon and the place was pretty empty) and the bartender was delightful! Also, a couple of the servers were off duty and sat down to chat. We enjoyed the banter and the obvious friendship and felt priviledged to be included!  They have a nice happy hour menu (early 'bat' specials, ha ha)  with appetizers and drink specials. But we went straight for the blue corn enchiladas (one chicken and one shrimp is how they come, but you can have them other ways) on their regular menu. Delicious! And the margaritas are really good...tart with lots of lime, not like those extra sweet ones you sometimes get in Mexican restaurants. The menu includes other New Mexican specialties and burgers that are supposed to be out of this world.  We inhaled our food (and a couple margaritas!) and felt so much better driving home in the new car!

I have been going to see Dave and Rick with my pets for over 10 years now. They are simply the best...so attentive and kind as are all of the staff. Don't be put off by the goofy name..they are very professional and experienced. It is kind of hard to see from the street, but the office is in the corner of the strip mall on the northwest corner of Rural and Elliot.

Good bagels and a fair price. I wait for the coupon in the Sunday paper and buy the 'hate to wait' dozen with 2 cream cheese tubs. I slice them and freeze them, pulling out a bagel to toast whenever I am in the mood. There are two EB bagels near me, but I like this one. They are usually not quite a packed and you can get in and out quickly.

Since I work right around the corner from this Tempe restaurant, this is a go to place for weekday lunch. But you better get there early, because the small restaurant fills up fast. Good, fresh and tasty Mexican food. I usually get the chicken/avocado salad and then add a lot of the red chili sauce. You have your choice of dressing too, and I go with the jalapeno ranch.  They have a drive through for take out, but you have to call ahead.

This is the BEST 'fast food Chinese' in the valley. I eat here at least twice a month for lunch as I work near by. The food is fresh and plentiful. I love the pad Thai (but not as spicy as some like) and the Orange Chicken with brown rice. There is something for everyone here...including my very picky vegan son! And the manager/owner is so nice, he always has a smile and sometimes (if he is not busy taking orders or busing tables) he carries on conversations with his guests like they are friends. Fresh ingredients, atmosphere, friendly service!

Sadly, I went to pick up my yummy food last Friday night and there was a sign inside saying they were CLOSING 12/20 due to the fact they had lost their lease!!! After drying my tears, I asked what happened and the server told me the landlord didn't renew the lease and instead is leasing to a 'burger joint' WHAT???  I am heart broken! I sincerely hope they decide to find another place in the area soon!! There are open spaces in the strip mall at Kyrene/Elliot (hint hint)

As often as I go here (about 2 to 3 times a month) I can't believe I haven't written a review!  I LOVE AZ88!! I go here for lunch with girlfriends and have the fabulous AZ88 salad with ice tea, or martinis with friends (the best in town!) and an appetizer or two to share. The food is plentiful and delicious, a big step up from 'bar' food, but not fancy and not pricey either. The staff is always friendly and attentive. When the weather is nice, they have a lovely patio that actually looks out on a green belt/park area and not a parking lot! But indoors is also a treat with fabulous art and a modern design. If you go at the holidays you can also see their annual "tree" in the dead center of the restaurant. Always a wonderful work of art!

What a great spot! Fez is the best place for friendly gatherings and good food! I recently went there with 4 others for an early lunch. We arrived at 11:30 and had no trouble finding a table, but trust me, don't try it around noon. The place is full of folks by then!  As always, I got the chicken wraps...they are simply the best! They include (along with lots of chicken, of course) dried pears, dates and cherries along with almonds and a pomegranate dressing. It is so delish and refreshing! And, since this was a 'not doing anything but going back to the pool' kinda day, I had a gSpot: fresh grapefruit juice with grapefruit vodka and club soda over ice. YUM.  My friends had burgers...and the biggest hit was the Fez Burger: with cinnamon pears, feta and crispy onions along with a molasses BBQ sauce to die for.  The biggest issue when this place is busy is the parking. The FedEx store right next door has all of the best parking marked off for their customers. A couple times I have had to search for street parking. So go early (or late) to be sure!

Thank heavens for Camelview...there is really no other place even moderately close to me that shows interesting independent, foreign and art films. During the hot summer months, my friends and I try to hit up a movie here at least once a week. The  people who work here are friendly and helpful. A couple of the theaters are really small, so be sure to get there early if your movie is showing in one of them. Also, the restrooms are very small...so be prepared for lines when the show is over!

I LOVE this place! I wish I could live/work there!  If you are a cook, this is a must visit place. Penzy's has every spice, herb, and seasoning you can imagine...as well as blends that they have concocted themselves! AND, they have recipes to use them in! If you sign up for their seasonal catalog, you will get dozens of ideas for cooking and baking. And they usually have coupons for a free jar of something in each catalog. They also have gift packs for easy giving for holidays and birthdays etc. The perfect gift for the chef in your life!  Their mission statement: "Love people, cook them good food." says it all!

What is it about VinciTorios that I love so much? See, it isn't just ONE thing....it's everything. My husband and I eat here about once a month. Sometimes an early dinner and sometimes the lunch buffet. And everytime we go we say "We ought to eat here more often" This time we are sticking to it!  I arrived last night around 6 with no reservation. My husband was coming from somewhere else and so first to arrive grabs the table. (This is a small place and nowhere to wait for a table, so either you make reservations or go early for dinner!) I managed to get the last available table (yay!) and was seated promptly. And as always greeted by the owner. We ordered a drink (wine and beer only, no full bar) and I had what I always order: the tortellini aurora. Oh man, this is so yum...cheese tortellini w/ fresh mushrooms and peas in a tomato cream sauce. My husband (who always orders some sort of veal) decided to be different and order the lasagna. Delicious!  When I looked around the place, there were tables of people laughing talking and enjoying the atmosphere and food. The open seating makes you feel like part of a big family. And our waiter (sorry I am having a senior moment and can't recall his name, but he has been our waiter before) was delightful as always. Attentive and friendly. When we left the owner once again thanked us for coming in. It is almost like we were his guests.  The only issues are: parking can be a little difficult on a weekend night as it is close to the cheap movie theater. And the live entertainment is not necessary and not that good. The man on the electric guitar singing 60-70 hits by John Sebastian or the Beatles was really out of place. I like the house canned music so much better!

I really really wanted to like this place. We have been looking for a close local bar & grill in Tempe with good draft beer choices, good food and a comfortable atmosphere. We got there early (around 5 for dinner) and pretty much had the place to ourselves. The server was friendly and sweet, and pretty attentive but....and this is the main issue...the food was pretty awful. I ordered a patty melt which turned out to be a thin, dry hamburger with a few onions on top and very bland cole slaw. My husband tried a steak (over cooked for his med-rare order) and once again, bland potatoes and veggies. Overall nothing to rave about. Darn. We live in Tempe and like to spend our money in Tempe establishments, but I guess it is back to Chandler and Teakwoods!

My husband and I tried this restaurant last night on recommendations from a friend. It was a Tuesday night around 7:30, and we were dressed casually, so when the hostess told us we could sit in the bar area (which is very large) we opted for that. Probably not the best choice, because as the night went on the music got louder.  We found their wine list adequate and ordered a lovely bottle of Valley of the Moon sangiovese. That was probably the best thing we had all night, sadly. Our server was lovely, I must say. Very charming and upbeat. We ordered the calamari appetizer to share, which was pretty good. The batter and sauce were tasty, the squid a little chewy. But I liked that it came with a salad of romaine and tomatoes on the side. Good combination! Then came the entrees..I had the Veal Marsala and my husband ordered the New York Steak medium rare. The Veal was good and tender, but the mushroom sauce tasted like it came right out of a can. My husbands steak was cooked medium well, not rare, which he was very grumpy about. And the veggies they served along side were cold and hard and obviously frozen. One more chance: dessert. We ordered a tiramisu to share...on the recommendation of our server....and it was very ordinary, and tasted like it came from a grocery store.  I have heard this place does have a great happy hour and I saw they did grey goose martinis (my favorite) If we were ever to return, I wouldn't mind trying those! And probably munch on the calamari....and forget the rest of the food.

Great little breakfast spot right around the corner from home. Delicious baked goods and decent lattes. Their egg dishes are also good. They have 3 or 4 specials of the day posted at the register....and I have never been disappointed. They have a few outside tables, but they are right on the sidewalk and you are looking at the parking lot. No views to speak of. Very large and clean inside and you order at the counter, and they bring it to you.  Ordering 'to go' does take quite awhile if you are ordering anything from the kitchen, but it is easy to grab a bagel/muffin and coffee.  The owners are also very involved in the community, and always sponsor a food drive during the holidays. I recommend that you support this local restaurant!

Ah! Arizona Restaurant Week! A chance to try restaurants we never have before and get a taste of what they have to offer! My husband and I were excited about going to Donovans; a restaurant we had heard a lot about....great word of mouth!  My husband made the comment that restaurants were going to use this opportunity in one of two ways: Either to look at it as a chance to showcase their best or a chance to make money and serve low cost, sub-par food. Sadly, Donovan's chose the latter.  Our reservation was for 7:15. Upon arrival the place was packed..standing room only at the hostess station! We were told they were 'running behind a bit' and so we elbowed our way to the bar and ordered drinks. In about 15 minutes, the hostess came and found us (OK, that's fine, I don't mind a 15 minute wait for a reservation) She showed us to a small table near the back close to the wait station. OK, fine, not the best seat in the house, but still OK. When we asked for the 'special menu' as we were told to do so by the website, she placed it on the table and handed us the regular menu and wine list. OK, I get it, they would rather have us order off the other menu. Undaunted, we shared the special menu and made our decisions. We both decided to start with the house chop salad: in a word, horrible. Store bagged lettuce, carrots and red cabbage with bland Italian dressing that was in the same league as Wishbone. My entree fared better: the fillet medallions were tasty, but the side of mashed potatoes was bland and just OK....and the 2 baby carrots for veggies was pretty much just plate 'dressing.' However, my husband got a rib eye steak that was a flat as a pancake and just about as juicy. Terrible. For dessert the only real choice was creme brulee (as the other choices were a scoop of ice cream or a scoop of sherbet...come on!) We did see pieces of strawberry cheesecake and some kind of fudge cake on other tables. Why couldn't they just give us a smaller piece of  that?  But even worse than the food was the service. As soon as our waiter discovered we were not going to order an $80 bottle of wine or a $60 seafood appetizer, he disappeared into thin air. At one point we actually had to flag down a busboy to order another round of drinks!  At the end of this debacle, I stopped in the ladies room before heading home....and low and behold...no toilet tissue in ANY of the stalls! Did I discretely whisper this to the hostess upon leaving? Heck no!  She probably wouldn't have cared!

I love these people! I have been here to print copies and to cut and bind scripts and they are always pleasant and helpful. But the BEST reason I go here is to pick up my wine delivery from a wine club in California. As you may be aware, alcohol cannot be delivered without an adult signature to accept it, so when you aren't home during the day for deliveries, they hold it for you here. And since it is just around the corner from my house it is so convenient!

My husband and I go here every week for a great 'neighborhood bar' dinner. The staff is always courteous and helpful and seem to be having a good time. I enjoy a place where people like to work!  We go on Monday or Tuesday night to get the summer special these days. Join the Picazzo's club and you get 25% off your order and a bottle of the house wine (which isn't a bad one!) for just $5!  Last night we had the Thai chicken pizza (with the thin crust) and the Italian chopped salad. Delicious! Another favorite of ours is the Veggie Pizza (with thick crust) and the blue cheese salad. You can order a small salad (plenty for 2 to share) So,,,for $30 we had split a small salad, a large pizza and a bottle of wine!  By the way, the summer special is only for dinner on Mon/Tues (after 4) and through September.

N2T consistently mounts excellent productions in the Phoenix Theater Little Theater. They present raw and edgy productions of new and classic theater. I have been attending theatre there ever since I moved to the valley, and I am seldom disappointed. Their recent production of "Equus" was stellar. This award winning theatre company is all volunteer and deserves full houses at every production.

Love BevMo's 5 cent wine sale! And now it is all the time and you can even mix and match. What a great way to try new wines!  I only wish this store was larger. The one at Tempe Marketplace is bigger and had a better selection, but it farther away for me.

Truly a jewel in the desert this lovely venue is the home of the nationally acclaimed children' s theatre "Childsplay" and also is home to numerous musical and dance groups. There used to be a Tempe Community Theatre also, but sadly they went out of business. The venue features 2 theaters and a lovely art studio along with the "Lakeside Room" that is used for events such as weddings and company dinners. The venue is situated on Tempe Town Lake and the views from the large windows at the back are breath taking. Even if you don't go to an event here, it is worth it to drop by to see the venue itself.

Met a friend for an early dinner here on a Tuesday night. Very small place, but there were plenty of tables available. The wait staff is really friendly and knowledgeable. I had the delicious lasagna and my friend had the Italian Stallion (all meat and lots of it!) pizza. We both had wine and just relaxed and enjoyed each other, the wine and the good food. Although I do not live in the west valley, I will find time to head over to downtown Glendale again just for this place. I still have to try the pizza!

My husband and I decided to stop here yesterday for an early dinner and arrived around 5 PM. The place was pretty empty, so when the hostess asked us if we wanted a booth or table, I responded with: "doesn't matter really, just a good spot."Well the spot she chose was a booth right next to their big smoker that was as hot as a furnace and radiating that heat big time! Coming in from 113 degrees, I knew we were never going to be able to sit there, so when the waiter came to the table I asked (very politely) if we could be moved. He said he would 'have to check with the front desk' and drifted away. Finally he came back and said we would have to move to a table and we said that's great! And of course he moved us right next to a table with a screaming baby. Payback I guess for asking.... Anyway, on to the food... I have to say that I was a little taken aback by the lack of any 'early bird specials' on food or beverages. In this economy even Flemings is doing a great happy hour! We ordered ribs (I had the baby back and my husband had the St. Louis) The waiter said we had 2 sides and I asked for a salad. He said that was not one of the choices, and it would be $1.75 more. OK. So I finally decided on the garlic mashed potatoes and the beans.  The biscuits they brought to start the meal were really good with the honey cinnamon butter. But only 2? Come on, be a little more generous. The salads arrived and they were pretty much the stock salad, nothing fabulous. Then the plates came, and I have to say the BBQ ribs were just OK. Nothing great, and kinda dry. And the sides were fine, but nothing to write home about.  I don't think I would have been so disappointed if it weren't for the fact that the meal (along with 2 large beers and NO dessert) was $80 before tip! Come on, that is ridiculous. We can eat at Joes or Daves for half that.  So....will I return? No, probably not. If I am going to spend $100 for dinner, I can go to the Keg just down the way a little and get a much better meal.

If you are over in the West Valley and want to stay away from the Cardinals stadium and all that craziness, just up the freeway a couple exits is a row of restaurants/bars right off the Northern Exit. Easy access and lots of parking.  To be honest, I have only ever had drinks and appetizers here. One time it was late night (after 10 PM) and the place was pretty empty. Great service that night. The other time it was happy hour on a Saturday. CROWDED!! and service was slow, but only because our server had tons of tables to deal with.  Overall, I like the food. We had flatbread pizzas, artichoke dip and sliders. Not bad bar food. The place is nice, clean and large.

I have been going to Melinda as my stylist here in Tempe for 10 years, so when she opened her own shop WAY over in Mesa, I continued to see her. She is a fabulous stylist and a lovely person too. Her salon has the most fabulous clothes (not my size or style, but really darling) and the greatest fashion jewelry around...and soooo affordable! Every month I go in for my haircut and buy a new pair of earrings...!! Melinda flies to LA on a monthly basis to do her own buying at the Mart there. She has fabulous taste...as you will see the minute you walk in the door! Check it out!

Stopped in here prior to a performance at the MAC (which is right across the street) I was early for dinner; around 5:45 PM and the place was completely empty. I was a little concerned about that, but it was early and it was a week night too.  My server, Derek, told me I could sit anywhere and I chose a table by the window (it was a little too chilly to sit outside) I asked for a wine list, but he said they didn't have one because they were creating a new one (?) OK, fine, but what wines do you have?? He said he would go ask. Hmmmm. He came back with water and a menu after talking to the bartender, and asked me if I wanted red or white wine. Still a little confused about this I said I wanted a glass of chardonnay and ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. He came back with a delicious chardonnay (no clue what it was and he didn't offer) and later a delicious plate of pasta (it wasn't fettuccine like the menu said but linguine) alfredo. The sauce was heavy on the garlic but delicious and creamy. The portion was large and came with garlic toast points that were really good too. The food and wine were really very good, and Derek was a delight. I'm glad I stopped by....and hope to be back soon. Maybe they will have a wine list next time??

I love this Farmer's Market! It is year round every Sunday. Easy to find and lots of parking. There are 4 different fresh veggie/fruit vendors usually (which is the main reason I go) along with other interesting items (baked goods, tamales, hummus, herbs, etc.) The market opens at 9 AM but will start opening at 8 in June for the hot summer months.

This sub shop is right around the corner from where I live, so I manage to stop by often. My husband and I always get the same thing....the tuna sub on wheat. One of these days we have to branch out, but the tuna is really good. And they have LOTS of optional veggies for the sandwiches that we love. Friendly staff too! And they have a frequent users club so eventually you get your sub for free. Can't beat that!

I am so grateful they decided to open one of these stores less than 5 miles from my house! They have thousands of labels as well as an excellent assortment of beers and spirits and the prices are very competitive.  I like that they have the wines divided into countries as well as by type. I also appreciate the 'recommendations' from the staff that are posted. I am a big California wine drinker, but I also enjoy trying something made locally as well as from other places. I also like that now they have the multi bottle (6) discount.

As some of the other reviewers, I waited until I had given this locally owned place a few chances...2 times for breakfast and once for an early dinner.  I have to say I did enjoy the breakfasts (pancakes once and farmers omelet the second) The food was very good, but the wait and the service were big strikes. I totally understand the wait for breakfast on a Sunday morning...it is a busy place with folks going to the farmers market nearby. First time we waited 20 minutes. The second time we waited almost 30. We had said we would take inside or outside, but for some reason the hostess heard only the 'outside.'  When we went for early dinner, the place was pretty deserted. We ordered a beer (they have Kiltlifter on tap, which is our fav) and then we waited and waited. After 15 minutes the beer came, and before we could say we wanted to order the server dashed away. We waited another 5 minutes or so, he came back and we ordered the cheeseburgers...medium. 20 minutes later they came out...so well done they were practically dry. Big disappointment. The server we had never came back, didn't ask if we wanted another beer, etc. so when we were through we went up to the hostess and asked for our check. So silly when there were only 3 tables seated this whole time and no one on the patio (too hot) One server should be able to deal with 3 tables!!  All three times I went, I felt that the service was below par and the attitude being kinda 'who cares, I'll get around to it when I can.' And no one smiles at this place.  Darn, I really wanted this to be a local hang-out place for us.

I recently had to have surgery and I chose this place because of a strong recommendation for Dr. Buckmire. And I have to say, he was wonderful. He explained everything to me so I completely understood, and was kind and attentive. His staff are all wonderful too. I highly recommend him and this office.

Rigatony's is our 'go to' place for low cost high quality Italian food. Their dinners include salad (as much as you want!)  and yummy bread along with the entrees. All the pasta dishes are great...my favorite being the Chicken Parmesan. Good pizza too! And they have great lunch specials and a frequent customer card that gives you free and low cost items.  This is a busy, happy place to go...great for families. And they have a nice patio area.

Ah, restaurant week...my favorite! A chance to check out new 'favorite' places...and we found one!  I often meet friends for coffee at Mama Java's and right down the strip mall I have seen the place...Beckett's Table. But since I am always there during the day (they are only open in the evening) I had never been able to check them out.  We decided to go with the restaurant week set menu (which looked fabulous!) I had the zucchini cakes to start (amazingly delicious with green goddess dressing) and my spouse had the white grape gazpacho...very different and VERY good! He had the roasted pork loin for an entree which smelled fabulous and tasted even better!  I had the shepherds pie....not an A+ but pretty tasty. But the desserts were to come....and I had one of the most inventive and imaginative one ever: chocolate dipped bacon s'mores! WOW. An amazing experience!  The service was excellent....friendly but not intrusive. And I loved that everyone from the hostess to the servers remembered our name from the reservation.  Thanks for a great evening of food and relaxation! We will be back!

I just want to say, I LOVE this place! It is a small boutique wine and cheese store and I have never been disappointed by either the wine OR the cheese! They have wine tastings in store on a regular basis and I have discovered many great wines. The last tasting was Arizona wines (I love to be able to buy AZ wines!) and I discovered a couple new ones! They also have cheese plates available for holidays and special occasions. Although I am a cheese novice, I have always enjoyed the pre-selected plates. But you can make up your own too from their terrific selections.  This is a small Mom and Pop operation, and I encourage you to stop in and keep them in business! They bring a wonderful product and ambiance to the valley. Why buy bad cheese and cheap wine from a grocery store, when you can have 'nirvana' from this local shop!?

Arizona Restaurant Week is something we look forward to twice a year. It gives us a chance to sample the cuisine of places we have not been. This week we tried Tommy V's. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Wednesday night and when we arrived, the place was practically deserted. We were shown to a tiny table for 2 and we asked to be seated at a slightly larger table (my hubby is a big guy!) With only 3 other tables in the entire place full, I didn't think that was too much to ask. We were given the menus and after discussion, decided to chose from the regular menu. Not that the restaurant week menu wasn't fine, we just saw things we wanted on the other menu. However, one of the appetizers (the crab cakes) was not on the regular menu, so I asked if I could have those if I wasn't choosing the special menu. After some brief confusion on the part of the waiter, he said yes.  The first course arrived and the crab cake (not 'cakes' as written in the menu) was fine. My husband had the lettuce wedge salad which he said was delicious! It looked great too, not a huge slab of iceberg like many. For entrees I had the shrimp risotto, which was really great with huge lovely grilled shrimp and risotto cooked perfectly. Nicely seasoned and a very generous portion. Hubby had the Tommy V's pasta trio which he said was 'amazingly good' and when I took a bite I would agree. He had gin and tonics and I had the Ruffino Chianti (one of my favs with Italian food.) Overall I would give the food an A-. Service was a little slow, but our server was charming and friendly and we weren't in a rush.  The most interesting thing about the evening was something my H pointed out: he was the ONLY male customer in the place! All the other tables were groups of women!  We would definitely go back, and I would like to try lunch there...and maybe a happy hour.

We were thrilled when Oregano's opened a second Tempe location right around the corner from where we live! Their pizzas and salads are wonderfully fresh and flavorful. We have never tried the pasta...stuck on the great pizza. It is always crazy busy, no matter when you go, so just plan to hang out. Great for large groups and families too!

I almost didn't write this review after I read the others, because I am pretty much just echoing what has been said.  I don't mind serve yourself cafeteria style, but we had to lug these huge metal pans along with the menu through the line. Not an easy task. I asked for the brisket  sandwich and the line server asked if I like sauce. I said sure...so he loaded me up with the stuff already swimming in sauce. First big mistake. My sides were coleslaw and mac and cheese (both very bland and not worth more than one taste) My husband looked at the stuff on my tray and went with the tri-tip (no sauce) and beans and garlic potatoes. He was able to eat his sandwich and potatoes at least. I took one bite of the brisket and nearly gagged from the amount of vinegar in the sauce. And the meat had been in the tray so long, it was hard to tell if it really was meat. UGH.  No second chances, sorry. Just too much not to like.

I just LOVE having this place in downtown Gilbert! After seeing a show at Hale, it is great to have a place to get a nosh and a nice glass of wine...none of the other places stay open that late! I LOVE their artichoke dip and Hummus plate and their bruschetta is excellent also. Service can be a little slow sometimes....I don't think they always have enough servers in the later hours. But every server I have had has been pleasant and accomodating.

On my way home from an appointment...running late....lunch hour almost over....starving....and it is taco Tuesday! So I stopped in here for the first time. This place is pretty near my house and I was looking forward to having a Mexican food choice (other than Taco Bell) in the neighborhood.  The place was pretty quiet...and I was seated right away. My server (who was very nice and efficient) came over, and I ordered the taco special (Two beef tacos, rice and beans) I asked for ice tea with no lemon, and when she brought it, some really tall thin man appeared from the bar and told her she forgot the lemon. The waitress explained I ordered it that way. The man walked away. I had no idea who he was and he never said a word to me through the whole meal, but I assumed he was the floor manager. He must have walked by my table half a dozen times and never spoke....weird.  Anyway, on to the food. The chips/salsa and bean dip that came out were good...the chips were nice and crisp and the salsa was a little bland, but not bad. However, the taco plate was really bad. The taco shells were hard and the meat inside was so salty I could hardly eat it. The beans were pretty much just liquid...amazingly like the bean dip, so I assume it is the same stuff. Lots of rice and shredded lettuce on the plate..which is not what I really wanted to enjoy!  All in all, I don't think I will be back, even though they did give me a lunch club card (buy 5 lunches get one free) I had to laugh when I turned the card over I noticed someone had written on the back ...looked like a catering order!! Hope they don't miss it!

I have now been here twice and both times I found the food to be just OK and the service to be not so OK. Both times I went through the drive thru and both times the person waiting on me was less than helpful. When I got to the window this last time he just stood there talking to someone behind him for quite awhile, while I was holding my money out the window. Finally he turned around and grabbed the cash. I usually drop in a dollar or so when there is a tip jar out, but this time I decided not to. I took my change and he stood there looking at me and finally just shut the window. Another person later handed me my order. WTH?? I get better service from the 16 year old in the drive thru at my local Carls. And I feel much more appreciated as a customer!!

This was the first stop on our restaurant week agenda! My husband has driven by this on numerous occasions recently and this was his pick. Good pick!  We made a reservation for 7 on a Sunday night. We were greeted and seated almost immediately (bonus points for reservations meaning something!) It was loud (due to cement flooring and open ceiling) and there were quite a few families there with kids making noise, but it wasn't distracting...just sounded like everyone was having a good time. Our server (who never gave us her name) was courteous and efficient.   We ordered the red neck tacos to start...they sounded unique....BBQ meat, coleslaw and sauce on a pancake! They were good (especially the coleslaw!) but I suggest you add a little more sauce to them. There were 2 choices of sauce on the table...both really yummy.  For our entrees I had the catfish (NOT BREADED THANK GOD!) but wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked. It came with fresh string beans and dirty rice...both very good. The spouse had the ribs...and holy cow there was a mountain of them! He is a big eater and he could not finish them! He said they were delish and very meaty. They came with that great coleslaw and fries.  For dessert we split the apple cobbler...made just how I like it with lots of brown sugar, and topped with fresh vanilla ice cream.  For drinks, the spouse had his usual (boring) gin and tonic, but I tried the Firestone Brewery DBA. Really good!  Our bill was about $60...good value!  My husband is happy he found a new lunch place for the days he has to go to South Chandler for work. Check it out!

On my way to an appointment and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the sign for Togo's!! I thought they were all closed in the valley. I was so sad when the one by me was closed...and have not found a good chicken salad sandwich since! To my great pleasure, I stopped in and got the #29 (still the same!) fabulous chicken salad sandwich. The mix includes sliced almonds and celery and onions too. Yum! I don't know when I will get back to that neck of the woods again, but I will be sure to stop in at Togo's!

Opening less than a year ago, I had no idea this beautiful center was located in South Phoenix (Broadway and 16th St) I went to see a black history month presentation in their gorgeous performing arts center. What a lovely venue! I assume they use the space for worship too. I do hope that the center will be used for more performance art, especially for youth theater.

Restaurant #3 for restaurant week and I have to say the third time IS a charm!!! This fabulous little place that advertises 'comfort food' in a nondescript strip mall is hands down amazing!  Not exactly knowing what to expect (was this just another BBQ joint?) we were wonderfully surprised!  We arrived at 7:30 on a Thursday night (reservations made) and the hostess welcomed us and gave us a choice of 2 tables....the only ones available as the place was packed! (Good start!) Our server, Christina, was charming, knowledgeable and attentive. She even suggested my 'gin and tonic' husband try the Hendricks with cucumber instead of lime. He did and he loved it! I ordered a glass of Chardonnay (not the best, but this is a place where beers rule and I should have gone with that!)   I ordered the gnocchi which was toasted on the outside and creamy good inside! It came in a goat cheese sauce with mushrooms. My spouse had the pork tostadas...a meal in itself. He said they were very good.  Then came soup or salad...I had the broccoli cheddar with brown ale soup...wow, so fabulous with just the right amount of seasoned bacon and scallion for zest. Hubby had the grilled romaine salad with capers and he said it was the BEST salad he has had in ages! He could have just had 3 servings of that!  BUT...of course....we had a main course, and we both had the pork porchetta with kraut and mustard and cream potatoes. The pork was absolutely melt in your mouth and the tangy kraut and potatoes were just the right accompaniment.  The portions are extremely generous....I took home half of my entree. We had a lovely and delicious leisurely dinner...not leaving until after 9:15, and the entire time, there was not an empty table in the place. This is NOT a romantic hot spot...it is loud and active, but the food is wonderful and the staff is great.  Both our server and the hostess thanked us for coming out for restaurant week and trying P&P. No worries...we will be back!

P &P's Easter brunch...in a word: Awesome! Fabulous spread with biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, baked items and salmon with capers. My favorite was the goat cheese focaccia. Plus you could order from the menu their signature P&P Benedict, a non meat Benedict, farmers omelet or waffles. And of course their famous $5 mimosas and bloody Mary's along with a fabulous list of craft beers. And...wait for it...the price? Just $25 per person! So the brunch for 2, 2 bloody Mary's and 2 craft beers plus generous tip: only $90!
