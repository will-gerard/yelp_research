Went to Majerle's for Trivia on Tuesday.. Its c ool because all the questions come up on the screens, but was too loud from the background music and random customers to focus on the questions. Food is good, and the 2 for 1 beer special is pretty awesome.  rated the place for being good, but not my first choice.

My friends & I have talked about going here for weeks especially since we live down the street.. They literally have 4 meal options.. Burger and 3 dif tacos (shortrib,chicken,vegi). On a wednesday around dinner time they were out of the short rib taco.. So I was stuck with chicken, cause no vegetarian taco is worth 3 dollars..  Super slow even with 6 people working and they were more interested in goofing around like high school gym class.   **Here is a suggestion, so if you are out of short ribs or chicken why not have other options like ground beef or steak.. Problem Solved!!  Obviously there is no chef/cook  to make such as easy suggestion!

I was mad when I wrote my first review.. Burgers are really good, especially if you add bacon and guacamole. Fries I would compare to In&out, fresh cut. I personally like crispy.. But still a go to place for an awesome burger!
