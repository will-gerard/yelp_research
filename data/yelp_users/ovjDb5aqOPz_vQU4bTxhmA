I had a whole review written and then IE crashed and I lost it but essentially, here's the gist:  Don't go to this joint. It used to be decent to good..more towards the good. Now you bring your car in dirty and it leaves dirtier after they've used dirty, damp towels to swish the dirt around.  Save your money,. I'm not sure where to go unfortunately because I can't seem to find ANY decent car wash in the valley anymore, but I can tell you not to bother with any of the Danny's car washes in the valley.

Four months ago I brought my car to Fletcher's to have the brakes and rotors repaired. At that time they told me I needed the calipers replaced as well. Unfortunately, I was looking at an $800+ repair bill and really couldn't afford to have the calipers done. They did what they needed to do in the hopes I'd just waited too long to have my brakes replaced and sent me on my way. I should mention that the shop manager let me use his personal vehicle while my car was being worked on!   Now, here it is April and my brakes have started making a really ugly noise again. Time to get those calipers done and thankfully, I can afford it now! So, I bring the Honda back in for the much needed attention. I was quoted $215 for both calipers total plus $100 in labor. Rotors are fine this time around!  I also needed an oil change. I made a joke about throwing it in for free and much to my amazement the manager said, "You know, I can do that for you. Absolutely."  That service is precisely why I bring my vehicles to Fletcher's and send my friends to them as well. In this day and age of service providers ripping their customers off to make a buck and giving crummy service, it's incredibly nice to know I have a phenomenal place to take my car when she's sick...where we'll BOTH get good service!  Thanks, Fletcher's!

Tried The Prime tonight because I've read so many good things about this restaurant. I gave up on getting good Chinese in the valley several years ago because, well, you just can't find it. However, the Prime is pretty darn good.   I ordered the Beef with Broccoli and it was absolutely amazing. In fact, it is likely the most flavorful I've ever had. The broccoli was cooked to perfection, the flavor was exactly right and the beef was tender and tasty. However, the rice was over-cooked and gooey and I didn't care for the texture at all...but I rarely desire rice so this wasn't a big deal.  The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because I ordered the egg drop soup and it was NOT what others have hyped it to be. It really didn't taste at all like egg drop soup..probably because it is just too busy. 9.5 years later I'm still in search of good egg drop soup in this city and I think I've given up. This looks like some sort of gravy..I'd liken it to the color of hot and sour soup, actually. There are vegetables in it..which I don't want in my egg drop soup.   Other than the egg drop, I will definitely try this place again in 8-12 months when I next crave some Chinese food.

I have been coming to Ahwatukee Nail Spa for a good year and a half or two to get my brows waxed. Amy is absolutely amazing. Every time I come in, the woman up front (I assume the owner?) asks me why I don't get pedicures or fills there. I tell her I have somewhere else I go for those services. I haven't ever told her why. Hopefully she reads her Yelp reviews!  Today my car is a Fletcher's getting some work done. Since Ahwatukee Nail Spa is in walking distance to both my house and Fletcher's and since I needed a fill, pedicure and waxing I thought I'd give Ahwatukee Nail Spa another chance.  What a disappointment!  The pedicure is lackluster. The gentleman completing this service had a decent enough disposition but it didn't seem like he cared a whole lot about what I was asking. This is the primary reason I stopped coming here for these services almost two years ago. I told him I have extra skin buildup on my big toes from wearing heels every day. Ask him if he'll take care of it. He says yes however, he doesn't. The massage was hilarious. There was no massage to it. It was literally copious amounts of lotion into my calves and feet. He painted my toenails and off to the fill in we went.   At the start of the fill, I asked him to please plan to put acrylic all the way to the tip to reinforce it because the acrylics are starting to break. He then informs me that they only fill the area at the top where the nail has grown out...I'm aware of what a fill is. Much to my chagrin I've had acrylics since 1996!! At this point I said, "You know, the woman up front asks me every time I get my eyebrows waxed why I don't get fills or pedicures here and this is a perfect example of why not. You don't tell a customer no on a request like this. You also don't school them on what a back fill is. You simply do what the customer asks and if you want to charge me extra, then fine." He laughed. No kidding, full on laughed.   So, at the end of the fill he asked to see my feet. Turns out he hadn't put the top coat on. So, he does this but does it in a way where you can see he's all over the place and there is top coat on my toes.   I will stick to AZ Tip -n- Toes where my business is appreciated, I'm respected as a customer and my pedicures and fills result in satisfaction!   Never again Ahwatukee Nail Spa. Never again.
