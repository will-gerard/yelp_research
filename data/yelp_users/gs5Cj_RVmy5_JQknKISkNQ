my wife and I went to see Sex and the Second City.  What a hilarious play!  We had a great time, everyone at the theater was very friendly and it was a great experience.

Very good food...service was a little slow, but not too bad.

I couldn't tell u if this company knows how to do their job, and the reason being he never called me back.  My key broke off in my ignition in an older vehicle so I called them to see if they could help and when I called I got a voice mail so I left a message.  He called me back in a few minutes and I explained my situation to which he said he would need to do some research and will call me back in a few minutes.  A couple hours later I hadn't heard back so I called, again got voice mail, and left a message.  Never heard from him again.  I guess business is so good that one customer just doesn't matter.  Sad really.

I just got my 1968 VW bus windows tinted by Dave and I will say they look great and I couldn't be happier.  This is the second time I have done business with Dave and I highly recommend him.  He does great work!
