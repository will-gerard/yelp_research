Food here is delicious.  Make sure you try the egg salad sandwich and vegetarian pizza!  Service is sketchy sometimes but otherwise worth the wait.

Avoid this place like the plague!  Horrible service, mediocre food, terrible management.  Took 4 hours to eat, and the experience was less than memorable.

A must stop in the Phoenix area.  Sunday brunch here doesn't get much better.  Everything here is fantastic!

Sometimes the service here can be lethargic but the food makes up for it.  Make sure to try the Brie and Turkey sandwich.  Also great specials on beer!

Owner gave my bagel to his buddy who was two people behind me and then gave me the wrong bagel.  Good first impression

Over served a belligerent customer at the bar who fell over in his bar stool hitting our table and spilling wine all over us.  Manager told us the patron was "done" instead he got the guy another drink.  Meanwhile our bottle of wine was wasted and shirt was ruined.   Service of the year award...

FINALLY, good food makes it out to Chandler.  Chop Shop is awesome.  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  Make sure you check out the Kale Cleanse, iced tea, an BBQ salad (veggies, sub tofu or avocado).

Finally a gluten friendly restaurant.  Pleasant staff and nice atmosphere.  Check out the harvest sandwich or the half and half deals.

Awesome Mexican food.  It was open for 40 years before the landlord made them move and now they are finally back.  Check out the breakfast burrito with potato.  Doesn't get much better.  Not as fast as other Mexican places but it's easily worth the wait.

Can't recommend enough. All too often auto shops are filled with sketchy people who take advantage of their customers.  Elevens has always treated me fairly with the highest quality product available.  They communicate well with project budgets and timelines.  Go check them out.
