I have been to Millennium nails several times.  I wasn't a huge fan of their location in the mall when they were doing renovations, but they have opened their new location by Macy's and it's very nice.  I had a very friendly guy who put gel on my nails and did a great job waxing my eyebrows.  He was friendly, fast and my nails still look great after two weeks.  The prices were great too...I'll definitely go back anytime I stop by Champaign.

I am really shocked at all of the decent reviews for this place.  The only reason I am giving it one star is because the service was fast and friendly.  I ordered the Seafood Bento box and my husband got the chicken teriyaki and a beef bowl.   Midway through, we discussed going through the Wendy's drive through.  It just seemed like the lowest quality of everything was used- gross rice, fish with a weird texture, even the chicken seemed of a lower quality then you get at the Asian food places in the mall.  Tokyo Express actually was recommended to us, unfortunately, we wish we would have stayed home and cooked.  I would not recommend.

I wasn't thrilled with my meal here--but the drinks are great and the banana dessert was amazing as well.  Best to go here if you're into authentic Mexican dishes as opposed to fresh tex mex.

Thank you to Dr. Barrett and to the entire staff of Eye Care for Animals for saving my dog's eye after an ulcer.  The receptionist, and all of the nurses were BEYOND extraordinary and I truly felt that they cared about my pup.  I never had to wait in the waiting room or in the exam room more than about 7 minutes, which is very appreciated due to my hectic work schedule.  After about a month of healing after surgery, my dog's eyesight has returned and his last stitch was removed today!!    I will never be able to thank this office enough and would recommend them for any eye care needs your pet may have.  They were amazing on all levels- primarily customer service, and quality.  Bravo for this facility.

I recently held my little sister's bridal shower at Kennedy's as it was her favorite restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area.  Everything was perfect!  We were there for a while (opening presents etc) and both hosts were very attentive to my needs and went above and beyond to make sure I was stress free for the shower.  The food spread was beautiful, we had a perfect amount, everything tasted amazing and everyone was impressed!  As the shower was concluding, we walked out on the patio behind the restaurant and had some wine...it overlooked the golf course and was a gorgeous scene for family pictures.  I was also recently attending a conference at the I hotel but wanted to go some place that was nice for lunch with several of my colleagues...so we headed down the road to Kennedy's.  I had the mushroom explosion soup-- hands down the best soup I've ever had.  I also had one of their fresh seasonal salads (I had one with strawberries and goat cheese).   My friend had a sandwich and the other had a salad and mushroom explosion soup as well.  Both were very impressed with the service, food quality, and the price for lunch was an AMAZING deal for the quality we received.  I will plan on returning to Kennedy's for special occasions and anytime that I am ever in town on business.

I located Get Your Move On on Yelp.  I was determined to use a reputable moving company after our previous moving company damaged over $7,000.00 worth of our belongings.  I actually told the first person I contacted at Get Your Move on about my paranoia due to our previous move.  He assured me they would take great care of us and that we would have a positive experience.  Still skeptical, I had one of the guys come out and meet with my husband beforehand to give us an estimate and we booked them for our move.  The day of the move, I of course did not have everything packed.  The guys came in, all introduced themselves to me and shook my hand and packed up the rest of my stuff in less than an hour (I should have just had them pack up all of the stuff, they were so fast and efficient!)  The move was probably the fastest I've ever experienced, and they wrapped up all of my furniture to ensure it was not damaged.  I seriously don't think any of the guys even took a break until the truck was fully loaded.  You know how many moving companies claim that you can just sit back and let them do all the work?  That has never been the case for me, but these guys were so fast, my husband and I literally sat on the balcony and had a drink while they did their thing.  The unload went just as well.  I told the owner of the company that I have never had such a great experience with movers.  We will continue to use Get Your Move on anytime we move and tell all of our friends, because trust me-- if you choose the wrong moving company, things can be very bad.  Thank you YELPERS for the reviews that helped me to find Get Your Move on and protect our belongings.

Beer flights and food were amazing here!!  We had a very cool server and the atmosphere makes you want to stay and drink several beer flights!  Best BBQ in Chambana!

We recently moved and needed to find a new vet for my little shitzu Shugz.  Finding a place that he likes and feels comfortable at is VERY important to me.  Due to the good Yelp reviews, I decided this would be my first "try" at finding a good match for a Vet in our area.  I was able to get in quickly, and on a Saturday.  The receptionist was extremely kind and helpful.  We did not wait at all, and the original nurse that helped us clearly cared very much for my dog-- you could just tell she was an absolute animal lover.    The doctor came in right after the nurse, Dr. Berthiaume.  He was FANTASTIC.  Friendly, helpful, and went over what he would recommend, and what we could hold off on, and a long term plan for my dog.  The entire staff told me costs up front, so there were no surprises, and absolutely NO pressure to have unnecessary work done, as we've experienced at other clinics.  Our check out was prompt, the price was exactly as I had expected, and I got a discount (without asking) for being a first time customer.  Later that week, I got a call notifying me that my dog's heartworm test was negative.  I am extremely impressed at the cleanliness, friendliness of the staff, knowledge of the Dr. and just overall WOW factor of this Veterinary Clinic and I'm so thankful we struck gold on our first choice.  The other thing is, they had a card displayed from the place that we had just taken our dog to get groomed that he LOVED - I guess good places come in pairs.  Yelp reviewers are dead on here - this clinic is superior and I look forward to a long relationship with Topaz keeping my boy Shugz happy and healthy!

Huge fan of this place!  My fiance and I made last minute reservations here on Christmas Eve...we had a GREAT waitress, can't remember her name...who understood we wanted to move quick so we could catch Mission Impossible (which would only get about 2 stars, by the way).  We ordered the flat bread (I'm obsessed with truffle oil), one of their specialty pizzas and a Greek salad to share.  We were impressed with ALL of it.  Flat bread was good if you're in the mood for starchy foods--the pizza had a very thin crust, which I loved, so you could eat more of the toppings...and the salad was HUGE for its small price.  We tasted several of the beers and ended up getting a growler to go because we loved it so much.  Decor was a bit industrial, and very contemporary, especially for the Midwest.  We will definitely return and bring friends!

I really wanted to like these cupcakes, but maybe I've just been spoiled by Chicago cupcakes.  I thought the actual cupcake was just so so but I prefer mine much more moist-- and the frosting was too hard and sugary- not really creamy like I prefer.  My husband liked them, he'd probably give them a 4, but I will not return.

After being stood up twice by a garage door company that I had been introduced to at a home show, I looked on yelp and gave Triple B a call.  They came out the next day and we placed an order for a new garage door motor and garage door.  Roderick was extremely friendly and professional and offered his opinion without being pushy.  We were pleased with the price, and the garage door arrived early.  I believe the owner's name was Rusty - he came to personally install our door and motor, carried the old one away and it was better than we had even expected!  We also got a referral for an excellent painter from them who ended up painting our entire house.  We will use Triple B Garage doors for any gating or garage needs we have in Arizona from here on out.  Highly recommend them!

I called Shaun at Mr. Clean Carpet Care on a Thursday after my cat had an accident in the closet on our fairly new carpet.  He sent out a truck the next morning (Friday) at 8am to accommodate my schedule.  Michael, the technician, arrived on time and was very friendly.  (He was also really good with my little dog that was very curious and probably getting in his way!)  In an hour, he had set up and cleaned the carpet in the closet, the hallway around the closet, and our nursery and literally removed every single spot.  He let me know when he was done and was packed up and out the door with a smile.  I will be using Mr. Clean Carpet Care again in the near future as we are remodeling and I'm planning to clean all of the light beige carpets in our home.  Shaun followed up with me right after the appointment to make sure I was happy with the experience.  Thanks guys for doing such a great job in a short time period and for providing such outstanding, friendly customer service!  Yelp once again provided me with a great business connection.

I am actually quite shocked at all of the five star reviews.  Although our service was outstanding, the food was just not good and there is also no alcohol, although the server did tell us this as we accidently ordered virgin margaritas.  Food was dry, seasoning was sub par and the meat quality we experienced was questionable.  Perhaps we visited on an off day, but we won't return.

As I was sitting in the pedicure chair last night, I thought to myself - I'm really doing a disservice to an amazing place by not writing Polish Me Pretty Nail Bar a review.  They always fit me in, and I'm always in a rush, so they'll do my manicure and pedicure at the same time.  I used to go across the street, and it was much more expensive and not as clean.  Polish Me Pretty is SO clean - the owner is literally there cleaning things every time I am there.  Not to mention, the fabulous deal I get.  An express pedi and mani for $31.  Every nail technician I've had there has been fabulous and I'm just so happy I've found my go-to nail place!  Thank goodness I gave Polish Me Pretty a try- they have never disappointed.

This is our favorite pizza in Arizona.  The atmosphere was great, my wine was yummy, service was great, and the pizza was fresh and tasty.  We can't wait to bring our family here when they visit- plus it's walking distance from home, so we can drink all the wine we want!  Bravo to Classic Italian Pizza!
