This was cool. Not only was it free but it was adults only!!  Yes!! It was part of the first Friday that goes on downtown. If you go, 2.5hrs isn't enough time to see everything. There was 20mins left before closing and I didn't get to see the Gross exhibit that you had to pay $5-8? to see. Eghh!! It was upstairs at the very end. If I had new that, I would've started there and worked my way down.  I love all the interactive things they have. The drum that bangs from your pulse rate it receives from your palm of your hand is awesome. Watching the wheelchair race was funny. Things that "sneeze" at you when you lift the flap. Walking through the stomach, over the "hairs" from our ears.  Man! So much to read, see, experience! Fun for groups, and those like me who prefer their own company.   Friends took their kids to the following weeks, Fry's Free day. From what I was told, it was a zoo. Little kids trampled, so many people! I'm happy they had a kid free zone. So us big kids can get in on the fun stuff they have to offer.

Ive been practicing here since September 2011, never having done Bikram or any yoga, I instantly fell in love with it! The smell you have to get used to but you have to understand people are sweating none stop.  The teachers are all nice and helpful. Even the students are so welcoming! When I thought yoga, I thought skinny snotty rich people. With the exception of 1 or 2, that is not the case here! Its very diverse. And that's what kept me going, I feel comfortable walking around in yoga gear. That's saying something especially from a big girl.  Brooke the owner is an awesome person and someone to have in your life, even if its just a small part.

I've been a fan of this place for a few years now. Its to the point when someone from work brings it for lunch, I can tell just from the salsa smell they went to Juans. LoL. The chips and salsa are always a listed item when we order to go from here, for about $1.30, you get a small (which isn't small) bag of chips and salsa. Always ask for extra salsa.  The shredded beef or chicken hard tacos are always fantastic, the fluatas (rolled tacos) are good here as well. You can get them in a combo with rice and beans at a very reasonable price $7.00-$8.00.  When you're sick? Go for the albondigas soup (meatball rice soup). It is soooo good and soothing to aching throats and it just makes me feel better when I'm under the weather. The broth is light but flavorful, with rice on the side, you can add or leave. It comes with flour or corn tortilla.  The have red and green chili corn tamales. Both are fantastic but I go for the green chili corn, extra sauce $2.00.  The service is always nice and professional when we stay in. They're quick to ask if we want a refil on soda, chips, salsa - check back a couple times to make sure you have everything you could want. Sometimes we'll call our order in and decide to sit and eat instead of coming right back to work. Their so easy about letting us do so. When dining in, I get my order quickly. If we're calling in for lunch, we call about 1035AM, since our lunch is at 11AM and before their rush hour begins. So in all, there hasn't been a problem with getting out food.  When you first walk in for lunch, the sitting area looks small. But when it gets busy, they open the back area which has quite a few more booths back there. They have a flat screen going in the corner and also "bar" seating. The only thing that bothered me about this place is the Specials board is always under the t.v. at the far end of the dining area. You'll see it if you happen to go to the bathroom or know to look over there.  Oh yea, a large drink is extra large and medium is large. Sometimes I forget and have this delicious but HUGE Horchata, because I said large. This includes both the to go and dine in cup.

The service for takeout have been excellent. If a waiter/waitress happens to be standing there, both times, they just said okay, looked at the takeout person and walked off. Very abrupt.   Two things I actually liked. The double shrimp crunchy roll. Standard roll I can get anywhere. This strawberry cheesecake that was more like a mousse filling than cheesecake.  Items I've tried and didn't care for: Orange Roughy with Orange Sauce, the fish was delicious, but the pile of rice I can only eat with the some of the orange sauce on it. The side salad that came with it was wilted and boring. Tan Tan-Me, this was okay. I felt like I was eating a spicy spaghetti soup. Not exactly what I was looking for. Korean Spicy Beef Asian Noodles, the beef was okay...no spice to it...the noodles where okay. The meal just looked thrown together and not appealing to the eye.  I don't think I'll be back...maybe for the dessert counter. I saw some other treats I wouldn't mind grabbing to go.

I really like this place. It has all the knick knacks and other interesting finds. I've been coming here for almost 6 years off and on and it's always the same. They have so much to look at, I go here for the incense. Sometimes I grab so oil since there a bit cheaper here. They always greet you when you come in and have some palm/tarot or whatever reader on duty. I guess its seperate but there is also a tiny bookstore inside. Once in awhile I'm in and out but with all the things they have you can't help but browse it all.

I brought my iced coffee here for an exchange because it tasted bad. Sofia did everything she could to get it right. She made a new one, that didn't work, she offered to put more caramel. That didn't work, she offered a different kind. That didn't work. But the entire time, she didn't give me attitude or get annoyed with me because she had to keep remaking it. She even apoloigized. Hell it could've been me, but she said, it could be we need to remake the coffee.  She was very helpful - Thank you!

Coffee I can get the same at the canteen here at work.  The eyebrow raise at me when my drink was ready wasn't the "customer service" I expected from someone I didn't know. It would've been perfect if his pinkie was raised as he handed it to me.  Decor was interesting but not somewhere I would go back to unless I was desperate or forgot I had been here before.

When I walked in it took a few minutes to be greeted, once I was approached I got the up/down look. It made me feel like this was an upscale restaurant but didn't look it. But having just got out if the shower and wearing flip flops, it doesn't surprise me.  The lady was efficient and helpful when I couldn't remember the name. I got the Pad Thai and Hot/Sour soup as mentioned here.  It didn't take long to get my food. The decor was nice and it looked clean. The man who gave me my order was nice, he greeted a lady who was sitting near me familiarly.  The Pad Thai was delicious and a huge serving 3 days of dinner for me. Just spicy enough and the rice seemed to much along with it but it all came together.   Hot and Sour soup was great! Burnt my mouth because I was impatient to get it in my mouth. Just the broth had so much flavor.  Both dishes had huge shrimp and big chunks of chicken in the Pad Thai.   Maybe a few more chunks will make it better and being there the first time with the up/down look made me feel awkward. Lol  But I'll go back.

Jumbo shrimp are always my go to. The now have fish taco's. Unfortunantly, you can't order just ONE fish taco to try it out. You have to order the freaking combo! That is pretty dumb IMO, what if I don't like it? What if I start to resent the place because I by passed my always delicious jumbo shrimp? So, I skipped the fish taco and ordered my usual.  I like to get the ranch and louisana hot sauce and mix them together. Dipping heaven. They offer coctail sauce and tarter sauce as well. There is so many choices on what plate you can get, fish and jumbo shrimp combinations. Or just fish or just jumbo shrimp. The fried zuchinni is also good.  For the smallest combo it's about 8 bucks, drink is seperate. So it's not to bad in the price.

What I liked: The bed was super comfortable! I can't sleep hot, so I got to adjust the temparture to super cold, too cold-my dad was pissed LOL. The pool had complimentry towels on each lounge chairs. The showers got super hot. (I sleep cold, but take hot showers - go figure) The french fries from the cafe. They had a Starbucks in the Lobby. The days newspaper was placed outside our door. Overall, the employees there were super nice. Wished a good morning/day from everyone I passed.  What I didn't like: The cafe in the casino was super disappointing! My dad ordered the meatloaf no gravy. I got the open turkey sandwhich. The waiter ASSUMED I wanted my dad's gravy. He mentioned it, I looked at him and said No, I guess I'll just scrap off the gravy - which I did. His face fell, but hey, don't assume what I want. How he does it in Hawaii doesn't mean I wanted it that way. The Iced Tea I ordered had been sitting there all day. I can tell when it's sitting past the 4 hour mark, I asked for no lemon and recieved it with a lemon sitting in it. After tasting it, I handed it back and asked for a Sprite. Our mashed potatoes were grey. The place was kept so cold, that after 10mins. the vegetables were cold. Not cool, COLD. It wasn't just the casino, the hallways were freezing. My dad was upset they didn't offer coffee in the room. You have to pay for internet, 20 bucks for 24hours. (When visiting a family member in the hospital, I recieved a free voucher good for 14days)  What was wierd: Friday I decided to go to the pool in the morning, two cleaning ladies were in the hallway cleaning rooms. A few hours later me and dad went to the hospital and when we came back that evening, the room had been cleaned and restocked. How do they know? Is there cameras in the hallways??  Checking in Thursday night and leaving Saturday late morning cost: $113.00 - not bad, but we decided that we won't be going back. We used a friends member card, I also mentioned my dad's a Vet and I work for the Government. Which could have accounted for the low cost.

I was on the hunt for a sit down Mexican restaruant on my way home. I couple places I passed because the parking lot was filled and I was by myself and needed quiet.  I pulled in to this tiny parking lot and was relieved to see only a few cars. I walked in and I stood there for a second when First waitress told me to sit anywhere. So I walked in and grabbed a booth. First waitress took my drink order: Horchata and a water. Second waitress came up handing me a menu and asking for my drink order. I told her First already took it.  A few minutes later Second came back with chips, two different salsa's and a glass of water. I gave her my order: Friday Special Albondigas soup with flour tortilla and a side of refried beans. She walked away and a minute later returned to ask me again if I wanted flour or corn tortilla.  Well I waited for my dinner, I dived into the chips and salsa. First issue, the salsa are in SQUEEZE BOTTLES. Really!?!? How am I going to dip my chip in this?? On this small PLATE?! Annoyed. Needless to say I made a mess but I enjoyed them. The green salsa was nice and spicy. The red had that "burnt" taste. I don't know how to describe it, its not actually burnt ...maybe a mole type taste. But both were delicious regardless, even if it wasn't chunky salsa.  My soup arrived in a HUGE bowl with 4 HUGE meatballs. Chunks of tomato, bell pepper and onions. You can taste the tomato sauce and was very flavorful and came with a side of rice. My beans were in a large dish and the tortilla was nice and hot. The soup was sooo delicious I'm still thinking about it today!! The rice though was a bit disappointing, there was chunks in it like it had been sitting all day. The beans I had to scrap the cheese to the side but they were about average but perfect couple with the chip and salsa.  During my meal I realized First waitress never brought me my drinks. But Second waitress was very attentive and when she checked on me I asked for my Horchata.  It was a cute little restaurant, the booths backs are very tall for privacy and the margarita's must have been good because every 5mins I heard the blender go off. With the exception of First waitress, the service was excellent, Second had stopped by making sure I had everything I needed several times. Everything together cost $13.07! Very inexpensive for a delicious huge meal.  I will be back.

First thought walking inside the store, eck. No order or just kinda slapped together product on top of shelves. I make my way towards the produce. Very limited options. But a bushel of Basil under 2 bucks? I'm in!  I proceed to walk up and down the asiles looking for dried kelp and red miso. No luck. So finally I just ask the cashier. The woman didn't speak much english but the young man jumped in to help. He was SUPER nice, walking up and down trying to help find what I'm looking for my items. He even asked the Manager when I thought red miso was a type of sauce not a packet of soup that he gave me. He also looked up the difference between kelp and seaweed. Because they had dried seaweed but not kelp. Which I ended up purchasing since it was in the same family.  The reason they got such a low star count is because, at one aisle smelled like fish juice. Very disgusting. The store was old and looked it, not very well kept. I would hesitate to purchase any frozen items here. At the other end, opposite of the produce, was a type of kitchen. It had a hot plate buffet thing going that had two different pieces of meat sweltering under the hot lamp. There was these rolled up questionable food item and pre packeged corn on a table that flies were buzzing around. Something that would get an F if an inspection should happen by. The prices were cheap but the product in certain areas is questionable. But customer service was most excellent!

I asked the lady which is better the Korean BBQ chicken or the Chili something chicken. She replied, both are spicy. Than after a few seconds, she told me the BBQ was better. So thats what I went with.  While waiting for the bathroom to open up, an employee walked out WITH HER APRON ON!! Your really going to go inside where poopticles are floating about and than walk back to the kitchen?!?! My first job was at a fast food place - I lasted 6 years up to management and I would get after any employee I caught doing that. Its disgusting! Might as well not wash your hands. Thats how bad it was to me. Thankfully she stood off to the side looking at some folder and wasn't handling my food.  When the food came, NO SPICE AT ALL!! They had a little shaker up front with chili powder, I made use of it. I got up again to use the salt and pepper mix and sauce, it was so plain. There was wayyyy to much rice for that amount of toppings.  The decor is dated and ugly. Yellow and red.  First and last time I'll be going to here.

For awhile, this place was a pain in the ass to find only because I'm coming from the North. So jumping on the freeway, figuring out when to make your U turn and than making a quick right hoping no one was coming from the access way... But than, after awhile I stopped using the freeway all together and started taking 19th ave and using the back streets to get there. Easy peesy.  The interview is quick and easy, especially when you know the answers are always no. In other words, I'm boring and nothing ever changes in my life. No trips outside country, tattoos or piercings. LoL. The moment of truth for me is the Iron test. I never get away with one finger prick, we have to do both hands to try and get a 12.5 or higher. .  I'm a very difficult stick. If using a Butterfly needle, it would be no problem...for the most part. But since its a lot of blood and the bigger needle, I know to tell the tech that I'm a difficult prick and give me an experienced techie. At this location, that would be Rudy! I always, always, always ask for him. Otherwise I'm a pin cushion. Rudy is like a conductor of the blood business. Its entertaining to watch, and with one go he sticks me and the blood flows.  The place is always clean, popcorn, goodies and magazines for you. A place I prefer to donate than the UBS that comes to my workplace.  I forgot to mention, I always misplace the paper that tells me when I'm eligible to come back in...or I'll pin it up and never look at it...I'll get a reminder email when its times. I just log on to the website, choose the location and pick the time. So easy!

The lady who took my order was not just quiet but a bit difficult to understand. Maybe just raising her voice would have helped. She was very nice in explaining the menu, but I had to lean over the counter to catch the words she pretty much whispered.  What I ordered: Twice Fried Shrimp with Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Soup.  Twice Fried Shrimp - the sauce was good, but I had ended up scraping off the batter from the shrmip. Dipping the shrimp into the sauce, making it a whole lot better. The fried rice was good, typical of any fast food chinese place.  Sweet and Sour Soup - it looked like brown gelatin. Gross. I took one bite and thought, no it couldn't taste that bad. So I took a second bite, yup - it is bad. It had a strange after taste.  Soda - I saw the fountain drink station so I ordered a soda. Well, needless to say she proceeded to pull a 2 liter from a refrigerator and poured my drink from that into a to go cup.  I won't be going back.

Ladies, looking for eye candy? Well, stop by lol, cute guys employed here. Guys, you won't be left out because there were a couple cute women there too.  Anywho, first there's a lot of passing through traffic. While browsing, different sets of people were constantly coming and going. I even heard the employees address a couple by name, a good sign of good customer service.  It's a decent sized store with high ceilings. Which they made great use of the space. Records lined the walls. The other side was a drum set up on this high ledge.   I went in looking specifically for a cheap DVD player and speakers. The first speaker I chose, I caught the eye of one of the ladies there. Long brown hair, glasses, librarian sexy ;). She helped me understand that what I wanted to use the speaker for wasn't what I needed. After browsing some more, I finally just asked if she could help me. She quickly walked through what was there and found this cool Sony radio for 10 bucks! When I wondered aloud if it didn't work, could I bring it back. She offered to hook it up to my phone and tested it out before I paid for it. Super helpful!  I also found a DVD player for 15 bucks. And two DVD's for 2 bucks each. It all cost me less than buying a new DVD player at the box stores.... And I've looked there first!  There was instruments, beats headphones and a decent collection of Xbox games. Typical pawn shop wares, a place I would check out again when I don't want to fork over a lot of money. :)

A good place to get a pedicure, $16! They play one tv w/ Netflix and a smaller tv w/ local channels. The chairs are a bit run done & its a bit narrow. But the people there are ALWAYS nice and speak English...w/ the exception of 1 or 2, the older ones.   Ask for Angie or Tuna!

When I first walked in I was greeted by two older women, they were listening to some old time music, like from a record. And it was cute because I barely could see one over the books. The other woman offered to help me find anything, but I just wanted to browse.  THERE ARE SO MANY BOOKS! Rows and rows of books, the shelves looked like my home, double rows on shelves because there was just to many. Books in the back area that I peeked in, books in boxes still waiting to be put up.  This would be my ideal Heaven. All my favorite books and than some and old time music in the background while I browse/read. The only thing it was missing was comfortable seating areas. Were there some? Not sure as I haven't completely looked through the entire store, just my sections. The book shelves are high and some times I worry that it'll topple over me. So if your claustrophobic, I don't know how comfortable you'll be in the aisles.  $4.00 is the most I've spent for a book here. The paperback selection is huge! Which I love because my fingers tingle when holding a hardback for a few minutes.  From the outside, the store looked small, but inside they made it work with such a wide selection. I've been back a couple times since my initial visit. And most likely will be back today. Yes I am that much of a bookworm. It is a used bookstore, so it has that used look to it, the carpet is thin, a certian smell to it. But it doesn't take away because I can find so much.

When I walked in, I was pleasently surprised by the decor. It was filled with Oriental decorations, plants, etc. It wasn't sparsely decorated either. I pretty much sat there looking around at all the pictures, swords, blinds, etc. I was greeted by a woman dressed in a giesha outfit. It was really nice until I noted she was wearing Puma socks with her flip flops. But points for an almost complete outfit.  If your alone, I suggest just sitting at the bar. Happy Hour is all day so your handed a sheet that you mark the quantity next to what  they have on the list. You also got a menu for the rolls (not happy hour) and a regular quantity sheet. So three things are given to you and boy was I not only nervouse but confused!   I ordered off menu, the Arizona roll. For $9.95 and about 10 pieces, I feel it was worth it. I also ordered the Hand Roll: Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tuna and California. The hand rolls are bigger than what I orginially thought so it was a lot of food. They were all delicious but the Shrimp Tuna hand roll was my favorite.  The waitress was nice even if she didn't really explain what to do. But thats forgiven as I'm the type to speak up and ask questions. In all, it was a nice visit and a place I will definently be back.  It looks kinda sketchy next to a Liquor store and dealing with all the light rail constructions plus the nieghborhood isn't the greatest. But its blocks from where I live so I'll def be back.

I've seen this place all the time but never went because I knew of other Mexican restaurants that I know are good. But my dad has been eyeing it and since he's paying he decided where to go.  First we stood at the front for 5 minutes waited to be seated. 1 waitress was delivering drinks to a nearby table, glanced at us, and kept on going. No greeting, No be right there, completely ignored. So we got to eye the diners food who were seated near by while we waited.  Finally we were seated. Another 10mins role by, passed by several waitress until our drinks we're taken. I told the lady we were ready to order and she said okay...and walked away. Really?!  I ordered an Horchata and a black coffee. I got a very thin milky horchata and coffee with cream on the side. Another waitress came and took our order. We got complimentary chips salsa and refriend beans as we waited. When our meal arrived about 15mins later, I returned my horchata because it was mostly water. After I was half way done with my meal, I finally got the water I asked for when I returned the horchata. Oh, when I returned the drink thats when she decided to tell me that the machine is down and "their working on it." If that was the case I would've ordered something else to begin with.  My meal was 2 talapia tacos, rice and beans with a ceviche tostada on the side. The fish tacos were good, not great but good - same with the beans. The tacos had a tblsp of chopped lettuce and tomato's. I didn't touch the rice. After I finished my meal I asked about my tostada because that never appeared. 5mins later it arrived. The ceviche was piled on top of the tostada, so I had to eat half of the ceviche before I can even pick up the tostada. THAT was delicious.  Dad got a side of beans, a cheese enichilada and over easy egg. First he was disappointed because he didn't get a tortilla with his meal. Each of my taco's came with 2 corn tortillas, so I handed him one of those to keep him happy while we waited for the waitress to happen by. One waitress came and he asked for a sopapilla. She said okay and another waitress came back to us asking about it. They didn't understand that all he wanted was bread to dip into is bean and egg. He even switched to Spanish in the hopes of getting a better understanding of what he wanted. It usually comes with honey and powdered sugar but he had to explain again, all he wanted was the bread. ONE. So 5mins later she came back with 4.   He didn't care for his meal. The refried beans weren't the greatest, the cheese enchilada was made from the can and the egg had too much yolk for his liking. He barely touched it. He did eat some of my rice I didn't want.  All in all, it won't be some place I would be returning. When I crave Mexican seafood, I'll go to Marisco's.  The one good thing, it looks really small from the outside - but it's nice and big inside.

Honey Hot Wings are the best here! The Honey BBQ are good too. I have yet to try the others, for some reason I always choose the Honey Hot, they are that addictive. The burgers are awesome, I can never remember the name of the one I get, I just look for the one that has guacamole in it and especially like the stuffed mushrooms! Service is always decent, the older Caucasian woman (I've recently learned her name is Judie) is especially nice, you can hear the smile in her voice at drive thru. Working six years at fast food, smiling while talking makes a big difference.

I called at 10am to see if they had the 250ct plastic eggs. The lady told me, "Yes, we have 9." So I said GREAT! Hold 4 for me, I get off at 230 I'll pick them up after. At 220 I called again and asked Mason if my eggs where still on hold. I was told yes.  Than I got there.  They had the 60ct plastic eggs waiting for me. Egh!!! Are you freaking kidding me?!? The lady was nice enough to call the Paradise Valley store and they had 2, and they put it aside for me.  Thankfully that store not only had 2 but 1 more, so I bought all 3.   I'm annoyed at this store because I specifically asked for what I needed and made sure they still had it before making the trip. The hassle could have been avoided.

This place has been here for years and always enjoy their food.  For some reason I only go once a year but the food never changes! To me, this is chinese food. When you pull up it looks small, but when you walk inside you realize how far back it goes.  I ordered the #13 Spicy Orange Chicken. Its a large portion served with a heaping mound of white rice(it could be brown rice but I think its white with soy sauce), a decent sized egg roll and 2 of those chip things stuck on top. If your eating in, you get a small bowl of egg drop soup. This is the only thing I have issue with, its bland! Its always beautiful and the texture creamy but no spices are used. BUT just add a dash of salt and pepper and its delicious!  This place isn't packed but quite a few tables taken whenever I go in. Its good for small or large groups, they have these round tables and a turn thing...lazy suzanne? In the middle so you can turn it to the dish you want.  The service is pretty good and the restaurant is always nice and clean.

Did you know they have pizza's here?! Even better - Cinnabon! I don't have to get outta my car and walk a mile in a mall to feed my face a Cinnabon!   Score one for them!! They have the pecan and original Cinnabon. Both delicious...except when lukewarm. Seems these are best when eaten warm...and only the middle. LoL  I've had the Chicken Pesto "10 pizza - delicious!! Huge pie that can serve 2, or 1 uncomfortably. LoL I've also tried the ham and jalapeno...egh. Not as great as the other. Huge slices of ham and sliced jalapeno.   The ladies in the drive thru are always nice and for pizza's, their pretty quick to serve up. Oh and the large soda, it's huge! I'm pretty sure it's bigger than 32oz. I keep forgetting and my eyes bulge at its hugeness. Ha!

I wish there was a 2.5 stars, I don't want to give them a bad or a good rating. First, small parking lot, 2 entrances in the back, one in the front. Cool art on the out side walls.  Found an entrance, walked in and was greeted by no one. Saw several waitresses hustling about. Finally one saw me standing there and pointed across the room saying there are tables over there.  I found a long table, which all there was and sat down..... Just me. Few minutes I was finally noticed and offered a menu. As I was perusing the menu, the couple behind me got their meal. The female quickly sent hers back as there was something wrong with the taco.   The two ladies behind me were upset because they now charge for the chips and salsa. Ummm... Okay, that's why I came here. Mexican restaurant no longer giving complimentary chips and salsa?  These two tables got to talking. The couple had a different experience the other night. He thought the morning and night cooks were trained differently. Morning was given smaller portions. The two ladies were patrons of this place for years and apparently something changed within the last month.   With all that said, I decided to just walk out. Didn't even bother ordering.

First I was basically FORCED to come to this place. End of Fiscal Year luncheon that we had to pay for our own meal. And told we needed to go so it can create a team atmosphere. Yes. I know.  Problem #1 - You walk through the kitchen to get in. No hair nets. I shed like a mofo. Not sanitary for me.  Problem #2 - Its bright ass Arizona and they keep the lights to DIM and sporadically. A waiter handed me a little flashlight when I said loudly, WTH I can't see! LoL Like really, a menu is shoved in my face and my eyes aren't adjusted to the dark.  Problem #3 - We're a big group, about 25. So do they seat us where the long bench along the wall is? No. We're split up in 4 and 5 along the other side in booths.  Problem #4 - I work for the gov'ment with gov'ment pay. The cheapest item on the menu was 13.95 and there was only two different plates. And yes I got water with my meal.   I got the Chicken Salad on Crossiant bun. It was egh and the tomato's are thickly sliced. So much so that I just gave up and pulled it from the sandwhich and tossed it to the side. I do not exaggerate. A few coworkers also pulled the tomato slices from their meal. The sweet potato fries where the best part of the meal! Crinkle cut and if all I got was a big pile of these, I would've enjoyed my meal.  The special was some type of meat on a huge salad. THAT looked good! But not for $21.00!! My tablemate also got a chocolate cake at the end, $10.00!! She shared it and a we thought it was a bit on the rich side.   I felt like I was at a Casino. I don't gamble, my tribe doesn't get any money from them and I'm not lining other peoples pockets. So I hated it. No windows. No clocks. A coworker said it was more like a horror movie. LoL Which sucked since we were in the back and no exit near us.  I was told the bathroom's were very small. Thank goodness I decided to hold my pee, because I already hit my quota for small bathrooms that week and banged my head. LoL  It seems I have NOTHING good to say about this place!!! But there is: the servers were attentive for the most part. They dropped the ball a couple times but for our large group, I can understand why.  Would I go back? No. Maybe if I won the lotto....maybe...

I've been coming here for quite a few years now. And it seems I mostly get the same thing - egg rolls! These are pork egg rolls, huge and come in a four. This is one meal in itself and for just under 5 bucks, worth it! Totally different from Wahsun, just as delicious. Sometimes I also get the chicken fried rice - yum!  I like to place my order over the phone for pick up and there always so nice on the phone. The inside of the restaurant is very dark, high booths and decorative. I think the last year they got Wi-Fi, just ask for the password.  They have a little seating area if you get there before your take out is ready. Its right next to a sausage and deli place.

I walked into this place Hangry. Hungry/Angry. I was already pissed because of IKEA, and nothing sounded good but I was getting a headache because I needed something to eat.  I was quickly seated and not even a couple minutes later the waiter appeared asking what I wanted to drink. I asked for a Margarita, he can pick which one. I have no idea what it's called, it had grapefruit in it. I'm NOT a grapefruit fan, but it was DELICIOUS! And boy was it strong, half way through I could already fill it.  I got the Gyro something Pizza. It had fresh baby spinach, goat cheese, that gyro meat (lol whatever) and this italian type dressing on a flat bread pizza. It's perfect for two or if your like me, its perfect for one! LOL   The waiter was attentive and checked on me a few times. Right after I had ordered my food, I waved him over and asked if I could move. I was seated right under an air duct and I was FREEZING! He quickly reseated me on the outside patio which was perfect.  I was by myself so it felt a bit awkard because it is a perfect place for friends or a date. It was really trendy looking and a place I would be back to.

Sadly I don't have much positive to say about this place.  First Expierence: I walked in the door and was a bit confused as to where to order. Do I bypass the rail in the middle of the floor? Oh wait, there's the menu on the wall to the side. I only noticed it because I saw the to go menu first and I was reaching for that. I guess he was the Manager? He wasn't wearing all black like the others, he waited for a few minutes but I had NO CLUE what to order so I just let him wait by staying back from the counter. He didn't say anthing to me, just stood there than finally went to clean or something. When I finally decided on Dan Dan Noodles (from a review here) and 2 pork egg rolls. I felt like a robot might have been more personal than the Manager who took my order. I didn't even get a Hi. Just: For here or to go?  I got a water with my meal and it was a seperate machine. I'm saying this because it took a few minutes for my meal to arrive, and by that time I had one lonely ice in my cup. The water isn't just room temp - it was closer to warm! I filled my cup half way with ice. WTH?  The young man who brought my food was the only nice thing about the place. He smiled, told me my egg rolls will just be a minute and left.  The Food. Minced chicken basically means ground chicken. For some reason it doesn't look appetizing. On the menu it had a little red flame next to the name of the dish indicating Spicy. It barely was! Is their spicy just pepper?? Wheres the heat?! Half way through my meal I realized what the dish tasted like. A plain version of the turkey spaghetti I made a couple weeks ago. Only mine was better and it had tomato taste to it. I pushed the bowl away so disappointed. If you saw me sitting there you saw me shake my head every few minutes because it was just...blah!  I was a bit excited about the pork egg rolls, the hot mustard it was served with was a bit odd but okay, I'll try it. The first egg roll was pretty good - I've had better - the hot mustard sauce was okay. The second egg roll after about 5 minutes it was sitting in grease, I wrapped it in my napkin to sop up the grease but saw the puddle under it and said nevermind. Pushed that away.  When I only eat half the meal, and NOT take the rest home - speaks volume. When I pushed the egg roll plate away, it bumped into the bowl and realized it was PLASTIC. LoL - I thought they were nice bowls but the "clink" of them bumping I realized they look similar to the dishes you find at the dollar store.  In all, my $11.02 didn't seem worth the meal I recieved. I won't be back.

First. Theres construction EVERYWHERE. So beware! Since I live among this madness its old hat and I can navigate it no probs!  The service I get here is ALWAYS fast and courteous. They have my drink ready quickly and I go on my way.  This morning I tried the bacon,egg bagel sandwhich with tator tots. The tator tots where very delicious, flavorful - nothing I've ever had before. It wasn't plan ole tator tots, there was seasoning and I wanted more! With only SIX tator tots, am I being a glutton? SIX! lol  The sandwhich was tasty, I didn't eat it until I got to work so it was lukewarm but still good.

Walked in, cash only place. Waitress Rose? was talking to another woman, well I waited, overheard her telling customer to call before coming, her mom sometimes don't feel good so check if I'm open. They were talking like she was a regular.  Rose was eyeing me waiting for the lady to finish, I knew she was aware of me so I didn't mind the wait.  I requested the egg rolls that was raved about here. Great! 4 large for $6.50 - CASH ONLY. Worth my money, filled me with just the eggrolls.  Cabbage, mushrooms, onions, noodles, chicken and shrimp = yum!  As Rose handed me my food, she gave me a menu telling me to call in a order if I like Chinese food. I'm sure she's aware of closing at odd times even if it says open daily 10am.   I'd go back, its right by my house and only 4 stars because I haven't tried anything else but eggrolls.

Jayne  & Athena at guest service went the extra mile to get me my two free admission to the fair when i forgot to give the cashier Isaiah my card. Do I blame him for not asking first thing?  Kinda. But we were busy talking about the fair. So we're both at fault. LoL. But Guest Service fixed it easily enough and now I  can go ride the rides!

I just popped in to get a raspberry cheesecake cookie. And the entire transaction the lady engaged me in conversations. She was very pleasant. The tables looked clean and the other employee was wiping the back area down.  I love Subway and should have had dinner here instead of next door.

Yesterday I was exhausted, starving and craving tuna and bell peppers. Flipping mentally through my head I decided that getting out of my car and going in anywhere was too much effort and decided soup at home will just have to suffice.  But than I remember passing this Subway that had a drive thru! I always thought it weird because you can't point at what you want. LOL Although today it fit the bill perfectly.   I pulled up and it was an old school speaker, when greeted it pretty much squawked at me but was still understandable. It took me a couple mintues to spit out the veggies I wanted on my tuna, for some reason I kept wanting to say green broccoli! The lady was very nice and kept reasuring me she knew what I meant. I had a coupon for buy one 6", get second free so I got a spicy italian for my lunch today. She explained that the coupon required a drink. I hestitated and said sprite, because I really didn't want the soda, but she said I can substitute the bottle instead. Sweet! I can give that away easier.  When completing the transaction, the same lady greeted me warmly, asking how I was -exhausted- sympthizing with me and telling me as I left to get some rest. Very pleasant customer service.  The tuna was super good, but that could've been my hunger making the opinion. I would have perferred more tuna and less bread though. Spinach, green peppers and red onions tasted fresh and delicious!

Like any Gas Station at 530AM, its quite busy. What I like about QT is that the cashier can handle two guests at one time on each side of them.  Is it just me or the hello when you walk in the door is annoying? Circle K started doing that to. I don't mind it if I happend to walk by an employee, but the shout from the register from sometimes 3 employees is a bit much.  QT is now my perferred stop in the morning because of the 59 cent fountian drink. I mostly drink brewed teas. When I say brewed, I mean when you have to make the tea like your making coffee. No hoses from a mystery back area. QT offers 3 different flavors, Black Mango, Regular and Pineapple something...I always get the Black Mango. All three offer sweetened and unsweetened.

I like coming here because there is always a person working. And their constantly cleaning and moving around getting things done. One lady last Friday, 9/18/15 even helped an older lady. She got dropped off by a cab with big bags of laundry. I heard the driver ask if she was going to be all right, when she said yes, he left. She stood there for awhile than got my attention and asked about the machines taking quarters. They don't, you purchase a card and reload it. She walked up to the card machine than came back upset because all she had was a bunch of quarters and the card machine only takes dollar bills. (there's also a change maker, but from bigger bill to smaller bills). I found the lady working and translated what was going on. I don't know what she did but she helped the older lady with getting a card. Than later as I was drying, I saw the worker pulling out laundry and loading it unto the dryer with the older lady following her. She was practically doing her laundry for the customer! This worker is always nice and helpful but she doesn't know too much English but can understand my crappy Spanish just fine. All the other ladies I've seen here are also so nice and helpful! Always smile when I look up and happen to make eye contact. Always say good bye when I leave.  I just wonder what happened to Norma? She was the only one that spoke English well.  They have plenty of carts in my opinion. About ten or twelve, but of course when it's busy your lucky to grab one. I also know they have some not so good ones locked away, if you know each other well enough, she might go in there and grab you one, even if they aren't that great, it's still appreciated.  Free Wifi, although the last few weeks my stuff wouldn't connect. Could just be me.... TV's always going on news, movies in English and Spanish. Different options on sizes of washers you need. The dryers can get really hot so be careful of melting your clothes. The first 20mins I have it on High, than the last 20mins I put it on Medium.

Chips and Guacamole is an ABSOLUTE must!!! Yes it's expensive but so worth it! Tortas are damn delicious too. Carna Asada and the Carne Asada with bacon....I forget the name. Street tacos are pretty good too...we go back often.

First Kathy was our server and extremely efficient. She put up with my coworker who kept changing her mind. LoL Even I got annoyed but she kept her cool.  Thursday was 50 cent wings. So I got six honey hot. It was nice and saucy and delicious! The skin is nice and crunchy and big pieces. My coworkers got the hot, they didn't come with sauce like I'm used to and all of them were served with blue cheese. Want ranch? You have to ask for it.  I got the Fish & Chips with house salad. Sorry about the picture, by the time I remember to take one I had already dug in! LoL Okay, the whole meal was huge and I pushed food on my coworkers and still had to waste some of it. The house salad is a big serving. A huge helping of shoe string fries that I piled on a plate and handed over to my coworkers, the few I had were tasty. The fish are bigger than my hand and I was given 2 pieces. It was good with the tarter sauce that wasn't JUST tarter sauce, it had some kind of orange tint to it. Hot sauce? But it was delicious and I could only eat one.  The fruity tea I got was delicious, freshly brewed - ask for extra ice.  My coworker got the soup of the day, cream of potato bacon. It had huge chunks and my coworker said it was delicious. Two coworkers got the BLT half sandwhich and it came with heaping pile of bacon that looked extra crispy and something I would get next time.  We all said next time we're downtown, we'll be stopping here.

At first I missed it since its in this teeny strip mall type thing south of Hatcher. The little parking lot was full so I decided to chance the Wireless Phone store next door, parking at the end, completly ignoring the tow away zone. Living on the dangerous side - that's me! LOL  When I walked in, it was PACKED. Sunday 300pm, guess everyone came in after church. I was quickly greeted by a waitress and asked for here or to go. I ordered out and got the Alambre De Res. I asked her how many tacos come in it and was told an order of three. Only when I got home to find two corn tortillas hiding under the mound of beef. Anyway, as I was standing there to pay, another waitress was handing over these two fruit things, the nosey person I am quickly asked what is that because it looked delicious. She called it a Fruit with Whip Cream, apparently it had sour cream and pecans in it to. So I ordered the Strawberry one as well.  As it was just to crowded for me, I stepped out side, eating my Fruit Cream and waited for my order to appear. I was told it would take 10-15mins which I was fine with because of the crowd it was understandable. After about 5mins I realized it started to get hot and I stepped back inside and grabbed a seat and proceeded to people watch.  There was one waitress who's sole purpose was to answer the phone, taking to go orders and packing them up as they were ready. Another one stood at the cash register and accepted all payments. I saw a man there not dressed in the pink shirt and khaki pants, perhaps the Manager? He would talk with the waiteresses, pointing out things that they quickly addressed. Just made sure everything was running smoothly.  As I waited, I munched on the Fruit Cup - delicious! It had chunks of strawberries and pieces of pecans. Almost like yogurt. When I finally got my order home, and opened the box it just looked delicious...only missing one corn toritlla. What I liked about the meal is that it had a huge wedge of grilled onion and chili, so I could take a bite of that with the tacos. Grilled veggies are the best! The "salad" I didn't bother with, I think it was shredded lettuce, could've been cabbage, but since I didn't touch it, I'm not sure. Beans would've been a better side. I munched on the slices of cucumber and radishes that accompanied it. The meat was delicious with the melted cheese on top and with the salsa - a delicious meal it made!  Oh. And all these reviews about it being a sketchy/scary area. Umm..not really..  6/1/14 Update: This visit I got the Mexican Pizza in the appetizer section - delicious! I also got the Alambre De Cameron (Shrimp Tacos) SO GOOD! Filled with shrimp, topped with melting cheese. I didn't want the "salad" that usually comes with it and asked for beans instead. Welll...they gave me double serving of rice. BUT! It wasn't the typical Spanish Rice that I do NOT under any circumstances like. It had corn, bell peppers and NO hint of tomato sauce anywhere. YUM!

My server Esther was super nice and helpful. We talked a little too much, felt like I was hogging her from others. I'm sure she didn't mind as she carried half the conversation.  I ordered the appetizer of macaroni and cheese with seafood. And the Pasta Mardi Gras. Both delicious and large servings! Most I took home as we were talking so much my full signal went off.   It's on the expensive side, but the food, service and decor makes it worth it.

I've been going here since I was 16? 17? ....15years now? I love their lemonade and peanut butter malt if you don't mind the calories. The burger deal has always been my favorite along with the fried mushrooms. I loved the fries they had years ago where changed, their good but not as good as 10yrs ago. The parking lot is small and in the back, one way in, one way out through the drive thru.  If your not feeling so gluttonous, the grilled chicken sandwich is also delicious or maybe a corn dog hits your fancy.

This place is fantastic! I always get the Green Curry, just vegetables -HOT! The Red Curry is always great. They both have FRESH large pieces of carrots, mushrooms, etc. SO GOOD! It comes with a side of white rice. Hot or Cold, if you get it to go it will last for dinner and breakfast the next day. Just make sure you don't get the lunch size.  The place is small but plenty of seating, the decor is nice and the service is good.

Been here a couple of times. The single catfish with mac N cheese: Catfish was delish! Crisped to perfection and tasty. The mac N cheese was decent, the noodles a bit over cooked but extra cheesy like I would make it at home.  The single whiting and sweet potato tots. OMG, who doesn't love sweet potato tots?!? I think they double fry it, but whatever they do, its got a crispy outside soft inside. I think the whiting was too "fishy" for me. First the look, the inner part was a purplish brown that didn't look appetizing and I put to the side. I didn't care for the smell.  The lady was super nice who took my order. The restroom was clean and she had to unlock it for me. The decor was hip and I liked it, they had the news going on the screen which I liked.

This place. Its on the ground floor on the west side of the Metro Mall. I'm not sure what dept store is right there as I go inside by the closest entrance, I just look for Castle's and Coasters and as soon as I pass it, I turn in.  Sometimes I do the 12 chair. But the 30 min table for 30 bucks is good. The do both sides evenly. This last time I was there I got the 1 hour Combo: Table, Chair and Foot for 55.00. Only I asked for Table and Foot only, they were very accomodating and it was fantastic!  My feet definently needed it. I'm here atleast once a month, more if I do the cheapy 12.00 but worth it.

I stopped because I wanted somthing cold and delicious. I saw Frappe Chai (way cool), it gave you the option of regular milk or soy.Which is fantastic since me and dairy aren't the best of friends. For some reason I like to read for myself the option than asking someone, so seeing that I knew thats what I wanted. Iced Chai into a Frappicino...and with Soy?! - YES Please!  I was greeted fairly quickly, I had the option of 20oz or 32oz. I controlled myself and got the 20oz, cost $4.33. The board said 5 bucks, but who am I to correct the employee when its in my favor?! LOL, I'm sure it was some type of happy hour though.  During the transaction, the cashier stopped to pass on a message to another employee, apoligezed and finished up. I'm noting this only becuase the employee she talked to, walked out to the customers who were sitting at the tables. Asking if they want a to go box, wiping down counters, basically asking them how it was going. Waitress duties but without the restaruant, pretty nice!  I walked around while waiting, they had so many cute things!! The magnets were pretty funny, at 5bucks I might pick up a few next time. They had these really cute headbands, I picked up and put right back down when I say the price - $9.99. To much...for a headband atleast!! I didn't go to far into the Market, but stayed around the souviner type section.  Well waiting I got annoyed because a woman who walked in a minute behind me got her iced drink first. When I walked back to the counter, the employees back was to me, telling her coworker she made this twice. Turned around, smiled and handed my drink over, "Frappe Chai with SOY." Emphasis on the soy. *Lightbulb* She had to remake my drink because she used regular milk. Annoyance gone! Thank you for realizing the mistake and fixing it! Not passing it off as soy. My tummy thanks you to!

I come here about every 2 months, when I need a good washing. I always go first thing in the morning, about 930AM so it isn't that busy and I know they will take their time. Because this place does get busy and backs up.  Before I get to this place, I grab a bag and throw everything that could be stolen in it. My CDs and connectors for IPOD, phone, etc. I had a car charger/wall charger combo in my car, used it the day before. Took my car here, the next day - my charge was gone! I don't let anyone drive my car and no one had been in that time period. So, I carry my bag filled with stealable stuff inside with me. I ask for the Gold service, 18.99, if you have a punch card, they take off 4 dollars. I believe this is new as of this year. I don't remember being asked for this before.  FIRST: I have no idea what her name is and I know it isn't helpful, but if she's there, I will point her out and ask that she clean my car. She always cleans my car really good. Wipes down everything, cleaning every plastic area, windows, etc. So I rarely have a problem with this place. With the exception of my charger being stolen.  BUT: I did observe this lady not have such a great experience. The young boy didn't wipe off the window completly that they write what type of service you want. She had to point it out. When she went to get in, they forgot a cleaning spray bottle on her seat. She got back out and had to dump her ashtray. (I know they dump your trash can, but I don't smoke, but I would think they would dump the ashtray) Than she grabbed a wash rag from their bin and started wiping down the center counsel of her vehicle herself.  Unfortunantly it's a hit and miss here it seems. Or knowing who to ask to clean your car. Since I bring my car every 2/3 months and know who to ask for I like this place.

So far, the ONLY thing I like about this place is the Cochata. Its a coffee, horchata mix - delicious!  The salsa leaves something to be desired. Its more lime than actual salsa...and salsa isn't blended into a thin pulp. They ask if I want spicy or not, of course spicy, but it had no spice to it whatsoever. I've had the carne asada and the pastor burrito, both are lacking in flavor. To little meat and way to much tortilla. Nothing else inside.  The service is...meh. No smiles, or greetings. Just a "Can I take your order?"  The parking isn't the greatest. You get 1 handicap, and 3 spaces - 1 of which is taken by the America's Taco shop van. The rest I guess is shared with the Antique store next door.  The only reason and the only thing I come here for is the Cochata, at just under 4 bucks, its a large iced drink and worth it. After trying the food here twice and both times disappointed, I don't bother with anything else.

I think I found my new Thai place. I also feel like I'm cheating on my old Thai place. LoL. I walked in and was greeted right away. I was already armed with what I wanted and ordered to-go. She was very nice and quickly passed on the order to another woman who gave it to the cook. The dining area was clean, quiet, dark and cool. There was a flat screen playing AMC (yay! I have no use for sports). There were a couple diners and listening to the waitress take one women and older gentlemans order, she was super patient. Explained everything to them and adjusted the order as needed. To me, its not just how they treat me, but others when they don't know their being observed.   I ordered Vegetable Red Curry (Yea, I'm obsessed with curry). I just said Hot, not sure if they go by number system or what. I waited about 5mins., in that time a couple to go orders were picked up - good sign, since it was 4pm yet. Not quite dinner time for most. Telling me it could get busy during peak hours.  I got home and opened my containers. First, the rice they give is a very large portion! It looked like 4 scoops. The Curry is also a large serving, good for two people or for two meals. It was filled with large vegetable pieces - carrots, snow peas, broccolli, etc. And it was HOT!! I was sniffling and sweating - omg! It was perfect! I had to stop and grab the fan and sit in front of it!  This place I will definently be going back to. Its a lot closer and a straight shot for me. Only 4 stars because I did only try one dish. I'm looking foward to trying the Beef Salad, Wonton Soup and other interesting dishes they have.  Update 9.3.13 - So I decided to dine in...and learned my lesson. I was seated quickly and just as quickly forgotten. Luckily I brought a book to read. The lady who sat me just walked away. Than a couple minutes later she sat a couple and quickly got their drink orders. I was a bit annoyed. But then another lady (Lek) appeared from the back 5-10mins later, she quickly got my order and gave me a glass of water.  Wonton Soup: First it is HUGE, omg I was embaressed becuase it was just me. Lek was like don't worry, you can take the rest home. Its good for 3+ people, and its only one size. It was really flavorful, had the huge chunks of vegetables, corn, carrots, leeks, etc. No spice to it and it was delicious!  Beef Salad: It wasn't a typical salad...when I think salad, I think lettuce with everything else. This came wiith slices of cucumber, tomato and a wedge of cabbage. It was a good portion sized and super hot! I didn't care for the cabbage, but with the cucumber/tomato was good. I actually went and bought a cucumber to eat with the beef salad the next day. A couple pieces were chewy, but upon inspection, (gross I know lol) it was the fatty part of the meat. It seems they don't trim off those parts.  Over all it was still a delicious meal, and Lek serving me improved my mood. She helped me the first time I came to this restaurant. Very nice and helpful, quickly bringing me anything I might need.

I walked in and there was only one other customer, the place was clean and two ladies were behind the counter. I'm pretty sure they were mother and daughter as the younger one had called her "mom".  The older woman, Brenda helped me decide what to eat as I've been to Subway but not here before. She first offered a sub that was her favorite but I said healthy than she told me to get the chicken salad. I like that they suggested items they knew and have tried, because I was going to say cold chicken but both insisted I get it warmed.   At first I almost couldn't get the salad as they realized they had no shredded lettuce or the chopped lettuce. But I asked if I could get the spinach leaves as its healthier anyway and I pointed out the chopped lettuce looked old and it was mostly white parts. At first I passed on the tomatoes because they looked ugly but she offered better tomatos that was in the fridge.  She offered this sirachi slaw that was new for free. At first I passed because it didn't look good, but gave in because she was so helpful to me and wanted the feedback. I took one bite and said it was gross. LoL. I think there was too much sirachi in it because it was more red than green as the pictured showed.  I wanted a whole pickle but forgot to ring it up as we were discussing cookies, but as I sat to eat she remembered and just brought me a few slices of pickles.  They were both super nice and great service, if I was on that side of town, I might stop by again. The warm chicken and sharp cheddar she suggested was so good, I could've just ate that.

The cashier was really nice and had a competition on who had the worst morning - I won. LOL Later she walked around wiping tables and asking everyone if they needed anything else that she can run and grab.  Get the small burger and fries, because its not small at all. I got the works, at first I thought it would be overwhelming, but it was good! The fries were okay.  My coworker got the grilled cheese....I could've made that at home.  The fountain drink station was cool. Except all Coke products were out.

I first walked in and there was nobody there, I caught a glimpse of someone in the back. Since I wasn't sure what I wanted, I didn't mind waiting. I settled on carne asada tacos and 1 fish taco. When the girl finally appeared, she took my order and I handed her my credit card. As she swiped it, she started talking to the girl behind me. I signed my reciept, assumed that was it and walked away to wait.  Carne Asada Street Tacos: They were good, the tortillas were nice and hot. Plentiful of meat. But I've had better...from a food truck no less. The green salsa I found was good but not spicy.  Fish Street Taco: The fish was great in flavor, from the little piece that was given to me. I had to remove half the cabbage before taking a bite. It seemed they were making up for the lack of fish with cabbage.  The bar area was really nice, it looked almost like a club. Flat screen was playing golf.  Regardless, I wouldn't be returning here.

First. Don't come in here if your "just looking" because guess what? You'll find product in your hand and walking up to the register. LoL ...Unless your a dude, because I'm sure you'll be holding your ladies purse and following her around. Not fun.  Anywho. This place has a lot of fun, flirty, pretty anything you can think of jewelry. I even bought a necklace...FYI I don't wear jewelry. It was a gold cat claw and being the crazy cat lady I aspire to be, I got it. :) I also found a highlighter pink pig coin purse - had to have it! LoL I also got a light pink bear coin purse for my mother. We share some odd ball tastes - shocker.  The place can be pretty expensive, my coworker bought a very cute top, 30 bucks! No thank you. If its over $8 I had to think really hard on getting it. They have a clarence section upstairs, so thats where we end up migrating. But you can't help but look at all the cute purses, shoes and all the sparklies! I've picked up and reluctantly put down a lot of stuff in that store, what can I say I'm a cheap ass...or I buy expierences not merchandise. LoL - snort!  The place is huge, it has a staircase with wide small steps, don't ask why but every time I'm there I trip going up. Theres also an elevator for those so inclined. It's very spacious and they use up all the walls and shelves with color scheme merchandise. The staff is very nice, the first time a male salesperson walked up to our group and handed us little baskets we could put our stuff in.  I like that if you walk in on the bottom, you can leave out the second floor and down to the street via an escalator. There's a Gold's Gym next door, a couple restaurants and acorss the street is more restaurants and a walgreens..or is it a cvs? But when you a have a 20 dollar bill burning a hole in your pocket ladies - come here.

Sometimes its good to have a lot of choices. But when you're starving and you just want something...not so good because everything sounded good! I don't understand the menu's being huge and plastered high up on walls. I know, I know, take a few giant steps back maybe you'll see it better. Hell, step outside and look...oh yea, nevermind I forgot my glasses. LoL! I think that was my only issue about the place.  OKay, so I got a 8" sub with a large fountain drink - 8 bucks. Not bad. I don't remember what it was called, I think it was the #12. It had avocado, provelone and turkey slices. I love that they pile on a lot of shredded lettuce on it. I asked for sprouts, but she heard sauce. And it got slapped with mayo. Whatever, I was hungry and it still tasted good, except with all that sauce the insides kept slidding out the back everytime I took a bite.  The place was nice, seating is limited. They do have some outside tables. The music is a little too loud. The cashier was patient as we hemmed and hawed and helpful when we asked questions. Once we ordered, the sandwhichs were put together very quickly and the name of your sandwhich yelled out for you at the other end. All 4 of us enjoyed our sandwhichs. 1 coworker got a pickle to eat later. When she opened it later that day, it was sliced in 4, and she gave me one. OMG! I know what I'm getting next time.

Ive gone here a few times, and the fish tacos are the best. If fish isn't your thing, go for the pastor tacos.  The tall bald guy with goatee is super nice. So have a question? He's happy to answer.  The place is super small so I never dine in. Its a pain to find but once you locate it, you can find the quick ins and outs.  The only bad thing is there closed Sunday and Monday, the days I crave fish tacos.

Well another group was walking out as we were walking towards it. When we asked what happend? They just said it was to expensive, $10-$12 a plate. Not to to expensive, so we still went in.  The place is super small. L shaped dining area. Not really good for more than 1 large group. There was 5 of us and a group of 6 already took the more comforatable spot. So we squeezed into a 4 sitter, not to uncomfortable. Come in twos and it'll work fine. Nicole was our server and she was very helpful to our questions and accomodated our split check request.  I ordered the Green Chili Cornbread: Even though it's in the appetizer section - it's huge. I was able to split it among the five of us and we all agreed, it was delicious! Cornbread with corn kernals, black beans topped with pulled pork. Yum Yum! I also order the Fuego Tacos, shrimp. The taco's were super filled and overflowing with shrimp and toppings - no skimping on the shrimp here! The spanish rice was delicious, usually I don't bother with it if it comes with the meal, but I actually enjoyed it. The black beans...well they were black beans - one bite was enough.  Two of my coworkers went with the sliders. One got meatloaf, the other got chicken. Both wanted the beef - but no beef! Apparently the stopped selling the beef sliders. Really?! Both came with sweet potato fries. The meatloaf was too small, and she normally eats like a bird sooo yea. The chicken was good. Since the didn't have the Green Chili Beef, she got a side of green chili to eat with her chicken sliders. Both said the sweet potato fries were delicious, and I agree as I stole a few.  My Lead got the Chili Rellano or as we were saying Chili Jay Leno. It was HUGE!!! She actually cut up half of it and shared with us. It was evenly fried and covered with the panko covering. Filled with chicken and cheese - it was really delicious. I'll be getting that next time.  Finally, my other coworker got the Fuego Salad with Chicken. She said the dressing was really good. It had a sweet and tangy taste to it. At one point I caught her breathing out of her mouth and I asked if it was spicy - YES! And we started laughing. It came with those chips tossed on top to give it that crunch. She really enjoyed it.  Other than that, it was a really filling delicious meal. The seating arrangements suck but they made it work. I used the bathroom while there, it was unisex. But it was really cute and homey. It had a little table with a lamp lit, so you can turn on the overhead or just leave only the lamp on. It was colorfully painted and nicely decorated, just don't mind the huge packages of toilet paper under the sink. LoL

I walked in and waited as the sign on a cut out asked, not sure where to get my take out order...  An older man with greying hair, trudged up to me glaring. No smile, no greeting, no identification as to if he even worked there. He just glared as he slowed in front of me. That's when I said I had an order for pick up. Still glaring, he pointed to the back end of the bar. He does work there as I saw him pass to the back while I paid. But Wow! Deduct two stars...   I walked towards the back end of the bar and immediately heard and felt the stickiness of the floor. Something was not cleaned up properly, perhaps the mop was used and just spread the stickiness around? I tried maneuvering around, but there was no getting around it. Deduct a star...  The young bartender? Bus boy? Smiled and greeted me, I told him I have a pick up. He said my name, verified my order and showed me my ticket/cost $17.50. I paid and signed, he wished me well. Add a star...  The chips and salsa were the highlights. They came with both a red AND green salsa! Green was my favorite, and spicy. Red was spicier but still tasty. The blue corn tamale was smothered in sauce, so was it really blue corn? Couldn't have been able to tell you under the sauce and melted cheese. The red beef burrito, enchilada style can feed two easily. I ended up pulling out the beef and eating the flour tortilla and sauce. Tamale and burrito, Egh.. Deduct a star... Chips and salsa shouldn't be the only highlight.  Will I be back? Maybe for that green salsa, perhaps a different menu item? But then again, perhaps not.

No matter what time of day I show up at this place, the people are super nice! Most often when I decide to treat myself, its 540 in the morning. They greet you and smile, ask how your day is, whats your plans for the day, wishing you a good day,etc. Just top customer service...which is hard for me because I'm so not a morning person, but I try to be nice back. Usually they have music going, pretty loud inside and their dancing and singing as they make your drink. It makes you want to work there so you can join in the fun. But also asking, how are they so peppy this damn early?! LoL  I like the Iced Chai here, its only one size at 4.25. They ask if you want cinnamon or nutmeg on top, which is pretty cool. The Carmelizer is also a good choice. I've tried the Cocomo, but it was just to much chocolate and not enough coconut for me.  Location is kinda tough to get in. Off of Glendale, hope there isn't a bus sitting at the bus stop, cause your stuck waiting, unless you want to go curb checking.   Today, I went here because they have the overhang at the window, going across the drive way - protection from the rain!

I've tried all 3 new ice cream flavored coffee. My favorite is the J'Mocha Almond, least fav is the Cookie Dough, Butter Pecan - second. $2.59 for a large iced coffee isn't bad. I also like their Iced Irish Cream they had..or have..  The inside of this DD was really nice and modern. A looooong area to it, the ordering and pick up at the back of the house. Seating at the front. The only thing, when it gets around 4/5pm when the sun is in the west, those big beautiful window walls means sunshine up the you know what!  The parking lot is pretty busy because of all the other stores. Service was courteous.

Erin? I think his name was.  It started off great, he was super patient with my undecidedness. I hadn't eaten all day and everything sounded good!! He quickly brought a fresh iced coffee when I didn't even realize I slurped the first one down while purusing the menu.  After talking it over with Erin, we decided the breakfast burger was the ticket. Not sure what it was called, it was hasbrown, egg and bacon on a burger pattie.  Once I recieved my meal, Erin disappeared!!! He dropped off my ticket not 2 minutes after he gave me my food and magically fell off the earth. There was about 10 other waiters/waitress there, discussing what sounded like a meeting but was really just an excuse to sit and gossip.   Not one of these people asked if I needed anything else...which I did. Tobasco sauce would've been fantastic with my meal. The a/c was set to freeze your ass off, and that if you didn't finish your meal in 10mins, it would be cold.  Finally, I got up and paid for my meal when the hostess walked back to her station. Why do they ask if we want to add anything more to the original bill? There's a spot for us to write that in when they hand us the recipt. Sounded fishy. Besides, I try and tip in cash anyway, which I only left a couple bucks. Erin was attentive...in the begining.  Will not be back.

It's the southwest corner, behind a U-Haul place that used to be a gas station. You might miss it. When you drive in it doesn't look promising. A 711, tattoo shop, and liquor store are all in this very small shopping center.  I walked in and it was small. 4 tables that seat 4 and 1 table that seats 2. Very small. I went there for one thing, a Mexican hot dog. The kind you see in parking lots, with their little carts on a Friday/Saturday night. But thankfully, this place was an actual restaurant! I didn't have to battle the winds or sun.  They have two selections La Reyna hot dog $4.00 and Sonoran hot dog $3.00.  I went ahead and got both. I'm not sure which was which but I believe the Sonoran hot dog had the bacon, onions (grilled or fresh) and mayonaisse on it which was my favorite! It was spicer, they both had beans, guacamole, diced tomaotes and goat cheese sprinkled on top. The bread is amazing like the previous person said! They heat them up on the grill and it has this fluffy light texture to it. The dog's are served with a grilled chili and if you want, french fries. I went ahead and got the french fries with one and glad I did. They're the crispy outside but mushy inside that I like!   If your eating in you get a basket of chips and salsa, so this was a lot of food for just one person. The green salsa was in hourse made. I say this because it had that not quite blended completly look, the long strings of jalapeno and tomatos were in there. I also saw large tomatos and chili's on the grill. At first I didn't know why there was a lot of fresh veggies on the grill, did they run out of counter space? But I realized later that they were grilling it to make more salsa.  The service was really nice. A young boy about 14/15yo took my order (the son) and the daughter 15/16yo asked a couple times if everything was okay. When I walked in there were a few tables that had baskets and used items on the table. But when I sat down to eat in, the girl quickly cleaned up the tables and asked if she can wipe down my table saying it was a little sticky. It wasn't to me but it was nice to have a clean table cleaned again. There was no trash cans to dump your stuff, which explained the dirty tables. They pick up the trash after you leave.  They had torta's, breakfast burriots, but I'm not sure what else because all I was interested in was the hot dogs. :]

Got the free Thai Tea with check in. Didn't even drink half, it tasted bad. The tea was different than what I've had at other Thai restaurants. I like that I automatically got a water with my dine in experience.   I was craving Pad Thai, so that's what I ordered. With tofu. It was quickly made and brought to my table. I also didn't finish this meal.   The egg roll that came with it was mostly fried dough, a couple shreds of carrot. Very underwhelming. The Pad Thai was not spicy AT ALL. Which was disappointing, because that's what I love about Thai food, the spiciness! The tofu was squishy, the texture was just like eating a undercooked boiled egg. I've had tofu before, this was just eck... Speaking of eggs, there was egg's mixed in the noodles. I didn't like the noodles either, they were overcooked and I could've just swallowed then whole with how soft they were. Man! I've never been this disappointed of a ENTIRE meal before. And I have had Pad Thai before, I'll just go back to that other place next time.  At least the waitress was nice and apologized when she noticed I didn't eat much and I explained why. I quickly paid and got out of there, it's also not a great area. Actually saw a used needle in the parking lot, amongst other things I observed. I wouldn't go back.

Lady who sat me at the bar for my take out placing was nice. Another lady swung by giving me a water and chips and salsa! I said oh, I'm ordering to go. She's like, I know. And I'm like, oh.  LoL okay. Chips and salsa are my favorite food so that was nice. The guy who took my order....I saw the face you made as you walked away.  -_-  Nachos: Asked chicken or carnitas, he suggested half and half.  Okay. Chicken was delicious, dug out the carnitas after two bites, didn't care for it. Suggestion, don't add the meat, doesn't need it.   Mexican Corn: Do It!!!!  Mo's dessert: Saved for later and was okay. Mayhap better eaten right away...  FYI, to go order I got chips and salsa. If I had known that, I wouldn't have ordered the nachos. Ate these the next day, chips started to go stale but the salsa was better cold. I'm not a fan of the dark red salsa. But yum!!  Side note : the chips and salsa young lady was super nice while I waited. We bonded over yoga, recommended the Bikram Yoga Phoenix down the street. Welcome to Phoenix Alaska girl. :)

Okay, I've seen this place many times as I do my laundry right next door for the last couple of years. And it's NEVER busy. Yea I see maybe one or two people go in there, but I've often asked myself: how are they staying in business??  One Friday I decided I just needed a quick trim and paint on my toes. Not looking for anything special, soooo since I'm right here and its 30mins before closing, I'll cheat on my regular pedicure lady this once.  I opened the door and asked if I can get a pedicure, again its 30mins before closing so I just wanted to make sure. He said of course and sat me down. These are beautiful, red leather (pleather?) seats, brand new, very comfortable! The only thing missing is your control of what type of massage you want it to give you...come on! give me some buttons to push!!  A shy quiet young lady comes out and starts the process. Problem One: The place you put your feet is super high. My ass is fat, so this is sooo not comfotable!! LoL. I understand not wanting to bend way over to attack my toes, but come on! It's like sitting on those little chairs at the beach, thats only about 3 inches off the ground - not the greatest position. Especially when the bottom of the feet need to be down, instead of comfortably relaxed up naturally.  Problem Two: My regular lady must have put super glue on that last coat of polish, because the lady had to bust out the tools to scrap some of that glitter crap off. LoL!! So a majority of her time was spent there and I barely got a massage. Totally not her fault!  Problem Three: She HAD to be new. Why you ask? The way she put on the polish. It wasn't the professional, three strokes it's covered that I'm used to seeing. I felt like one of my nieces was painting my toes.   In the end, instead of closing promptly at 7, the doors were locked at 710pm.  I thanked them for letting me come in, gave her a tip in cash. Here when paying with a card, you have to add the tip onto it before it's ran. You don't write it down when signing your name like at other places. $17.00 for a pedicure, wasn't expecting much, didn't get much and won't be going back.   They do have really nice new chairs, tables, etc. so they have that going for them.

This was so cool! Got the happy hour ticket. Got there early but they still let me on. There are bathrooms located on the second floor. Otherwise no place to sit and wait around for your appointed time, since they let me go anyway that was cool. There was also a bar area where you can stand around and wait. It was really modern looking, dark and that cool vibe going. No line anywhere, and I was the only person in my cabin!  I did have to wait for a few cabins to go by since I was waiting for one that had a bar in it. I really enjoyed this experience more since I was the only person inside, crowds annoy me. I could walk all around, stand wherever and not have to worry about my bags as I just set it down and left it there. Bartender Robert was awesome, and in formative. He talked about before the strip was so big, pointed out places to see. And got me buzzed on 3 little margaritas. LoL I so wish I had more cash on hand to drop in his bucket. They work off tips and I thought there would be an ATM around, but there wasn't. You can also leave a comment in the gift shop area about your bartender, which I also did.  You must go, get the happy hour and bring cash! Every trip to Vegas will include a ticket here from now on.  There's a little bench to sit on, but why are you sitting? Walk around, take pictures! Enjoy the 30min ride!

We got there just after 11am, so right before the crowd got in. When you enter, there are couple menus on the wall that explain how to get your pizza. The pre made pizza's are 5.99 or you can go for the unlimited topping for 7.99.  When you figure out the crust and sauce or pre decided pizza, think subway. You get in one of two areas where they start your pizza. You tell them what you want and move along, unless its the unlimited topping than you stand and point out what you want. I got the White pizza, but decided I wanted mushrooms and red onions so it ended up being the unlimited. There is no sauce on this pizza, so keep that in mind when ordering as I like extra sauce on my pizzas.  Than while paying and finding a seat, they pop your pizza in the oven, when it comes out they top it with parsley and than walk around yelling your name until you raise your hand and say PRESENT! lol Kidding, but you do have to raise your hand to get his/her attention so they can drop your pizza off. A couple of times I felt sorry for the guy because he would weave in and out of everyone, go outside yelling these people's names because they weren't paying attention.  My coworkers got The Island, Margarita and two shared a veggie pizza, not sure what it was called. For those with a "healthy" appetitte, one pizza to yourself is just fine. I was nice and full. But one can be shared between two people just fine.  The decor was nice, red and grey. There's more inside seating around the corner, you don't realize it because of the soda machine. It looks tight but it works. The people making the pizza was nice, the cashier couldv'e been a bit more engaging or even plastered a smile, twice two workers walked by and asked how our pizza was. One guy was concerned because there was 5 of us and only 4 pizza's, I guess not a lot of people share but it was nice of him.  Will definently go back.

Okay. I found my fish tacos!! Well. Fish burrito at this visit. I missed the fish tacos from Taco Ayoteca. But it was brought back here, only with shredded cheese... Which was odd but okay, it was delicious and huge!   I ordered two pastor tacos as well. Those were delicious! Not your standard pastor street tacos, but yummy! Meat was saucy and tender. Green garnish on top, papaya? But all the same, it was good.   Everyone was nice and patient with me. Didn't feel rushed well standing there deciding. The decor was awesome! Everything new. I liked that they basically left me alone once my food arrived.  No one else came in while I was there. Even so, the employees were detail cleaning which I like to see when I used to work fast food. Can't wait to go back an need try the bacon and 50/50 taco. Not your typical Mexican street tacos, but delicious all the same!

50/50 taco, different but yes! The chorizo wasn't overpowering like I thought it would.  Bacon taco, first bite the bacon was a bit over cooked. But the next bites were explosion of flavor in my mouth! The sauce!!  Steak taco, again first bite it was chewy. It also needed some help with the delicious green salsa.  Horchata, you gotta!! Sweet yum in your mouth.  The random karaoke from Dan was fun, lovin' the reggae. The price is a bit high than I'm used to, but well worth it!

630PM Tuesday Night. Pulled up, lady was nice.  I ordered the wings (Frank's hot sauce flavor ) and fries.  Waited. ...maybe 5mins? It wasn't bad wait...for wings...  I just read the bad reviews here and laughed as they handed my order, the lady was taking another order behind the guy handing my food and both apologized for the wait. It seriously wasn't, but I  appreciate the apology and he even said, everything's fresh. LoL  The sauce on the wings was delicious! I don't know how its made, but the wings had skin and it made them slime like, not like my favorite, wing stop. But who gets wings at a burger place?  Me. Who doesn't care for burgers, and just really wanted the fries. And those tasted just like I remember! Yum!!
