Every time I come here the staff is always super friendly. If would want to be sieatted away from the noise of the other customers they make sure of that.  I have been here in the morning for breakfast, business lunches, and even after a night on mill. I have always had awesome survice.

I love this place. Great atmosphere great food and friendly staff. I have had there fish and chips (Best in Phoenix). Mouth watering burgers and awesome loaded potato skins.  Great place to go for dinner or just go out for a beer. This is my favorite place on mill.

Awesome place. I went in only knowing that I wanted to make a dark room. I walked out with everything to not only make my own dark room, But the confidence that I would do it right. Only going off of what I did in high school the guys there showed me all the equipment that I need and also told me how to use them to get the best results. I cant wait to go back in and learn about new stuff that I can do.

Love these apartments. Found online and was out of state and didn't see the grounds or apartment until I was in state. Couldn't have found a better place. Love the view. The pool is always nice. I have lived here for about 5 months now and didn't even know that there were people living in the same building as me besides the little girl above me. The online stuff is very helpful and fast. Got a nice close car port for a little extra the night grads are friendly.

I loved this place and can't wait to go in and get my hair done again. I felt so at home, the people were super friendly. Went in after reading all of the reviews and was expecting to get an ok cut and color. But what I got was so much more. A stylest that helped find what was right for my skin tone and a really nice conversation that made the time fly by. I will have to admit that I was there for 3 hours but it was so worth it. I tried to find some thing I didn't like about this place but couldn't. When you go in for your first time ask for the free hair cut for new customers.

I had wait 20 minutes at the bar Just for someone to take my order. then I had to wait about 45 minutes for my order of deep fried pickels. Since I was sitting at the bar I could see the kitchen and the cooks spent most of there time standing around talking for a half hour with out doing a damn thing,

Good place to grab wings and beer. I went the opening day of Man of Steal. It was crowded but not to bad. It was fun being able to play the video poker game with more then just the poeple at my table. The servers were nice and fast. Over all I like it.

The workers there are very helpful and sweet. They have a huge selection of saltwater taffy and sugar free. There bulk selection is awesome. Love the fact that everything is wrapped. Nice Pezz area too. Prices are higher the gas stations but it's a candy store not a gas station so understand able. They are my favorite out of all the candy stores I have been to. And the prices are better too. I recommend checking in if you have foursquare. Best place EVER.

Prices were way to high. I was in there about two week ago to show my friend what I thought was going to be a cool candy store but after what i saw I'm never going back. It was a little busy when I went in but after seeing three kids lick the scooper and put them in the candy jar and lick them again I couldn't stay there another second.

I didn't have much to say about this place until my apartment got flooded. They were really nice and help us with every step of the way.

Do not move here. I moved in when it was Tempe Groves and it was perfect. I have now lived here for 2 years. I am counting the day until I move. The pool by the main office looks nice and is some times working. The second pool is always broken and I swear they have only one motor between the two hot tubs. The work out center looks pretty but if you actually try to use any of the equipment you will find most of it is broken. The rent is going up by $155 a month and 855 just for a one bedroom is outrageous. The "upgraded" apartments have a two tone color paint. shitty "wood" floors and the appliances aren't upgraded they are just black instead of white. If you wanna waste your time and check them out go a head. The people in the office are rude and are always changing. The manager is really mean and no there will work with you. I hate this place and can't wait to leave.
