The store is clean but the prices are higher than walmart marketplace. I won't be shopping at Frys again. They don't carry pints in their liquer selection and the beer is far from cheeper too. I guess if you have nothing else to choose from it would be ok.

I was very impressed by their selection of items and knowledge of the staff with some questions I had. This is the first shop I've found the vanilla Cheyennes I smoke at since I left Ga! The prices were reasonable as well.
