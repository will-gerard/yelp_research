Finally found a great sushi spot in Arizona. Definitely will come back again. Their vegetable roll was the best. Veggies were so fresh!

Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended

Well, I ordered penne with Broccoli Alfredo sauce. The menu says it's creamy but it was very liquidly. My partner and one of the friends had eggplant Parmesan sandwich and they said it had no flavor at all. With one exception of my friend, she had a calzone and she said it was really good. The server wasn't that great at all. She didn't pay attention to what we were ordering and got our order wrong forcing us to wait at least another 20 mins. That wait wasn't worth it at all. So if I had to rate this place, it'd be 2 stars out of 5.  Now my mouth is in need of something better and I'll have to get it from elsewhere. Definitely won't be back here like ever.

My partner and I had just become vegetarian last month and I've searched for a vegan/vegetarian restaurant and yelp found me this place. This place rocked our socks out! We took a risk to try infamous spicy buffalo "wings" and we loved it to death! It tastes exactly like a regular chicken. The buffalo sauce was at it's perfect spiciness. As for meals, I ordered original "g" spicy po-boy with thyme fries and my partner ordered secret BBQ chicken sandwich with thyme fries. We both loved them and eat them all up! Absolutely delicious! And the staffs were so friendly and knew how to communicate with us in a heartbeat because we both are deaf. We are coming back no question about it! We will try Nami's their little sister 100% vegan bakery. You need to take your friends over here!!

Fantastic food! For the salad, you do have option to have it wrapped. It's similar how sonic setup since there's no eat in dine. Three tables outside. Hence the name of the place where it says "and go". Ideal for someone in hurry and still get great healthy food. One of the workers knows sign language that makes our experience with communication much easier.

Fantastic sandwich! Finally I found a place that beats subway, jimmy john, and firehouse sub. Their bread is so soft and fresh. Great choices for vegetarian as well. Even better for deaf peeps because they provide a brown bag where you check the ingredients yourself and not having to ask for a paper and pen to comminicate. That's the best part about this place. Vegetarian friendly and deaf friendly are the huge bonus. They tasted extremely good and fresh! Definitely will come back to it. Oh it's also Gluten Free friendly since it does give you the option to go for bowl or lettuce wrap it up. Go and check this place out! Staffs are friendly!

The foods was not too bad. It lacks flavors but my partner's sandwich was delicious. He had roasted veg sandwich and it was full of flavors in it. I got lentil wrap and unfortunately it tasted bland. I ended up added salsa to it and that helped a bit. The prices were too ridiculously high. Nearly costed us thirty dollars just fire a wrap and a sandwich plus two glasses of iced tea. The side were just the chips. For that reason, we probably wouldn't come back again unless we are going there with friends. I still would recommend the place. Price just doesn't agree with me that's all. The iced tea was really delicious, though!

A lot of sandwich to choose. They taste pretty good. A bit too much on the sauce they use but still tasty.
