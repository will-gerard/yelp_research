Quite frankly, this place scares me. Always crowded with security and I always got pushed and shoved. Not my kind of club. Glad this place is closing.

Went here for sisters birthday last Wednesday and we all had a great time! We had about 15 guests and we all shared 3-4 different entree's as a group. Excellent service by Ricky, he was very patient and anything we wanted he was sure to help us with and did it in a prompt manner. The food was amazing like always and we left very full and happy!

Went here for my birthday with about 12 people and we enjoyed out first experience at Grimaldi's. We had about 4-5 large pizzas and had a lil leftover to take home but boy was that the best pizza I have ever had!! A lil bit hard to find but this is my new favorite pizza place! :)

Always come here for my uncle and grandpas birthdays and the food gets better and better every time I go! My favorite dish hands down are the ribs, talk about bliss! Would highly recommend this place to anyone of my friends.

Thought this place was wonderful when we first looked at the place, spacious, great kitchen and living area. Well our fridge leaked and always got our food, our AC leaked and we FINALLY got a new unit outside the apartment but did that fix the problem? No. Maybe we got a bad apartment but still it was a headache. The complex is right down the street from a not so good part of town, dont believe me??look up on the Police website of the crime that has happened recently, almost all are Auto Theft related..and I have a locking gas cap on my car now because of the fact that I would get up to go to work and i'd start my car and what did you know...in my window for my speedometer read the message "gascap"  so i took a look at it and BOOM  there was my gas cap hanging by the string as soon as i opened the flap along with HALF my tank missing. Good if you like tennis courts and being right down the street from AZ Mills mall.

My boyfriend and I went here last night on a recommendation from his mom and we had a good experience except for a couple things that bugged me.  We sat down and had our drink order immediately taken, which is a plus. Then my boyfriend ordered an app, the Steamers(New Zealand, white sauce) and he said they were delightful! For our entree, I ordered the Chef's salad and he ordered lasagna. His looked fabulous and he said it tasted amazing and just like home. I had ordered my salad without onions, tomatoes and peppers and it came out with everything on it and quite frankly, it really bugged me. I had to take everything off so by the time my boyfriend was halfway done I had just started to eat my salad. I work in the industry so I didn't complain but it just would've been nice to know if it came pre made cause then I would've gotten something else. We ordered cheesecake and tiramisu, he got his to go and I wanted to eat mine there, and as I was eating it smelt really heavily of cleaning products. We look over and someone was mopping the floors a few tables away from us. They close at 10 and we looked at the clock and it was 9:40 with 3 tables still sitting including ours and I ended up taking mine Togo cause the smell was horrid and I couldn't enjoy my dessert. Overall this restaurant had very good food and we really enjoyed going there, but I gave it two stars because of my food mishap and the early cleaning while guests were still there.

Excellent place for good food and a grand ole time! They have a mechanical bull that is awesome for those drunken moments :) and the main reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because its the place I go to watch my beloved Texas Longhorns!

Love Buffalo Wild wings, but not this location. Went there with my boyfriend and his friend and a server took us to our table and it took them 10-15 min to get someone  aka the manager over to our table to greet us and give us all water and get our drink order. I normally get the honey bbq wings and when they came out they had absloutely no sauce on them. never will go back here again, kinda disappointed cause its close to home.
