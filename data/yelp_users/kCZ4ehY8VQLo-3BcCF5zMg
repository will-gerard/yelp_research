Well I returned home yesterday after the completion of this weekend's extravaganza. Of course it would not be complete without a review of the two main events and the services we received thereof.  At minimum, I will attempt to discuss the tasks that I did to make sure that both the Mandalay Bay Hotel Towers and Pure Management did not take advantage of us.  THEstay: We booked the Media Suite at Mandalay, the website states that the room's prices starts at $510/night. In reality, that price is for a middle of the week booking and is off peak. Although, we booked this room almost 6 months in advance they offered us:  1st Night $689.99 / 2nd Night $779.99 / 3rd Night $779.99 / 4th Night $689.99  The room was guaranteed at 3pm, according to their staff the room was not ready and it was already 5pm. Maggie the staff member discounted the 2nd and 3rd night $100.00 for our inconvenience.  Therefore saving a total of $200.00 on the room, but I was not satisfied. They stated that it would be ready at 7pm; I told them that this was unacceptable and in exchange they gave us complimentary dinners at their in house restaurant the 'Bayside Buffet'. So Francis, Wendell, Clarence and I headed to their restaurant. It was an interesting beginning to a weekend that would spell a great deal of challenges. When it was all said and done these are all the items that we received free of charge from the Mandalay.  3 Roll Away Beds @ $15/night = 9 x $15 = $135.00  2 Videos = $ 35.00  Dinner for Five @ Bayside Buffet = $ 150.000  Spa/Gym Accommodations = $ 35.00  I could not imagine why there were so many problems checking in, I kept thinking to myself that here we are going to spend more than $3000 on a room and they can't even follow through with the promises as set out with their reservations division. I spoke with several managers, after which they reassured me that things would improve. After two days of complaining, I had come to the conclusion that they would rather solve our problems than hear us complain the entire weekend.  www.cvbparty.com

Hit this spot on a Saturday, the music was pumping and the salespeople were on their toes. I needed a shirt for the evening's festivities, Tiffany was all answers and I walked out of the store with an English Laundry shirt and was feeling very satisfied.  I wish they had a MetroPark here in San Diego, but since they don't I will probably have to do my shopping at the San Francisco store.

Visited this place last time I was in Vegas. The sandwiches are quality and the menu is quite creative. Next time you are in Henderson, please look this place up - it is worth the search.  A pastrami sandwich, filled with cheese and cole slaw. Yum.  Bring cash - No CC

We came here before we went to the SF v Arizona game, we decided to walk from our hotel wow ~ was it hot. I tend to sweat and boy was I melting as we made our way past Arizona State Law School's campus.   The woman who was handling the seating and waiting arrangements did a great job engaging the crowd, despite it being 100 degrees outside their restaurant. It was a Sunday and it seems as though everyone in the historic district had the same idea as we did.   Food was good, came out quickly. Only thing that I was not too happy about was the iced coffee that they offered me and my wife. It seemed too watered down, to a point where my server asked if I wanted more iced tea. Besides that we had a good time service was attentive, Never mind that we were decked out in our best 49er apparel, they still treated us like very nicely.   I had the peppered bacon and the 'world famous' waffle with real maple syrup. (You can really put the words 'world famous' in front of anything.)  Definitely a must if you are in the area and you are looking for a brunch.

Had dinner here with the wifey and two of our very close friends, only steps away from the Westin Phoenix and the place is very welcoming.  Food: Pretty good and being a sushi self proclaimed aficionado I was impressed. Pure purple rise which I normally have when having Korean was their staple.  Ambiance: Casual and the staff were friendly.  Food Tidbit: Juno the head chef offers fresh wasabi on his sashimi - which caught us by surprise.   If you happen to be in Downtown Phoenix, you won't be disappointed.   Funny Tidbit: The restroom is farther away than you would expect, after a few doors and arrows - I laughed as the waitress said it was a mile away.
