Ok ........... Was not to happy with the food .  Got the all grass fed burger .  The bun was dry and the hamburger patty was ok .  For what I got here I could have gotten the big Mack at McD's  Then they had to place us were there family's and kids that can't act right .  Service a little slow . But that expected on a busy night.  My wife got a drink that was skinny Rita that was like salt rocks drink . Tons of salt at the bottom of the drink .  The Manager was kind enough to to take off the drink .  This is the second time in an issue with outback this year . The first one was terrible. And I was really hesitant to come here tonight  but it was paid for by a gift card .  However????? The light of my date with wife was the New York Cheesecake...  I forgot all about the bad . That's until I got way to full from all the water I drank....  Will I come back ?  Food no  Cheesecake.. Heck yes !

Ok I'm still a fan of hole in the wall places . This place is not really , hole in the wall place . But if there a middle class hole in the wall place this would place would be it ..  The food was freaking awesome !!  My wife even like the pork ribs and beans .  Let me say this , my wife hates pork ribs and beans .  They have the ghost BBQ sauce , that is freaking HOT if you just keep eating it .  I'm not a fan of BBQ rub , but this place is good with the rub .  We will come back for sure .
