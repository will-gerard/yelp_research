They are quick, efficient and do a great job. They have called to let me know material of clothing was not made to maintain the cleaning process well an different to not charge for those items, they have called to let me know items are ready early, they can get every stain out and are really nice.  They also discount for recycled hangers.

No matter where or when this restaurant is always great for a simple meal. Something for every mood on the menu and everything is always good.  You can be as healthy or glutinous here. It's all there.

Neat discovery!  Adorable and unique clothes and lots of Michael Stars tops.  They also have a lot of very reasonably priced cute jewelry.  The name is pretty misleading because the clothing they sell is really not exercise wear it is more for being out and about.  The woman who works here was very nice too.

This is a great steakhouse. Consistent in each of their locations. The one in Kierland is no exception. Excellent meal and great service. Wonderful steak and seafood.

Reasonable prices, great service, unique and delicious rolls.  This one is also in a great location right in Kierland Commons.  I consider myself very picky when it comes to sushi and this is a place I am very appreciative of having recommended to me.  I am a true fan of RA!

I had been a regular here and placed fairly decent sized take out orders weekly. The food is always good although they don't always get substitutions right. Since substitutions are sometimes about allergies that isn't super.  Anyway, I had not been here in a few months because I got really tired of how terrible the young girls taking the orders over the phones were. I decided I would give it another chance and called tonight around 4:30 to place a take out order. I gave Whitney my name and was about to place my order when I was asked if I could hold. 5 minutes later I was still holding and I hung up.  Management, train your employees on customer service. I doubt I am the only business you are losing!   It's really sad too when you love a restaurants sushi but the employees can't take a take out order and treat customers properly at off hours.  Guess next time I'm craving RA I will be driving to old town. Hopefully they are managed better and value their customers their.  Bye bye Kierland. Too many fails for the least acceptable reason.

This is the oldest AJs around. Decent selection but doesn't stock a lot of the quality items I go to AJs for. Also the appearance of this store doesn't seem to earn it the right to charge AJs prices. Not impressed with this location.

Dr Brown is one of the best vets in the world without question. The staff here are so kind and Dawn is the greatest tech ever.  They are so caring, and great at picking up on things.  Stephanie is a great groomer too. I highly recommend this place to any pet owners in Scottsdale.

I hadn't been to Kohls in years and I either forgot what a dump it was or it's declined over the years. Regardless it was a huge disappointment and I will be going to Steinmart for these needs for now on.

They are not the friendliest and are not cheap but it's a nice looking nail place in a great location with a lot of really good nail techs. Unfortunately they use old polish that should be thrown out and bubbles up when it dries. I really like this place but after being a regular for 2 months and getting bad polish twice I'm going to be forced to explore other options. Who wants bubbles on their nails???  Bad practice.

My experience here Dr Hollis Underwood should thank me that I have only written negative complaints to her directly and now in yelp. The experience I had here would be worthy of a complaint to the medical board.   I called to make an appointment to establish myself as a patient the Monday after Labor Day and was in need of an urgent visit as a follow up from an ER visit after a car accident. The first available appointment was December 3rd.   I was forewarned that Dr Underwood doesn't limit her time with her patients to the 15 min insurance companies allow her to bill for and therefore requires her patients pay an additional $150 a year. On the phone I was told I could decide to pay this fee after my initial visit but that wasn't what happened when I got there.   There was a terrible wait. Then I wS taken back for some preliminary tests and brought back out to wait some more.   I was given really unnecessary tests for someone in their 30s such as a bone density test, EKG and the list goes on.   Dr underwood was eager to diagnose me with several severe diseases none of which I even had adequate symptoms to consider an adequate concern she was dying to give me a Pap smear but I had seem my Gyno for my annual well woman exam the day before so that too was unnecessary.   Her staff for the most part were short and abrasive and her scare tactics were disgusting and unappreciated.   Most outrageous was that she ordered tests be sent to me to do at home and send back without ever discussing them with me. Unacceptable!!!  She doesn't contract with reputable medical facilities like medical imaging and instead has a mobile unit out of another state come to her office monthly. WTF???  When I voiced my concerns to her in writing there was not even an attempt to apologize or clear up any confusion. She was simply happy to keep my $150 and who knows what she was collecting from my insurance and let me move on to the next doctor.   I did immediately seek a second opinion and all of her serious concerns were found invalid at Scottsdale Healthcare.   I always enjoyed the prizes in Cracker Jax boxes myself but I prefer my doctors licenses carry more credibility than the cracker Jax prizes.     Run, don't just walk away from this one and see any other doctor instead.

This was the best body shop I ever dealt with. They are so nice and incredibly efficient. They even finished my repairs early. Usually I get one prediction of how long it will take and see my car agsin weeks later. Here I was told a month and it was about 3 weeks.  Adam was the best. Everyone should use this place.

The only reason I am not giving this hotel 5 stars is because it is so far out there. I has no idea how big Scottsdale was until I discovered how far this hotel is from everything.  Once you do get there is is a Four Seasons at its finest. Great rooms, great restaurant, staff that bends over backwards, 24 hour room service. Movie rental, extra phone chargers, great gift shop and beautiful grounds.  As long as you don't mind the drive it's among one of the best hotels in town. They even allow dogs :)

Awesome decor, great service, hidden gem in Scottsdale. Delicious and unique menu. The lamb fondue was so great, the trout, salads and chicken. Interesting bread basket with an assortment of muffins and breads and a diverse dessert menu. They need something a bit more chocolate on it ;) Great place!  One of the best restaurants I have been to in Scottsdale!!!

This is the best AJs I have been too. Great selection!  Far superior to the others in town. More items in stock. More helpful personnel and even more sales.  Amazing seafood selection!  Mini pharmacy I haven't seen in any of the other stores.  Thank goodness this store has more than 2 cases of each soda weekly. Great selection of Mrs Meyers cleaning products. Great bath products.  This one is the farthest from me but will become my go to store none the less.

Save your money and go to the freezer section of your local grocery store. Some of those are far tastier.  You can call yourself NY all you want but no one in NY would ever eat this distasteful cardboard.

I have stayed at all the top resorts in the area and without question Sanctuary is my absolute favorite!  The spa suite rooms are so amazing (as long as you like modern) and the beds are so comfy.  The staff bends over backwards even on the simplest things.  The views of Camelback are amazing and it is a very central location.  I'm done exploring hotels in the area, I found a winner!

Great place to see in Scottsdale. Learned a lot about Frank Lloyd Wright and saw a beautiful and interesting place.  Check the tour times ahead of time. The wait between tours can be a little long if you get there at the wrong time. Great to find some real first rate culture amidst Arizona life. Truly a special place.

One of the best burger and beer spots around. I had been to the one in San Francisco a few years ago so when I saw this one I knew it would be an excellent lunch spot.  Great burgers, excellent beer selection, very nice servers and good fast service. Absolutely nothing bad can be said about this place.

This is the worst overpriced Chinese ever. Authentic, overlooked, tough, extra fatty, cheap cuts of meat and not very good service. Place was empty and they couldn't have rushed me more.  Offered me rice, then charged me $4.35 for it!!! Huh??? I would highly recommend going hungry over trying to eat this terrible overpriced food.

Made a reservation for 7:15pm. Got there at 7:20. Was super loud!!!! Was told I could be seated and then given a pager and told it would be a 5 minute wait. 30 minutes later I still wasn't seated and I gave back the pager and left. WTF?  Why make a reservation if it is meaningless??? I'm over overrated noisey overpriced Fox restaurants. Bye bye

Great central location for meeting up with friends all over the area.  Wonderful food and reasonable prices. The happy hour deals are particularly amazing.  Had 4 really delicious fish tacos that were as good as the best of places in California and they were $6.   AMAZING cocktails!  The Whipped one, I forget the name, was the best drink I have had in a long time!   Bartenders are really helpful and friendly.

Was a big fan of Mastros steakhouse so as soon as I heard about the Ocean Club I had to try it. I'm so glad I did. It is a wonderful restaurant. The cold seafood tower is delicious. The king crab and oysters were so fresh. The salads are so good, such great choices and unique variety. Great cocktails, wonderful bread, incredible service and the desserts are yummy too. Great central location in Kierland. Highly recommend this one for anyone is Scottsdale.

The 2nd star is for being open so late. The food is overpriced and not good at all. Meats were fatty and too well done. The shu Mai was not edible.   To further annoy me, not only were all the BBQ meats fatty and too tough to eat, when I was starving, but I was asked when I ordered if I would like rice with it?  I assumed in typical Chinese restaurant style this meant it came with it so I said yes and was then charged $4.25 for it.  Are you kidding me? The shrimp dumplings were the only thing that was good.  I would never ever again come here for this overpriced terrible food.

Moved here from LA after seeing the same colorist for over 7 years. I was terrified to try someone new after so long with the same person and I have found the transition easy, stress free and been happy with the results here. Both Ryan and Tyler have done a great job on my hair.  Ryan is a great colorist, stylist and Tyler also does great updos. Really nice guys too.  Great location and great selection of products. Almost a year now and never anything but good experiences here.  I highly recommend.

They keep trying to be a top notch gym but they just cut too many corners to ever get there. The pool is really nice but it is salt water Blech!  The customer service needs improvement. Very few classes and most have an extra charge. I dunno but I would rather pay a little more and get the experience and quality I deserve at Village!  Do they do anything else here?  Yeah kids are running around all summer making it crazy crowded and there is no warmth to this place with or without kinder land.  Many better wats to spend your money in town!!!

The service is amazing!  Great selection of drinks and the bartenders are really skilled mixologists. The bartenders are really friendly and personable, especially Ken and Greg, they are my favorites!  The drinks are great and the food is good too, especially the shishito peppers.   They have some great Happy Hour specials. My favorite is Tuesday, $2 oysters.  The drink and food menu changes from time to time but they will still make the drinks from older menus.  Great views and it's a very relaxing atmosphere.  One of the classier spots in town!  Easy to forget where you are and the bar stools are pretty comfortable too. Outdoor seating is nice when the weather allows a person to want to sit outside.  I highly recommend!!!

This bar has a great ambiance to it.  Very classy look and feel and seems sophisticated for Scottsdale/Paradise Valley.  It is easy to feel like you are on vacation when you are here even if you live locally.  Great mix of customers between locals who love the spot and hotel guests so lots of opportunities to talk to interesting people.   The cocktails are great and pretty unique.  The bartenders are such nice guys and great mixologists.  The prices can be a little steep when it isn't happy hour and the happy hour offerings are slim.   Great outdoor seating! The bathrooms are disgusting for a place of this level.  You can smell the urine when you turn the corner out of the bar and the floor is often wet or stalls are out of order.  It is also strange because all other hotels of this level have wash cloths in the rest rooms and here they have an upscale napkin.  I don't really care what variety hand towel I get but the lack of cleanliness is disappointing.  Its pretty tough to spend quality time at a bar without visiting the rest room.

I have been here a few times since and I love the beignets!  The duck fat fries that they serve in place of bread are AMAZING. The service varies, I have had amazing wait staff and disappointing wait staff for a restaurant on this level. It seems to be the luck of the draw but the food is wonderful if you are willing to splurge on cost.

I love the grill here but it's rarely open. The weekend morning omelette bar sounds amazing but everytime I come to try it out there is a sign on the door saying sorry no omelette bar today.  They stock some great things that I can't find at other stores but stock is always low. Would you believe the only get 2 cases of each soda weekly?   I don't find the customer service on par with the prices at all and I frequently notice produce that is moldy or bad on the shelf. I have a feeling the best thing that ever happened for this store was the local whole foods closing. However time and time again this AJs disappoints me.

This is my favorite breakfast spot!  The menu is so diverse and the food is delicious.  The Bloody Mary's and coffee are good too.  They also open early which is nice.  too many good breakfast spots don't open early enough to be breakfast and not brunch. I have yet to come here for any other meals or to enjoy the drinks that look incredible but I will soon :)

Had some wonderful meals here when I stayed at The Phoenician. Wonderful food. I had the most delicious oysters one night and a wonderful seafood platter another night. The best version of a wedge salad I have ever had was here. They have great drinks too and the waiters and bartenders were all wonderful.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are staying at the hotel or just near Phoenix.

Great selection of flavors!  They even have doggie frozen yogurt. Score!!!  I have seen many of these serve yourself places that seem pretty lacking in cleanliness and sanitary and Yogurtology is definitely clean and well maintained.  Butterfinger is my absolute favorite flavor but oatmeal cookie, cake batter, salted caramel and chocolate malt are all very good. This is probably not as good a yogurt shop for fruitier flavors but it has a great variety and some very interesting options for toppings.  Only negative is sometimes the wait at the register seems long whether anyone is in front of you or not and the staff aren't always out there for if you want to sample flavors.  I love this place. Great hours too.

This hotel was a very disappointing experience. I like to travel with my dogs and Vdara advertises being dog friendly. I called them before I made any reservation to get detailed information on their pet policy.   They told me that they provide dishes and crates for the dogs so I wouldn't have to bring my own.   I drove there so I could have easily brought my puppy's cage and dishes for my dogs. However, since I was told I wouldn't need either I didn't bring any of them with me.   After I checked in, exhausted from my long drive 2 tiny crates arrived at my room. The hotel says up to 2 dogs combined weight per room 70lbs. The crates they brought were too tiny for my 43lb Springer and my 30lb puppy could be crammed in but couldn't lay down or sit comfortably.   They delivered blankets, a bisquit and a room service menu but no baggies as promised and no bowls. So I called downstairs 4 times to get no answer and went down to speak to them finally. I was told they only had paper dishes and no larger crates.   Obviously the paper dishes are not so reuse able with water and difficult to clean from food too so I had to ask for a new set the following day and didn't even get real dog dishes, no attempt was even made to give a a real bowl from room service.   Then my second night the puppy got stuck in the tiny crate and suddenly 2 different size larger crates appeared at my door after being told many times that they had nothing larger.   My dogs were dying of thirst the entire stay and everytime I needed to feed them was a project. This was not relaxing!  It was frustrating and some of the hotel staff were apologetic but most couldn't be bothered helping me with the dogs needs.   If you can't make proper accommodations you should not call yourself pet friendly!  I was charged a fee for having the pets but not given the necessary accommodations for them as promised.   Very frustrating.   I also got no bell service at check out and the valets were not helpful with my bags loading up my car when I had 2 dogs in my hand too.   The beds were not comfy either and all around Vdara was a HUGE disappointment.

Great hike!  Love doing the gateway loop trail. This is a great hike because it's not too crowded and it's moderate level. Another bonus is that the bathrooms are really clean and parking is easy.  Looking forward to doing the hike to Tom's Thumb one day too.

Just got food from here for the first time and it is AMAZING!!!  Just don't plan on being healthy if you come here, this is purely authentic Philly comfort food. All that is missing is Rita's, which isn't too far away :)  I loved this place so much that with all the negative reviews on here I am left wondering if we all went to the same place???  First off I got my food through Grubhub (delivery). It actually was much faster than the predicted delivery time and the delivery person couldn't have been nicer. Only one complaint is that the pizza was cold but that's the beauty of delivery is that I was able to remedy that pretty easily.  The pizza was the closest to real NY pizza that I have had here. The crust could have been a tad crunchier but it was delicious. Also loved that I could get just one slice like NY to make sure I liked it without being stuck with an entire pie.  The Pretzels are exactly like what you get in Philadelphia.  Because it was delivery and there is a $10 minimum I also ordered a small cheesesteak that I have not had yet because how much can a person eat at once?  I'm not a fan of Whiz so I opted for the make your own and got beef (no self respecting person with Philly roots really gets chicken) and I got provolone, which is always my preferred chesesteak cheese. Since I haven't had the sandwich yet I can't comment on the amount of meat but I will update this after I have had it.  Also was excited to see they have the roast pork sandwich, another Philly food.  I can't imagine eating this often bc of the calories but anytime I'm feeling like indulging and having some great comfort food I am for sure coming here. This will also be where I get pizza for now on!!! Love this place!!!  If you have no Philly ties I think you can still enjoy this. Only problem is you may never be able to enjoy the food they serve elsewhere ;)

This hotel was once amazing but that was in the 90s and it hadn't been renovated since. :( The prices are high for an upper end hotel in this area and what you get for your money may be the least impressive of anything on its level.  I checked in and requested a room close to the main building and was given what was unquestionably one of the farthest rooms. I called and was then moved to a closer room but I was brought there via many service entrances and nasty back end corridors clearly for staff only.  The room was acceptable but not on par with the price point and level of this hotel. Guests I spoke with however made me think my room with dirty Starbucks cups on the balcony was one of the higher end rooms bc I was told of peeling wallpaper and insect infestation in other rooms.  Basically this hotel earned it's reputation a few decades ago and is still thriving off it bc what it is currently is hardly what one would equate with Waldorf Astoria name.

This place is overpriced, has a limited selection, the service is slow even when empty and they seat everyone on top of each other. Really really terrible. Highly re come d skipping this one.

This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.

They don't make whole wheat anymore:(. The pumpkin are cinnamon with a fancy name and even at times they are empty they undercook the pancakes. Gross!   Sadly it's the only place open after 9pm so I may have to return.

OMG this place is amazing. Some of the most unique and tasty quacamole and salsas. Really great dishes and the drinks looked fabulous, although I didn't have any.   One flaw was we were there for a birthday celebration and told them when we made our reservation and they did not acknowledge it in anyway.

Everyone in the practice is so kind and supportive from the women at the front desk, the MAs, the teachers and first and foremost Dr Primack.  It is tough to be overweight and it isn't easy to decide to take control and try to change your life and do the work necessary to make the needed changes and see the results And everyone here understands that and is behind you, there to help and support you and quick to let you know how much progress you are making.  Dr Primack is one of the kindest most caring doctors ever. He shares his own triumphs with his patients and has great motivational tactics as well as a terrific bedside manner.  Dr Primack is as down to earth and kind as a person could ever want a doctor to be.  This is a Rigorous program but changing ones life is never easy and these people make it as easy as it can be and show so much compassion and care.  Having seen lots of experts for weight loss and tried tons of diets I never knew it would be possible to see the results I have so far and really change my entire life.  I am so proud of my decision to take part in this program and I will be really sad when I hit my ultimate goal and don't get to come here every week and see Dr Primack every 2 weeks.  This is a wonderful place and it's not an easy program but it works and changes your life while transforming you.

This is a typical CVS with all the things you would expect at a CVS. It's a very central location and has a drive through which to this recently relocated city girl is really neat.   Where they excel is that the pharmacists are so helpful here. I'm fairly new to town and therefore have a new insurance plan that is a bit odd in what it approves and what it doesn't. They have been very helpful in my challenges for my allergy eye drops that are not covered, they offered possible other ways to get them and they looked up alternatives and costs.   Then there was a problem with my birth control pills bring given to me as generic when I prefer the formulary. I brought them back with no receipt but clearly unused or opened. They looked it up and oddly the formulary is free but the generic had a charge. I was refunded with no problem  There have been additional situations requiring more time and attention than usually needed with filling a prescription. Each time I have had different people help me and each time they have been very helpful, knowledgable and understanding. Kudos to the pharmacy staff here!  Also the front cashiers at this location are incredibly friendly. They always greet you as you enter and leave the store.   I never thought I would review CVS on yelp but this one is pretty impressive.

Great food, wine and service here. It's truly living up to being a Four Seasons establishment. Loved the squealing pig Sauvignon Blanc. Can't find it anywhere else but I continue to look.  Excellent food. Staff made great suggestions. Highly recommend.

This one is not as good as the one in Hayden. They have made mistakes on substitutions and do not seem to be as flawless with customer service. However it's a great central location to stop at if in the way home later at night and they still have great food just be careful if trying to substitute bc they may not be.

Great running store!  Anyplace with a treadmill to see how you run in the sneakers is a place I consider the right place to buy running shoes.  They have all the top brands and also know how to fit you properly for shoes. Really really nice and knowledgeable staff.  They have free group runs I'm excited to check out.  Great running shoe shop!  I do not think you should go anywhere else in the area.

This may be the worst Pizza I have ever had. The salads look like they are the same quality as Mc Donald's pre packed in plastic in a refrigerator case. Service is SLOW and this is really just another junky pizza place with marketing that is far better than the place it's self.  Go to Grimaldi's or Humble Pie instead. Even papa Johns is better.

Can't believe I haven't written this yet. Had a great meal here with my family when they were visiting from the east coast. There was a bit of a wait but we occupied our time at the nearby shops.  Very unique and delicious menu. We each had different things and all enjoyed our meals.  The staff were wonderful. The outside seating was great. My family can't wait to come back to town to come here again.

Loved this place. Small but unique and diverse menu. The restaurant has a really near look to it, the nicest public rest room I have ever seen and the servers bend over backwards to be accommodating. Parking is easy too and there isn't much of a wait.  This one definitely stays on my list of go to brunch spots.

Went here for a business lunch because True Foods had to long a wait. Menu was a decent lunch selection but service was VERY slow, although it was not crowded.  The burgers and fries looked good but my order was messed up and in the interest of te and since it was a business lunch I couldn't send it back. However when you ask for no dressing on a salad and balsamic vinegar on the side it's a pretty basic request and you should not get a salad soaked in sweet calories filled dressing. Boo on this place. Too many other choices in the quarter to return.

I had seen this restaurant in La Jolla for years but never made it in. I was excited to see one in Scottsdale Quarter so I could finally try it.  It is really good food but some rooms are better to be seated in and the service can be really slow.  Another plus is it is 1000 points on Open Table.

10 days ago I came in later on in the day needing a harness for my 10 week old puppy. This young girl was all about helping us and couldn't compliment the puppy enough.   I was leaning toward just a simple black one that was the cheapest they sell because they all seemed to be pretty unattractive. She was concerned he would outgrow it too quickly and she insisted he try on this harness that looked like a man's suit. It also happened to be their most expensive harness.   I had to agree with her when she put it on him that it was adorable and so I bought the significantly more expensive harness. All the way out the door she was admiring my puppy.   So it's gear for a puppy, it's got white on it and obviously it is going to get dirty. After a week I decided to throw it in the washing machine to clean it. There are no instructions on it not to wash it in a washing machine!  I take it out and it has basically fallen apart. Lose threads everywhere and the tie was loose and a piece came off.  Pretty frustrating!  So I took it back to the store and a man who had been there the night we were in totally remembered us. I explained what happened. He tried to help us but called the young girl over, I guess because he knew she had helped us initially.   She suddenly was way too busy to even admire my puppy who she didn't remember at all????  I was waiting for a good amount of time and then I saw her stocking food on the shelves. I caught her eye and she would not even acknowledge me.   She just kept trying to avoid me and her co worker had made it clear I was waiting to talk to her.   After about 20 minutes to a half hour I just left. Under any circumstances the customer service was garbage but given I had a specific situation I needed to talk to them about and there was no ability to even have the discussion at a time the store was empty I was and remain beyond annoyed. At least tell me you won't take it back but don't avoid me indefinitely...that is beyond rude!!!  I left and hell will freeze over before I ever enter that place again.  So many pet stores in the area that are delighted to speak with and help their customers I need not spend the tons of money I spend on my dogs at this place.   Bye bye to this garbage store! Look forward to reading about when you go out of business!!!

Great breakfast spot in Grayhawk. Love the banana quinoa pancakes!!!  Good service. Amazingly unique menu. Huge portions, so be prepared to share or take home leftovers.   This is my new go to brunch spot and I'm thrilled to find a place I love in North Scottsdale rather than old town.

They have a decent selection of things to meet all your pets needs and definitely excel is the better foods and treats. However this store is the most ridiculously overpriced store around. It hadn't taken me long to pick up on them being way overpriced but convenience had still won me over a few times.  Last weekend was it for me though!  My dog was at the emergency animal care and they told me to get him pumpkin so I ran here to make sure I would have what I needed for him when he got home.  For the fruitables cans they charged over $9 each. This seemed really high to me but I didn't have a lot of time and was happy to find what I needed so I paid the exorbitant price.  The next morning I checked out pet club across the street and they sell the exact same cans for $3.05 each. So I can get 3 cans there for every 1 here. I really felt frustrated I had paid the crazy price for the cans I bought here but this was my final straw that this store is highway robbery.  I'm thankful to have Pet Club so nearby with honest and fair prices to care for my dog properly.

I had been a huge fan of Humble Pie and sort of forgotten about it for a few months and was excited to go back again. However, I found the selection more limited than I remembered. Service is still excellent!  Pizza is still very tasty. Definitely a good staple for dining.  Quick with take out too and the food travels well.

This company is amazing!  I was moving from Scottsdale, AZ to Seattle, WA and needed to move within a week. Brandon got back to me right away, gave me a reasonable quote, asked for no money up front and had 4 guys with him on time the day we decided on to load.  His crew were the nicest and did an excellent job. A few minor snafus where Gary did the packing like a lightbulb was placed in my night table drawer with a heavy phone, alarm clock and remotes so I unpacked a broken bulb and had to deal with the mess. Everything else was flawless.   Brandon is really accommodating and his crew and him have a great rapport to really let the customer know they are in great hands.

Missed the Wizard of Oz part sadly but the lights and the installation set to music that I did see were Amazing. Loved the bears, penguins, turtles and giraffes.  Some of the bugs were as amazing as the animals and just the amount of lights and all the colors were beautiful. Definitely glad I made it to see this.

This is my favorite fast food burger spot around. They have some great healthier options like a multigrain bun, chicken sandwiches and salads. They easily have the best fries around too. Love the Smash fries and sweet potato fries. I just wish they stayed open a little later week nights.

So I have been to Nobu in a few different cities but haven't been in Vegas since this one opened. I'm not a big fan of Caesars but I was ready to stay here to stay at the Nobu hotel. Only problem was whether intentional or not the reservation agent on the phone pretty much talked me out of it. However, I still absolutely had to dine at the restaurant.   Love this place and the food is amazing at every location, no matter what you order but this one loses a star bc the bartender, although really nice was very aggressive about trying to get me to spend more money than I had hoped too.   First he mentions all these specials not on the menu and when I said I would try 1 he said it's either $80 or $120 depending on how I want it prepared. I guess I should be flattered that I looked so wealthy to him but it really was obnoxious.   After that anything I ordered or that he suggested I had to ask the price of and he still was dishonest with some house special roll that was supposed to be $30 something and on my check, which I didn't look at carefully until after I left I was charged $40 something.   He also made me a drink I didn't like bc he didn't want me to start with the drink I wanted too and charged me for the drink I didn't like or drink???  They were out of ingredients for 3 drinks I tried to order and basically for this level restaurant I was very disappointed with the service and selection.   I had to ask for a glass of water 3 times before getting it and for spending about $200, by myself I was not so impressed with the service I received. However I love Nobu so I'm sure I will be back anyway.

This is one of the fun signature pieces in Scottsdale. Similar to the giant Solari Bells at The Waterfront. Anything that adds a little color to the brown desert landscape is A OKay in my book.  This piece is fun because of how it is lit up at night too.

This is a very clean place and the prices are average for the area. Not the largest selection of colors but still it seems to cover a good array.  Seems to be a lot better to make an appointment ahead of time than to just walk in. I had an appointment but I saw others get turned away because they were too busy.  Only negative which I guess could also be a positive depending on where you fall. They are very loyal to their regulars. So I was sat down and given one tech who began my nails and I could tell she was good. Part way through one of her regulars came in and so she left me and someone not as good did the rest while the initial nail tech did her regular client.  Probably one of the better shops in N Scottsdale and definitely the best in Grayhawk, D.C. Ranch.

There are lots of good options for subs in Scottsdale but this isn't one of them. It has so clear die Hard fans and I read all these great reviews and was eager to try this place. Sadly it does not live up to its reputation. Very little meat on the subs and not great cuts of meat. I would equate the quality of Caprottis to Subway.

I have recently discovered that Kat and Michelle are not only the sweetest women with amazing talent when it comes to nails but they do a great job on hair too!   It takes a lot for me to trust someone new with my hair but looking at their hair color and seeing a few of their clients I was willing to trust Kat to do my roots, the first step :)  She and Michelle did a great job translating my color formula from a previous colorist and did an amazing job on my hair.  Soon I will be returning to let them do my highlights!   I am so excited that a friend discovered this place and recommended it to me because Kat and Michelle and wonderful and its nice to have a new place I can feel good about to take care of my hair and nails. Also if you haven't gotten the mood changing nail gels you are missing out on half the fun of the manicures here.

This is the best pet boutique I have found in Scottsdale. The owners are so nice and helpful. They have great products and the best selection of dog treats I have ever seen in one place, fresh doggie ice cream!  jerky made in PV, Stella and Chewy, gourmet cookies, gourmet cupcakes, and so much more.   Cute clothing for the tiny dogs, nice dishes, leads, collars, pet tags, and great toys.  Vince and Tony are the nicest shop owners ever and so helpful!  This is where everyone in Scottsdale with pets should shop.  I'm so glad I found the store!

Once again you messed up. When a person asks to not have items included such as onions or raisins it means they do not want them!!! Also ripe cucumbers are not soft and are not discolored. Yours consistently are both of these.  I have tried you many times but after this take out disaster I'm done with you Pita Jungle. You simply stink!!!

My favorite go to spot in Scottsdale!  The menu is unique, fresh and delicious. The service is always great and the menu changes often to make for great variety.  They have the most unique and tasty bread and butter if any restaurant I have ever been too.  I have enjoyed a variety of dishes here. I love their French fries and truffle ketchup, the mussels are good, lots of great salads and vegetable dishes, the sweet potatoes are wonderful, trout, pasta...I'm not sure I ever had a bad dish here.  The dessert variety isn't always great but the summer menu sure is!!! Highly recommend Binks!!!

Ok definitely the worst restaurant I have been to in Scottsdale!!!  The service is slow!!!! They messed up every single item we ordered. The restaurant had a terrible draft and the food was mediocre.  I would never ever go here again!  Many better options for Mediterranean food in Scottsdale. A definite add to the must miss list. Blech.
