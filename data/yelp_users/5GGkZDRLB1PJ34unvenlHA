Not a beautiful facility, but staff was excellent. Rebecca, the PA, had to deliver very disappointing news to me about a broken foot. She was empathetic about this, answered all my questions and presented the situation very thoroughly. I appreciated it. I did have to wait about an hour when I went to the urgent care on a weekday around 10 AM. Not sure if that is typical or not.

Excellent experience! Got a massage, mani and pedi. John was great for massage. Had Sharron for mani/pedi -- equally great.

Today, I tried Manuel's down the street because I finally lost hope that Tee Pee would one day get takeout right. I ordered the same thing at Manuel's that I typically order at Tee Pee. The takeout was 100% better. Crisp, neat and tasted fantastic. I'd recommend Manuel's over Tee Pee if you're looking for good takeout.

Tee Pee is pretty expensive compared to other similar restaurants. The food has been ok when I eat in, but I have been consistently disappointed with the takeout from Tee Pee. It is soggy, sloppy and tastes horrible. Today, I tried Manuel's down the street because I finally lost hope that Tee Pee would one day get it right.

I had a great experience getting a shellac manicure here. Bernice was fabulous. My only critique is that they only offer shellac, not gel. Also, the color if shellac I selected was not available, so I had to go with my second choice color.

Great food and wonderful environment. Sat outside on patio; very enjoyable. I had the chorizo brizza, breakfast parfait and OJ. (Yes, way too much food. I'm eating the rest of my brizza and parfait for dinner right now!) Highly recommend the brizza. So good!  Customer service was wonderful, too. I went inside to get a to go box, and was looking around for about 10 seconds. Before I had the opportunity to ask for one, I was approached by someone who worked there inquiring how he could help me.

Pretty pricey unless you go for happy hour, which we did. Lots of sushi roles at half price. Can't beat it. Goes until 6:30 PM on week nights.

Am I the only one who was totally disappointed with this place? I am a HUGE frozen yogurt fan. I've been driving out to Yogurtland in Scottsdale for my fro yo, but was excited about the new place (Zen Zen) opening up down the street. Tried it out tonight. All I can say is YUCK. I guess I was spoiled with my Yogurtland. Zen Zen was clean, yes. But, the selection was nothing like what was advertised on the website. When I finally did decide on just plain chocolate and vanilla, I was even more disappointed to find the frozen yogurt runny; not a consistency I'm used. It was way overpriced, too. I usually pack my cup at Yogurtland and rarely break $5. I spent $6 tonight on just over half of a bowl. Needless to say, I'll be making the drive out to Yogurtland in the future. :(

Good place for a cheap brow wax. Sucks because aestheticians move through there quickly. You can't get the same one for extended period of time. I like this place better than European Wax Center for sure.

Slowest Starbucks in the Valley! :( I never have enough time to go here before work. Sucks because it is the closest one to my house w/a drive thru.

I was seen at this facility today by my Banner Medical Group orthopedic surgeon. He rotates in here for clinic occasionally. I had an excellent experience. Facility was very clean. Staff I interacted with at registration and during my appointment were excellent. I'm going to look into switching primary care doctors and will likely move my primary care to this facility.

The barista was nice. Made an effort to speak with me (in passenger seat) when my boyfriend was drooling out the window. ;) Wasn't a fan of the coffee, though.

Very cute little place! It is an old home converted into a modern boutique salon. I went in for gel manicure and pedicure. It was the best mani pedi I have had in a long time. Going to switch over to this place for my brow waxes also.

Very cool place. Awesome industrial/modern design. Got the berry smoothie with whey protein boost. Tasty and not too sweet.

Love the new location! Don't go for happy hour, though. Not so happy. Very limited selection.
