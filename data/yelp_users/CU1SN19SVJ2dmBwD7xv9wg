I've been waiting in the will call line for over an hour. The staff is just silly emo hipsters who don't seem to care about their patrons. Get shit organized. I could stand this when I was 16, but there are some people who have expectations of a music venue. Plus my ass is sweaty. Which makes me angry.

Just went in for a tea latte (which are amazing!) and had to wait a bit... They weren't too busy but my drink had somehow fallen off their screen. I got lots of apologies, a larger drink than I had asked for, and a voided payment! I love you coffee bean!!!

Love this place! I used a groupon at drybar and had a horrible experience. I'm soo glad Primp and Blow blew them out of the water! My stylist actually took the time to ask me what I wanted in detail, was suuuuper sweet, and time sensitive for a dinner I was getting my hair done for. I got to look through Perez Hilton on an iPad when we weren't chatting and a short but amazing head massage during my shampoo. The manager also gave me a 10% off my next visit after I mentioned it was my birthday. Overall I would recommend this blow dry bar over any other place on town. I got major compliments on my hair that night!!!
