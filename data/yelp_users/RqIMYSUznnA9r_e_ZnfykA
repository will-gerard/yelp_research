I have been here twice and it is my new spot to go too for a haircut! I got the regular hair cut, and the manzillian the first time, and It was a fun experience! The staff is very friendly and consists of hair stylists and barbers! There are a few kinks in the store operation, but I have no major complaints. The retail part has "fun items," which are items you would find between urban outfitters and hot topic, kind of cool if you want that gag gift, or stocking stuffers!   My second experience was with Cassandra one of the hair stylist/barbers that opened up the place and I have to admit she cut my hair pretty dang well!  The bar side has $2 beers and wine and let me tell you ladies and gentleman; you can't beat that anywhere even in grocery stores!    Though I'm an ex retail Guy I think part of the kink falls on the point of sales side between bar and barbershop, I think there was an issue transferring tickets over. I could be wrong. The serivce was excellent and the bartender was really polite and helpful.  Stop by this place if you want to have an amazing experience and an awesome haircut!

My experience here was below average. I don't know how these guys have such high reviews, but I got my coffee about 10 minutes after it was ordered and there were only about 4 customers in the place at the time. I sat down prior and was told to move to another spot because they had a party of 10 coming in. I don't know but I felt that was a bit rude since I was there first and the full party had not arrived yet.   Coffee: below average wifi: weak.  Atmosphere: good Food: n/a
