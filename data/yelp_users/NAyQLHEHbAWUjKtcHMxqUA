This is a beautiful building! It was slightly confusing going here at first because there are two buildings and I was not sure which building my event was held in. Inside there are places to eat and there was plenty of room for the auto show.   For the purpose that it served I think it was great. I kind of doubt that my review will have any kind of negative or positive effect on whether people go here since we all mostly care about the event that is going to take place more than the venue.   I recommend going here if there is an event you're interested in because it is clean, new, and has close parking.

Came in on a Saturday evening to answer a pregnancy craving for the wife. Placed order at 5:41 and didn't get our order until after 7. The BBQ isn't that amazing especially compared to other places in the valley. While we were there three people elected to get refunds rather than wait for their order to be filled. When they asked for an explanation regarding the wait the guy up front shrugged his shoulders and apologized.   Again it's not mind blowing food and will definitely look elsewhere for BBQ before coming here in the future.

I love this place. My dad and I went here about 5 months ago and I have been here almost a dozen times since. I love the fish tacos. The place seems clean and the help is really friendly. They also have this green salsa that they bring out with the chips right at first that is really good! The surrounding area is rough but this is good!

Awesome! We come to the movies here and watch two movies for 12 bucks total!  It is a fun time and a cheap date. The announcer guy talks waaaay to much but that is the only problem.

I love this place. They are close to work and they serve the food in large portions. I have to get my hands dirty and they don't judge me when I use utensils to eat ribs. If you do use your hands though there is paper towel on the table that you are free to use. I would like to call on an artist that I like and I think his song illustrates what this place is all about.   Robert Earl Keen "Barbeque"  Ooh, when I was a little boy, only one or two First thing I did enjoy was a plate of barbecue  Barbecue, sliced beef and bread Ribs and sausage and a cold big red Barbecue makes old ones feel young Barbecue make everybody someone  If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do Treat yourself to some meat, eat some barbecue  Now there was once this girl I knew, she treated me so mean I offered her my barbecue, she licked my platter clean  Barbecue, sliced beef and bread Ribs and sausage and a cold big red Barbecue makes old ones feel young Barbecue make everybody someone  If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do Treat yourself to some meat, eat some barbecue  Now don't give me no broccoli or any Swiss fondue Baby, if you want to rock me, give me good ole barbecue  Barbecue, sliced beef and bread Ribs and sausage and a cold big red Barbecue makes old ones feel young Barbecue make everybody someone  If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do Treat yourself to some meat, eat some barbecue  Don't send me to Heaven, it ain't where I should go 'Cause the Devil's got a charcoal pit and a good fire down below  Barbecue, sliced beef and bread Ribs and sausage and a cold big red Barbecue makes old ones feel young Barbecue make everybody someone  If you're feelin' puny, you don't know what to do Treat yourself to some meat, let your feet hit the street Find a good place to eat, get some barbecue

When I was a kid in elementary school I had real dorky shoes. I hated it and I was teased a bit as a result. The problem was that cool shoes were never on sale where I lived and my mom only bought things that were a bargain. If famous footwear was an option (or if I was instilled with more self confidence) I would have been teased much less and would have enjoyed childhood more.  The service is great and they are very helpful. They have shoes that I want to buy and they are at prices that I don't mind spending the money. If you are looking to be cool and save dough then this is an acceptable choice.

I go to circle k because they are one of the few stations to carry diesel fuel in south phoenix. The help is nice enough but hobos are always there bumming for change and you don't really want to touch the door handles. The stores in south phoenix always seem a bit run down.

I love sacks and I also love the dirty puns I make when I go. The food is good the cookie they give you with each sandwich is good. I always get the symphony because I love anything that has avocado in it. I wouldn't recommend going at noon since it is PACKED. I also don't recommend the pasta or the pasta salad side. None of them are worth bragging about.

Walmart is bad enough as it is but this one is even worse. The people are gross and they hold up the lines all the time when their access cards malfunction. I go here when I have to and no more. Parking lot is also full of ungathered carts.

I have been a few times with my wife and by myself. I love it. It seems clean and the help is sincere and accommodating. The chicken is good and spicy!

I love QT. When I was on my mission in Spokane I always wished I could have a slushy or some other beverage but I always had to wait till I got home. Now I go all the time. They complete transactions lightning quick and have what I need. Every store has always been great in my experience. My only wish now is that they sold diesel.

So I was driving back from a work function when we decided that we weren't interested in going to work anytime soon. We thought ice-cream might be a good idea so we pulled up yelp and found this place.   I didn't spend a whole lot of time looking it over, and I really didn't need to since I saw in a review that it had bacon ice-cream. That was enough for me (who doesn't love bacon!?!?) so we headed there right away.   Now the location is good in the sense that it is around EVERYTHING on mill but it sucks if you just want to stop quickly. Luckily we did find metered Parking and were able to get in quickly. The rest of the ice-cream  was pretty basic.  they did have cinnamon and banana. The bacon ice-cream was good but I didn't settle on it.   I think it is a fun place to go and it was very good ice-cream. The service was great and they were very kind. I think though that it isn't THAT much better than cold stone. I think they had a great idea selling bacon ice-cream though, because that's what got me through the door...

I saw this place as I was driving down Broadway a few weeks ago and wanted to give it a try. last week I was able to for the first time and have been back twice more since! I love Hot dogs and sausage but there is not a place like that near by my work. This place is good because the dogs are already made. You can get in get your stuff and be done quickly.   The food was very tasty. I always get the itiallian sausage but I also tried a chicago dog as well and I loved that. The fries are sliced fresh there and they come with every order. If you like hotdogs and needs a place like that for lunch check it out.   This place is very clean and it smells good. If you work at University of Phoenix it is easy to get there and back wiith in 15 min. They are brand new and I want them to stay!

Not much to say that hasn't already been said. They have great sandwiches and funny signs on the wall. I would eat there again for sure. The diet coke was also really good for some reason.

The sign for Mixed Greens has been up for a few weeks and I have been eagerly anticipating the first time that I could go. Right now it is in a "soft opening" period where I guess they figure out what people in south phoenix like in a salad. For today I chose to get the Mango shrimp salad. It had a number of ingredients that I am a huge fan of. It had things like mango (duh) avocado, grilled shrimp (that I think they made right then) and Parmesan cheese. I am really enjoyed my salad. The dressing was tasty (I am not good at describing flavors) and a bit spicy and I ate the whole thing! It is of course brand new and so the help was incredibly friendly. They came around a few times checking to make sure that we enjoyed the food and that everything was too our liking. My wife ordered a rice bowl and it was a bit light on the sauce so he quickly brought out more! The tables were clean and it was a very open environment.   Here is the reality of this restaurant as I see it. In south phoenix we all complain a bit about the lack of choices as far as food is concerned. There are plenty of fried foods and Mexican places but nothing much after that. If you want variety and choice, supporting this place would be a great start. The food is good and the service is great. You can tell that they want to be successful by the efforts they make. If you like salad with unique flavors and awesome meats (like seared tuna, and steak) then you will probably like this place. If you don't eat here than I hope you eat dirt.

I was able to try out this place for the first time last Saturday. You walk in and you are a bit lost at first because you have so many choices as far as meats to choose from and what you can order. Hanging on the walls are a bunch of different kinds of cured meats that all look delicious but I didn't order any of those this time. My dad and I both ordered a polish sausage meal. His was the fresh polish and mine was the smoked polish sausage. They were both really good and we garnished with fresh sauerkraut. The sandwich was amazing! As I write this I am wishing I had time to go back today to try something different. I also plan on ordering some cured meats of some sort as well. A summer sausage or something spicy and tube shaped.
