Love this location because it is so close to my work. We stop by almost daily for a tea and perhaps a sandwhich or some amazing dessert! The ladies in the bakery are always so nice and now know us because we go there so much! So thankful for my refillable AJ's cup that their fabulous corporate office helped me track down. Love this place!

Enjoyed lunch with a coworker at Corbin's since it is just down the street from work for us. As soon we we walked in we were seated on the patio as we requested (it was a beautiful day) and our waiter immediately showed up to take our drink order. He came back quickly and mentioned the special for the day. I was impressed that their daily special menu include a specialty mac and cheese (today's was apple and smoked bacon mac and cheese).  After a few minutes of perusing the menu and asking a couple questions I settled on the lunch special that included soup and half a fajita chicken wrap. I went with the soup of the day (a creamy chicken tortilla) and requested the wrap with no onions. Our waiter told me the bell peppers and onions are already cooked together so I couldn't get it without which wasn't a big deal for me so I told him to go ahead and leave it as its.  Our food came out quickly after ordering which was impressive (we were on a lunch break so couldn't be gone too long) and we dug right in. The soup was fantastic! It was a cream based chicken tortilla with loads of chicken, beans, corn and a garnish of avocado and tasty tortilla strips. The wrap was also fantastic. Chicken, red peppers, green peppers, lettuce, tomato, and yes, those onions. But the onions were very small and cooked well so I honestly did not notice them!  Our waiter provided great service and checked on us frequently to refill our drinks. Once we finished he prompted delivered our checks and we requested to-go drinks. He prompted brought them out and we left. Our lunch was about a hour which I think is great for a sit down restaurant.  I will be back for sure.

This place is totally amazing! Came for lunch with some coworkers for my first time and was blown away. The moment I walked in I was overwhelmed with the most delish smells that filled the restaurant. I was also pretty happy because even thought it was the lunch hour, the place wasn't packed or too busy. Loved the different choices available: pizza, salads, sandwhiches, or soups. After quite some time staring at my options, I decided on half pesto chicken sandwhich and the tortilla soup and an iced tea.  I was surprised at how fast the food came out, yet how fresh and fabulous it was! The sandwhich was great, grilled pesto chicken on fresh ficotta bread. The soup was a tiny bit spicy and filled with pieces of chicken and veggies. I was blown away by the face that their iced tea is brewed from loose leaf teas...I am a little bit of a tea snob so this was a very nice surprise!! My coworkers got salads which I was tempted by and a little bummed I didn't get one after I saw theirs. You have a choice of one of their salad concoctions or mixing up your own. The choices of salad mixings is awesome to say the least! Next time I will try one of those for sure! I am very happy this place is close to work and will be coming back for sure!

I would give this place 0 stars if it was at all possible...  Went there a few weeks ago to meet some friends to watch some preseason football. Out waitress was nice, the food was good, and the beer was cold. It was a good experience till the 4th quarter...  The table in front of us had a female drinking a beer who was standing for a bit blocking our view. Finally, after a few minutes out friend leaned over to their table and asked nicely if she could sit so we could see the game. She responded, "I work here" and gave us a dirty look. Really? And? What does that have to do with the fact that we couldn't see?   She was clearly not working at the moment (she was holding a beer and an unlit cigarette) and asking her to sit seemed like a simple request. She sat and began talking about our table to her friends who were with her. Our waitress stopped by to see if we needed anything and as she walked away the "standing girl" pulled her aside. We watched her talk and point at our table to our waitress and when we made eye contact she flipped us off. Yes, she literally told us she worked there and then flipped us off! I have never been so disrespected as a patron of a restaurant!  Furious now, we asked for a manager and he came over. We told him what happened and he apologized for her and said he would talk to her. A few minutes later she came back over and sat at her table proceeded to talk about us again. Finally the manager told her to leave. He came back to our table to let us know that she had been drinking, he asked her to leave and would be talking to her when she was sober.   Just to confirm I wasn't crazy or overreacting, a woman at an uninvolved table came by ours after it was over and told us she watched the whole thing and was on our side. She couldn't believe that an employee would be so rude and flip us off.   I guarantee I won't be back for anymore football games or anything else. I will not give a dime to a restaurant that employes people who think it is ok to disrespect patrons regardless of it they are on or off the clock.

Went to Humble Pie for a laid back Valentine's Day dinner with my husband and it was fantastic. We made reservations because we assumed Valentine's day would be packed (and it was). We were immediately seated even though we arrived 20 minutes earlier than our reservation and our server stopped by shortly with waters for us and asked for our drink order. A friend recommended their red wine blend to me but didn't know what it was called. I asked the waitress if she knew which one my friend was talking about and she immediately pointed out the correct one on the menu. I am so happy I ordered it! It was fabulous (Murietta in case anyone is wondering) and a great compliment to my dinner. Anyway, they had a Valentine's day special (1 app, 2 salads, 1 pizza, 2 cookies) so we started with the cheese and meat board for our app. It was fabulous - 3 cheeses, 3 meats, fresh bread, olives, and tomatoes. Delish! Next we both ordered the chopped salads which were super fresh and very tasty! Then we got the pepperoni pizza and it was awesome. By thing point we were stuffed and could only eat half of it! We took the other half of the pizza and our cookies to go.  We had a great experience and great food. We will be going back.

Bruschetta is amazing here! I have tried almost all the different options with my girlfriends and I don't think I found one I didn't like! Their artichoke dip is also fabulous! I haven't tried anything else really because I am so hooked on the bruschetta Glasses of wine and pitchers of beer at $5 before 5!

I have now been here 4 times and can't say enough good things. My first time was right before my wedding as a gift from a bridesmaid and I was booked with Emma who is fabulous! I have been going to her since then and she always makes me comfortable during each appointment. The place is very clean and nice. I love the wax they use because there are no strips involved! I recommend this place to my friends!

Went on a Saturday night for a last minute meet up with some friends.  First, free valet there is awesome. So thankful that I don't have to drive around looking for somewhere to park.  We ate earlier so just ordered some drinks at first. Our friends, however, had a lovely spread before them. BBQ wings, hummus, and some sandwhich (not sure which). They had never been to the Vig but were quite happy with the food and ate almost everything. They loved the baba ganoush so much that they asked for more along with more pita bread. The waitress want nice enough to bring another helping.  Our friend wanted to try another wine, she asked the waitress to suggest something a little dryer. I was impressed because the waitress was able to suggest an alternative that my friended ended up loving. She was well versed in their wine which was fantastic! As our first group of friends left and we got a text from a group of girl friends that were just arriving so we decided to stay. They all ordered a Take Bethany Home and let me try. It was pretty delish and definitely unique! It is a blend of cucumber vodka, watermelon puree, fresh lemon, and agave nectar. Who knew cucumber vodka would be good. My Irish husband was over the moon because Jamison was on special whe month of March because of St. Patty's day so he got a shot of the 12 year to sip on and by this time we were hungry so we ordered the bbq wings we had seen our friends eating. They were fantastic, great flavor and a little spicy. I didn't even put ranch on them! Very good As far as the night atmosphere at this location it was very low key. I was surprised because the other vig gets very crowed. The Uptown location was full of patrons but not so full that you couldn't walk around of find a seat. We even managed to get the bocce ball court for a bit. I am going to go to for brunch one day for sure!

One word: Delicioso!   You gotta try it! All the ingredients are fresh and everything is made to order. The restaurant has a cool modern look and very clean. The staff is always friendly and happy to make suggestions. They will even offer you a sample of their daily soups if you're interested (and trust me, you are).   Be patient while they make your food. It doesn't take too long, but the chef it making it fresh for you right there chopping and grilling it up. It takes longer than similar restaurants, but trust me, it's well worth the extra few minutes (like maybe 3 extra, be patient).  Since you have 3 extra minutes to kill, check out their little garnish bar -- salsa, avocado sauce, radishes, carrots. Everything a traditional taco stand would have! Pick a few to try.   The Paquime salad is gigantic. It's piled high in a nifty lookin' bowl. Beware, the dressing has a bit of a kick -- it's not so spicy you can't eat it, but the spice builds with each bite. But it is so tasty you probably won't be able to stop eating it anyway.   The street tacos are simple perfection. I've personally had the ribeye and their are flavorful and juicy. Add a little salsa, their avocado sauce, or a squirt of lime. I'm drooling all over my keyboard...  And when you are done get dessert. No better way than to end the meal with some of their amazing traditional Mexican desserts. But don't take my word for it, once you see the cakes, pastries, and ice cream there is no way you can pass them up.
