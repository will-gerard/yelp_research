Awesome family owned business for quality trophies, awards, and printed t-shirt at a reasonable price! The owners are friendly and very helpful. If you have questions or need help with picking out stuff, they will show you the best options for your budget. I had ordered some shirts from Thunderbird Trophies for my classmates and I for our graduation. We are very happy with them. The turn around was fast and got done right in time before my graduation week. Thanks Joey and Michelle!

I love the fact that this Bath & Body Works is located in a quiet and peaceful outdoor shopping plaza. It makes it easy for me to get in and out without having to deal with the crowd like the ones at the mall. They have great selections of different items and always have my favorite scents in stock. Most of the staffs are friendly and helpful. When I am in need of more hand soaps, candles, and the Wallflower fragrances, this is the only location I come to. Easy in and out.

Maria Elena is the only person that I trust to wax me! She is the absolute best and I will never go to anybody else...unless she moves which I hope she won't! She always make sure that I'm comfortable and at ease. Super duper great service every time. Very friendly and professional! I highly recommend booking with Maria Elena. You won't regret it!

The hubby and I come here once a month for my pho cravings, his fried rice, and the egg rolls. It is located in a seedy looking location but we don't mind since the food is good and affordable. Avoid coming here during prime time (lunch and dinner) because service is very slow even though there seems to be a lot of people working at those times.

This was my first time at Joe's Crab Shack. I came here with several of my classmates to celebrate our last day of clinic and school. We had reserved a big table for 14 people and they were able to accommodate us which was great. The reason for my 2 stars is because of the service. It took forever for us to order and get our drinks and food. I know that we had a big table but there were two staff members taking care of us. The waitress was great but the waiter was super slow and had forgotten about us our something because one of my fellow classmate and I had ordered some alcoholic beverages and it took him 20 minutes to check up on us and asked if we wanted anything else and I was like umm yeah...our drinks! I have to say my Bloody Mary was delicious though so my annoyance for the delay disappeared. The food was okay. I had ordered The Ragin' Cajun to share with my friend. It was a little bit too salty for me but squirting some lemon juice on top made it taste better. Overall Joe's Crab Shack was okay. I don't think I will be coming back. I'll get my seafood fix somewhere else.

I come to this Target just to avoid the long lines and the ghetto people from Walmart down the street from my house in Laveen since it's the closes one to me. Seems like they're always out of stock on the things that I need now. I used to like coming here but this Target location is starting to become as ghetto as the Walmart in Laveen and the bathroom is disgusting and stinks like crap!! Yuck! I would hold my pee if I was you unless you're a guy and are able to stand up peeing.

This Z'Tejas location is my favorite out of all the other ones. The staffs here are always friendly and helpful. Love their corn bread which is always fresh and hot out of the oven. I always order their street tacos as an appetizer to share. They're tasty and yummy! So far everything that I have tried on the menu has been delish. No complaints on the service or food yet. The only thing that I didn't really enjoy was my strawberry mojito. It had no flavor and was watered down. All I could taste was the watered down alcohol and mint leaves. I've had way better mojitos elsewhere. I will be back to try their margaritas next time.

Love this park! Nice, peaceful, and clean! Perfect for walking, jogging, or biking. I work close to this park so it's easy for me to get my jogging on right after work if I don't feel like heading to the gym. People are friendly and always smile and say hello when you pass them by. If you're feeling stress and need a breather, go walk around the Scottsdale Green Belt and get some fresh air. You will get your daily dose of exercise and feel way better! :)

I've been coming here for a while since I used to work down the street from Urban Beans. I fell in love with their iced chai tea latte. It's not watered down or flavorless like some of the other coffee shops. It's flavorful and yummy in my tummy with just the right amount of spices and herbs, the way chai tea is supposed to taste like. They also have a great patio to just sit back, relax, and read a book.

I would give zero stars for this place! The fries at this Carl's Junior is disgusting that I wouldn't even feed them to the birds! I waited 10 minutes in the drive through for my freaking food and they still gave me stale ass fries! Never ever coming to this nasty place again! Stop hiring dumb teenagers that don't give a crap about the quality of your food!

Haha....just kidding. Thumbs down for this location!!!! Hmmmph!

Hubby and I were craving donuts so we decided to go get some. We've heard of Bosa Donuts but have never been to one before so we stopped by this particular location since we were in the neighborhood. We ordered half a dozen of different donuts to share. The hubby and I liked the custard filled one and my mom loved the coconut one we bought her. It would of been better if the donuts were warm but overall it was good and we would come back again.

Came here with some friends for dinner after work. I had high hopes for this place but I knew when I walked through that door that I shouldn't expect the food to taste like true authentic Thai food. I wanted to give it a try anyways because one of my co-worker loves this place and recommend that I come here. Right away you can tell it used to be a Wendy's fast food joint and the drive through window is still there. The place was nice and clean inside and the low lighting with the candles on the tables make it feel more intimate and romantic if you were on a date. They give you cucumber water which I absolutely enjoyed since that is how I drink my water sometimes at home. I wanted to try their Mango Mojito but they couldn't make it so I ordered the Holly Pop. Let's just say that I didn't like it whatsoever. It was too sweet and tasted weird to me so I barely touched it.   On to the food! I started with the Coco Soup and the Pad See-iew as an entree both with medium spice level. What can I say? The Coco soup was sour, salty, and creamy from the coconut milk but it was missing something. You can tell it didn't taste authentic. The Pad See-iew was a little bit too sweet and I couldn't taste any spice so I added more chili sauce. I also tried my friends food. One ordered the Avocado Curry, the other ordered Sweet Curry, and the last one ordered the Pad Thai. The Avocado Curry was actually quite tasty and flavorful. The Sweet Curry was bland and lack flavor. The Pad Thai was way too sweet and soggy. It was drowned in sauce or oil as you can see in my pic. Not appetizing at all. We ordered the fried bananas and ice cream to share for dessert. The bananas were wrapped like egg rolls and smothered with chocolate syrup. The outside was soggy and didn't taste like it was freshly made.   Overall I don't think I will be coming back to this restaurant unless my friends drag me here by my hair. I'm used to home cooked authentic Thai food with robust flavor and spices so if that's what you're looking for then I wouldn't recommend coming here.

I've been coming here for a while now and have never been disappointed. Service is always great and the food remains delicious and flavorful. I always order their beef sticks which is tender and full of flavor. The hubby loves their bai cha which is fried rice. It has the same meat on top as the beef lol lak which is another dish that I like to order from here. Whenever I'm too busy to cook Khmer food at home, I come to Sekong to eat.   The only problem I have is with the parking, there is no valet! What's up with that?! Lol...just kidding.

One of my favorite places to stop by during the hot and scorching summers of AZ. You can't go wrong with getting some snoh to help cool you down. They also have milk teas and ice teas to quench your thirst. Glad that they brought snoh into the desert so that I don't have to drive to Cali just to get some.

One of the worst Paradise Bakery in the valley! Dingy and unclean. Customer service is nonexistent. Yes I'm here for food so get your lazy butt away from your conversation or phone and help me so that I won't get hangry at my hubby! Is that too much to ask for?! I love how the employees look like they don't want to be at work and that you're annoying them for even coming to order food and giving them business. I gave this location 2 stars because I actually like the food but next time I will take my happy butt to another location where it's much cleaner and have nicer staffs.

This specific Hi-Health location is awesome! The staffs are friendly and very helpful. If you have questions about any product they will answer your questions and will also give you some suggestions to help you decide on what you need. They also have great selections of health items. I always get my protein powder here. I love how sometimes they have samples for you to try first before you buy it. I will continue to shop here for my protein. :)

I finally decided to write a review even though I have been coming to Grabba Green for a while now. The food is decent if you're looking for a healthy alternate from all the fast food places around here. I would love to give them more stars but their service is horrendous and slow. Horrendous because every time I go, I felt unwelcome. I believe in good customer service especially when your client is paying a ridiculous price for stuff they can make at home themselves. A smile would also be nice instead of having a f**k face all the time. Especially the red headed step-child dude. Maybe you should find another job because apparently customer service isn't your forte. Maybe it's just towards me because they seem to smile and seem helpful towards other people. I'd rather make my own salad and juice then ever come back to this establishment.   Like I said if you like healthy stuff then do try this place out but don't expect a cheery staff to greet you that enjoys their job or act like they actually enjoy their job and don't expect fast service also.

I love that Ulta is a one stop beauty store. They have everything from high end to low end products for all your beauty needs. It's convenient and easy to get what you need and leave without any hassle. If Sephora run out of the makeup items that I want then I would come to this Ulta to check if they have it in stock and they usually do which makes me a very happy girl. :) I also purchase all my salon brand shampoos and conditioners here. They have a great selection of different bands. Will I continue to shop here? Of course I will!
