I love going to the library. I have a horrible addiction to books, but have realised that I cannot buy all the books I want. So the Mesa Public Library it is!   This place is on my way home from work, which makes it very convenient. But the best thing is the online services. You create your account with your card & PIN, then you can search, renew and reserve your books online. It's great for those people who have busy lives or are just super lazy, like me!!   You go online and search for the book you want. You can then reserve it and no matter what Mesa library has it, they will ship it to your local branch. If it's not immediately available, you go on a waiting list and they will email you when it's ready. Then you go in and it's waiting with your name at the front of the library. You never even have to deal with a person, which is awesome.  The only gripe I have is renewing books that have a waiting list. Sometimes you can renew them online, sometimes not. Sometimes in the branch you can, sometimes you can't.   They also have free wi-fi with your library account.

BFF and I went here yesterday afternoon. Very close to my work, and I'll go here for sure on my lunch break/right after work.  LOVED: Very long leg massage. Hot rock massage. HOT towels to wipe off the oil/lotion.  Didn't love: Water was tepid at best. Not enough pressure on the massage. My legs were very oily after, and I need to rub it in more to be able to pull my pant legs down.  Still, for $20, probably the best I've had since I've been in AZ. I'll see how long my pedi lasts. Will be back for sure!!  Oh, they have a sign up to please tip in cash. Thanks goodness my BFF had cash, since I never carry it.

Went here for the second time today. The food probably only rates a three, but the service definitely bumps it up a notch! They are so nice!!   Today got the orange chicken lunch special ($5.25). Orange chicken, fried rice, cream cheese puff and egg roll. The orange chicken was a bit spicy for my taste, but good. I don't think I'll get the fried rice again, not much a fan of that. Also got an order of pot stickers ($4.95) that were tasty! Love love love the cream cheese puffs!   Next time I'll ask for more sweet & sour. Not nearly enough for the stuff I got.

First of all, the only two bad things about this place are the parking and the wait. But with food this good, who cares???   I like to try something different most times and everything I've tried has been fantastic! Go with friends so you can try lots of things.   Start with the KickBUTT Garlic Bread with cheese. I could just eat this! For salads, my favorite is the Vino Bambino...salad, pasta, beans, chicken, cheese, onions, red peppers. Just YUM!   For the pasta, Pesto Penne Bake is at least two meals! It comes in a huge bread bowl that is so tasty itself. The Big Rig Pasta is also a huge hit.   The different pizzas are also fantastic, but if you are going to go with a pizza-ish thing, go with the Ozone Calzone. So melty and cheesy and just so freaking good!   Go with my favorite drink, the Bellini! A tasty frozen mix of champagne, peaches, raspberries and all sorts of other tasty stuff! They limit you to two, but it's worth it. Lucky I'm withing walking distance!   YOU MUST YOU MUST YOU MUST!!! Finish your meal with their Pizza Cookie. You can choose chocolate chip, peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut. We usually get half peanut butter/half chocolate chip. Ooey, gooey, hot, ice creamy goodness!!   The service is always fantastic as well! My friends and I had the displeasure of going last year once when their A/C was out. In July. Despite the fact that everyone was miserable, the staff still had great spirits and was right on the ball with everything. So much so that I felt the need to send in a positive letter about the staff despite us being miserable.  Go, eat, drink, LOVE IT!

I drive by this place twice a day on my way to and from work. For 2 1/2 years. And I'd never stopped in until yesterday, when the books on the sidewalk outside called my name on my way to Trader Joes.   This place is amazing! I had no idea it was so big. I love anywhere with books, but when you have cute gifts, trinkets and other fun stuff, it makes it even better!   I only picked up one book, but I wish I would have had the money (and the shelf space!), I would have gotten a dozen more. I will also have to take more time next time to read the staff recommendations, which there were a lot. Excellent touch!

Love, love, love this place!!!   Food is fantastic. I usually get the "Pick Two" and get a turkey sandwich with all the veggies (cucumbers, sprouts, onions, tomatoes, lettuce) on the 9-grain bread and a garden salad. The salad is fantastic! Spring mix lettuce, carrots, peppers, mushrooms. Not your ordinary side salad! And the honey mustard dressing is fantastic.   I have also eaten The East Coast Panini (pastrami, sauerkraut on rye), The Scottsdale (roast beef, red peppers on sourdough) and several other sandwiches. All top notch. Their red potato salad is also fantastic.   The service is stellar as well. The counter people are always really friendly and quick. Your food comes fast and I've never had a mistake in my order. One of my favorite AZ places!!

My sister and I go her every month or so. She says she likes sushi, but she's not very adventurous. So she gets the shrimp crunch roll, we split an order of shrimp & veggie tempura (onions, squash, carrots, avocado, zucchini) and I get either a California roll or a chicken Teriyaki bowl.   Food is really tasty and hot when it's supposed to be. The workers are nice and bring the food right to your table. Quick, everything tastes fresh. Not a ton of sushi variety and I wish there were more descriptions (I'd probably order other rolls if I knew what they were/what was in them), but over all I enjoy this place a lot.

My first trip to Sprinkles yesterday, but second time I'd had their cupcakes.   We decided to get two each, then half each one, so we could try four. Got the Peanut Butter Chip, Red Velvet, Lemon & Cinnamon Sugar.   We were about fourth in line when we got there, but by the time we left, it was packed. They do a good job of getting though the line and getting people out quickly.   Not a big fan of the Cinnamon Sugar. Don't get me wrong, it was REALLY good, but more of a muffin than a cupcake...no frosting! The lemon frosting was fantastic, the cake just ok. Not lemony enough for me! Red Velvet was tasty, the frosting really good. But both of us agree that the Peanut Butter Chip was the winner of the day! The nice peanut buttery cake with just enough chocolate flavor and the to die for peanut butter frosting! All cakes were very moist.   Loved it enough that we will be making another trip out there this week before she leaves. Delicious!   Parking lot SUCKS. Especially when the biggest ever black SUV feels the needs to sit idling for more than 20 minutes blocking the flow of traffic. Park in a spot already!!!

Went here for dinner Saturday night, the first night my BFF was in town! Our plan was to drive here, drink a LOT, then walk back to my place which is close. Didn't exactly work out that way, when our drinks were $8 a piece.  Started our with Gyoza and I had the Peach something drink (FABULOUS!) and my friend had the Snow Over Tokyo (a little too strong for our taste).  The Gyoza was very good, nice and crispy an good flavor.  We went a little overboard on the sushi rolls. Spicy Tuna, Las Vegas, Double Shrimp, Rainbow, and I can't remember the last one. All were very good, but I've decided the LV is not for me...I don't like my sushi warm. Loved the Spicy Tuna and the fish on the Rainbow were all very fresh and delicious. Took quite a bit home, the rolls were very good sized.  Service was EXCELLENT! My water stayed filled the whole time, which is great with the spicy stuff. Very attentive.  Would return for sure, but it will have to make it during happy hour. Prices were a little high for what I usually would do.  Oh, and their front door is really cool! It's kinda on a swivel, so it opens in the middle. Neat! Very cool, hip feeling in this place.

Went for happy hour this time, and upped my stars to five! Happy hour is, for sure, the time to visit!  Another best friend in town, and we hit the place about 5:30 on Friday night (happy hours are 4-6). She got a Saketini which is the signature drink. I had a sip and it was very tasty!  We also got two apps: Gyoza and Edamame. Both perfect.   For our sushi, we went with: Spicy Tuna, Avocado, a Salmon, and a Crunch Roll. All were very good. Plenty of food for the two of us to come out full!  Service once again was stellar. Water stayed full and our waitress answered my questions well about just what makes the Spicy Tuna spicy!  Total bill was just over $28 with tip. Love it!

Had a friend in town from the East Coast. Had planned on something else, but our plans changed and we were near Tempe Market Place so we went for a walk around and ended up here. She'd never had Mongolian BBQ before!   Seating is a bit cramped, but ok. Our waiter (Travis) was fantastic. To our table really soon after getting seated. Asked if we'd ever been there (no) and took our drink order. Happy Hour (which is all day!) well drinks $2, score!   He then took us over the main area and told us what to do. I ended up with scallops and shrimp, seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic. Water chestnuts, onions, green onions, cilantro, mushrooms. Sauce was the honey soy. All over white rice.   Food came quickly and perfect cooked! The shrimp was tender and not dried out. The scallops were tasty too. The best part of Mongolian BBQ is that it is so hot when it comes out to you! Excellent flavor all around. My friend had the beef with the citrus sauce and enjoyed hers as well.   Best thing is they don't make you decide if you want the all you can eat or one bowl till the end. I thought for sure I'd want all I could eat, but I was full after one bowl.   I'll be back for sure.

I was so excited when I found out they were putting in a HL in the East Valley. Then I went there. And all my hopes of lovely scrap stuff were dashed. I seriously hate going to this store. The only thing that will drag me out there is the prices. Those can't be beat when there is a sale. That's the only reason they are getting even two stars.  The lines are outrageous. No scanners in a chain store in 2009? Yep, that's correct. Everything has to be entered by hand. The cashiers will routinely ask YOU if an item is on sale, as they have to enter that manually as well. It can work out for you, as often time things that aren't on sale get rung up as such. But if you don't watch, you can also not get sales on items you should. Watch carefully!  I've really only shopped in the scrap section, so this is only about that. Half the shelves are empty all the time!! I went one Saturday for paper and the shelves were more than half empty, but you couldn't navigate the aisles because they were full of boxes of paper!! Well, the next day their ad came out with all paper 50% off. SWEET! I figure that's why it was a mess. So I go back in the next Friday and IT IS STILL A MESS! The boxes are still all over the aisles, now with not so nice notes to not go in the boxes and the shelves are even emptier! I asked the one worker I could find if they would be out before the sale was over. Doubtful she said, as more stuff kept coming in and they couldn't keep up. Couldn't tell by the shelves that they were getting in new stuff!  I've went back a couple of times since. The only time there aren't huge lines and at least 20 minutes of waiting is right before they close. So don't go and think you can run in and out!

I never get to go out to breakfast, but we went to Crackers & Co for a co-workers going away lunch early enough to order breakfast. SCORE!   We were a party of about 12, came in at about 11 on a weekday. I have to give high praise to our waitress. She was very attentive, didn't get anyones order wrong. Split all of our bills without being asked. Gave them all to the right people and brought our change quickly!   My food was FANTASTIC. I had the "Traditional Breakfast" with sourdough toast, scrambled eggs with cheese and country fried steak. Everything was hot, cooked perfectly and very tasty. Loved the crispy potatoes. The gravy on the country fried steak was good flavor, and the steak it self didn't feel like a grease bucket from being fried. I ate every bite it was so good. I felt like I was going to explode, but I didn't care.   I only wish I could get out to breakfast more often. Sigh.

Knocking my review down a star because of my group's experience yesterday.   Had another work lunch there. There was about 14 of us total, and the service was pretty sub-par. She had no idea what food went where, drinks were the same. Very few refills. My cup stayed empty of water for more than 10 minutes, I asked for a refill, and it still took another 10 minutes to get one. And then they were out of iced tea...even when they were going to be open for at least another hour and a half. How does that happen???   One girl didn't get her ranch with her meal. She brought it back really quickly, but had already forgotten who asked. She took it to the opposite end of the table.   I had the Wednesday special. Chicken Parmesan sandwich on a grilled Italian roll with fries. Sandwich was ok. I actually perfer the same sandwich at Mimi's. The fries were really good! Glad I got those over the salad. My friend was picking out the slimy lettuce from her salad.   Thankfully this time we went with one check, as opposed to the split ones from last time. I would have hated to see how she handled that.

Stopped here yesterday afternoon for a pick me up. Had a hard time deciding between the Lemon Creme scone and the Carrot Spice muffin. Went with the muffin and am so glad I did! It was so good. Lots of flavor, lots of chunks of real carrots and other good stuff inside. Not dry at all. Only disappointment was the cream cheese that was on top all ended up in the bag instead of on my muffin. Sadness :(   I also got an iced latte that was very good. I only wish I had gotten a bigger one than small, because it went way too fast.   I'll return here for sure. I really want to try that Lemon Creme scone!

I've been there twice now and it's very good. The counter people were very nice both times. Very quick in and out and love the prices!  The first time I had birthday cake (I think that was the name, maybe just cake) flavor with cinnamon syrup and graham crackers. The second time I had mint fro-yo with chocolate syrup and oreos. YUM.   I was disappointed the second time to see the cinnamon syrup gone, that was tasty. I would also like to see some type of peanut butter topping. Other wise, very happy with this place!

I'm dinging it one star because it IS the home of the Dodgers and that in itself makes it not perfect.   I visited this park yesterday, Sunday, March 29th. A Dodgers vs. Padres game. BEAUTIFUL stadium. I did think it was odd that the main entrance was in center field and not home plate, where I entered. Love the natural, rusted look of everything. Seems very large for a spring stadium.   Excited out the center field entrance before game time and explored the practice fields and water features. Awesome area. I think I need a whole day just to see everything out there.   We sat on the grass, in left field on the foul side of the foul pole. Great area, beautiful view. Unlike a lot of the other grass area seating at other parks, we could actually see the scoreboard and all the fielders. A thumbs up in my book!   All the workers were really nice. I got a hi from most of them just walking by!   Can't comment on any of the food/drinks as I didn't spend any money there. I brought in all my own stuff.   I was disappointed in the team store. I was looking for something commemorating the first year of the park, like I was able to pick up in Goodyear. Nothing. Would have been nice to have. Really, that's the main reason I wanted to get out there this year, to get an inaugural year souvenir.   Great place. If it weren't so far away, I'm sure I'd go more often.

I'd really been craving fish & chips and was excited to see one right next to the store I was scrapbooking at all day on Saturday.   First off I was annoyed that there was no where inside to sit. But they have pretty good misters, so ok. I stand there looking at the menu, but have to wait for the worker guy to finish flirting with the girl at the counter before I can give my order.   I ordered the combo that contains 1 fish, 4 shrimp, fries and a drink. I'm sitting at the table reading my book with my earphones in waiting for my food, because they said they would bring it to my table. So it's been a while and I turn around to look back at the place and they are standing in the window with my food. Boo.   The only condiments that came with my food were some sauces that was very thin, kinda like a hot sauce? But not real hot. No condiments anywhere else and no one at the window anymore. So I sit down to eat. These are shrimp? Really? I couldn't tell with all the breading. They taste like nothing. Literally, they have no flavor at all. The fish was ok, but way overcooked. It was pretty dark. The fries were good, the only thing in the meal worth anything. Oh, and the Dr. Pepper was good, but it's hard to mess up the Nectar of the Gods!   I ended throwing away half my food which I NEVER do (and if you've seen me, you know). Will not be going back, ever. Except maybe for Dr. Pepper.

I seriously do not get the appeal of this place!   I tried it quite a while ago back in California and didn't like it much. But everyone I know raves about it and it has been a while so I thought I'd try it again. Especially since it's so close to my house.   Blah. I got a cheeseburger with grilled onions, tomato, their sauce and pickles. I passed up lettuce because they use nasty iceberg lettuce. Can I get an upgrade? How about green leaf lettuce like is shown on their website? Also got fries and a Dr. Pepper. The Dr. Pepper was the greatest thing about the meal. OK, the service was good too. Very friendly, kinda creepily so.   The fries are just weird. I'm sure people say it's because they are fresh. OK, then I'll take un-fresh fries any day. These ones are just gross.   The burger is just nothing special. The flavor is not great. My burger wasn't even that warm by the time I got home, which is only a mile away. And it was 154 degrees inside my car. How does it get that cool in that quick of a time?   Again, another place I'll probably only return to for the Dr. Pepper. Clean place, good service, good energy, not so great food.

I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place, since it's on the way home from work.   I finally got the chance to stop by yesterday. They've been open about a week now. They are located on the north west corner of Guadalupe & McClintock, between the pet food store and Panda Express.   Super cute place, has a roll up/fold up door so the whole front of the building can be open, right onto their little patio. You can sit inside or outside!   Tons of different flavors! I tried the Peanut Butter & Jelly & a mint/chocolate one. Both were very tasty. I ended up going with their chocolate yogurt with some peanut butter sauce, a Giradelli chocolate sauce and peanut butter cups. SO GOOD. A decent sized cup cost about $3.30.   The girl who rang me up was super nice, and offered me up little sample cups.   The only suggestion I have is to label the toppings. Yes, most all of them are self-explantory, but a lot of those candy bars look the same all chopped up!   I will be back for sure!

Food choices don't seem to be that varied, though the food trucks do seem to be good options. The pork tenderloin sandwich looks good, but line was SUPER long.   Over all, glad I came because it completes my tour of AZ parks, but I'd really only recommend for Cubs fans or people who aren't in for a more laid back experience.

I don't need the ticket taker wasting my time, telling me how girly my movie is and how he would never see it because of that fact. I really don't feel the desire to have commentary on my movie viewing habits, thank you very much!  Oh, and the parking sucks. There is always five people trying to get into one spot. I hate it.
