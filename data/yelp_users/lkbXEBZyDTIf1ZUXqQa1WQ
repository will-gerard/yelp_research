Their service is extremely slow and Vegas roll was horrible .. No tuna inside the roll ,and not good as they usually do in other RA locations. Manager didn't even come to our table to ask how was our service . I'm not coming back here!!

I had to cancel my service the next day, but there was some misunderstanding over the phone with the front desk . I received an invoice for it a month later while My thought was this was cancelled. My sales rep went to work for me and fought to get my billing issue resolved. This shows her professionalism and salesmanship. Amy was great, I will definitely go back to her.
