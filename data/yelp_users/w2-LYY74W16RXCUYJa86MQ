OK -- not much else to add to what has already been said, creepy looking place but knock your socks off good Mexican food.  I've driven by this place on my way to work for nearly 4 years and always thought it was a bit too dumpy even for me.   LEST WE FORGET - the crappier looking, dingy, run down, hot, windowless, next to a bus station types of Mexican food places are the BEST. This one has all the above. Its cheap too.  I had the chimichanga with beef machaca. So freaking good. Probably the best chimi I've ever had next to Rito's, of course. But this place has better hours :)

Was in the mood for some Gyros and Yelp reminded me of this place just down the street. This place didn't disappoint! HUGE portions, delish food, (especially the pita), and super friendly people. Will definitely be going back :)

I give The Donkey a 5 Star, my first 5. The Donkey holds a special place in my heart, many many good eats and plenty of great beers had here. If you like beer - you MUST Try the Bad Donkey "P"!!! Where the P stands for Premium!! Seriously, its a Belgian white -- and having been to Belgium, this is a damn fine beer. If you are squeamish, ask for a sample -- they'll gladly give you a small glass to test the waters. I've yet to see anyone say no after a sip.  The service is great and the food is always super fresh and good lord is it tasty. I stick to my "Crusty Old Italian" with pepper jack most of the time but there are so many good subs, salads and pizzas here its hard to pick a bad eat. Super healthy to super meaty/cheezy - the Donk has you covered.  The owner Charles and his wife Julie are often found behind the counter at the Donkey -- not only some of the nicest folks I've ever met, but they are freaking HILARIOUS. I've probably spit at least a dozen mouthfuls of beer whilst eating at the Donkey when these two are around due to shear intense laughter. I love a place that not only combines great food, spectacular cold beer but good times.   Also -- if you went in the early days and couldn't get a seat -- they have expanded the seating area and added a belly-up bar (wine and beer only) and even a ice cream shop! Ask Charlies for a 'Boothie' (Donkey P and orange sherbet! Sounds weird but holy hell its amazing! And has alcohol! YES!!!)  You won't be let down by The Donkey!!

Well, I was looking for something new and so I googled "Best lunch in Mesa" -- came across Dooby's. Checked it on Yelp and looked at their website. It was 2:25 on Sunday and being only 3 miles from my house I figgured I could get there well before closing.  We got there at 2:40 and were promptly greeted by "Kitchen is closed!". As I turned to walk out the waitress said they may have a few items left and scurried to the back to check.... Indeed, they had some chicken shawarma so we got that to go.  Price was $13 which is a bit steep for a couple pitas, but I have to say it was damn tasty. I will have to check this out again... Just get there WELL before closing.

Okay - we made it back to Dooby's for dinner on a Friday night after work. My memory of the food from Dooby's had me excited for a second try. Well, we walk in around 8 and the place is pretty full, but plenty of seating remained. The waitress told us to sit 'wherever' - we chose a spot near the window so not to be on display in the rather open seating area...  I squinted at the beer taps and didn't see any of my old standbys, so when our waitress made her way over to the table I asked what was on tap. She rattled off a few, and I picked one. My girlfriend ordered a soda. My beer took FOREVER. Forever! This is a major pet peeve of mine - when I sit down, I want to start drinking, soon. I realize waiters/waitresses are often slammed - I've been in their shoes, so I try to cut them some slack. But this time, my waitress was only 15 feet from me and was flirting up a storm with a couple oafs at the bar. Serious, I was making evil-eye contact with her trying my best to emit my ESP rendering of  "BRING MY EPHIN BEER". Eye contact was continuously made with little regard for my parched state. Seriously, get me drinking and I am much more likely to forgive your crappy service!  So, my beer arrives - and I swear to god the pint glass looked as if one of the oafs had taken a few fat gulps before it meandered its way to my table. Come on - several dollars for a pint, I want a pint dammit! The glass is 5/8ths full will not cut it! I'm not the type to complain at restaurants - again, I've been there, so I try to cut them slack, so I just took a deep breath and let it go. (While drafting my 'yelp the crap outta you!' rant in my head)  I ordered the Gyro dinner and my sweetie had the falafel platter. I love gyros. We were given the option of soup or salad - I asked what the soup was. It was lentil, so I eagerly said soup! My answer was greeted with a vacuous stare from our waitress. I repeated soup.... To which I got a Bill and Ted's style "OOOoooooh". WTF.  A few minutes later, she comes back and says "salad will be okay, right?". I love being told what will be okay - serenity now!   The salad arrives, and it's a medley of minced lettuce, tomatoes, and other stuff. I hate tomatoes. If I can pick them out, its ok, but there were hundreds of little cubes in there. Gross - sorry. I wanted lentil soup after all...  Later when the waitress picked up my untouched salad I noted her lack of observation or care that I didn't touch it. At least pretend?   So, our food finally comes, and I dig in. Meh. The gyros are pretty plain frankly, not bad but plain. There were some pita wedges and like seriously a teaspoon of humus. A TEASPOON!?!?! I like a teaspoon per bite!   I'm done with Dooby's at this point - and then out of nowhere comes  "LA LA LA LA LA" Clank! Clank! Clank! A belly dancer comes running out clanging those shrill finger cymbals and the music begins to blast. Ugh. There goes the pleasant conversation! It was at least a warm atmosphere before - but now its loud and there is a large woman shaking and shrieking about the place. Soon the belly dancer makes her way to our table and starts wobbling her gut within inches of our plates. We try not to pay attention to her, just trying to eat here. She moves on, but within minutes, she's back and tells us "come on guys! Get up and dance!" Seriously, I'm eating; I'm not thrilled about being accosted by a freaking belly dancer in Mesa Arizona. This isn't Peter Piper Pizza Dooby, and it didn't seem the other patrons were really digging it either.   My bill was $35 bucks - I'm not a cheap ass but seriously that's insane for what I got - remember, a teaspoon of humus. $10 and it might have been a good value.  So, bottom line - I had terrible service, a sub-pint of beer, marginal gyros and a jello-belly gypsy all up in my face at Dooby's. Not impressed, and not going to be returning.

Tried this a few weeks ago and ever since had a hankering to get back for more. Only problem is their stupid hours... Who closes at 7PM on the weekdays, 2PM on saturday, and isn't open on Sunday? Guess when you're sitting on a gold mine you can do what you want...  Burgers are big and sloppy and awesome. That's really all there is to say. Decor is kinda cool, I posted pics if you want to see some.   Food is cheap and fast, a big plus. Its right off the Thomas and Central Lite Rail stop, so if you're looking for good eats, Lenny's is a good stop! Only problem is the hours, but hell if I was old Lenny, I'd need some time for golf too.

My girlfriend and I went on a mission for chicken and waffles at Lo-Lo's -- but a 40 minute wait outside in 110 degree weather just didn't suit me. So, we headed down the road and found ourselves at Ires --  First - make sure you bring cash - no plastic allowed here. I had to brave crossing Broadway in South Phoenix to use an ATM across the street.   We ordered Jerk Chicken, Curry Chicken, a beef meat pie, chicken meat pie, a ginger beer and a mango juice. The total was $30 - which I thought was a bit much until I saw the size of the portions. This is easily 2 meals worth for me, maybe 3 for my girlfriend.  This is no-frills, authentic Jamaican food. The plate was piled high with super spicy (the way it should be) Jerk Chicken. This is not for the faint of heart - the chicken had just been hacked up, no attention given to looking nice or avoiding bone fragments. But, this is the way it should be - after all, this is authentic Jamaican food in the heart of South Phoenix. If you want fancy food, make a reservation at some theme restaurant in Scottsdale.   But, lets be clear -- this was damn good food. Hearty, fresh and spicy. The meat pies are the best I've ever had. If you go, have a ginger beer - its sooo tasty! The mango juice was delicious as well, seemed fresh and may have had a little seasoning/spices added to it. Was the best I've ever had, and simply doesn't compare to what you'll get from Dole or Tropicana.   There were a number of Jamaicans hanging out in the place, in and out of the kitchen. Everyone was incredibly friendly and waited on us with pleasure. There are 3 pinball machines along the back wall and at least a dozen Bob Marley posters scattered along the walls.  Some of the other reviewers said it was dirty -- I wouldn't say that at all -- the place just had character. It fits in well with its S. Phoenix neighborhood. If you want white table cloths, again - Scottsdale, not South Phoenix.    Overall - I dig this place. Friendly people, really good food, charm, and HUGE portions. It may seem a bit pricey at first, but trust me you get every pennies worth.

I'm surprised to see all the great reviews for this place - I think its terrible in many ways...  I work across the street and my coworkers and I often head over to the AZ center for Happy Hour. We've tried 1130 a few times and each time leave disappointed. This place tries to be more than it is and charges a pretty penny for its mediocre food and horrible service. I've been in there when there are only 2 other tables filled in the entire place and not seen my waiter for 20 minutes. My glass empty and my group ready for another round.  On our last trip, we got there 10 minutes before they started happy hour - they wouldn't serve us at happy hour prices, so we said come back in 10 minutes then. Most places I've been will gladly serve you and just wait to punch in the order in a few minutes, but 1130 was not interested in do this. So, after 10 minutes, no waiter. 25 minutes, no waiter. Some goofy dude came out after a while and told us our waiter was getting dressed and would be right out.... Another 10 minutes later, she made her way out and we finally got our order in!!  When she brought our beers ( 2 8th Streets, 2 Blue Moons) she handed us the glasses - who does that? Every place I've ever been sits them on the table rather than awkwardly hand them to you risking spilling it all over you... Whats worse is the pint glasses weren't even full!! They looked as though our late dressing waitress had taken a fat gulp out of them on her way to our table!!  We also ordered some Calamari, luckily it was happy hour so it was 1/2 way affordable, but it was heavy on the garnish and few on the calamaris. There were 4 of us and you know how it is when you share an ap, nobody wants to be the one to finish it - well, our waitress finally made her way back to our table (after I had an empty glass for over 10 minutes) and without asking took the plate of calamari! For RUDE! Paws off lady, ask first before grabbing at our food.   Overall, this place is trying to be way more than it actually is. Its way overpriced for what you get. The service is horrendous - and I say that only after giving it several tries. It might be an okay place to grab a drink (it is cozy afterall) but even at $3.25 happy hour pints, it ain't cheap. I just don't see it lasting long at that location.

For 3 years I have lived less than a mile from Top Shelf, and for more than half that time I would drive by and scoff ... What kind of name is Top Shelf ? Sounds like a strip club, not  a Mexican joint.  Well, I wish I wouldn't have been so prejudice. This place is awesome. My mouth waters every time I think about it.  I only eat 2 things here, the chips and salsa and the Carne fundido. Its all I need. Oh, add a pitcher of margaritas and I am in hog heaven.  First the chips & salsa -- this is one of the rare places that brings you 2 bowls of salsa. One mild and chunky. One puree of the HOT stuff. Mix n match and you have a nice treat before the big meal. They also have bottled hot sauce on the table. The possibilities are endless!   Next, the fundido -- I LOVE fundido. Top Shelf has THE BEST I have ever had. Its rich, creamy, tangy, smoky and delish. For the gringos out there, this is a chimichanga smothered in a spicy cream cheese sauce. This is not health food, but being happy is healthy, so its all equal in the end. Live a little and try it. They have pollo fundido too...  Top it off with some margaritas. Real, salty, tangy margaritas. And guess what?!?! They actually put tequila in them!! Thats more than I can say about the majority of the cheap Mexican places around the valley.   Anyway - go to Top Shelf. It's awesome. Who cares about what they have on the wall (the have a sweet tropical mural!). You go to a restaurant to eat, not judge their interior decorating style. Have  a margarita and forget that materialistic stuff~~

Meh is right. This place was a big yawn for me...  I went with a group of 5 (well, 4 adults, one kiddo). This is another one of those places that tries to be fancy and pretty much sucks -- for the price and portion size anyway. We ordered beef stew, chorizo stuffed dates, halibut, cheeze sticks, chicken and white cheddar waffles, and some beers.   First on the beers... They have Four Peaks 8th Street on tap (privately labeled as Tucks Ale or something like that) and I was happy to see this -- I love this beer. However, halfway into my meal my glass was dry and it sat that way for a good 10 minutes. If you've read any of my other yelps, you know I expect a refill promptly, especially if you expect me for forget your marginal service and mediocre food...   When the waitress came around, she asked if I wanted another beer, I said yes. Another 10 minutes went by, me parched, growing annoyed... When she came around again it was clear she forgot all about me, then asked one of my friends if they wanted another beer -- I assertively said YES. She looked at me and proclaimed her sorrow, said it would be right up. Another 10 minutes go by, she swings by and apologizes that they had to change the keg. I understand that -- but between the FIRST and second time I asked, I watched the bartender pour another 4 or 5 8th Streets. But I didn't get one.  As for the food? Super duper BLAND. Come on Tuck's! Fancy (read expensive) food should be an explosion of complex flavor in my mouth. If I have to put table salt and pepper on it just to taste something, you pretty much suck. If we pay $30+ per person and I leave hungry, you pretty much suck. The fried chicken was pretty good, but I've had the same quality stuff from the deli at Safeway.  Overall, not impressed and see no reason to return. If you're taking a girl out on a first date who is more into atmosphere than food -- she'll probably think you are the man. But really, do you want a girl like that?

Called these guys to remove an old deadbolt from a security door I didn't have the key for. They came out promptly on a saturday night and removed the old lock in minutes. I had worked on that thing for over an hour with no success! Very friendly and even went the extra mile of installing my new lock and giving me advice on securing my garage door. Will definitely call Lockaid again when I need a locksmith!
