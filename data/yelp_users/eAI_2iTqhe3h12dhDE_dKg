Very Rude!  No customer service...I went in to place a large order of 100 scarves with printing...The receptionist seemed as if I was bothering her and didn't want to find out if they could help me....Will Never Go Back!  I can't even give 1 star but I have to on yelp

The BEST Spa in the Valley!  I just had 2 hours of Bliss for my Ultimate Relaxation Massage!  The Therapist Julie has "Magic Hands" with the perfect pressure....If you haven't been you're missing the best part of Life!

Again Hawaiian Experience Spa never disappoints!  Simply the BEST!  My facial, scrub and 2 hour Ultimate Relation massage was great!  I can't wait to go back in a month...who am I kidding...I'm going back in 2 weeks!

"Zach has the best consult before the massage! He reviews my chart while we are discussing my needs and ask questions! Alyscia knows Skin Care!"

The entire team at Creating Magic Salon are Outstanding!  I had a Ladies Night Mani/Pedi and it was EXCELLENT!  We will definitely be back!!!  Plus they have really cute jewelry!
