Food poisoning, over priced, and mediocre service. I was there last night. The fish tacos  were small, $4 each, & have made me terribly sick today & unable to work. I asked the server a question she couldn't answer and she never sought help from her staff. But I did. And I got an answer. Also had to hunt down my own napkins, then salt and pepper, clean up my sons spilled drink by myself, and ask for a refill when the empty glass was right in front of her. Just sayin...

I've been around the world and have grown to appreciate real barbers like they have throughout Turkey.   Here Armen is a master. Don't be fooled by the simple decor and older neighborhood. This place is a buried treasure if you want a real cut by someone who enjoys their work.   He came from Uzbekistan then to NYC then to Scottsdale now he owns this place in Glendale. It's worth a trip. Get the works: hair beard mustache.
