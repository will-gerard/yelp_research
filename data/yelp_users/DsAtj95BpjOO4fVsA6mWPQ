The atmosphere at Pane Bianco was the first thing I noticed when walking in... I definitely felt like I stepped out of Phoenix and into a quirky European bistro.  Menu is limited for lunch but the options were solid and made my decision difficult!  I ended up going with the market sandwich which on that day, featured a sunny side up farm egg, burrata and asparagus and it was DELICIOUS.  A much larger portion than I expected, when combined with the high quality of the ingredients, justifies the slightly higher price.  My DP decided on a slice of their famous pizza, which are reheated slices during lunch.  I was kind of disappointed by this, but the bite I stole from him was still crunchy, cheesy, and tasty, so it didn't seem to make a difference.    I know it's only March, but my east coast skin was roasting in the sun at the tables out front.  An umbrella would have been delightful, but that's literally my only complaint.  Great food, service - I'd definitely return!

My beau loves Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, so while visiting my sister in Phoenix, we had to stop at Over Easy to check it out!    Understandably so, it was very busy around 10 am on a Sunday, but our wait was only about 20 minutes.  In Arizona in March, we had no problem waiting outside in the sun :)  We got a round of Over Easy Iced Coffees to start, which are delicious!  Cinnamon, cardamom, sweetened condensed milk and mint - unique and tasty!  I'll have to figure out how to make these myself.  The Wolfpack (great name, by the way) is really the way to go.  Simple ingredients - hashbrowns "stuffed" with eggs any style, your cheese of choice and bacon... but simple does the trick for this savory breakfast lover!    There are lots of great brunch/breakfast options in the area so I'll probably explore some new spots during my next visit, but this is a great standby.

If I lived in the area, this would be a go-to lunch spot for me.  Very affordable - my buffalo chicken wrap was $7.80 and my cucumber-infused water was complementary - nice outdoor seating and great service!  Definitely recommend!

Go.  We won a little bit of money gambling on Saturday night, so we decided to splurge a little on brunch.  Maybe it was better because it was "free", but everything was amazing.  Don't be intimidated by the line - it really does move quickly.  The decor is absolutely beautiful and I was really tempted to sneak out with some of the artwork!  Service was also fantastic, especially for a buffet.  My coffee cup was always full and there are always fresh bottles of water on the table - essential for a hangover brunch.  I don't even know where to start with the food.  I resisted the temptation to start at the dessert buffet and I may still be slightly regretting that decision because I have no self control and barely had room for dessert.  The variety and creativity in the food really blew me away - lots of asian fusion options, mac & cheese with just a little spice, sushi, kale salad, lots of benedicts and endless bacon and sausage... I could go on but you should really just go experience it for yourself.    Can't wait to come visit you again, Wicked Spoon!

Our party of 4 came in for a very early dinner reservation on a Friday night at 5:30.  There were only a few other tables with patrons, so the place was not busy by any means.  With all of that said - our service was absolutely atrocious.    We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and it took almost 10 minutes for our server to bring it to the table.  After placing our orders, the food came out haphazardly and three of us sat awkwardly with our sandwiches while we waited for our fourth DP's meal to arrive.  Lastly - we waited entirely too long for our check to arrive and our plates to be cleared, even though we were obviously finished.  I'm a sucker for good service and expected much more from a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan!  Service aside, the food was good.  I had the french dip and the truffled tator tots were the highlight of my meal.  I also really enjoyed the mushroom risotto that we all split as an appetizer.    Last note - I know it's Vegas, and anything goes, but there was a table of very obviously intoxicated women wearing swimsuit tops and stumbling all over the restaurant.  Come onnnnn.  I know restaurants have off nights, but I was really turned off by the service, especially considering that it was not busy.  I won't be back.

My sister and her friends love this bar, so when visiting her last week we spent our Friday night here.  I was DD so was flying solo in the sober department, but the people watching and endless variety of games kept me entertained for the whole night!    I am probably not the first person to say this, but winning a free drink playing skee ball is IMPOSSIBLE... but it's fun to try.  The shuffleboard is also so fun and is a rare find at bars.  Probably my favorite thing about this place!  From a past visit, I would recommend the moscow mule and they'll also make you a dark & stormy if you prefer rum.  Mixed crowd, relaxed vibe and plenty to entertain even the soberest person in your group - we'll be back the next time we're in town!  Oh - and you can park in the lot across the street for free.  Super convenient!

I was in Pittsburgh last weekend for a wedding, and had the pleasure of having my hair primped by Laura! Since my hair does not hold curl well, I asked Laura to curl my hair tightly so it would stay curly enough for the 5 pm ceremony.   Laura gave me a head full of beautiful curls, and pinned them to one side. Miraculously, my hair stayed curled until the end of the reception (midnight!) without needing any additional styling throughout the evening! Laura was a pleasure to talk to throughout my appointment, and the price was very reasonable at $40 + tip.  I highly recommend Tula and Laura!

I LOVE THIS PLACE.   I used to live in Scottsdale, and was recently back for a visit and am insanely jealous that this place exists in Old Town now!  I had the American salad just as it comes, and I devoured every bite.  The raspberry tea that I had to drink was also very good!  My non-salad loving DP had the BBQ chicken salad (when in Rome...) and his bowl was also clean when we left.  I'm now wishing that I had tried some of the juices or stopped back again before heading back east.  ChopShop, please come to Philadelphia!
