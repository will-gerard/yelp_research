Went here just before a movie. The service was fast but that's it. I ordered the mango and shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered nachos. The food was not good. I and my friend could not finish our food and we had stomach aches immediately after.

Loved it! The Greek omelet was great! I also had a bite of their French toast and I was very pleased. You have to try this place.

My favorite coffee shop on Phoenix! I love all the locally made treats and the coffee is amazing. I get the white chocolate mocha. In a addition it's a great place to study.

Love this place! Very interesting latte choices I love. The cayenne lateral is great and I also love AZ sunset and the lavender isn't bad either.  They have almond milk too! And half your purchase goes to charity.

Went Sunday afternoon. They took a while to seat us... 30min after our reservation but the food made up for it. Awesome food no complaint.
