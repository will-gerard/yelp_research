Wow, this place was fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced -- a great trifecta! Add in fast, and you've got a winner. Right after my arrival into PHX, Gabi K. brought me here, one of her favorite places for lunch.  I knew she had good taste!  I grabbed an avocado BLT, and I couldn't even believe how generous they were with the bacon -- there must have been 6-8 slices piled onto that sandwich, and it was just the right crispness. Bacon is to credit and blame for my fall from 12 years of vegetarianism, so this much bacon still feels truly indulgent!   They have a great assortment of salads, sushi, and beverages.  They also have loads of specialty foods, including jams and spreads, as well as some gift items. On the gift side of things, I admired some cool and colorful re-purposed magazines that were made into decorative vessels.   It really seemed like a wonderful one-stop place to have in the neighborhood. I like the idea of being able to pick up a quality sandwich, some groceries, and a present for someone, all at once!

When I was here last week, one of the other folks at the table asked me if there were lots of places like this in Ann Arbor, where I live.  Sadly, I had to answer no.  There's nothing quite like this in Ann Arbor, which is too bad. There are some great places here, and even a couple of nice places to sip wine, but the feel of Postino is totally different.  The warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open (nice garage doors), and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter, I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere.  I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?  The bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.  And of course, I enjoyed the wine.  In warm weather, I'm a white wine kind of gal, so I sipped a nice glass of Pinot Grigio. I was totally charmed by both the food and the company. Oh, and extra charm points for playing some Otis Redding. The service was just fine -- attentive without being intrusive. If they can't open a Michigan location, then I guess I'll just have to come back the next time I'm around Phoenix.

While I was staying at the Hotel Valley Ho, ZuzZu became my mini-office and my home base for some breakfast comfort-food.   The decor here, as in the rest of the hotel, is really late 50's/early 60's influenced. I love the look of everything from the chairs to the coffee mugs. The outdoor area has bright orange umbrellas and sweet little potted flowers adorning each table.   I only had breakfast options, but each hit the spot. My first day, I had their home made granola w/cranberries and apricots, with yogurt on the side. The granola was really top notch, and the dried fruit was plentiful, no searching for it among the grains. The second morning, I opted for the strawberry waffles, which were nice and fluffy. I don't make big demands of my waffles -- they just have to be hot and right texture -- and these were juuust right.  In addition tot he strawberries, they also came with an orange curd, which I ordered on the side -- a really nice touch!  I'm not sure if the orange or pineapple juice that I had was fresh-squeezed.  I somehow don't think that it was, but was tasty nonetheless.  My servers both days were extremely attentive and sweet.    I really loved the fact that the hotel's free wi-fi worked here.  It make it a great spot to work while eating, and also to sit in on/host meetings. The only downfall in this department was the lack of outlets.  However, they probably don't want you whiling away your whole afternoon there, even if you *are* a hotel guest, so perhaps that's for the best!

When we arrived, we were surprised at how relatively un-crowded the airport was.  Yeah!  But, the poor 2 people behind the US Air counter were obviously over-stretched.  Even one more person on the desk would have made things run a little smoother.   We were only slightly delayed. No big deal. It happens, particularly when it's snowing all across the land.  The weird thing, though, was the total confusion from the people at the gate desk about which place (Philly or DC) would board first. I should have known that this was a bad sign.   We got to DC only a 1/2 hr. late.  Not bad for holiday travel. However, nobody's luggage arrived.  Now, 7+ hours later, we still can't get any update on if our bags have been located.  Here's the thing -- I'd be more patient if we hadn't PAID to check the dang bags.  But if you pay to check 'em, and the airline manages to misplace a whole PLANE worth of luggage, I feel like I should get a refund on that $30 luggage fee.   US Air, you might get one more star if my luggage (containing my presents for everyone) arrives in time for Christmas.  But for now?  Sorry, I'm a little sore with ya. You get coal.

So, it's almost a week later, we're back home, and we're still missing a bag. I understand that sometimes baggage goes missing for a day or two. I wouldn't be quite as cranky about it if it seemed like one singular person we spoke with actually wanted to help us.    I'm not going to regale you with the gory details of my frustrating hours on the phone (mostly on hold or being transfered/dropped) with the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced.   Nope, instead I'm just going to sum it up with this: US Air=FAIL  I'm not usually a harsh person, but sometimes, you just have to tell it like it is.   I really hope that our other bag is found, eventually.  I also hope that US Air will revamp their baggage system so that people working within that system can all have access to the same information and update each other and customers.

I realized just the other day that I never updated this review.  Sadly, US Air still gets one star.   After months of waiting, filling out paperwork, and jumping through annoying hoops. we got reimbursed for less than 1/3 of what was lost. Not to mention that the biggest things lost were hand-made Christmas gifts.  We've learned our lesson about checking baggage... and about US Air.   After such a fiasco, I won't be flying US Air again if I ever have the choice.  If I have to fly on their airline, everything will be either shipped ahead or carry on.  Ack!

Wow.  If I had to live in a hotel for a few weeks, I think Valley Ho would be my pick. I would love it if there were multiple Valley Ho-style hotels, but I guess that might dilute this place's unique charm.   The awesome weather during my stay (sun! warmth!) didn't hurt, but I'm such a sucker for their design that I'd probably stay in a similarly designed hotel in Alaska.  Though, a tiki theme in Alaska would seem a little weird, I guess.   The decor is based on mid-century modern style, since the 50s and 60s were the resort's heyday. With this in mind, the design of everything from the lobby chairs to the lighting is well thought-out -- balancing mid-century style with contemporary convenience (super large soaking tub, flat-screen TV, wifi).   The decor is a little cartoony at times, but mostly the bright colors just come off as cheerful. A bit of a Technicolor touch is not necessarily a bad thing. There's a great tiki vibe, though sadly, I didn't get the chance to stop into Trader Vic's for a zombie (next time?).  The rooms are extremely spacious, and the beds are a dream -- instant Zzzzs. I love the patios adjoining some of the rooms. It was great to do some work on the laptop while laying back on chaise lounge. I did get a little bit of a vitamin D fix before I had to head back to gray ol' Michigan.  Like Andrea R., I stayed in building 5, but there were enough people around that it didn't really feel at all spooky to me.   The staff was extremely helpful and kind, and the little Cafe ZuZu was perfect for breakfast and a few meetings. I loved the option of sitting outside underneath a giant orange umbrella.   I hope that at some point I get to repeat my great experience at Hotel Valley Ho and add in a little trip to tiki-haven Trader Vic's.

Wow.  It's really intimidating to try to write a review of Noca.  Honestly, it was a culinary experience that I find hard, even now (after some scribbling of notes) to sum up effectively in words.  It was wonderful, unquestionably 5 stars.  I'd recommend it to even my most picky friends, were they in the Phoenix area.   But how do I explain just *how* enjoyable my food was here? I think that the best I can do is be extremely descriptive:  Now, a disclaimer: I came here with other dining companions, so not everything I sampled did I eat all by myself.  I am neither that gluttonous, nor that flush in the pocketbook!  But, I truly did enjoy every bite.   Started off with a nice, dry Anselmi Pinot Grigio, and a tempting little morsel that combined mushrooms with a light, flaky pastry. I sampled the spinach mezzaluna. It's silky ricotta melted on the tongue. For my main course, I selected Alaskan halibut. This was some of the best fish I've had.  The flavor of the fish came through, but I think the beurre rouge was really what accounted for that flavor -- while a cinnamon froth added just a slight kiss of sweetness.  The halibut was served with baby fennel and onions in a salsify tart.  The tart crust was wonderfully soft and flaky.  For dessert, we indulged: The first thing that came seems to be a fun sort of Noca signature -- a large cloud of ultra-fresh cotton candy. We each grasped a nibble or two, but couldn't resist some of the other items on the dessert menu.  The apple risotto is not risotto *with apples*. Instead, diced apples are cooked in a way that resembles the cooking of risotto.  A dollop of salt and butter ice cream (!) on top balances out the sweetness just right.  We also shared an order of doughnut holes -- cinnamon and sugar with a slightly crispy outside.  Three accompanying dipping sauces added a little extra to our sugar buzz -- my favorite was the dulce de leche.   All throughout dinner, the restaurant was extremely busy (particularly for a weeknight), but our server didn't skip a beat.  Owner Elliot was making the rounds, telling us more about the restaurant and making recommendations. It's obvious that his heart is in this restaurant completely, and it show (and tastes) accordingly!
