Had breakfast here the other day with the fam, great selection and to my delight, many items had a Greek twist to them.  On top of the food being tasty, you can easily share with a spouse, friend, relative or foe as the portions are huge!  I will definitely be back soon with friends.

Great, friendly service, food was very good, the flavor of the burgers are the best maybe due to the freshness and varieties of toppings, but burger I had was a LITTLE dry, nothing horrible, but just a little dry.  Onion Rings are out of this world!

This is by FAR the best Gelato in Arizona and possibly that I have ever had.  We drive from Mesa to Glendale for our favorite German restaurant but are lucky enough to live within a few blocks of Dolce Vita.    They have such unique flavors that keep you coming back to see what's new, like, Gorgonzola Walnut and Whiskey, but the staples are worth the drive from anywhere in the valley.

Amazing place and for an amazing price..I don't know what anyone is complaining about (except the roach person) this place for.  Look at the pictures, the portions are good, the sushi is fresh (AND HALF PRICE ALL DAY!), beer is a PENNY Friday and Saturday nights and AYCE not only sushi, but apps like BUTTER CALAMARI and entrees too!!    I will be bringing my family back, and my friends for sure, in fact, I think I will be going here for my birthday next month!  Thank you for places like this, who keep great food affordable in this economy, we need all the help we can get.

Pedritos ALWAYS has great and fresh food.  The owner is usually there cooking everything so you know it's good.  I especially like the quesadillas for the kids and you can't go wrong with ANYTHING on the menu.

Not bad but not great.  I just visited Geno's for the first time looking for an authentic Philly experience, and this (i'm sorry to say) is NOT it.  The atmosphere was not bad with plenty of seating and the game was on multiple TV's.  The service was ok, nothing to write home about.  The BIG disappointment was the portion size of the cheese-steaks.  For $8.99 you would think it would be loaded with meat and toppings (like the picture's show) like Philly's actually are for the same price, but you will be SADLY mistaken.  Do not waste your $$$ here if you can help it, I do not have the answer on a local authentic Philly yet, but this is not it...The search continues.
