The front desk staff needs better customer service skills, and that's all I have to say about that. Nice hotel, great friendly staff, plenty parking, free custom made breakfast, all rooms are suites with balconies, refrigerator, microwave, and free wifi. The staff was very accommodating, seeing as how we were here for bike weekend, and there was a lot of us, they sectioned off some of the parking lot for us, and put up signs, passed out plastic cups, and didn't complain too much about the noise. I would stay again when in town and they are centrally located by almost everything you might need when your visiting from out of town, especially eateries.

This rating is solely on customer service because we never were able to get services done. After requesting a specific appointment time, we were never called back for confirmation and when we showed up they were not apologetic nor did they try to accommodate us. Actually don't really think they wanted us there. This is the reason I like to go to REAL spas and not a strip mall pit stop. I agree with other yelpers their customer service is the worst I have experienced.

This is the largest Harley Davidson dealer thus far. They have nice and friendly staff and they seem to host a lot of events here. They are still building and plan to have a restaurant here by 2017. It has a movie theater in the basement, and the top floor offers a tattoo parlor and a nice size wedding chapel. If that's your thing they have a nice size terrace with seating outside the chapel for a great reception, super cool. Vending machines, motorcycle video games, and you can ring the big bell when you purchase a bike. My only complaint was for such a big dealer they did not have a great selection of women's clothing like others I have been to. Another cool thing about this dealership is the photo props throughout the store, you got to check it out if ever in Scottsdale.

Maybe I have outgrown the typical party in Vegas scene and gambling all my money away, because doing "corny tourist" things is the only way I roll now. Places like this is something you have to experience yourself so you can form your own opinion and also say you have did it at least once. We opted for the night tour because I felt we would appreciate the signs better. From the moment we entered, the staff was very nice and helpful. Our tour guide was fun, engaging, and very informative. Some of the lights were not lit as others have stated, but just to hear the stories and be up close and personal is good enough for me. The big skull heads from the old treasure island was awesome to see. Also felt kinda old because I used to stay at the Stardust back in the day, and now the sign is at the graveyard museum. This is not a big yard to tour, but it sounds like they plan to continue to grow, as long as interests are sparked. I would come back if it gets bigger, they have a 2 for 1 where you can visit mob museum also, next on my list.

Something else to do different in Vegas, it is a fun experience, lots of great photo props, and they always seem to have great discounts, no matter if you get online or groupon. Some of the figures are more realistic than others, as well as very young profiles of certain celebrities, like 15 years ago. I enjoyed myself and I recommend to all, you will really have fun taking pics with snoop, pac, Oprah, queen B, and Mr. President and family in the oval office. Don't forget to stop and shoot hoops with Shaq or block some shots like my hubby did.

I really had very high expectations for this place when I first found out we were attending a wedding reception dinner here. I have had great authentic food on the islands so I was excited about Bahama Breeze ( island grille ). Well I would like to say it is more like an American breeze with a Bahama inspiration. But after getting over the fact there is really no authentic food here this place is pretty good. We had a party of around 30 and were seated privately in a covered patio section of restaurant. This place is huge, nice and spacious. Seemed like everyone really enjoyed their drinks, I had the Bahamarita and it was very good. Ok so menu items we tried were beef empanadas: their version is good and the sauces that came with were very good. Coconut shrimp: I have had better but it was good, the sauce to dip was the winner. BBQ ribs: very good like rib joint good, Seafood and jerk pasta I was told was excellent, plenty of shrimp and lobster. The portions here are pretty big too, most guests had to go bags. I found out after the fact from a local that the one authentic item they had was conch fritters, man one of my favorites so can't wait to try them.  Our great, very patient, and very nice waitress Christine informed us about their happy hour, so we will be back since we visit Vegas frequently.

We were strolling the Las Vegas strip looking for something different to eat and walked thru New York New York casino and stumbled upon this place. Actually the aroma is what really caught our attention. The seating is pretty tight here not the most comfortable but I am a trooper. Their customer service was excellent and on point. I had the carne asada tacos and I can honestly say I have never had asada that tender before it was very good. The Spanish rice and beans were good and their guacamole is excellent. I would definitely visit again when I'm in town, just not sure if I would order a drink from here, they were pretty weak.

It's Vegas baby and Harley Davidson represented with their new and improved store that has relocated on the strip. This place is huge and they even got rentals. They have a lot of items to choose from and they do have sale racks. I love the Vegas decor and vibe of the place, and the outside is just as nice. Service in clothes department was ok, do not know if they have all the same staff, but remembered more friendlier people in the old store. Nonetheless, we love to shop at the different Harley dealers so we are guaranteed to be back.

Wow who would have thought I can get to stay in a great hotel and it's not on the strip. This hotel is pretty big, well maintained, and outstanding staff. The room setup was great, mini kitchen, nice bathroom, big TV with dvd, and comfy bed and pillows, even had a comfy recliner chair. The IHG brand continues to impress me and that's why I enjoy staying at their hotels. We had just came from a wedding it was 109 this past weekend and wanted to change our clothes before reception dinner. The staff was able to find us a room and we got to check in early, always a plus. We got to use our reward points, so our stay ended up costing only forty dollars, great stay, great customer service, and we will definitely be back.

First time we stayed here it was during construction when they first opened. Since we come to Vegas a lot I like to try new hotels each time. Wanted to give PH another try since a strip view room was pretty reasonable. Line for check in moves faster than others I have experienced so that was ok. Valet and baggage claim was great throughout our entire stay. A little disappointed blinds were broke when we arrived and had to call maintenance to fix. What's the point of strip view if i cannot see out of window. They did fix it within a couple hours so I was satisfied, housekeeping was great, staff is friendly, I think the rooms could use a little upgrading, the bathtub is HUGE and the view from 35th floor was cool. Able to see Bellagio fountains also. Just a note there is an old Paramount picture outside of South elevators and if you look and find Robin Williams on it you can clearly see he is the only unhappy person in the picture, that was very sad to see, because it was a long time ago.

I will give two stars since the customer service is the only thing that didn't suck. I have been wanting to try the one in LA so couldn't wait to check it out. I'm gonna assume after my horrible breakfast that maybe the waffles and pancakes are the stars of this establishment since that was all I saw coming out of the kitchen. And would also be the reason that I MIGHT try the one back home. So I ordered the huevos rancheros and it went downhill from there, the worst I have ever had. The tortillas were cardboard, the beans were chalk, and the flavor was.....was......was....sorry at a lost for words. I will say no more!

I have been waiting a long time to eat at Pappadeaux so forgive me if I get carried away. In town for some Harley riders fun so we knew this place was going to get crazy crowded, like Vegas Buffett crowded. So as soon as we arrived on Friday we decided to hit this seafood sanctuary early afternoon. YES best decision EVER. We heard the wait time for the whole weekend ended up being over an hour and a half, not for us, not for the trio that has been waiting on this moment since 2012. After we gave them our phone number so they can text us when our table was ready, we walked around to find a seat to wait and as soon as we sat down DING..... The doorbell to foodie heaven rang, literally a 2 minute wait. Okay so now we're headed to our table and I'm scoping the place out left to right up and down all around, this place is HUGE. Fun decorations, big window to see the chefs in action, lobsters in tank, dessert trays, bar popping, patio popping, plates piled with fish, waiters trying to keep a fast pace through the crowd, and lots of happy people. The drinks are fruity and strong, bread n butter on point. Their menu is extensive so it took us awhile to order. I ended up with the seafood platter, hubby had catfish fillets, my ride or die girl had the salmon. People talk about how pricey this place is BUT the portion  and the freshness of the seafood was stellar. We all had enough food left over for another meal. The lump crab cake is just that lump crab delicious. Stuffed crab was perfection. Fish was fried just right and the dirty rice was excellent. I can't wait to return next year same time same place, we will be there because I was checking out the king crab legs and they are now on my radar.

This is just another interesting place in Vegas to check out at least once, so your not just blowing your money in casinos. I did not have high expectations per some of the reviews, but I definitely came with an open mind. It's a pretty decent size museum, we had time to look at exhibits without being crowded by others. There is a lot of interesting facts, funny exhibits, strange exhibits, and a small movie theater with 1920's porn, REALLY?? They do more in music videos nowadays. What I found most interesting was the wall of women pedophiles and the Larry Flynt display. All you really need is about an hour or so here unless your really getting your knowledge on, about dildos and chastity belts. They have cute gifts to buy and the staff here is absolutely fantastic. Be different and go outside your comfort zone.

Thank you my fellow yelpers for the right on reviews. The customer service was great and everybody was friendly. Nick is very proud of his establishment and also shared a family story of the pics he has on wall. I love the fact of how spacious it is and they do not pack you in like sardines. If this was a breakfast spot in Los Angeles they would have added at least 15 more tables so that when you get in and out your seat it's like moving down a movie aisle row with butt in people's face, ridiculous!!! But anyway our fabulous waitress informed us they are moving to a bigger location next year, so I'm sure this will be even better. So I had the biscuits n gravy, they let me sample it first because it is a distinct flavor, and something different. Flavorful and fresh plus they have nice size portions. We will return because we're always in Vegas and I have to try that cinnamon roll totally forgot when we were there.

We stayed at the Mandalay Bay one christmas and I was fortunate enough to stop into Lush while shopping around hotel, and have been hooked ever since. They are so friendly here and offer hand and foot massages with their fantastic products. That is how they first hooked me. I have tried facial products, nail and hand products, bath melts, and my favorite are bath bombs. They are so relaxing and soothing. My favorite is avobath and sex bomb. They are must tries for anyone who loves to be taken away like in the old Calgon commercials.

I have been coming to Vegas for years and have never took the time to stand in front of the Bellagio to see the fountain show. The show only lasts a few minutes so it's definitely worth walking to and posting up in a good spot. The show is pretty amazing and the music is wonderful.

Silly me for not analyzing their reviews better. Over 3500 reviews and 3 1/2 stars, what was I thinking. I was thinking I wanted to spend 80 bucks for 2 at an overrated, overpriced, under flavored buffet. This place is all hype I do not know what anybody finds appealing about this place. Your basically paying for presentation, everything is in cute little pans or baskets and Chinese take out boxes Why?!?!? I'm here to eat,  not get dried up rice in a takeout box. And the pizza was the worst I ever had, little Caesars is way better than that grease dough. Their customer service sucks from the hostess in front to the rude guys behind the food counters. Stay away people remember all those reviews and they barely have three stars. So why 2 stars? The chocolate cookie and their bottled water was very good.

Since I have stayed here a few times I can honestly say this hotel can easily be a five star as far as holiday inn chains. The PROS: all suite rooms, hotel atmosphere and landscaping, parking, location, and room service. CONS: rooms need an upgrade microwave, refrigerator, heater never work. No hot water, computers down, elevator broke, and last but not least and the reason I will not be returning to this location next year is their customer service. Every other Holiday Inn in different states we have visited  has always had exceptional customer service, this place needs a serious attitude adjustment.

If you like the gun range, then you will definitely enjoy MGV. Me and hubby have been wanting to try more than just our regular gun range that we go to in LA. So by recommendation of my marine sniper buddy, we gave it a try. This place is not cheap, but they do have different packages to fit your budget and taste. They sit down with you when you arrive and go over all your options, very nice and patient. They have a lot of cool souvenirs, jewelry, and clothing here. Also a free t-shirt comes with most packages, I love it cute Charlie Angels style. This is a nice size building, but inside shooting area didn't seem that spacious. You get to pick your own targets which is cool because they have some pretty humorous ones. There is an instructor there for your own safety, especially with machine guns, they hold the rounds while you shoot. Hubby enjoyed the AR-15, even though he looked like he could barely handle it, and I have a new favorite which is the beretta, perfect fit for me. We really enjoyed the experience and recommend it for alternative entertainment in Vegas.

If MJ was performing live, it probably could have been five stars, but they get a solid four because of the great tribute. I thought I would see some amazing MJ dance moves, but I guess I expected to much for 150 dollars a pop. With that being said I enjoyed the show although a bit loud, the aerobics were amazing, the glove rolling around stage was a cute touch. My favorite part of show was the neon lit suits and dancers up in the air and on sides of walls, pretty cool. The staff was great, the paparazzi was funny, and I love the overall decor. There is a gift shop with all kinds of cute stuff to purchase. I would suggest the 2nd section of the auditorium to sit in, so you can get the entire presentation of the huge stage show. I was four rows from stage and my head was twisting like the exorcist trying to take it all in.

Parking was ok, did not check out bathrooms, they have plenty of bleachers on both sides of track, and a nice lake behind the bleachers with boaters, pretty cool. Since it is Arizona very dry heat, we brought our tent and set it up on the bleachers at the top, perfect view. There was no announcer the day we went, but at least the speedometer board was working. They have picnic benches under a shaded area at the entrance and a concession stand, not sure what they sold. Hope to come back here for more races next year, very nice scene.

These guys here are the best. Great and fast customer service, very friendly. I ordered several 15 inch sandwiches for a picnic and they came fully loaded. The best part is you get to watch them cut up your choice of deli meat, and they were not skimpy. The 15 inch was cut up in fours, which was perfect so we can sample each. The roast beef and turkey club was very good, they have an optional spicy red  relish sauce, a must try if you like a little kick. I also picked up a lot of their fresh baked cookies. Chocolate chip, white macadamia nut, sugar, and peanut butter. They were all very good, but the peanut butter was just ok. I will be returning when back in town.

Awesome sauce!!!!! My experience was six star/baller style/living it up in Vegas type thing. Okay so let me explain why I'm uber excited about my ride on the Highroller. We came about 11:30 pm no lines at all and since we purchased from Groupon we picked up tickets at concierge, who were very helpful. The staff from entrance to the end we're all great actually. My groupon expired for the promotional value because we did not use last time we were here, but the difference was only 4 bucks, not bad. So when it comes time to board, we jump on, grab a seat on the bench, 2 international women jump on behind us do the same thing, and wham door closes it is just us four to a whole pod. Me and hubby are on one side smiling and snapping pics, gorgeous young girls on other side smiling and dancing. Party on VIP pod number 22 no bar needed, and no entourage included. We are free to slide all over benches, walk all around the pod, enjoying a 360 view at night in Vegas. Now we're almost at 550 feet, the Bellagio fountains are looking spectacular, were taking pictures for the girls and they are doing the same for us, we're all smiling from ear to ear, me and hubby talking, their going crazy in their own native language, and life is good. It is amazing how huge this thing is and how high up you are over the city. My hubby enjoyed the functionality of the wheel itself the most, whatever. I had a great time and I recommend to anyone visiting, however I would avoid the one with the bar since they seem to be the most crowded with the longer lines, but to each his own. Also groupon does run this promotion a lot.

Always wanted to try some ice cream from Ghirardelli, but never got around to it, until now in Vegas. I absolutely love their chocolate so how can they go wrong with cold treats. There is a nice lady passing out chocolate square samples at door and she even took our picture for us, what great service. I wanted to try the sundae, but just opted for the hob nob chill as it is described as a blended sundae. It was very good, very Ghirardelli chocolate good. I will be coming back to try their sundaes, banana splits, and waffle cones. All by the way looked very good as the family next to us devoured those exact items.

Had this place bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas. If your guy loves fast cars this is the place for him to get his eyes full of ford horsepower. We missed the guided tour which I found out is where you can go inside where the mechanics are working and sign their famous wall. We browsed around on our own to check out cars. It's a pretty big place and they just have a small amount of cars to see, but it is free. You can donate to the Shelby charity which is always a plus to give back. And for all you ladies not interested in your man and his love for toys, you can join the others on the couch until he is done. They also have Shelby memorabilia for your shopping pleasure.

I guess I'm like the other hundreds of customers, that ignored the two stars and came to check out White Castle for myself. I have been wanting to try this place for years, so glad when I finally see it in Vegas. Do not come here expecting to have a burger your way with 86 options to choose from, you can venture down the strip if you want to spend 40 bucks on a gourmet burger. This place is serious business here, they have A LOT of employees working in assembly lines preparing burgers, refilling soda machines, stocking up on ketchup, cleaning up as soon as a vacant seat is available, calling out numbers with video screen assistance like the DMV, organized chaos at its finest. The line stayed long, it moved quickly, and the staff was great. I got the cheese sliders, and being a cheese lover I do not think I would enjoy burger as much without it. The fries were mediocre, but probably taste better with toppings. Overall this is a great late night munchies spot and I am sure to return.

Do you like when friends bring back good snacks from out of town and not souvenirs? Yes I do especially when I have been hearing a lot about the popcorn here so was excited to try it. I see the political name is Garrett mix but noticed a lot of people from Chicago call it the Chicago Mix, so we'll go with that. No matter what you call it, it's pretty good stuff, the mixture definitely works well together. It did  seem like it was more caramel popcorn than cheese, and a lot of the caramel was clumped together too much. By the end of the week I will be reviewing a Garrett Popcorn Shop from Chicago so we'll see if Vegas is living up to the originals.

Jon is the only reason I did not give five stars. He is the first person you will encounter at the register and he is miserable and rude. I am glad there is one in LA now because when I come back to Phoenix I will not be returning here. Anyway the food was very expensive but it was very good. The fried buttermilk chicken sandwich could put chic fil a out of business if it was cheaper. The bun was soft just a little too much lettuce. Although cheese fries were good they can definitely stand on their own without sauce, I will order plain next time. The lemonade was also tasty. Plenty of seating, chill decor, and outside seating.
