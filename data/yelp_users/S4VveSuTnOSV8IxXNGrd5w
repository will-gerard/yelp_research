The korean population of arizona eat here, that alone should be enough to check it out. If not, the foods damn good too.

Working out early morning or late nights is the best here. Yeah mid day is crowded with all the classes and trainers out, but thats the beauty of 24/7. Go here almost everyday. Nice, clean, quiet, and the salesmen leave you the hell alone.

I was driving by this place and I haven't washed my car in a long time so I figured why not?   Service wise when I pulled in they were courteous and he told me about a detailing package where they do the whole 9 and I said go for it since I did want to get the seats matts washed too and I had the time today. (Said it was gonna be about an hour since it was slow.) After the initial run through the car wash I sat and watched them work, slowly....very slowly. Sometimes the guy detailing my car would walk away and leave it in attended for 5-7 minutes to talk to the other guys working. But I figured if he has time to do that my car is gonna be immaculate. No, it wasn't, when they told me it was ready I just wanted to leave since it took about 40 minutes over the hour and I noticed dirty windshield, dirty drivers side window, and what I'm going to affectionately call "towel pubes" everywhere. The matts and seats look good but I noticed the area I told them to get specifically hadn't been touched so in my nice clean car there is still that big old soda stain. I paid more than I care to admit for this place and I am never going back.

There's usually a line but they do good work with how busy they are. Granted sometimes they miss a few spots but will fix it if you say something. Over all solid car wash. Plus the gas station right next door has everything you could ever want or need
