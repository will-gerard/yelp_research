By far the best sushi in the east valley! It seems the smaller sushi bars always do better than the larger ones

The last thing you're expecting to hear when you walk into this traditional Japanese restaurant is Dr Dre but I continue to be amazed by this place. Flawless!

Came here expecting to be wow'd and definitely was not let down. We were greeted by our server within 1 minute of being sat down. The crab cake was succulent, as were the oysters. The Chilean Sea bass was made Hong Kong style--which is quite tasty. However my favorite dish of the night was the bananas foster cake!

Roka is definitely on the high end spectrum of Japanese restaurants and for good reason. I will say the menu is pricey but they have a good happy hour if you sit in the bar. The salmon nigiri was perfect and the pork belly melts in your mouth(literally).

Excellent service, good ambiance. The sushi here was above average with decent size rolls and nigiri. I gave 4 stars because the price was very reasonable

Had the turkey sliders appetizer which were decent but the chopped salad and pan seared scallops were phenomenal! Service and ambiance--excellent. Pricing is average considering the location

Sashimi was exceptional, service was great. Only thing I didn't like was the fact that I left still hungry

Very overrated, slow service, tiny portions. I rarely leave a restaurant hungry but definitely did here. I will not be coming back

This is one of my new favorite sushi restaurants. Nigiri and sashimi were top notch, rolls were nicely prepared, and the presentation was phenomenal!

Was eager to eat here because of the executive chef. The duck prosciutto was absolutely amazing! Vanilla and apple creme brulee was to die for

Came here for brunch and it was astonishing! Their menu contains items you probably won't see anywhere else. Their eggs benidict comes with a unique twist and the Nutella crepe-- absolutely delicious

Do Not waste your money or time here! Way overpriced and they rush you through to maximize their profits. I would have been happier spending $20 at the movies.

I came here with high expectations(obviously Binkley's) and was not let down. The mussels appetizer along with the barbecue octopus were magnificent. I will definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu

I was amazed with my experience here. My girlfriend orders the lamb chicken Marsala and I had the chicken Vindaloo. Well her lamb was delicious and my chicken was sub par, so naturally I ate all of hers. The waitress noticed my untouched plate and comped it off the bill and offered to make me something else. I will definitely give this place another chance
