Qdoba was recommended through a co-worker who assured me they were "just as good as Chipotle". Well, being just across Thomas and 10-15 minutes closer made it infinitely more convenient. Almost walkable, if you don't mind getting flattened by the new Light Rail whizzing by. As Stephen Wright says, "Anywhere is walking distance....if you have the time."  Well......about halfway through my fajita ranchera burrito, I'm already sadly disappointed. Taste, quality and price are all below my precious Holy Sepulchre of the Chipotle temple.   First off, I decided to try the fajita, since it's what I get from (angels sing) Chipotle, so it would make the best comparison. I always ask for, and get, some extra peppers/onions for a perfect, albeit "Chain", burrito. So I was a little shocked by the "We'll have to charge you for that" response.   For about 4 pieces of pepper and onion. No joke. Hard times, Qdoba??  The rice is thinner and smaller than Chipotle's, and the burrito instantly fell apart. I guess they need to send their employess to the same rolling-and-folding school that Chipotle includes in their tuition reimbursement benefits.  The final price was over $9, 2 bucks more then I pay at Chipotle for the same - no, better - food.  Sorry, Qdoba, Jeffrey doesn't want burritos with good taste, he wants burritos that taste good! (and cost less)

Worst. Buffet. Ever.  'Nuff said. No...scratch that, I must vent. Or Yelp.  Wow, what a disaster. My workmate and I were craving a buffet today, and on the way into work I had passed the Golden Coin and thought it looked like any standard cheap buffet from the outside. But I was fooled, it's not just ANY cheap buffet, it's THE cheap buffet.   Well, as Roger Daltrey says, "I won't get fooled again!"  The sign outside says $4.86 buffet, lunch or dinner. For less than a Lincoln, it's worth a try, right? (Wrong!) First of all, cash only, people, no plastic. And here's the ENTIRE buffet list:  Rice (of the brown fried variety, bland) Lo Mein (I'm not sure what that taste is, but it ain't Lo Mein) Egg Rolls (small, cut in half, and awful. And there's that "taste" again...) Fried Chicken (the only food of redeeming quality) Wings (again, bland, though decent in size) Sweet and Sour Pork (I'll get to this in a second)  Yep, that's it. The whole buffet. And no refills on the sodas, either. Some greasy chinese crispy noodles. No soup. (Hey, no soup means not having to provide spoons!)  The fried chicken wasn't bad, but other than that, I wouldn't serve this food to prisoners. Except the ones on death row, and that's to save money on electricity.  I'm not quite sure what the deal was with the Sweet and Sour Pork. The sauce was the consistency of water, the meat was......wait, I don't want to know.   If I could give it 1/1000th of a star, I'd do it. Steer clear, and your digestive system will thank you.

For this review, I will simply cut/paste my letter I sent to Lexus regarding my recent 60,000 mile "service." Simply put, if you don't mind paying $600 for a "service", then feel free to use these criminals.  "We recently had a 60,000 mile service performed at Bell Lexus in Phoenix. I am completely appalled at the prices your company and this dealer charged us. $386.82 for what amounts to a glorified oil change. I feel like I need a police officer, since I was just robbed. There is nothing done in this service that isn't done by a standard Jiffy Lube oil change for $40.  Labor costs of $257.40 for a couple hours (if that much) of checking and topping off fluids!!?? Is this some kind of sick joke??  $125 to program a key that already cost us hundreds of dollars??? 10 seconds of typing onto a keyboard for $125??  My total bill breakdown is $444.90 of labor, $169.37 parts. (that include some oil and 2 wiper blades)Another $40 of "misc charges".   I am appalled, and will NEVER visit any Lexus dealer for any kind of service again. And I will post my bill information on every review site I can find.   Your company should be ashamed and embarassed. And no, some kid in a tux with a muffin and coffee when I arrive does NOT help.  Jeff Clay Invoice # LECS210612 Invoice date 6/23/10"

Went on Sunday to watch Week 1 of the '09 NFL season, and was pleasantly surprised. I used a coupon from www.Restaurant.com, and saved  $10 off my $25 check. (bevs not included)  The food was good to excellent. Wings were fantastic, big and meaty, with great sauce, and were only about $6 and change for a dozen. The nachos were a giant pile of goodies, and could barely get through half of it. I didn't have any alcohol, as I had my 3 yr old with me, but I did feel totally comfortable with him there  -  great family atmosphere even though it was croweded. Everyone was good little boys and girls, and very friendly crowd.  There are plenty of tvs surrounding both dining rooms, and there are plenty of teams represented, it's not one of those bars devoted to just one team. Again...friendly banter between different teams followers, no yelling, screaming, fighting or even arguing. Heck, I'm a Ravens fan and even chatted it up with (gasp!) a Pittsburgh fan! What's next, dogs and cats, sleeping together??  Good service, lots of waitresses flying around, and everyone seemed to be having a blast cheering on their teams.

Looks like I'm going along with the crowd on this one. Ate at the Frank Lloyd Wright location yesterday, and that will be the last time they see my smiling face walk through their doors.  The service was awful, and started when the waitress who sat us gave us the "Oh lord, you have a CHILD???" She actually told us to enjoy our meal, unfortunately she was already 10 feet away with her back to us when she said it. Wow...never felt that welcome before!  The food (a small thin crust shrimp scampi pizza, a child's cheese pizza and a salad with chicken) took forever. And when it finally arrived, it was a whole lot less than satisfying.  The salad was bland, with two pieces of chicken and 12 tons of lettuce. The child's pizza was okay, but how can you screw that one up, right? The scampi pizza was another story entirely.  When you order a $15.00 pizza, you expect to maybe have a couple slices left over for tomorrow's lunch, right? Not at ol' Picazzo's! Here's a pic of the pathetic pie. FIFTEEN DOLLARS, ladies and gentlemen. That's $1 per shrimp! What a bargain!!  I've had microwave pizzas you cook on that little gray paper box that were tastier and crisper. Soggy...bland....tiny....nothing redeeming whatsoever.  Needless to say, we won't be back to Pizza Peeweecazzo. Ugh.

Just visited the FP on Pima on Saturday for lunch. We hadn't been in a while, but have never had a bad meal there. The streak continues.  First off, they are not afraid of trying new things at Four Peaks, and I've never experienced a failed experiment. Also, the service has always been efficient, fast and friendly.  Btw...major kudos to them for putting their kids menus on the back of those little magnetic/erasable drawing tablets. Kept my 2 1/2 year old busy for at least 10 minutes - and that's saying something!!   We tried the shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta, which tasted even better than it sounds. And it wasn't anything we expected. Bruschetta is usually some slivers of bread, with a few toppings. Good, sure, but this thing was a mountainous monstrosity of dee-lish-us-ness. Imagine a plate of tacos, but the chips are bruschetta bread, and the toppings are diced tomatoes in olive oil, plenty of chunks of goat cheese, and 6 large succulent shrimp. Heaven, but almost too much!  I took the server's suggestion and tried the beer bread steak sandwich, which was essentially a cheese steak with onions and peppers served in a delicious homemade "beer bread" - kind of like a moist, soft, ,chewy tortilla. As Cookie Monster would say, and I quote, "YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!"  My wife had the panko-crusted sea bass salad, which she raved about after every bite. And the wife is one of those unlucky-at-food, who rarely gets anything that tastes like she thinks it's going to taste. Even the cheeseburger and fries was devoured by my kid.  For the first time, I didn't try a beer here, but I was sorely tempted by the Pumpkin Ale on tap. If not for the heartburn and lack of Tums citrus, I would have gladly quaffed a pint.  Love this place!!

Recently popped in for a spur-of-the-moment dinner, mostly because it's right around the corner, and happy to have the Greene House as a neighbor!  Love the ambience, and open feel of the restaurant, especially with the open wall to the outside. The great weather this week obviously helped, not sure how comfy that can be in the summer, but we enjoyed the fresh air. And might I mention the people watching - if you like a lot of stretched-tight skin in various places.  Also, I always seem to like a nice restaurant with the open kitchen that seems to be part of the restaurant. All it needs is a screaming Gordon and I'd feel like I'm in Hell's Kitchen. And I mean that in a good way. I love to see the flames of the various dishes being cooked.  Drinks were good, had a perfectly made dirty martini, albeit a little on the small side. For an appetizer, we ordered the warm brie. It came with perfectly toasted bread, sour cherries and garlic. Mixing all 3 onto the bread seemed like the perfect threesome. (Hey, minds out of the gutter please, I'm talking about the brie)  Entrees - I had the chicken and prosciutto ravioli which were delicious, however I would have liked more prosciutto taste and less chicken. Almost had no prosciutto-y flavor. Still loved it, but I do love me some thin italian meat. (geez, will you stop with the snickering?)  The other dishes ordered at our table were the Seared Ahi Tuna which comes on a bed of stir-fry veggies that I was told was mouth watering, and the roast beef sandwich with fontina cheese. I asked my wife how it was, and all I got was a wide eyed nod as if she didn't want to even open her mouth to waste one taste.  And my little one devoured the mac-n-cheese, penne type pasta drenched in melted cheese, topped with parmesan. (also available with grilled andouille sausage).   And kudos to the GH for the meal size. I love a meal where you finish full, but not stuffed. Everything was the perfect size. Service was great with plenty of attention without being annoying. We didn't leave room for dessert, but the warm cinnamon and sugar donut with vanilla custard sounded very tempting. I just wanted to be able to walk out of the restaurant under my own power...

This was my third visit to O&I, and the first time experiencing the "brunch menu." Plenty of lunchable dishes, tho, so while my 3 yr old devoured the perfect thick pancakes with custard and blueberry compote, my wife and I enjoyed two tasty flatbreads - mine with prosciutto (bellissima!) and hers with short rib (get 'r dun!).  The serving size was generous, she barely finished hers and she hadn't eaten yet that day (we arrived around 2 pm), and I got to bring home 3 pieces for a nice snack later. (which she scammed from me!! lucky I love her....)  Everything was cooked perfectly, and delicious. The decor of the place is top-notch, making me feel like I just had my living room decorated by Vern Yip from Trading Places. (always love his designs) Lots of hanging candles, rustic furniture, and an open air feel with a large outdoor patio.  The bakery has a nice assortment  of freshly baked goodies (my son loved the gingerbread man cookies - and I must say, they were still warm and soft - best I ever had) and even gave me a free homemade biscuit for my "best friend" at home.   And the prices, though a tad bit steep, are very reasonable for the food quality. Lunch for 3 of us, including a glass of wine and a quenching rasberry mojito was about $60.  The service was just okay, not too attentive, and the waiter, tho friendly, committed one of my most hated pet peeves. As I've said in a review for Ernie's, you are NOT impressing me 1 bit by memorizing my order. Do they not give waiters/waitresses pens and paper anymore??? You could have saved yourself a few percentage points in the tip, if you you didn't have to come back to me 10 minutes later and ask me AGAIN what I ordered. Or say "You ordered the..........(long pause waiting for me to fill in the blank)...." Nope! (buzzer) The Jones Family gets a chance to steal!!!  To all servers. Please. I'm begging you. Write down my order. In crayon if you want. Tattoo it on your forearm. Whatever it takes. Just please don't come back to me asking what I ordered. 5 minutes after my meal, I won't remember you, and I won't run home to nominate you for a mensa membership. I just want what I ordered.  (stepping off my soapbox now)

Abondanza!   Already hooked on Cici's. We tried it for the first time a few weeks back when they had a $3.99 special and we go every week now. Cheap, decent quality, awesome quantity and incredibly friendly people. (and NFL Network on the tv don't hurt)  Buffet style pizza, two types of salad - premixed with either ranch or italian dressing, some kind of corkscrew pasta that's the one lowlight - just avoid it and save the tummy space for the 'za, and cinnamon rolls and brownies that are to die for. Oh, and aycd fountain drinks and tea (sweet tea, too!), of course. There's always bread sticks and some sort of stuffed-pizza'y-squares-concoction that I kinda dig, too.  It's not the greatest pizza on the planet, but there's plenty of it and plenty of variety. I like the buffalo chicken, mac and cheese, and veggie as my favorite little triangles of goodness. You'll be greeted with lots of hello's and smiles when you walk in, everyone is super friendly and will get you anything you need if you don't see it on the buffet. They keep the pizza fresh and rarely will you see an empty pan on the counter.  For the money, it's a steal, they just need bigger plates! It's always interesting to watch the gluttons build a "Leaning Tower of Pizza" rather than just eat a few slices and make their way back.  Ciao! (or, i guess it should be, Chow!)

Pretty disappointing - I thought this was supposed to be a newly renovated Wet n' Wild?? We've been to the Wet n' Wild in Orlando several times, and that park is what a water park should be. This is a poor imitation.  We were looking for something to do with our 3 yr old, who is like a fish in the pool. We figured enough time has gone by since the opening that things at WnW should be running smoothly. We got our tix online, (saved a couple bucks) but the total for 2 adults and one child was still $94. And then $5 for parking, and $6 for a small locker, that takes a bite out of the wallet.  This WnW is maybe half the size of the Orlano park. We'd been here when it was Waterworld, and they didn't increase the size one inch, it seems. Just replaced a few slides with some updated ones. Now, I have to say that we didn't even try any of the brand new stuff - most of which looked like a lot of fun - because we were there solely for our kid to have fun. But the lines for all these slides were very long. I talked to some people on the slides, and they said the avg wait was about :30 per slide. Standing in Phx heat for 30 minutes, for a 30 second slide doesn't sound too cool to me.  A couple things we noticed right off the bat - in the lazy river and the wave pool, the bottom is chock full of holes and large unpainted spots. Didn't they even paint these things before they reopened as WnW?? Not very impressive.  Also - the "kids" that work this place were, for the most part, completely uninterested in their jobs. Now...if you're manning the fry bin at McD's, and the fries cook a little too long, no biggie. But when you have toddlers going down water slides in the kid section, and they're basically beating the crap out of each other to get down the slides and not waiting til the first kid gets out of the way first, causing chaos in the form of little toddler bodies in a crumpled heap.....not good. Not once did I see the girl watching the toddler slide stop the madness once. If you have a small child here...WATCH THEM CLOSELY.  I give them 2 stars because my kid had such a ball, and we'll probably buy a season pass next year. (3 visits and it's more than paid for) It's worth it for us to come there 4 or 5 times a year for my son to play, but if I have to wait 30 minutes every time I go down one of the adult slides, that's gonna get old verrrrry fast. At least the lazy river is available.

Being from Baltimore, (Hon!), I've been dying to try this place, and what better time than on a Sunday for Ravens football. There was a small crowd, and lots of other Baltimorons wearing purple Ravens jerseys and cheering on my home team.  The decor is bar/pub, and I did like the open-air aspect, since it kept the cigarette smoke to a minimum. Everyone was very friendly, and there were plenty of nice tv's to watch the game on.  The food was very good, I had the MD style steamed shrimp, which came w/ lots of onions (very baltimore...), good amount of spice, and were tasty, though a tad overcooked. The sliders were excellent, and the wings were meaty and tasty...yet not what I ordered...which brings me to the service.  If I could give a separate rating for the service, there would be a whole lot of grey and verrry little orange on them stars above. The waiter/bartender took a while to even stop by our table (of which there were only about 3 or 4 with people at them), and didn't bother to write down our order. Ummm...time to retake that memory course, because he came back about 15 minutes later to "go over our order", and didn't get one thing correct. So just when we thought food was being delivered, it hadn't even been ordered yet.  I ordered a slider w/cheese (how they come anyway) for my son, and it arrived without cheese. (strike one) I ordered the Maryland wings (with old bay) and they brought regular buffalo wings. (strike two) My wife ordered the taco salad, which the menu states comes in one of those tortilla bowls, and it looked like an order of nachos from Taco Bell on some chips with FREEZING cold meat. (strike three)   Three separate times, they came by with an order of crab dip (that looked tasty) asking if we ordered it. Guess the first two times they didn't believe us. He very rarely came by our table to notice my empty beer glass, maybe they were short on Fat Tire? I don't know.  So...great food, especially for a Baltimore-boy, yet horrible horrible service. Please, WRITE DOWN MY ORDER!! You're not impressing me when you try to memorize it. Especially when you go 0-for-3 in guessing what we ordered - and maybe check with me a few minutes later instead of when the food should be on my table.  4 out of 5 for the food, and as Dean Wormer said to Mr. Blutarsky about his grade point average...... Zero....Point.....Zero.....for the service. Hoping this is just bad luck, as I'll probably be back next Sunday to watch the Ravens beat down the Steelers, but I'll bring a pen and paper for you, Mr. Bartender. Please write it down.
