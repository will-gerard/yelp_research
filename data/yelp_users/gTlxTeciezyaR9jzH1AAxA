The war wonton soup is the best in the Valley! Their portions are huge and we always have massive amounts of left overs. Try the chef specialties like the seafood platter and the special China chow mien. My favorite here is the Crispy Duck, Orange chicken and house lo mein. Yum!

Really liked this Place! Make sure to call ahead because it gets booked quickly or you may have a 15 min wait. I personally go to MyMy, she is really detailed and very patient. Place is clean and very affordable, I think Pedis start at 18+ . They have new pedicure chairs and the staff is always nice. It's not the best place in the valley but they focus on you and don't try to rush you out-and they sanitize their tools! Place is very clean and prices are very inexpensive! Can't believe I got a deluxe pedi for less than $30 ( including tip)!

Wow! I spoke to the owner about a discrepancy I thought I had with the price of shipping. He broke down the store process and how each UPS store is individually owned and operated. There is a small service fee on postage due to the service they provide. Going to the post office is likely a little bit cheaper, however the post office has long lines and not the best customer service. He also gave me some pointers on which priority mail boxes to use to get the best price on shipping.  They do offer regular mail and UPS, as well as copies, office and shipping supplies and PO BOX services. Great customer service and they allowed me to drop off a package I had already placed postage on. This place is great as they do have everything on sight for your shipping and small business needs. Glad I spoke to the owner as I was able to see everything from a different perspective! They let you know when the mail carriers come and sometimes the UPS carrier comes more than once in a day so you are able to get your items sent out quicker.   Owner was very honest and very nice despite my concern and several questions about shipping! Thank you for your patience! You guys are awesome!

Loved this place, very quaint and cute for a get together. I had their springrolls and they were made fresh. I also ordered #26 the crispy & spicy stir fried veggies and noodles, AMAZING. I loved the family atmosphere and the hospitality was great. I even got my tea to go! If you want to try something more authentic and with exceptional service, make sure to stop by at Little Saigon!

This was extremely disappointing. Went last night with a family member to grab dinner and to share a couple items from the menu. For an appetizer we ordered the potato cakes, which I really enjoyed and they are now about 8 in an order instead of 3 (they used to be served as 3 potato pancakes). The slaw that came with the potato cakes was refreshing but lacked flavor. We also ordered the clam chowder and a side house salad. The clam chowder looked like it had been sitting for a while and straight out of a can! I returned the house salad because it looked like wilted iceberg lettuce drenched in ranch ( I had ordered the dressing on the side). We ordered the tri tip and grilled shrimp, at about 25.00 for the entrée I was expecting an amazing meal. The shrimp were insignificant and the tri-tip extremely salty. We ordered the ice cream and cookie dessert but it still fell short. The atmosphere is nice and the place is elegant and clean. Our server Jordan was great, he was very attentive and always stopped to check on our meal and drinks. Although service was very good, I don't think I will be coming back.

I love Julia Bakers Chocolates, and the ambience is gorgeous and fun for girl time, but I was really disappointed this time around. We ordered the red velvet cake and I've had it before but today it was not very special. The cake was extremely dry and crumbly. When I asked the young lady attending us about the cake, she apologized and stated that it was a couple of days old. She said the last order came in on Tuesday, it was Saturday afternoon... which I was very disappointed because I remembered it very moist and dense like a cheesecake. This was definitely not very good. My latte was ok, nothing special ( the last time I had ordered the latte it was creamy and delicious). The caramel chocolates are my favorite and always something we take to go here. My friend loved the Sorelle Prosecco but I was not happy with the cake and my bland latte. I may not be coming in for cake (unless it's fresh). Make sure to ask for freshness!

Came here for a birthday dinner. Just wanted to say Carlos and the entire Restaurant exceeded our expectations! From start to finish our server was extremely patient and accommodating with 6 VERY undecided gals. The food was spectacular, we each ordered something different and even ordered their shrimp appetizer special twice! Make sure to order the cornbread pudding, it needs to be a side for everything! We never felt rushed and everyone seemed happy to be there. The service and hospitality definitely Wowed not only me but all the guests including the Birthday Girl. Thank you so much for making the evening a pleasant and delicious experience!

Kabuki, Kabuki... it is always a go to place for my friends and fam especially since we live out in the west valley. Although it's a corp establishment (I'm a huge fan of local eateries) it still has me coming back. I come here a lot, and it's not always my fave but it's always open and open later than most sushi places in the west valley. Many people complain about portion size, and they have made many changes since the new menu came out a couple of months ago. But I have to say the chefs are meticulous about taste and plating. If something isn't to your liking, then by all means send it back! I have had some issues ordering premium rolls that were very small in portion while other times the portions were very generous. I have noticed it depends on how busy the restaurant is. The place is clean and the service is always hit or miss. Sometimes it's amazing service and other times it's awful.   Anyways last night we sat at the sushi bar (after a 45 min wait) but it was a busy Friday night. Alfredo was our sushi chef and he def made us feel welcomed. He is so nice and personable. Some sushi chefs don't even acknowledge you there but he constantly asked us if we needed anything and how the food was. We had some premium rolls, the lotus on fire, hamachi salmon box, and rose roll. Wish they could make custom rolls but they do offer to have sides with your rolls (spicy sauces, jalapeño slices, lemon slices, tobiko etc) The sushi to my taste has always been good (it isn't the best) but it's a great place to go for happy hour and enjoy sushi with friends.

Very dissapointed in service, although I believe they are currently understaffed..  I am a regular and decided to make the order over the phone and was placed on hold for 5 min. I decided to run errands while on hold... Still no answer. I walked in and there was no one in line. As I asked the lady in the front counter. She said that she had to take preference to the several customers that were there at the time and phone calls were not a priority. I stated she could of offered a call back or take a quick note, I was surprised at her comment and told her I'm so dissapointed since we have been regulars for so long. She told me to call the number on the menu if I wanted to complain... I decided to cancel my order and go elsewhere... The food is genuinely good, but the service is just very poor. Decided to drive over to the Mercado inside of Desert Sky mall to order the Tortas there, where the quality and customer service Is excellent...

After several returns I have to say I'm definitely impressed! They are fully staffed and the customer service has improved. Everyone including the chef said thank you after I picked up my order today! I really like this place because the food is consistent and the portions are great for what you pay.The place is clean and everything on the menu is Delish! This is your best option if you are closer to Avondale to get fresh pan dulce, gelato, antojitos, and dinner for the fam. There is something for everyone and the food has always had me come back. I'm a sucker for service so I'm extremely happy they were great and offered to let me sample the aguas frescas. I will be back!

I simply love this place! I find myself coming here at least twice a week for lunch and sometimes go back for dinner when I have to brag to my friends and family what I ate for lunch.  5 stars for price, cleanliness, fast and efficient service, and delicious food.  There's no other place in cenpho that you can pay less than 10.00 for lunch for TWO people!   The Banh mi is irrestible and filled enough with meat and veggies to be a solid steal for $2.25   The Pho-is PHO-licous!!!! Yes it leaves Da Vang, Maxim and 43 Express in the dust.  Another steal at just $4.50  The #59 Broken Rice Special is divine-especially if you want to get a little taste of everything for only $6.95  Great place for a great price!

This location does not offer in store returns/exchanges for products purchased online. I was provided this location via the GNC phone number located on the website. The staff member named Carlos didn't even know his store policies and would not review my receipt. Was extremely condescending and rude for items that were purchased with an extended holiday return period. Will not be purchasing items from GNC as they do not warrant their items or customer satisfaction.

Ron came to the rescue for a clogged toilet AND clogged bathroom shower.   Note before I called him we Googled and looked up everything! Struggled for a night and did everything from dish soap, baking soda/vinegar to pouring lye down the drain. Thanks to our amazing Yelpers, I messaged Ron late that night and he was available the next morning.  He showed up to our home right on time and is very professional and kind! No gimmicks or tricks he unclogged and fixed both bathrooms in less than 30 min. He also provided us with advice to maintain our plumbing. His tips were greatly appreciated and I will definitely recommend him to everyone I know. Thank you so much Ron!

After hearing so many good things about this place my mom and I made the drive to come out here. My moms Peruvian friend brought her here a couple of months back and my mom said that I had to come try for myself.   It's a small family style atmosphere, however the service was awful. I'm not from South America and not familiar with many of the selections and when we asked the waitress what she would recommend she stated that most people know what they want when they come there.   I decided to go on yelp and see the options that were available based on pics since my mom didn't remember what she had the last time she came. We ordered the ceviche which was great and the chicha morada drink was very good as well. We ordered the seafood Jalea which looked amazing and grand. However was completely smothered in salt, so salty it was inedible. The shrimp was also not cleaned and prepared properly. So disappointing because the portion was generous and it looked divine. We then ordered the pesto pasta which was awful as the Pasta and steak was overcooked and very bland. I was beyond disappointed and couldn't believe the lack of service. Our waitress sat in a corner and ate and we had to flag her down just to get refills of water. I advised our waitress of the quality of food and she stated that was how it was prepared and served.   I decided to order dessert because I am a huge fan of Alfajores, let me say the order of 2 Alfajores were PERFECTION! That's the only part of the entire meal that was amazing. The buttery shortbread style cookie (it's made out of maizena cornstarch) and cajeta were just perfect together. That is the only reason I would ever come back because they were that good. I would give one star for lack of service and quality of food for the price we paid but I am giving 2 for the amazing Alfajores. I probably won't be coming back though, too far and pricey for lack of service and quality of food.

Love this place! So quaint and clean! The owners are soooo nice! Love their demeanor and how happy they are about their donuts and for you to enjoy them. After talking to the owner and trying their donuts and boba Thai tea I learned a lot about the business! Let's just say Fresh Donut Is the SECRET behind many other local donut shops across the Valley. Will definitely stop by to say hi and have a fresh old fashioned donut!

Love this place! Best Bakery in the West Valley! Anything you can Dreem up they can make it! I'm having a custom cake done for a wedding and cant wait to see the final product! They can make Wedding cakes, Cupcakes, even Quinceanera cakes! Tina is amazing and goes above and beyond for her clients. They are open late at night and are walking distance from the Harkins Theatre. Not sure whats up with the neg reviews but I have had no problem and love their creative flavors. Dont let some bad reviews fool you, They are better than any corp location and am happy to see an actual family owned business thriving! Their specialty cupcakes are not only fabulous but they taste amazing! Red Velvet and Salted Caramel are among my favorites. Especially the Strawberry and White chocolate is delicous (theres actual strawberries in the batter not pink food coloring)! If you dont want to pay $3 for a cupcake then this place isnt for you, If you like gourmet and quality ingredients with fancy touches then this is your Bakery! 5 stars for amazing customer service, very cute interior, creative cupcakes, cleanliness and affordable pricing for custom orders.

I LOVE PHO! This place is definitely the BEST Pho in the West Valley. I often travel all across AZ to get a good bowl of Pho. Song Lynn is among my favorite Pho spots and it is your best option if you live in the far West Valley. Its clean, modern, service is quick and they accommodate an array of options from vegetarian, gluten free etc.The Banh mi are fresh and the bread is so soft and crispy. The Spring Rolls are made to order and the portions of Pho are quite generous. We usually order appetizers and share a large bowl of pho P1 or P12. The Curry is fantastic and the Song Lynn Special (S1) Is amazing, Its a nest of noodles and fresh stir fried veggies with your choice of meats. I love how they already know what I usually order and how I like it prepared. I love extra limes and jalapenos and they always accompany my pho. They are very attentive and  I come here several times per week because the food is consistently delicious! Happy Hour is from 3-7pm but prices are great all day. You can literally have a Vietnamese feast for less than $25 bucks!

There's finally a great donut place on the West, West Valley! I used to have to drive to the maryvale area for donuts but thank goodness Daily Donut is here in Avondale! These donuts are made fresh daily! Still fresh when I got there around 11am. I had the ham and cheese jalapeño crossaint which was light and flaky (not so greasy) and of course a dozen of their signature donuts. My favorite are the old fashioned and they are light and not overbearingly sweet. I can eat them all day! You have to stop by and try them out AND they have boba! All reasonably priced. Great to have a local family owned establishment that's clean and Terry and Hank are such nice people! Excellent customer service!

All I can say is WOW, this place needs to be in its own category when it comes to Indo-Pak Cuisine. I've come back several times and have driven 45 min just to have their Chicken Biryani. The Pakoras are very light and their Tandoori Chicken is not extremely spicy or over powered with red tandoori sauce. I just had the Chicken Karahi last night which was perfect with Naan. I always call ahead because its best for takeout. Great food takes time and they take their time to make sure it is prepared adequately. I promise its worth the wait. The restaurant is quaint and comforting, almost as if you are coming over for family dinner. The portions are generous and customer service is always great. I always try to have something new but the Chicken Biryani is a MUST to accompany any dish here. 5 stars because the food is consistently Amazing, they are clean, offer great service, portions are generous and prices just cant be beat! Can't wait to go back!

What can I say... I LOVE tacos! And these definitely do not disappoint. The tacos are huge! I mean MUCHO MACHO huge! I ordered 6 thinking they were small basic tacos and I was wrong. They are packed with flavor and each one has its own flair. I really liked the Pastor (sweet and flavorful with green papaya) they even have sriracha here too! The 50/50 was perfect, great combo of flavors with the pico and queso fresco. A great ( and clean ) place by another local owner! Wish I had more room to try dessert, I also had a fresh batch of Horchata topped with pecans (sooo good and refreshing) . Dan and his staff are super friendly and want to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. If you are in the downtown/uptown area this is def a great taco spot.

Finally! A fusion of my dream street tacos! The ambiance is casual and the staff def make you feel at home. I came twice, once on first Friday with the Fayuca concert and again to watch Thursday night football. This is a great place for everyone, depending on the night and the occasion it caters to every palate. First off-the Pork Belly! It is PHENOMENAL, by far one of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had. The Fish taco is also up there in taste. The calamari and shrimp were good but were nothing out of this world. Then the drinks.... I had the Margarita Popper, which is the margarita with jalapeños, sounds insane but the sweetness, tartness, mixed with citrus and jalapeño heat was Amazing! If you aren't into spicy drinks, the margarita bramble was sweet and on point. Make sure you ask for Vanessa as the drinks were perfectly made. On first Friday they also had a special on house margaritas for like $3 bucks! Make sure to stop by and order the margarita popper and the pork belly tacos!

Wow! This place is the real deal-Portions are huge! I had the Rueben which was AMAZING! Not overly greasy and the corned beef was perfection! They have an office special ( $100 for 12 people) that I can't wait to order!  This place is a must try if you are craving a real deli sandwich. I'm ecstatic we finally have a deli on the west side!

This place is the cutest! Love their little basket boutique shop and everything on the Menu. This was my first time here and the manager made sure I felt welcomed, the staff described some menu options and even offered me some samples. I had the Avocado Bacon Sandwich and Tomato Basil soup and the sandwich was huge! Overflowing of fresh pulled turkey and lots of avocado! This place also has a boutique set up to make gift baskets with fresh baked goods, home décor, jewelry and lots of other goodies. Great to come with a group or to stop and grab a quick gift for someone special. I loved my experience here and will definitely be back.

This place was great and service was exceptional. I went with a group of co workers and had the Short Rib Special. Although it was great, my serving was a little burned and tough on the texture. I also had their deep fried mac and cheese balls and they were AMAZING. For dessert we had an array of desserts from their cheesecake, apple pie, baked cookie and my fave buttermilk pie. The cheesecake was perfection, but the PIE..... The Buttermilk Pie was hands down the best thing on the menu. I loved the crust and texture. I believe it is the chefs personal family recipe and I will def be back for some pie!

Great place if you are looking for authentic D.F. style Mexican Food. This is their new location and they have another location inside the Mercado De Los Cielos at Desert Sky Mall. Their specialty are the Quesadillas, Huaraches and Barbacoa. They offer great service, great food and the Portions are INSANE!  If you order a Quesadilla or Huarache you are sure enough to be able to feed 2-3 people. Everything is made from scratch even the Tostadas! I personally don't like tostadas because they get soggy, but not here- The lady advised us that they are made in house and she was right they stay crisp till the end!  I have ordered the Barbacoa for events and it is the real deal. They give you all the fixings and prices are so cheap! Great hole in the wall if you are looking for something different from the typical Sonoran style food here in the Valley.

I love Kneaders! However this place is definitely new. New on Management and Operations. It  took me over 35 min to get a gift card and a pie to go... I had to wait until the pie could be boxed, they had no boxes and once the pie was placed in a large cake box the pie crusts began to fall apart onto the counter. After waiting so long I just wanted to leave so I didn't make a fuss.   The Pumpkin Pie was delicious! It was smooth and creamy and the pie crust (what was left of it) was perfectly baked. I will be back to buy some pie and other pastries. I usually order to go and call ahead to make sure its ready. It can be a hassle but I rather check then waste my time at the counter. I love their boutique items and gift baskets. Looking forward to the holiday breads and cookies from Kneaders!
