They picked up my documents, and got them to the mortgage company before the promised delivery time. I would use them again. Website is easy to use as well.

We have found our little Italian place!!!   So, we walked in and almost left, there was no one there. We decided as it was a Monday night we would stay. No drinks except water, however the waiter practically begged me to let him go to the corner market and get me a sprite. I thought this is a good sign to just have water. My wife is a vegetarian, when she inquired about the sauce, our waiter said it was not  vegan however it was vegetarian, he was very nice and wanted to be sure she got something she would like.  Our starter was this really nice bread with Parmesan, butter, and roasted garlic. it was quite good, however we did feel a little guilty, but it was worth it. =)  We decided to share the Gnocchi, and the Really Big 5 cheese ravioli. The Ravioli was good, but it was over matched by the Gnocchi which was served with tomato sauce with some pesto added.  Each dish was $12  We will be making this our neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The decor was nice modern art, and it seemed like the Cure's greatest hits was on during most of our meal. (which was fine, but odd)

My wife is a vegetarian, and I am not. We can always agree on Carly's everything we have tried has been good. The service is always very nice, and they let us go at whatever speed we want, whether it is a quick lunch or a nice leisurely dinner.

This place is great!! I have taken several people and everyone has loved it. Vegetarians as well as meat eaters all enjoy Cornish Pasty Company. There is a ton of choices, even if you are not feeling the pasty have the side of mashed potato's there are great as well.

We went by this place a hundred times, and always commented on the fact that we should go there. We went on Valentines 2007 for the first time. We have been there twice since. The restaurant has gone above and beyond our expectations every time. I am a bit of a picky eater, I will eat ANYTHING they serve.  Bakd is run by a catering company, they use the restaurant to try out new ideas on their patrons. You must make reservations ahead of time, I have always spoken to Chef Tim when doing this, he has always been nice and accommodating even when changing reservations multiple times.  Depending on how many reservations they have they will ask what protein you would like, or just tell you. =) (they are always accommodating of  vegan and vegetarian diets)  Typically they will serve 5 - 7 courses and the chef will come out and explain the dish and his thought process in creating the dish. We have always felt apart of the process. Never has a single course been bad. We have stolen several of their ideas and used them in our own kitchen. The chefs are open to discuss where they shop, what they look for.   This is by far the most compelling, unique, exciting, wonderful, and amazing dining experience I have ever had.  I encourage everyone I know who enjoys food to go there.  The store front is small and intimate, it does not feel like being in downtown Mesa at all.   The price is $45 a person, and well worth it. I do not normally pay this much for a meal, but this is no normal meal!   Please go and enjoy this is to good not to be packed every night.

The different terrain is nice, our dogs had a good time there, however there were no other dogs there! We have been there twice. No dogs either time.

Because of Tait. I will never change brands of car. I want them to always take care of my cars. I live in downtown Phoenix, and I am happy to drive out to Tempe. Tait tells you what is going on, what can wait, what should not. I have NEVER felt like I was charged to much. I have always felt like auto care was to expensive. Not any more, if you have a Honda or Acura take it to Tait. If you drive something else trade it in, get a Honda or Acura and go to Tait. He is truly our Honda Super Hero.  Tait is the owner, and has always been my point of contact there.

There was a bone in my meatball after they burned my sub the first go around. When I brought this up to the manager he said " well we do not make the meatballs here, they come in pre-made". I did not receive an apology or any effort to make it right, or keep us as a customer. We will not be going there again.  It is sad as Z Pizza looks great from the outside, however the food is average at best, barring any foreign items in your meal, and the service is unorganized, and lacking any courtesy.

Dual review for Mesa and Central Phoenix Locations:  I have never noticed a difference in food for either location. Some like it hot is true!!!!  I have been on about a six year love affair with the adovada ribs. This is the dish to get here, if you are excited about the the heat, and want something amazing.  My wife who is not as into the heat, or meat and has been quite happy with Bean and Cheese Burro, and cheese crisp. Margarita's are good but expensive. We have had many a great evening there drinking and waiting for a table.   Central location: Great atmosphere, wonderful area to wait for your table, and you will wait as there is not very much seating inside. Evenings they will open the bar so you can get chips, salsa, and drinks. I think my favorite part is sitting out side and waiting,until I eat the food then the wait does not matter any more.  Mesa location:  Much bigger, and more seating it is in an auto strip mall, no waits there, however not as nice and welcoming as the central location, in fact they have painted a mural of the central location (I heard it was Tom Mix's house) on the wall inside the Mesa location. The food has always been just as good. However given the option I would drive out to south mountain every time.  Great place that we will be going to for many years to come.

I was there April 4th, and 5th. I saw a ton of funny and amazing shows. It was a great mix of local and national troupes. I did not think there was any difference in terms of quality between the troupes from Phoenix, and the ones from Chicago and LA. I am going to try and see some of the local groups in town and would suggest others to go and check them out. I will be going back to PIF next year as well! It was a good price, and the theatre was full for most performances.

We have our new slice of Heaven!!!  They also deliver to our house which is even better.  After reading reviews on yelp the wife and I decided to check it out. Great little place very friendly people. We were escaping our inferno of an apartment, the ac was not performing up to our igloo like standards. So, we put a bunch of ice in the dogs water bowls and went off on our new yelp adventure.  Pizza A Metro was a great choice. They gave us tons of water to calm our sweltering hearts and served us amazing food.  To start a pizza crust cut up served with a cold onion bruschetta (the best i can describe) it was very good, but I could not eat a lot of it, however the wife loved it.  Salad: next we shared their least expensive salad, nice leafy spring mix with onions,  tomato's, and a tangy italian dressing (i would order it on the side in the future) Very good and was more then enough for both of us.  Entree: She had a Margherita pizza which she added olives to. She ordered the small and it will last her two lunches in leftovers. I was a bit surprised to see the olives cost an extra $1.50 but other than that she loved it, and I enjoyed it as well. I had the home made Gnocchi, which were very good, and very filling. It comes with your choice of sauce, I ordered the four cheese sauce (how could you not) it was excellent, but if I had to do it again I would get a red sauce with it.  Please go there support them they are worth it. We have been searching for a pizza place in the downtown area, and I believe this is the champion!!!!
