Worst customer service in pharmacy. 5 people working and takes forever to be acknowledged. Then they argue with you over your coverage. I'd just go to Walgreens if my rx coverage would let me. You should too if you want to actually be helped.

Sierra has done my hair on numerous occasions, even after I moved away from Phoenix (now that's service!!). It's not easy to bleach out dark brown roots, then get the color on them to match the rest of an already neon red head, without having a band around the hair from bleach overlap. But with her skills, my hair looked flawless. No bands or lines. She's extremely talented and professional, but still really fun to spend all that hair processing time with. Not only did my hair look amazing whenever she did a color/cut, but somehow, my hair always felt healthier when she was done with it as well.  If you're looking for a stylist in the Phoenix area, I would definitely recommend you see Sierra @ Section. You can thank me later.
