Been coming here (almost daily) since I moved back from California in 2007. And finally decided to write a review. Great place! The food is excellent. Love their wings. And the beer is amazing. But what really sets this place apart is the fact that it truly is a place where "everybody knows your name". The servers do an excellent job of getting to know their customers (especially January - who really likes coffee, by the way). Have made some good friends here over the years.  Excellent staff + Great food + Great beer + Good people +  Only thing that would make this place better is cushy patio chairs and bikinis.

Man.. this place used to be so good. Not just this location, but any Native New Yorker. It is a fact that when a restaurant starts adding pictures to the menu, it's downhill..  Service was mediocre. But that's not even the reason I was prompted to write this review.  I usually stick with beer, but this time I decided to go for the Blackberry Mojito. I should have known something was amiss when I asked the server if they muddled the mint or not and she looked at me like a deer in headlights.  It got worse.  She came back and dropped it off at the table and immediately I knew something was off.. A taste... and then another... and then, "what in the *** is that?"  BASIL?!?!?!?!  Yeah... turns out, the bartender was out of mint and decided I wouldn't notice if he used basil instead.  Fool me once...

I drove by this place many, many times before I finally tried it. Don't let the outside fool you as it did me.  It's better than sex!  I've tried several things on the menu and I haven't found a single thing I didn't enjoy. The street tacos are my favorite, with a little of that homemade bbq sauce, and I can never decide between the regular or the habanero, so I alternate back and forth. Excellent beer selection, friendly staff, and a nice decor inside.  The only thing this place is missing is a smoker's patio, but even that isn't enough for them to lose a star.
