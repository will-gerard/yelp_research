We had deep dish apple pie and milkshakes. Both were very good.  Staff was friendly, and accommodating.

The food was AMAZING and the service was fast.  But the people here were the best part. They were friendly, considerate and made us feel welcome the whole time.

I've been with Alta Vista for several years, but in the past year I've had so many bad experiences, I've decided to find a new vet for my puppies.   In the past 6 or 7 months I've experienced poor customer service from their evening staff.  Last time I was in, I had an appointment for 6:00pm, but was made to wait for over 90 minites.  I left without seeing the vet and had to visit the emergency vet which cost a lot of money.   They have also had a problem accepting my vaccine records for my dogs because I give the vaccines myself.  I am a former vet tech so I know the procedure and I keep good records of their shots. Still, Alta Vista staff insists my dogs are unvaccinated and last time they were in, my dogs were treated like they were diseased pariahs.  Tired of this.

Dr. Holmes and his team were incredibly kind and helpful when my puppy got sick. They did a great job getting her better and didn't try to coerce me into expensive, unnecessary procedures. Dr. Holmes worked through the problem thoughtfully and was able to provide excellent care without costing a fortune.

Sadly, I found their beer mac to be disgusting. I forced myself to eat it because I am a gentleman. But now that the internet provides me a veil of anonymity, I feel compelled to warn others that this meal contains enough salt to jerky a beluga whale. It is apparently made from the concentrated tears of tea party bigots as they cry over legalized gay marriage. Which is odd as I normally find the tears of bigots to be refreshing. As they say, you can have too much of a good thing.   I now have hypertension.

Everything we tried was AMAZING. The Notorious BIG is possibly the best burger I've ever had. Creative and delicious drink, too.
