From the hostess to the serving staff, poor experience for a return guest. We had a 7:45 reservation and weren't seated until 8:20. Prior to being seated, we arrived at 6:45 in an attempt to catch happy hour at the bar, yet stood around for 10 minutes before being greeted at the bar. We ended up grabbing happy hour elsewhere.   None the less, while the experience can be fun, this establishment can use a lesson in service.

The manager was very attentive and most of all welcomed us as we were visiting for the first time experiencing a special occasion.   The Monday $50 special is amazing and not only is it a great deal, but they understand that because of the deal, they will attract new guests and work hard to make them return guests.   Love this spot and can't wait to go back!

From the Diego Margarita to the green chili tacos I love this place! Great vibe on the patio especially during happy hour.   Such a great vibe and cool spot. Love that they turned what was an awkward building, into such a chill and miami-esque environment!!!!
