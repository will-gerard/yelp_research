Hello, let me introduce you to a classy little theater in downtown Phoenix.   +Easy to find. You can snag free parking on the street, if you're lucky (assuming this show is after 5 p.m. on a weekday).   +Not a bad seat in the house.   +Super nice staff and seating attendants.   +Clean restrooms.  +Full schedule with plenty of shows.  - I felt like I was at a Nursing Home Annex. The audience may be a bit skewed toward the older generation, but it could have been the show I saw.   - Not alot to see or look at while you wait for intermission to end. (So make sure you go with somebody you can chat with!)  - There was cookies and cider at the bar, but I had no idea if I had to pay or not. (And, let's face it, I would have looked like a tool going up there to ask. El cheapo!)  Kym S graciously invited me to see Enchanted April here. And the play was marvelous! So kudos goes to Herberger for hosting such a delightful play. I would most definitely recommend this place, so check their schedule for upcoming shows.   And thanks Kym for the invite! I had such a great time!

Imagine this: over the course of 3 hours, you've imbibed about 6 Hobgoblins at The Lost Leaf. Your comrad - playing it safe, since driving - watched you down this UK tasty treat, while enjoying her own. Then you both decide to wander the block. That's when you make a stop at Fate. It being around midnight, the interior is decorated with only a few patrons, mostly at the bar. You two snatch a table inside, near the door, and begin to partake of the tempting apps - egg rolls, dumplings. One has another beer - part of the "sober up" process, he assures you. The Sober One munches contently, admiring the art on the walls, the low lighting, the discovery of a place for "after the bar," when she gets the munchies and the night is winding down, near ready for her lovely face to meet her pillow.   So, next time you're in the area, make sure to go to Fate. They offer a good array of menu items, which makes this place a great spot to go before the bar(s), or after.   They could invest in a better beer selection, but since they offered Kronenberg 1664, who am I to complain? (The Drunk One didn't.) Besides, I s'pose if you're looking for selection, you'll make the one-block trek to The Lost Leaf.

Out of all the wine bars I've been to in the Phoenix area (not counting Divine Wine in Mesa), this is my favorite! Hands down. The people are friendly, the room is spacious, the wine selection is supple & the atmosphere is cozy.   The last time I went was after dinner at Panino on Central. My date and I went into the wine bar to sample a selection. He chose his with cheese. I did not. My wine was incredible. We were able to relax on the couch, continue our conversation while having amazing wine at our fingertips. I was giddy with pleasure.   To top it off, the bathroom is unisex... and sneaky. Behind a wall without a handle, you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way. While waiting for an open room (there are two private bathrooms once you're inside), a couple men profusely apologized. Evidently, they thought they were in the wrong bathroom. Little did they know.   I would go back here in a heartbeat. In fact, I've been thinking of going soon - it's a perfect place for a date, since there's plenty of room to sit and an atmosphere conducive to conversation.   Forget Kaz. Try Cheuvoront instead.

Meh.  Can't believe I'm going to say this... but...  So, forget Cheuvront. Just go to Kazmirez.  Atleast at Kaz, you get ample variety when you order the fruit/cheese tray. At Cheuvront, you get a minute amount of cheese (only two types) with hardly any fruit or nuts. Forget it. Not worth it. Not after having Kazmirez fruit/cheese tray. Nothing else can compare.   I tried a Viogner by the glass, and it was the worst Viogner I've ever had. Also good to know: their bottle service is pricey. You can guy a $17 bottle of wine there and take it to go (good deal) or pay $35 for the same bottle to drink it at the restaurant. Uhmm... wow.   I feel for my date. He bought a glass of wine, 1 bottle of wine and 1 small cheese/fruit tray and it come to around $100. That, my friends, is the definition of absurdity.

Love this place!  I came here at 1 p.m. for lunch. I figured if I leaned on the late side to eat, I'd find a parking spot. Sure enough. Word to the wise: Late lunch here = good idea, indeed.   I entered through the back, where the outside patio is, and walked right up to the counter to order. On the wall hung a big blackboard. I read it, half-confused, expecting more than just one wrap offered. I panicked for a half-second, since I was hungry for the Who's the Turkey, thanks to Sarah G's review.   The friendly guy behind the counter must have read my expression. He handed me a freshly printed menu. Brand new, he said; they debuted yesterday. Ah-ha. "I've never been here," I admitted shyly. I looked back up at the board on the wall. "Ah, that must be the special..." I said half to myself and half to him. "If only I could read vertical." He laughed. On the board in chalk was this word:  S P E C I A L  I ordered the Who's the Turkey, without onions, with a side of fruit. For there. All for $7.50. Nice. I grabbed the Styrofoam cup handed to me and walked over to their "drink station" to get water and ice. I then took a seat near the counter. Plenty of spots to chose from. The place was half-full. Very cool. I picked up a couple free mags to peruse: Java and Urban Affair. Right on. Then I noticed them: stacks and stacks of Styrofoam cups. Weird. I figured a place like this wouldn't want to harm the environment. They even have a recycle-only bin near the trash. I was perplexed... and disappointed. I hate Styrofoam. For that alone, this place gets docked a single star. (I don't want to feel like I'm harming Mother Earth if I stop to eat here. I may bring in my own bottled water next time.)  My food arrived after a short wait. Beautiful. The fresh fruit came in a mini-cup (made of Styrofoam, of course) and was filled with red grapes, orange slices, pineapple wedges, strawberries and the best cantaloupe I think I've ever had.   The wrap was divine, too. I nibbled happily in my chair, so thrilled that I took a break from the office to get lunch here. I had almost changed my mind, but I'm SO glad I didn't. If I lived nearby or worked closer, I'd come here often. Like 3x a week often. I'd coerce friends and co-workers to come with me. It'd be a That's a Wrap Rally, indeed.   Nix the Styrofoam, won'tcha? Everything else gets an A+ from me.

Perfect winter or spring afternoon excursion. That is, if you have a sense of humor. Sure, looking at Man from the Andes and Agave cacti all afternoon isn't the most thrilling, but if you skew your perception, you can see just how comical these things really are. It's informative, too, if that's what you're after.  I've been twice. Both times with out-of-state friends. We walked every trail, took pics and found something funny about Puma Huts and rotting, crawling, oddly bent cacti. Or bird calls. C'mon, didn't you too?   The second time I went during the butterfly exhibit. It's a favorite now and I highly suggest you check it out the next time it appears. There's nothing so oddly extraordinary as watching a pretty insect come and land on your arm. And sit there. And sit there. And sit there. You look at it; it looks at you. And then, for some reason, you feel like the first kid picked during dodge ball. Seriously.   Oh, and a side note: the bathrooms are pretty clean. Bonus!  Odd enough, my favorite aspect of the DBG is this particular tree. It's near one of the "bridges" on the pathway. It's barkless, bright green, smooth and gorgeous.

I don't belong here, that's a given. Immediately when I walk in, I feel like there's a bright, shinning light over my head, as if I'm on stage and it's otherwise pitch black. Translation: I don't belong here.   I walk the aisles, admire the plethora of things I've never been seen or heard of. I look at the frozen fish and wonder how in the world to prepare such things. I look at the sake aisle and wish I knew which to pick, which one wouldn't soil my taste buds. Sometimes I'm tempted to pick up their fresh slices of sashimi, but I usually pass. I just can't talk myself into it.   I walk by the fresh fish, past the butchers and men with their imploring eyes. I feel uncomfortable under their gaze. I can only imagine what they're thinking. That's when I pretend even harder - pretend that I know what I'm doing, instead of wandering the aisles looking at anything from poxy stix to soy sauce.   Then I end up in the meat section, dumbstruck. Gizzards. Tongue. Heart. It's like a lab here, animals dissected to entertain my morbid fascination. I tend to get repulsed when I get to the chicken feet.   So, I pass through the produce aisle and stutter near the bakery. Here is where I once picked up the most delicious bread I've ever had. It certainly wasn't healthy, but I don't care. I've since gone back looking for another loaf, but have yet to find it fresh on display. I keep hoping, though, that someday we will be re-united -- myself and that delectable bread - otherwise known as "crack in a bag."    So, if I'm so uncomfortable, why do I even bother? Because I like trying new things, from teas to bread to meat. I just can't seem to pick up the latter, for fear of self-poisoning. Plus, nothing beats cheap bags of edamame here. Other stores want nearly $4 for a bag. Screw that.   I've also tried their milk pearl tea here. It's not bad. It's not something I'd get very often, for I can find better concoctions elsewhere. But, for what it's worth, it's not a bad choice if you're in need of quenching your thirst while you peruse the many aisles of Asian wonderments.

Dodgy. Sketchy. Shady. Skeevy. Whatever you call it, it's all the same and it's at the Breakroom.   Rodeo was on TV. Awful tone-deaf people were singing. I'm sure many a deal was happenin' too. Here's one place you're sure to score.   But, c'mon, it's not THAT scary. Granted, I ain't going by myself. But in a group or with a friend, this place is fine. They serve drinks just like anywhere else.   Only thing unique and vastly different about the Breakroom is that their patrons are bonafide true-blue people probably dealin' with real-life issues - not broken nails, bikini waxes or studly tans. Their stories are written all over their faces, and let me tell ya, after reading a chapter, I wanted nothing more than to put the book down and walk away.

Disclaimer: This review is based upon one and only experience with the venue...   Scene: April 2007. Reason: The Shins  INCREDIBLE.  This venue offers an intimacy that most don't, including places like the Marquee, Clubhouse and Rhythm Room. Which, if you think about it, is ironic since at Celebrity, you get to call dibs on some pretty amazing seats. Don't expect to be able to see the band, though, if you decide to sit. The entire crowd stood the entire time The Shins played. (Word to the wise: wear comfy shoes!)  My only beef with Celebrity is that they don't bring enough acts to Phoenix that would have me doing 15 cartwheels in excitement. But, when they do bring in somebody, like The Shins, it's worth every penny and every second of my time!

No matter how hard I try, I find it hard to like most zoos, including the one in Phoenix. I s'pose seeing animals in cages bothers me. Yes, that must be it. Also, smelling their fecal matter and wondering if the animals are embarrassed that they can't take a dump 1,500 ft away from their watering hole or sleeping spot. I would be embarrassed. Humans don't put toilets in the kitchen, after all.   Sure, I love being able to see live and in -person jaguars, snakes, apes, elephants, etc. But I always leave feeling sad, like the animals can't possibly be happy and content being locked up. They must know they're restricted. Sure, you build a cheetah a cage and think he's happy running the same path 1,349 times a day. But, let's face it, he's not. Don't tell me you haven't noticed.   And while I love that I've seen live pandas (in DC) or dolphins (in OKC), I just hate seeing animals in captivity. I wouldn't want to be caged. Who knows, one of these days, it could be the flying squirrel and her family, along with donkeys and dung beetles, who pay a minimal fee to come see human beings in cages and behind glass. "Oh, look," the baby flying squirrel will say, "that one there is flinging his poo! How gross!"

UPDATE (11/26/07): If you're craving a home-made pizza, you can buy pizza dough at this particular location. It's from their little corner "Italian bistro" where they actually make pizzas. Imagine that. They have a simple menu too, and you can call in your order. That's cool. What's even cooler, though, is buying the dough and make your own special pizza, which I did. The crust turned out great!  * * *  Here is where I'll find my new favorite bread, AJ's brand. It's multi-grain, only 70 calories a slice with 6 grams of protein in each delicious cut. I couldn't ask for more.   But, since I sometimes go shopping for more than bread, I know you can find pretty much anything at this AJ's, especially when making unique and exciting dinner entrees. From cheeses to nuts to produce and wine, you'll find what you need here. If you have any trouble, just ask. The people working here are really quite friendly. I actually enjoy going to a grocery store - GASP - so I can tell you that this place far outshines other retailers. Of course, it far outprices them, too. But, if it's a special affair or you just don't care, then this AJ's is for you.   I love how it's in walking distance too, situated in an easy-access plaza that offers other interesting treats, too, like Booster Juice and Sweet Tomatoes.   Oh, did I mention this place has a great beer selection? You can buy the 6-pack, sure, but for those nights when you're uncertain of what you're craving, you have the option of buying a single beer - mix and match, if you will - and not choking on the cost. Single beers here are cheaper than what you'll find at the bar. Granted, although it comes chilled, you can't open it on the spot. Wouldn't it be great if you could? (Beer tasting, anyone?!)  If you're not fond of beer (my god, what's the matter with you?), then peruse the liquor or wine selection. You can even find Mexican tequila that isn't your typical Jose. As for wine, I have always loved AJ's selection. Now I love them even more after discovering my new favorite Italian meritage. Cheers!

4240. Easy address to find. Plenty of parking in the rear. Street-facing patio for those who want to poke their heads outside, or for those who need their nic fix.   No noticeable "Entrance," though the "Exit" Is marked (I guess that's the more important sign to have up, anyway, in case the party inside gets too fun.)  (NOTE: "Main Entrance" is on the south side of the building. Once you walk in, the bathrooms are on your left - pool tables on your right. So much safer than walking into a game of darts!)  We walked in through the Exit... and just about took a dart to the temple. Quick, duck!   There were patrons playing darts, chattin' at tables, standing at the bar... It was filled without being packed. Open seats at the bar beckoned to us, so who were we to ignore the call? I took my seat and ordered a Guinness. Service was fast and attentive. My 2nd round came right as I finished my first.   This place is cool, although on the night I went (my first night, for the record) I noticed there was plenty of men, but only a few females. This bodes well if you're looking to get hit on, I thought... Of course, what happens when I just want to chill out with a drink? Guess we'll see next time.   In any case, with my friend in tow and conversation free flowing, I had a great time. Bonus - this place is within stumbling distance from my new abode. Nice!   So, naturally, the night I'm saddled up to the bar and enjoying my Irish beer and the happy buzz that it gives me, I notice something peculiar. Never mind the mix of people -- from artistic smarts to tat canvases to baseball fans. Instead, I noticed the female bartenders cleaning up the bar with aggressive impatience... almost like slapping their rags on the bar top was the clear call to clear out. What time was it? I checked my phone. 12:18, precisely. Even bars in Oklahoma stay open later than that. I looked at my comrade in puzzlement. What gives?   I guess we were being told that closing was coming soon, and our patronage with on a deadline. Well then. I savored the last gulps of my Guinness and we left... long before last call, I'm certain of it. But I didn't want to stick around to find out.   4 stars - based on a first experience. I say that's pretty damn good. I'll definitely be back. (NOTE: I went back...the next night! And I had just as great - if not a better - time at G&D. Bonus! I heard real British accents!)

What a cool little pub! H.B. Hanratty's offers nearly something for everyone, from video games and darts to pool and casual convos tucked inside one of their wooden benches. Open yet cozy, this bar has the ideal mixture of ample lighting with dark wood furniture and ceiling to create what some may call "your neighborhood dive bar." There's nothing really dingy about this place. It's not unsafe or anything, yet I like how you feel a bit off the beaten path when you come here. There's a few places to park along the East side or in the back. Plus, the place is really a cinch to find since it's right off the Southside of the street with a sign announcing you've found your watering hole.   Said to be an Ohio State bar, you don't really see much sporting merchandise here - a good thing, if you ask me. I'm told the beer selection is good, although when I tried to order something seasonal, they didn't have anything. Bummer. Instead, I went with the tried-and-true Sam Adams, followed by a Stella Artois. Both were served in a bottle, although the bartender tried to pour my Sam Adams into a glass. I had to stop him. "Just the bottle," I said. "That's enough for me." If memory serves me, each beer cost me $4. My companions opted for draft pints of Coors and Michelob Ultra. So, if domestics are your thing, H.B.'s has your vice in abundance.   I can definitely see myself hanging here, playing some pool or throwing some darts. Overall, the music was decent. I think they went from Rehab to Richard Cheese. Not quite sure how that happened, but it was interesting nonetheless.   Bartender was friendly, albeit a bit "snottish" when I asked to see a beer menu. He had none. Instead, he asked, "What are you looking for and I'll tell you if we have it." I would have much preferred a few choices rattled off to me since I couldn't really see the dusty bottles aligned on the shelf, nor did I intend to lean over the bar to take inventory. I must admit, I was a little put off by that. I guess he wasn't used to a patron wanting something other than "swamp water" (Bud or Coors).   In any case, I like this place. I'd definitely go back.  Word to wise: This is a CASH ONLY bar, although I'm told they have an ATM inside (although I didn't see it or go hunting for it, either). I guess somebody hasn't yet heard of merchant services...

2.5 stars. Borderline 3. I just wasn't impressed. Oh, but I wanted to be. I mean, a local brewhouse right down the street from where I live? I thought for sure this would become my home away from home. Instead, it was so mediocre and underwhelming, I can't help but wonder, "Will I ever be back?" Probably not.   My friend and I walked into the restaurant side of Sonora. I wanted to sit in the Den, where the brews are crafted. We were told to cross over the patio to the place next door. Alright. So, we did. Hardly anyone was there. In fact, the place didn't really pick up until the time we were leaving. Must've been the football game that drew people in, for there was a flat screen plasma TV behind the bar.   Speaking of bar, I was excited to try their Vanilla Porter. I was told it was so good, it would make you wanna slap yo' mama. "My mama needs a good slappin'," I thought. Well, she didn't get it. Ok, so maybe vanilla + beer isn't my thing, but I wanted to try something new, something special to this brewhouse. After all, isn't that the point? The kick and finish of this beer did not impress me. In fact, I struggled a bit to finish  my pint, which, was $2.75 during happy hour. At the very least, the prices to whet my whistle were great!   My friend and I opted to try the food. I felt brave and ordered the bratwurst. Maybe I'm not a bratwurst person, for it was just okay. Nothing else on the menu appealed to me, even though they do tend to have a variety (fish and chips to grilled salmon to soup and burgers).   The layout of the place was somewhat unusual. I mean, two seating areas connected by an outdoor patio area (with heaters). That was cool, except that when my friend and I left the Den, we had to cross the patio to get to the exit (in the other building). Along the way, I got one giant whiff of cigarette smoke. Yep, that's just what I wanted to top off what had become a very bland and unenthusiastic experience.

No. That's all I can say. The Ramen left something to be desired - I'd prefer Phu any day. The atmosphere was cool - bright red phone booth inside to pique your curiosity. The variety of bread they serve is a welcome change. My dining companion enjoyed the rare (and new) "yogurt beer."   I would go back to try another entree, but I would stay away from the Ramen.

Still Dark. Still Swank. Still Small.   MY RECENT EXPERIENCE:  Rhythm Room is a great place to catch live music. Don't let the location fool you. This venue brings in a wide mix of acts, including Rogue Wave, which I happily saw here last night. What a great show!   The parking lot was cramped, but we managed to find a spot (luckily). I don't recommend coming in the middle, between the opener and the headliner, unless you have good luck, which we did.   1. We found one of the last parking spots. 2. We easily got in, though the placed seemed packed to capacity. 3. We found a great place to stand, with a full view of the stage. 4. Two seats opened up for us, so we got to sit down for most of the show!   I was disappointed to see RR no longer carries Alaskan Amber - not even on tap, which they once did. They do now offer Kiltlifter and 8th St. Ale on tap, though, which is cool. There's also 2 Hefs to pick from, along with Guinness, of course.   But, let me be frank: The Guinness I ordered didn't taste like Guinness, not even the most flat tap Guinness I've had. My friend concurred that her Blue Moon didn't taste like the Hef she loves. Bummer. For $9.50 for two plastic cups, we decided one beer apiece was enough.  That's another thing... Plastic cups? Why not recycle? Geez.   RR is also a great place to learn about future shows - there and around town. Fliers are posted up all over the front entryway and there's a table near the door just covered in announcements. Plus, here you'll find your staple local rags - New Times, Get Out and Java.   RR definitely deserves 4 stars. They could still work to improve their acoustics and the stability of the stage. Poor Rogue Wave. They joked that they just experienced a small earthquake. "Did you feel that? The stage just moved!" (I got that on video!)   * * *  FIRST IMPRESSIONS:  Dark. Swank. Small.   This place is a treasure chest of fun. From beer on tap to mixed drinks, have your pick of the bar. Grab a table or saddle up to bar - just be sure you call dibs on your seat before the rush hits.   This place gets hoppin' during certain events. I've been here to see Chris Durante, Louisiana Red and Maritime -- all very unique acts. Each time I've gone, the place is happenin'. Don't worry about your hair, your jeans or your first impressions. Save that for Scottsdale. This is a place you go not to be seen but to hear true, genuine, blow-you-away music... all without paying a hefty price. Ticket prices range from $8 to $18. It's worth it.   So why not 5 stars? The acoustics. They could be so much better. No, it's not the noise and the volume that bothers me. It's the inability to hear the vocals when the band is jammin' out. So, for slower sets, I definitely recommend this place. However, you wouldn't want to see My Chemical Romance on stage at this venue. Of course, would you want to see those guys on stage at any venue? Ah, I digress...

Here is just one of the few places in the Valley you can find work from local, indie artists. But, don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself. In fact, do yourself a favor and pick up any book by Daniel Davis - After Halloween, Klawberry or Caught Creatures. There's nothing quite like finding a rare ruby among faux diamonds. And it's so cool to be able to support local artists!   Samurai Comics is a favorite comics store; one of the best anywhere, according to comic book enthusiasts (which I admit I am not). It has a friendly staff, nice owner and clean atmosphere. Problem is, though, that Samurai Comics, like many other stores, use the same corporate distributor - by force? Sadly, it makes the stock they carry nearly identical.  But, check out Samurai; it's one of the best.

4-stars for this simple reason: it's low key and unpretentious. Whether it's Tuesday or Saturday, there's room for you. It may not be at the bar, but there's room. I prefer this place on a weekday. Sit at the bar, watch the TV, drink the specials and chat with the bartenders. Or, play darts on modern-day dart machines. It's comical to play Cricket in space, or with balloons. If that doesn't fancy you, play it straight. Or meander to the pool tables and hit some balls around. Or, if you need some fresh air, step outside on the patio... Most often you'll see a red/blue flashing light show. Fun times.   It's not the easiest place to find if you don't know what you're looking for. I think the large strip mall across the street distracts you while you're driving. But, turn your gaze to the north side of the street and look closely for this hidden gem. Stopping in for a drink or two is definitely well worth it.

If you're looking to watch a movie, 4 stars. If you're looking to eat out, 4 stars. If you're looking for a sugary treat, 4 stars. If you're looking for a great glass of wine, 4 stars.   Pretty much, if you're looking to spend money, 4 stars.   This isn't your nightly hangout spot. It's not the public domain in which you people watch, although it gets pretty hoppin' during the weekend nights. From upscale restaurants to unique eateries, this place certainly gives you options. C'mon, it's the perfectly modern Date & Movie kind of center. But, I like it.   I'm not going to go every weekend, mind you. But once in a while is certainly a-okay. There's plenty of parking in the garage, or you can park across at the Biltmore and use the underground passage. It's a short trek, and everyone knows when the weather is nice, it's a rare treat to be able to walk more than 15 feet without hyperventilating, or sweating so badly you look like the creepy guy at the gym - you know, the one with the horrid pit stains.   In any case, this is a fun spot to go. It's a great date spot, I think. Case in point: Man waits with flower at Valet. Sleek black car deposits sleek woman in black attire. Man hands woman flower. She smiles. They walk toward Houston's. Uhm... I'm pretty certain that's a date. And it happened at the Esplanade. Right before my very own eyes. I swear.

Trendy, yes. Small, yes. Dark, yes. But I like this place. The doorman was friendly, as was the bartender. My friends and I found a place at the bar and watched the room fill up. It was a Friday night, too. The music was fantastic - electronica with just enough funk to keep your foot tapping. The wine was incredible. I tried the house Cab. I was highly impressed. I would definitely go back. I like the location. If friends were visiting out of town, I would recommend this place - it's great for those who like lounges, a variety of drinks and music that won't put you to sleep.

The smoothie could have been mixed a little bit better, unless you like sucking banana pieces up your straw.   Teenage girls behind the counter were perky. Although I was the only patron in the store at the time, they asked my name when I placed my order. Odd, I thought, but cool.   Very clean place with limited seating. Music was loud, though. Guess the teens were jammin' with Jamba.

I've always liked Trader Joe's, but hardly ever went, telling myself I couldn't possibly get everything I needed there. After all, each time I've been, I've gotten the impression it's like a half-market. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I still get that impression. Regardless, I went this past weekend because I wanted to look for my all-time favorite nut mix. Ironically, they didn't have the World Mix variety. I figured while I was there, I'd pick up some milk and look around. I began at the cheeses. I picked up a blend o fontino and asiago. Yum. Then I opted to try Trade Joe's chicken apple sausage. Of course, yams (or sweet potatoes) are a must. I also wandered the aisles, was tempted by a couple items but opted to spend $$ on wine and spirits, instead of garlic olive oil and coffee. Yeah, maybe my priorities are a bit skewed.  Anyway, I was disappointed with their beer selection. I wanted something for the holidays, for the "winter" I pretend is coming, to whet my whistle. I walked away empty-handed. Instead, I picked up 2 reasonably priced bottles of red wine - both intriguing blends. Why not, I thought.   Check out was easy. The cashier was super friendly. She double bagged. Good for her! I walked out feeling victorious, like I had gotten a really good deal. To prove my point, I compared price points between what I spent at Trader Joe's and what I spent at Fry's. Come to find out, everything was less expensive at TJ's. I swear it. Even their baby spinach salad didn't break $2. The skim milk, the yams, the chicken sausage... all less at TJ's. This tells me I need to shop here more often.   The only downside is the crowd. It's always cramped and I feel like I'm in every body's way. I damn sure know everybody is in my way. I don't like dodging people or obstacles. I don't like getting bumped into by carts and huge lady purses. There was even one point after picking up my spinach that I was trapped by two carts. The drivers were oblivious. I stood there, trying to figure out my best route of escape. Finally one lady looked up at me and moved her cart an inch out of the way. That's when I made a run for it.

One of the best lunches I've ever had was eaten at The Capital Grill. Sure, it might have been because it was free and I was able to order anything I wanted. Plus, we got complimentary apps and the dessert of our choice, but even then, the food was excellent. Trust me, "excellent" is not a word I throw around very often.   It was a business lunch, but I couldn't help but admire the wine list and imagine coming back here for dinner sometime. It would make a really great date place, especially if you splurged on the valet out front. After all, it is the Biltmore. And, let's face it, even I like getting dolled up every once in a while.   Back to lunch. I sampled the jumbo shrimp in the shrimp sauce, along with some really perfectly breaded calamari, which was the best calamari my lips have ever come across. I ordered the crab/lobster burger, which was presented as a seafood mix between a whole grain bun. Every bite was better than the last. I delightfully ate the entire thing.   Then, it was time for dessert. I chose the flour-less espresso cake. Unbelievable. It was so thick and rich, though, that I left half behind. Then again, who really needs to eat the entire piece? Granted, it was packed with so much sugar, I immediately began to droop into a mid-afternoon coma. But, I didn't care. I just had one of the best lunches of my entire life.   Sometimes I remember that lunch and I shake my head. Never mind it was for business. Never mind I didn't have any wine. Never mind I had to go back to work after wards. I still rate that lunch and this restaurant at 5 stars. Imagine how wonderful this could be if you order a glass of wine and go for a special occasion with a special someone. Wow. Talk about needing more stars for that!

I admit, it's trendy. It's popular. It's closer to Americanized sushi than traditional. But it's damn fantastic. If you need to please a group of picky sushi-lovers, go here. Try the Caterpillar, Tootsie and Spicy Tuna roll. They sound ordinary, but they taste spectacular here. Try a glass (or bottle) of Row Eleven Pinot Noir. Incredible. If you can, sit at the sushi bar and chit-chat with Harold. He's entertaining and he'll take good care of you.   Order the sashimi - yellow tail and eel especially.   I like the mood of this place, their ambiance and decor. I also dig that they have reverse happy hours for those who crave sushi at late night hours.   This is a must-try for fans of sushi. Forget Ra. Forget Stingray. Come here. It's more laid back and, more importantly, better sushi. I have been in search of a favorite sushi place for a year now, since I moved here. Zen 32 is the closest I've found to pleasing my own sushi freak.

First off, thanks to Jerad, back from sabbatical, for his animated service last night. Lesson learned? Don't ask questions, unless you really want to hear the answer. But, his enthusiasm was infectious and cute. Even better, he was a great server in the way he was friendly, attentive, respectful and charming. Nicely done. He had us laughing most of the evening, which was a welcome relief from the woes of Monday.  My friend and I hit this place up for their happy hour. I hadn't been in a while, so it was a no-brainer. Zen 32 is a sure-bet to me. I'm always going to find something on the menu I like, and I'm usually going to walk away very satisfied. It's not the most amazing sushi i've had, but it's predictable in the sense that it'll hit the spot every single time, no matter what I choose to try.  I ordered the salmon sashimi, veggie roll and yellow tail w/ scallion roll. They were very, very good. The yellowtail w/ scallion is a new fave. For sure. To wash it down, I had their Belgian White Ale. Tasty.   I gotta say, their happy hour prices are incredible. $3 per roll or sashimi order; $2 edamama; $1 off draft beer. I'm pleased to say I can come here and stuff my face without emptying my bank account. Plus, the HH menu is pretty diverse, too. From spicy to simple, you got options.   So, Zen 32, you're still a top favorite of mine. Anytime anyone suggests coming here, the answer is simple: yes! Their service, selection and sushi are tried-and-true. And that's all that matters to me. Mmmm.

The cup reads, "Arizona's Most Awarded Coffee House Since 1992."   My, what lofty praise, I think. Is this place really the best? Hmmm.   After forking over $2.75 for a double shot of espresso, I made my way to the coffee bar where there was cold skim milk, plenty of sugar packs and a variety of flavor-adds, like cocoa. Then, I took my first sip. Yum. Of course, can you really mess up a double shot of espresso? God, I hope not.   In any case, this place is "nifty." I use that word because it's situated next door to The Gelato Spot and is a bit crammed for space. A splattering of like 4 people at the tables near the door made this place look a bit too crowded to me. Then again, if I had been at one of those tables, I probably wouldn't have noticed, or even cared.   The girl behind the counter was very friendly. I appreciated that. It's not often I joke around with baristas. She managed to make me laugh, too. To me, that's sweeter than an extra pack of Splenda.   Hava Java is a great location. I wondered over here after stuffing my belly full of wonderful sushi at Zen 32. My cohorts were immediately pulled into The Gelato Spot while I ordered my beverage. 66% of 'em wound up with gelato. Having already ordered and flavored my double to taste, I went hunting for them. That's where I found 2 of them cozied up to gelato and another teasing herself with the idea. I sampled a couple, but was very content with my coffee. So, if you plan to drop by Hava Java, just make sure you walk right up to the counter and order, or you may be sucked next door where you'll succumb to your sweet tooth.   Then again, if gelato isn't your thing, I did see ridiciously huge muffins and bagels on display at Hava Java. They looked ridiciously delicious. I don't know why anyone would need a muffin the size of King Kong's fist. But, then again, I couldn't resist the after-lunch pick-me-up that Hava Java delivered.   By the way, did somebody say free wi-fi? Uhm, yeah. That makes it all the more worth it!

Tired of the loud and over-crowded bars and clubs? Tired of over-hearing the stupidest conversations known to man? Tired of people who give a rat's ass about their waist size and designer shoes?   Allow me to introduce you to Keegans.   So many spots around the Valley will be crowded, loud, filled with obnoxious people. When you feel like going out but not battling your way in the door or fighting for a table, consider Keegans.   Even on a Friday evening, there's plenty of room for you.   I can't vouch for their food, though the menu offers some pretty appealing sandwiches, burgers, salads and apps.   Best of all, I like the laid back atmosphere of their patio. Sure, it shares itself with a parking lot, basically, that grants you a view of busy Camelback Road or the hustle of Delux. But, while people are zipping in and out of traffic or waiting at least an hour for a seat, you relax without a care in the world. In a way, you're flippin' the finger to all those prissy pansies who think cramming into Delux for dinner is an ideal way to waste a night away.   Try the Sundog Amber Wheat. They have this chilled and ready for you. It's a damn fine wheat beer, if you ask me. (Definitely a new fave.)  When I'm in the mood to go out but to still be removed from the annoyances of people, I'll return to Keegans. It gets my seal of approval.   After all, what a novel concept: I can hear what my companion is saying!

4 stars.   Count 'em. Uno, dos, tres...quatro! Uhm, por que? I'll explain.   Before you hit the lanes, make damn sure you have somebody fun in tow. That's the make or break. If you bowl with a dud, you won't enjoy AMF Squaw Peak Lanes. Trust me. It all hinges on the company, for  the serious good times begin when the sun goes down (and trust me, even in Phoenix, it eventually goes down.)  Never mind germs. Grab a brew or three and claim your lane. Warm those fingers up. Crack those knuckles. And most importantly, stretch those hamstrings and calves, for bowling isn't just bowling anymore. The lights dim and the music rises. This is where it's at - Rock 'n Bowl!   Baby got back, indeed.   Upon leaving, one of my best friends and I got a round of applause. That's right. No, it wasn't because we were super studly bowlers (we weren't half bad, though). It was because we were super amazing dancers. I mean, it's Rock 'n Bowl. You Bowl. You Rock. Part of Rockin' is shaking your groove thing to whatever tune comes on. Yes, we are Equal Opportuney Dancers (get it?). Of course, what I love the best is singing about anacondas and baby don't wanna's, sugary sweetness and mutual silicone ickness...   Oh, and if you like throwing big, heavy balls and hearing the loud clank of pins hitting the ground, then you'll enjoy yourself, too.  "You two got something special," we were told on our way to turn in our sweaty shoes. "Aww, thanks!" I replied. He's right. I'm tellin' ya, it's all about the company!

My weakness, what is it? It's summed up in the name of this place, Borders Books Music and Cafe. Books are my weakness. Nothing is so erotic as the smell of a new book. Oh, wait. Music is my weakness. All kinds, even. And coffee? Well, I want some of that, too.   This Borders is an okay place. I ain't complaining. I even came her the week before Christmas to do some shopping (spur of the moment decision). The lines were long. The aisles, crowded. But, I had a new book to read. I had gifts. I was set for the holidays.   In the middle of January (on the 20th, to be exact), my car veered into the parking lot, opened its door and shoved me out, saying, "Go buy a new book, damnit." Who was I to protest? So, I did. I walked in gingerly, unsure if I should get another new book - at the rate I was reading, I would need a new one every week. Who really has an extra $68 lying around? Isn't that what libraries are for? Anyway, I succumbed and bought a book. Then I drove away, satisfied.   You see, Borders emails me coupons. And today, I updated my online profile so I can receive coupons from other companies, like Target and Priceline. Nothing like supporting the large conglomerates, right? Well, I like to think it's a small token of their appreciation, when, in fact, I know it's just a tease - save 10% on a purchase of 50$! Like, oh my god, that's totally worth it. (insert eye roll)    But, I can't complain. It's books, music and coffee - under one roof. Not to mention magazines, including Under the Radar and literary 'rags! And odds and ends that make perfect gifts, including what I picked up for my grandmother's retirement and my best bud's birthday.   As for my car, it wants to go to Borders again. I can just feel it. Maybe I'll be real nice and take it there today...

Hi, my name is Alicia and I have a migraine. In fact, I've had one for 7 straight days. My wonderful doctor just wrote me two prescriptions so I can kick the pain in the pants. Groovy. Prescription Drop-Off = No problem. 15 minute wait? I can swing that. What's another tick, tick, tick of the clock as my head throb, throb, throbs.   I mosey around the aisles. Nice. Latex gloves on sale - 3 boxes for $10. Oh, look, espresso chocolate.   Tick, tick, tick.   45 minutes later without my name called over the loudspeaker (bummer), I head to the Pick-Up. I'm anxious for my meds. It's been a long day anyway, and this is the final stop. Or so I thought.   I take a seat and stare at the floor. After all, the overhead lights hurt my eyes. I glance up and the pharmacist smiles at me. That's pleasant. I continue to wait.  "What's the name?" I answer her.   That's when I hear they have 3/4 of my prescription ready but that one drug (my drug of choice to tackle the migraine) is out of stock. Would it be okay if I waited until Monday?   Uhmmm...   My mind flashes back to another Walgreens on another day when I'm waiting - in agony, mind you, after oral surgery. I want my narcotics like the children of rock wanted their MTV. I was told they were out, and I'd have to wait... or take my carcass to another pharmacy. I opted for the latter, for the claw marks in my palms were evidence enough that I couldn't stomach this pain any longer.   So, needless to say, when I was told by this particular Walgreens that they were out of my gonna-make-your-boo boo-all-better meds, I had an emotional hiccup. WHAT?   Count up the minutes. One hour in this stinkin' Walgreens and I'm really no better off than when my peds walked through the front door. Double ugh. Why couldn't they have called my name over the loudspeaker like they said they would? Then I wouldn't have waited in vain.   Stupid pharmacy. I want my drugs!

This place is getting seriously demoted.   For the second time, I have been turned away from my absolute fave cardio class because it has filled up to capacity 45 minutes before it starts. What? Really? Does this mean I have to speed up my after-work rush just to ensure I can write my name down on their sign-in sheet? That's bogus.   What a fiasco. The last time the class filled up, I went up to see for myself. So many regulars, who said they signed up, were without spots. That's when one went down to get the sign-in sheet and an employee. Good for her.   Total chaos. When I asked the front desk what I needed to reserve my spot, chick-a-boo behind the counter had no clue. Then the guy who pulled out a binder really wasn't any better. I wanted to know the process. Don't just tell me to sign-up and pay a $1. I want to know how the system works, man! I said, "Good to know for future reference," then I left. It's also good to know that you MUST reserve a spot IN PERSON so they can take your dollar. I don't trust them. They'd probably lose my information and I'd get screwed over, again.   I don't use the machines there because they're shitty. I go for the one or two cardio classes that I absolutely love - because of the instructors. Everything else creeps me out, even the female locker room.   Plus, the one time I asked the front counter staff about a personal trainer, she had NO IDEA their names. I tried to describe the one I saw upstairs working out with a client. He was doing moves I used to do, ones that really focus on stability and strength. I thought, "He looks like he knows his stuff, and I have free sessions here I still haven't used. Oh, why not?" Well, chick-a-boo had no clue. "Go look over there at the board. They have their photos up." That didn't help me, because I didn't really see the trainer on the board. Maybe he was new or he cut his hair. I don't know... How f'n annoying. It reminds me of when I first joined and asked for a trainer to give me a call. Nobody did. Suckas.  I hate this place. I hate going here, but I can't resist because of the cardio classes I love so much. ARRRRGH. It just sucks squirrel nuts that I have to show up AT LEAST an hour before class just to get a spot!

I don't really want to tell you 'bout this place. Should I? Maybe I shouldn't. After all, it's a gem. Maybe I should be selfish and keep it to myself.   Yeah, I really don't want to tell you how great this place is. I don't want to tell you that the bartender is one of the most friendly, funny and attentive guys I've seen behind the bar (why I can't remember his name right now, I don't know). I don't want to tell you that the drinks are served strong and fast. I don't want to tell you that there's live music to please your ears - and get your foot tappin'. Nor do I want to tell you that you can play darts or pool in a very, very casual and laid back atmosphere.   You see, I love going to Pat Murphy's. No pretensions. No fuss. Just real people - some more rough around the edges than others - enjoying "going out" as it should be enjoyed. Don't expect state-of-the-art dart machines or unscratched pool balls. This isn't your trendy bar. It's no dive, either. It's exactly what you want when you just want to chill out, have a few really well-made drinks and hang out with friends.  No, I don't want to tell you that this Irish Pub is quickly one of my favorites in the Valley. But, since you asked, I guess I have to.

"brick of a burrito" - that says it all.   When I first had Chipotle it was in Dallas, TX before The Pixies show. As you can imagine, the food was great, and I was thrilled at the concept of build-your-own-burrito. With that said, I don't like Chipotle. Or, perhaps, saying I'm not fond of it is more accurate. Who am I kidding, I can take it or leave it.   This location is a royal pain. Don't go - whatever you do - during lunch time during the week. That's just asking for trouble. Sure, you can call your order in ahead of time, but you still have to wait in line to pay for it and get it bagged to go. Not worth it.   Last time I ate 1/2 my brick burrito, it made my tummy hurt after wards for the rest of the day. Needless to say, I haven't been back.

Ok, I admit it: I love having my teeth cleaned. There's nothing like running the tip of your tongue over clean, smooth and fresh teeth. So, you can imagine my excitement when I decided to go in for my quarterly cleaning.   Having received a voucher in the mail, I figured 25$ off a service was enough of a draw to get me in. Granted, this voucher wasn't mine - it was for the previous occupant of my apartment. But, hell, the dental office didn't know that. "A friend gave it to me," I told them when I presented it proudly at 8 a.m. one morning. I was then told that's for birthdays only, and when my birthday comes around, I'll get mine to use. Oh. Well, I was already there, so I might as well stay - without the voucher even. Good thing my dental insurance covered the cleaning.   After 30 minutes of waiting, I'm escorted back to a regular, average-sized dental office. You know, all decked out with the typical dental chair and machinery. That's when I'm told that the X-rays I emailed weren't going to be enough, so they had to re-take 'em. WTF. Ugh.   First off, I hate stuff being stuck in my mouth. It pinches my cheeks and hurts. So, when the dental hygienist said, "You have a really small mouth," I wasn't surprised. It wasn't the first time I heard it. Nor was it the first time I had ever had X-rays taken. Hell, I got 8 beautiful veneers last year. You don't get those overnight. That's one helluva process, which includes way too many impressions (translation: gooey-ness and mouth pieces stuck in your mouth for at least a minute.)   So, I sucked it up. It had to be done. It was the means to an end, I told myself. Besides, my dental insurance should cover it.   That's when I was told they then had to measure my gums. An assistant was called in and the poking and counting began. I didn't mind, but it was more of my time devoted to routine practice... and not the cleaning I had been dreaming of. Oh, sweet cleaning, why were you playing hard to get?!?  Imagine my frustration when, after the Gum "stuff" and X-rays were taken (a few re-taken due to bad shots), I then had to have my mandatory consultation with the dentist. I guess he, himself, had to poke and prod around my gums and teeth. That's when he wanted to talk about replacing a couple caps and taking care of a cavity I have. Uhm, now? All I wanted was a cleaning. Seriously.   Plus, he heard that a friend referred me. "What friend?" He asked. "Uh, Christy." I lied. "Christy who? I only ask because I like to thank my patients when they refer their friends." I was cracking up inside. Of course he did. "I don't know," I said, "I don't really know her that well."  That's when I checked the time. It was close to 10 and I had a meeting. Was this really happening? I told them I had to get going because of work. Ok, so maybe I didn't look like the young professional I am when I'm sitting in a dentist chair with flip-flops, jeans and an old t-shirt on. Not to mention my hair was haphazard in a pony-tail and my face was free of make-up. Who was I trying to impress anyway?   Bottom line, I had to get going. The friendly hygienist (who, turns out, is from Michigan) said the cleaning would take about 20 minutes. I let my office know I was running behind; then, I relaxed into the dentist's chair.  Time for the cleaning!   Ah, the cleaning... bliss... pleasure... oh, sweet jesus...  Then, ugh. Fluoride. I was told I couldn't eat or drink or rinse for 2 hours. WTF. My stomach rumbled in anger.   Afterwards, I was given the usual bag of goodies. Upon check-out, the woman at the desk had already drafted up the coverage and cost for the procedures the dentist said I needed to get done. Cool. That's helpful, I thought. Right on. But then she wanted to schedule the appointment. "I need to check my schedule," I said. She looked surprised again, as if to say, "Oh, you work?" Yes, g'dammit, I work!  After telling her about 2-3 times that I would have to get back to her, she finally let me go.   That's when I sped out of the parking lot with 15 minutes to run home, change (no time for a shower, grr!) and get my arse to work. I hate-hate-hate running late. I didn't know that a routine cleaning scheduled at 8 a.m. would take 2 hours.   So, why the 4 stars? I can't knock how thorough this office is. I just wish they would have told me ahead of time, then, the working gal I am, I would not have scheduled an important meeting that morning. I would have saved it for the afternoon, esp. since I had to lead a meeting on an empty stomach with Fluoride breath. Meh.

Superb service. That's a big deal when it comes to your teeth.   I had to have a root canal, ugh. But the doc and his assistant made it as painless as a root canal can be. Plus, they call ahead of time to remind me of my appointments. They also called after wards to make sure I was doing okay.   During the procedure, they'd check to see if I was hanging in there. The assistant was also kind enough to tell me what they were doing. Whenever I asked prior to my appointment on how long each visit would take, they would give me a fair estimation. I really appreciate that - so I can plan accordingly.   Another big thing is the wait time. Talk about nada. When you're appointment is at 3 p.m., you can be certain you'll be taken care of on time. Right on. Nobody likes to wait, especially when it comes to the dentist.

Maria is the shiznit. Thank goodness she came highly recommended. I was in dire need of a rockin' stylist in my 'hood. This is a mom and pop kind of place that's been around over 20 years - same location, south side of the street, just behind CoCo's. The people here are super friendly, and they carry all kinds of high-end brands, including Matrix and Aquage.   The interior is a tad dated, with an old TV in the waiting area. When I was there, they had the Diamondbacks game on. Right on. On the tables are plenty of hair magazines to peruse. You won't find trendy furniture here, but, let's face it, are you making an appointment because of a chair or because of a great haircut?  Back to Maria...  She's incredibly friendly and professional. She's the first stylist EVER to tell me about the texture of my hair, how to complement my face shape, my hair growth pattern, my primary and secondary color hues - as well as explain the many different cutting techniques she used and why (to build volume, to make ends piecey, to shape my face, etc.).   I was totally impressed!  She gave me styling tips, too, and explained cowlicks and what to do about them. She then went on to talk about styling products and what's best for my hair type - including what conditioners to use and how often. Yeah, talk about impressed... We chatted also about travel - Boston, Chicago, Seattle - and living in Phoenix. She is super nice and easy to talk to, which is a huge plus in my book!  Even better, one week after my cut and I'm still impressed. Stylin' it is super easy. I can blow-dry and go, or I can opt to funk it up with a flat iron. Her stylin' tips are helpful, too. And I'm so glad she used alot of texture and fine-point cutting, for it created a look I haven't been able to have since moving here. Seems not alot of stylists really understand their clients' hair types.   I definitely recommend Maria to anyone, especially if you're looking for a 'do you know will flatter your face shape, your personality and your hair type.

Finally, I can Yelp about an apartment complex. Now that I no longer live here, I feel compelled to Yelp about the Mandarina.   First off, I hate leases. I hate apartment complexes. I hate paying deposits and being treated as if I'll do damage before I ever move in. I'm no messy criminal. Good thing for me, the Mandarina staff treated me as if I were the mature, responsible and nice adult I am (for the most part).   Of course, you think, "They have to do that while they're trying to get you to sign." Well, even after I signed a lease and moved in, the staff were helpful, considerate and friendly. I can honestly say that. And believe you me, I've had my run in's elsewhere with some pretty crabby management.   Each month when it was time to pay rent, the staff made me a copy of my check and signed and dated it. Ah-ha. Proof, I thought. I never needed it, nor did I need to worry about getting my security and pet deposit back. After I moved out and cleaned my place, I did one final walk-through with the staff. I knew that day whether or not I'd be charged for anything. I wasn't, and my happy refund found its way to me in a matter of days.   So, how was living there? Were there any problems? Of course there were. It is, after all, an apartment complex. You can't really choose your neighbors, although for a time, I lived next to some really cool guys who played football. I was sad to see 'em leave.   Guest parking is a joke. Most of the parking is covered and reserved for residents, so any guest that comes over must come early enough to find a spot, or be okay with hoofing it from somewhere else. I guess you could always park in the Castle Boutique across the street.   Let's talk gym/pool. I used both on a regular basis, especially the gym. It was always clean with fresh towels and cold water. The cardio machines aren't anything to brag about, but I sure did love having free weights at my disposable, along with a couple weight benches and leg presses. Plus, here's where you'll find a vending machine if you need your soda fix. As for the pool, I wouldn't say it's the cleanest since it's publicly shared. I didn' t see many people using it during the week, so I took advantage of after-work swims. You can have open containers, too, which is nice if you want to relax with a brew. Just don't ignore the pool rules. No glass allowed. I found out that!   Inside, across from the gym, is what they call a Business Center. It has two computers with Internet access. You can check your email or Myspace 24/7 without too much of a wait. I wouldn't suggest saving your passwords or personal documents on the desktop, but I certainly ran across my fair share of interesting things... People who aren't moderately tech savvy should probably not use public computers. In any case, getting to the computers is easy. Sometimes you have to wait, for people bogart the machines. I guess it comes with the territory.   Here comes my gripe. Maintenance - both interior and exterior. I never once had my single call for maintenance answered. I un-clogged my own bathtub and said "to hell with it" regarding the broken ice machine. Whatever. I found you can't really rely on this place to fix things, unless they're absolutely necessary. As for the landscaping, it's okay. I don't understand why they water the grass and trees every night, creating a swampland. Makes no sense to me. Nor will I ever be a-okay with landscapers waking me up at 6:30 a.m. to trim hedges.   But, looking back over the 12 months I lived there, I have to say 98% positive things to say about Mandarina. They are a bit overpriced, but if you can afford it, it's a pretty good place to live, especially since you'll get your own Washer and Dryer in your unit.   The location is great if you don't mind being nestled around business parks and buildings. There's places to eat at Priest/Washington and 48th/Washington. You'll have easy access to the 202 and 143 also. The light rail runs right in front of the complex, so that can be a plus or minus, depending on how you look at it. At first, I was thrilled. Then I found out that the light rail won't stop at the Mandarina. So, I figured, why stick around when I can't play with the new city toy? That, and I refused to pay higher rent.

Everyone loves fun!   At F1 Race Factory, fun is their focus. Safety is their MO.   I came here in the fall of '06 for a work function. It was a team-building day, so while we did have to meet in a room and "talk shop," the people at F1 made it very comfortable and easy. We met in their big room (with couches, high tables and ample space) for our meetings. Breaks were then infused with team fun. We actually got to split into groups and challenge each other - see who could be the fastest team to change 4 tires on a real (thought retired) race car. My team placed 2nd. It was great! We got to do a practice run, and then two real runs to let our lowest time qualify.   F1 was sure to have snacks and beverages handy after (and before) in case we worked up an appetite during the day. Lunch was served here, too. Tasty hamburgers made to order. After our meetings, we got to go on the track. Beforehand, we sat through a brief safety video and explanation. Then we were fitted for helmets and shown to where the action happens. I was nervous. I had never driven a go-kart before, and these were suppose to be the fastest in-door go-karts in Arizona.   Uhm, yeah. Let's just say I had no idea what I was doing. Nobody explained the pedals to me, so I just assumed they ran like a car. I was right. I took off, not really knowing how many laps I had to do or where I was going. There were friendly guys out on the track to wave flags - for "wreck" ahead, slow down or even get out of the way of speed-devils behind ya. (I got the latter quite a bit.)   At the very last of the race, somebody sped by me to place ahead of me. That means I placed last. That's okay. It was my first time out there, and while I spun my car around once or twice - and ran into the sides several times - I was just happy to be alive!   To make the race fun, F1 gave us awards for 1st, 2nd and 3rd. I won an award, too - for being the turtle on the track. That was funny.   All in all, I had a great time. While I would probably not go to back to race, I'd go back to watch people race or hang out in the "cafeteria" area, playing arcade games or munching on food.   This is DEFINITIVELY  a fun place to send your thrill-seeking, speed junkie friends. You can get gift cards, too!

My Wine Cellar is the retail half of Lucy's Place, which is the "wine bar." Together, they offer you a bit of everything - from a plethora of wine to purchase and take home to a menu that sells by the glass. Pair their chardonnay or pinot noir with a bruschetta or caprese salad appetizer, and you'll find yourself in palette nirvana.   The place boasts a cozy, off-the-beaten-path feel. You walk in and are immediately transported to a more relaxed, come-as-you-are, drink-as-much-as-you-want atmosphere that offers dining tables, comfy chairs and couches and a short bar. Inside the colors are true to wine bar standards - on the dark side, encouraging to just let your tense shoulders relax. Lucy's place is a delightful find - a hard throw away from the trendy places you'll find in strip malls or in popular Scottsdale locations. In fact, it's nowhere near Scottsdale, nor does it pretend to be anything except what it is - a wine bar that offers you a wide selection, impeccable service and an atmosphere you aren't quick to leave.   When I went, they had live acoustic music - a one man show playing the likes of Ryan Adams and Wilco. It was the perfect addition to a satisfying happy hour experience.   Plus, Lucy has a couple small TVs hanging in view, in case you need to catch the baseball scores (it so happened to be turned onto the Red Sox game).   I didn't want to leave. That in and of itself tells me Lucy's Place is a rare find. I'd give it 5 stars if it were in my neighborhood. It's a short trek southward, but definitely worth a regular visit if you're in the area or just in the mood for wine that'll satiate your palette, along with a relaxed atmosphere that'll assuage your workday woes.  http://my-wine-cellar.com/lucys_place.htm

Now this place knows how to treat you. Sure, I may have been among several people with birthdays in January and February. Sure, it may have been a special occasion that the owner was aware of. Sure, I may have been sitting with a man with connections, who knew the owner personally. But, don't hold that against me. Luck of the draw, I tell ya.   I had heard great things about this place, yet had been surprised that I had never heard of this place - until it was time to have a group birthday dinner. What a way to celebrate!   Wine, appetizers, entrees, champagne, dessert... It's no wonder somebody didn't have to roll me out afterward. I sampled the calamari and prosciutto/melon apps. Both were very good, although the latter was a bit too salty for me. The bread in the bread basket was good - great way to curb the appetite before ordering - but nothing compared the the herb butter. HOLY CRAP! I don't think I've ever met a butter I fell instantly in love with - well, not until I dined at Tutti Santi, that is.   I ordered the special - orange roughy stuffed with eggplant, mushrooms and probably some kind of cheese. Regardless, it was very good. The creamy sauce was heavenly, too, and I really don't like cream sauces. It came with a side of pasta that was seasoned very well. You didn't need to dip it into anything. It was great as a stand-alone side to the special.   I wasn't the only one who enjoyed my entree. Everyone at the table seemed to gobble up their food. I was the last to finish. Maybe I'm a slow eater? I don't know.   Then came dessert - tiramisu, cannoli, cheesecake. My god! Plus, the owner celebrated our birthdays with a bottle of champagne. So good. Surprisingly, I wasn't overly stuffed to where I felt sick. I probably should have been, but after moving all day, I was sure hungry!   I definitely recommend Tutti Santi for a special occasion, whether it's with a loved one, a birthday party or a family event. You can't go wrong here. As for the atmosphere, it's warm, inviting, cozy - with dim lighting and the soft sway of conversation. If nothing else, there's sure alot of pictures and things on the wall to keep your attention - that is if you're not too busy stuffing your face.

Oh, yummy.   I know this is a chain, and while I typically avoid chain places like a cat avoids water, I actually really, really, really like this place. First time I went was with family. We helped ourselves to chips, salsa, calamari and the unique variety of bread they serve. All very satisfying.  Then I had the BBQ Burger. Oh my, heaven slapped between two buns. Bacon on top. Bliss. It was too massive for me to finish, so I took it home.   Then, dessert. Banana Foster pie, that's all I gotta say. Scrumptious. My dad had the bread pudding - meh.   My second trip here was with a friend - the afternoon before our 5K race. I helped myself to the Tuna Salad Sandwich (topped with avocado) with a requested 4 slices of bacon. Superb. It came served with fries.  Upon my request, a plate of fresh fruit come out before lunch. Melon. Oranges. Pineapple. Delicious!   And it won't break your bank. Between paying for myself, my friend and leaving a generous tip, the tally came to $30.   I will definitely be back. In fact, some days I find myself craving Mimi's. Maybe it's the "quaint" feel or the insanely expansive menu, but I just like this place.   The menu is so expansive, everyone in your dining party is sure to find something s/he likes - including beer.

Owie. My belly hurt after eating here.   I was looking forward to steamed veggies, but they didn't have any. Said they were out. Total bummer. So, I ate some shrimp spring rolls and sampled others. I steered clear of fried stuff, but it didn't seem to matter. My belly was upset almost immediately. Maybe it was the coconut bread. I couldn't help myself; it was super tasty!  After my friends had plucked something off the dessert cart, the server brought us some bok choy. I thought they were out, but I guess they had some hiding in the kitchen? Anyway, I ate that happily. It was the first time I ever tried bok choy. I'm a fan! Not of this place but of the super healthy veggie.   I think I'd rather go to YC's Mongolian Grill again before ever coming back here.

So not my scene.   From the heavy metal screaming in one room to the juke box that never plays your songs in the other, this place left something to desire. It's no wonder I call this place Crappy Don's.   To give them credit - and 2 stars - they had a couple good craft beers available, a dart board, pool table and beanbag game. It's not the worst bar I've ever had the misfortune of walking into yet it's not the best, by any stretch of the imagination.

3/11/08 UPDATE: Sakana is great for take-out, too. Generous portions of nigiri sushi are sure to delight just about anyone. While they may not offer alot of selection when it comes to rolls, what they do serve up is mighty tasty and sure to satiate even the most hungry of sushi lovers.   * * *  Forget that it's in a strip mall or lacks decor. Just go. Sakana is one of the best places in the Valley to enjoy sushi. They have unique rolls that'll pique your interest, and perhaps encourage an eye brow raise. If colorful rolls aren't your thing, then go with the sashima - the pieces are so generous, you'll feel like you robbed the place.

Best damn salad I've ever had in my life. Based on that alone, I give Houston's 4 stars. Perhaps someday I'll venture back to sample their dinner menu.

You can't spell Fun without an F. And in this case, the F stands for Farrelli's. Talk about a great way to spend an evening!   I ain't gonna lie. You can easily rack up a pretty lofty bill, especially when you're ordering wine by the glass and $9.50 appetizers that taste too good to be true. My fave has to be the Garlic Shrimp Pizza, though it was a tad too greasy. Also good: Baked Brie L' Orange and the Fruit/Cheese plate.   Farrelli's offers a large drink selection, including featured cocktails and seasonal beers. But, for the wine lover, you'll be happily pleased to see their expansive wine list. You can buy by the glass or the bottle. Prices start at 7 and go up to 9.50 for their suggested Earthquake Cab. I had a glass of that (very good), as well as the Round Hill Cab, which I preferred.   A movie will cost ya $8.50. But seriously, it's not the price that matters. It's the experience.   Picture this: You place a simple phone call into Farrelli's and tell them you want to make a reservation for (insert time here) for (this many people here). They put your name on the list, then advise you to arrive 30 minutes before showing so they can seat you and take your order. You are welcome to arrive even sooner and take a seat in their bar, which boasts pictures of Hollywood stars, including the timeless Marilyn Monroe.   The theater itself feels more like a larger lounge area, with a movie screen. You sit in comfortable leather chairs at a round table.   Best thing of all? You can simply push a button during the movie and your server will answer. What is it that you needed? No worries.   At the end of the movie, you get a bill, much like at a restaurant. You can split it up however you feel like it. My close friend said, "Don't be alarmed by the bill." Thanks for the warning, for between the three of us, it was $125 w/o tip. I guess every once in a while you just need to spoil yourself, right?   If you go with someone (or a few someones) and you all can agree on a wine to order, I suggest ordering a bottle. It's the one piece of advice I'd bestow on anyone going here. Also, no need to dress to the 9's. This place will welcome you in jeans and chucks!   Farrelli's is a great experience. I recommend it for everyone - friends, family, a date. The movies they offer here aren't new releases, but they manage. (Be forewarned: Their "advertisements" at the start of the film are hideous. We're talking center alignment with ugly font and sentences that never end... Oy vey.)  I will definitely be back!

As you approach this building from the outside, you don't really expect alot, or at least I didn't. It's in a strip plaza (across the street from the Fry's on 90th), surrounded by shops catering toward spyware and vitamins. Odd, huh? In any case, you walk in and immediately notice how small the place is. Some may call it quaint - perhaps that's a nicer way of saying "i could walk the length of the restaurant if I took 50 giant steps."   Sushi bar is where to go. The chefs are polite and offer suggestions. Don't expect to be entertained, but do expect to receive your order in a timely fashion.   You get a clean towel here, too. And prompt beverage service. 3.50 for a Sapporo - you can't go wrong.   So, is there anything extraordinary about this place? Not really, but perhaps that's why it works. Without the loud music and flashy scene of Scottsdale, you instead find succulent sashima in generous portions, along with a menu that makes you "hmmm" and "uhmmm" a bit longer than usual.   Miso soup is medicore (i've had better) and the edamame is refreshing without a thunderstorm of salt - thankfully!  Jazz Roll. Crazy Roll. Shrimp Tempura Roll. How do you decide? When it doubt, just try it all. Or get the Caterpillar Roll - it's made different from other places. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something oddly wonderful about mixing textures - from the softness of the rice and avacado to the crunchyness of the inside. Oh, and eel is divine. So is the extra bonus of shrimp ontop.   I wouldn't consider this my fave place, and it's definitely not in my neighborhood... but if you live, work or just happen to be in the area, definitely stop into Hiro. You shouldn't leave disappointed, unless you're expecting something other than great food, friendly staff and, lo and behold, a restaurant where you actually hear Japanese spoken by the staff. Now that's worth a bonus star!

Yelp says 2 stars means "Meh. I've experienced better." You would think that's all I'd have to say in my review, right? Well, I want to explain why I've had better. Deal? Deal.  *There was a rather long and slow line when I entered. Quickly, it became even longer, with 4-5 people waiting behind me. Only one lady at the counter was taking orders. Wow. On a Sunday afternoon?  *The place was packed. No open indoor seating. It's crazy to think of one person and a laptop taking up a large table with 4 chairs. Waste of space. (Our book club needed 5 seats!) *The smoking outside is unbearable.  *Only one size straw. Seriously? My small hazelnut latte looked like a freak of nature with a 15" straw jutting out of the lid.  *The aforementioned drink I bought was not that tasty. It was naturally too sweet. Go figure. I had to nurse it for fear of a sugar brain freeze.  *Kids everywhere. College, I mean. Not really my demo.   I love the idea of turning an old bank into a happenin' coffee joint. The decor is cool. I WOULD LOVE to hang here. But, I can't. It's just too packed and not very friendly (from the service to the seating options).   If I were in the 'hood and wanted a quick jolt, I MIGHT stop here. Or, as others have mentioned, I could just keep driving a short distance and stop at one of my fave spots ever, Steve's Espresso. Yeah, I think I would keep on driving. This place is, with 2 stars, simply meh. I've experienced better.

Cozy, eclectic, great people behind the counter. Oh, and the pastries look like heaven served warm (whatever that means). I like that they have variety of chai to try - from spiced to raspberry. I like the decor, the art, the "feels like home" warmth of the place. Seating inside is scarce, so plan accordingly. There's outside tables, too.

Excellent food. Topped only by the service, which is the friendliest you'll find in Phoenix.   I had the 1/2 sammie and soup. I chose their 3-cheese grilled cheese, which was great, along with their chicken tortilla soup. It cost me $3.10.  I had a huge (generous portion) of 2% milk for $1.75 and a cup of coffee, which I heard was some pretty great coffee. I liked it, yes, but I wouldn't rave that it was the best ever.   My colleagues loved this place. They said they can't wait to come back. Good!   I was able to talk to the owner about Yelp and how we all heard of this place. I'm glad I was able to do a lunch search in the area of Eba Cafe. This place is the perfect lunch spot, followed by a quick drive over for boba tea afterwards.   They serve breakfast all day. The prices are reasonable. And, like I said, it's super friendly. So, what are you waiting for? Go!

Art. Everywhere. Even in the architecture. That's what I like about the Phoenix Art Museum. From fashion to photography to sculpture and the revolving door of special exhibits, this museum has an appeal. Sure, you may not encounter the rarest of paintings, but you can come face-to-face with a Monet, O'Keeffe or Warhol. You can step nose-to-nose with an Ansel Adams photograph. You can get inches away from a slurp and slap of oil onto canvas, then slowly back away until the entire image comes into view. To me, that's the beauty of it, along with your own interpretation. Some pieces draw you in while others are, to you, more boring than spilled soy sauce (sart = soy as art).   General Admission is $10. If you have a KAET Passport, you can get a two-for-one. Even better, it costs nothing on Tuesday evenings... AND they are now open FREE for First Fridays, from 6 to 10 p.m. So, there's no excuses to not check out the Phoenix Art Museum on a semi-regular basis. Or, if you like it alot, you can even try to volunteer there.   I'd say there's something about an art museum that is relaxing, almost like a slow, tender lull into dreams. Yet, beneath those dreams are quaking moments of creativity.   Conclusion: Phoenix Art Museum is a terrific way to spend a couple hours.

Beware the Vortex. Meaning, you think you're in the right area, but if you blink, you'll miss The Paper Heart. Of course, on 2nd circle 'round, you'll find out you're a moron and it's located beneath this super-giant U.S. Flag. It's at the corner (ish) of Grand and Van Buren.   Once inside, you can relax. There's no pretensions here. Nope, no fake sentiments and people wanting to be other people at this venue. Sure, we all have our problems, but this is one place in Phoenix where it's okay to be whatever it is you are (or want to be). Sit at the bar or on one of their several comfy couches. Order a drink - but beware of the prices. If you ask me, I don't think a $5 Guinness is a steal. Throw in a couple more buckaroos and I can get 6 bottles of my own... but I digress.   You'll be transplanted. (Pun intended? I don't know.) This gallery feels bigger and better than Phoenix. It's something you'd find in Boston or San Fran. Maybe even Seattle or Austin. So, this is definitely a deep gulp of fresh air, if you ask me.   From movies to local shows to poetry slams and charity events, this place is the pulse point for local artistic expression and talent. Sure, it may be hit-or-miss (the second time I went, the band never showed up), but that won't stop me from a) going back or b) recommending you go - with several friends in tow.   (Check their website for up-to-date info.)

I'm torn. 3 stars? Or 4? Should I split the diff and give it 3.5? I certainly could. But, I'll round-up. Here's why:   Getting to Biltmore is easy. Parking isn't a hassle, either. There's the garage behind Macy's that always saves a spot for me. How nice.   I like walking around to window shop and people watch. I like the off-chance I'll find a near-steal on a sales rack... cuz Lord knows the regular prices are just too absurd for me. Spend $158 on a new pair of jeans? Well, that's about 26 Guinness if each were $6 a pop. That's nearly one a day. So, yeah. I think my moolah is better spent elsewhere (and I know I can find Guinness for less than $6, so chances are I COULD drink one a day for an entire month for $158). Wait, what if I happen to stumble into a sales table and find jeans for $60? I can swing that... and sometimes you do get lucky at the Biltmore.   The stores here are a mix - like a buffet - something for everyone. From gadgets (Apple, Brookstone) to designer clothes (Escade) and shoes (oh, plenty of shoes!), you'll find most anything here, including coffee for you and a doggie treat for your pooch. (The latter I find absolutely absurd, by the way).   Plus, if you get a hankerin' for a movie, just cross under Camelback in the new, nifty underground passage over to the AMC at the Esplanade. Over there you'll find more treats for your taste buds, including Cold Stone and 7th Heaven Bakery. But, hey, let's face it, the AMC pretzels are pretty yummy, too. (And for wine after wards, hit up Merc Bar.)  I'm not sure Biltmore is an every weekend kind of place. Maybe once a month, if you feel like getting outside, wondering, need to buy a cool present or want to press your luck with a sales find. It's more fun when you take a friend, unless s/he's a serious shopper. Then you might never get 'em to leave. Then again, while they're on a retail rampage, you can always go chill at Borders... magazines, books, music, coffee... oh my! (Just be forewarned: For some reason, cell reception is pretty $hitty in the poetry section.)

Ordinary. That's what I think of this place.   As well as Colon Cleansing. Yep, that's right. The food is enjoyable - the big slices of eel nigiri really made my night. However, the next day, I wasn't so thrilled. Uhm, yeah.   If you have a group, sit at the Teppan tables and watch the show. That's the fun part. You can also order sushi for yourself, in case everyone else wants their food cooked before their eyes.   It's great that Mesa has a sushi place - I'll give 'em that. It's a good choice if you're in the area and don't feel like driving into Scottsdale or Phoenix. But, just be careful. Your food may escape your system faster than you can say, "Check, please."

I've had my own mountain bike for almost 2 years now. Shortly after I moved to Phoenix, my father and I decided to go get bikes so we could enjoy rides together. He lives about 7 miles from DNA Cycles in Mesa. So, this is where we went.   The staff was friendly and outgoing. They encouraged us to take whatever bikes we wanted out into the lot to ride 'em around. They talked with us about what we wanted to do with the bikes. My dad wanted to ride more on the street; I wanted to work up to conquering dirt paths. They recommended a 70% street bike for my dad, who could take it off-road if he wanted. They suggested I get a bike that is designed for more mountaineering but won't scoff at riding on pavement.   Their selection was wide enough that we had a somewhat difficult time deciding what to get. With the help of the staff, we narrowed our choices down and bought two bikes. My dad jokingly asked what he could get for free, and they guy who helped us joked back before throwing in two free water bottles. That was cool.   I didn't get any accessories or anything, but whenever I think about investing in a helmet or more padding on my tush, I always think of going back to DNA Cycles. They definitely treated us well!

Love this place! It's a used book store that offers at least 50% off their books. Fabulous.   I could explore the aisles all afternoon. They have a big poetry section and even carry contemporary poets, like Sharon Olds. Here is where I was given one of her more famous books, The Father. Literally. In the aisle. I was given the book. As a present. So thoughtful! Now that makes for one incredible memory, don't you think?   As I explored the fiction section, I saw many books that piqued my interest. In checking the price, I discovered I can pick up a new read for less than a Starbucks latte. Now that's a sweet deal. Seriously, who can resist a new book for $4 to $7?   Also, it's easy to find with plenty of parking. It's next door to Divinity Tattoo on Scottsdale Road, a hair North of Thomas (east side of the street). Great location, especially since it's in my 'hood.  This is now my go-to place for quality used books!

Hrm. Ever ask yourself where you can find a magazine that showcases all that is wrong with humanity - hedonism, addictions, overt sexuality, silicone, stupidity, bravado, high interest debit, cliques and a false sense of self? Well, look no further. 944 is here!   944 says it covers fashion, entertainment and lifestyle. Fact of the matter is it caters to the fantastical - you know, the unreachable celebrity stereotype of partying all night, spending benjamins and being seen where it's ultra cool to be seen.   I saw myself in 944 once. It was a double spread of Myst during their anniversary shindig. I was astounded to see myself in the middle of the dance floor with the most wretchedly uncomfortable grimace on my face. It was probably after I got hit in the head with an elbow or big lady purse. (I don't care if it's designer. It doesn't need to be the size of an Envoy.)   944 gets two stars from me. I could care less about the celebrity spottings and blond bimbo fundraisers. I do like how they sometimes feature music I'm into, as well as restaurants I may want to try. I don't even mind the showcase of expensive toys I'll never be able to afford. After all, it's fun to look. But 944 can't really consider itself a magazine, can it? After all, what value does it bring? Hardly enough, unless you're out of TP and need something to wipe your ass with.  Sad truth is that it is an unfortunate reflection of some of the people in this world. It's okay to admit there's more to life than your prada (or is it coach?) bag and being invited to the grand opening of "the next big thing" in Snottsdale.

I rue this place. Loath it. Despise it. Scowl whenever I think of my experience here. I'd give this place 0 or negative stars, if I could.  Sure, I can see how people would enjoy the low key atmosphere and the camaraderie of friends at a bar in Scottsdale that's not the least bit pretentious. It's not the bar, per se, that I have a problem with - it's the absurd activities during the week. (Of course, Giligin's has made its name based on its weekly events.) Ok, so I can laugh about a midget bartender just like everyone else can. That's funny. Sure, a midget stripper pole. Also funny. Scantily clad women handing out free shots? Eh, that doesn't even faze me nowadays.  It's not even the goldfish races that bother me. I guess it's the man in charge on the evening I went. Lewd. Crude. Obscene. Disrespectful. Sure, some people may like this, but I definitely don't. I don't want to hear a string of curse words coming out of a man holding a fishing pole with a dildo attached to the end. I don't want to see him waving it around in people's faces. I sure as hell don't want to see the end of the fishing line smack into a woman's face and the man laugh uproariously, calling the female all kinds of names and insinuating she likes it. You call this amusement? This is fun? This is entertainment? No. This is B.S. When you have to humiliate and degrade people to have a laugh, then you need to reconsider how you spend your downtime.   Ok, so maybe I'm coming off a bit strong here. It just riles me up to think people actually enjoy going out to be humiliated and talked down to, like they're scum. It annoys me to know a man is employed to be a complete and utter jackass. And, on top of that, the crowd urges him on while getting rapaciously sloshed.  I will never go back here. I want nothing to do with a place like this. In fact, I feel sort of bad for anyone who likes this place for the sheer fact that they can get a verbal beating by a dude with an IQ lower than the goldfish he torments.  If that's your bag, enjoy. Just leave me out of it.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  My Happy Hour comrad and I pulled up to Furio at 5 p.m. and got a front-row parking spot. Nice. Already, our experience was off to a great start. Then we saw the door. This massive, square glass door (outlined in a wood trim) that had a Furio F-shaped door handle with a subtle "pull" sign above it - it was all we could do to not stop and stare. Pulling the door open was easier than we imagined. We stepped right inside and both went, "Oh, wow..." The decor is very cool. With 70's retro hanging lamps (that look like cinnamon rolls, my friend said) with high-leg tables, high-back booths, slick white lounge chairs and a pink-tinted back-lit bar. We were instantly less stressed just being here. I had to try out the black high-back booth in the "lounge-y area." I sat down and was in love, I tell ya. The hostess, who was chipper, smiled at us. "Isn't that great? I love that." Then she sat down on one of the white chairs that looked like it was covered in a protective plastic coating. "Try these chairs." We sat down with her. Oh, very nice. That's when we decided to have our happy hour in this area. We both opted to sit on the bench with the comfortable high-back.   The shin-high table greeted us with a happy hour menu, along with a shimmering candle. Very nice. $4 glasses of their house wines - cab, merlot or chard. Nice! We bypassed the apple tini and cosmos. I wondered aloud about their "domestic" beers for $3. Come to find out, that only applies to the "great American lagers." We had to laugh with the waitress/bartender on that one. Double ugh for not even offering a deal on "super domestic" beers like 8th St. Ale and Kiltlifter, although they do carry them.   Nikki, our server/bartender, was great! It looked like she was covering the entire front portion of the place. She was attentive, informative and friendly. She had this unique Bohemian appeal, too. And her attire was comfortable, which made me curious about the place. "I think I could work here," I said. My friend laughed. "I was thinking the same thing. Maybe a return visit behind the bar?" I had no idea my friend has experience slinging drinks. Furio lent itself to free-flowing conversation, in which my friend and I got to know each other better. "That's 3 more percent about me you didn't know before," I was told. I'll drink to that!   We ordered Pane Rustica for $5. They were two medium-sized bistro-like sandwiches. One was chicken with tomatoes. The other had mushrooms. They were both heavenly. The bread - oh that bread! - was melt-in-your-mouth yummy. And for $5? It was like the perfect app to go along with our wine. I tried their house cab and was very impressed. My friend got their chard and enjoyed it. We toasted to banter, since it's so incredibly hard to find in a partner/love interest. But, man, when you do find it, wowza. It's amazing!   After sitting and chatting a while, soaking in the soothing lounge music (which we both really liked), we ordered their Build-Your-Own pizza for $7. The topping options are expansive, including eggplant and artichokes. We got it with everything, minus the prosciutto. It was very, very, very good! And for $7! We each were able to have 3 pieces to ourselves. Perfect. Another great food pairing with our individual wines.   I love Furio for happy hour, when I'm feeling like relaxing with wine and light bistro-like fare. Especially in an environment that has some of my favorite things: modern, comfortable furniture with good prices and relaxing lounge tunes.   There's also a nice outdoor patio with candlelight. Very romantic if you can go on a night that allows you have the patio all to yourself.   The bathroom is a one-person bathroom, which is nice. It's very big with a large mirror and pink walls. I liked it. It didn't come with any funky hard-to-operate sink, either. In that bathroom is where my friend picked up three Furio cards announcing regular events. Here's what she found:  Martini's & Manicures $10 for a Martini and a Manicure  Monday nights  Flight Night Featuring the latest and greatest in boutique wines  First Thursday of the month  1/2 Price Wine Every Sunday night  There are plenty of reasons to go back to Furio. Happy Hour being one, definitely. Checking out their weekly events is definitely another!   I'd give Furio 5 stars, but I can't, since this is a review of Happy Hour and I didn't see the full menu. Not to mention they only have yucky Bud, Coors and Michelob beer on their happy hour menu. That's reason enough to dock 'em one star. Too bad. I think I fell in love with Furio. And it only cost me $16 (with tip).

YUCK. And I mean that will all gusto behind the word. I absolutely did not like this place. It's very rare that I dislike a place this much. I usually can find something redeeming (like Los Olivos does have some pretty damn good salsa), but I could not see myself going here ever, ever again... unless my family dragged me here. They, of course, loved this place.   YUM. That's what my family said. I asked them what I should say in my review. My dad loved Los Olivos and said he'd rate 'em 4.5 stars. He only deducted the 1/2 star because they took our chips away before we were finished with them. I guess it was a bartering system: your entrees for our chips.   Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. After all, I didn't want to drown in grease, so I picked the shrimp entree that came with rice. I picked at the soggy rice. I nibbled on the burnt garlic toast. And the shrimp? Well, let's just say I wasn't expecting to have to work for my food. I had to peel the shell off myself. "How do I do that?" I asked horrified. Still a shrimp novice, I had no clue. "You grab their little legs and pull." I nearly had to excuse myself to go throw up.

This isn't *just* a lunch review. I say that so you'll understand that Cowboy Ciao is also a great option for mid-day dining. Of course I want to go back for dinner and check out that menu, but all in good time...  For lunch, my hungry co-workers and I decided Cowboy Ciao was a fantastic Plan B (After Geisha so rudely dismissed us). Some of us were concerned about the price, but I figured I'd enjoy my lunch, no matter the cost, since it wasn't everyday that I get to dine at such well-received places.   I ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio. It was on their "light" menu, with plates to share or options that won't leave you feeling overly stuffed. It was actually quite filling, with thin slices of seared buffalo, generous portions of goat cheese, a small green salad with beets and dried pieces of garlic bread (think upscale croutons). I loved everything but the dried bread. Oh well. It was soooo good, especially when combining the buffalo, goat cheese and green in a fork-full bite of pure enjoyment.   My friend got the famous (or infamous) Stetson Chopped Salad. Imagine my surprise when it was smoked salmon as the main meat - not beef, as I expected. Then again, when I think cowboy + stetson, I think beef. Wouldn't you? Turns out the salad isn't named in the cowboy theme (which is tastefully displayed in the decor) but for the name of the street. Ah-ha! Clever, Cowboy Ciao. You got me there.   Anyhow, the salad, though small for a hungry luncher, was beautiful presented - all ingredients lined up in rows, then "chopped" right before your eyes! My co-worker was a bit disapponted in the size of the salad for $12. It's definitely not something you should order if you're really hungry!  My other co-worker ordered the daily special - an ENORMOUS sandwich that consisted of bacon, avocado, tomatoes, rooster (i forget the "special culinary name" for this) and toasted ciabatta bread. It was HUGE. Definitely a bargain for $10. I heard it was damn good, too.   I also had a cup of their coffee. Yum. With fresh cream. I noticed it was a $3.00 cup, though. Dang. Next time I will accept the offer for a re-fill!   Soooo... what's the verdict? Cowboy Ciao gets my seal of approval. It's a great place for lunch, especially if you decide to split a couple "light" plates. You may even opt for desert. How can you miss the delectable temptations, when they're the first thing on the menu you see?   Cowboy Ciao, I'm on to you. You want me to be one of the many customers leaving behind witty remarks, don't you? You want me doing back-flips like an Olympic gymnast on my way out the door? Well, like I said, I'm on to you. But don't worry. It's a good thing. You definitely won me over, especially since, with tip, I was able to have a wonderful, satisfying lunch here for $20.   Oh yeah, and Sean, our server, was A+.   Can't wait to go back for dinner...

4 stars = Yay! I'm a fan.   However, I should put this into context.   Let's restructure the Yelp stars for a moment, shall we? When it's 2 a.m. and you've just danced your arse off for 2 hours in Old Town, what are your options for grabbing some food? Yep, you guessed it: Denny's.   4 stars = Yay! It's 2 a.m. and I'm freakin' hungry and I want food now!!! Oh, hi, Denny's, you're open and your food is edible.   So, uhm, yeah.   I had the smoked turkey sandwich. I ate every morsel. I was so hungry, it's true. It was about the best choice for the time - something with substance that wasn't a burger; something healthy that wasn't a meager salad.   I also had 2 hot cups of tea with honey. It may have been Lipton brand, but it was good. Again, I was hungry.   My brother had their Grand Slam sandwich. Everything inside looked and tasted yummy. The bread tasted like syrup, though. Icky.   My other brother had their super big hamburger. It was so big, I'm not sure how anyone eats it. But, he said it was good.   Nothing like chowin' down on some Denny's grub after the club, yo.

Delish!   I can't even begin to tell you the number of different dishes I've ordered here, but each one always satisfies. There's always plenty to take home for second servings.   The service is average - definitely nothing to complain about, but certainly nothing to wow you. But, that's ok. The food is served in a timely manner, as are your initial drinks. Try the Thai Tea. It's a treat.

My brother, who was on leave, loves this place. Seeing my brother happy is what matters. So, 5 stars goes to Drift.   Granted, it was a lowkey Thursday night. Only a few patrons were sprinkled around the place; some even outside close to the fire.   I ordered a pitcher of Four Peaks' Island Ale. Why? Because as they said in Boston, it's cheapah! Besides, I had never had it before; it's quite good! Our server was kind enough to let me sample the Kona Lager and the Ale before I ordered. Did I finish the pitcher? Heck no. Can one person seriously drink all that? Wowza.   My bro enjoyed their Jack and Cokes.   And the music was cool. A very interesting mix. At one point, my bro requested "Pepper" by the BHS. They played it! That made my brother's night, and, like I said earlier, seeing my bro happy is what it's all about.   I ordered their little kabob app - one shrimp, one chicken, one beef. It was merely okay. I wouldn't order it again. Frankly, I wasn't impressed with their menu. I probably wouldn't suggest eating here, but if you want to stop in for a drink or to try the rare Four Peaks' brew, then it's a great spot. I like the outside area (minus the smoking) and enjoyed the decor of the inside.   Oh, and the servers look like they're actually comfortable at work - comfy shoes, track suits. They're also very nice, unlike other Scottsdale establishments.   Like John V said, this place is a cool spot to wind down... or, if you're looking to get out for a little bit, go on a lowkey night. You'll likely have the place to yourself.  Again, 5 stars for makin' my lil brother happy.

Wow. That's what I'll start off by saying.   I'm giving Dan M. 5 enormous stars. He was professional, attentive, creative, accommodating and, most of all, honest. He'll tell you about complimentary colors and placement. He helped me get a tattoo I absolutely love. I could not be happier. Honestly.   Don't judge the place or the artists by the girl behind the counter. She seems a bit out of it. I'm sure she means well, but damn, talk about the wrong first impression. I'm glad I decided to stick with Divinity. I picked Dan M. out of the portfolio books on the counter. His shading and line work are top-notch. I already want another tat! And I can guarantee I'll go back to him, without a moment's hesitation. He is such a laid back, friendly and talented artist. You'll see for yourself; some of his own personal art hangs on the wall. He's very talentd!  I really wish I could capture just how great he and my experience was. Alas, words escape me. But, trust me, if you're looking to get a tattoo, check out Divinity. Walk in; take a look at the portfolios; book an appointment. Hell, just say you want to book your appointment with Tattoo Dan! (That's what he told me to call him, since there's also a Piercing Dan.)  While you're there, check out the really cool decor. It's such a cool looking tat shop with personality. The atmosphere is very relaxing, which is key, I think, to getting a great tat. No need to work yourself up into a tizzy - or you may pass out like a Frenchman did! Just relax. The pain is part of the pleasure. Ya gotta earn your ink!  While at Divinity, I heard a wide range of music. I was afraid it was going to be the Satan-Worship-Scream-Rock all the time, since that's what I heard when I booked my appointment the week before. Luckily, I heard none of that during the 5 hours I was chillin' at Divinity.   When I sat down to get inked, Radiohead came on. Perfect. My tat took about 30 minutes (from first needle prick to last), but Dan M. was helpful in talking with me beforehand about shading, size, placement, treatment, etc. He wanted to make sure I left happy. Well, Dan, I didn't leave happy. I LEFT ECSTATIC! I'm so glad I went through with it, found a design I absolutely love and got it exactly where and how I wanted it (with a little guidance from Dan.) I can't wait to go back to get my next one!   Tips for your next, new tat: *When booking, drop in to look at the books on the counter - see which artists aligns with the type of tat you're looking for. If you want superb work, go with Tattoo Dan. He's the man.  *Stock up on Vaseline and anti-bacterial soap. You'll need it. *Get ready to pay $40 deposit when you book your appointment. (The $40 goes toward the total price of your ink.) *Bring in a sketch or picture of what you want, so the artist can book adequate time for you.  *Try and be sure of what you want. The guys don't like it when clients change their mind at the last minute, for it puts them behind with other clients and you may have to re-schedule your own appointment due to the extra time it'll take. If you do change your mind, drop in a couple days before your appt and give 'em your new sketch/pic. They'll appreciate it!  *Make sure to eat before you get inked. *Get ready to earn your ink! While my tat barely hurt, it's cool to know you gotta endure a little pain for something so meaningful and beautiful!

NO AMBER ALE??? NO AMBER ALE!!!  Wow, okay. And you call yourself a bar. Your Web site boasts all these beers you offer, on tap or by the bottle. What a f'n joke. Oh, I get it. Is this another prank? Seems to be the worst one possible. I mean, sure, you offer plenty of make-me-puke domestics to satisfy any obese truck driver, but what about little ol' me who's just looking for a nice amber to enjoy during HH?   I was snubbed.   This place is pretty large, I'll give 'em that. There's plenty of TVs to watch, while you nosh on cheap (and I do mean cheap!) apps during HH. My friend and I split the veggie tray (huge!) and Cajun chicken sliders on mini-croissants. (Good but kind of plain and dry.) The RED SEOX game was on a huge TV screen. Very cool! There wasn't any sound on during any of the games, until it was time for the Suns to play. Then most of the TVs went to that game and the sound came on. So, NOTE TO SUNS FANS: This could be a very good place to watch a game, while enjoying traditional bar food and a brewski (or several).  The patrons are what I'd call mostly "blue collar." Nothing wrong with that. They are some of the hardest working people, who are friendly and offer the best tips. I grew up around these kinds of folks. I felt pretty comfortable here, but I was with a friend. I highly doubt I'd venture here solo, for nothing screams "open hunting season" like a young, pretty girl sitting at the bar by herself. And I couldn't say, "Oh, I came for the amber ale..." Blue Collar Chilvary isn't the same in Phoenix as it is in Oklahoma... (trust me on this one)  Moving on...  Service was great. We had three attentive servers check on us during our short HH stay. My friend and I split a mini-pitcher of Blue Moon for $5. Yeah, I told you this place was cheap. If we had a DD, I'm sure we could have polished off another $10 worth!  Between 2 apps and 1 mini-pitcher AND tip, I spent around $13 here. Maybe that makes me cheap? I'd prefer to think of it as frugal.  While this place offers TVs galore and even a separate area for games (arcade-style included), I didn't find much about this place that would warrant a return trip. It would be a fun place for a group of friends to hit up during HH (if you're frugal like me and want to get alot of bang for the buckaroo) to order mini-pitchers ($5!), while challenging each other to various game competitions. Will the Real Big Dog please stand up?   I can't believe they didn't have an Amber Ale... They did offer two Hefs and an array of others, including Kiltlifter for those who like your local red ale. But - GASP - while the place was decorated with all types of beer merchandise and empty 6-pack boxes adorned the tables with condiments, Prankers Too did not offer any Sam Adams. NONE!   There went Plan B... (grumble, grumble)  So, no Amber Ale. No Sam Adams.   One more strike, and you're out of here!

***UPDATE*** This place is hit or miss. While I LOVED my first experience here, I HATED my second (and last). The place was entirely too packed and loud. I felt like I was standing in everybody's way and couldn't really enjoy my drink or the conversation with my date.   * * *  Wow, a bar in Scottsdale that's friendly, laid back and inviting in such a way that you never want to leave. In fact, you want to keep ordering drinks while you claim a table near the fireplace and dart board. Yes, when I got to TT Roadhouse, I didn't know what to expect. When I walked in, I saw Christmas lights, wooden benches and people gathered around the bar. These people were "real" people with tats, facial hair, unkempt hair. Some were even a bit dingy in appearance. Charming, if you ask me. I felt immediately comfortable, like I didn't have to worry about being anything but myself. I took a good look around and saw that the people here with me probably felt the same way - hence why they were there that night.   Fact of the matter is, I didn't want to leave. But, considering I didn't drive, I had no choice. Yet, if I had gotten my way, I would have stayed here longer. In fact, I probably would have skipped the previous two bars and made a bee-line for TT's. I mean, this place is the closest I've come to discovering a small, cool and relaxed bar in Scottsdale. (Reminds me of neighborhood bars you'll find in Chicago.)  You won't find fake blondes here, unless they're platinum blonde with plugs and mary janes. No, I don't mean to sound stereotypical. I just like how you can walk into this bar and "fit in." It doesn't matter if your shirt's the only clean-smelling one you could find in your dirty hamper or if it's the brand new one you found at your fave retailer. Whatever. S'all good here.   Even better, the bartender! C'mon now. There's something romantically bizarre about a super tall man with dred locks behind the bar, overseeing the entire establishment as if he were also the security dawg. He had a "tough guy" persona. I bet, though, he's one cool mofo. In fact, he reminded me of my fave House DJ, Donald Glaude. Perhaps that's why I immediately liked him. He had that air about him, like he'd be one of the funniest people you'd ever meet. He was also quick to notice me when I went up to place my order. Earlier in the night, when my fave bar comrad and myself went to order a round for ourselves and our friends, we said, "One snakebite." Then we began to have a quick-paced convo with Bartender Glaude about what was in that mix. "Isn't it Cider?" "No, I think it's Bass." "No, maybe it's Bass and Cider." Ah, classic!   One thing I did notice, though, was that when we walked in, there was no music playing. It took a good 10 minutes for anything to come on. That was a bit off-putting. But, once the tunes started, I settled into the booth by the fireplace and enjoyed my Black Velvet and a game of friendly darts.

Warning: It's dark here. You may have to squint to see your food, or your date for that matter. The wait staff is friendly, although not very educated on wine pairings. Good thing I had my date to assist me. The chicken is super yummy, although quite large for one person. The sides are good, too. We had plenty left over and took it to go. I can attest that the food is just as good warmed up the day after.   This is a good date spot, although I wish it weren't in Old Town in the tourist trap. It takes away from the appeal of going. But, don't let the location prevent you from trying it once. It's worth it.

"Who's that sleeping near the apples?"  Yes, someone may eventually ask, for I'm moving into the produce section. Talk about gorgeous with the most beautiful apples I've ever seen. I picked one up and just stared at it, transfixed. It was like poetry. But, don't forget the lush green veggies and herbs. And the vibrant berries. Yep, I'm living here. Right in the produce section. It's like nothing I've ever seen before.   I also want to give the card aisle one big, happy hug. I found the PERFECT birthday card for my lil sis here. Talk about awesome. I could not have asked for a better card. I know, I know. It's just a card... but it's not. It's for my lil sis. And it's her birthday. So, finding that card was like falling in love for the first time. (Hallmark can kiss my... Ahem. AJ's offers, surprise, higher quality cards that cost a bit more. Totally worth it.)  They also have whole wheat lavosh crackers here. Not the nasty-for-you enriched stuff either. REAL whole wheat crackers. Oh, and while we're talkin' carbs, visit the bread section. Sniff the cranberry spice loaf. Yes, SNIFF IT! It's magical. And then buy a loaf. Seriously. Try the pumpernickel or whole wheat. It's the best store-bought bread ever, hands down.   Oh, and beer. Can you tell I can ramble on about this store endlessly? I love the beer aisle, too. I love that I can buy a 6-pack or select individual bottles. Love it! I stood in front of the section just admiring the delicious-looking brew. I'm sure people passing by thought, "She must be a recovering alcoholic." I walked away empty-handed. Why? Well, I didn't stop in for the beer. I stopped in for the bread. (And did I tell you I found the most perfect birthday card too? Talk about kismet!)   AJ's, I love you. I even love your ultra-modern shaded parking. I felt spoiled. So did my '98 Pontiac, which felt like it had finally - for once - snuck into an R-rated movie.   AJ's, I'd give you 5-stars and deem you perfection on earth, but - and this is huge - you cost too much. You're like a Scottsdale Bunny livin' it up for the money, honey. I ain't down with that.

I was here for a wine tasting event, so keep that in mind.  HOWEVER (and it's a big one) I think you can tell a lot about a place in how they treat somebody holding an event there. It's in the details, methinks, and Terrior didn't do such a hot job in hosting about 35 wine tasters. They ran out of food right away and were incredibly slow in replenishing. In fact, I think they brought out 2 trays of food the entire 3 hours of the wine tasting event.   I managed to taste a small slice of their pizza, along with some cheese. Maybe the event organizers and the venue disagreed, but the cheeses were suppose to be from Europe. They ended up being your run-of-the-mill cheese: jack, swiss and chedder. And the fruit they were paired with were - shocking! - Granny Smith apples and crunchy pears. Oh, and also slices of plain white bread. Meh.   The tasting was suppose to introduce 4 new blends. Again, I think the organizers of the event and the venue must've disagreed. For the two whites that were served were not exactly what was advertised. And they weren't good, on top of that. I had the one with the Viogner blended in, and I took one sip and put it down. That's when I decided to try the red blends. Uhm, they were mediocre. If this is what the venue presents to impress wine tasters, then they should re-consider. Seriously. I finally manged to find a red blend I liked, but then they ran out of wine! Seriously... I didn't pay $25 to come to an event for only one glass of wine!   Since my friends and I weren't able to snag some food at the event, we ordered their cheese tray. They would customize the cheeses - at a price. So we went with their standard, which, like I said, came with Granny Smith apples, pears and dry bread. Ugh. So not impressed.  This place boasts about being unpretentious and a place for the everyday wine drinker who doesn't know much about wine. Well, even if that's the case, please learn to do a better job at hosting events and presenting a cheese tray that doesn't make everyone at the table scoff and grumble with disappointment.  REDEEMING QUALITIES:  *The interior of the "wine pub" is small yet homey.  *They have two separate patio areas.  *Their bottles for sell are reasonably priced (you can get a great pinot noir for $20).  *They do sell beer here. A pretty wide selection at that.  *You can join their Beer Club and/or Wine Club for a monthly fee.

Trader Joe's Scottsdale. It's not your average Trader Joe's. Nor is it your extraordinary. Don't get me wrong. I like TJs. I've been intrigued by this chain of stores since stumbling into one with my best bud in Detroit. (She lives there and was the first to introduce me.) You see, in Oklahoma City, we don't have Trader Joe's. We don't really have anything like it, to be frank. Albertson's may be as upscale as ya get, unless things have changed since I moved away.   Here in Phoenix you have a slew of options for snagging a bag of groceries. Fry's. AJ's. Safeway. Fresh & Easy. World Market. Food City. Even Walgreens and Target. How does one ever decide? Where's the loyalty?   Well, I'm now a loyal shopper of Trader Joe's. It didn't take long to convince me. Nor did it take much. You see, I can run into Trader Joe's with a few things on my list to get, and then be convinced to pick up a few curiosities, like their split pea soup or chicken sausage. Even when "binging" at the store, I never walk away spending too much. You can't do that at Fry's, Safeway or AJs - believe me. Anytime I stray from my list at those places, I end up paying at least 30% more than I anticipated. Trader Joe's serves me well. I'm able to get what I want and need, as well as explore what's out there - without feeling like I went buck wild in the frozen foods aisle. I can even pick up a tasty bottle of wine or build my own 6-pack without breaking $10. Nice!  So, as for this Trader Joe's, I'd say if you like dealing with swarms of people in an overly cramped space, then go for it. As for me, the one time I went here, I soon felt trapped and claustrophobic. Not to mention it was so crowded, somebody knocked over a bottle of wine and it splattered everywhere. (Oddly, people didn't seem to think anything of it. Must happen alot in closet spaces.)  I think I'll keep shopping at the one at 20th and Camelback, or venture to Mesa or Tempe to try the ones there.

Only a few things in life really, really excite me to where I kick my legs up or clap my hands with glee. Having Rogue's Hazelnut Brown on tap is one of them. Here, at Papago Brewery, they call this beer "nectar." I call it "the beer that started it all." That is, I was always interested to check out this place, but I was never more sold until I heard they sold Rogue here. REALLY?! Yes, really.   So, guess what I ordered? Uh-huh. My beer buddy had the Sunshine from New Belgium (also good). Our first server was a nice, curly-haired lad, although he seemed to be sleep-walking. Our second was a friendly tattooed man who reminded us of Dave Navarjo. Having heard I wanted to try one of Papago's own, he brought out four - count them! - four samples for me to try. I went with the Red Ale, for it was the best out of the bunch. Not that the others were lacking. They were all good, but the Red Ale surpassed them all.   Did I mention there was also a young lady helping us? Yep, so in actuality, we had THREE people at Papago taking care of us. Where else is that gonna happen?  So, my friend and I chatted, enjoyed our beers and gazed lovingly at the refrigerated shelves of beer mecca. You see, here at Papago, you can get some to go. Or, if nothing on tap fancies you, you can select from the stock on shelf and have it right at your table. YOU HEARD ME! This is a wickedly cool idea.   After my friend and I shared the Beer-B-Que pizza, which uses Hazelnut Brown to make the sauce, I selected some beer to go. The Rogue selection here is great. They even had Monk Madness, which you can't find at BevMo. I snatched that up. I should have gotten Rogue's Red Ale, too. Instead, I took up the $8.50 for 6 12oz bottles of American beer. That's mix-and-match, folks. That's another amazing thing about Papago Brewery. Our server (the DN look-alike) was helpful in suggesting ales for me to try. That was appreciated, for he already sort of had an idea of what I gravitated toward, based on my earlier orders.   I ended up walking away with a variety 6-pack and large bottle of Monk Madness, which costs only $4.69. Talk about a steal!   So, yes... Papago Brewery, you sure got my attention! Rogue Beer on tap and for sale. Not to mention they also had Rare Vos and Three Philosophers - two New York beers I haven't seen on sale anywhere else (unless you count The Lost Leaf). DON'T GET ME STARTED on the many others I've seen here that I haven't seen anywhere else... including a Japanese label I am curious to try.  So, while the decor may be lacking and there was no music playing the entire time we were there, I am giving Papago Brewery my seal of approval.   Let's re-cap (or uncap, if you will) the awesomeness: *Attentive, fast and knowledgeable service *Hazelnut Brown on tap!!!  *Beers by the bottle for sale - to drink in the bar or take home *An enormous selection of beer available (like Rogue!) *Good prices and tasty bar food  I will definitely be back!  PLEASE NOTE: The crowd can be a strange mix of people. And the place can get LOUD! I don't know if it's the acoustics of the venue or if the patrons there just like raising their voices. Either way, I prefer to go earlier in the day, as opposed to later. If you go, you'll see what I mean.

I love Jamba Juice. I hate Jamba attitude.   Jamba deserves 5 stars for its array of flavors, boosters and options for juice, smoothie, etc. Yet, when the manager stands there and patronizes you and seems to be annoyed that you want to cash in on a free 16 oz jamba juice (from a promo card that was a gift from another Jamba manager), then I have a problem. This Jamba is worthy of only 2 stars because, let's face it, the teens behind the counter know how to make a mean peanut butter moo'd smoothie and instruct you that the straw tends to get stuck to the bottom of the cup. So, instead of sucking up all the air in the room, you can dutifully swirl the yummy cup contents and exercise the straw enough until the Jamba froth touches your tongue.   I'll definitely be going back for the peanut butter smoothie. I just won't be going back to this Jamba Juice.

First impressions aren't everything. So, I feel entirely justified re-Yelping the British Open after having been here three times. Sometimes you need repeat outings to really get the full "feel" of a place, right?   MY FIRST TIME: The crowd was mixed. You could easily find yourself face-to-face with "creepy old guy" when you first walk in. At least I did. But, he's not "stalker creepy guy" so it's okay. I can deal with that. Apparently it's okay to have a baby in the bar, too. Startin' 'em young, I tell ya.   On the jukebox: The Black Keys, Wilco, Freeze Pop, Sarah McLachlan.  The beer menu offered selections from various countries. Nothing on tap appealed to me, so I went with the Sam Smith's Nut Brown. Very good. I had never had it before. That is probably my beer of choice at the British Open. I'd like to try the Oatmeal Stout, too.   I don't think I'd go out of my way to frequent the B.O. Pub. It's in an obscure and generic retail plaza. That doesn't bother me so much as the "mediocre" vibe I got while sitting at the table. I guess the British Open and myself just didn't "click." That's okay. Not every bar and myself can have that special kind of chemistry. It's an organic thing, I tell ya. It's Pub Kismet.   * * *  SECOND HELPINGS: (summary)  I sat at the bar this time. The service was faster. I perused the menu with my date and our friend. My date and I sampled a couple beers. I had the Whitbread Ale. It was okay. But... alas... COULD IT BE? Yes. It was Love At First Sip when I tried the Heather Ale from Scotland. This ale is aromatic and is made with lavender. Uhm, could you want anything else? I savored every sip and made the declaration that I love this pub for this ale alone -- and that I don't know if I can get this anywhere else.   While at the bar, we got "troubled" to sign a petition to make St. Pat's Day a national holiday. For handing over our hancocks, we got free pins and pens. Nice.   ***  ST. PATRICK'S DAY: (a short story of celebration)  As luck would have (luck of the Irish?), my friend and I touched on the British, Scottish and Irish in an hour's time - not to mention grabbed the last table when we walked in shortly after 5 p.m.   We came to the BritOpen, for I wanted my friend to try the Heather Ale, and I selfishly wanted to be part of a celebration at what could pass as a St. Patrick's Day-friendly establishment. So, we sat among other St. Pat's fans, while we drank one of the best ales either of us has ever had. We got asked if we wanted to order a Killian's, since they were $2 and you'd get a free shot glass with your order. Plus a bag of malts to try. Interesting. After the Heather Ale, my friend ordered a Killian's at the bar, where they weren't handing out the freebies. Bummer. We did manage to track down a couple free shot glass - for what it's worth.   We were about to leave when the Irish music stopped. We turned and saw a "band" of bagpipers and drummers and the like start playing outside the pub, framed in the open doorway. Then they walked through the crowd to stand near the jukebox/TV screen to play some songs. It was incredible! My friend said, "I feel like my homeland is calling." She is, after all, a beautiful Scottish lass.   After their rendition of "Amazing Grace," we made our subtle exit. That's when I knew I had to re-Yelp this place. After all, bagpipes? Heather Ale? Good prices? Close to work and where I live?  Yeah, I will definitely be hanging out here again...and again... and again!  *** BEWARE: Their Sampler Plate is NASTY, with just a pinch of "meh." The pickles who WHOLE, not cut into chips, like the menu implies. The duck is inedible. Ick. The cod bites were the only decent things on the platter. I did enjoy the tarter sauce!

Cream cheese in rolls. Loud, obnoxious music. You have to scream to talk. This is the epitome of trendy. Ra doesn't serve sushi. They serve pretentious hype.   Give me authentic. Give me style. Give me an experience that doesn't make my ears ring.   Simply, there are far superior places to go for sushi.   Oh, but what if you don't go for the food? Are you going for the social scene? The drinks? To be with the in-crowd? Oh, then ignore my rating. I'm only concerned with the fish.

With award shows and ceremonies, there are categories and nominees. Best actor in a drama. Best comedy or musical. Best director. Well, if "best local brewery" were a category, I think Four Peaks would win, hands down. Of course, I haven't been to every single brewery here in Phoenix, but I have been to enough bars to know that there's something endearing and cool about Four Peaks. Perhaps as a stand-alone bar, it would be mediocre. The fact that it's a local brew house makes it even cooler. It's like the average guy getting a thousand dollar make over. He just looks fabulous, doesn't he?   Gotta love the exposed brick walls, the open yet enclosed feeling of the layout with tables surrounding the bar area, which is in the center. The ceilings are high. The TVs are dedicated to sports. The huge chalk board boasts a diverse menu. There's also a pretty big patio out front. The doorman was nice - even humorous. I was instantly "in like" with this place.   Four Peaks has quite the crowd of fans, too. Be weary if you plan to hit this place up on a Friday around 8. You'll bump head-first into the "happy hour meets dinner crowd." No bueno if you're looking for a seat at the bar. Good luck finding a table, too. You might as well just order yourself a beer and find somewhere to stand out of the way of the bus boys and friend clans. Interestingly enough, as dinner time expires, the crowd thins. Finding a seat at the bar around 9 and 9:30 at night becomes less of a challenge. Did you take note of that? You should. I'm sayin' this: don't be afraid to mosey up to Four Peaks around 10 o'clock. It's less crowded than if you came two hours earlier. Trust me on this one.   Also, bring all the good karma you can find. You'll need it to find a parking spot on the street that's a short walk to the front door. Otherwise, you may have to put your peds to good work. Not that it's a big deal, unless it's a frosty January night or muggy/bright/furiously hot summer day.   Beer's are cheap, too. Under $3 for their Oatmeal Stout, which is my brew of choice. Sure, I bet the others are worth their weight, but once I find what works for me, I stick with it. So, if you go and you find something worth drinking, let me know.   NOTE: Not the brightest bulbs behind the bar. Our 2nd round was free by default. We got served. We just didn't get charged. Bonus!

UPDATE: I think this place caught fire and closed. Whoops. (But I do believe they're back in business now.)  This is my Mill Ave. restaurant of choice. With a decent wine selection, I suggest your try the Aqua Orange Pinot Noir. If you like fish, this is your place. The Salmon is great. Oh, and did I mention that their BBQ Chicken pizza is heaven-sent? They also offer a Jerk Chicken to please those less adventurous eaters. Not to mention a very delicious filet.   Can you tell I've eaten here often?  Well, I have.   This place is on the list for KAET donors and their discount passports, so I do like to go eat here - great food, great price for a great cause!  Their chocolate desserts are yummy, too.   And I like the decor. The flame the greets you when you walk up to the entrance is pleasing to the eye. I could do without the TV broadcasting all things sports (just contradicts the vibe - not that I don't like sports).   I like the musica, generally, when it's 80's and very fun loving.

OU LOST! OU LOST! OU LOST!  This makes me very giddy! Just for the Sooners losing, I give the Fiesta Bowl 5 stars.   Ok, so maybe Glendale and the actual bowl had nothing to do with West Virginia's victory. I understand that. It's logical to point that out. I get it. I just don't care.  OU LOST! OU LOST! OU LOST!   I enjoy the fact that so many Sooners turned up at the Insight Bowl to prance their team colors around. I love it that they wore those same colors to the Fiesta Bowl only to lose! Yes, it fills me with glee. Pure, unadulterated happiness, I tell ya!   For both the Insight Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl, I give Arizona props. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience - to go watch my alum win their bowl and soon watch the annoying crimson-and-cream snobs lose theirs!   In case you hadn't heard yet... OU LOST! OU LOST! OU LOST!

Their Angus burger is incredible. So is their Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno. According to their website: "Poblano pepper stuffed with a seasoned filling of smoked chicken, chopped pecans, apricots, jack cheese and raisins. Served with green chile mole, roasted tomato cream, Tejas rice and black beans."  Let me tell ya, it's so worth it!   The atmosphere is cool, too, although it gets a bit noisy Fridays around 6 p.m. The lighting is dim and it's conveniently located off Mill Ave, so you can always spring for Gelato after wards, or just wander the street, checking out stores and people watching.

I had the most bizarre experience here last night. As the location for the b-day dinner with family, I arrived a bit late (hey, I parked near N. Mill and wanted to walk) and walked in hurriedly, looking around to spot familiar faces. To my left, I saw a young woman waving at me. I looked at her; she looked at me. I looked at the hostess; the hostess looked at the young lady. I looked away to try and spot my family. The young woman waved again. I furrowed my brows and looked around - was she waving at somebody behind me? I looked at the hostess again, who looked equally befuddled. I walked in the direction of the young woman. She said happily, "Alison!" I stepped closer, leaned down to let her get a good, clear look at my face and whispered, "I'm not Alison." Then I walked off, turning the corner and locating my party. Of course I had to tell the story to my family. It was bizarre, after all. The hostess walked by a couple minutes later (while I was telling the story) and said, "Did she think you were someone else?" I pointed at the hostess to add credibility to my story. "See, exactly."  That set the stage for a very enjoyable and often humorous dinner. From the topics of "best friends with naked benefits" to dirty playground jokes to politics, we discussed a wide range of topics. We also enjoyed our meal. I had a salad with shrimp. The waiter was happy to accommodate my request to substitute shrimp with chicken. I also ordered a 22 oz Blue Moon (on happy hour price). Since it was both my and my brother's birthday (we are 5 years apart), we got two free desserts. I let my family select what dessert they wanted. I would have gone with something chocolate, though. My brother went with the white chocolate lava cake. So did my parents. I ate a little bit of it, but soon noticed that my inability to eat white chocolate hasn't change. It's just way too sweet.   As for the meals, everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. My dad got the Guiltless Salmon with extra veggies. My brother order fajitas. My step mom got something she didn't order, although it did have chicken and shrimp in the mix. She picked at it. When I tasted a piece of her shrimp, I noticed it tasted burnt. Gross. No wonder she didn't eat much. She didn't seem to mind, though.  As for the service, it was great. The waiter knew it was a birthday dinner. He was attentive and fast. When the check came, a manager came over to ask whose birthday it was. I, slightly buzzed, gestured wildly and unrestrained to communicate it was mine birthday, as well as my little brother's. The manager thought that was cool. "It's also their grandpa's birthday," my step-mom said. My brother chirped up, "And the cat's!"   We hugged our goodbyes in front of Chili's and my brother and I set off down N. Mill to find something else to do to celebrate. All in all, a very nice birthday dinner. Chili's may not have been my first choice in "fine dining" on such an occasion, but I know it's family-friendly and pretty standard in the food and service it delivers. Usually I avoid chain restaurants like genital warts (or so I try), but I can hang at Chili's. After all, they have a little bit of something for everyone.

Gordon Biersch has an upstairs outside patio, where you can sit and look down at Mill while enjoying food and beer. It's one of the few accommodations that drew me in - not to mention they have their own beer to sample. I chose the seasonal. It was pretty good, although very, very filling. I couldn't even drink 1/2 of it after having dinner (shrimp salad) and another beer (22 oz) prior to coming here. So, if you plan to drink their beer, make sure you bring your extra stomach along. You're gonna need it.   As for the food, never had it. I can't speak to that, but it looks like serve American fare - like pizzas and burgers. They also have a very tempting dessert menu. I should know. My brother and I checked it out last night, after learning you get a free dessert on your birthday. Since it was a birthday for both of us, we contemplated getting one, like the apple bread pudding or the chocolate peanut butter cup pie.   Service was beyond horrible. Sure, we were quickly shown to a table, but it took several moments for our server to come over. She took our drink orders and told us about the free dessert - after all, I did let her know it was a special day. My bro and I drank and talked, enjoying the night air. Yet when we decided to leave, we could not find our server anywhere. We waited. We looked around. We waited some more. We finally decided to get up and leave. We found her standing at the hostess table doing nothing. That's when she was like, "Do you guys want to close your tab out?" Uh, yeah. That's what we wanted 20 minutes ago, missy. So, we slapped down $15 (our tab was $14 for one beer and one Rum Runner - whoa) and left.   "What if we had wanted something to eat?" my brother asked. "Yeah, I said. She didn't even check." We just shook our heads and both agreed we probably wouldn't ever go back. Or, if I did, I'd know not to set my expectations too high.  On a more positive note: my brother did say it was the best Rum Runner he's ever had. That's gotta be worth something, right? I've had their mojitos before - meh. While I know they have a full bar, I think having their own in-house brewery is very cool.

May 07 UPDATE:  Just saw Black Rebel Motorcycle Club here. Maybe it's the venue or just the f'n amazing bands I've seen at the joint. Either case, I'll be back.   Be prepared to stand for quite some time. Get there early to avoid a parking snafu. Come ready to be frisked. If you're 21+, there's good ol' refreshments to be had. Bathrooms are relatively clean, considering.   The acoustics are a bit questionable, though. Big disappointment.  I saw The Black Keys here in Sept 2006. It was the best show I saw all year. Incredible Akron OH guys just jamming to the brink of exhaustion. I applaud them... and I tip my proverbial hat to Marquee for bringing them to town.

I must admit, I don't think Ethiopian food is my end all, be all. I've had it twice since moving to Phoenix. It's not that I shy away from eating with my hands. It's not that I don't appreciate the culture, or how unique of a dining experience this is... authentic as you're going to get in the Valley, I can imagine.   It's not any of those things... I think it's the food. Now, c'mon, I'm not going to lie. The food is tasty. It's just not what gets me going. I went to Lalibela with a couple co-workers. I was looking to get out of the office and enjoy some chit chat. Mission accomplished. Yet, can 3 people seriously get full from sharing a plate of Lalibela's finest? I think not. Besides, I get kinda skeeved out when dirt or food gets caught under my nails. Yikes. (Watching my co-workers pick at their fingers after the meal was not the most pleasing way to polish off my lunch.)  Sounds like I'm complaining, right? Well, I'm not trying to. I mean, this place is good. Don't get me wrong! I s'pose if you enjoy Ethiopian food and eating with your hands (and strange textures and really thin bread), then this is the place for you.   I give it 4 stars for what it is: a really good Ethiopian restaurant... With, if you didn't know, really good chai tea. Oh, and the food... Well, I'll let you decide for yourself. Maybe it's your end all, be all.

Hyper awaits, be forewarned. It's behind the counter, to be exact. Rather amusing to me, the super-charged cashiers may be too much for others.   If you like tea and can stand it hot, try the Earl Lavender. I can vouch for the iced coffee and chai (iced and hot) - both great options. I hear the scones are good, too.   I like walking into this place, seeing strangers, old co-workers and random people geeking it up with their laptops. I like catching strange snippets of conversation. You never know what'll drag itself off Mill Ave and through the doors.   Downside: Bathrooms are sketchy. You'd think they'd be able to invest in some Mr. Clean Bleach for the floors and the walls. Oh well. I guess coffee is their forte. And since the coffee is good, I'm okay with an ick bathroom, an establish full of random and unique people and the fact that they're located off Mill -- their spot is actually a welcome relief from the trying-to-be-trendy boutiques and places to munch.   If you're bored during the evening, head here with a friend. Sit outside and chat. Or grab your goods and walk around. That's what I like to do.   There is a Starbucks nearby, too, if that's your addiction. But, c'mon, give this place a try. Deviate. Experiment. Expand your coffee bean horizon.

Hello, NPR.  You've given me music interviews, including Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. You've given me commentary on the Amy Winehouse revolution and young female singers/songwriters from other countries who are really making an impact in the music industry.    You've given me discussion on the search for happiness, and how to harness my sadness for good. Timely, too, since I just read an article about how sadness can make one analyze their life and strive for improvement.   You've given me sports theater, parodying Tom Brady and Eli Manning before the Super Bowl in what would make Shakespeare cock an eyebrow.  You've given me Sunday breakfast with the Beatles. Enough said.  You've given me so much in a short amount of time, KJZZ. And what have I given you? 1) Your very own programed radio button. 2) Two petite ears.

"Don't mess with me." That's my motto when I'm looking for movies. I like to walk the aisles, from new releases to classics to foreign hits... It's all a gold mine.   I've been to this location a few times -- I'm a new member, actually. Sign-up was easy and I get 1/2 off my movies for the first month. Perfect for the July month, if you ask me. So, I've been eager to go pick and choose movies to watch.   Each time I've gone, there has been a great selection of new releases. I blame my indecision as not knowing what to get, although, if you wait too late, even the movies you want to see will be picked over. (But that's just common sense, right?)   Ok, so maybe I do have one complaint. It's their display boxes. If the movie isn't in, you can't read the back... Try it. If you flip the display box over, it's empty. So, regardless of how interested I am about a movie, I can't learn anything off the back of the display box. I have no way of knowing if it's worth coming back for. You read me?   The counter service is okay. It's not horrible, but it's not the best I've ever had. I can handle status quo at a video store. Hey, it's a video store.   If you walk in expecting the average video store experience, you won't leave disappointed. But, you may just leave with a couple good movies you can recommend to me. Cool? Cool.

If you rue the typical college crowd - with self-loathing women and self-loathing (disguised as overly pompous and loud) men - then you need to avoid this place like it's the  next outbreak of SARs. No, it's worse than that. Picture a half-interested and slow bartender taking your order while you're stuck listening to the worse pretend hair band you've ever heard, covering some rock songs you forgot existed. Pour some sugar where?   Imagine the drinks making your stomach kick itself 1,700 times in a row, until you have to excuse yourself to go to the restroom, which is one of the smallest and most uncomfortable places you could be. I'd rather be stuffed in a trunk.   Imagine people clamboring to climb onto the bar so they can "dance" with the music, singing at the top of their lungs. Ow, that's my hand you just stepped on!  Yes, it gets worse. It's not like you can just leave, although you want to, don't you? I mean, you *just* ordered a drink after paying a silly $5 cover. So, you try to tough it out. But, let's face it, life's too short to be miserable. You can bail, if you want to. That's what I did.

There's not much more I can say about Rula that hasn't already been said. Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR.   Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though.   Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough.   If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.  It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.  WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS: Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!  Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!

I'm not a vegan. I've never eaten at a vegan restaurant, nor could I (at least right now) choose to be vegan 100%. Yet if anyone was ever going to convince me to go vegan, it'd be Green.  The sweet potato tator tots were delicious, as was my huge salad filled with fresh greens and figs.   I'm not a fan of soy (unless it's edamame), so I was happy to hear this place offers alternatives to soy-based fake meats and cheeses.   The decor is rad. The place is eco-friendly too.  The staff is friendly and helpful.   Yep, this place is pretty damn amazing.

Art. Ideas. Taste. Phx Culture.   I first saw this rag at The Roosevelt and knew immediately I needed to take it home with me. Not only that, I couldn't discard it once I looked through the articles and ads. It's fodder for me, for I often use different magazines and art pieces to jump-start my own creative thinking.   And since I can do it with this rag, I know Java is cool.  Plus, within its pages my interest was piqued about events and places around CenPho, including Carly's and Hidden House.   Could it be better? Sure. Of course. But you can pretty much say that about anything, even well-known mags like Wired, Desert Living, and Phx New Times.  Definitely worth perusing. The apperance may feel "garage produced," but I'd be surprised if you didn't read from front to back and not take away something new or cool.

I love to hate this place. And I hate to love it. It really boils down to that.   But, allow me to ramble on.   I've only been into this store a handful of times - not even enough to hold 10 fingers up. At first, I thought the vibe was cool, but then I realized that the clothing caters to a very young, modern crowd. That's fine, if you're into baby doll cardigans and skinny jeans. Initially I thought there was nothing I'd see (besides books and the oddities) that I'd want to buy. I stand corrected. My last visit I found that they offer simpler choices in t-shirts for people like me. Sure, there are still your trendy cuts and styles for those who can't live without imitating Paris Hilton or Jenny Lewis, but there are also plain colors and styles that you can mix-n-match to complement your own personal tastes. I like that about this place. I like that you can find 2 tees for $24 and 2 tanks for $20. Ain't bad.   I haven't dared to try on any pants or jeans... or shoes, for that matter. I figure I better stick with what I know - shirts. The last thing I need is to try and slip into their jeans and find that my birthin' hips aren't all the rage. I'd like to think there's more to this world than stick figures and skinny fat chicks. Oh, no offense to those with boyish figures. I just know that when I walk into Urban, the chances of me finding anything that a) I like and b) that fits is, oh, 23%. That's not to say I'm complaining. I accept that Urban caters to a younger crowd. That doesn't mean I can't mosey around once in a while hoping to be proven wrong.  On the other hand, I bet my Shirley Manson collection that my 14 year old sis would go wild in Urban. I wouldn't want to be the one fitting that bill.       (Sidebar: I own not a Shirley Manson collection, but that doesn't mean you can't try and dress like her - just go to Urban!)

This is as good as it gets for Phoenix Pho.   While they may be closed on Sundays and during the holidays (check ahead), you can satisfy your Pho craving here. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Service is incredible and fast. The prices are great and the serving sizes are HUGE.   Pho Nhat is Pho-tastic!

If Top's Liquor were a friend of mine, he'd have a serious Identity Crisis with Attention Deficient Disorder. All the more reason to adore him, right? After all, he'd be the life of the party!   When you walk into Tops, you see what can only be described as Sensory Overload. From boxes and boxes aligning the walls and stacked at the ends of the aisles to hanging paraphernalia, it's no wonder you get side-tracked so easily. What did I come here for?  Oh, right. Beer!   Having heard Top's sells Aquavit, a hard-to-come-by Swedish liquor, I had a feeling Top's would also carry some of my fave beer. Sure enough, although I'm sad to report they didn't have everything I was looking for. Where are you Hazelnut Brown? Where have you gone?   Apparently at Top's, you can pick and choose the beers you buy, for many of the 6-packs were half-full (or half-empty, if you're a pessimist). This intrigued and irked me, for I didn't want to BYO6P (Build Your Own 6 Pack) if I came with one thing in mind: 6 bottles of delicious Breckenridge, Rogue or other brewed delights. Then again, if I can hand-select my 6-pack, that's cool, too. (I just wasn't sure I could, and I was too shy to try.)   So I went with 3 bottles of beer: two Rogue I've never tried (American Amber and Moto Black) and one nut brown from Full Sail, an Oregon brewery.  The selection here is great! They even had a newly discovered Sundog Amber Wheat, as well as a new ale from Breckenridge I've never seen anywhere else. There's also plenty of Alaskan and many, many, many other breweries present - on the shelf or in the fridge. They even sell Peroni! (Haven't found that anywhere else.)  I wondered toward the East wall, passing by Belgian Ales and others that intrigued me. I've never seen anything like it. Top's has the biggest selection of corked beer I've ever seen.    I tossed a glance at the Wine selection and decided to come another time when I was in the mood for vino.   Upon checkout, I asked if they carried Rogue's Hazelnut Brown. The guy behind the counter went to look, grabbing a couple stacks of boxes and peering behind them at a whole 'nother stack of boxes. Guess they didn't have it, though he said they usually do. Hrm.   For 3 big bottles of beer, I paid a little over $15. Each beer was about $5, which is a great price!   I will DEFINITELY be back!  (Top's would've gotten a 5-star from me, IF they had had Rogue's Hazelnut Brown waiting for me. Shame on them...)  JUNE '08 UPDATE: So, Top's does carry the Hazelnut Brown. Yet, just as I have fallen in love with another Rogue beer - the black Moto Soba ale - I am having no luck finding it here, even though this is where I first bought it. Alas, I will resort to mixing-and-matching my 6-packs to explore other brews, like Full Sail and Lost Coast.

Very, very few things in life ever reach perfection.   House of Tricks, you are my lunch mecca!  Honestly, if I could eat here Monday through Friday for lunch, I would. And what would I order? Their daily quiche. Absolutely. No hesitations. No second thoughts.   Their quiche of the day is perfection!  I've eaten here twice in a single week. Yes, House of Tricks is simply that awesome. After my 1st visit, I was craving it the very next day. So I made plans to go back that very week. I wanted to try their quiche again.   House of Tricks is my absolute favorite lunch spot in Tempe!  For $10, you get their quiche of the day, fresh fruit and a soup or salad.   First quiche was chicken and goat cheese. Wow... That's all I could think to myself. "Wow, Alicia, this is... wow..."   Second trip I had sausage, mushrooms and Gruyere quiche, which I ordered with their daily soup, a lobster squash concoction. While the soup was really, really good, I was still enamored with their quiche.   And fresh fruit? C'mon. This is the stuff Lunch Nirvana is made of!  House of Tricks, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!   House of Tricks, I love you! I love your quiche! You deserve every single exclamation point in the exclamation point satchel. Seriously!  I would eat inside, outside, at the bar, wherever I could. Yes, I'd eat here every single day. That adds up to a $50 weekly habit... but I bet there's not one quiche I wouldn't like!

C'mon, it's deep dish Chicago-style pizza in Arizona. I'm not about to complain. Forgo the appetizers, unless you can eat alot of food.   My friend and I came here after our 5K run. I packed away three mouth-watering slices of their signature pizza. It was so worth it. If I could have eaten more, I would have.   Forget thin crust or flat bread. Thick crust pales in comparison. There's nothing else like deep dish, and I'm glad there's an easily accessible joint in my 'hood that I can go to when I need my fix.

A little too college for me - meaning, that I felt a bit out of place, even though I'm easygoing, like to showcase my tats and couldn't give a damn about pretensions and stereotypes. I had the hunch that 90-95% of the people there are students (or in that age range) and wondered if a conversation were to be ignited, would it go anywhere?   Casey's is too smokey, too. But, if you avoid it Thursday - Saturday, it's a cool place to go in the early afternoon. My best friend and I chilled out here one sunny afternoon. It was very relaxing. Yet, I soon saw that even at 5 p.m., the place starts to fill up quickly. So, if you don't mind noise and you like commotion, this is a sure bet. Also, if you like Guinness, Ace's or the mix of the two (yum), you'll get your fix.

Some people pop the cork on champagne when they're starting a new chapter in life. Some throw confetti. Some even become introspective and ponder the meaning of life. And others, I'm sure, just decide to get freaky with it.   As for me, I marched my determined, happy arse up to the front doors of SRP to turn on electricity in my new place. Having already spoken to somebody on the phone earlier that week, I was told I would have to stop in to show some ID. Annoying.   Yet, when I walked into the main office (tucked close to the Zoo and Firefighters Museum), I was relieved to be greeted by a young, friendly woman. She was soft spoken, which, in turn, made me soft spoken. She was polite, which, in turn, made me polite. Let's face it, nobody looks forward to dealing with companies that control your ability to blow dry your hair in the morning.   I flashed my ID, answered a couple questions and waited patiently while she went to fetch information about my plan - which included a free magnet. Nice!   It was almost so quick and painless that for a half-second I thought I had conjured the entire experience.   And, on a different note, kudos to SRP for their EarthWise Energy Program - an easy way to help improve the environment. Just $3 a month and you can contribute to solar projects. Also, with Trees for Change, you can also help plant trees in forests that were destroyed by fires.  I don't know about you, but I feel like just doing a little bit more for the environment makes it that much easier to sleep at night - not to mention run the dishwasher without feeling like your wasting entirely too much water/power.

Talk about annoying - the wait staff, especially. No, it's not the service. It's the gimmicky, corny and self-humiliating "dances" they perform for their customers every few minutes. I guess eating mediocre food in peace isn't good enough.   The disco, flashing lights come on. That's your warning. It's also a free headache, compliments of Joe's. Then, there's clapping, hooraying, twisting, turning to music like the Village People. Absurd.   The food isn't that much better, either. Instead of a headache, you get to walk away with an upset stomach. Maybe it's the combo. Smile and nod. "Yes, I'd like to order the Bucket of Shrimp with the I Want to Puke Music and Dancing."   So, why 2 stars? Beer. It's about beer - all about beer. Since it's Oct, everyone and their mother has a special pumpkin ale available. The one in the pic on the menu looked like the perfect mix to wash down bad service and even badder (yes, i said it) food. The waitress recommended Sam Adam's Oktoberfest instead. She brought me two huge samples of each... they probably both, together, made up a 1/2 pint! I was buzzed before I placed my order!   She was right, though. Sam Adam's is what to order.   I picked at my crab-stuffed shrimp, polished off the steamed veggies and washed the rice down with Oktoberfest that, almost, made the entire experience worth it.   What i wouldn't give right now for another pint of Oktoberfest. (But I'll be damned if I'm going back to Joe's to get it.)

Imagine this: You're stuck in a 2.5 hour training session - your attention supposedly riveted to the projector screen so you can learn about the new management system your department is implementing. Sounds, fascinating, right? Of course it does.   If that wasn't fun enough, your lunch is catered and costs nothing. That alone will get most people to a meeting. On top of that, a menu circulated the week prior and you were able to personally select your lunch of choice. Right on.   I chose the Club Sandwich. Yep, that's right. Turkey, ham, bacon, cheese AND cranberry sauce on the side (to happily smear on my bread later for a festive treat). For my side, frog eye salad. Having no idea what this was when I saw it on the menu, I immediately went to Google to find out. Sounded good to me, so I opted to try it. Turns out it's a sweet concoction with tapioca, mandarin oranges and marshmallows (usually).   My lunch arrived in a little box with a clearly marked label on the top. Inside I found my sandwich neatly wrapped, the salad side sealed in a little container, standard plastic-ware with a single napkin, a pickle and tomato on the side, one cookie and a chocolate mint. (Not to mention packaged condiments like mayo and mustard.)  This is one of the best free sandwiched I've ever had, esp. with the cranberry sauce adding a great sweet balance to the meats and cheeses. Strangely enough, the size of this sandwich was reasonable, although it wasn't a standard sandwich size - not like the other sandwiches people ordered that were sliced in half. The Club is like a 3/4 of a sandwich, although the stuffings between the bread make it more than able to satiate a big appetite. Every bite of The Club was better than the last. The frog eye salad was tasty, too. The cookie was okay. At least it was soft and chewy. And chocolate (yes!).   I really, really liked my lunch. I can tell that my work mates likes theirs, too, for everyone happily gobbled up their lunches super fast. I think I was the last to finish - if that tells ya anything. I guess I wanted to not only sink my teeth into a hearty sandwich but also take the time to savor it.   5 Stars for Apple Spice Junction! It's the best sandwich catering service I've had. Seriously.

Skateboards as art, hanging on the walls. That's where my eyes landed first upon entry. Then I noticed the tables. Finally, the menu, including the tempting pies and sugary treats taunting me from the counter.   There was a short line but the pace was quick. I ordered a simple iced coffee with room (for cream). Cost was $2.50. It's all the cash I had on me at the time. Kismet. The  plastic cup, with a crooked Lux sticker, came nearly full. I braced for the staunch coffee jolt when sipping it down below the brim. But, to my surprise, no such jolt happened. Without cream, this iced coffee was great. That's all I needed to rate this place 4 stars. Seriously. Most coffees you have to "dumb down" to taste. Not here. So, I added cream and a couple of packs of organic sugar. I mixed. I grabbed a bright orange straw and managed to spill my coffee when trying to insert the straw into the lid. Oh joy. A handful of napkins later, I was good to go.   I parked myself outside under the canopy at one of their wooden tables. I sipped slowly, enjoying reprieve from the still-hot-in-November Phoenix sun. I enjoyed relaxing here, watching people come and go, watching the people inside work on their laptops. This is definitely a great place to hang out, to get some work done and to catch up with friends. I'll be back, especially now that I know the coffee is fantastic and it's within a short walk from my abode.   Praise Allah for Lux!

Still love the coffee.   For the first time ever, I order my coffee and something sweet - for there. While in line, I eyed the sweets. I wasn't the only one, though. A little fly was having his fair share of sugar, flying from scone to muffin to cake. My heart dropped. Luckily, they had a few choices covered up in glass. I chose the massive, super-chocolate walnut brownie.   Somehow, miraculously, I managed to carry two plates to the "coffee condiment station." I set the brownie down gingerly on the napkins. Then I balanced the coffee cup and saucer in my left hand.... while pouring cream slowly into the cup with my right. I made it almost to the door, when I decided to set the brownie plate down and sip the coffee below the rim - before it sloshed all over the place. It was a suspenseful, long walk and I didn't have a clue how I was going to turn the door handle and make it outside. I stepped aside and asked the people behind me to give me a hand. I don't think they heard me, but they held the door open long enough for me to slip outside... and into a wooden bench directly under the noon-hour sun. Wowza.   Since it's always so hard to find a spot inside, I opted for out. My brownie began to melt. The hot coffee tasted great, but it did little to save me from the heat and the sweat beginning to collect down my spine.   Needless to say, I tossed the coffee back like it was a cheap shot at a club, stuffed my brownie in the to-go bag I requested and practically jogged to my car, where I blasted the A/C and drove away.  Upside of all this? I sliced my brownie into small pieces and shared it with my co-workers, who have not yet been to Lux, although I keep telling them to go... Looks like I brought Lux to them.

Swanky! Snazzy! Stylish!   Oh my.   I stayed at the Mondrian once - last June (2006). The room was impeccable. The decor, the modern furniture, the color palette were all pleasing to me. Plus, I made sure they had a CD player in the room (bonus!). Check-in was a breeze, as was finding the room.   We ate dinner at the hotel, which, evidently, has been remodeled. I took a look-see the other weekend and did not like what I saw. All white. White. White. White. Everywhere, except the new bar (also renovated, which I also don't like) which boasts of devilish red. Quite ironic, it's decorated with cherubs... and plastic-looking stuff. Not my bag.   The old Mondrian, the one I hold so fondly in my memories, deserves a 5-star rating. This new hotel only gets 4, and that's generous because I'm still writing this based on a year-ago memory and not on a recent experience.   On a side note: Apparently the pool is the hottest place to be on a weekend. But don't plan to swim. This is where, if you're beautiful enough, you'll get to be beautiful with other beautiful people. Just don't expect any Manson to be playing. Instead, expect some typical rap-ish tunes to be blasting from the speakers. Again, not my bag.   But, dammit, if the rooms are still as stylish as I remember, I love this place.

As far as malls go - and I hate malls - this one is tolerable. Just speed past the food court to avoid a cluster you-know-what.   If you like upscale, this is your place. Me, I typically hit two to three stores and leave. But maybe that's just my shopping style.  If you have the cash to blow, the time to spend and the desire to shop, then this is your mall.

What a joke! Whoever recommended this place for happy hour must be smokin' some serious crack. $6 for spinach artichoke dip. Guess what? It's the same price on the regular menu! The other choices are only $1 off and are mostly fried options. Lame.   I was tempted to order the strawberry salad with feta. But for $9? I can certainly make that at home! I was tempted to try the kobe burger with blue cheese and apples. But my waistline didn't need it. Nor could I talk myself into spending $12 on a piece of meat slapped between two buns. No way.   As for the beer, uhm... Excuse me while I roll my eyes. You won't find any taps here. That's because they serve only bottles. And not many of them, apparently. Best you'll find here is a Heineken. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I went with the Calorie Counter's swill-water known as Michelob Ultra. It was $2 during HH. I had to force myself to drink it.   Instead of stay and endure the wrecked atmosphere and abysmal beer selection, my pal and I opted to pay for our drinks and go somewhere else. Somewhere far better.   What a waste of time!  That's it. This place is now officially re-named. Which do you prefer? Vote now with your cell phone keypad.   Press 1 for Bunga-no-no.  2 for Bunga-noway.  3 for Bungaloser. 4 for Bungalame.

Oh, Tia Rosa... how you surprise me. With your festive decorations for the holidays, your loquacious patrons sitting nearly side-by-side, your relatively tiny bar area, large and crowded patio and absurdly long wait lines on weekends, I am befuddled as to how I can like you.   But, no matter how many chips I must munch on before shown to a table, no matter how embarrassingly small your beer selection is (although you do have Dos Equis and Fat Tire), and no matter how I may sometimes be randomly serenaded by your boys with guitars, none of this matters when I peek inside your menu (or even slowly sip a 'rita). I cease to concern myself with trivial matters, like beer selection and wait time. Your menu is vast, proffering fresh fish, including halibut and salmon, as well as a new flair on traditional fare, like the Chicken Mole enchiladas, which I devoured with gusto.  This is a fun place, extremely family-friendly, good for large groups or when you're with a friend or significant other and you're just craving Mexican food without the fire, the typical beans/rice sides and the standard after-dinner heartburn. On weekends, parking can be quite the headache. So, either arrive early or forgo your plans for a week night.   Bottom line: Tia Rosa's is a must.

I CONQUERED CAMELBACK MOUNTAIN!  Never in my life would I have thought it possible for me to climb up a mountain. Not just any mountain, though. Camelback is said to be one of the toughest to climb (within city limits), especially if you climb the side without the railing, which I did.   It's so hard to believe it's been over a year since I grunted, moaned, laughed and forced myself up to the top. What a view! (Be careful if you're scared of heights, like me, cuz there's really nothing protecting you at the top and the wind gets gusty!)   My climbing companion was more a pro than I expected. When he said, "Let's go hiking," I thought about my leisure experience at South Mountain. Uhm, I was wrong. About 3/4 of the way up, he instructed me of the 3-point method: having 3 points of contact with the mountain at all times. Good to know. At that point, instinct had already kicked in and I was clinging to the side of the mountain like a fly clings to the windshield of a speeding car.   It's can be quite scary to glance down and know that if your foot slipped...   Be careful of the super-charged buff boys running up and down the mountain in nothing but athletic shorts and shoes. I think I got passed several times by the same dude. Also, there may be dogs climbing too. I don't know how you can bring a golden retriever to the summit - let alone a toy dog - but I saw it with my own eyes!   On the way down, I passed by two guys in pastel polyester suits and sweat bands. I sh*t you not. When I turned to see if my eyes had deceived me (post-climb hallucination?), I was confirmed and even more amused, since the entire canvas of their backs were soaked with seat, thanks to the oh-so-breathable poly suit jacket. My guess is these guys were a) crazy b) hung-over c) suicidal or d) all of the above.  So, yeah. Going up was hard. Coming down was hard. Going up and coming down were scary. My feet slipped alot, damn tennis shoes w/ horrible friction. Good thing I'm a pro at catching my balance!  Climbing this mountain will never be a hobby of mine. I like to keep my feet on solid ground. But, alas, I climbed the mountain on my own, all the way up to the top! How is cool is that?  When I reached the bottom safely, I did what can only be called a "happy dance," waving my arms, kicking my feet and shouting, "I conquered Camelback Mountain! I conquered Camelback Mountain!"

I've only had Gelato once.  That was last month. I had it here, at Gelato Spot - cozied up next to a fave sushi joint.   I was selfish. I had like 6 samples before I could decide. There was alot of pressure to please myself this day, on the day I had my first-ever Gelato experience. A friend recommended the chocolate and peanut butter mixed in a shake. Instead, I went simple: one scoop of pistachio. It was remarkable - the perfect blend of sweet with nutty goodness. My friend savored the tiramisui, also an excellent choice if your Sweet Tolerance is higher than average.   I'd definitely go back to this place, although I believe my selection of treats is smaller than the average person since I can't really stand a full-throttle sugar rush that many of the flavors proffer.   But, hey, I'm good with the pistachio, thanks.

Routine. Rut. Tried-and-true. Ever know somebody who liked to stick with what was familiar? Yeah, those people are my family. So imagine my nervousness when I suggested we dine here on a Saturday afternoon. They obliged. What great sports.   I love the atmosphere of FEZ. Even at 12:30 on a weekend, this place seems to be an it-spot. Elton John was playing, that much I remember. (Can't go wrong there, in my opinion.)  I also recall being intrigued by their weekend brunch (both Saturday and Sunday, until 2 p.m.). Awesome. My lil bro ordered his first mimosa and drank it happily with two twisty-straws. He ordered the breakfast panini and LOVED.EVERY.SINGLE.BITE.  My dad ordered the All American burger with the harissa fries. Those fries were an instant hit, a crowd pleaser. My dad said the food at FEZ is a "flavor explosion." He couldn't have been happier. I ordered the FEZ salad with lamb, and was really pleased. It was hearty enough to fill me up without my feeling guilty.   We also tried the sweet potato fries (an instant hit with my brother, who loved them beyond belief) and the hummus platter. I have been trying to get my Dad to try hummus for 2.5 years... and finally he did. Did he like it? Yeah, he sure did! We all nibbled happily on the pita bread and fries, talking about how this was some of the best food we all have ever had.   What really made our experience so great was Thomas S. Lucky for us, he was working that day and came out to say hi. It was great to finally meet him. He's super friendly and funny. And he treated my family so well! For that, I will always be grateful. There's nothing like seeing happy, smiling faces on the people you love the most, is there? Especially when they have decided to try something new, something they may consider "daring" and fall fastly in love with the flavor combinations, the service, the vibe and the selections.   My Dad said that if he lived nearby, he'd be coming here all the time. Thomas cleverly said, "I'll get you the name of a Realtor." We all laughed.   On the way out to the vehicle, my breother remarked, "Even the mints are awesome!"   Yep, FEZ is awesome. From burgers and salads to beer and brunch, this place has got something for everyone. Even those hard-to-please or stuck-in-their-ways people we all know and love.

4 stars. That's atypical for a place in Scottsdale, or so I like to think. However, there's something quite charming about this place... Perhaps it's the witty ads you see in the New Times, or the fact that they know their style and their brand and they enforce it well through advertising. But, let's face it, you don't want to hear about that.   So, what about the food? Sushi is good! If memory serves, it's on a higher caliber than most other places you'll find in the area, especially Ra. Try the quail egg shooter. That's fun!    Service is good, considering its location and how crowded the place can get. Music is loud, though. So be prepared to eat your meal with the accompaniment of a concert/rave... which means either yelling at your companion(s) or settling for conversational silence.   The decor is trendy. That's neither good or bad, if you ask me. But, considering again the restaurant's location, the decor (the colors, the layout, the patio) just fit. It works. I like that, too.   All in all, I like this place. It kind of hurts me to say that, due to its location, but if you're looking for a fun, trendy place to hang with friends in Scottsdale (and have a pretty good sushi meal), then go here. I don't think you'll leave disappointed; you just may leave deaf.

For what you're going to find in Phoenix or Scottsdale or Tempe, this place gets top billing in my book. I've been twice. Once when I first moved here. My first experience was good, yet I found the prices to be a tad too steep for regular visits. Plus, it was a weekend night and the crowd/music was too loud for me.   So, imagine my surprise when my friend and I stopped in here on a regular weekday for happy hour! We were seated in the sushi bar area at a table with comfy chairs. I absolutely love the interior decor. Very relaxing.   The service was some of the best I've had anywhere, hands down. Jenni, who waited on us, was spectacular. I recommend you ask for her section, when you go.   I love how they serve you warm towels for your hands. Now that's classy. Plus, it just feels so good, even during the summer.   So, let's break down Happy Hour: $1.50 for sake. Yum. $2 for salmon nigiri. $2 for quail egg shooters. $4 for futomaki roll.   There are many great options on the happy hour menu, including $2 edamama and $3 draft kirin. My friend and I opted to split the Sashimi Sampler Boat (for $20). It came with 3 pieces of different fish: octopus, albacore, salmon, yellowtail and tuna. DELICIOUS! And the pieces of fish were bigger than most sushi joints.  When I asked for low sodium soy, I was told that's what's always on the table. I shoulda known; it's Scottsdale, right? I was also told the fish comes in fresh daily. It sure tasted fresh. Even my sushi-smart friend commented on the quality of fish. Plus, we each got two yummy gummy treats with our receipt. Very nice! (Those little things are so addicting!)  What a great happy hour! With the service being excellent and the atmosphere being super chill and relaxed, I will definitely be back for another 'round of happy hour fun. You just may not see me here on the weekends - too loud and too crowded.

Based on memory and a one-time visit, I'm giving this place 4 stars. That's pretty damn fine, if you consider how it's been nearly 365 complete days since my first and only "run in" with Rosie.   All the way around, it was a nice experience. Sure, it was a Saturday night and the bar was crowded when my friend and I got there. So, we took ourselves upstairs and out onto the patio. Great vantage point, if you can tolerate smoking. I really like the interior of the place - almost feels like a basement with an escape hatch through the roof. Don't ask me why it makes me think of this. It could just be me...  I used to drive past Rosie's on a regular basis and think, "I need to go there again." I never have made it back, but that isn't any fault of the establishment. Rosie's is a great pick for when you're in Central Phoenix. Definitely check it out. You'll probably leave with a great impression, like I did. Only I hope you're not as absentminded as I am to never make it back there for a second round.

Carly's, you are my new favorite place in Central Phoenix.   Even after reading the less-than-stellar reviews, I decided to take my brother here before touring the surrounding blocks, stopping at The Lost Leaf and nextDOOR. Good idea, cuz I was hungry!   The inside is very cool. I love the bar area, the comfortable feel, the hand-drawn art on some of the tables. Even better, the service was top-notch. Not only did we get one person to wait on us, but we got two! My water never went dry. After perusing the variety of beers, I decided to save myself for, let's face it, my favorite art bar, The Lost Leaf. Yet, I was DEFINITELY tempted to try something new, like the Red Chimay or what was referred to as "the Czech Bud Light." Everyone loves a lager, right? Well, that description turned me off. But, fret not, they do have Stella on tap for $3 (for 12 oz). I definitely want to come here during happy hour - 5 to 7 p.m.   Oh, as for the food, DELICIOUS! Our friendly Aussie waiter wasn't shy when I asked him what his favorites were. Turns out, we decided to order his two faves, the Prosciutto and Cuban sandwiches. With the chips, please. We didn't wait long for our food. I was delighted to see how colorful the chips were - one even looking like a dried rose petal. My brother and I both agreed: these chips were damn fine! So was our sandwiches. My Prosciutto sandwich came with a fig paste spread on Napolitano bread. Then there was the tasty meat and cheese (Gorgonzola).   I SAVORED.EVERY.SINGLE.BITE.   I even saved one of the chips for last, since they were such a tasty find. I wanted to ask for me, yet I told myself not to be gluttonous.   I really can't wait to go back. The Prosciutto sandwich was so divine, I'm not sure I can try anything else, although I really wish I could. The Caprese and Smoked Salmon sandwiches both sound incredible.   Damn. I'm craving Carly's now. I'm so excited I found a place like Carly's that's just a short drive away!   Gonna need to go soon! I recommend you go, too.

I must've ordered the wrong thing. Dangit. And I was so excited to try this place, too. I wanted to be bad and order the grilled cheese. But, I went with a salad. It's the Gruyere cheese that got me. I had to have it. Little did I realize that the lettuce they used would be your standard, boring iceburg. Ick. But, I did appreciate the combination of other flavors, and the thing was massive (took half with me for later).   But, since eating at ZuZu, I've decided that if you go out as a treat, don't order a salad. Order something that's going to atleast have a high start value, like the blue cheese fondue.   Anyway... Have you ever had a roll so good that you thought it was laced with some addictive illegal substance? Uh, yeah. Cafe ZuZu's rolls are UN-believable. Too bad my request for seconds went unheard. I would have even paid for 'em. Words can't capture how tasty these rolls were - warm, fresh from the oven, fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.   Service was anything but stellar. Our server tried, I'll give her that. But she seemed a bit scattered. Good thing Paul, the host (and/or manager, not sure) came by to see how everything was... and to confess that, yes, even he is addicted to the rolls.   Will I be back? Doubtful. I hate to valet park, and it's mandatory at Valley Ho. It's complimentary, of course, if you eat at ZuZu, but even then, you have to factor in a good tip on top of another good tip on top of the price for lunch... Seems like alot of effort, doesn't it? It'd be one thing if the food were worth it, but, like I said, I think I ordered the wrong thing. Even my lunch buddy, who had a green chile burger, said the food was just okay.   Cafe ZuZu, you get Cool Kid Points for trying, but I'm docking points off for poor execution.

My birthday cake came from Tammie Coe and it was AMAZING.   It was beautiful decorated with amazing frosting. But it was the inside that won me over. Gooey, decadent chocolate, oh my! It was so rich, I ate half a slice... but it was oh so worth it!

Two words: Delicious Delicious.   This is the perfecto Sunday brunch spot. I haven't been any other time, so this is from whence my rating comes.   I've had the French Dip, Chicken Salad and triple meat pizza. All three were scrumptious. Not at all once, mind you.   Sit outside, if you can. Dine slowly, enjoying the day. Watch the trolley past by. Look around - it doesn't look like Phoenix. On Sundays, it's almost a ghost town in that part of Scottsdale. Even better. If you feel like walking, go for it. There are plenty of shops in the area (including this amazing tea store) to venture to.   I love taking all my visitors to this place. Not only do they get to glimpse Old Town, but they also get to drink Sangria or Mimosas while having an utterly satisfying brunch.

Interior is something to behold, but it's not impressive enough to keep one coming back. So, what about the drinks? Sangria is okay; margaritas aren't anything to write home about.   So, what does this place offer? It's certainly not the grub. The salsa tastes like burnt rubber. The namesake dish (pink taco) is a mess on a plate. If you want to go to say you went - to say you had the pink taco - then go, but don't say I didn't warn ya.   This place epitomizes all that's wrong in the world, or atleast what's defunct about Scottsdale. Flashy baubles, boobie bouncin' women, marked up mediocrity and the air of popularity that's so desired, service and quality are jeopardized.   Uhm, no thanks.

Fantastic to find a theatre that plays non-mainstream movies stuffed with car chases, gun slingers and curse words. Better than that, this theatre caters to the independent and more artistically unique movies.   I saw The Namesake here, as well as Paris J'Taime. This was also the only theatre in the Valley (that I knew of) that played the smash hit Thank You For Smoking.   Thank You, Harkins, for Camelview 5. And thank you, Phoenix moviegoers with steller taste, for patronizing this establishment.

UPDATE:  If you want to go enjoy this place, be advised that 8 o'clock on a Saturday comes with about an hour wait. The place is a-hoppin'! They have comfy seats for your wait, though. I had two more magnificent mojitos, as well as the tortilla soup and grilled peach salad. The latter should be illegal it's so good. I blame the goat cheese.   * * *   Best waffle fries on the planet. Hands down.   Best Ginger Lemon Mojito ever poured. Hands down.   Best Happy Hour prices in Phoenix. Hands down.   I mean, can you really resist $3.50 Mojitos and Margaritas? I didn't think so.   The decor is inviting, very trendy (in a not-trying-too-hard way) with vibrant reds. There's a TV over the bar, for those who can't get enough sports updates. There's an outside patio, too.   The Resto-Bar is called just that, for it's divided. You walk in - to your left is the bar/patio areas. To your right is the dining area.   The menu is loaded with delectable entrees, salads and appetizers. It would be difficult to decide what to get. The best thing is to take a group of friends and sample each other's.   The staff behind the bar are very nice... and easy on the eyes, of course. But I'm not complaining.   Did I mention their fabulous waffle fries? My mouth is watering just thinking about them...   I need to go back. Pronto.   Ticoz is the type of place - with their drinks, savory dishes and prices - that you'll crave.   This is my new fave Phoenix discovery. Hands down.

Mojitos Monday and an awesome happy hour = nice!   I love the atmosphere and decor of the bar. Love the down tempo music. Even the outdoor patio looks awesome.   The mojitos are still the best I've ever had. They've changed up their menu slightly. There are plenty of flavored mojitos to try, including blackberry and mango. They nixed the Ginger Lemon martini, though, so when I asked for a Ginger Lemon mojito (a made-to-order drink I had the last time I came here), I was happy that the bartender obliged. The server seemed a tad put-off by my request. I might have irked him a bit, but I had to try the Ginger Lemon mojito to see if it was as good as I remember. It was probably the last one I'll ever had... so it was a bittersweet moment for me. My 2nd mojito was the mango one. It was tasty, but I think I prefer the more traditional (less sweet) drinks.   My HH pal and I ordered the two burgers for $5. They are 1/4 lb burgers and come about medium well. Mine was super salty but tasty. We also ordered a basket of their waffle fries. Damn good! Plus, with the complimentary chips and a trio of salsa, my friend and I both agreed: we felt super stuffed afterwards.   The good news? The bill was only $17 for 3 mojitos, two burgers and an order of fries. Nice!   Ticoz, I'm still a huge fan of yours!

I would rate this place a 5, but it gets pretty noisy. It was difficult to hold a conversation with my date. But, when my entree was served, I no longer cared. I ordered the slow-roasted maple duck (or something like that) and every bite was more and more delicious (dare I say orgasmic?). I savored that bird, piece by piece. My date had the ahi tuna. It was good, but it didn't compare to the duck - which was the first time I had ever tried such an entree - sprinkled with fresh peppercorns!  I'd like to go back soon. I've had duck other places, but it just doesn't compare. Would I order anything else if I went? Probably not. The duck was JUST that spectacular.

As an outdoor venue, 5 stars. What more can you ask for? The amphitheater style seating allows for you to get a pretty good vantage point, no matter where you are on the hill. Plus, if you want to do your sardine moshing, you can - front and center with other sweaty fans.   I've seen a couple shows here. The first was Dashboard Confessional when Ben Lee opened for them. It was a terrific show. Dashboard had plenty of visual accompaniment to keep me riveted. Plus, they pulled onstage the up-and-comer John Ralston. I had a hunch there would be a special guest. I was right.   The opener, Ben Lee, was incredible, too. He played to the crowd like musicians should. After his show, he even manned the memorabilia table, signing autographs and chatting with fans. I thought that was cool. You don't see that every day.   Of course, this shouldn't be a review of the bands. Shame on me.  So, about the venue...Well, I have nothing but positive things to say about Mesa Amp. Buying tickets is a cinch. You pick 'em up at Will Call. Sure, there's a quick pat-down search, but it's nothing you won't find at the Marquee. They let ya bring in a bottle of water, as long as you throw away the cap. The girls bathroom is big and clean, considering it's an outdoor venue. There's a couple concession stands that offer bottled water, soda and beer. I don't know what they have on tap. I never ordered at the shows I went to. I'll be sure to do so next time and report back.   The first concert I sat through on a grassy patch. It was very cool to see a show at dusk and feel the air grow cooler as the sun tucked itself underneath the fold of the skyline.   The most recent show was at night. While I will probably never see Modest Mouse again live (seen them twice; both times was disappointed), I can say that the acoustics at Mesa Amp do not disappoint. The crowd was rowdy but respectful. I never once felt uncomfortable, even though I went by myself. There was a friendly vibe to the crowd. I liked that.  As far as parking goes, if you get there early enough, you can find a spot in the private lot. Or you can find a spot on the street. I parked around back off the street near the hotel. Or, worse case scenario, you park in downtown Mesa and hoof it. It's not like it's going to be a treacherous hike or anything. C'mon, it's Mesa.  As for other events, Mesa Amp is surprising broadening the horizons and hosting a Blues Fest next year, as well as the 8th Annual Strong Beer Fest in February - just in time for my birthday.   I can see the new slogan now: "Mesa Amphitheater: It's not just a concert venue anymore."

I'm taking back a single star for a couple reasons:  *A 20oz bottle of water will cost ya $3.50.   If they're going to have shows in the summer, they shouldn't rip people off. National music festivals, like Lollapalooza and ACL, charge only $2.   *Crappy beer selection.   Ok, so if you're gonna drink, you might as well brace yourself to swallow swill. Best option they got, which can potentially hit the spot, is Amberbock.   Here are a few tips for ya: *Freeze a bottle of water for at least 6 hours. Pull it out an hour before the show and it should last ya all night, since it melts slowly.  *Wear as little as possible. Think shorts, tanks, flip flops.  *Bring cash. They have an ATM inside, but the lines seem to be longer for the cash-machine than the beer. Must be the tweeners looking to buy their concert tee.  *Stock up on albuterol. If you have smoke allergies or asthma, be careful where you sit. Everyone here lights up.  In closing, Mesa Amp still gets props for bringing in Rogue Wave and Death Cab for Cutie.

Unpretentious. Friendly. Inviting. Warm decor and soothing music. This is the first local coffee house I found when i moved here a year ago. It was an oasis, a hidden gem in a shopping plaza. My only complaint is that there's nothing else around worth doing, so you can't grab an ice chai (my favorite; with 1 shot espresso), a conversation and hit the road. You either have you chill in one of their comfortable chairs or sit outside on the make-shift patio. Works for me, unless you get antsy.   Bonus - Free Wifi. And the people there are no way obnoxious. No loud conversations or annoying cell phone calls.   If you like tea, you can buy some here. They boast a wide selection that even the most decisive tea drinker may have trouble deciding!  MONKS BLEND = Oh so good!  I only wish it were closer to my work/home.  And for you carb lovers, try the Pumpkin Muffin. It's fantastic!

Won't knock your pantaloons off, but it probably won't disappoint either. Snuggled up next to a pizza place, a sub shop and a coffee-addict's dream, Moe's offers you options - from quesidillas and tacos to salads and their infamous monster-size burritos.    Last time I went, I had one Overachiever taco. My total was barely $3. If you are a hungry hippo, you may need two. All orders come with a helping of crunchy chips and access to the salsa bar. Oh, and if you need a tasty beverage, you have the option of the soda fountain or bottled water, seltzer and Mexican beer.   The place is pretty clean with plenty of seating. I like that you can hop on a stool at the window and watch the outside world. The staff is friendly - mandatory greeting everyone with "Welcome to Moe's!"   If you're a fan of Mexican food, try Moe's. I've had their burrito, quesillda and soft-shell taco. Each and every time I've eaten here, I've left satisfied with plenty of reason to go back again.

Another disgustingly huge outdoor mall, complete with jacked-up traffic flow and crazy shoppers.   Been here 3 or 4 times. It's such a freakin' long drive for me and offers pretty much what you can find in Tempe Marketplace, Mesa Riverview and all other Mega Retail Mini-Cities.   If you live in the area, hooray for you. You have a one-stop shopping mecca. If you aren't in the area, don't bother with the drive. It's a mall. Outside. Crawling with people sweating profusely underneath the Phoenix sky.

UPDATE: I've been here two times now for brunch. Please, do yourself a favor, and try their yogurt with fresh fruit. It's incredible! I will definitely have to go back one of these evenings for a dinner dining experience. I want to try the wine!  * * *  Is there anything better than brunch? No, sometimes there just isn't. Of course, on the day I went to O&I, it was drizzly and overcast outside. That was an added touch.   Let's face it, everyone likes brunch. I mean, what's not to like? Special menus. The green light to drink before noon. The casual comfort of not having to cook either breakfast or lunch for yourself. Yep, brunch is great.   And brunch at Olive & Ivy is great, too. I ordered the pork hash. It didn't come quite as I imagined, but it was good nonetheless. (I heard it was fantastic the morning after on a bagel.) The O&I coffee was great and was served with fresh cream. Our server was friendly, attentive and accommodating. He didn't seem to mind that we were taking our time ordering and then decided to follow-up brunch with something sweet. I got the pumpkin gelato; my companion got the pear sorbet. Let me tell you, both were fantastic. I don't know what it is, but there's something absolutely wonderful about pumpkin anything - nevermind gelato served in a chilled bowl. It was the perfect way to balance and end brunch.   As for the decor, I love it. I love the high-back booths with their red and gold markings. I love the wood floors, huge doors, high ceilings and touch of elegance in their lighting (there's a breathtaking chandelier in one of their private rooms).   Having glanced at the wine menu, I definitely want to go back to enjoy perhaps a dinner entree. If not, to just relax with a couple of glasses of wine and the right company.

I had lunch here and it was fantastic. Having never been on a  weekday (since I usually go for their Sunday brunch) I was very surprised to see how large of a menu they offer. So many choices...  I went with the Ahi Tuna. It was under the salad menu, but it really wasn't a salad. Three pieces of delicious tuna were seared and then drizzled with a soy dressing. On the side was a shaved veggie salad, also good, that came with mushrooms mixed in.   Surprisingly, this was very filling. I had two cups of their Victrola coffee (a new fave) and left very, very, very happy - with the food, the service, the atmosphere... It's just great here!   Sure, I paid a little too much for lunch, if you ask me. $15 for my salad, but it was one of the most pricey items on the menu. (What can I say? I couldn't help myself). I paid about $2.50 for coffee with fresh cream. Mmmm. Love the fresh cream. Love the coffee!   Speaking of love, you can buy their pesto in their market area. It goes for $1 an oz, so be aware of that. Also in that area you can buy single beers. I'm not sure if you have to drink them there, with your food, or if you can bag it up and go. Hmm. Will have to check that out the next time I go. I did discover that the service on the market side of things is very lacking. It's a good thing they have the restaurant side. I absolutely love going here!

I was invited here recently for an event. Having never been, I was excited, especially since they feature local AZ wines.   While there, I had a fantastic time. Paris James, their musician that night, was outstanding. I'd listen to him play every day for the rest of my life.   However, when I left and headed home, everything turned from great to oh-my-god-i-want-to-die agony.   So, I will sum up this review with two words: FOOD POISONING!

What to say? It's easy to find, right off the 60 on the West side of Val Vista. There's plenty of parking. The restaurant/pub is huge - plenty of dining tables if you're looking for grub. I went during HH. I was looking for beer. My friend and I walked past the bar to grab a pub table - close to the restrooms and where they set up the band on Fridays.   We ordered our drinks quickly and then scanned the menu for anything that might strike our fancy. There was plenty to choose from, and it all sounded great. What to nibble on? We went with the fondue appetizer - you can't go wrong with a freshly baked pretzel, sliced apple (two different kinds) and gooey cheese greatness. It hit the spot, along with our brews.   The bar seemed a bit sparse for the hour of the day. It didn't really pick up that much either, not even as the band began to play at 9:30. The band was a mix of Irish and Blues. I say that because they opened with upbeat, fun Irish tunes and segued into some Blues. I think I preferred the Blues renditions. The band was nothing to look at, of course - middle aged men with thinning hair. But they worked as background music.   Molly's is a fun place. It doesn't have that cozy, quaint feeling of being in a hard-to-find, you're-a-special-patron establishment. Instead, it feels like the TGIFriday's of Irish restaurants. Don't get me wrong - the decor is nice... hardwood floors, interesting things on the wall, a restaurant slogan that makes ya chuckle. I just much prefer a swankier place.   So, why 4 stars? Probably was the company, the conversation we had in a place that was relaxed, friendly and serving us both some damn fine beer. (Guinness anyone?) Plus, our nibbling plate of caloric wonderfulness was a treat. Who knew fondue at an Irish bar was going to be any good? I certainly didn't. Oh, and the music was fun. I suggest checking out their website to see which bands are playing, for they seem to invite a large mix of musicians - Something for everyone, I guess.   So, if you're looking for an easy, simple and middle-of-the-road Irish pub experience, Molly's is your place.        Disclaimer: Review based on one experience.

Driving south on 3rd street at night is one thing. Driving down 3rd while you're trying to find The Roosevelt is another. Knowing sort-of where it was, I knew the appropriate time to slooooow down and glance left, glance right. Ah, there it was. No, there was no shimmering beacon, no flashy red "Open" or "Cool Peeps Only" signs to give itself away. There wasn't even lettering announcing I had found the place. None that I saw, I mean.   So imagine my mental surprise when I drive past and my car immediately careens towards an open parking spot. "There it is," I exclaim to myself. I had no solid proof. No curb address confirming Google maps. I had only my hunch, and the fact that the face of my friend was standing outside waiting for me to arrive.   It was about 9:15 when I hopped out of my car and walked up Roosevelt's sidewalk to the main entrance. I heard such great things about this place, I just had to see for myself.   Once inside, I noticed the absence of lighting. That's ok. I like my bars and hang outs to be dark (and sometimes dingy). The Roosevelt isn't dingy, though, even though it's in an old house. Instead, it's inviting, warm and gives off the impression of being intimate - like you're among friends you've never shared a sentence with. Imagine that. So, at first, I'm stoked. Sure, the place is cramped and even shortly after 9 p.m., there are no seats. Bummer. But, people around me are chitchattering and carrying on - so their positive energy makes this place even more inviting to me. So, we decide to stay, park ourselves by bar. Just as my friend and I make up our minds on what to order, a waitress comes over to assist us. She's extremely helpful and I end up savoring their Hazelnut Brown on tap. Delightful.  As time passes, more people - all who seem dressed up to dine at Phoenix's fanciest restaurant - walk in. Women in high heels. Men in dress shirts. And here I am in jeans and a thermal long-sleeve tee. My friend says, "I don't think we're cool enough for this place." "No worries," I reply, "We'll just bring this place down to our level."   Conversation with my friend flows like the beer on tap. Yet, the noise level of others' conversations begins to play ping-pong with my ear drums. Then, there was the music. Mad Props to The Roosevelt for playing tunes I was in the mood to hear - like Cold War Kids and Kings of Leon. Both bands, since seeing them live, bring me warm fuzzies. Top that off with a fantastic brew and conversation, and I'm set for the night.   Except...  There are no open seats for the night. So, after standing for an hour, you either decide to drink until you can't feel your legs, or you leave. We explored the rooms adjacent to the bar. So limited seating. I bet if you get there early with friends or a date, you'd stay all night. At least I would. I mean, there's nothing to walk away from -- but you have to get there early enough to snag your spot. And apparently on a normal Friday night, 9 p.m. isn't early enough. Plus, after some time, the cool "house party" feel begins to grate. You're elbow-to-elbow with people. So instead of this being a chill party, it becomes a disjointed social occasion. I began to feel out of place. It's almost like I wanted to turn to the people next to me and begin a conversation. The Roosevelt definitely gives off the vibe of, "Come. Hang. Be Cool." To me, part of chillin' is having conversations with interesting people. Not to distract from my friend's cool factor, but The Roosevelt is like abandoned foreplay. You get the good sensations, you want more, you wait for it... and then you're left wanting.   Looking around, there's a wide selection of people - not the kind you'd find in Scottsdale or Tempe. I like that. These people at least appear more refined and appreciative of the growing buzz The Roosevelt offers.   So, why only 4 stars? Does it deserve 5? Ask me again after the next time I go. For one thing's certain. When I go again, I'm making damn sure I get there early enough for a seat.  Maybe if I go there regularly, I can "make friendly" with the neighborhood cop. At first notice, he's off putting - walking around the side of the house, standing outside at the front gate and watching you come and go. Uhm, yeah. Maybe some kindergarten philosophy will work. "Hi, I'm Alicia. Will you be my friend?"

There's something so magical about The Roosevelt, especially when it's a slower than average night and you find yourself in the front room (not the one with the entrance; the one with the giant, uncovered window overlooking the south side of the lawn). Yes, there's something magical about sitting with a couple cool people, having a very free-flowing conversation, while Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins play overhead. There's something so relaxing and chill about this place - with candlelight and fresh flowers scattered demurely around.   And the menu... yes, plenty of beer to choose from, including a new fave cream porter from Portland. (The wine list is pretty nice, too.)  I love the rotating tap, too. I love walking by their stock and seeing kegs of Rogue. I now love that there's a "secret" bathroom outback, for those nights that are busy and you've drank your weight in pints.

This is a great little place in what you might consider an obscure shopping plaza. When I was walking up to Pie Zano's to get my carry-out order, I felt transplanted to another place and time. Hard to explain, but maybe you can understand.   Immediately I loved the cobble-stone walkways with surrounding places with patio seating. There was a distinct night chill in the air, so I felt drawn to the orange subtle glow of Pie Zano's lights, beckoning me inside.    I soon discovered that Pie Zano's has weekly specials and hosts acoustic music on Thursday evenings. You can even tailor make your own pie or go with one of their own house specials. I ordered the Garden and Greek. The latter was very, very delicious.   If that's not all, this place also has a coffee menu and offers muffins and fresh fruit, along with (as everyone has pointed out) sandwiches and frittatas. The inside seating appears cozy, like you're sitting among friends, talking about everyday things, like world affairs or music, while you enjoy a one-of-a-kind pie with a glass of wine or beer.   I definitely want to go back and dine here. Sure, carry out was fantastic and the two pies I ordered were really good, but I think part of Pie Zano's experience is being tucked away in the Town & Country shopping plaza. It's like a whole 'nother world here and Pie Zano's sits among the company of a pita place and a cajun kitchen.  Pie Zano's is the type of place that's perfect for any and every occasion. If I lived nearby, I'd walk here for coffee and breakfast. It's a great option for lunch, as well. And I'd definitely treat a friend to a pie. You just can't go wrong with Pie Zano's.   4 stars - only because I didn't have the complete dining experience.

UPDATE:  AVOID THE COFFEE! From the regular house brew to a latte, run like hell. You'll find swilling motor oil much more pleasant.   * * *  Now, here comes the Happy Hour Review:    $1.77 - that's all I gotta say. When you come here for happy hour, you leave knowing you paid as little as possible. That's a novel idea. It'd be even better if the food was worth the trip. Forget the chicken satay. Go for the southwestern egg rolls.   As for drinks, if you have a discerning palate, you're out of luck. The beer selection is very minimal. I wanted to try the Black Butte Porter. Turns out management and bar staff are arguing over what beer to sell. The two I would have drank, including Sam Adams, is not on the menu. The waitress even said, "And don't ask for Sam Adams, either. We don't have that." Well, sheesh.   $1.77 cupcake? Ok, why not. German chocolate is what I tried. It was okay, as far as cupcakes go.   It's amazing that even though you're paying $1.77 for the food you eat here, it doesn't make it taste any better. I'd much rather throw down a few more smackaroos and be satisfied then literally getting what my money paid for - $1.77 of mediocrity.

Awesome little record store. I could easily spend an hour perusing their new and used selections. I could spend another hour (at least) exploring their various listening stations. I could then spend an additional half-hour finding little neon-colored stickers that tell of upcoming local shows.  I agree with John V. Long live the record store!

I am giving my seal of approval to The Vig for a few simple, straightforward reasons:  *$3.50 pints during Happy Hour *Decent selection of beer, including Stella and Pinstripe (mmm) *So-good-you-want-to-moan artichoke dip (which would be that much better if served with warm pita bread; not chips) *Cool decor with a spacious, modern outside patio *Friendly and attentive service *Beautiful and/or interesting people to watch *Fave candle and hand lotion in the ladies room *Attracts an array of patrons, like muscle-y tat guys, Euro intellects,  buxom beauties, network engineers and writers *Trivial Pursuit cards on each table - woohoo!  A few negatives to note: *5-spiced edamama was totally meh; will never order this again *Sweet potato fries were served with regular ketchup - bleh *Has a somewhat chaotic/disorganized feel, inside and out *Smoking is permitted on the outside patio *If you don't valet, you must part across the street *Could use a couple more beers on tap!  All in all, a very nice place to grab HH after a hard day's work.   During HH the apps are 1/2 off, which allows you to order a couple to share and sample. Between my friend and I, we each had 2 beers and shared 3 apps, totaling only $30. Not bad when you split the cost.   Plus, our server was a genuine and friendly gal, as was the stunning hostess who greeted us the moment we walked through the door.

I want to like e4. I really do! I've been here a handful of times. Most were on Tuesdays, when there's no cover and dress code. It's a more relaxed night with the upstairs open, DJs, like Kevin Brown, playing in the main room, and the red (fire) room open for those who want to sit and talk.   Yet, this is not a place to go alone - no matter what night it is. It's like no matter how much you want to be invisible and just enjoy a night out, you have to contend with the "hey there! and the "oh, nice!" remarks that come from the least intelligent of men. I'm pretty good at ignoring them though, even if they try and dance around me like I'm a tiki god. Yet, spare me. Do you honestly think I find that endearing? More like insane. I want nothing more than to ram a hot steel rod up your dick. Please, leave me alone. I just came to dance.   But, there's not much space to dance. Here you'll find too many people "bopping," standing around or grinding on somebody they probably just met point-six-fve seconds ago. I despise that.   Come here on a weekend night and be ready to be mauled by what appears to be lions that haven't eaten in 150 days. You're prime rib, baby, and they're one hungry pride of lions. I even came here with a date and managed to get grabbed, tugged and teased more times than I can count. After a bit, I just gave up. I mean, standing in the corner can be fun, right? I mean, who really wants to dance to Gabriel and Dresden mixes after all. Yawn, eh? Yeah.   I really want to like e4. They need to put down "Roach Traps" to get rid of all the obnoxious losers. Maybe then people like me - those mellow types that like to go out to dance every now and then, while sipping a drink or two - can have some place cool to hang.

This may be the snobbiest place I've been to the Valley, including all of Scottsdale combined. I don't exactly understand why, though, especially considering I'm a cool chick and I don't give a rat's ass what people do in their private time. I just came to dance.   It was a friend's birthday and she invited me out on a Saturday night. Fair enough. I braved the downtown construction and dark alleys to make my way to Burn. $5 cover. No problemo. I ordered a drink at the bar and found my friend, who led the introductions. Everyone seemed really cool at first.   After I finished my drink, I decided it was time to dance. The dance floor was busy, but it wasn't packed. Perfect. I let go. I made my own little space among everyone else and just started to enjoy myself. My friend and her friends left the dance floor to sit at their tables. No biggie. I felt comfortable enough to keep on dancing by myself. It wasn't my first gay club, nor was it my first time essentially going out by myself. I felt fine, even in high heels and a mini skirt. Plus, the music was good. How can ya not dance when the DJ is mixing great club beats with popular hits?  You see, I'm used to people in the gay community being very friendly towards me. I'm used to people being open-minded and supportive of anyone who wants to support any local establishment that's geared toward open-mindedness and tolerance. With that said, I felt like I was so unwelcome here. I'm used to feeling like people are happy to see me, especially at a gay bar. I mean, I'm not a lesbian, but I don't care if you are. So... imagine my surprise when I continued to get bumped into, pushed around and frowned at. Was I doing something wrong? Was I off beat? Doubtful. Was my skirt riding up? Not likely. And so what? Even if I decided to strip down to my undies, I shouldn't be judged - especially here, where I embrace people's differences. I'm not a judgemental person by any means. It really began to bother me that people were treating me like an outcast.   I think I stayed an hour, tops. I couldn't take it any more. I don't like people to bump into me as if I'm not even there. Trust me, it wasn't because somebody had drank too much or had just learned to walk the day before. I got the feeling it was because I was there - end of story. Needless to say, I will not be going back to Burn. If I want to be judged and ridiculed, I'll head to Scottsdale, thank you very much.

I've died and gone to Cornish Pasty Heaven.   I ordered The Pilgrim: turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, stuffing. Yum. It came with a side of cranberry sauce. It was very, very tasty. I'm a sucker for bread, and these carbs were damn fine. My lunch pal had the Chicken Pesto and remarked it was some of the best chicken he's ever had. I see his point, since the fowl in my pasty was perfectly prepared.  I told our friendly server about Yelp. She had never heard of it, but I said she should check it out - that Cornish Pasty Co. has some outstanding reviews. She said she would be sure to let the owners know. Then she let us know they are opening up another location soon that is family-friendly, with plans for a 3rd in a couple years. Mo' Pasty = Mo' Betta'   Cornish Pasty, I will be back! You have quite the beer selection, including 3 sizes on draft to choose from... including Rogue's Hazelnut Brown! Not to mention alot of bottles.   Yep. I'm coming back soon. Among the Cornish Pasty Cornucopia, i want to find my pasty prize - the one pasty choice that is like a sexy sweet nothing whispered in my ear. You know the type - the it's-so-wrong-it's-so-right type, the just-got-to-have-it type, the sensory-overload type... Ah, yes. I want a carbtastic pasty prize, full of satisfying flavors that melt in my mouth and tickle my tongue!

Tried their Chicken Greek. It was tasty. But, it didn't wow me. Why didn't it wow me? Is my wow-o-meter broken? Shouldn't the pasty wow me? I mean, this place has got some serious fans. And I totally dig this place. But, again, I wasn't wowed by the pasty. And I really think I should have been.   I need to go during happy hour, when I can pair my pasty with a Rogue Hazelnut Brown.

Panera Bread.   That's what I thought of when I first walked in. Wildflower is to Phoenix as Panera is to Oklahoma City, where I used to live. Yet, I wasn't quite accurate with that. You see, Wildflower goes above and beyond your typical bread company/eatery. Sure, places like Panera are great but Wildflower is in a league of its own.   Lucky for me, I knew what I wanted right away, which is unusual when I first encounter a new, exciting array of options. I chose their chicken basil chili and 1/2 their roast beef & Gorgonzola sandwich. Both were perfect - really. The chili was festive without being overly filling, for the 1/2 sandwich was a generous portion of sourdough bread, fresh tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, peppers (so good!) and Gorgonzola cheese. Plus, their herb mayo was an added touch I could enjoy (and I usually hate mayo).   My lunch companion ordered their black bean soup with a 1/2 turkey breast and brie sandwich. It looked equally perfect, with huge slices of brie satisfying my cheese-lovin' friend.   Plus, the price for this pairing was reasonable - just under $8.   My friend got a pretzel for us to share. It was definitely good, not to mention one of the biggest pretzels I've ever seen!   In fact, I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this place. When you walk in, you immediately see their vast selection of breads and sweets. Their menu is also diverse with a variety of options. You could probably eat here every day of the week and find something new and delightful with each experience.   I say experience because that's about what it is. You order your food at the register and get a table marker to place on your table. Shortly after, your meal comes hot and lookin' divine - really. While this is a get-your-own-beverage place, you can enjoy some of the perks of being waited on, like your food being delivered with clean silverware, as well as your plate being cleared when you finish. I like that alot. Then you can enjoy a few moments post-meal to chat with your comrad(s).  In the middle of the restaurant is this over-sized beautiful light (chandelier style) that looks like roots sprouting flowers. It's something, alright. I made the comment that I'd have that in my house, if I owned one - a house, that is.. Sure, that may be a bit over-the-top, but it's indicative of how I felt while dining here for lunch. Granted, I give my companion some credit, for I always enjoy her company. Also, she's the one who suggested we eat here. For that, I owe her - perhaps I'll spring for lunch next time (great excuse to make a return visit).   GOOD NEWS! I think I found my new favorite place to dine when I'm craving soup, a gourmet sandwich or fresh salad.   They also serve breakfast, have a kids section of the menu and whip up some fantastic cafe beverages, including ones that tempted me: the roasted honey cappuccino and the peppermint hot cocoa.   I definitely need to make a repeat visit, try their different breads and indulge in their breakfast menu, which is served until 2 p.m. on weekends. I mean, c'mon, can you really resist the roasted tomato feta & egg sandwich or the lemon ricotta pancakes? I didn't think so.

If it weren't for the location, there'd be no reason to go to this theatre.   I went this past weekend with my family. Firstly, the escalators were broken and the only open concession was upstairs. We took the elevator. Then, after some indecision, I settled on something to eat - only to find out they don't have it! My dad, always the funny one, said, "They even have prices for what they don't sell. And pictures too!"   We got our treats, found our theatre and claimed our seats. I walked next door while I munched and waited for my previews to start. The room next to ours felt like a sauna. Poor movie goers. That would suck to be stuck in a 85-degree room on a 105 degree day. Ugh.   Bathrooms were typical - no surprises there.   There are many other BETTER theatres to venture to on the weekend, or any other day, for that matter. I wouldn't recommend this place, unless you're already on Mill, you got your parking validated and you simply can't justify going somewhere else.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, considering most theatres are gaudy with bright lights and huge posters. But, shy as it might be in today's modern entertainment jungle, Tempe Valley Art is a fantastic little place. How can one not like a one-screen theatre that plays mostly obscure, low-budget, indie films, like Juno, alongside some of the bigger known names, including Babel?    You might expect a tiny viewing room when you walk in, but you'll be pleasantly surprised to find one of the biggest theatre rooms in the area (sure beats some of the rooms at the theatre farther South off Mill Ave.)   Here's where I saw the final cut for Blade Runner. We sat in the back after I was told that's exactly where you needed to sit during a movie like this. I'm thinking it's where you should sit for every movie, for you're able to drink in the entire screen. Bonus: there weren't any squirmy or screaming children to contend with - not like you'll find at major theatres or mall areas.   In conclusion, 3 parting thoughts:   1) I love this theatre!   2) I think I'll make a point to see a movie here once a month, starting with Juno when it begins playing here. This is the kind of pact every one should make.   3) If you've never been to this theatre, you're doing yourself a disservice. You should be kinder to yourself. Seriously. Go check out Valley Art Theatre today.

Miso happy! This is the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. By far. Hands down.  Best miso soup - ever. I had their salmon oyster roll thing - raw oyster wrapped in a piece of salmon with salmon roe on top. It was divine! (I fantasize about this, seriously.) Their soft shell crab is... wow. Melt in your mouth perfection.   They don't do happy hour, but the prices end up being very reasonable for what you get. I tried their baby yellow tail and a huge piece of clam. Tasty!   Yasu is small, so get there early. The place can fill up quick! I love the atmosphere inside. The service is superb and the staff is uber-friendly. When we walked in, the guy behind the bar waved at us.   If you don't live nearby, it's ok. The sushi is definitely worth the drive. And if you live close-by, I hate you. (Just kidding. Or am I?)

One of the best places on Roosevelt Row, Made has a plethora of things to catch your eye and keep your attention. From funny gifts to thoughtful ones, this store is a gold mine, if you're looking to please a friend, partner or work mate. I mean, if you're not thrilled by their selection of cool (and sometimes political) magnets or buttons, you can always go with the books that'll teach you all you need to know about urban slang.   But if it's thoughtful you're after, you can find it here. From soy candles to handmade purses, you got options. I personally loved the baby stuff, the funny tablets ("What You Should Do To Make Me Happy") and the pottery/bowls.   I can definitely see myself coming back here on numerous occasions when I need to buy a gift for something who appreciate unique, quirky, creative and funny gifts.   You need to check this place out. Aside from being interesting and fun, it smells great, too!

Okay, you caught me. I f'n love this place. It's THE place I want to go when I want to somewhere - so forgive me friends if I pester you with going out, for I often have a hankering from what The Lost Leaf is selling. It's an art bar, with incredible beers to pick from and music to listen to. I can't get enough of this place.   If it tells you anything, I chose to hang out here to celebrate my birthday this past February. It's the one and only place I wanted to go, and I am so thrilled my friends either a) already loved this place or b) heard such great things about The Lost Leaf, they couldn't wait to check it out. At the end of the night, everyone in my party were Lost Leaf believers. Amen!  *   *  *   MY FIRST REVIEW OF THE LOST LEAF:  I absolutely love this place! Hardwood floors. Exposed brick walls and columns. A high ceiling. Low lighting. Art on the walls. Fun coasters on the table. Hues of red wafting through the interior. Plenty of tables and seats, even in different "sections" of the place. A cozy bar with an impressive beer menu. I love love love The Lost Leaf.   After watching Lars and The Real Girl (an outstanding movie, btw), my comrade and I ventured to find a beer. Not just any beer. I told him The Roosevelt had a great HazelNut Brown (from Rogue). I was itchin' for that. Well, I texted Google to find the address to The Roosevelt, but nothing came back. (It's true, you can text Google for just about anything now!) Having realized The Lost Leaf was in the same area, I texted Google again. Success! So, we headed toward that area and stumbled upon The Lost Leaf. (I know it's hard to stumble upon anything when you have the direct address, but humor me.)   For a Sunday night around 8, this place was semi-busy. About 5 people at the bar and a couple tables occupied. Of course, the bartender was quick to tell us that last Sunday was a bit heavier with traffic, and if we stuck around, we'd get to hear one of the best local jazz bands. Too bad we really hadn't planned to stay out that late, for I do love jazz.   The bartender went on to tell me two things I didn't know. 1. There's a Third Friday that's supposedly better than First Friday because it's not over-run by band-wagoners. Awesome. 2. If you peddle your bike to the bar, your first beer is a buck. Yep, just one dollar. You can't beat that! (You don't actually peddle to the bar. You can park your bike outside.)  I felt right at home at this place. I can't put my finger on just one thing. I think it's the entire experience, from decor and service to even the music, for whatever XM or satellite station they had on, it played Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's "Weapon of Choice." %&*#$!!! There's nothing like a favorite song by a favorite band to trigger great memories and jump-start really good conversations.   But, enough about that. Let's talk beer. I knew right away what I wanted when I saw they offered the Rogue HazelNut Brown. 22 oz. Yes! (And for $7.) My friend got the Monk Madness, also from Rogue, and enjoyed it very much. We sampled each other's and concurred: we each made the right choice. 22 oz is alot to swallow, so I took my time, enjoying how the 13 ingredient beer hit the spot. Ahhh....!   I definitely will be back to The Lost Leaf. I feel like it's my kind of place. I guess if I had to pick any place in Phoenix that reflected my personality, I'd pick this one. I think it has character, a unique and clear vibe, catering to artistic expression and "mood" lighting. Plus, there's also wine available for the nights I'm feeling like slipping into a happy, relaxed state of mind. Definitely, this place is where I can get lost from the everyday hum-drum and just be myself.

Since 1993... that's how long I've been a Phoenix fan. Yes, since the days of KJ, Barkley, Ainge, Majerle and coach Paul Westphal. Sure, it may have been the beginning of "the Barkley era," but to me, it was the beginning of something better: a team worth watching. C'mon, cut me some slack. I was 13. How many 13 y/o teenage girls do you know who stay up late to watch NBA playoffs? Well, I certainly did. (It's also the year I discovered Chipper Jones and the Braves, but let's not go there.)  1993 was also the year I visited Phoenix and saw the arena. I was star-stuck. It was massive to me. 360 degrees of seats. And one was all mine!  Now, in 2007/08, we're in "the Steve Nash and the Run n' Gun era," which is just as exciting to me. Sure, I may be 14 years older, but that doesn't mean I've lost any excitement or appreciation for a great basketball team who displays showmanship and skill. Not to mention they each have their own unique personality and bring a little "sumptin sumptin" to the team. Steve Nash. Raja Bell. Grant Hill, Amare Stoudemire and Shawn Marion.... Don't tell me this isn't the most talented team in the league. (Only thing missing is my guy, Dirk. Don't hate. He's one of the best players in the league and a nice guy. I've met him.)   2006 was the first year I was able to go to a real-life Suns game. It was so much fun. I look forward to snaggin' another seat and going again, especially now that I don't have a bedtime and I can drink legally during the games. Good times!

AH-MAZ-ING.  I love this park. Too bad we met for the first time during my final week living in Phoenix. Otherwise, this park would have become a regular staple in my active life. Walking...running...basketball...tennis... They even have baseball cages and a skate park! Now, I probably wouldn't have done either of those, for fear of offing myself. But, hey, I love to watch and having both around brings a very cool vibe, you know?   The walking/running sidewalk meanders around nice, calming waters.   There's even some electrical outlets near the picnic/play area. So you can fire up the ol' laptop while you watch the kiddies play and chase each other around. So awesome.   If I ever were to buy a home in the Phoenix area, this is the first place I'd consider - near this park, which is quite big for parks in Phoenix and, as mentioned before, offers an array of very fun things to do. Heck, there's even a path to ride horses on!  Here's info on the skate park: http://www.ci.gilbert.az.us/parks/popups/skatepark.cfm  Enjoy!

What sets one sports bar apart from the rest? It could be the brew on tap. Perhaps it's the size of the TV's. Possibly it's the sports memorabilia on the walls. What sets Boston's apart from the rest of the sports bars I've been to is, well, the comfortable feeling I get when I'm there. I'm allowed to drink my mammoth Oktoberfest Sam Adams and stare at the huge TV broadcasting the first game of the World Series - and I can do both without worrying about getting interrupted by rowdy patrons. The only noise I heard was clapping and cheering for the Red Sox. I'm down with that.   My Boston experience was a first for me. I met a fellow Yelper out to catch the first part of Game One of the World Series. I was only nervous about the game - would the bar play it with sound? Yes! All my worrying was for naught, for they had the game on nearly all their TVs, minus a few that broad casted some NBA and NFL games. Didn't matter to me, as long as the World Series game was on with sound.   I was asked what I wanted to drink. I wanted Sam Adams. Had to have Sam Adams. Perfect, they had Oktoberfest. I ordered a tall. Never mind the pint. I knew I was going to be there a while. What I didn't know what that "tall" meant "tall and fat." This beer was HUGE. We're talking mammoth huge! "Holy $h|t!" I said when he plopped the delicious beer on my table. No way I was going to be able to drink that without food and drive home after the game. So, about 1/2 way into the mammoth beer, I ordered the Chicken Da Vinci pizza. Yum!   When I finished off my huge beer, I ordered a pint of the same thing. Oh, why not? I felt comfortable at Boston's, so even when my new friend left, I was content to stay put for a while longer... especially to see the Red Sox spank the Rockies.   Our server was friendly and attentive. He made sure our drinks were filled and our bellies were full. Plus, he wasn't in any rush to shoo me away from the game. He even made sure I had plenty of water to balance my consumption of beer. Ain't that sweet?   When I staggered to the bathroom after my mammoth beer, I was amused to find the handles to the "Hers" to be a baseball bat. Simply perfect, yep.  I like Boston's. I'd definitely catch another WS game there. Come to think of it, I'd catch several other sports games there, too. Especially knowing I can drink 1/15th of my weight in a single glass!

I was hoping I'd be the first to review D'Vine. Why? Well, for selfish reasons, of course. I wanted to be the one to say, "Look at this spectacular place! It's a gem!" Certainly, I can say that regardless of if I'm the first review or the 150th.   What makes this place so great? Maybe it's the intimate setting they've created with dim lighting, impeccable service, the wide wine selection, the savory menu or the fact they host live music, including local bands like Ten Dollar Outfit.   Don't want to sit inside? No problem. They have a comfortable patio with misters. Simple candles adorn the tabletops.   Don't want to sit in the heat? Select a comfortable vantage point on one of their comfy couches, sit at the bar and chat with the staff (or your date, for that matter) or sit at a table for two (bar table heights available).   Another great quality of this place is the art that adds a certain flavor to the place.   I also enjoy perusing their wine selection, for they sale by the bottle, too. May I recommend the Victor Hugo or Matchbox blends.   When you need the perfect wine, red or blend for a dinner, simply stop in and ask for their preferences. Tell them what's on the menu. Whether it's lobster, chicken or pork, they'll have the perfect recommendation for you. They certainly did for me, and the wine I brought for a certain occasion last summer definitely made an impression!   The location isn't the best (yet it's not the worst, by any means) .Then again, if it were anywhere else, it would be swarming with unappreciative patrons. Instead, this is more of a treasure to people in Mesa who enjoy a relaxing, joyful night out of the house.  For more, visit their website: http://www.dvinewine101.com/

Let me start off by saying, this isn't a 5 star place to eat. But, I give it a mighty big round up. Why? Read on.   The food - 3.5 star worthy. You won't sink your teeth into the best gyro you've ever had, but both the beef and Mediterranean chicken gyros are good. Not great, but good. Portions are generous if you order a wrap. You'll probably need a box for 1/2 your wrap, unless you just have an ungodly appetite. Salads are big, too, and come with plenty of tomatoes and cucumber slices. Now, the hummus, that's good. Try their jalapeno hummus. Quite tasty.   Service - 3.5 stars. You won't fall over backwards with surprise, but you shouldn't have any real complaints either. Even during peak hours, like lunchtime, wait time is short, even if you arrive with a hungry group of 7. Splitting up of the check was painless, too. The waitstaff doesn't seem to have much personality, but at least they get to wear whatever they'd like, which can be interesting when you try and figure out who works there (and who doesn't). They're also attentive to your beverage, so refills are no problemo - which is a good thing when you're chowing on Greek grub.   Atmosphere - 4 stars. It's welcoming, laid back and clean. You can peek into the kitchen while they prep the food. Even for it being cramped, Pita Jungle still manages to appear more open than you'd expect. You don't feel crowded here, nor do you drown in the conversations of others, even during high traffic times. Also, there's art on the wall, which is usually great eye candy.   Artistic Support - 5 stars. This is the clincher. You see, I think it's really awesome that Pita Jungle supports local artists. Don't believe me? Go in the month of December and get a glimpse of the World of Rynaga. The entire concept - books, prints, Web site, etc. - belongs to a local artist. (http://www.rynaga.com/)   Let's recap. While the food is really good (not great) and the atmosphere is inviting and friendly, I give Pita Jungle 5 stars for being a super cool restaurant that lends a hand to help expose local artists by displaying their art on their walls for all their hungry patrons to see.

$10.50 got me a 16oz hot, dirty chai and chef salad.   I loved me the hot, dirty chai. Plus, it's just fun to say.   The salad was tasty. Great portion size. Often we think we can stuff our faces with lettuce, turkey slices and eggs...but we can't. Let's face it. D'lish does a great job of making a well-balanced salad.   The guys who run this place are also very easy on the eyes.   The menu is expansive, offering up breakfast choices with lighter fare, including smoothies. Ingredients are said to be mostly organic. Yep, I like this place alot, actually.   And it's very cool they have a drive-thru.   I also dug the music while I was there. It was from one guy's laptop; so you know he's got a great library of tunes. Thumbs up for me.   If you haven't gone here, go. Even if it's for a coffee. You may find, though, that when you arrive, you can't resist their menu options.

Great Sprint store with extraordinary customer service. Horrible location, though, being smack dab next to a high-traffic Chipotle, which seems to always be busy.   I've come to this Sprint store twice now for customer service issues. No, there wasn't anything wrong with my phone or my plan. In fact, the first time I stopped in was to address my battery issue. I couldn't keep a charge. The guy behind the counter exchanged my old battery for a new one - at no cost. Then he said he'd knock $5 off my text fees - something about a special promotion I was eligible for.  Very cool.   My second visit was to activate a new phone and change my plan to the new Everything Plan. What a cinch! I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Could it really be that simple? Yes, I guess so.   Say what you will about Sprint, but I'm stickin' to this carrier, especially if they offer a new coverage plan with unlimited messaging (including text, picture mail, web access, etc.) WITHOUT demanding I extend my contract. Plus, my phone works everywhere I travel. I really can't say the same for Altell, T-Mobile or Verizon. (And I simply refuse to use AT&T for reasons that'll remain confidential.)   *steps off soapbox*  So, yeah, anyway. Got a Sprint or Nextel phone? Bookmark this location. It's not one in which you can get your phone repaired (you'll have to go elsewhere for that) but for anything else, this is the store I recommend.

My inital reaction: Very clean, bright and organized. These folks have tanning down to a science. From package deals to pro-rated fees and upgrades, you don't have to worry about streching your buck. They'll take your money and figure out the math. But, they'll clue you in. Ask them for advice, and they happily oblige. With different levels, the tanning options are diverse. This includes the package deals and the different styles of tanning beds. Not to mention their plethora of tanning lotions and ointments.   Oh, and did I mention they have a butt ton of magazines to read? Only, I haven't once had to wait more than a couple minutes to tan. But, it's always comforting to know the 'zines are there.   When you first join, you pay the membership fee, which will then be applied to your first package. You also buy your eye wear and are expected to bring it each time. If you forget, you can buy some little copper-y stickers for like $.50.   Something to note: There is a monthly fee. If you ask me, it's a bit absurd, but, like I said, these guys have this down to a science. It's almost genius how they run this place. Even the cleaning lady is on top of things.   I would recommend this place to anyone who has the extra stash of cash laying around, for with a $20 monthly fee + $50 package (average one offered), that adds up to a pretty penny or two or a thousand. Then if you want some bronze on your hot bod, you have to buy the lotion. The cheapest they offer runs over $30. (Something to note: The $50 package grants me an avg of 12 tans if I go for a max of 12 minutes per tan at Level 2... so yeah...)  It's definitley a Scottsdale establishment in that regard. I'm happy to report, though, that none of the people working the front desk are snotty, rude or impatient. They have always been friendly and helpful, and to me, that's worth its weight in gold.

Hey Southwest:  It's no surprise why people whisper behind your back, calling you "SouthWORST." It's no surprise why, when asked, your unfortunate patrons say they feel miserable whenever they fly on your airline. It's true. You make people miserable - with your strange and stupid delays, your cattle-call boarding, your small seats with no leg room and your rude, obnoxious employees.   To your surprise, it does, indeed, sometimes rain in Phoenix (and even Las Vegas, for that matter). Sometimes with rain, comes fog and low visibility. I think you should have learned that in 3rd grade science. In any case, whenever it rains, you, SouthWORST, forget flying fundamentals - perhaps like an actor with stage fright - and simply refuse to perform.   It's true; you make people miserable. You make them wait in other cramped airports for four to six hours (maybe longer), just hoping to soon be boarding, just hoping there's not an excruciating wait on the tar mat or that their checked bag(s) won't end up in Bangladesh.  They say misery likes company. I believe you hate yourself, SouthWORST. I would, too, if I were you. So, in hating yourself, you hate others. You bully them, take their money, make them wait, cackle when you know they're hungry, tired and in need of some deodorant and a breath mint. You're miserable, SouthWORST, and you make me miserable, too.   Disregards,  Alicia

I was not expecting much from Lemongrass Thai, especially when my friend and I pulled into the sardine-tight parking lot. It looked like the most dingy place in Tempe. Little did I know it would be one of the best lunches I've had without spending a small fortune.   In fact, without tip, my entree (with water) was $7.52. I ordered the #7 - with eggplant, green peppers, carrots and tofu (yum!) and nixed the onions. The dish came with a pile of white rice, a small egg roll and a little bit of dipping sauce for the egg roll. It was all VERY GOOD!   The atmosphere doesn't amount to much. The service is just okay. The people taking your orders and bringing the food aren't what I'd call "people pleasers," but they're there to make some mean lunch dishes - not schmooze and win you over with charm. But, let's face it, the food spoke for itself. I had every intention of eating only 1/2 and saving the other portion for later. I couldn't stop eating. The flavors were great! And the fare was light enough that I wasn't stuffed and leaving with a bloated tummy.   An added touch: A wrapped mint at the end.   A sad note: I tried to order the Green Chai Tea. "No Green Chai Tea!" I was told. Bummer.   I would definitely go back here and recommend it to anyone who likes Thai, especially those who are fortunate enough to live and/or work nearby. Just beware of the parking lot!

Only on eight...  You sucked me in with your special on overweight people training for and running a marathon. (I even got a bit choked up.)  You excited me with the new Wired special. Perfect for my inner geek.  You intrigued me with Celtic Woman. Somehow I was engrossed, and I couldn't explain it.  You speak to my literature and film fascination with Masterpiece Theatre. Too bad I usually end up stumbling upon the stories when they're half-way over.   You got me to pledge money during your fund-raising special. Now that's a damn near miracle. Thanks for the tax write off!   You send me a monthly program so that I may pre-plan when my ass and couch will make contact.   You send me letters and special invitations by mail and email. I start to feel special, until I realize you expect me to give more money. Atleast I can recycle!  All in all, you continue to spark my interest and keep me watching. Well done!

I'm giving this Urban a perfect rating, for it never fails that when I walk through its doors, I always find something I want (or could) buy - even if it's a gift for somebody else, like my younger sister or best bud in Detroit. I even found one of my favorite sweaters here on clearance for $20. I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe, so if I had my choice, I'd come here to browse and buy.   Plus, it's within walking distance of Scottsdale Fashion Park, Borders and Olive & Ivy (the perfect spot for brunch/lunch).

I stayed here when it was the Aladdin, on its way to becoming Planet Hollywood. It was partially under construction, but I didn't mind.   This was a great hotel, though I don't have much experience with Vegas Hotels in general. The casino was cool - plenty of open machines to play, including video poker at the bar.   I thought it was even cooler to have the "underground mall" that was unlike anything I have ever seen before. But, hey, it's Vegas, innit? Stores upon stores upon stores upon places to eat and drink... wow.   There was so much to do here - just at this one location - that I didn't feel much need to check out other hotels, although I was told I needed to, since each one boasts their own "appeal."   I'd definitely consider staying at this hotel again. The room, with two queen-sized beds, was spacious, clean and offered up a HUGE bathroom, which was good, considering I shared the room with two other ladies.   Plus, since I got a bit too inebriated (let's face it, i was hammered) one night and spent around 5 hours passed out at the base of the toilet, I'd say even the bathroom floor deserves 4 stars!

AMAZING!  I had no idea this even existed. What rock was I living under when I lived in Phoenix for 3 years? I mean, MY GAWD! This place is super cool. From the concept and vibe to the menu and coffee.... wowza. I was so impressed with this place, I could not be happier.   Their coffee is divine.  The veggie egg scrambler I had was beyond spectacular.  And just sitting inside, chilling on a summer morning, you felt like you hadn't a care in the world. It was so inviting, with open windows overlooking Agritopia.   I was thrilled when my friend took me here. I can't rave about this place enough.   Oh, except, where was the recycle bins? That's the only thing this place is lacking.

What comes to mind when somebody mentions "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" Laughter, right? Even side splitting comedy, unique scenarios and improvisation. Well, Jesterz is no different. Located in the Papago Plaza at the corner of McDowell and Scottsdale Road, the spot, called Theater 168 due to the location, is tucked into a retail plaza. Blink and you might miss it. Yet, once inside, don't let the decor (or lack thereof) fool you. This isn't about props and paint swatches. This is about comedy, performed on the fly with audience participation.   Come prepared to laugh so hard, you almost choke on your gum, like I did.   Come prepared to participate, to voice suggestions, topic ideas, emotions.  Watch a cohesive team of jesterz weave together comedy - right before your eyes!   It's suitable for all ages and is an absolutely perfect date idea. Or, go with friends and family. Bottom line: Just go. You'll leave feeling cheerful and energized. And, if you're like me, you'll be talking about the jokes, the comedy, the laughter, the fun for days and days... so much so that you'll want to go back!  Basic info: The Jester'Z perform every Friday and Saturday night at 8:00 & 10pm at Theater 168. Tickets are $12 for the 8pm show and $10 for the 10pm. There is no age restriction and never a drink minimum. (Concessions available at the snack bar)

Oh, what a wonderful feeling...   Picture this: A Young Woman moves from a city known for its Asian fare and bubble (boba) tea - only to discover her new Dessert Playland is devoid of her favorite sweet treat. We're talkin' about all types of bubble tea, including mixtures with different flavored jellies. We're talking Boba Heaven. So, imagine the vast disappointed of said Young Woman when she realizes she's traded her Asian District fare and Boba for Mexican Food Mecca and Horchata. Not that there's anything wrong with any of this... except a world without boba is a sad, sad world.   Enter Eba.   When I stopped here the other day for the first time, I had very low expectations. I was imagining limited options. Oh? Boba Tea of only milk and tapioca? Bummer. Little did I know that Eba is the real deal.  I walked up to the register.   Me: "Do you have coffee jelly?" Owner: "Yes." Me: "I love you!"   I jumped for joy.   I ordered an iced coffee latte with coffee jelly. Talk about a blast from the past I never thought I'd have again. (Let alone find in Phoenix!)  Eba is now - by far - one of my favorite places in Phoenix!

I give mad props to Red Hot Robot for supporting local artists. I dropped by last night to see my friend's exhibit and was really pleased at the turn out. Of course, this is is a niche market - people who like collectible toys that are worth more on display than in the sandbox. It's cool to see what kind of market toy art has. From books to random trinkets to tee's, you'll find a fair selection at Red Hot Robot. I can't rank this 5 stars for it's not really the type of art and store that gets me excited, but i was very, very happy to know there's somebody out there who owns an independent store that really is trying to promote local artists, like my friend. Check out his stuff on his site: http://steamcrow.com/

Uhm, totally not a place where you can go and relax, unless you're with a group of friends. There's just this "run-down, seedy, unkempt and dangerous" vibe you get when you approach The Ruby Room.   I'm no chicken sh*t. I can deal with dive bars. I like them, actually, but not when the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up. If The Ruby Room were in another location - perhaps in the neighborhood of Modified Arts and Lost Leaf - it would be a sure-bet.   The decor can feel very vampire-like, though, with dark, red walls, low lighting and the naked women on the wall, looking down at you. Plus, they now serve absinthe. (As for their beer selection? Meager, at best.)  Again, if you're going out with friends, this place could be fun. Otherwise, don't bother.

Been only once. Had the biggest sandwich ever known to man - with 6 slices of bacon. Cut the beast in half and it looked like two regular size sandwiches. To me, that translated to "late night snack."   Service was quick 'n friendly. The decor is interesting. Unique ceiling fans. I don't remember much about the decor - too busy staring at the sandwich, which, upon request, came with a side of fresh fruit. Yum!  Word of advice: tote a jacket. I froze my ta ta's off.

San Francisco. Paris. Washington DC. In any of these cities, FOODBar would be comfortably at home. Imagine a constant stream of foot traffic coming and going  - doors swinging open, cash registers opening and closing, hungry business professionals pointing at glass displays, while their foggy morning minds awaken to the idea of breakfast. Yes, FOODBar is designed to satiate a constant flux of growling stomachs.   In several ways, this establishment reminds me of the bakeries and cafes you'll find in larger metro areas, like DC. That's why i love this place. The entire concept gets two big thumbs up from me. For, you see, while AZ people are used to a more leisurely approach to food and ordering, most major cities have no patience for an indecisive person holding up the line. Most hungry and hurried professionals know immediately what to order, or they understand that a less-than-snappy decision will warrant snarls and glares from people waiting in life behind them.   Well, while I love the leisure vibe of Phoenix, I understand that in any other major metro, FoodBAR would be an instant success - especially since it belongs in a downtown/center mecca area.   When you step inside, immediately you see that the line to decide and order will lead you to the register to pay. Behind the glass displays sit your numerous options. From Waldorf and couscous salads to rotisserie-style chickens and bulging muffins, you have a plethora of options.   It's not easy to decide what to order when you're awe-struck at the delicious looking choices before your eyes. The man behind the counter let me know he was available for any ques. or to let me sample something. I took advantage of his offer and sampled the couscous, which I decided to order. $3.50 for a side salad.   Then I rounded the corner, past the attractive and succulent slow-cooking chickens and continued to the register - past the tempting muffins - where I asked for a side of chicken with my salad, as well a small Fuji water, which is stored in the sliding-glass fridge past the register. All this rung up under $8. Nice.   After paying, I took a table marker and found a spot with my co-workers. We sat at a bar-style area half-way between the main area and the coffee/to-go part of FOODBar. The seating was surprising comfortable.   Within minutes, my food arrived. After mixing the chicken with the salad, it was apparent I'd need a to-go container. Portions are huge! I saw a couple sandwiches pass by that could EASILY be split between two people. That comes to about $5 for a huge 1/2 sandwich. Talk about a good deal! As for taste, it was very refreshing. It could have used some freshly grated cheese on top (but that's just me - i'm a sucker for cheese). In the salad was almond slivers, cranberries and dried apricots. Yum!  I thought the service was very, very good. My co-worker was asked if she wanted water. That was an added touch, since she was sitting there keeping me company without any drink in-hand.   On a negative note: I was not given a receipt. I watched as the girl who rang me up crumbled up my slip of paper and tossed it. I would have atleast liked to have been asked if I wanted it. But, I figure that's just an inexperienced employee and should not reflect on how cool this place really is. (I'm guessing my generous side of chicken was $3.50, too, but I can't confirm that w/o a receipt.)  I love FOODBar. I look forward to going back and trying their coffee, their bakery items, perhaps a sammie or another salad.   Their menu is so huge, I probably missed a few options when I went. I would have liked to see a cup of fresh fruit on the menu. It's an added touch I like with my lunch. Or maybe I'll go sometime for dinner, since they do serve wine and beer.   After a quick bite here, I really wished I would have stepped outside into a different city - one that is ped-friendly and bustling with city life, like Market St in San Francisco or Dupont Circle in DC. Alas, when we left, there was hardly anyone around. In this regard, FOODBar seems to be a hidden gem. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. C'est la vie.

Too bad they had to go on hiatus and change their name (as to narrowly escape a lawsuit from Phoenix magazine). I guess they'll be back in a month plus, give or take.   Either way, I'm an avid fan. I'm not too keen on the name change (Fahrenheit), for it sounds too "Scottsdale" to me. Hopefully that's the only thing about this magazine that makes me think of the fashionably ludicrous sister city to our Northeast.

I can hang at this place, provided it's the right show that entices me through the front door. Like last night. I came here specifically to see Okkervil River. I didn't have a ticket. I walked up 1 hour and 15 minutes after the doors open. And did I get in? Yep. For the same price as everyone else. $15. That alone is worth more than people realize, for try showing up at a venue in Austin, Boston or Chicago and expect to get right in. Doesn't happen, at least in my experience. (This is a big plus for Phoenix in my book.)  This place could be a "dive," but I've been to worse. So, the interior didn't faze me. And thanks to a head's up from John V, I knew not to expect the best beer selection. So, I opted for water. Free, baby. Can't go wrong with that, especially in this state... and ESPECIALLY inside The Clubhouse, where it's more sultry and steamy than a panty-less Penthouse Party.   And even if I did want a drink, I don't think I could have talkd myself into paying $4 or $5 for swill. Even though I had free water, I sweat my arse off. I spotted a woman with a fan at the bar. I was jealous. Why didn't I think of that?   It was standing room only, but I expected as much. I was surprised, though, to notice ample room. It wasn't sweaty arm to sweaty arm, like I thought it may be. Could have been due to a Thursday night, or maybe I got lucky. Whatever the case, I didn't have to feel the direct heat of somebody's body, along with the stifling inside air (no circulation whatsoever, ugh).   As for the show, I wondered to myself if I was the only one questioning the acoustics. The set was great. The band performed quite well. I just wonder if, in another venue, the music would have been sharper. Hmm. At least the stage is big enough for the band to jump around - a little. Nothing sucks worrse than having no room to rock out!  I also didn't like how the bar area was quite well lit for a music venue. It took away from the experience, and I wasn't about to saunter up to the stage and pack in like a sardine, even though it was dark up front. Besides, by standing a little farther back, I could see the whole stage. Best "seat" in the house, if you ask me.   As for parking, forgetaboutit. Get there early or plan to find a spot somewhere other than the parking lot. I had a short walk to the venue, which I don't recommend if you're a lady, flyin' solo. Lucky for me, a cool Yelper gave me a lift to my car afterwards.   Oh, yeah, that's the other thing that makes this place cool: company. I'm not sure I would have had such a great time if I ended up being utterly alone. I'm glad I ran into a couple people I know! Then again, this isn't the type of place that scares me. I'd go back alone, if that were my only option, for the vibe inside is relaxed and there's plenty of Security. They don't search you, either, which I appreciated. I'm not here to case the joint; I'm hear to listen to my heart's content to a band that, thanks to The Clubhouse, came rollin' through Phoenix last night.  So, yeah. 4 stars from me. I like venues like this, especially when they host bands that otherwise would have no stage to play on. Clubhouse, keep it up!

This place is hands-down one cool place to hang. From hardwood floors to wooden barrels as mini-bars, you can't go wrong here. If you're with a group, you have options - tables near the music or wooden benches tucked in the back corner, just right of the entrance. Or, if you're with just one or two, you can take up a spot near the dart board and pool table - sort of your own little playground. Or, for those of us who like saddling up to the bar, you have that choice, too.   There's no smoking inside, thankfully. When you used to be able to light up, the place filled up fast with smoke. It was an asthmatic's worst nightmare.  The bartenders are exceptionally nice and attentive. The music is generally some of the best you'll hear around the Valley. Especially when they bring in their staple Irish bands. (I've heard some of the best Irish music here!)  Fibber's was the first Irish Pub I visited when I moved here. It was a Thursday night. The pub was active, but not overwhelmingly so. My friend and I were able to entertain ourselves with a few games of pool and darts. Then the music started. It was great. The atmosphere was causal, friendly and you could tell people here were regulars.   I recommend this place to anyone in the area, or anyone itching to try a new place. It's easy to find, off Elliot Rd, (just east of the 101) in a plaza. You walk inside and the lighting is dim, the wood floors and benches add something unique to the setting. If you fancy the band, you can sit close. Or if you want some privacy, snatch up a corner spot.

A ski-lodgey pizzeria. This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit "weird" and "puzzling," make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.  Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?  DINNER:  Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered "All Day Happy Hour," I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their "Half and Half." The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time.   My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that.   Overall, the food is average "bar style" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options.   JUST DRINKS:  Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)  As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap!   Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle.   SO WHY GO?  Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)  If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!

Take Papago Park for what it is - a quick getaway in the middle of city life. Sure, it's close to the Zoo and Botanical Gardens. Heck, you could make an entire day of it - being outside, roaming, looking at interesting plant life. Only you can do so free of charge at Papago. Walk the paved trails or make your own. This is a perfect spot for a morning or mid-afternoon trek (as long as it's winter time) with somebody you like chatting with, like, let's say, a significant other.   Or maybe you want to grab your bike and take it on some trails. That's cool, too. I've seen many bikes roam throughout the park, often dotting the landscape along with casual hikers, dogs, park wildlife (including strange birds and hares) and families.   Truth be told, it's not what I think of when somebody says "park." You won't find swing sets or monkey bars here. But, the fun isn't had in man-made "toys." It's in mother nature. Besides, if you really need to climb on something metal, there are some old-time "exercise tasks" on the far West side of the park, past the golf course, near the condos off Van Burren. But, if you crack your skull open, don't say I didn't warn ya.

The decor is cool. I believe it's in the same location as The Gelato Spot. I say this since the main menu is focused on the sugary treat. But, that's not why I went in. I went in for iced coffee. YUCK. When I ordered an iced coffee, the cashier should have told me they didn't make 'em. Instead, he gave me hot coffee and a cup of ice. What? Uhm, that's not what I meant, bozo. Would I really want a hot coffee on an early June day? I don't think so, unless I'm just absolutely looney. I hear that's a possibility. In any case, the watered down coffee was gross.   That in and of itself is enough reason for me to grumble and moan about this place. It's doesn't deserve a second chance.

WOWZA.   Let me recount my first experience with Bass Pro Shops.   It was a sunny (typical!) afternoon. A Saturday. I was with my father and brother on our way to lunch. The destination: Cracker Barrel. It wasn't my choice and I won't begin to tell you how horrid the food there is. Let's just say it earned the moniker Crapper Barrel and will forever be known as the worst place on earth to eat.   Of course, if you've been to Mesa Riverview, you know that nearby the CB is this HUGE sporting goods store. Otherwise known as Bass Pro Shops. It was, of course, opening weekend.   My dad and brother dragged me inside.   Talk about retail meets theme park meets playground meets the wild outdoors. When you first walk in, you aren't sure what your eyes should settle upon. The flashy boats? The 4-wheelers? The huge fish tank? The gun room? The arcade games?   From sling shots to dog collars, we looked it all over. We even spotted a camo bikini. Absurd. I even mounted a couple 4-wheelers and pretended I was flying down the dunes. (It reminded me past years when I used to have a 4-wheeler at my disposal.) I also climbed in a boat and tried out the seats, imagining myself out on the lake, pole in hand. It was reminiscent of the many fishing trips I took with Gramps.  Between joking with my Dad and being in sheer bewilderment of the enormity of this place, I had fun. I hate to admit it, but it's true. From admiring the wood furniture to snapping a camera pic of a bull's testicles, I had fun! Granted, I don't so much attribute that to the store. I give credit where credit is due: to my father and his sick sense of humor.   I even managed to find some flip flops I convinced myself I needed. Now that's powerful marketing!

Words fail me.   Lucky me had my first-ever sampling of FT brownies last year around the holidays. The selection and temptations were so wide, I didn't know where to start. Whatever the choice, you can do no wrong when you bite into a FairyTale Brownie.   Seriously, if this is what fairy tales are made of, I hope my Prince Charming never shows up.

Ah, the Pho cup... full of steamy broth, basil, onion, chives, noodles, slow-cooked brisket and bean sprouts. Ah, how I love you. You give me warm feelings in my belly and you make me want to snuggle up for a nap. You are comfort food - so good!  But, give the Saigon Crepe some credit, too. What a way to kick start the meal. Yep, talk about an appetizer to surprise you with how good it tastes, especially dipped in the mildly spicy chili/vinegar sauce. Loved it! The standard Chinese beer (on happy hour price) hit the spot, too.   My belly was so full, it wanted to burst.

4.5 stars. I'd like to give Tea Infusion 5 stars, but I can't. I blame the location, for this refreshingly cool place gets lost among the retail stores at Tempe Marketplace. Tea Infusion would be a great off-the-street place to go. I can see it situated in the LGO or Central/Camelback Ave or Biltmore area. Or even tucked neatly off Mill Ave. If it were in any other place but Tempe Marketplace, I'd become a regular - especially because they have free wifi.  I ate lunch here today with a friend. We both commented on the striking decor - the soothing blue/gray walls and dark wood. There are even a couple of quotes painted on the walls, along with vibrant art hanging on display.   Tea Infusion also sells tea cups, mugs and tea pots. But is that really why you'd stop in? No. You'd stop in to sample the tea, check out the menu and wager if you'll like this place. At least that's what I did.   I like this place quite a bit, for the tea selection is large. From black to white to chai to oolong, you have many possibilities to satiate your tea appetite. I ordered a hot pot (two cups worth) of their chocolate mint chai. I also ordered egg, cheese and ham on an english muffin (from their breakfast menu, which is served all day). The tea arrived shortly with a little orange hour-glass, which is used to tell me when the tea is ready (3 minute seep is standard). Once the sand fell down to the bottom, I poured the tea into my glass. And I sipped. It was just the thing to offset the chilly afternoon.   My sandwich arrived later. It was just okay. I nibbled on it happily, though. My friend ordered the Tuscan chicken sandwich, which came with an artichoke sort of tapenade and a small splattering of goat cheese. She said the multi-grain bread was delicious. We both encountered a small problem though: our sandwiches wanted to fall apart. A piece of mine even leapt from the table onto the floor. Messy.   Being one of the few patrons there, we were able to relax, slowly drink our tea and enjoy a free-flowing conversation. Then it happened. A fresh, organic fruit tart appeared and we just had to have it. My friend quickly jumped up to order one for us. In order to make room in the display case, the girl behind the counter offered up a sampling of some chocolate truffle-like dessert. I gladly snatched up a sliver for us to try. And then we melted into the pleasures of fresh, organic fruit on top of a sweet custard surrounded by a flaky crust. There was also the bliss of the chocolate treat. "This would be absolutely perfect with coffee," I said. My friend agreed, for the chocolate dessert was the perfect amount of cream and cocoa to complement a cup of hot coffee.   I would recommend this place for a brunch or afternoon escape. While the lunch menu does offer up sandwich and salad options, I think you'd do better sticking with the obvious: the tea.

3.5 stars for a 5-star (almost) worthy place.  I have to take 1.5 stars off for location. Not that I blame them for jumping on the Retailopolis bandwagon. After all, after I'm done buying new tank tops at Old Navy, snatching make-it-yourself-floral fun from Michael's and convincing myself I can't live without this it's-too-random-to-be-true moose-head candelabra from Ross, I definitely have a hankering for wine. So, where to go... Oh yeah, World Market. While I'm there, let me pick up a selection of beers from around the world (I hear Holland has some good brew), browse the allegedly specialized food items and take a quick peak at their assortment of candles, smell-good bath things and kitchenware. But, let's face it, I go for the wine.  World Market suggests they sell things from around the world. While this is probably true (to a point), I both love and hate their wine selection (and I just plain hate how everything else takes up space that could be used for more wine). I love how their wines are divided by country and that you can find a really great wine for under $15 here. (Like Sexto from Spain) I just wish they had more! Yes, more wine! I said it. I want walls and walls of wine! A wall for Italy, a wall for Spain, a wall for Napa (it might as well be its own wine country)...   But, if my teeny tiny wish came true, they'd have to change their name from World Market to Wine Market (or Wine Heaven). Now, what would be so wrong with that?

I'll use the word "winter" loosely, for, you see, winter isn't winter to me without some sort of white falling flakes from the sky. Nor is it winter without some sort of annoyance, like scrapping frost off your windshield or slipping on the occasional ice patch. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't miss bruised tail bones or shivering to my bones while I wait for my car to heat up. I do, however, miss the change - the crispness in the air, the stark white backdrop to a new day, the trees bending under the weight of Mother Nature. I miss the cycle: life, death, rebirth, celebration.   Extract all that from my brain (my own frame of reference) and I'll agree: Phoenix is absolutely great between the months of December and April. May's not even that bad, but can you call May a "winter" month?   That's where I become disgruntled. You see, December weather in Phoenix is like fall weather where I used to live. October weather in Phoenix is like spring. I can't seem to keep track of my days here. Months cease to matter. I don't like that very much.   Add in the concept of "hot as ballz" during the summertime, and any months outside the range of absurdity are going to seem like pure bliss. But, c'mon, it's all relative.   Sure, I may rate "winter" in Phoenix 4 stars, but that's only because it's the only time of the year I don't feel like I'm drowning in my own sweat. It's the only time of the year I can enjoy walking outside, exploring Central Phoenix and other pockets of interest. It's the only time I can expect to need (hopefully) an umbrella (minus the scary monsoon season) or thicker jacket. Maybe even a scarf and gloves! It's the only time I will get to see my own breath, lingering long enough in front of my nose to remind me that, let's face it, these cooler temps are only temporary. What awaits around the corner is the worst kind of pain. Oh, the torment. Oh, the antagonizing sun. Oh, the hell that'll never end. Summer, how I rue thee!

Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest.   So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before.   But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station.   I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. "Wow," I thought, "It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."   So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it.   Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days.   Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off.   Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.    (Disclaimer: Said writer of review graduated high school with a 3.98 G.P.A  and attended a well accredited college of her choice, where you went on to graduate with honors, having made the Dean's and President's Honor roll more than once.

I second everything Max A said.   This isn't my type of place, although I didn't feel out of place here. I'm sure their target audience is a much more refined sort of person, with alot of expendable income. Plenty of "suits" came in, while I was partaking of delicious fare at the bar.   This place borders on "stuffy" when you see so many suits scattered around. It's almost like a hush-hush library vibe. Would one dare to laugh exuberantly here, or would you fear being shushed?   Don't get me wrong. The decor and atmosphere are gorgeous. Presentation is top-notch. The food is delicious and offers a new dining experience - atleast it did for me.   If you go, you MUST try the glass maze, made of shochu, lychee juice and ylang-ylang. It may be the ONLY reason I'd come back. That's not to say anything else is sub-par or bad. It's just, like I said before, not my type of place. Not even for a special occasion. I don't know. I get the feeling this place will be successful, though, considering the "type" of patrons I saw here. We even saw a Hillary Clinton look-alike in the bathroom. Not even a nod of acknowledgment. Not even a terse flip of the upper lip to feign indifference. Well then. I guess she didn't find my Paul Frank St. Patrick's Day shirt to be cute.   I wonder, though, if i weren't among Yelpers, if the service would have been as great? I wonder if I would have been treated with indifference and an air of causality reserved for house cats? Well, since I can't vouch for that (I only got the impression it would happen), I will give Roka Akor 4 stars. (I'm feeling generous after the Yelp event.)

Two times a year, you can meander down Mill Ave and the adjoining streets to look at an array of art for sale. Everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils, photography and abstract paintings.   If you go both in Spring and Winter, you're likely to see a few of the same artists. For the most part, Tempe Arts Festival does a great job of providing variety. Plus, it's fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before - let alone expected to see at an arts festival.   This isn't the most exciting of art festivals. There's really no live music, unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes.   I've been three times and enjoyed myself every time. I wasn't wowed. I never saw anything I couldn't live without. But, like I said, this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both Spring and Winter - even if it happens to rain during the festival.   I give last Winter's and this Spring's festivals both a 4-star review, for the weather and company were great. It was my first year going, and I was happy to see that Tempe offered the Valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art. After all, it's a "consumer" type of event, geared toward bringing the community and artists together. I can appreciate that.   I give this Winter's festival a 3-star review. The rain didn't phase me. I can deal with a few sprinkles. What bothered me was the mixing of ASU and UofA fans, both groups beginning to gather down on Mill Ave for the football showdown. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry. I just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans' excitement took over the relaxed, casual feel that the arts festival usually has - you know, when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section.   You see, fans were screaming in the streets - hollering insults to the other team - and waving their school's colors high. (Once again, I understand the fun of that. I just didn't expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon. Maybe I'm naive, though.) The fans were a definite distraction from the art festival. Knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation, my friend and I decided to bolt.   Lucky we did. Seems like Tempe can't handle a few rain droplets, for when we were walking back to the car, a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads. Talk about a commotion.   I'd much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts, no matter how dramatic both of those things can be.  I s'pose this echoes the old saying, "There's a time and place for everything."  Word to the wise: Parking can be hard to find, or require you to shell out $10 for a spot. If you can, park somewhere closeby that's free of charge and hoof it on foot.

Alas, I confess: this is my favorite Starbucks. Alas, I declare: this is the only one I pretend to like. Alas, it's true: I've been converted.   I used to hate Starbucks. You know, it was the "Big Man On Top" disgust. But, given some time, this Starbucks has won me over. Maybe it's the cute red head behind the counter who always flirts with me. Maybe it's the breakfast sandwiches, the relaxed atmosphere that sparks my creativity, the clever marketing pitches and the cheese platter with pesto jack and apple slices. Or, maybe, simply, it's the coffee - like the Christmas blend or the double espresso shot mixed with milk. Whatever it is, I'm a believer.   This Starbucks is about 2 miles from my office. It's my escape sometimes, my light at the end of the tunnel, my rescue from groggy mornings and afternoon fatigue. It is, let's face it, the only java mecca within a 5 mile radius.   Sure, Starbucks may still be the "Big Man On Top," but I'm okay with that, finally. I think they won me over with Bob Dylan tunes, casual flirtations and a hot peppermint soy latte. (Although there's some rebelliousness still that prevents me from giving this place 5 stars.)  Starbucks, I'm smitten with you. Act nice and gentle to me, please.

I'm basing this review on one thing (and one thing only): Coffee Talk, the coffee house I knew and fell in love with shortly after I moved to Arizona in 2006. A friend who grew up in Mesa told me about this local favorite spot. I could clearly see why: fantastic coffee, including matcha chai lattes, free wifi and open mics that brought out the very best of musical talent.   I remember fondly sitting inside while the cool spring breeze blew into the open windows. People were already gathered for open mic on an early Wednesday evening. I sat working on my laptop, enjoying a hot beverage.   Coffee Talk was THE place for me to go when I needed a break from rush hour traffic, thinking about to-do lists and contemplating my place in the world. When I was here, nothing could bother me. It was just me, the luxury of relaxation, with the company of java and music.  I miss Coffee Talk. I haven't been to Inside the Bungalow, the new endeavor now residing at 48 N Robson Street. I just don't think I can bring myself to go, although I'm sure I could be convinced. After all, I'm one helluva curious person.   Inside the Bungalow: http://www.yelp.com/biz/S-Hksc_Hh_dMEbiTWDnblQ

Rose and Crown, will you be my Valentine?   Be still my heart. I walked up to Rose and Crown with great anticipation, also knowing it had received some mixed reviews. I expected to be turned off. Instead, I was turned on. I really dig the rooms that are tucked to the side of the bar, which welcomes you with open arms once you step inside.   I was amused by the front door, too. It had a tiny little knob hiding from me. "How do you get in?" I thought at first. Then I laughed. Already I was amused and in a good mood.   So, once you're inside, you're staring at the face of the bar. Yep, it's right there. I imagine it can be a cluster on a crowded night, but when the place is relatively vacant, it's awesome to be able to walk up the steps, through the door and right into the arms of the bar. And it's not just any bar. There are plenty of options on tap, as well as by the bottle. A bar that carries Rogue is a bar I want to be at. Of course, they didn't have the Mocha Porter or the Hazelnut Brown, but I can always go to The Lost Leaf for that. Regardless, Rose and Crown carries a wide array of beers, from ales to pilsners to stouts. I was very, very happy to see Hobgoblin on the menu! As well as to know they do try and carry seasonal beers, including the new one from Sierra Nevada.  So, after you order your beer, you then have to decide Left or Right? If you move to the left, you walk into the "fun area," two rooms split between pool (one table) and two dart boards. This is also where you'll find the restrooms, past the two rooms and stashed in the back. This is also the way to the juke box and outside patio. To the right of the bar is the main seating area that is adjoined to another smaller room where R+C can set out food. Or, if there's no food to have, you can cozy up to the bar for the night.   I can definitely see how pinching your way through the crowd can be a hassle. I guess it depends on what kind of crowd it is. I don't mind rubbing shoulders and bumping elbows with artsy, laid back types. But, considering Rose and Crown is close to Pizzeria Bianco, AZ Science Center and alot of downtown offices, you could very well find yourself among posh-chasers and yuppies. Who knows. I'd have to go back on a regular weekday or weekend night to investigate that.

For a Saturday night, this place had a few select patrons - some even brave enough to sit outside in this absurd August heat. Not me. My friend and I parked ourselves at a table in the room with the pool table, where a couple of guys were playing and drinking pints with gusto. Fair enough.   Our server was quick to bring us menus and ask for our order. She was patient enough while I tried to decide what English beer I wanted to try for the first time. The draft and bottle menu is stupid - listing the beers but not the breweries or where they come from! That takes away all the fun! It's supposedly in alphabetic order, but they must not know how to place things in order, for the Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale was listed under the A's (as Arrogant Bastard Ale - I only know the brewery cuz I'm a beer aficionado these days), while other beers were listed by the breweries - Four Peaks, Sierra Nevada, Sam Smith...  I chose the Tetley's Ale. It was good! A slow sippin' beer, which is exactly what I needed. It hit the spot.  While my friend and I were enjoying our pints, our server came back to our table. "I got cut, so I was wondering if I could take care of your tab now. Then, for whatever else you may need, the bartender can help you guys." Well, okay. It must've been very, very, very slow for the one and only server to be cut. We paid her and continued our conversation.   Then my friend wanted another beer. But, we were never again spoken to by any staff. So, apparently, when the only server gets cut that translates to, "If you want another drink, march your happy arse up to the bar to order it."   Well, we didn't stay. For that reason and because it was so hot inside. They didn't have their A/C on, which makes me wonder if they have A/C at all. Ugh. I left with swamp ass. Seriously... that is NOT how I measure a fun time. It was my friend's first time here, and I think it's a sure bet that he won't be coming back based on the lack of service.    My friend and I quickly re-located to The Roosevelt for a superior experience and cooler (literally) atmosphere.

It wasn't love at first sight. Even with its charming atmosphere and interesting choice of decor, I wasn't convinced I could like this place. I had the mole. It was meh. I had some shrimp concoction. Just okay. It seems that whenever I'd eat here with family, I'd leave unsatiated and disappointed. I just didn't think Chilero's was my type of place, but my parents love it. They've made friends with the owners, so it's easy to see when I dine with them that my parents like this little neighborhood Mexican joint.   Today, however, I fell in love. Perhaps it was the company - everyone in great spirits - or perhaps it was that i took a good, hard look around and really began to appreciate Chilero's. Also, it didn't hurt that the food I ordered - the shrimp quesadilla with raspberry chipolte sauce on the side - was absolutely heavenly. Melting cheese and shrimp cozily placed between two tortillas. Mmmm. Every bite, dipped with my fingers into the sweet, savory sauce, was absolutely wonderful.   But, don't take my word for it. See what Get Out magazine had to say in June of '06: "Yes! The de la Cruz family - the talented group behind those addicting little tortilla chips and that delicious jalapeno-flecked carne asada served at both Mango's in Mesa and El Zocalo in Chandler - has opened its fifth restaurant and it's just down the road from my house. So stoked. The new Chilero's has the familiar Cruz flavors and is a big culinary score for this section of the East Valley, especially since they plan to serve agua frescas, arguably the most thirst-quenching liquid ever. Mole de pollo ($11.95), fajitas ($13.95), nachos ($8.95), chile verde ($10.95), tacos, tortas, burritos, sopapillas and flan make up the majority of the menu. The ordinary strip-mall shell looks great inside with its cappuccino and burnt orange walls, mud-set clay tile awnings, stained concrete floors, bright yellow open air ducts and shiny river rock archways. A liquor license is in the works." (http://www.getoutaz.com/story/285)

I need to make one thing clear: this place is good. Apparently my first review gave the wrong impression, as if I was unhappy with this place. Well, consider the 4-star rating then. That's good! And consider the 4-star rating now. Even better, considering I've been back several times!  You should check this place out if you're in the area. The service is fantastic, and you'll be supporting a local business. How refreshing.   There's something on the menu for everyone, including a tasty chilero salad for those watching their calories. I always order the shrimp quesadilla, though, with the side of raspberry chipotle sauce. It's addicting, and I find myself craving Chilero's from time to time. It's just one entree I'll never grow tired of eating... In fact, I'm craving it now!  Hey, the last time I went with the family, it was my suggestion to come here! So, yes, this is a great option for anyone in or near Mesa who likes Mexican food done well and served by friendly people who actually have a vested interest in the success of the business. You'll get top-notch service in a charming establishment. So go. Please. Support local businesses!

GO POKES!   Oh yeah, that's right. The sweet taste of victory!   Does the Insight Bowl really deserve 5 stars? Well, no. But my alum won, so giving this year's bowl any less would just be, well, worthy of a brutal beating. And I don't want that.  My date and I showed up at Sun Devil Stadium about 1/2 hour before kick-off. We easily found our seats and settled in to watch the team bands do their pre-game thing. Then my date went to fetch us some beer. That's when we learned there's an AZ state law that you can only carry 32 oz of frothy goodness at a time. So, we split a Fat Tire before the game.   Before the pigskin was tossed about, we had to endure some pretty weird activities, including military men parachuting onto the field, each carrying a flag and one carrying the game ball. Firecrackers exploded overhead to build excitement, I guess (although it got annoying really quickly when they'd fire 'em each time a team scored). Three military choppers flew by overhead. Was this really necessary? Of course not. After the smoke and 'cracker debris settled, a quartet sang the National Anthem. I think I would have preferred to hear Carrie Underwood, though. Uh, yeah. Seriously. At least she can sing.  Finally, OSU won the coin toss and the game was underway. I knew this wasn't going to be just any game... and sadly, I knew I was going to get annoyed by the people here, not to mention the fireworks.   Oh, the OSU fans were great. Even the Indiana fans were tolerable. It was two other groups of people who made this experience less than stellar for me. One was the family clans - those who attended the game just to have something to do. Those who brought their young children and allowed them to slap people in the back of the head with those air-up stick things. Those who took over our row and, when we took a bathroom break and got another beer, said, "Oh, you're back" in such a way that I wanted to smack 'em silly. Of course we're back. This is MY bowl game and you've taken over my seat, buddy. Did you really think I'd leave at the start of 2nd quarter? Now, move it!   Second group - and even more annoying - were the Sooners. I don't care that you're from Oklahoma. If you want to come to MY bowl game and semi-cheer on MY team, do it with respect. Don't prance around in your OU colors and start Sooner cheers. Don't tell me I can't do the standard touch down wave when my boys score. Don't tell me how to cheer. In fact, take your karma-sucking ugly asses out of the the stadium. You're not here to watch OSU win. You're here just to make your presence known, to try and overshadow the REAL Oklahoma state school. You're like the Yankees of college football. Nobody likes you, so leave.   Whew. (end rant)  So, how was the game, you ask? It was great! OSU had some great special teams, as well as really good defense and offense that allowed us to score 44 points! GO POKES! *does the Cowboy gun salute*  It was a fantastic way to spend the afternoon, especially on NYE. I never thought I'd get to watch my Cowboys play in a bowl game, but never say never! My wish came true! I wish I had been surrounded by OSU fans, though. I wish I could have heard the Cowboys band. I wish I could have remembered the words to the school songs! Argh! But, nonetheless, I'm really happy that I got to go to the Insight Bowl. I had alot of fun!   (And for all those people who may find my review unnecessarily harsh or rude, then you don't understand team rivalry and respect. But, that's okay. At least one of my Cowboys wasn't shipped home because he was caught shoplifting in Tempe at a Burlington Coat Factory!)

HAPPY HOUR 411: You'll get a damn fine deal if (and only if) you sit at the bar. I wish it weren't so, but with the specials they run, can you blame them? $3 Kirin? Really great roll and sashimi choices for $5? Great noshing apps and dishes at a low price? Uhm, yes. This is a terrific place for happy hour. Just be sure to get there early before it gets too packed. Happy Hour ends at 7 p.m.   * * *  MY DINING EXPERIENCE REVIEW:    Kabuki isn't a terrible place to eat, nor would I cringe at the thought of grabbing a large Orion at the bar - you know, just to hang out at the bar and drink (imagine that!). But, if you're a sushi elitist and you've had sushi in many cities in the U.S. and/or abroad, then you may not be impressed with Kabuki.   Sure, the decor is elegant, even typical of a newly opened place trying to become a hot spot. Nothing is off-putting about lounge music, their drink selection or the trendy atmosphere of a restaurant inside Tempe Marketplace. But... can they deliver quality fish?   Well, maybe. But, if you're not a fan of sushi, fret not. This has the largest "other" entree menu I have ever seen at any Japanese eatery. So, maybe you don't need to nibble one iota of sushi to like this place. But, I wouldn't know. I didn't go there for anything that was actually cooked.   Portions are generous. Their sashimi sampler is beyond munificent, for you'll be happy to feast your eyes on a gorgeous array of 5 different fish, including tuna, salmon, white fish and yellow tail, that each provide 4 to 5 thick pieces. PLUS (and this is huge), it comes with freshly prepared wasabi. No, it's not the green paste you're used to. It looks more like a cilantro mix. But, beware! While this wasabi may look pretty, it definitely packs a punch. Oh, how sweet it is...!   The nigiri is good, too. I had the mackerel (yum) and salmon. Again, the portions are generous. Downside is that there's only one unmarked soy container on the table, so you aren't given a low-sodium option. Tsk, tsk.   So, what about the rolls? There is a large menu to select from, for starters. You can even put a slight twist on the standard California Roll. As for me and the group I was with, we had rolls that consisted of lobster, soft shell crap, salmon, shrimp, avocado and smelt roe. Each piece was good! I'd definitely order the soft shell crap again, as well as the sashimi sampler with a couple pieces of mackerel.   So, does Kabuki know their sushi? I guess so. While sushi is always a must for me and while I tend to gobble up nearly any fish that is put before my face, I wasn't overly impressed with this place. Maybe I should blame the service. After all, we were never offered waters and our edamame was served COLD, like it had been sitting out in the kitchen for 2 hours. Ick.   But, they have Orion, the best damn Japanese beer you'll find. Of course, they offer only the large bottle at $9 a piece. Yet, their price for sushi is reasonable. After all, large portions split between 4 people (although we had a party of 6) came out to $28 a person. If you eat sushi on a regular basis, you know it's hard enough to feed you and another for under $50 - never mind the drinks you may order.   So, yeah, let's review the highlights: Good prices. Decent sushi. Yummy beer. Cool, down-tempo music.   So, as you can see this place teeters between good and not-so-good. That's why at the end of the day, I give this place a middle-of-the-road rating: Sushi Lover's Average of 3.5 stars.

Sashimi Bowl with a side of rice. That's all I gotta say. 5 fresh fish options, with generous portions of each, with the pure "hot stuff" (fresh wasabi, not the green paste) on the side. Yum. The eel and mackeral (ordered separately) are good too. Oh, and did I mention they serve Orion? Sweet!  ****  I've been back a few times for HH too. It's a great option if you're craving sushi and want to watch your budget. Alot of the options are spicier than I like, though, but they have something for everyone, it seems. Can't go wrong with $1.50 Kirin draft.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... sure, whatever. It's in the Tempe Marketplace, for cyin' out loud. Ok, so here comes my disclaimer: I wouldn't seek this place out. If I got a hankering for gelato, I wouldn't immediately tell myself to lace up my chucks and head to Mercato del Gelato, shopzillas be damned.   Fair? Fair.   However, since I happened to be in the area and it happened to be suggested we grab a sugary bite to eat, I can honestly say (given the aforementioned disclaimer) this place is oh so good.   From what I can tell, there's nothing that sets this little shop apart from the hoards of other gelato shops in the Valley. I figure the same creamy principles apply. Small spoons. Small cups. Gobs of samples. Pretty decent selection. People behind the counter ready to hand you tiny spoons full of samples, not to mention scoop your selections into tiny cups for savoring. So there. It's probably Generic Gelato, but I loved it nonetheless.  So, I'm not sure why I'm so defensive after giving this place 5 stars. They're probably smart cookies for setting up shop here, inside The District of Tempe Marketplace, where all that shopping sure makes you want a sugary pick-me-up. It certainly perked me up, especially after I discovered my new favorite flavor: hazelnut. I also discovered that you can split the cup and have two flavors in one. Brillant! So, I ordered my standard fave, pistachio, with my new fave, hazelnut, and I slurped up the gelato with my little orange spoon.

Uh, it's definitely an eye sore. Not to mention that all the construction tape and fences make the nearly impossible to find underground parking that much more difficult. Whew. I'm just glad I survived my trip downtown, managed to locate the entrance to the parking garage and handed over $4 for an hour + of my time that I'll never get back.  And for those of you looking for visitor parking, it's at the corner of Washington and 1st Ave (not Central, as I was told). Good luck!

Everyone in life has ambitions. I always wanted to be in tip-top shape; i just never thought it was possible. Until I moved to Phoenix. Until I met Austin and began to work with him. (I'm still a work in progress...)  I've never lifted weights before. But, now I can't hammer it home loud enough for women: weight training will change your body - for the better! Austin, my trainer, showed me that... the proof is easy to see when you stand before the mirror and see muscle definition, when you feel better about your body, when you walk with more confidence, and when your clothes start to fit differently.   Not that I was ever overweight. I was just carrying around a little extra insulation. And let's face it, you don't really need that in Phoenix.   So, I started training with Austin in Feb of 2007 and I haven't stopped. At Peak Performance, he challenges me. He devises the workouts and is happy to explain technique, the body's response, health, nutrition, the in's and out's of setting up different routines, the importance of stability, how to strength train, how to balance cardio with yoga... I can't even begin to explain how much I've learned. Nor did I ever believe I'd love working out with a trainer like I do. He knows his stuff and he seems to truly care about his clients. He likes to understand what motivates you so he can work with your best qualities. Even better, he wants you to learn, so that you can workout on your own and continue to see results.   For me, I'm an ex-athlete (will always be an athlete at heart) and he knows this. That's why he likes to mix up the routine and throw in some stability things, to improve my balance and let me escalate to more challenging workouts that top-notch athletes do to stay fit and on top of their game. I love it!   The gym itself offers a full range of equipment - plenty to go through an hour's workout and "feel the burn." There's enough that you'll never have to do the same ol' routine twice, if you didn't want to. But, you're not there on your own. That's what's so great. You're there with a trainer who knows the equipment, knows your goals, knows what motivates you, knows how to craft a routine that'll help you make progress (whether it's to burn fat, gain strength, work towards something realistic).   I really like this gym. The location is in the LGO area - kind of easy to miss, if you don't know what you're looking for, but there's a small marquee that says "Peak Performance Personal Training" before the entrance on the West side of 40th street JUST PASSED Campbell.  Why not give it a try? If you do, make an appointment with Austin. You won't be disappointed.

Brenda is great. I agree with John V. on that point.   Yet my experience was a tad different from his. Not bad or anything - just different. I'll explain.   I was treated very, very well, especially since I was a referral from John V. Brenda was very professional, thorough and attentive. My first visit was the standard consultation, though she took extra time to evaluate my needs and recommend a treatment plan. I went in to see about preventing migraines. She not only addressed that issue, but others as well. She said she'd work with me on my body alignment and neck tension, too. Awesome! For that, I was grateful. She knows her stuff!   She can be a tad hard to reach, but she always returns phone calls. I did notice that she gets a bit "sales-y" on the phone. She shouldn't try so hard. I'm smart. I believe in her therapy. I was sold based on John's recommendation. Yet, in one voice message, she told me to consider cutting down on my entertainment expenses so that I could put my body's health as a priority. I understand how she wants to get clients and help them - she has a genuine passion for this - but that sort of thing offended me. Honestly. I'm very much aware of my expenses, and if I didn't have to already pay my student, credit and medical loans, I would have definitely considered being on a payment plan that allowed me to get the treatment I wanted.   Unfortunately, she doesn't accept my insurance (Humana), so that presented a problem. Brenda was more than willing to work with me on a payment plan. But, my financial situation didn't allow for me to devote myself to a 3x weekly visits at $125 each, which is the out-of-pocket cost per session. Ouch.  Let's see...  3 x 125 = $375! That's a helluva lot of money. Yes, my health is worth it, but I wish I could have used my insurance here. That became a make-or-break factor. (Besides, I don't even spend $375 a month on fun things, let alone spend that in a single week on "entertainment.")  375 x 4 = $1500 a month... Wow. There's absolutely no way I can afford all that out of pocket. Too bad. Because I would have stuck w/ the program, as recommended, until I was coming to see her once a month and doing stretches and exercises on my own, at home. She's very good at showing you exercises that'll benefit your overall health.   I got to be honest. After my appointment with her, I felt energized. Later that night, I realized the hour I spent with her took so much out of my body. I guess I had been holding onto alot of "toxins" and tension. I crashed. Too bad. That was the night Donald Glaude and DJ Dan played Mist. If anything, though, it showed me how effective her sessions can be, which made me really want to stick with the program. Arrgh. If only money wasn't an issue!  So, here's the bottom line: If you have the right insurance or can afford treatment, GO! You won't be sorry. After all, it's your health we're talking about here. Brenda is really great. Like John said, she combines physical therapy with a holistic style. Plus, she's certified to address ergonomic issues, too, which can often lead to people's problems, if not corrected. She even does company consultations to examine employee workstations.   Parting thoughts: You may need to get a referral notice from your doctor. I did. My doc had no problem referring me to the PT I wanted to see. But, you may want to check with your Doc before you go. Oh! And give Brenda a call to see if she takes your insurance! It just may be your deciding factor, too.

Geisha A No No. That's its real name. Didn't you know?   Contrary to what the Phx News Times said in an online review, this place does not open for lunch. Imagine our disappointment, for a trio of hungry co-workers had been planning a lunch escape to this location for quite some time. (What can we say except domo arigato, mr. roboto.)  Uhm, the door was unlocked, though. Just as we began to pull it open, thinking they had just opened for lunch, a man in a gray t-shirt approached.   "Hey, we're not open."  "We read an online review that you were open for lunch." "Nope. We've never been open for lunch." "Oh..." "Come back for happy hour. We open every day at 5." My co-worker checked his watch. "That's only 5 hours from now. Thanks."  And then he walked off. No "thank you." No "let me tell you about your other options in the area." Nothing. He just walked toward the back of the business. Must be the owner or manager. I would think that if patrons (attempted ones at that) were trying to check out your place, you'd at least paste on a smile, stop to tell them about the area and welcome them back for dinner, with a complimentary app. But nope.   Believe me, I've seen their HH menu and it sucks. Tempura everything. Sure, load me up on fried foods. Of course the interior is pleasing. I love the idea of green walls. But I will not be coming back here.   I don't know how they stay in business. They must offer other "services" behind closed curtains in their private rooms.

The Mission, if we chose to accept it, was to find the wine that "felt like a circus in your mouth." Who wouldn't want to take up this task? We certainly decided it was a worthy cause. At 8:45 p.m. on Saturday, we pulled up to the brand new BevMo in Tempe Marketplace. When we slipped past the sliding doors, my date let out an excited observation, "This must be what heaven is like."   We began to walk down the middle of the store, where boxes of wine on sale separate the store into two - on your left is the beer and wine; one your right is the alcohol, mixing ingredients and glass ware. We veered to the left. I walked slowly down the beer aisles, looking at each one, my curiosity piqued. I become very excited to see three offerings from Breckenridge Brewery (the Avalanche being my favorite), as well as a few choices from Rogue Brewery - wow! They even had the Hazelnut Brown! Yes, maybe this was heaven after all...  My date found the bottle of wine and, upon the prompting over the PA system, decided it was time to leave. I held back, considering buying some brew. I finally decided to pick up the Avalanche Ale to keep us company while watching the Oscars.   My date joked with the store manager about BevMo points - enough will earn you a free kidney or liver. I was surprised they didn't bag my beer, for I was under the impression it was state law (at least that's what somebody told me once at AJ's). In any case, we paid for our heavenly libations and walked out of the store - only to see a handful of well-manicured women walking up to the store front. "Sorry, we're closed," the young man at the front said to them. I stopped. "But, look at them. They're so pretty." And they were. My date remarked, "C'mon, she's got a crown on." The young man asked what they wanted. Turns out the young beauty in a shimmering gold dress (and crown) was turning 21 that night. Just one drink, is what they said they wanted. The young man obliged. We left smiling, thinking we had done a good thing by helping to persuade the young man to let them into the store. I mentioned the timing of the situation, how us being there at the right time allowed the 21 year-old to have a fun birthday. My date, always so witty, said we probably aided in the woman getting so blitzed, she'll get knocked up. Either way, we decided she was going to have a great night!   As for the circus in our mouths, we picked up a Cab that was really, really, really good. Now, I'm no wine expert. And I certainly don't know anything about the circus. But I can see why somebody would say the wine was like a circus in his mouth - acrobatic flavors with a strong finish. Very nice... It reminded me of a poem I read back in college. All I can remember are my favorite lines. They go something like this: "I've been in your body/And it was paradise/I've been in your body/And it was a carnival ride."   BevMo, I love you.

You can pig out here, and they won't squeal. How do I know? That's what their t-shirts say. But, if you don't want to feast on the pig, you have other options, too, like beef, chicken and fish.   The decor is fun, especially if you're among a hard-to-please crowd that is a mix of a) those who like to try new things and b) those who like the tried and true.   I'm told what makes Famous Dave's so famous is their BBQ sauce. Honestly, I wasn't impressed with any of their sauces, although it was fun for our waiter to explain each one, then draw the first letter of the sauce's name on a plate - easy for us to sample!   I flipped through their beer menu and was really happy to see they have Alaskan Amber Ale on tap, as well as Sam Adams. In the bottle, they have other varieties, like Red Stripe. I have to admit, for being a franchise, this place offers up a beer selection that's hard to beat (for your Average Joe destination).  The Alaskan Amber was the highlight of my day, for it was served ice cold in a chilled glass. Perfection! It went really well with the salmon I ordered, along with one of the best cornbread muffins I've had!   While I didn't finish my entree - I found the green beans to be too cold and bland and the salmon to be just "meh" - I did find delight in 3 things.   1. Alaskan Amber Ale on tap 2. Cornbread Muffin 2. Warm apple chutney on the side  Would I go back here? Yes, I definitely would, even if it's in Mesa RiverHell Marketplace.  Famous Dave's is a sure compromise for my family. I can drink the beer. They can eat the BBQ. My dad even said he'd give this place a 5-star rating.   So, in summary: This place is a family-pleaser, and I can't refuse any invitation to partake of the 3 aforementioned treats!

After munching on brunch delights at Bada Boom Pasta Room, my comrad had a splendid idea. "Let's hop on this trolley and see where it takes us!" Uhm, why not? So, we rode the trolley on its route, which included areas around downtown Scottsdale. It was fun, I'll admit. I never thought it would be, but you can sit in a comfortable air conditioning trolley car as it lurches to and fro. It does occasionally stop, with the driver confessing, "We'll be stopped here for 5 minutes, then be on our way again." I can't imagine what it'd like to drive the same route over and over and over again... But I'm sure you can have some fun talking with guests, who may be visiting Scottsdale and no little, if anything, about the place.   I just love the idea of public transportation, especially if it's free.   After riding for a little bit longer, my comrad and I hopped off at Cafe Carumba for some espresso. Then we took our drinks and walked the length of the Mondrian Hotel. We were drawn to the pool area, where it looked like a scene right out of a movie. Bronze beauties and muscular men all bathing in the pool. A DJ was playing music and misters offered reprieve from the summer heat. This was, after all, July in Scottsdale.   I think you can easily make a day out of touring the area, especially when you can hop on and off the trolley. It's so easy!   * * *  Trolley Schedule:  Every 10 minutes  7 Days a week  11:00 am to 9:00 pm  No Trolley service on New Years Day,  Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day,  Thanksgiving or Christmas.   The Scottsdale Trolley is free to ride,  (drivers may not accept tips), and visits :   Scottsdale Fashion Square  Fifth Avenue Shops  Marshall Way Arts District  Main Street Arts District  Old Town  Waterfront  SouthBridge  Scottsdale Convention & Visitors' Bureau  To see a map of all the routes and stops, click here: http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/trolley/downtown_route.asp

Josh, our server, took great care of us today during lunch. He was so friendly and helpful.   I wanted to order the seafood guac without the guac. He went and asked the chef if this was possible. Yes, it certainly was, and it would only cost me $5. So I ordered that - happily - with the side of black beans with orza for $2.   YUM!   There was more than enough for me to finish, but every mouthful was delicious.   I still think this place is a little over-priced. They didn't offer us a lunch menu; instead, we had to choose from their main menu. BUMMER. So, if you're looking for a lunch deal, you're out of luck here, though I did manage to have a hearty lunch (still feel full 5 hours later) for under $10!  This time around I found the service was more than accommodating today. Definitely 4 stars! I still love, love, love the atmosphere and decor!   (I left a "You've Been Yelped Card" at the table. Booyah!)

An update to an update? Is that possible???   Well, Maria Maria deserves it. Again, great service. But what I'm most impressed and happy with is what I ordered: the spinach, shrimp and mango salad. YUM! Just be careful if spicy isn't your thing, since the 4 large shrimp seem to be smothered in spicy powder. Next time, i'll ask for "naked shrimp," since the other ingredients of the sald, including cojita cheese and raisins, add such an array of flavor, you really don't need the spicy element.   It's a $13 salad (yeah, I cringed at this, but I've been wanting to try this forever), but totally worth it. It was so hearty, I took 1/2 home. Double yum!

If I ever move again, I know who I'm gonna call. Camelback Moving is the BEST moving company I have ever used. In fact, I've used them twice to move locally in Phoenix. They were so great the 1st time, I didn't once think of using anyone else for my 2nd move.   When you call to set your appt, they are professional, efficient and thorough. They don't mind fielding your questions and will be honest with you about their scheduling. I found out that you can save money if you move on a weekday, as opposed to a weekend. Their weekends fill up fast, too.   When you make your appt, you're walked through the process. What they book for you depends on how much stuff you're moving and the layout of your current residence versus your new one. For example: 3 flights of stairs means higher cost, due to booking an extra set of hands.   When you make your appt, you're given an hour time frame in which to expect them at your place. Maybe it's 8 or 9. Either way, this is the most punctual moving company I've ever used.   A couple days before your move, you get a a reminder call. The day of your move, you get another call from the actual "moving men" to let you know they're on their way over to you. The 2nd time I moved, they were even early - by about 1/2 hour.  The guys that show up to help are GREAT: friendly, polite, hard-working, fast and even lighthearted. Who knew? On the plus side: Not creepy whatsoever. So ladies, no worries when you got to move by yourself, like I did.   Honestly, if you need to move, give these guys a call. I've moved over a dozen times in my life, and I can vouch that these guys are the real deal. They even take great care of your personal items - wrapping things in blankets and/or bubble wrap. I was very impressed!

This place is GREAT!   Talk about a divine menu and vino list.   Their scallops are superb, and their cheese tray - that includes a local honey - is top-notch.   The only thing that would make this place beyond stellar, is a few additions of comfy chairs and high-back lounge seats. It would take this place from restaurant to chic lounge.

Long. Wavy. Short. Edgy. No matter what you want, you'll get it here. Yet, be forewarned that you should communicate very clearly to the stylist. When I first went, I took a photo, had a conversation with the stylist and walked out with what I deemed a Peter Pan style. I didn't want that much cut off. It's the only time in my life I ever cried over my hair. What's worse, the stylist said, "It's going to get hot here. You'll thank me later." Nevermind I didn't want my hair buzzed short. Ugh, the audacity...  That royally pissed me off. Yet, after another failed salon visit at a popular place in Scottsdale, I went back to Mood Swings, asking for another stylist. This time, I was clear, firm and blunt. Luckily, I got a stylist that listened to me, that looked at any pics I brought in, that talked about layers, trim and so forth. She even takes the time after styling to talk about how I like it. Do I want more off? If so, she happily obliges. Do I want more texture? No problem.   Mood Swings is now my salon of choice. The location is great, right off Mill Ave. They validate parking. They offer you refreshments when you arrive. The atmosphere is ripe with artistic appeal and pizazz. They support the local art community and are pro-green. What more could you ask for? Well, to top it off, you get a relaxing hand massage with your hair rinse... and the ladies can enjoy a touch of make-up on their way out the door. Perfecto!  The price can be pretty steep, depending on what you do. But, for cut or color, I recommend this salon. I also recommend Jessica Divis (my stylist) or Kristina. I've been very pleased with both.

Two Words: Rosemary Mint.   Yes, please. I'll take the hand and body soap, as well as the lotion and shampoo! And while I'm at it, can you throw in some Sap Moss shampoo and voluminizer? Thanks. Oh, and don't forget the oils you have - ylang ylang, sandalwood, lavendar. I'm gonna need some of those, too.   Oh, you like my hair cut? Thanks. I just got it done upstairs - at Mood Swings. Oh, that reminds me. Add Pure Abundance Hair Potion to my cart. I love me 17% extra body. What? You have Voluminizing Tonic and Phomollient Styling Foam? Throw that in there, too. Love that stuff!  Oh, hell. Who am I kidding? I'll just give ya my Visa.  Do I get a discount for maxing out my card here?

There's not a lot on the menu for someone who is gluten-free, vegan, or both. I'd recommend getting the fries - yum! - and the spinach/avocado salad that comes with smoked beets.   Oh, and the beer -- great list which includes local and regional craft beers you may not be able to get anywhere else, let alone on tap!

Drop the convenience and you got yourself an all-start liquor store. For some reason, walking in and seeing bags of chips, slim jims and shampoo does nothing for me. So, going forward, I shall call this place "Star Liquor Store." And what better name to have on Yelp, eh? Especially when the booze selection earns 5 Yelp stars.   I'll un-cap (get it?) the star-worthy appeal: +They sell the White Chocolate Ale from a local AZ brewery (it's amazing) +You can pick up a single pint glass or beer mug (wine glasses too) +They carry Rogue and most all other major West coast breweries +Their wine selection is impressive and they have liquor too! +Their prices are competitive and cheaper than BevMo  This is fast becoming my fave spot to stop. You won't have to fight the noise or crowd of Papago to pick up a 6-pack. And the owners are super nice with excellent service.  Check out their site: http://www.starlc.com/

Hotel el Ghetto, that's what this place is. It doesn't deserve even one star - unless you feel generous and grant it a single rating for having a basic roof that keeps you dry (for the most part).   Also, they lie. There is no free wi-fi in the room. You have to be physically in the lobby to pick up a signal, and then you're lucky if you can stay connected for longer than a minute.   Imagine my chagrin when a visiting friend opened her hotel door last night. Never mind the musky and rank stench in the elevator and hallways. Never mind the stale air in the room, or the sound the bed made when you sat down - like leather pulling apart. Never mind the girl at the front desk who had long, fake nails, each one painted a different color and adorned with stars. Look past the fact that they have on-site police officers to "protect the community." What you'll find here is nothing short of ghetto-tabulous.   I imagine this is where whores come to die.
