This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in the EV now it's a great shame. Menu has changed slightly but the quality is on serious decline!

This place is an "old school" Mesa staple that is always packed... with white people, go figure. That should've been the first red flag to walk out. However after years of avoiding this place I was caught in moment of weakness and proximity. Bad decision. Disgusting!    Sent back two plates. One was cold and the other was a disaster, like someone threw up on my plate. I just walked out. El Charro needs to change its name to El Chafa or El Chorros.

This place is as good as it gets. The facilities are clean, the staff is friendly and the workouts are challenging. We decided to become members of Precision because our kids.  This is the best program a child can get into if you are trying to improve their self-confidence, personal discipline and respect for others. It nice hearing your 1st grader say "Yes sir!" when you ask him to do something.

Disgusting!  Frozen deep fried trash. This place may be old and a community staple, but the foods is not good. At all.

Places like this are USUALLY a dime a dozen in Mesa, not this place. Best authentic Mexican food around, no joke! If you don't like it, I'll buy your meal!

Dime a dozen. Thought that with the high Yelp ratings it would be good, it's below average. Worst part was service. No one seems to be able to make any decision without talking with someone first.

Best asada on the planet. They use prime beef and the freshest ingredients. I eat here 3-4 times a week. I won't eat another taco in Mesa.

No hassle. Excellent same day service. Finished repairing my iPad's broken screen within 2 hours. Once completed they even dropped it off to my house for free! Quality workmanship. Highly recommend this young entrepreneurs!!!

I really wanted to like this place. A friend did their promo video and recommended it to me.   Price was okay for quantity but quality was seriously lacking. I got "everyone's favorite" green chile beef burrito. Flavor was okay but the beef/chile was like pure aide gravy inside a tortilla. You couldn't even identify what was inside. Not good a start.  I can understand and appreciate creativity but if you're going to mashup two culinary concepts (BBQ & Mexican) into one it needs to be exceptional, not mediocre.   I don't know if it's a Mormon cultural thing due to too much jello and casseroles, but poor choice in local cuisine is not uncommon in Mesa. And based on the high reviews here, most of the reviews have to be coming from the same people that have had their palates desensitized by Pete's and El Charro their entire lives.
