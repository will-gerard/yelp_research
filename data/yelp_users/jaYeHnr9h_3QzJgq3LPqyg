Fridays are our date night and I must say I was extremely happy with our choice of restaurant. Houston's at the Esplanade has been a favorite of ours for years, but last night confirmed our feelings once again. After being told that the wait would be 15 minutes, we decided to go out to the patio and order our drinks. Less than 5 minutes later we were seated at our table. Impressive already! Our appetizers were wonderful! I didn't like artichoke until last night! Total Yum! My husband had the usual, the Pork Ribs and loved them.  As for me, I had the Grilled Halibut and couldn't be happier! The freshness and quality of my dish was to die for! I love Houston's!

So, my husband and I went out for Sushi last night. We tried to get into Yasu, but it was just too busy. I'll blame it on the fact that it was Good Friday. Anyhow, we decided to give Shogun a try.   We entered the restaurant and was quickly shown to the sushi bar. The atmosphere was chill and relaxing. We had the Caterpillar Roll and loved it! The tuna shashimi was fresh and tasty! We even had some quail eggs and Saki.   After finishing our roll, we realized that we lost track of time and had to get tot a birthday party in less than 25 minutes. The chef canceled the last roll and put a rush on our bill. We were able to get out in less than 5 minutes. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and FAST. We will most definitely visit Shogun again!

Nice establishment. BAD customer service! Margarita the owner was not helpful to my needs!  I visited Body Therapy with my mother and my sister 2 days before my wedding. Everything was wonderful until they got to my manicure/acrylics and pedicure. Lets just say it was UGLY! The worst acrylics I've ever seen. Not exaggerating! When I asked to get my nails redone I was told "I've been in business for 28 years. If you need to get your nails redone just make sure to bring me your receipt and I'll give you a free manicure and pedicure." I cried all the way home! Everyone I showed my nails to felt sorry for me and said it was a bad job (including my husband). For the next 2 days I was completely embarrassed!  In such little time I couldn't find the time or place to get my nails redone. Trust me, I tried! So what did I do? I spent the next two days ripping off my nails just to put press-ons on an hour before my wedding. No I didn't go back with my $6.99 receipt. I just decided to not go back at all!  I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! ZERO STARS!

So eight of my friends and I planned a night out on the town starting with Oregano's on Scottsdale Road and Shea. This plan changed as we all grew tired of waiting in the parking lot just to get seated! We waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes! Now that's ridiculous! We love Oregano's pizza but when we are all starving and wanting to get our night started we decided to look elsewhere. We looked across the way and there we saw NYPD Pizza. We were ushered in 15 minutes later.   The service was fast and great. The food was very yummy! We all chose different entrees and shared tastings.  OOOhhh.....Garlic Knots.....need I say more. Thanks to NYPD Pizza our night was soon back on track.   To make things better we ran into such a nice man who was a total gentleman to us all. He even held the door open for all of us as we were leaving the restaurant. Who was he?. . . Charles Barkley. ( LOL...I know) Besides the whole Charles Barkley thing we would most defiantly go back and visit this NYPD Pizza. It's much better than waiting nearly 2 hours just to get seated.

I visit Autumn Court at least once every other week, usually on Fridays. The happy hour is great and my husband loves the Pad Thai! Service is wonderful and our favorite bartender is one that we can call a friend! This is one place everyone has to try at least once.

I've been a fan of Hazelwoods for years!   I love the Greek Salad. But they never seem to put enough red onions on the salad. I always have to ask for extra red onions. (that's just my opinion) The Ruben Sandwich is very yummy! If you like sauerkraut, they put extra on this sandwich.   Now, I've never had one of their burgers until last night. I seriously think I hurt myself! We started off the night with a $5 Kiltlifter mug and then ordered dinner. The 1st Place Burger and french fries was a big helping! I was able to eat 90% of my plate! Since I live 100 yards from Hazelwoods we always walk. The walk home was hurtful! I don't think I'll have the burger again. It was delicious don't me wrong, it was just too much for me.   On another note, Hazelwoods has some of the best Garlic Chicken Wings around! I defiantly recommend Hazelwoods to any and everyone!

Though we went to Eddie's House for happy hour and not dinner I can say it was delicious and very reasonably priced! All apps. were 50% off and they were served up quickly! Customer service was extremely quick and accommodating. We will defiantly be going back soon to try dinner. Thanks Chef Eddie Matney!

My sisters and I went to Hanny's for my birthday this past weekend. After reading multiple reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I was a little concerned and not sure if I wanted to go to Hanny's after all. We walked in about 10:00pm and the restaurant was busy! We were instantly ushered to our table. Nice! Our waitress was great and our food was delicious and quickly served. $5 martinis??? Heck Yeah! We're going back this weekend!

Flesh Fest!! If you love meat, you'll enjoy Fogo De Chao.   Our fist encounter with Fogo De Chao was in Houston a couple of years back. We were both impressed with the service and the food. Since then we have visited Fogo De Chao in Scottsdale and have loved every minute of each experience.   My husband and I came here for our first year anniversary. We made the mistake of eating a huge breakfast at Bill Johnsons Big Apple. One shouldn't do that if you plan on going to Fogo De Chao.   For New Years Eve we again visited Fogo De Chao with some friends. Service has been impeccable all three times we went (both in Houston and in Scottsdale). Our wine and water glasses were never empty and our table was always clean. The wait staff were kind and always remembered our favorite cuts of meat. The Lamb Chops are my favorite. The Bacon Wrapped Fillet Mignon is to die for!  I am a definate fan of Fogo De Chao!

Frank's Deli has been in the same spot for decades. Growing up in the neighborhood I remember their subs. Yesterday I visited Frank's and I was in pure heaven when I was eating my New York style sub. The area has changed since I was a kid.  It's a little sketchy now but have no fear it's worth it!
