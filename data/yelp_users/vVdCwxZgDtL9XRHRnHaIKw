Top sirloin for $7?  With a microbrew beer, mashed potatoes, and green beans?  That's a damn good deal.  Granted, the beer isn't great, but it is decent.  The green beans aren't the best made, but definitely suffice.  The mashed potatoes aren't spectacular, but they're definitely tasty.  But the steak is well made, juicy, and totally worth it.  Even if it was $10, I'd buy all that.  Next time I hit Vegas and I haven't won a jackpot, I'm going here!

Sucks!  Why did it take an hour to get our food?  Why did people's orders get out of order?  It was probably a bad day, but they did nothing to make us want to come back and see how a potentially normal day is there.  The food's ok.  One a positive, I actually got to hear a black guy from one group of people tell another black guy in another group have this exchange:  "Hey, that's nacho cheese!"    "Yeah, that's what I ordered"  "Yeah, but that's not yo's.  It's my nacho cheese!"  And the whole restaurant burst into laughter.  I never thought I'd ever hear that happen in real life in front of me.  That's the only reason I 'm glad I went here.  Still, screw this place.  I'm going to Jack In The Box up the street next time.
