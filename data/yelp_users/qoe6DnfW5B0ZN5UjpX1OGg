Great food and great service!  Having just moved into a new building for work, this hidden gem was an amazing find.  They serve Breakfast and Lunch, and everything thus far has been fabulous.  I have a pet peeve when it comes to the bacon I get for breakfast and these guys cook it fresh!  Their soups, salads, sandwiches and pasta are all fresh.  They use fresh baked bread, with fresh ingredients.  Even if you don't work in the building, if you're nearby - stop in.  It'll be worth it!

It doesn't get any better than this!  Several months ago I had a dental emergency on a Saturday and they were the only Dental office that was open nearby.  They got me in right away and were able to fix the problem immediately.  The entire staff were so professional, friendly, and fun, that I immediately changed dentists and have never gone anywhere else!  They always take the time to go over every part of the procedure and provide a breakdown of the proposed treatment plan including a cost estimate.  Seriously, the entire staff is amazing!  Always friendly.  Always fun.  And always there to make sure everything goes smoothly.  Even if you have another dentist you need to come in to Dr, Hodges office and see for yourself.  I'll bet you switch just like I did!

Always a fan of Mimi's!  Sorry it took so long to write this review.  No matter which location we visit, the food is always top notch!  Breakfast is our family favorite and the pain purdue is too good for words!  I get a patty melt for lunch whenever I can and they do it up right everytime!  Try it on grilled sourdough bread with their signature honeymustard - dip the patty melt in the dressing and .................YUM!  Service is always great and we'll be there again this weekend!

If you haven't been to CPK lately, then you are missing out!  They have revamped almost every aspect of their menu, while keeping the favorites intact!  Everything from their silverware to serving plates, to glassware has been upgraded.  And while the service has always been great, they have stepped it up a notch!  There are too many new things to try to mention here, but my personal favorite is the Cedar Plank Salmon with Corn Succotash.  Their pizzas have always been great, but they have found a way to improve them.  For example;  the Hawaiian pizza now comes with giant slices of pineapple instead of small chunks.  And the kids favorite Mac & Cheese is still as good as ever.......I always sneak a few bites off their plates!  The Avocado Spring Rolls are a meal in themselves, as are several of the other recent additions to the appetizer menu.  CPK is definitely on top of our list of family favorites.  And I am not sure how ling this is going to last......but they are validating parking at the Chandler Mall!

I drove to Joe's after seeing the "Southern Fried Maine Lobster" commercial and now wished I would have stayed home and made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  What you see in the commercial [lots of lightly breaded lobster] is absolutely not what you get......Sure, if you enjoy dragging a mound of overly seasoned breading through equally over-seasoned butter, then go nuts!  But if you are looking for lobster, you'll need to go "Indiana Jones" on your plate of food...... and if you're really lucky, you'll find lobster...............but only the tips of the lobster claws and a few random claw knuckles.  I 'dug' through two plates [I sent the 1st one back] and after an exhaustive effort, came up with maybe 3 ounces of actual lobster surrounded by over a pound of breading.  The mac & cheese was good, as was the corn, but you will not find a more cut-and-dried case of  bait and switch anywhere [pun intended].  So if you are looking for lobster......look somewhere else.

Sorry guys - not a fan.  We tried Brunchies for breakfast and were dissappointed at almost every level.  It was a Sunday and not too busy so the service should have been better [faster].  The over-easy eggs were over-hard and had to be sent back.  THe bacon was obviously pre-made and cold.  By that time the kids had finished their pancakes and my wife had stopped after eating only half her meal.  Our drinks were never refilled and we only saw our server when the order was taken and when the bill was dropped off.  We may give them another shot, but it is doubtful.

Extremely happy with Chandler Auto Body!  If/ when you need repairs, this is the place you should go!  My 2002 Avalanche had suffered sun damage to two of the doors and front fender and they did a remarkable job matching he paint.  They even took care of the pin stripping at no extra charge.  The vehicle was clean inside and out, including the tires and rims.  It's the little things that count and they went over the top.  The price was very competitive and their communication was excellent.  Overall, a world class customer experience.  When I need repairs in the future, they will be my first, and only choice.

DOWN UNDER POOL CARE is the only pool service you will ever need!  We went through 3 or 4 companies before finding Down Under Pool Care almost 7 years ago and have never.....EVER had a single issue with our pool since finding them.  With year-round service, our pool is ALWAYS in pristine condition and ready for use.   Honestly,  it doesn't get any better.  Anyone can say they clean pools, but DOWN UNDER POOL CARE delivers 5 STAR service on a consistent basis.  And not just cleaning, but repairs and other pool-related services.  We have recommended them to anyone we know that has a pool and will never use anyone else!

Absolutely top notch!  Had to have a root canal on a molar that had also been crowned and they were awesome.  Friendly, courteous, professional.....and most of all - no pain!  ZERO!  If you need work done, get it done here!

Wade  was a great guy who was not only professional, but knew his business. He was quick and courteous and after he pointed out the bad rollers it was easy to see that they needed replacement.  He took the time to explain every step of the repairs and we could not have been happier with the results!

WOW!  How did we not find this place sooner?  This little out of the way cafe in Old Chandler is worth driving to from anywhere!  Their signature breakfast dish, 'The Morning Monte' is to die for.  This French Toast masterpiece is made with Hawaiian bread, egg whites, grilled turkey, havarti cheese,and bacon, served with a spicy chili marmalade.  The meal stands on its own, but the marmalade or syrup is great too!  There was no wait when we arrived, and the service was excellent.  There is a patio that resembles a small forest, and while we ate indoors, it was still quite 'cozy'.  This is our new favorite breakfast place!  We'll be back again very soon!

Very disappointed with everything from the food to the service.  I took my daughter for dinner and they were not very busy so I am not sure what happened.  The fettuccine was barely warm and when I asked if I could get shrimp with it, the shrimp was served in a cold bowl on the side.  My daughter ordered pasta with a simple butter sauce and it too was served barely warm and the pasta was severely under cooked.  No one refilled our drinks, no one checked on our meal, and at one point I timed how long it took for our waiter to come back.  It was 17 minutes.  He was more concerned with the larger parties he had nearby, working the larger tip I assumed, than us.  When he asked how everything was, and I told him, there was no offer of any kind to make up for the sub-par food or the lack of service.  He simply replied "I am in the weeds."  The best part of the meal was the bread.

Another fantastic meal at Coach & Willie's!  Not only are you surrounded by large flat-screen TVs to watch the games, the food is equally incredible.  We have been there 5 separate times now and I have personally ordered 5 separate entrees, and each was amazing!  Tonight the rib-eye coupled with the lobster bisque was equaled only by the incredible service we received from 'Ife'  [pronounced "E-Fay".........he was friendly and was always there when we needed something.  Honestly - I have never been to a 'Sports Bar' where the food was on par with a fine dining restaurant.  Truly amazing!  You must try this place!

You don't need to call anyone else for your sprinkler issues.  These guys are the best.  Eldon [the owner] showed up right on time [actually early] and was able to identify and repair the problem in about an hour.  Honest, friendly, and inexpensive.  The Sprinkler Doctor has my business for life!

Top Shelf Sushi and staff!  Our family eats there twice a month and the kids love it.  The teryaki chicken and chicken strips for kids are devoured every time.  We know the staff by name and they interact with us and the children which makes for a very pleasant dining experience.  The Sushi is awesome and they have their own unique and fantastic rolls.  We don't go anywhere else for Sushi!

WOW!  2 for 2!  We stumbled on this new pizzaria a few weeks ago and fell in love with not only the food, but the staff!.  The pizza's are pretty much 'create your own' and the toppings are endless.  We had an Artichoke Heart, Basil, Sausage, and Tomato pizzia that was to die for!  Their dinner salads are huge and served in a cold plate/ bowl.  Tonight I had the Seafood Rissotto and I can honestly say I have not met its equal in any Italian restaurant.  Absolutely amazing!  Our server [and everyone] was friendly and courteous.  If you blink, your drinks are refilled. The place was very busy and everyone seemed pleased with their food. The portions will allow you to save some for lunch the next day, which was tough tonight because it was so good.........We'll be back again.........and again.  You need to try this place if you're in town.

With two BBQ joints across the street from each other [the other being Rudy's] my curiosity got the best of me.  HUGE mistake!  I should have turned around and left when I saw the ribs were wrapped in plastic sitting in heating trays, along with the other menu items.  But hey, don't judge a book by its cover, right?  WRONG!  The collard greens were overcooked, and so vinegary that they were inedible.  The Mac and Cheese.....well, KRAFT does a better job.  It was watery and bland.  The Tri-Tip was way overcooked, dry and the best thing about it was the fat.  The jalapeno corn muffin was dry, brittle, and did not taste good at all.  The Baby-Back Ribs were edible, barely.  95% of this meal went into the garbage.  As I left there at 1:00pm I noticed there were only 4 other customers seated in the restaurant.  When I drove past Rudy's I could not help notice there was a line out the door.  If the meal was free I would not eat there again.

Absolutely amazing BBQ!  Since discovering Rudy's we have forsaken all other wannabe BBQ joints!  Even the kids love it.  The Brisket 'moist' is the best anywhere!  THe nice thng is they don't need to smother their meat in sauce like other places.  They have a great sauce, but the bbq stands on its own.  The sides are awesome as well..........and the best part is you can eat with your hands!  They provide rolls of butcher paper and we love to toss the food on the table and go to town!  My 8tr. old daughter loves the brisket as well and her favorite quote is:  You gotta have the fat 'cause if you cut the fat, you fill the flavor!

Unbelievable!  When you drive by this little, and I mean little, place on Broadway, if you blink you will miss it.  But turn around and prepare to enjoy some of the best Thai Food you will ever have!  The Panang Red Curry with Shrimp was so fabulous, it made my eyeballs sweat!  The Vegetable Egg Rolls were equally amazing,  The dining room is incredibly small due to the size of the building, but every table was full of happy guests.  There was a line waiting to sit, and another line out the door for pick up orders.  If you're in the area, stop by and enjoy.

First off I have the write that the crew and staff of this truck were amazing!  Friendly, professional, and engaging.  Unfortunately, that is where it ended.  With all the hype, my expectations were pretty high, however I am sad to write that this was the worst grilled cheese sandwich I have ever tasted.  And the price was criminal!  $9 for a grilled cheese with bacon on white bread?  Really?  I have seen better sandwiches at my kids school cafeteria.  Honestly, I could have taken the $9, bought a loaf of good bread, a pound of bacon, real butter, and a block of cheddar and created a half a dozen sandwiches that tasted better!  I'm sorry guys, maybe you had an off day, but this was a horrible culinary failure.  So disappointed.

We had such high expectations for this new addition to Chandler, however we were disappointed from the start.  The service was slow, the menu is very limited and seems to cater to 'soft' foods more suited to the Sr. crowd which were abundant during our visit.  They have a pretty cool offer of a free pie if your bill exceeds $30, however the pie was tossed after eating only half as it tasted more 'store-bought' than 'freshly' baked.  It's not a place to take children either as the kids menu is all but non-existent.  We will not be back for seconds

WOW!   Pretty much one of the best breakfast places I have encountered in recent years.  Clean, cheerful atmosphere.  Great music.  Outstanding Service.  But most of all........the single best order of Bacon, yes, Bacon, I have ever had in a restaurant -- bar none.  Most pre-cook it, and toss it on the grill for a few seconds.  Others, and this is outright sacrilege, deep fry it..........But this is a place we will return to again and again.
