200k miles!  That says it all.  We've been using ToyoMotors from day one after moving to the valley in 2009.  During the height of the economic meltdown, we knew we had to find someone who would treat us fairly and make sure our two vehicles were dependable and would last.  120k miles later on one vehicle and 80k miles on our other, we know we made the right decision.  I feel like the staff and ownership have worked hard to earn and keep my trust and it's been reassuring to know this part of our lives has not been a point of stress the past 6-7 years.  It's also been great to know I've been working with the same people since moving here.  They remember me each time I call and treat me like I'm their best customer each time.

It amazes me how in today's consumer driven economy a company as big as Cox can get away with such sub-standard customer support.  There is clearly an issue with communication and lack of coordination behind the scenes with this company.  One representative will say one thing just to be followed up with a completely different story from another.  There is a reason why it is difficult to find a positive review for this company.  There is a reason why the average rating for this company is below a three star level. It's obvious the customer happiness index standard is not important in their business model. My advice for anyone considering spending money with this company, please read these reviews and google items associated with their customer unhappiness and the quality of their contour television product! It will save you hours of frustration and a LOT of money...

Ally totally rocked tonight! This place is Def worth the stop.  Miranda is the best. I'm not a fan of cilantro, so I order the hot sauce.  Love it!  The ground beef tacos rock!  Never have had a bad meal here.

The reviews on how quick and friendly the service is are on the mark. Price was lower than others had listed on their websites and location was perfect to either grab a quick bite to eat or browse the stores in the same complex.  This is the place to go for sure!

This is absolutely the best place for breakfast in town.  I've never had a bad meal and only wish they had another location further north.  Their hash browns are some of the best and I love how they use fresh ingredients.  I would try a week day for your first experience so you don't have to wait as long for seating.
