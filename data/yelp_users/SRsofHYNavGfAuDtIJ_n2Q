When my Saab started acting up on the way home from Vegas, I started thinking, thank god I didn't lose to much in Vegas, because this is going to be expensive. So I prepared to pay through the nose thinking I was going to have to drop it off at the dealership, but I did a quick search on Yelp and found these guys. My car and my wallet are better for it.  To say these guys are honest and helpful is an understatement. The problem my car had was a tricky one and tough to diagnose, these guys worked on it way more than what they charge me in labor. They had a sense of ownership that drove them to find the issue and didn't try to sell me any BS flushes or additives. They definately went above and beyond. You don't find that too often in a repair shop, which is what sets these guys apart from the rest.   If you own a Saab or Volvo, this is where you should take your car for routine maintenance and repair, hands down.

I fly in and out of here all the time and even though terminal 2 is a dump, if you're flying on Alaska airlines, it is quick and dirty to get in, out and home...

This place is a belly buster...  Go hungry because the sandwiches are huge. I got the roast beef and it was fantastic, way better than that processed crap that you get at the grocery store, they roast it themselves. My friend got the pastrami and it looked awesome, I wanted to trade.  Also, the sweet potato frys are great, if you've never had them, give them  a try, you'll love them...

Went for the Great Arizona Picnic on Saturday and was not that impressed. When I go to something like this I expect to try something new and exciting. What did I get here? The same Spinato's pizza and Salty Senorita food I can get out in town, not to mention mega chains like Buffalo Wild Wings, The Melting Pot and Chipotle. Meh... The Abolut tent was nothing special either, I mean, you can get that stuff in any bar. Why stand around with a bunch of D-bags in a tiny fenced in area fighting to get a drink?  Let me sum up the event... 1. Wait in line to get in... 2. Wait in line to get a 21 year old wrist band... 3. Wait in line to get tickets... 4. Wait in line to get food... 5. Wait in line to get into the Beer/Absolut/Patron areas... 6. Wait in line for a drink... 7. Wait in line for the Port O Potty... Repeat steps 3-7...  The only bright spot was the beer garden, got to try a lot of unique beers that I have never seen in any stores in Phoenix, so that was kinda cool.

I felt like I had just been given the secret handshake when we went to this place... There's no sign other than "The Truth Lies Within" We walked around for a good bit before we found it...  This place is in an alley behind Cowboy Ciaos. It's very dark inside and cozy. The wine was excellent, they have the largest wine list I have ever seen. My one complaint would be how they organize the list, it's by price, sort of... So if you want a specific type of wine, from a specific region, good luck...  We had the antipasto platter and it was great. Olives, cheeses, cured meats, various pickled veggies (caper berries!!). No food that's going to really make a full meal, so you might want to eat before coming here.

Went there on a Saturday night,  the line outside made me want to leave, but it moved quickly. This place is pretty cool, but I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone. There was an 80's band playing downstairs that was pretty good, but no one seemed to be dancing, weird. The upstairs had a small dance club and the DJ was pretty good. The outside area was relatively quiet and a good place to talk.

Great sandwiches at reasonable prices. The bread is good, the au jus was flavorful and not too salty, and the sausages are made daily.  It was nice to find a place to get great sandwiches. The line moves a little slow, but it's definitely worth the wait. I had the italian beef and my friend had the sausage, both were great.

This is a horrible venue.  Let's start with the ticket prices. Bought them at the window and still paid 3 bucks each in fees!! WTF is that about?  Then it gets better, wait in line, being yelled at "I said take everything out of your pockets and take off your shoes!" by some power tripping 19 year old. I imagine this is how they treat you when you go to tent city too, but wait I paid for this!  The bar was "Meh" ... long waits and expensive beers (5 bucks for a domestic bottle). The bar inside the concert hall was much quicker since it was cash only.  The acoustics were not very good in my opinion. The concert hall reminds me of a movie theater with all the seats removed and concrete floor, so the sound kinda bounces around.   If I were a band, I would skip this place and play somewhere better...

This place was a sausage fest. There was probably 20 guys for every 1 girl there last time I went. The waitresses were hot, but some of them were kind of old to be wearing the plaid skirt schoolgirl outfits. I probably won't go back, I'd much rather go to bar where I can actually talk to a girl instead of stand around with a bunch of dudes.

Went here for the Coldplay concert and was very impressed!!  This is one of the nicest arenas I have seen. The food vendors were top notch and name brand as opposed to the generic food you get in most venues.   Beer was expensive, but hey, it's expensive in every arena...  The sounds were good, the staff was polite and courteous. When we tried to go down the stairs on the wrong side of the section, she took us right to our seats, kinda nice.  The one beef I have is that it is in BFE.   I can't wait until I'm down here next time and have time to catch a hockey game there...

This place is the island of mis-fit strippers...  Went there on a friday night and this place was a disaster. As soon as I walked in with my friends I was ambushed by two big gals. They took me in the back and wanted 800 bucks for them to lick whipped cream off each other... No thanks!  There were only a handful of girls there and really only two attractive ones. They didn't serve booze and only a few of the girls dropped their knickers... What gives??  If I could find the taxi driver that dropped me off here, I'd kick him square in the stones. Not only did he take us to this place, but told us we'd get in for free. We paid 20 bucks and got a "free" water... Whahoo...  If your cabbie recommends this place, open the door, jump out, tuck and roll out... Head to Rick's or the Rhino, you'll have a much better time. we did after we left this place...

We went for drinks and had a little something to eat. The wine list was good. We got there for a late happy hour, so selected glasses of wine were 5 bucks. All the wines we tried were excellent. Some of us made the mistake of getting a mojito martini... Mojitos are good, martinis are good, mojito martinis... not so much...  We sat outside, one of the owners was at the table next to us and lit the outdoor heater so we wouldn't be cold. He was very nice, talked a little about how he had lived in Portland before, he didn't seem to miss it...  We were too late to get any real food, so we got the lobster corn dogs. I thought these were a little misleading, it was more like a seafood thing, not a lobster thing, not bad, I was expecting lobster meat...

I ended up having dinner here on a recent trip and loved it. We had a big group and tried damn near everything on the menu.   We started with drinks, martinis' to be exact, and they instantly won me over when they said they would stuff my olives with blue cheese. We also had a few bottles of wine, our favorite was the Soter Pinot Noir, that stuff was amazing!   The appetizers were all good too... The two that really stuck out were the Caprese salad with fresh mozzarella and the warm Maine lobster salad, I could have made that my meal!   The entrees were fantastic too, just one miss in the bunch and that was the Pad Thai, too sweet and not hot enough, but hey, it's not a Thai joint, so the expectations shouldn't be that high. The things that were must haves were the Short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes, good god they were the best I have had in some time, I will get this if I ever make it back. The bacon wrapped pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly, the rack of lamb was tasty, but a little undercooked for my liking and the scallops were big and came with the "forbidden" rice, which was like an asian risotto, very tasty.   The lavender creme brulee was fantastic at first, but if I had to eat a whole one, it would have been over powering...  The service was excellent, we were a big group, a little rowdy and the wait staff handled us well. From the drink requests to the wine recommendations, we were taken very good care of and I hope I'm able to go back soon...

Chino Bandido, you robbed me of a good lunch!  This place came highly recommended by some of my peers before I moved down here. The concept is very cool, but I think the execution just isn't there. The idea of combining Mexican and Chinese foods intrigued me, but when my food arrived, it came in a aluminum to go container, looking like food I hadn't finished from the night before that I reheated. It was also unceremoniously  dropped off in front of us, they seemed it bit unorganized.   As for the taste, I give it a big Meh. Not bad, not good. The fried rice wasn't very good, but the gringo chicken was tasty. The carnitas was a bit too shredded, it lacked texture and was similar to ground pork. I might think about giving it another shot,  but my coworkers have deemed this place "Off the list..."

Went there the other day and found the cheesesteak to be so-so. The bread was way too dense and the quality of meat and cheese was good, but there was just not enough of it. They also have Utz potato chips and Tasty Kakes, so if you're a transplanted east coaster, you can get your fix. Also, there is no indoor seating, so it's not really good for lunch on hot days.

The pizza was great, the sauce and crust were fantastic. I got the antipasto salad, thing was massive, loaded with cheese, salami, pepperoni, cheese and olives. It was a meal in itself, I ended up taking half of it home.  Sat at the bar and the service was great.

Need a place to eat on a guys trip to Vegas? This place has it all and isn't going to break the bank like some other places in Vegas.  We got a reservation for eight on a saturday night with little trouble on our own, no thanks to our incompetent Concierge at the Mirage.  We started out with drinks and a bottle of wine. A variety of bread and rolls were on the table when we sat down, everything from dinner rolls to rye to brown bread.   Our waiter was the man. He steered us away from the 2nd Mortgage appetizer and basically told us the only two things we needed were the stone crab claws and the king crab legs. We were not disappointed. The mustard sauce that came with the claws was fantastic. The claws and legs were all pre-cracked/opened for easy consumption...  For dinner, most of us had steak. I had the bone in tenderloin (they didn't have a porterhouse, but this is essentially half of one). It was a prime steak and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The lamb and pork chops looked excellent as well.   We didn't save room for dessert, but the key lime pie looked very good...

This place is very impressive. The wine list is great and they have a lot to chose from on the retail side too.   The first thing they give you when you get there is a bowl of popcorn, popped in bacon fat and drizzled in truffle oil and sprinkled with parmesan. Very tasty...  We got a bunch of small plates and shared, the mac and cheese 3 ways was excellent and so was the pig in a blanket.  We each got a different flight of reds, the guy behind the bar was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful in selecting wines we may like. The owner was also there and was talking about a master sommelier that was coming soon, sounded pretty cool.   They have nights with half price food and nights with half price glasses, I just can't remember what they were...  I'll definitely be back at some point!!!!

We waited in line to get in after the Coldplay concert, but the line moved quickly. Once inside we did a lap around the bar, packed. On our way out, we asked the hostess "How long's the wait?" Hostess "None"  We were immediately seated and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food was standard bar fare. Burgers and the like, I had the sliders and they were good.  The beer list was big. I'm from Portland and we love our beer up there and it was nice to see that many unique and hard to find beers on one list.   My only fear with a beer list that great is how long they keep beer on tap. Meaning, I order some fancy pants euro brew, has that keg been tapped for a week or 6 months?

This time of year, when it's a little chilly out, or you're thinking you might be coming down with a cold, I got the cure...  Get a giant bowl of Pho!   If you're not sure what it is, or you're a little freaked out by new foods, don't be. To over simplify it, basically it's some of the best beef noodle soup you will ever have! The shrimp and pork spring rolls are really good as well.   This place is also quick for lunch and the service is always good.

I love a place that has excellent food, impeccable service and is in no way snooty. In Scottsdale I normally have my guard up at upscale restaurants, but this place totally put me at ease.   I made reservations, which I would highly recommend since the dining area is surprisingly small. The decor is nice, a little on the dark side, but they have this cool wall around the kitchen of back-lit glass that provides just enough light.   The cocktail list looked good, but opted for the red sangria, which was pretty good.   For appetizers, we had the crispy cola pork belly. If you get nothing else, get this! The texture and flavors were amazing. We also had the duck empanada which was flaky and good, but the pork belly won hands down in the appetizer round.   The Chorizo Porchetta was really flavorful and the meat was so tender you could eat it with a spoon. The white bean puree was our favorite side. We also got the creamy grits, there was just something off about these I couldn't put my finger on. The were slightly sour and only a little spicy. I kept eating them thinking they would get better, nope.   The other thing we had were the scallops. The sauce was excellent and the scallops were cooked perfectly. The serrano ham on the scallops was a bit too crispy, and crumbled like bacon when I tried to cut it, I was trying to get a bit in every bite.  For dessert, the churros and milkshake finished things off well. Not too much, just right.

I love this place for it's simplicity. They have burgers, fries and dogs, that is it. Too many fast food places expand their menus into a quagmire of mediocrity. Not these guys, for a chain, they do what they know and they don't screw with it.   Now, don't expect In-N-Out when you walk in, you have quite a few options as far as what you can get on the burger, and you don't need to know any of that secret menu stuff. So go nuts, but avoid the jalapenos, you'll not taste the burger, just the peppers.   If you want my advice, the burger is great, and it's not healthy, so don't screw around and just get the bacon cheeseburger, "All the way". And unless you're training to take over for the "Man vs. Food" guy, stick to the regular fries, the large is huge!

Wow, this place was a disappointment.   A group of us ended up here around 10pm on a Friday night. We were seated pretty quickly. The menu looked good, but was very limited for a tapas place.   We ordered a couple bottles of wine and started to order food and the first 2 things we asked for on the menu, they were out of. Really? I mean if you only have a handful of things on the menu, you might want to make sure you don't run out of anything.   We finally decided on some plates to share and to say that they were small is an insult to all things small. It would be one thing if it was small and the best thing I had ever eaten, but most of it was mediocre at best. The other thing, there was almost no bread served with dishes. It's tough to sit around, talk and enjoy yourself when the portions are are only a couple of bites. God forbid you actually come here for dinner instead of a snack, you'll drop a hundred bucks a person to get full.   If you want a good Spanish inspired meal, skip this place and walk a couple blocks over to The Mission, you'll be glad you did.

So I'm not from Chicago, but this place makes me wish I was, except for the fact I hate the Bears and Cubs.   The Italian beef sandwiches are good, but the Italian beef and sausage combo is the sandwich that is taking years off my life. The thing is huge and so damn good. Get it with the hot peppers/giardiniera. I almost never have room, but the fries here are the crinkle cut type that remind you of the ones your mom used to make, except these ones are good, fried to perfection. The Chicago dogs are great too, they have the right buns, relish, sport peppers and of course the Vienna Beef dogs.   The one thing I wish these guys had was beer. Nothing washes down an artery clogging meal like a nice cold beer. I mean, you're not going there to get healthy, so why not? I'm sure as hell not going to wash that sandwich down with a diet coke, that's just not an option.

What can I say about this place other than amazing! A friend's birthday was coming up and wanted to get something unique in the way of a cake. We ended up getting a cake shaped like 3 balls of yarn with edible knitting needles sticking out of it. How cool is that! I posted a photo, it was impressive looking and tasted as good as it looked.   Their customer service was good, they took payment over the phone and they were also able to make it within a week despite being busy. I would highly recommend these folks for any of you cake needs, you know you have needs... lol

The crab cakes are the best outside of Maryland!!!  They are all crab, real blue crab, not that stuff spelled with a "k". And there's no filler either. They also have great crab soup and crab dip. The sliders were excellent as well.  Every time I visit the Phoenix area, this is one of my stops. It might not be the fanciest of places, but you will get some of the best food and some of the coldest beer I have found in AZ. The people working there are some of the nicest around.     Also, I love that the woman behind the bar calls me "Hun"... Makes me miss the east coast....  Oh yeah, if you like whole blue crab, you can get on their email list, they let you know when they get them in fresh!!!
