First off we knew we were in for a wait seeing it was  a Friday night but 2 hours is a little excess. The one waitress was throwing up in the bathroom Without washing her hands. To top it off our service at the table Was horrible.  Took 25 minutes to get an ice tea Refill. Also overheard the waitstaff talking poorly about our table From the kitchen. Food Wasn't even that great --- former Buca di Beppo employee ( 10 Yrs ago)

Came here this past weekend with my sisters bachelorette and the customer service was amazing. All of the staff was super accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we were having a great time. Not only was the staff amazing, but the food as well.

The customer service was amazing. This hotel is the best in Scottsdale. Very Retro with updated rooms, great pool and restaurants. I stayed here with my sisters bachelorette party and it was truly a weekend to be remembered.

-10 stars. They sit there and let their racist karaoke leader mock customers and get into altercations and shove women who are patrons of the bar. He has assaulted our our family by physically shoving  the hat of my brother deeper onto his head instigating a fight between a big group of people. This bar only supports their " regulars" and do not make new customers feel welcomed.

Joelle is the best massage therapist I'd ever had. Joelle is very professional and extremely attentive. I feel very lucky to have come across Joelle and will continue to go back time after time for her services. :)

I go here every once in a while but always leave feeling disappointed. I rarely see an esthetician who knows what they are doing. For my most recent service I went to Leslie for a brow lip and chin wax. She had applied the wax so low it was on my eyelids. I was terrified for her to rip it off. Needless to say my eyelids were swollen for the whole day. She left hair on my lip and chin area. But it was cheap and convenient and you get what you pay for.

My first feeling upon my arrival at Darque Tan was AWKWARD. The receptionist was taking a smoke break with some friends and considering smoke smell is not the most pleasant thing to be greeted with, it made me feel uncomfortable to approach the salon and walk in. And so I did, not only to have to wait while she had to clean every single bed because she was too busy prior to have that maintained.  This happened the second time I went back as well. Let's just say the minute my package expires I'll be looking for a great tanning salon. Any recommendations?

I love this place. I brought my puppy here for her first haircut and she was well taken care of. You get  a great vibe when you walk into the store and all the staff has been very welcoming and friendly.  Its pricey, but I believe in you get what you pay for.
