Enjoy the quality of espresso drinks :-) they have pour overs also; so far for the times I've come in, they bring my drink to me personally.  Excellent customer service!  They have a hardware-type decoration & furnishings.  Not my taste, but it's their identity, not mine.

Came in at a non-traffic time.   Ordered the lunch Pad Ga Pow with sliced beef.  I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted it, but the spice level was just right / on the hotter side for me.  For dessert, the fried banana w/ ice cream was awesome; it had a pleasant contrast of texture of the ice cream and banana.

First couple of drinks and visits were great.  Quality of drinks seemed to decline over time (e.g., grinds in drip coffee). Panini sandwiches are good though.

I scheduled a same-day late afternoon pick-up with Tommy for my girlfriend's old car to be towed 28 miles from Peoria to North Scottsdale for a trade-in.  Arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule and was real friendly and professional at the same time.  When I informed him of a mix-up of receipt at the Scottsdale car dealership, Tommy provided great details of whom he spoke with at the dealership and the specific location where the car was dropped off.  After the issue was resolved, I didn't call Tommy back; but what makes this 5-stars is that Tommy called me back to ensure the towed car was taken care of at the dealership.  EXCELLENT customer service.  Price (specifically, cost per mile) was better than two other companies I searched.
