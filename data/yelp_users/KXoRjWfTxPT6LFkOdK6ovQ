I'm not sure what everybody raves about. The place, in itself, is very cool. You park around back and they have little artist's huts and the inside it cozy and would be a great place to maybe hangout and have a few drinks. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and maybe I ordered something on their best that wasn't their "best" dish, but unfortunately I won't be going back to find out.   I took it to go, which may have been my first problem. I paid just under $9 for the wrap (asked for without onions) and opted this time for chips. When I got back to the office and opened it up the wrap was in paper and you could see mainly pits and not much stuff inside, but I figure maybe all the good stuff is piled right out of site. After ripping off almost a 1/3 of the pita, I finally get to the good stuff....and my first bite. Ick! onions!!! I had asked for no onions and now my first bite I was chomping on them. Put the pita down, scraped out the onions that weren't hidden, and tried again. The tahini sauce poured of of the back on the wrapped paper and as it hit my plate I then noticed how oily it was....the sauce actually separated in front of my eyes. Ick #2!!   When all is said and done, yes, I'm full. The chicken was ok, a little dry, but edible. Was it good? Yea ok, it was good....was it $9 good? Definitely not. And sadly to say I won't be returning for lunch to try anything else on their menu that may have peaked my interest before.

Now I can't comment on their service, as I took takeout...but this place is DELICIOUS! I'm always looking for healthy places to eat for lunch and sometimes it's a strike-out. You know those places....the ones that promote good, healthy eating and when you check their nutritional values you just gobbled down 800 calories and 64g of fat! I had their Greek Chicken Pita and it was FABULOUS! SO good, so fresh, so tasty....and you know what else? Totally healthy! The entire pita is only 300 calories, so if you're watching like I do, this is great. There's plenty on their menu to keep you coming back too. And while you're there, try the slaw, different, but quite good! I'll be back for sure!

Holy delicousness! I was SO in the mood for a good sandwich....which we all know is few and far between. Everything about this place screamed great sandwich shop. But the best part...the toasted sesame roll. I don't care what kind of sandwich you order off their menu, just get it on that roll. I am so excited for my next sandwich craving so I can go back!

I wanted something different for lunch, so I checked out the menu here and everything looked delicious. I ordered their Crazy Gyro Salad (which has no lettuce)....but man, it was super tasty. Nothing over the top incredible, just darn good food. I gave them an extra star because they were super helpful and extremely nice. Oh, and try their Sangria....very refreshing on a hot afternoon!

We absolutely love this place! When we get out for date night, this is where we go. The waitstaff are great and the food is delicious. I always have a hard time deciding what to get because we love it all....from the fried okra to the jambalaya...If you're in the area this place is definitely worth checking out.

I have ordered all of our Special Occasion cakes from the Sugarlips Team! Wedding cakes, anniversary cakes, birthday cakes, everything. THe last one they did was my son's 1st birthday. We had a monkey theme and I gave them a copy of the invitation we sent and they designed the cake and smasher that PERFECTLY matched! Everybody here is super helpful and have some incredible ideas. So whether you know exactly what you want or need ideas on how to put it all together, this is the place to go. Their prices are completely reasonable and their cakes are beyond delicious. Every raves when we get a sugarlips cake that it is the best cake they've tasted. And their cupcakes are just as good!

My husband and son bought me $40 in gift certificates for Pan Asia. Its is right by our house and we always enjoyed going there for dinner. Unfortunately, we tried going there for dinner last night to use the gift certificates they just bought last month and the place is closed!! There's lien signs on the doors and windows! So angry that we JUST bought gift certificates and took our money and they're shut down so I can't even use them!

This place was mediocre at best. I went with my sister for lunch. The rolls were completely overpriced ($11 and $13), which wouldn't have bothered me so much if they were good. Bland doesn't even describe them. We got the Sakura and Geisha roll and for all the delicious goodness that was supposed to be in them, I was extremely disappointed at how crappy they were. I was totally in the mood for sushi too, which makes it suck even more! They were a nice size, which is why I gave this place the 2 stars. At least I wasn't starving, I was just lacking good sushi when I walked out. And the service there is almost as bland as the food is. And I agree with someone who said it in another review...those seats are HORRIBLE!! Maybe it's a better nighttime spot? Who knows, I won't be going back.

I have to say. This is, by far, my new favorite spot!! Everything about this place was AWESOME! Let's start with the place in general. It over looks the canal by the trolley bridge in Scottsdale, which is so pretty at night. We walked up and thought, here we go, a typical "stuffy" Scottsdale restaurant, but not even close. One of the waiters walked right up to us, greeted us and let us pick our own table on the patio....which it was the perfect night for! We then are told how it's happy hour (everyday of the week 5-7pm) where all wines are 2-for-1 and all tapas are buy one, get the same for free! SCORE! He was very helpful since we weren't sure we wanted a full heavy meal, so the waiter recommended around 4-6 tapas plates and he would just bring them out 2 at a time. He also recommended a phenomenal wine. We had the meatballs, braised oxtail, aoli papas, croquetas, and lamb chops. Everything was amazing. My husband went in thinking he'd hate this kind of place since he wasn't eating "a real meal" but even he was thrilled with the entire experience!! Plus, they have flamenco dancers inside, which just adds to it all! They just opened 2 1/2 months ago, so I hope they keep up the great food and great service, because we'll be sure to get back! Very soon....

I have to say that it is so refreshing to find a company that does a stellar job supported with fantastic customer service. We called a few different companies for quotes, suggestions and ultimately went with JGM because they just nailed it! We were looking to have a dog door installed mainly for our new boxer puppy. We wanted it in an odd spot, under some open counters in our kitchen and then wanted to gate across there and have it like a makeshift kennel - close the gate and allow her access outside and in without have free reign of the entire house.  They came out the first time with a few different color optiosn to look at, explained everything, answered all my questions and made recommendations. We called later that day and had decided that JGM was the way to go. They came back out a few days later and this has to be the cleanest most professional installation I've ever had...of ANYTHING. He draped the floor, bagged all the installation without getting it all over. Plus he saved the drywall they cut out and the stucco in case we ever need to remove the door and patch it back up. Amazing job! They installed the dog door in around an hour plus they lined it with carpet so it doesn't get hot in the summer on her paws. Plus he even took the time to show us how to train our dogs to use it!   Even after that we were still trying to figure out a way to create that custom kennel area. We didn't want a cheap plastic baby gate, and it was an awkward size. After a few days they even called us with some links to gates that would work for the area. They weren't going to make any money off of it, and still did research to help us get the end result we needed.   Seriously, if you are  thinking about a dog door, don't even waste your time looking around. JGM has a superior product backed by impeccable service! 5 stars isn't enough for these guys.

I really really wanted this to be awesome. I work next door and have been teased by the "Coming Soon" sign for what feels like an eternity! Well, the day had finally come, March 5, the GRAND OPENING of my new breakfast and lunch hot spot.   Grand opening I was so happy they were finally open. My coworkers and I walked on over for some breakfast. I ordered a Four Cheese souffle and a medium Americano. They were pretty quick, happy to see you, greeted with a smile. Score! I'm happy now. Got our food and walked back over to our office. Coffee was great, I'm eating my souffle....there's a hunk of something in it that I bite down on. Upon further inspection of said souffle, there are artichokes in it. Ok, no biggie, I just didn't realize there were artichokes in the four cheese one....and upon inspecting the site, there's not. They had incorrectly given me the Spinach and Artichoke one. Not an awful mistake, except it's 70 calories more and I ordered the Four Cheese because it was lower in calories.  Lunch, let's just head on over and we can regain our excitement of Panera being next door. I decide on the Power Mediterranean Roasted Turkey Salad. Looks super tasty, super healthy and again I am happy! We get our lunch and head on back over to our office. I open up my lunch...what a cute box. A little disappointed because from outside the little boxed window it doesn't look very big. Not very big at all for a $9 salad. Oh well, I open it up and stop in my tracks. There's some turkey, cool; olives, check; no lemon juice, but 2 olive oils; and spinach, like less than 20 leaves. I move aside the spinach looking for more and I just get the bottom of the cardboard box....where's the rest of it. There's no "salad" in my salad. Now I'm totally bummed. I call over, more-so to let them know the kitchen might have a hiccup and the Manager tells me they want to make it right, to come on over and they'll fix it. At this point, there's a line out of the door and we just agree to take care of it the next day.   Panera isn't all it's cracked up to be so far. BUT....they have promised to make it right!! And now here we are. Walked on over this morning, spoke with the Manager who once again apologized. No biggie, bumps in the road, it happens. I order up a coffee and the Power Breakfast Egg Bowl with Steak. The girl at the register isn't sure how to ring it in, the manager helps her...I hold my breath.....ok, we're all set. She comped my breakfast and coffee, the order got put in, we're golden right? Grab my bag, we walk on back. Sit down at my desk, mmmm steak and eggs and avacado and.....at this point is where you hear the screeching halt of tires. I get that things in real life don't look like stuff in the professional photographs, but they didn't even try. For some reason my breakfast was on salad (maybe that's making up for the lack of it from the lunch) the "Two all-natural eggs, freshly cracked every morning" were actually just two ice cold egg white patties. Gross. And their "seared steak", well that was a cold chewy mess as well. I couldn't even stomach it. Take a look at the picture:  http://i62.tinypic.com/2hcnsk2.jpg  After all that, they've struck out 3 times and lost me as a customer.
