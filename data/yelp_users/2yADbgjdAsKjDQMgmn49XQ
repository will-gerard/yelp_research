I was very disappointed my last experience at Sauce. I ordered a spinach and apple salad with chicken. I think the apples were from a few days ago wtih no taste and the shredded chicken must have been in the freezer and put on the salad. The kids however did enjoy their mac and cheese. The salad was terrible!

Thank you for making our party the talk of the town! Shantal we appreciate your personal touch on the party. We had the chicken, steak and mushroom tacos as well as the ceviche spoons. The food was terrific!  Great communication with Shantal and staff. They did a great job and no mess was left to clean up:)

Blow out was good. I was very surprised that I was charged another $10 for my hair to be curled with a curling iron...this was in additional to the $35 for a blowout. Are you kidding me? I have been going to this location on several occassions and this is the first time I was charged the additional $10. Don't think I will be going back....Dry Bar here I come...it is all inclusive of curling iron and blow dry.

I really enjoyed the new NORTH in Arcadia. The waitress Madison was very helpful and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was lively and fun! The only thing I had a problem with is that when you asked for bread, they said there was a charge for this.  I didn't think that should be the case....otherwise I would give it an A-.

Very helpful...quick and honest. I thought my iPhone was cracked...so I brought it in to get fixed. Good thing I had glass protector on the phone. So they replaced the glass protector instead...the phone wasn't  cracked. I personally wouldn't have know the difference.  Instead of paying $90...I paid $35.
