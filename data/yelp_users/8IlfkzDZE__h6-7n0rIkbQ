I was introduced to hillstone (houston's) years ago by a friend of mine when I worked in midtown Manhattan. By far, the BEST French dip I've ever had. Hands down. Fast forward to living in Phoenix and meeting hubby and he now is hooked. We've since relocated to San Diego but are coming to AZ this weekend and I'm planning how we can fit in a visit to Hillstone on Sunday before we leave!!  The spinach dip is also awesome. Tons of spinach and love the sour cream and salsa on the side. With the French dip, I like that you can get it done to your specifications--in my case, still mooing! The fries are excellent too. I've literally never had a bad meal here and service is always great. very consistent with food and service across the board.   Please, please please come to SD!!! Driving up to Santa Monica to get my French dip fix is no Bueno!!

My husband and I enjoyed an excellent meal here last Saturday night. Definitely not a cheap evening, with drinks and dessert, over $200, but well worth the splurge. Not sure about the past complaints about service. Our service was spot-on, courteous but not intrusive. We enjoyed an amazing view of Phx with the last window seat...score!  Food was excellent, and I wish I could remember the name of the wine we had! I started with a Brussels salad (note to self: you still don't like Brussels, no matter how much they "dress" them up!) salad was not bad, mind you, just not my cup of tea! Hubby had a butter lettuce salad with lardons and sharp Oregon cheddar...super yummy!  Being the carnivores we are, we both completely enjoyed our filet mignon, served with baby carrots and fingerling potatoes. Heavenly! My meat was the perfect rare (still mooing...ha!). The serving sizes were perfect.   We rounded out the meal with two desserts, creme brûlée for me and some sort of chocolate flourless thing for my husband. Both were good, because dessert is never bad! But, not the highlight of the meal. Best creme brûlée goes to Donovan's, amazing! All in all, a memorable evening and a great place to celebrate a special occasion!

Well, the extra star is really for the fact that I love our front-loader washer and dryer and that they were on sale. Didn't go to our regular Lowe's (Ray Rd) as they didn't have the models in stock. Absolutely disgusted and appalled at their customer service or lack thereof when it came to the delivery and installation. We were told they would call us Saturday morning to confirm our delivery slot. To err on the side of caution, we even called to confirm Friday night. Three phone calls later on Saturday morning, we come to find out that our order isn't even ON THE TRUCK! Seriously?! To add insult to injury, the "manager"  (I use this term loosely),had the audacity to ask if he could deliver it tomorrow! Absolutely unreal. So it's now noon, we still don't have our new appliances nor any idea of when they will be delivered. What an absolute joke and waste of a perfectly good Saturday. Thanks Lowe's, just how I wanted to spend my weekend, waiting for you jokers to get your crap together. Thumbs down!!!! Do not recommend the Chandler Road to anyone! We have always been very loyal to Lowe's and this seriously makes me think about switching our alliances to home depot!

Love: Dr Hummus--best pita and tzatziki we have had since Greece this past summer. They sell his stuff at AJ's, but much fresher at the market!  Crow Dairy: mmm regular and bacon chevre. awesome on spinach salads! Love the pics of all of their farm animals!  Pork on a fork: pulled pork. Need I say more?! Amazing. The bone-in chops are wonderful too.   There's also a stand that sells cobblers that are to die for and another one that sells flavored butters. And the crepe truck. Heaven...

Keep coming back to this booth at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market for more porky goodness! LOVE the $12 bag of pulled pork, had it with their new BBQ sauce, yummy and easily two meals. Have had both the bone-in and boneless chops, equally good. Think I'm leaning towards the boneless only due to my preparation...I butterflied and stuffed them with French bread, sweet onions, garlic, gorgonzola and prosciutto..drool! Check them out, you won't be disappointed! My hubby and I go after our standing Sunday appt with our trainer. Love it because they give you samples, and I'm usually starving by then!!!

So, so, so happy that we finally have a decent restaurant in the foothills! Native is good for what it's worth, loco is kind of "eh", so this really is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!   Love that they have the local beers on tap (hello yummy orange blossom!) and also that they embrace the farm to table concept. It's really inspired our own cooking at home and shopping the local farmers markets.   Adore the artichoke dip, burger is delish as is the pork tenderloin. Have yet to have a bad meal here! Looking forward to this sticking around and maybe moving into Sunday brunch (LOVE brunch!) good luck guys, we are pulling for you!!!

Amazing. I love this place and recommend it to others all the time. I learned about it when I first became pregnant last fall due to a flyer from my OB. One prenatal massage from Brittney and I was hooked. I went twice a month during pregnancy and I think it helped immensely. Brittney is the sweetest ever, but more importantly, she's consistent and is a great therapist. I look forward to our appointments together even though I've scaled back to once a month. I've had many massages and this place is the best! Go! You won't be disappointed!
