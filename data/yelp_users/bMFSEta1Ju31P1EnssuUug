Went there for lunch today 3/2/13.  Business hours posted said they closed at 4PM on Saturday's.  Then why the hell were they close at 350PM ?  I will never visit this establisment again.

This is a great place to enjoy some food and or drinks before or after an event at the arena.  The prices are very reasonable and soft drinks come in a huge glass.  Therefore,  you may not even need a refill!  It's always been quiet when I have been there but the only drawback is they close I believe like 10 or 11pm.

The Hot Dogs are delicious and prices are reasonable.    I love their daily lunch special 2 Hot Dogs, Fries & Drink for $5 !

Taco Bell has really improved over the years as they are simply the cheapest fast food option.  Most locations are serving up bigger portions such as their bean burritos.  Few years ago you buy a burrito and would get very little beans and taste mostly tortilla.  However, today you buy a burrito and you can enjoy your beans and sauce from the first bite to the last for just 99 cents.  I love their tostadas and even those are loaded now !

T-mobile lost a loyal customer of 5+ years.  They refused to work with me while I was struggling during the recession.  I told them this is how you treat a loyal customer ?  They said ( My situation ) was based on policy.  I told them to cancel my account and four lines and they would never see their EFT fees at least in my life time.  No wonder T-Mobile is struggling they don't know how to keep loyal customers happy and CUSTOMERS.  T-Mobile, Meh.  I've experienced better.

My family and I always go to this Big Lots on our way to Roadrunner Park.  We like to stop by and get bread for the duckies and snacks and drinks for us while we enjoy the park next door.  Great customer service.  Great location.

They have great pairs of shoes at discounted prices.    They also have different apparel for cheap as well although its not consistent.    However, if you are ever in the area you might experience the WOW FACTOR like I did when I scored two shirts for $20.  If you love NIKE and need a fix then Nike Factory Store is as good as it gets !

We haven't been to an Applebees in like ten years. We received a $30 gift card for Christmas so a course we went. Customer service is really great here with all the employees being cheerful, having smiles on their faces and being friendly.   My wife ordered a medium well steak with mash potatoes but it came rare. It took nearly 30 minutes to get her new steak and when it arrived they gave her steamed vegetables instead of mash potatoes but they quickly brought them out when mentioned.   Applebees gets four stars because of their great customer service and specials plus the manager and server apologized countless times about the steak. They comped my wife's dinner and offered us dessert for free. It was a great gesture and definitely left us with a great impression.  We will be back at some point as the food is decent and the prices reasonable especially during happy hour and other promotional days. Its definitely a great place to unwind, enjoy some comfort food and drinks.

My son (7 yrs old) and I decided to try this place today and it wasn't too bad it was actually pretty good.   The location is at a strip mall and upon entering you will notice the establishment windows are dirty and have smudges on them indicating it probably has been awhile since they have been cleaned.  We were welcomed by the cashier who was very friendly and cheerful and constantly smiling. It was genuine but I am sure it's because she was holding her beautiful little 13 month old daughter too. She was so precious!  We ordered the beef and broccoli for $8.75 which included two big scoops of fried rice, one egg roll and one golden shrimp. Prices are cheaper during lunch 11AM -3PM we were there at 330PM.  We waited about 10-12 minutes for our food as it was freshly prepared and served nice and hot. The beef and broccoli were on point as well as the rice and egg roll. We ordered an appetizer of 8 golden shrimp they were huge but had too much breading on them we love shrimp but will skip the appetizer next time.  My dogs enjoyed them though hahaha  There are no fountain drinks but only two liter sodas for $3 a piece and they were room temperature with no ice available. We declined and had room temperature water and then went to Circle K for a polar pop after our meal.  I also thought it was cool that they had a huge poster with pictures of their entrees so that you could see what your meal looks like before your order. Its helpful if you want try something different next time.  Speaking of which there will definitely be a next time for us. We will visit during lunch for the cheaper prices and delicious food since our favorite go to place Chen Wok at 35th Ave & Thunderbird closed :-(   Chung Ming has delicious fried rice and next time I will order it with the shrimp mmmm

Initially, I wasn't happy about  arriving 10 minutes early for my appointment only to wait an additional 30 minutes ( 40 minutes total ) to be finally be seen.    However, once called back, the medical assistant was nice and I asked her ( since I was a new patient ) if this ( long wait time ) was the norm.  She stated no that it was just really busy today.  Fair enough.  The doctor came in and was real nice and answered all my questions and was patient.  He wasn't rushed like most of today's doctors are.  We came up with a game plan for my health related issues and off I went.  Real pleasant experience.  Consultants In Internal Medicine PC, I'm a fan !

This has been our animal hospital of choice since we moved back to Phoenix in 2006.  They have wonderful staff and Dr. Striyle is the best !  However, over the years their prices for services and visits have steadily climbed so much so that I don't take my animals there anymore.  We can't afford their high prices.    Blood Work, X-Rays, Dental Cleanings etc are very expensive but I know that this is where they make their money.  Services beyond the initial visit fee.  We go to VCA Animal hospital now.

My baby was ten years old and had a tumor growing inside her left leg. The initial treatment was great as all the staff showed compassion and treated my baby with care.  As the tumor continued to progress it became apparent to me that it was all about the money at that point. Rather than tell me the inevitable Dr. Schmidt kept wanting me to do blood work, X-Rays and other bullshit tests when in reality my dog was at or near her life span.  Amputation was an option but a course it was a expensive and no guarantee the cancer hadn't spread elsewhere.  During this time rather than try to up sell me they should have just told me to prepare for quality of life and enjoy the final months with my baby.  I felt swindled and no compassion from Dr. Schmidt.  They have now lost our business and we have three cats and two dogs.  We now go to Arrow Animal Hospital who are open seven days a week until 7-8PM and offer payment plans for any services totalling $200 or more. This offers great peace of mind and allows you to get your babies treated right away. It takes away the financial stress. You simply pay a $10 payment plan fee and a 20-25% deposit and have 3-6 months to pay it off.  They are located on the NW corner of 51st Ave & Thunderbird in Glendale.   My little homie has a growth on his tail causing him extreme pain and was bleeding all over. Amputation of his tail was the only option but I didn't have $1,000 for the amputation and other related services but I did the payment plan was able to get him treated right away!  Arrow Animal is definitely our vet of choice moving on.

Dr. Vadikuti is best !  She is very knowledgeable, nice and truly cares about her patients.  She is a real advocate for her patients.  She doesn't rush through her appointments.  The office staff are nice and friendly as well.  If you ever find a need for an Endocrinologist this is the place you want to be.

BTMC is too busy and gets pretty swamped which I think explains why your experience here may be touch and go.   The employees here are just too stressed out at times.    My family has gone to BTMC over the years as it is centrally located for the NW valley and even parts of the west valley.   The pediatric ER was fantastic as one mentioned earlier.    The psychiatric ER is great as well.  My last experience there ( March 2011 ) was pleasant considering I was very intoxicated but not belligerent but I have diabetes so acourse my sugar level was off the hook so I told my wife if I ever get crazy intoxicated ( doesn't happen often ) make sure you take me to the ER.  Nonetheless, they took good care of me.  The most recent experience ( Feb 2012 ) my blood pressure and blood sugar was extremely high and just would not go down ( no I wasn't drinking LOL ) so I called my doctor and he said go to the ER.  The receptionist had an attitude and was really irritating me.  They did an EKG and back to waiting room.  Chest X Ray and back to waiting room.  The ER did not appear to be busy so I was like WTF is taking so long to get a room ?  Finally, after the receptionist frustrated me enough I decided to check myself out because obviously, at least it seemed anyway, my blood pressure and sugar level being extremely high was not much concern I said screw it I will just go home.  Luckily, there were no further consequences from the high blood pressure / sugar.  So again, not a horrible hospital just expect touch and go service.

I been eating here off and on over the last 15 years but I wouldn't call myself a regular.  They have great burgers, fries and shakes.  They are a great value.  They also have a humongous breakfast sandwich.  I feel guilty eating her sometimes hahaha.  I probably eat Carl's Jr 1-3 times a year.  Carl's Jr is A-OK!  P.S. Try their Bacon Gucamole Western Angus Burger the burger itself is $6 but the meal is oly $8.75 after taxes.

I can always count on Kinko's FedEx for all my business needs !  When the computer printer at home is acting up and I need an important document printed Kinko's is always there.  Internet access is only like 20 cents a minute and to print one page is like 35 cents.  Have to make copies?  10 cents a copy and the machines are quick!  Need to FedEx something?  You have until 515PM.  Great location and very nice employees.

I have never been too big of fan of Walmart.  However, lets face it.  They are open 24 hours 7 days a week and when you need something such as pet food, cat litter, boxers just to name a few after you get off work at 10PM then its nice knowing SOMEPLACE  is open that offers reasonable prices.  The associates at this store are friendly and are helpful.  Everytime I am there shopping I have always been asked if I needed help finding something and or they simply say hello which is rare anymore anywhere you go these days.  It's funny because its an sincere hello not an automatic its your job to say hello like at QT.  Its sincere not robotic.  Customer service is better here at this store than most Walmarts.  Walmarts are touch and go.  You have your good ones and your bad ones.  This location is as good as it gets for a Walmart.  So, Yay !  I'm a fan.

We moved to Surprise ( New Home ) in 2003 and started doing business with Bill Johnson State Farm in 2005.  I practically know everyone in the office.  They are nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  Bill Johnson and his staff have taken great care of us and been there for us when we needed them.  We eventually moved out of Surprise and back into Phoenix ( ASU West Area).  I bring this up because we could have switched to another agent way closer to home.  However, that never crossed our mind.    State Farm has our business and protects us with Auto, Life, and Home Policies and even services ( State Farm Bank ) our car note.  Like A Good Neighbor State Farm Is There !

I have been going to this auto spa off and on since 2006.  They have reasonable prices and do a fairly good job.  They are open as early as 7AM and as late as 6PM.  This is my auto spa choice when I need an oil change and want my truck washed and looking great afterwards with the interior and tire dressing.  My red truck looks sexy afterwards.  It turns me on.  LOL.  For the VIP wash and oil change I believe I pay only $33 and that's only If I add a beverage while waiting for my baby to be done.  I also barter with them when I need my coolant / transmissions fluids flushed.  Customer service isn't the best.  Oil change is quick with no problems.  The workers washing and cleaning your vehicle are hard working.

I had to visit the ER due to being heavily intoxicated and with diabetes that a course is dangerous. All the nurses and doctors treated me nice and professional and were very patient with me as apparently I was a chatter box my entire time in the ER. I don't drink all the time and in fact the last time I had to go to ER for intoxication was about four years ago but this was at Banner Thunderbird. My experience at St. Joseph's was 10x's better.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because I asked for a wheelchair to be wheeled out at discharge. I asked 2-3 times and each time they said no. I finally said fine if you guys want the liability if I fall that's on you.  I know dealing with intoxicated people can be difficult but they still need to be treated like a human being and with dignity especially when they are diabetic.  I did not feel safe leaving but I was able to walk out and get to where I needed to be with-out falling.  No I did not drink and drive ;-)  I will address my concern further when they send out their survey.  Otherwise, it has been 25 years since I was treated at St. Joseph's and other than my discharge complaint I would definitely recommend St. Joseph's Hospital and Dignity Health for your medical needs.

Presto Auto Title Loans are a joke !  They advertise one thing on TV yet when you go through the process everything is not as advertised.  If you want a quick and legit title loan do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

Speedy Cash is as good as it gets !  The location on 51st Ave & Olive in Glendale is clean, the staff super friendly and the loan process a breeze.  They offer registration loans and title loans with an array of other services.  Most registration loans are $500 if you choose and super easy to pay back.  Just remember do not borrow more than you can borrow and pay back.    Payments are generally about $45 every pay day for a $500 loan but most of it goes to interest so make sure you pay back your loan as quickly as possible to avoid paying almost double the amount you borrowed.

Waffle House at this location is as good as it gets !  Great food.  Fun staff.  Weird clientele.  However, we are all there for one thing and that is to eat great food at a great price.    My favorite meal is the two pork chops and eggs which includes hasbrowns and  toast all for about $7.  Its a cool place to hang out as well.  Their dessert pies are super cheap too.    $1.50 are you kidding me ?

For some reason, this Target store did not impress me.  They had a very poor selection of clothing in all areas. I would recommend the Target at 43rd Ave & Peoria.  We were only here because we had a $50 gift card otherwise I never go to Target as their prices are slightly higher anyway.

My Galant's brakes were squealing and being as we bought our baby brand new in 2007 and we now are in 2012 I knew it was going to be time for new brakes !  All the other places that I called said well we can't do it today but you can bring it in tomorrow.   Uh, no !  I am the type of person that when my mind is set on something I want it to get it done NOW when I am thinking about it not the next day because I will forget and then it won't get done.  Well since Pep Boys is only two miles from my house and it was approximately 3PM plus the fact they don't close until about 8 or 9 in the evening I knew my chances were good that I could the job done today.  Off I went to the store.  Explained my situation.  Brakes were checked.  Estimate was given.  Price for job completion was in my budget.  Two to three hours later my baby had new brakes and the rotors were resurfaced !

This store is a little weird like one reviewer mentioned.  It is frequented a lot by the students who attend the nearby Moon Valley High School.   However, once they start loitering around too much and in large numbers the owner of the store will tell them to take a hike.  They have check cashing services.  Money orders ( When its working ).  This is basically a ghetto Circle K with-out the Circle K sign ( Used to be a Circle K though ).  I like this store because I can cash my checks there especially when the recession kicked my butt and I lost my checking account.    The check cashing fees are slightly lower than the competition but thankfully I am back on my feet with a checking account.  A&S Cactus Express I'm a fan and you should be too if you live in the area and a need a check cashed !

We have been patronizing this restaurant since the late 90's.  You can't find a better deal in town $2.99 for breakfast ?  Are you kidding me ?  $2.99 gets you two eggs, hash browns or home fries and your choice of bacon or sausage.  Add one additional item if you choose for .99 cents.  They have buy one get one free coupons as well.  Check them out !

I have never had bad service at Staples and they always have what I need when I need it.  They have great prices and great selections.  I was in and out of the store the other day in less than two minutes.  Woohoo ! Staples is my new office store !

Every since our favorite Mexican Restaurant ( La Rosa's ) closed many years ago we have been patronizing Garcia's ( 35th Ave & Peoria ) whenever we are in the mood for decent mexican food at a reasonable place, price and at a sit down restaurant.  The prices are very affordable.  You can literally buy the three item combo with rice and beans for $11.99 and feed two people and with the unlimited chips, bean dip and salsa your stomach will be begging you to stop eating.  Well since I am fat I like to buy the two item combo ( $10.99 ) with rice and beans.  The soda's are always fresh.  The margaritas look very delicious but I am not sure of taste or quality or even the price because I usually just pop in for lunch but one of these days I will give it a try.  I was at Garcia's last Saturday and they had a special of two cheese enchilada's with rice and beans for $6.99.  Are you kidding me ?  That's an amazing price.  Service is always prompt.  They are happy to see you and serve you.  In closing, I am not saying its the best mexican food in Phoenix but Garcia's offers the best service and price in town at least at this location.

Timbertree Apartments are decent if you are just looking for a decent affordable place to live.    These apartments offer you close proximity to Chase Bank, Metro Center and all the area restaurants in the area.  You have a shopping center right next door that includes the 99 cents only store, Petco, Staples, In&Out Burger and much more.  Rent is cheap.  Staff are friendly.  New management took over less than a year ago.  Grounds are generally clean.  They ( MGT ) work with you if you are late or gonna be late on your rent.  Residents seem nice enough and stay to themselves.  My brother has lived there probably for three years now !

I love this CVS and this is my go to store when I want to earn and redeem my extra care bucks. The surrounding area is always busy so I don't understand why they are not open 24 hours as the Walgreens one mile south on Dunlap is open 24 hours and that area is ghetto!  Anyways, the store always have things in stock especially the special advertised items. CVS has a great rewards program and if you do it right you can save lots of money!  The employees are for the most part helpful and the store is fairly clean. We get our prescriptions filled at the CVS at 83rd Ave & Thunderbird we only live 5 miles east and they are open 24/7.  CVS does not have all the extra stuff that Walgreens sells but my shopping and pharmacy experience is far superior at CVS.

I have been patronizing this location for over ten years and during that time their prices have really gone up as well.   However, they do have some good specials sometimes and if you ever land a coupon that really helps as well.  The quality of the food has gone down a little.  I am not sure if they are using different cooking oil or what but Church's Chicken is not what it used to be back in the day.  But when I want me some greasy chicken and french fries this is the place.  Prices for an individual meal are perfect.  Once you start buying for a family be careful because it adds up quick !  The customer service here is not too bad.  They are hard working.  However, depending on who the manager on duty is at the time dictates the quality of service.  Very small location.  Very busy at times.  Church's Chicken ( This Location ) I'm a fan !

Alot of things from the yester years.  It was a cool experience and prices were very reasonable.  I didn't buy nothing on this day but I will my next visit.

This is my barber shop of choice.  Haircuts are $12 for all ages.   No discounts unless you are a senior citizen and I believe that is on Wednesday's.  They are open Mon-Saturday 8-5 and they tend to be the busiest earliest in the morning and late afternoon.  If you go between I'd say 10AM to 2PM you should have no wait when both barbers are there.  There is only two.  The only thing that sucks is that they are closed on Sundays and from time to time one of the barbers will be gone for a week or two at a time for vacation.  This is when the wait times can become unbearable but again stick to the above time and you should be fine.  There can be a language barrier but once you become a regular that will change.  They do a very detailed job and take their time.  There can be people waiting but it doesn't matter.  You're in the chair !  They also do awesome hot towel shaves for only $12 and again its very detailed and they take their time.  Look, there are cheaper places to get an haircut but Boris Barber Shop is as good as it gets !

The burger combos are expensive compared to an ordinary fast food place but the burgers and fries are so yummy. I visit here about once a year and that's just because it's too expensive to make it a regular spot but when I want a good burger and fries this is the spot.  They only get four stars because they got rid of Pepsi products and brought in Coke.  However, through Yelp when I check in I receive a $1 off any burger combo!  Scored that deal today and OMG the burger and fries were amazing!

This place when using their coupon is an amazing value.  I have been there twice and the food was plentiful and oh so fresh. Beware food can be real greasy at times but who is thinking about nutrition at a buffet ?    Anyway, the food is never old nor stale but always fresh because they keep just enough food out between rotations.    Lunch is $7.99 with self serve beverage but with coupon it's only $5.99 !  Dinner is $9.99 but with coupon it's only $7.99.  Great Wall Buffet is an excellent value !

This is a very busy QT with everything you expect to get at QT which is clean restrooms, friendly staff and plenty of anything you need.  My only complaint and its just due to the neighborhood is that some customers don't know how to act in public.  This idiot ( female customer ) actually blocked two handicap parking spaces just because she was waiting for somebody.  This is not QT's problem just lack of home training for some people in the area.

Souper Salad is legit !  Especially, when you score their coupons.  As a matter of fact, I am about to redeem mine this week.    $4.44 for an all you can eat salad, soup and other delicious items that they have ?    Oh yeah, suck on that Sweet Tomatoes !  To score their coupons all you have to do is sign up for their emails from their website.  They send out coupons consistently but this one $4.44 is by far the best one since I signed up.  Look, this location anyway, might not be the best looking but once inside you have unlimited salads, soups, pasta salad ( small selection ) bake potatoes, ice cream, pizza etc.  Regular price I believe is $6.99 and an beverage is $1.99 save your money and just drink water !  Sweet Tomatoes is expensive I believe $8.99 plus the price of your drink and they are no different than Souper Sald.  They seem like they have a larger buffett but they don't because both sides of the buffets have the same offerings.  Its designed to move you along quicker because they certainly are not offering you more.  Souper Salad is as good as it gets !  They are at least $2 cheaper and when you multiply that by a family of four ?  That's an $8 savings !

Palm Glen Animal Hospital is legit.  I remember my mom used to go to their old location at 35th Ave & Glendale many years ago when I was a child for our pet needs.  Well the time came again when I needed Palm Glen.  We had a house fire and we needed a safe place for our two cats and one dog.  Palm Glen has very reasonable boarding rates !!!  $16 per night for a cat.  $25 per night.

Whenver we need new furniture and or bedroom set we always go to the Roomstore !  When we lived in Surprise 2003 ( New Home ) we went to the 59th & Bell location in Glendale and bought us new furniture for the living room.  No hassles ! Easy Financing ! Stress Free Home Delivery !  Next, we bought us a nice bedroom set which came with the queen size bed, headboard, dresser, end tables and lamps all for a great price.    No hassles ! Easy Financing ! Stress Free Home Delivery !  When we moved out of Surprise in 2006 and back into Phoenix ( ASU West Area ) I told my wife that since I just got my big screen TV she can now have her nice big dining room table since the house we moved into has a much larger dining room.  No hassles ! Easy Financing ! Stree Free Home Delivery !  Later on, the queen size bed became too small for our to use due to kids and pets LOL so we put that queen size set in the guest bedroom and went to 35th Ave & Northern location and bought us a king size bed and  everything that goes with it.  AGAIN, No hassles ! Easy Financing ! Stree Free Home Delivery !  The Roomstore has great furniture.  Decent prices. Quick home delivery and for the most part they let you shop and browse with-out being hassled by the salesperson.  The Roomstore is ideal for bulk furniture and or large purchases its not ideal for a la carte such as just buying a couch.

Office max has officially lost my business.  They advertised "WE HAVE YOUR INK" well when I go in to get my ink guess what ?  They don't have my ink.    They don't carry Dell ink !   Office Max brand ink that would have been comparable and usable guess what ?  They don't carry my series number ( 21 ) only up to 11.  I went to Staples and not only did they have a great selection of Dell ink but they had my ink !   I was in and out of the store in less than two minutes !

Sizzlers is as good as it gets !  We have been going to Sizzlers for many of years because their food tastes excellent and the value is out of this world.  Prices have gone up about a $1-2 so that will humble you real quick if you haven't visited for awhile.  However, they have a great lunch special that includes your drink and salad bar for a low price of about $9.99 I believe.  They also have express lunch pricing as well.  At dinner your salad is still included but you have to pay $2.50 for a drink and for a family of four that is $10 extra dollars !  Uh, no thanks !  H2O for the fam bam please !

Sizzler is still a great value!  We choose to get the 6oz steak, side, drink, salad buffet and dessert bar for just $13.99 plus they give you complimentary rolls!  Total cost for two people after taxes is $30.30. You can also choose from malibu chicken, cheeseburger or six jumbo size shrimp at this price with above mentioned side, drink, salad buffet and dessert bar.  Sizzler the best value in town when you hungry!

Poor customer service tonight at the location in Phoenix-Metro Center. I asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp. The waiter said I couldn't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited.   I replied and said well that is nice to know but it would be nice to have consistency because it has not been a problem the last few months.  We generally enjoy Sizzlers on a monthly basis and the waiter rather than let it goes wants to argue about policy, how other employees weren't doing their jobs and could be reprimanded for letting me take home the almighty shrimp.  The whole time the lazy manager observes this and does nothing. He doesn't intervene but rather let's a waiter argue with a customer.  We have been frequenting this Sizzlers since 1998 and now just because you would rather throw away 10 pieces of shrimp rather than let the customer enjoy them at home with the expectation that next time we wouldn't be able to take the shrimp home you instead lose a loyal a  customer.  Texas Roadhouse, Black Angus and Longhorn's just up the street I am sure will appreciate our frequent visits.  To the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp!

I went to this store yesterday to purchase swimming attire and sun blocker.  This store was decently busy and it was real nice to see especially with KMART closing stores left and right.  As of late, I have been taking advantage of their lay-away program.  So far this year I bought me a 32 inch TV, summer clothes for my son, Amazon Kindle Fire and digital camera.  I love lay-away !  Their shopper rewards program which I initially thought was whack I come to find out I have over $17 on my card that I can use anytime I want.  Yeah, I am a fan of Kmart !

This QT located at 39th and Greenway is my favorite.  The staff are fast, friendly and the restrooms are always clean.  This QT is not nearly as busy as the others which makes it a more pleasant experience.    My only gripe is that they charge .79 cents for a fountain drink ( 32oz ) when I can get a 44oz in a styrofoam cup at Circle K for the same price.  This QT is my QT of choice !

Second run movies ( after they have been out for awhile ) are only $3 everyday except for Tuesday's which are $1.50.  Free refills on large popcorn and large fountain drinks. I have a family of four and we get the large popcorn and fountain drink combo for $11.25 and it suites us fine and on Tuesday the same combo is only like $10.50.  The theater itself could be kept a little bit cleaner especially in the common areas.  However, I attribute that to poor managment and for the reduce price to see a movie I tend to over look it.    $23.25 buys a movie for a family of four with popcorn and soda with one free refill  now that's a deal !

Great wings. Delicious potato skins. $2.75 large drafts Sun-Wed from 10PM to close.  The best part about Santisi is the food and drafts.  They have friendly and cute servers and one sexy one.  Nonetheless, getting your first order can take awhile their customer service can be real slow at times.  The only negative is that their kitchen closes at 11PM except for Thursday - Saturday which is midnight.  Great food. Nice drafts. Friendly, cute and sometimes sexy female servers ?  Yay, I am a fan!

I love this location !  My favorite is the macho burrito ( Huge ) and the french fries all for about $5 give or take plus tax.  Del Taco is right next door to the ghetto Circkle K so you can't miss it.  They have great specials from time to time such as .39 cent tacos.  If you live near one give them a try.

I have been going to this Blimpies off and on for over 15 years.  They truly have the freshest bread and ingredients.    However, I am a simple man.  I will take me an ham and cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise on white bread and I am a happy camper.  A simple sub shop with simple ingredients for a simple man.  Look, if you want all the different varieties that Subway offers then Blimpies is not for you.  However, if you want a simple old school sandwich like the ham and cheese or even the roast beef with spicy mustard then you can not go wrong here.  You can even score a $5 foot long on select sandwiches and you can even make your sandwich a combo meal just like at the other places.  You remember the commerical ?  Simply Blimpie For Fresh Slice Subs !

La Fama Mexican Bakery a South Glendale tradition !  They make fresh homemade tortillas every morning at 4AM and they are ready for sale at 6AM.  Whenever the wife and I are craving bean and cheese burritos we always go to La Fama's to get our tortillas.  They have mexican cookies and breads as well.  Don't be scared and make the drive to La Fama Mexican Bakery the earlier the better for the tortillas because they will be hotter and fresh upon arrival.

Dazzo's is not located in the ghetto !  Its located at 63rd Ave & Glendale right across the street from Glendale High School you know the school that has been there for nearly a 100 years ?  Dazzo's alone has been there nearly if not more than 30 years so folks that should give you an idea of the area where this place is located.  Its an older part of Glendale and nothing less and its completely safe.  Nonetheless, this place has the best food in town when it comes to hot dogs, hamburgers and anything else you crave Chicago style.  My favorite meal is the polish sausage with cheese, ketchup and onion served with fries for less than four bucks !    Over the years I have tried their hot dogs, chili dogs, burritos, hamburgers except for the Italian Sausage / Beef but I will eventually do so one day.  The Italian Ice is the best and the soda's are always fresh.  You get one refill of your soda for like 50 cents.  Only cash is accepted.  Its a very small successful family restaurant so you can see why they would only accept cash.  They clearly post outside before you enter that they only accept cash as well.  If your in the area for business, work, family, friends or driving through the part of Glendale for a ballgame Dazzo's is a must.  They are open Mon-Sat 1030AM to 8PM and closed on Sunday.

Took in my first hockey game at the arena with Coyotes taking on my team the Saint Louis Blues on 3/2/10.  My wife and I had great seats 5th row from the glass so the action was acourse awesome.   Prior to this game, the last time I was at this arena was in 2004 so it took me awhile to figure out where everything was such as concessions because this arena had lots to choose from than just your ordinary hot dog and popcorn.  The arena for a hockey game is absolutely the best and I agree that any seat in the house would be a good seat to see the action.    However, I like to be up and close besides I will only be attending a game or two a year so I can easily afford to splurge on the higher priced seats once or twice a year.  The prices were reasonable for an arena but expect smaller quantities.  For instance, they want $6 for a soda but it was only like a 24 oz maybe so settle for the $4.50 bottle soda.  The beer prices appeared to be about a buck cheaper than over at U.S. Airways Center.  Do not eat anything from the Hooter's concession stand.  I bought a small cup of french fries ( $4 ) and two orders of 10 wings ( $8.75 ea ) because we love wings and we heard good things about Hooter's wings.  We get down to our seats and the fries and wings are cold !  We just wasted $21.50.  We will never eat at this arena again.   Parking is free so don't pay $10 for the premium parking unless you just want to throw money away like we did for our food.  Get out and walk as Westgate is nice to stroll through on the way to the arena.  Overall great place to catch a live NHL game and on Thursday's they have all you can eat hotdogs, nacho's and popcorn I believe including soda for $30 per person.

Circus Circus is a great value even with the stupid resort fee. At least here they give you a coupon book worth $150 in savings at the casino, shops, midway and adventure dome. Some coupons such as two free midway games, $5 off an aqua massage, free drink coupons and match play just to name a few. We stay in the West Tower room because its closer to check in and valet and they are remodeled.  Check in can be nightmarish because they always understaff but remember they are open 24 hours and the bell desk is in the same area. If you don't want to wait check your bags in, go have fun and check in your room later.  Our rooms have always been clean although you do get some idiots smoking in non smoking rooms which is just plain ignorance but not the hotels fault.  Overall, Circus Circus is legit and all the reviews posted are pretty much on point but we don't care this is our hotel of choice when visiting Las Vegas!

Slots Of Fun managed by Circus Circus just needs to rollover and die. This is not the Slots Of Fun of yesteryear. They took out all the live table games and dealers. There was not many slots like there used to be and they added pool tables. Who the hell goes to Vegas to play pool? I did not see a bartender nor a waitress but that's probably because I was in and out literally in under 60 seconds. I might check it out next time only because it seemed quiet and I hear they have $1 video blackjack based on prior reviews.

Corleone's have great Philly Cheese Steaks but they will run you about $6.50 and if you add fries and a drink that will run you another $2.50 and it with tax you are talking about $10 for one person to have lunch.  They do have a great lunch special at this location two slices of Philadelphia pizza and a drink for $4.99.  I have yet to try that but from what I seen the slices are huge and are good ( per a co-worker of mine ).

Bobby Q has great BBQ at an reasonable price and above average portions.  You will not leave hungry.    Don't let the exterior of the building fool you.  It looks ghetto and run down but I think that is the look that they want.  Once inside, it looks better and again the BBQ is delicious !  Friendly servers.  Complimentary donuts.  Yes, I'm a fan !

University Of Phoenix Stadium ( Stupid Name ) is as good as it gets !  This stadium is huge and real nice inside.  I was inside for the first time for Wrestlemania back in 2010.  Very impressed !  I still have not caught an Cardinals football game at this stadium yet but I am sure the game experience is awesome !  The exterior of the stadium looks lame and generic but once inside its as good as it gets !

When I want a fresh and juicy burger WHATABURGER is the place I go to !  I love the Bacon & Cheese Whataburger.    Combo meal is only $6.88 after taxes and that includes your fries and drink.  This restaurant is always clean.  Employees friendly and nice and the best part ?    Both the drive thru and dining room is open 24 hours !  Whataburger is old school I remember ordering their food at America West Arena ( Now U.S. Airways Center ) when I went to Suns games back in the early 90's.

I respect the men and women of law enforcement so despite my following review let that be known.  Phoenix Police is always hit and miss as far as customer service.  You have some officers that don't want to do anything ( Lazy ).  They will literally respond to your call just to say there is nothing they can do especially when it comes to mental health citizens.  They literally would rather be REACTIVE rather than PROACTIVE.  Look if you receive a call about an individual who is disturbed and someone calls in wishing that that individual be checked on.  DO IT !  You can get back to your local QT and hang out for a real call later.  Phoenix Police officers are some of the most unprofessional looking I have seen in law enforcement.  Officers with tatoos all up and down their arms ?  Reputable security officer companies don't even let their officers show up to the work place like that.  Oh well, God Bless the men and women of law enforcement and thank you as always to Phoenix PD for at least responding when I need them.

Peoria Sports Complex is a great facility for spring training baseball.  We went to this ball park on Friday, March 4th to see the Reds and Mariners.    The best seats in the house are in any section behind the home plate area.  We scored two great seats in Section 206 Row 2 just to the right of home plate for only $38.    The concession stands have your standard ball park fare.  However, there are a few independent concession stands where you can buy food items such as indian fry bread, fried noodles and other goodies.  You can even by an all you can drink cup ( 32oz ) for $9 and enjoy unlimited soda refills the entire game.  Peoria Sports Complex does spring training right. Its what spring training is all about and if you haven't watched a game here then you truly haven't watched spring training baseball.    Parking was only $5.  I even got to shake Dusty Bakers ( Reds Manager ) hand after the game.

My family and I have been going to Thunderbird Internal Medicine since 2007.  This practice is always fast and efficient.  You never have to wait too long to see your doctor the majority of the time.    If you have an appointment you can rest assure that you are going to be seen on-time.  Our favorite, Dr. Edgecomb, left the practice in May but they have plenty of other great doctors that you can see.  www.thunderbirdim.com is their website give them a try !  Thunderbird Internal Medicine is as good as it gets !

Dining Room closed at 10PM on a Friday ?  Are you kidding me ?  My four year old son and I ended up having to eat our meal in my truck because the dining room was closed.  Anyways, the food is always fresh.  Reasonably priced.  Employees are competent and happy.  I have had no bad experience here.

I don't know why Fry's Food & Drug bothers to stay open past 10PM as they are so limited on what they can do for you after that time.  We went in to buy some laundry detergent and get a roll of quarters ( Have to wash clothes at hotel ) and acourse they didn't have any.  I guess its not that big of deal but its just frustrating especially since Winco has entered the market and is far superior even against Wal-Mart.  Fry's is lucky they are basically on every corner because once Winco builds out across the valley Fry's will be hurting.

My family and I love Black Angus and had a large dinner spending approximately $100 on our meal.    We decided to enjoy the chocolate brownie with ice cream that my wife and I could share.  We had the two can eat for $39 ( Something Like That ) meal.  Anyways, the big brownie comes out with a TINY scoop of ice cream.  I asked the waitress if we could get another scoop and she said that would be $1.50 additional.    I was like are you serious ? Our check is approximately $100.  She said it was the cost of food.  No problem, I didn't ask for a manager because I am not going to argue about ice cream.  However, the waitress tip reflected her attitude and non-willingness to obliged.  She could have at least asked her manager about it.    Let him or her make the decision and don't give a lame excuse "It's the cost of food"  Needless to say, we will not be dining at this Black Angus in the future.

Quail Plumbing is legit and don't play games.  When you call inquiring about service they will give you the estimated costs if you ask at mininum such as labor, trip charge and machine charge if applicable.  They don't play the I DON'T KNOW game that most other valley plumbing compaines do such as Roto Rooter.  This prevents the awkard moment of when the technician comes out and evaluates your plumbing issue and then quotes you an off the wall amount to fix it.  Then you feel stuck because you know nothing about plumbing except that it makes your life easier.  The next time you have a plumbing issue or simply need an installation of sorts call Quail Plumbing !

I miss the old building and staff. I have been frequenting this location since the 80's and even worked there a short time when I was in high school.   Every since they opened up the new building with new staff it simply hasn't been the same. The seating area is smaller, the play area for the kids is a joke compared to the old one and the place just lacks any charm.  When I do decide to visit their ice cream machine is always down and or unavailable. The credit machine is down. I simply just visit other McDonald's when I am in the mood for their food.

I will say that the Carne Asada is very good here but after that I am not a fan of El Taco Tote.  This is not to say that they are a bad restaurant.  I just don't like their food.  I will say that this location is always packed so they must be doing something right but as far as I am concerned.  Meh.  I've experienced better.

My wife likes Great Clips and she normally goes to this location for her cuts but she often complains about the wait times.    However, you are able to schedule appointments now.  I feel $13 is a rip off for an hair cut because I only pay $12 for a barber and they do a much better and detailed job.  But when you catch a coupon from Great Clips you can't beat a haircut for $7-9 but I still prefer my barber.

We have been going here for years. Grooming is cheaper. Staff are nice and animals always come home looking and feeling fresh. I get my small maltese groomed here for about $10 less than other places. The only negative is they are always changing their business hours so always call ahead. Currently, they open at 8AM Wed-Sun and closed Sun-Tues.

Discount Tire is legit !  I love this location because they are friendly, fast and efficient.  Prices are reasonable.    Sometimes they will try to up sell you and or add things automatically to the tab with-out telling you making it seem like its part of the package.  However, they are very patient and will answer any and all questions and will lower the bill if need be to fit your budget and get your business.  Moreover, stop by anytime during business hours and they will check your tires and fill them up with air as needed FOR FREE !  Note to the competition MOVE OVER because Discount is as good as it gets !

My wife, son and I are traveling to Missouri in January 2011 due to a family member not doing too well. Anyways, we did the normal checking for flights etc from Sky Harbor. My sister n law who is also going but on a different day mentioned that she got a flight from Allegiant for super cheap. I'm a cab driver and have driven passengers to Gateway Airport and I remembered them giving good reviews.   Anyway, I go online to check flights and I am immediately shocked at how much the flights were. Mesa to Springfield, Missouri only $47 one way person and $19 way back home per person. Yes, there was $9.99 pre-boarding fee which would have added an additional $60 to trip.  Also, a $14.99 fee for booking online which would have added an additional $$90 to the fare. I did some more research and said ahh hell no, I'm not paying those fees. So I drove an hour to the airport because buying tickets there is free. However, I saved $90 bucks !  The ticket agent noted that since we are traveling with a small child ( 2yrs old ) we would get priority boarding anyway. Just saved $60 more dollars !  Conclusion, I only paid $284 total with taxes, airport and standard security fees for three round trip tickets and no convience fees.  To save on the $35 per checked bag we are going to FedEx our luggage to family.  Only down fall is airport is 60 mins from our house hence the $14.99 convience fee. But the 2 hour trip was worth it ! No other airline can match that $284 for three !

This speedy cash location has saved me many of times financially especially during this recession.  The loan process is easy.  All you need is a vehicle registration, bank statement and debit card.    Once you fill out the short application they will let you know how much you are approved for.  The first time, my wife was approved for $250 and most recently I was approved for $600.  Pay your loan back fast !  Interest accrues daily and most of the mininum payment due on your payday just goes to interest.  If you pay back the loan fast this is not a bad loan !  All the terms and conditions are in black and white.  At this location, the loan agents answer any and all questions that you have.  Ask questions !  Enjoy your cash !

Westgate wasn't too bad as it was actually kinda of cool to come out of the arena after the hockey game on 3/2 into the plaza with the fountains right in the center.  What I like that Phoenix ( Downtown ) lacks is all the places you can hit up to eat and or drink after the game and or concert.  Don't get me wrong there are places to go in Phoenix after a game but its virtually a ghost town after a night game.  However, there is a cool spot to go in the same plaza as Chase Field prior to a ballgame especially an afternoon game.  Back in Glendale once you walk out of the arena you are walking into action and we almost caught a movie but then decided against it but that's what Westgate is all about.  Plenty to do before and after the game.  One major disappointment is that after the game we wanted to eat at Johnny Rockets because the food in the arena was disgusting.  Anyways, we walk into the restaurant and I would say at least 70% of the restaurant dining area was messy with food left on the table from previous diners.  Keep in mind that it was obvious that the restaurant had a major rush but come on that is unacceptable to have a messy dining room that bad and to top it off as messy as it was they certainly should have had more than one person cleaning.  In closing, Westgate is the wannabe Scottsdale.  Westgate don't have shit on Scottsdale but for the WESTSIDE its great and doable.  Next time I will definitely arrive 2-3 hours before game time ( Hockey ) and enjoy dinner and some drinks.

The food was average and there was a funky smell throughout the restaurant like someone had diarrhea the smell was coming from the bathroom. We let the manager know but he didn't appear to care.  This was a typical buffet larger than most but I do not like to wait for my refills so depending how busy it is will determine how long you wait for your refill.  We tried Golden Corral in Boise, ID and Goodyear, AZ both better experience.  Quite frankly, we prefer Old Country Buffet and will continue to patronize them instead of Golden Corral.  Dinner is cheaper and you get your own drinks :-)

All my animals that have been apart of my life have come from being adopted from Arizona Humane Society.    My last mut was only $35 to adopt but he's truly a mut so if I didn't adopt him I don't think anyone would have LOL nonetheless he's my little guy.  I like the AZ Humane Society because I know the animals are well cared for and have been given all the up to date shots that they need.    They are netured and given a wellness exam plus you get get complimentary medicine if needed for the common colds that animals can catch at places like these.  You also get a free basic office visit at participating veternarians.  Sadly, if you have to put one of your animals down like I did about eight months ago you can do it here much cheaper than at a vet who charge astronomical prices to euthanize.  I don't get how death of a loved one and or animal is such big business.

I haven't tried this location yet but I am familiar with the Lenny's on 35th Ave and Thunderbird as I have lived in the area for years.  Their burgers are very delicious as well as their fries.  The only reason I don't frequent Lenny's too often is because I am so used to the fast food and cheaper prices.  However, make no mistake about it the best burger in town is Lenny's so give it a try heck with today's value meal prices at other fast food places your not gonna pay too much more anyway unless you like the dollar menus.

Your time at the Arizona State Fair is what you make of it. People complain that admission is $10 but the ASF has so many promotions that on certain days you can get free and or discounted admission.  So basically if you are paying full price for admission then you are not doing your research on the many promotions that they offer. I have not paid full admission in years.  We love going during the $2 rides and game days and last year we donated six pairs of shoes on that day and got free admission for the wife, myself and son.  DO YOUR RESEARCH FOR ASF PROMOTIONS  We generally go at  the beginning of the day when the fair opens and stay until the sun goes down. The quality of people during the day is better and a course the lines are shorter for food, rides and games.  We are not afraid to be there at night there is just nothing to do that you can't do during the day. The concert line up sucks and I have been going to the fair since the 80's.  We always feel safe and we are white people. LOL.  There is plenty of security and police to give you the "peace of mind" but you can have all the police and security you want but if shit is going to go down its gonna go down just like last years teen brawl.  The food is very expensive but if you take into consideration how much the fair charges the vendors just to have the privilege of being able to set up at the fair you can see why food cost so much.  Based on information from the ASF website for vendors they charge a $2,000 guarantee plus 23% of gross sales or after taxes net whichever is greater.  No one says you have to buy food at the fair in fact your allowed to bring food in including drinks just no glass containers.  Bottom line, the fair is fun and the main reason we go is for my six year old son. A smile on his face is all that matters. Do your research and I guarantee you that you can have a great time at the fair and not having to spend your rent or mortgage payment to do it.

I don't understand all the hoopla about this place.  The last time I ate here was probably 2005.  The burger and fries were average but I wouldn't say spectacular.  The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice but when I want to enjoy a great, fresh and non-microwave hamburger I always hit up Whataburger.  To each there own I guess :-)

My wife, 5 yr old son and I had just arrived from Phoenix to Circus Circus at 7PM and we were starving so obviously we hit the buffet. Upon arrival, I could not believe how much the price was for dinner. It was $16.99 for adults and $11.99 for kids. Total price $49 bucks!  The food was decent but like others mentioned some of the offerings seemed like they were frozen items such as the pizza. The macaroni cheese was definitely boxed but even Kraft mac and cheese looked better than here at the buffet. For the price, there could have been more selections. The salad bar looked unappealing. The desert bar was average. All in all I will never eat at the buffet strictly due to the high cost and average selections.

The prices are really high but the pizza is really good we paid $14 for a 12" pepperoni which consisted of eight slices. We will definitely eat here instead of the buffet and enjoy a tastier meal for a lot cheaper.

If you love Cuban food this is the spot for you !  All the meals begin at approximately $10 but you get more than enough to eat sometimes more than you can eat depending if you arrived really hungry or not.  Service is a little slow.  I don't know what the hell their problem is because like you will be sitting there and it will take up to 10 minutes for them to come and take your order even when they are not busy.  The food arrives about 10-15 minutes after you order it but that is worth the wait because they cook your meal from scratch and it is so delicious.  They serve soda by the can and there are no free refills so expect to pay about a $1.50 per soda.  They have a great selection of beer and they are average priced.  It can be a little loud in there because of the loud music but its their restaurant so what do I care.  I suppose if became a nuisance to me I could ask them to turn in down ?  My favorite meal is the Chicken cooked in Cuban spices and white rice on the side.  They give you a very small salad to complete your dinner on the plate.  Also, with the meal comes a decent size ( picture oversize coffee cup ) of Cuban black beans.  OMG !!!   That right there folks is worth the wait and $10 bucks !!!  They are coming out with some other caribean food as well.  Last time I was there about 2-3 weeks ago there was a puerto rican family enjoying puerto rican food !  My friend enjoyed some Cuban coffee !!!  The family restaurant are Cuban so rest assure you will get a true Cuban dinner.

I love stadium style seating and AMC 30 has it. The theater is never crowded but then again I almost always attend the $5 matinee. Popcorn is average and its really the only thing that I don't like about AMC. AMC Stubs is a great rewards program. Check it out!

I can't stand this Walmart Supercenter.  It's dirty and crowded.  However, it was the closest location to me at the time and they do have what you need and generally its at a low fair price.  It's your typical Walmart but I prefer the one in Glendale on 59th Ave & Bell

This review is for all Valley Circle K's.  The stores are generally filthy, dirty and sometimes disgusting.    However, the employees are much nicer and chattier than years past.  The only reason why I frequent Circle K is because of the 79 cent fountain drinks and their hot dogs.

This place is legit nothing fancy but they have a great happy hour on drinks and food.  Two Chicago style hot dogs and french fries $4.95 on Monday's which is the night we were there.  $5 shots.  $3.50 for a very tall glass maybe ( 30 OZ ??? ) of budweiser and bud lite drafts my choice of beers.   Draft was FRESH  and they had half price wings on this night.  Two pool tables.  Two dart boards.  One of those newer jukeboxes that you see in a lot of bars now.  It appears they have karoake on some nights.  I don't smoke but you can still chill out on the smoking patio because they have this sucking ventilation that sucks the smoke out I guess.  Very chill. All the patrons at least on this night were very laid back and fun to be around.  Staff were cool and quick with the drinks.  Jenna the bartender was sexy.  I live on the Westside but this is a great east valley bar.  We only came across this bar after meeting some guests at the nearby hotel we were staying at for a quick get a way.  Great time !

First, if your a Dodgers fan you will love this park.  I'm a STL fan and love the game of baseball in general especially spring training.  We went to the Friday night game and watched the Dodgers and the Giants.  It was a good game and I enjoyed hanging out with the family in the lawn seats.  There was over 11,000 fans at the game.  The game start time was 705PM and I don't recommend going to a night game here.  Getting to the ballpark is a hassle during this time because you are going to get caught up with rush hour traffic.   The concession stands had long lines at least until the 4th inning.  The prices were typical of a major event.  Food was decent.  I enjoyed chicken tenders and fries for $6.75.    At the end of the game they had a post game fireworks show.  It was awesome and I think it takes place on Friday's if there is a night game.  Overall, I won't be attending this ball park again for spring training.  It doesn't give you the spring training feel.  Its too big. However, It does offer an up close experience to the batting cages, practice fields and the Dodger players around the lake.  In closing, the tickets to the games are too expensive for a spring training game and it doesn't even offer a spring training experience.

Maryvale Ballpark is the best spring training facility to catch a game.  It's cozy, comfortable and has charm.  Tickets are probably the cheapest in all of spring training. If you want to see all the MLB stars up close and personal than Maryvale ballpark is the place for you.  Home plate tickets are $22.  Plenty of concession stands and restrooms probably more than is needed for the size of the ballpark but they definitely have more than most spring training ball parks.  Maryvale Ballpark does spring training right and is the valley's best kept secret when it comes to baseball.

Goodyear Ballpark is a nice place to catch a spring training game.  Our favorite seats are in the Right Field Pavillion.  You can enjoy hamburgers, hot dogs, chips, shredded chicken barbeque, cookies and unlimited non-alcoholic drinks all for $30.  This ballpark is good for like once a year visit for spring training.  Its too far but it is very fan friendly. Plenty of activities for the little ones.  You can still catch all the action while roaming around the ballpark.  Again, nice place to catch a game but nothing special unless acourse you love the Reds and Indians.  My recommendation is make the trek out there buy a lawn seat and then sit anywhere you want.  Never any big crowds.  The night we went there was 4,000 plus.  Earlier in the week they only had a little over 2,000.

24 Hour Fitness is legit !  I love this location because the employees at check-in are always nice and the facility for the most part is kept clean.  Plus, it doesn't smell like urine or sweat !  The locker room area is okay I mean its a locker room.  I like the fact that you can take a shower in privacy instead of the public shower rooms like at Bally's when they were still in business.    I have nothing to be ashamed of but I never understood the concept of showering in front of everybody.  Its quite stupid if you ask me.  The hot tub jacuzzi is always hot and clean.  I love the sauna and steam room.  Daycare ( Kids Gym ) is only $15 per month and is open 8AM to 12PM and then again at 4PM to 9PM.  This is perfect as my four year old son is our little motivator.  He wants to go to the gym !  An daycare employee got an attitude with the wife ( I wish she would have with me ) because my wife finished her work out late and picked up our son 10 minutes late after the Kids Gym closes.  Look lady get over it !  We pay $15 per month.  If you had to leave in such a hurry try using the intercom next time.  Don't give an attitude !   Anyways, this gym is open 24 hours with the exception of Fri and Saturday when they close at 9PM.  The metro center location is open 24 hours 7 days a week.  24 hour Fitness.  Yes, I'm a fan because I love working out when I want even if its 1AM !

My family was displaced by a home fire and so we had to replace some clothes.  We went in on a Tuesday and it was 25% off!  Believe me when I say we bought nearly $300 in clothes and other items and we walked out only paying $135!  The clothes are nice and decent just make sure you allow enough time to shop because you really have to look to find the nicer and quality clothes.

Whenever we want some fresh fruit and vegetables and at a decent price Sprouts Farmers Market is where we go.  Prices can be a little higher but they do have specials from time to time but you can always count on the freshness of the produce.    Vegetables and Fruits are at their yummiest when they are fresh !

The people working at this location leaves a lot to be desired but they were quick and nice.  Generally, I am not a Popeyes fan but for some reason I was craving them and good thing I was because the chicken was delicious and I mean ever better than KFC and Church's.  Church's chicken has gone down hill taste wise.  The chicken on this night was delicious from first bite to the last and acourse the sides green beans, rice and beans and mash potatoes were delicious as well.  We scored a 11 piece meal with two large sides and six biscuits for $19.99 except I added another large side.  I must say I wasn't before but now I am a fan !

Well I was a loyal customer until today 5.9.14. After paying off my pawn tickets $425.00 after they had been renewed several times over the past year I inquired about my layaway that I did back in November of 2013.   The assistant manager Art told me that the lawaway was cancelled back in January. I advised Art that I was given no time limit in which to pay the layaway and get this he said he knows and that's why they had to write staff up because they were telling customers there was no time limit.  I then said well can I at least use the money I already paid ($45.00) and use that towards the lawaway and just pay it off today?  He said NO because there is a 90 day layaway time limit. I advised him there was no time limit given to me. He said he couldn't prove that. I said you just mentioned that you had to write staff up because of them telling customers there was no time limit.  He then starting talking about policy this and that.  Keep in mind, they cancelled my layaway in January of this year and put the two items back on the floor.   We are now in May (5 Months Later) and the two items are now on the floor for sale.   Still!!!!  So instead of making the sale, clearing inventory and keeping a 3 year customer happy and coming back Art wants to hide behind "policy", keep my $45 and lose a customer.  Who promoted Art? My God why are people in authority so afraid to make decisions that promotes your business and keeps your customers happy.  Its not like I got mad and said I want my money back.  I asked to use it towards the purchase and I pay it off today!  I will take my business elsewhere Art and I hope your boss Edwin is very proud of you.

We were with Monotronics for at least five years.  At first, everything was going good until we found out that for six months they were not receiving a signal from our home which means that if we had a true emergency such as burglary or panic button they would not receive the signal.  What tickles my elmo is that FOR SIX MONTHS they were not receiving an signal and not once they did call us yet they are supposed to be monitoring my system 24 hours 7 days a week ?   Whatever !  We cancelled so beware of this company and any other company that promises to protect you and your home 24/7.

I personally prefer Filiberto's but they have been raising their prices so much this past year that I decided to try Federico's which is only two miles from my home !  Federico's at this location is the best.  They have select combo meals for $5 and that includes a free beverage !  Are you kidding me ?  Tacos with your choice of ground beef, shredded beef and chicken for .99 cents ! Everyday !  Bean and cheese burritos are only $1.49 !  My favorite combo meal is the taco, tostada, rice and beans with a free drink for only $5 plus tax.  This meal alone can feed two people.  However, since I am fat I choose to eat it all myself baby.  LOL.  Please Note:  Not all Federico's are the same.  Not all locations are fast, clean and affordable like this location.  They certainly are not priced the same.  There is one near my job and the same combo meal costs over six dollars and that does not include a free beverage.  No Bueno !  The taste and quality is just a notch below Filiberto's ( Filiberto's is the best ) but as long as this Federico's at this location keeps these awesome prices then this is my choice for fast food mexican food.

I am 33 years old and I have been going to Glendale Nine Drive-In since my mom was taking me back when I was a little one.  Now, my son, 4 years old gets to experience this awesome place !  Where else are you going to get to watch two movies for $6.50 and children under 5 free ?  No Where !  That's what makes this place special.  You can UNOFFICIALLY bring your own drinks and snacks with-out hassle but don't forget to check out their snack bar as well for all your traditional movie snacks.  Heck, we have been known to stop by Little Caesars to buy pizza and crazy bread to enjoy at the movies.  I love their DILL PICKLE only $2.  They have CHURROS also only $2.  Popcorn is decent and you can catch a free refill ( Large ) on your popcorn.  DREYERS Ice cream two scoops on a waffle cone I think for $3.50.  They also have fountain drinks which are very fresh but I am not paying $3.50 they also have bottled soda.  Prices are reasonable for their snacks and did I mentioned that on Tuesday's its family night ? $4.50 for two movies and the kids under 5 are STILL FREE !  They know take Debit / Credit Cards !  Extra Bonus !  They have arcade games and an ATM on-site.  The restroom facilities are much cleaner than years past.  Get on over to Glendale 9 and watch a movie !

My wife and I have been coming to the Glendale Nine since the 80's and now I take my six year old and he loves it just as much as me and mama.  We love to bring the truck, lay the air mattress out and cozy up in the blankets to watch our movies.  We usually stop at the nearby QT to buy our sodas and candies. We still hit up the concession stand though for popcorn, pretzels, churros and other snacks.  The Glendale Nine is a great family outing and for $7 adults and $1 for kids you get to watch two movies we usually see three though.  There are signs posted that says no drugs, no weapons and no alcohol.   However, rest assure patrons are bringing those items in. Its not uncommon to smell marijuana, see empty beer cans and hear gun shots from nearby Maryvale.  We are not bothered I grew up in Glendale so it's nothing to me and we always feel safe and we have never seen any drunken people staggering around people truly go to relax and watch a movie outside in our great Arizona weather.  On one of the comments there was a response by management stating that they do security checks.   Really?  Occasionally, I will see staff driving around in a golf cart trying to sell glow sticks but they aren't really checking on anyone per say.  They don't do car checks so you basically can bring anything you want because they are not checking.  We love the Glendale Nine and know what to expect. If you are uppity and scared of this part of Glendale then you might as well go pay top dollar at an indoor theater but trust me when I say it gets no better than Glendale 9.  Management needs to work on staffing the admission booths during high season and or popular new release movie nights such as Fast & Furious.    It is ridiculous to have one person work one booth serving two vehicles at a time.   This turns in to up to a 30 minute wait to finally purchase tickets.  Management needs to come up with a better solution. We seen vehicles turn around and leave based on the long wait.   Advice to management when you have a popular movie such as Fast & Furious on opening night maybe have dedicated admission booths for that movie.  OR  Double staff the booths even if it's just for a couple hours.  We didn't do the snack bar tonight because it was so packed and we figured if they couldn't handle all the customers trying to get in with at least a 30 minute wait then there was no way the line inside would be even the slightest more efficient.

Banner Boswell Medical Center is a great hospital.  I just completed an stay there a few days ago.  I was having chest pains and finally decided to go in because my intuition kept telling me to go.  Nonetheless, I arrived and was seen by the triage nurse promptly and was in a room and seeing a doctor within 15 minutes of arrival.  Now granted I was having chest pains which probably explains why I was seen promptly.  However, my wife had to visit the ER at Boswell twice this year and she was seen and in a room promptly as well and she didn't have chest pains.  My stay at Boswell was very pleasant and I felt confident that the doctors and the entire staff were doing everything possible such  tests and labs accordingly to determine the cause of my chest pains.  I felt safe and comfortable the entire time.  The CNA's, Nurses & Doctors and everyone involved in my care were awesome !  I would like to personally thank should they ever see this post RN Mary, Britney and Bethany and the CNA's under your supervision at the time and Dr. Fala and the other doctors for being so nice, friendly and professional.  Banner Boswell is our favorite hospital !  We always choose Boswell over Thunderbird and we live like 2 minutes from Thunderbird hospital.

My wife finally caved in today and went to Rocket Burger & Subs after hearing great things about it.  As for me personally, Eek ! Methinks not.  The burger patty was big but thin.  The fries were bascially the frozen in a bag type at your local grocery store.  Seriously !  Are you kidding me ?  Everybody knows that the fries compliment the burger and if your fries are weak that kills the burger.  My wife brags along with the other reviewers that they have 300 sodas to choose from.  To me that is just 300 ways to get diabetes.  Look, the burger was whack, the fries are the frozen variety and I could care less about 300 sodas.  Rocket Burger & Subs Eek! Methinks not.

Prepare to pay big bucks for this buffet if you go during dinner.  The price plus your drink is ridiculous especially if your buying say for a family of four.  However, if you go during lunch its more affordable and ends up being a great value.  The food is delicious depending on when you go ( last time we went at 3PM ) they had steaks, roast beef and ham in addition to chicken pizza and all the fixings including dessert and salad bar.  I am not a big fan of their salad bar.  For some reason, it just doesn't look fresh and I love salads.  I frequent the salad buffets quite frequently.  Anyways, go on an empty stomach and enjoy your buffet.  I sure do !  I don't care who stares and what they have to say LOL its a buffet and I am hear to eat especially when I pay good money for it hahaha.  In closing, if you love buffets give Old Country Buffet a try.  They are better than Hometown Buffet and definetly a little cheaper than Golden Corral.

CityScape is a joke !  The only reason why I go is because of the comedy shows.  The CVS pharmacy even closes at 9PM !    Are you kidding me ?  What's the point of being downtown if you are not going to be open late ?  CityScape is a joke but at least it does offer some entertainment that Downtown Phoenix has been lacking.

The place smells like dirty feet and socks upon arrival but that's because everyone's shoes are off.  However, during the week for $8 younger kids can jump their little hearts out all day.  Children 3 & under and approximately $4.  Great place to tire the little one's out and for the adults to chill and relax on the massage chairs.

Finally, I checked this place out. Afterall, its only a mile from my house !  I took my wife here last night for Mother's Day.  We wanted a chill place to hangout and just enjoy eachother's company.  On this night, they had a live band, not sure what kind of music they were playing, but it was good music and we really enjoyed it.  All the patrons seemed to be having a good time.  The place has been remodeled since they originally opened.  Bud bottles and drafts were only $2.74.    The wife had the tender brisket sandwich and steak fries.  I had the bacon cheeseburger with a side of potatoe salad and then we both shared a decent strawberry cheesecake.  Thunderbird Roadhouse is a decent place to hangout and enjoy a beer or a quick meal.  They have one pool table.  One dart board and I believe an arcade game.  The place was nice and clean.  They had I believe 4-5 tv's.  Our server made sure we were taken care of and checked on us frequently.  I will definetly be back when I just want to chill and relax.  The best part about Thunderbird Roadhouse is that their prices are reasonable and their food is delicious !

My wife and I went to the Ralphie May Comedy show on 2/4/12 and we had a blast.  We only paid $6 for parking as the first two hours ( $2 ) are comped by stand up live.  We purchased tickets for the 945PM show but the show didn't start until 11PM and they didn't open the doors until about 1015PM.    However, this was not a problem for my wife and I because the club actually called the day of the show at about noon advising us that Ralphie was performing longer at his shows causing the second show to be late.  So we just planned accordingly and had no problems.  Ralphie had an opening act that started at 11PM and by the time Ralphie was done with his routine it was 145AM !  So awesome because we only paid $29 per ticket ( Taxes / Fees included ) and had a great evening with Ralphie.  Additionally, there is not a bad seat in the house.  I mean obviously closer the better but when you are buying tickets on short notice its just nice to be able to get in but its also nice not to have a bad seat !  Now, the only reason why Stand Up Live does not get 5 stars from me is because of their two drink minimum and the fact that they don't disclose prices any where on the menus forcing you to ask many questions about prices if you care about your hard earned money.  Well, luckily for me I did not my research because of the many complaints about the above so at the show I knew what to expect and what I was going to pay.  They have small ass sodas in a plastic cup for $3 and Budweiser in a bottle was only $5.    We also ordered food ( Wasn't A Requirement ) and I will say their hamburgers are pretty darn delicious !  I had the bacon cheeseburger with fries and the wife had a grilled chicken with fries and they were actually priced pretty decent for a club for about $10 each.  Another complaint that this club gets is that they automatically add a 15% gratuity to your bill with no prior knowledge to you so be on the look out for that and just plan accordingly.  Our bill at the end of the night with the two drink requirement each ( wife had soda and I had Budweiser ) plus the two meals with tax and gratuity was only about $43.  I didn't give the server a tip because he already got $5.55 ( 15% ).  In closing, the couple we sat next to had a bill for $38 with taxes and gratuity and they didn't have a meal.  They had two sodas, one virgin strawberry daquirie and one martini.  When their bill came the husband said DAMN !  Exactly, they didn't ask questions.  In closing, this club is a great place to catch all the headliners that they seem to have on a regular basis.  Everybody was very nice and we will definitely be back for our next favorite headliner.  If you love stand up comedy then Stand Up Live is the place for you just don't get ripped off and ask questions about how much your drinks will because if you don't you will say DAMN too when the bill comes !

We went back to the club on 2/23 to see Mitch Fatel as we have seen him numerous times in Las Vegas.  Mitch must of been having an off night because he totally sucked on this night.  The club itself was its usual self except it was a Thursday and maybe a 1/3 full.  However, everyone inside was having a good time and that's what counts.    In our group, we had seven. We had a blast as we dranked and hung out before the show.  We spent alot of money on this night between the seven of us.  Security kept hassling us as I guess we were being too loud at times.  I can respect that.    Our server said the security guy was new and was just a dick like that anyway.  What I don't appreciate is packing us in as sardines making it very difficult to get in and out of our seats to go to the restroom and then ( Security ) griping about it because we are making too much noise and or becoming an distraction.  Our server was nice but obviously stressed out by the end of the night but to make a long story short she did make right when it came to incorrect prices etc.  Nonetheless, I filed a complaint with the club and I immediately received a response from two of the club owners.  They were apologetic and appreciated my feedback.  Matt Komen ( I believe his name is ) offered me two comp tickets and I am happy to report that I am taking him up on his offer for a show in July.  FINAL NOTE:  Stand Up Live Phoenix is a great venue for stand up comedy.  They have all the headliners and a great place next door to hang out.  The food is tasty and reasonably priced.  The drink prices are mind blowing but its a club so what do you expect.  I just hope they don't raise their prices since the Tempe Improv is going out of business.

I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.  Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.  Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.  On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.  We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.  This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !

They do have some good chicken fingers but other than that they are over-rated and over priced.  Their lemonade is excellent but they charge for refills.  Cane sauce was good.  Overall, I will not be a repeat customer.

Decided to give this location another try a several times after my last post. I can honestly say that I am truly done with this location. I still like Texas Roadhouse I just won't be visiting this location again. The "Owner" Kerry is a prick and does not care about his customers. During our last visit which was late March 2016 my wife started choking and vomiting while eating her prime rib. We did our best not to make a scene as we didn't want to gross the other patrons out. My son even almost vomited (normal reaction when you see someone else vomit). We didn't mention anything to anyone other than the server that the peanuts container needed to be discarded because of my wife vomiting in it. Afterwards, we took my wife to the ER because some of the meat was still lodged in her esophagus. Basically, she could still breathe and function but she couldn't drink or hold anything down as there was the blockage. Our family friend when she found out called Texas Roadhouse and explained to the "owner" what had happened and that since my wife and I were loyal customers as we go to Texas Roadhouse at least once a month if not twice a month for dinner passing up several streak houses along the way that it would be nice if Texas Roadhouse comped a meal for us. Keep in mind I did not know or expect that my friend called the restaurant on our behalf. She simply texted me and told me she called the owner Kerry and he wanted us to call him when she my wife was okay. Well my wife was stable and in the care of the ER department so I decided to call the owner Kerry. After waiting over 10 minutes on hold he finally gets on the phone and I tell him who I was. I told him that I was calling him because my friend had said that he asked us to call. While I was talking to Kerry I could not believe how uncaring and how such a prick he was. He said how is it his (Texas Roadhouse) responsibility for what happened. I told him we weren't looking for a hand out (complimentary meal) that I was simply calling him back per his request. I explained to him and out of respect of other customers we kept the commotion down as to not gross out the other nearby customers. Kerry was such a prick and not empathetic at all. His attitude over the phone came across that he didn't care and that I was simply bothering him. So now it is my mission that others know how the owner at this location does not care about his customers. This location is the not best at customer service anyways at least not consistently. We simply over all of our visits since this location opened chose to ignore the poor customer service, routinely having to send our meat back to be cooked the way we asked for it to be the first time. We still chose to give our business despite Black Angus having much better tasting steak and Long Horns both located next door having much better customer service. I sent an email regarding my complaint and the general manager called me back and left a voicemail asking me to call him back but I didn't bother because I am done with this location. After posting my experience on social media I will be letting corporate know as well.

Chipotle located at 16th & Camelback is a great location.  Staff are friendly, restaurant is clean and the food is reasonably priced.  I love their burrito bowls and I get extra everything for the same price.  The burrito bowl is basically everything inside the tortilla with-out the tortilla and in a bowl.  The food is fresh and makes for a great lunch option.

If you have an older vehicle that doesn't mind ARCO AM/PM gas then this is the spot.  They are usually up to 10 cents cheaper than the competition.   I paid $3.29 a gallon for unleaded last night.  Its not the cleanest store nor best of customer service but who cares?  I just want cheap gas!  My newer vehicle, Mitsibushi Galant, she hates AM/PM gas LOL she wines and groans.  My Dodge Ram doesn't seem to mind which makes me more happier than a woodpecker in an lumber yard.

This place is very huge and was one of the cleaner buffets that I have been to.  They had plenty of selections but alot of it was just repetitive.  This buffet was nothing special and I will not be returning.  We only tried it out because it was $7.99 for adults and $3.99 for children under six years old.  Plus, my brother really hyped this place up.  Price does not include beverage which is an additional $1.59.  Water is free.  This is a special promotion going on so prices are subject to change.  None of the food really hit the spot but the one highlight for me was they had plenty of fruit ( Fresh Fruit ) and plenty of desserts.  These two areas combined were probably half of the entire buffet ( Seriously ).  They had one small salad bar ( Too small ) but enough to make a decent salad.  Too many people trying to get food at the same time.  The place is too big.  Too many kids running around.  There needs to be an ordering way to getting food.    For Example:  Line Starts Here.  Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet does not live up to the hype.

My first experience with Allegiant was in 2011 from Phoenix to Springfield, MO it was a good experience.  I paid only $283 for my wife, son and I round trip.  Flight left on-time.  Got us home on-time.  We used FED EX to ship our clothes and other miscellaneous items to family in MO and then FED EX back to our home.  We still paid up to $70 with FED EX but at least we didn't have to tow tons of luggage especially with a two year old son at the time.  FAST FORWARD TO NOW:  Now their ticket office at the airport is only open 2PM to 4PM on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in MESA.  Last time, I was able to save $60 by not booking on-line and driving 45 minutes to the airport.  Now they make it difficult for you because essentially you will be stuck in rush hour traffic if your are coming in from Phoenix and on top of that the lines are going to be much longer because of the shorter hours and people wanting to save $$$.  $10 to book online per person and even per segment I believe.  ( Trust me its hard to keep track of all their fees )  I have a four year old son but unless I pay up to $13.99 per seat per segment I am not guaranteed that my wife, four year old son and I would have seats together during a flight.  So these A-Holes want me to pay up to $125.91 just to be guaranteed that I will be able to sit with my family.  However, they may allow you to preboard for free since you have a young child but ASK because my son is four now as oppose to two the last time we flew Allegiant.  They charge $35 for checked bags ( Most Airlines Do ) and their size limits are a joke so you can pretty much be assured that you will be charged $35 per checked bag per segment.  So lets say my wife and I have two bags each and my son has one that is an additional $350  So lets say they are advertising a rock bottom fare say $75 to Springfield, MO which is about 30 minutes from tourist town Branson, MO.  Sure my fare would only be $450 for a family of three but you add in all the fees mentioned above lets assume $60 to book online, $125.91 to be guaranteed that you can sit with your family and $350 for checked bags.  GRAND TOTAL: $985.91 to fly from Phoenix to Springfield, MO but remember $450 was the cost of tickets so you are paying over 50% more in fees !  BOTTOMLINE: Allegiant may not be to bad if you are flying solo maybe if its just two of you but if you are flying with a family trust me its not worth it.  With my hypothetical fare and fees above ONE would have to be an idiot to pay $535.91 IN FEES !

WINCO is a great place to do your grocery shopping.  My last two shopping trips I have spent over $200 each time but I got a lot of food !    More food then I would have spending $200 at Fry's & Safeway with their stupid shoppers card.  All the other stores better be afraid very afraid because once WINCO is done building all their stores in AZ they will become the true low price leader in the valley.  The best time to shop here is at night probably after 10PM.  However, be very careful as their floors always have debris on them and you can slip and fall like my wife did.  The employees I find to be similar to Walmart.  However, I find the employees at Walmart to be friendlier at least at the store across the street from this WINCO.  The produce tends to spoil quicker than those at the competition.  So my advice is to purchase just enough produce and eat it quickly.  We just buy a weeks supply at a time.  The bread is not the freshest and I have seen bread already moldy on the shelves so check your bread carefully before buying.  The deli and bakery don't impress me and they appear to be overpriced in that area.  Nonetheless, WINCO is as good as it gets !

We are sick and tired of this location mainly because of the doctor.  The doctor that we have seen the last two times is an old grumpy doctor.  My wife took our son in on Saturday, August 17th, 2013 at about 4PM because he has been having cold like symptoms for like 5 days and nothing was helping so we suspected an ear infection. The stupid doctor says why didn't you take your son to his pediatrican? Umm, hello, its Saturday 4PM and the office is not open hence the reason why we are here at Urgent Care and then just because my son was chewing some M&M's the doctor said how I am supposed to examine him?  Well, sheesh, I didn't study to be a doctor or anything but you wait until the boy is done chewing his M&M's and then you proceed with the examination.  The doctor is an old man, he is grumpy and I don't know if he is bitter because he should be retired and doesn't want to work but you don't treat patients like that and for that reason this Urgent Care Extra location has lost our business and we will happily take our business elsewhere.

This Kmart located at 35th Ave & Greenway has been here for years and honestly with Sears closing stores every year I can't believe this Kmart is still open.    However, I am glad it is as I have joined their shoppers reward program where you earn points on your purchases including prescriptions.  I love their bonus points offers that are printed on their receipts and sometimes advertised in their weekly ads.   For example, an offer might be make a purchase of $50 and earn 10,000 bonus points.  10,000 points equals $10!  Prescriptions are 500 points for every prescription filled.  500 points equals .50 cents.  Shop Your Way Rewards gives you points that are actually cash to use for later purchases you can't beat that.  Plus the fact that Kmart still offers lay-away year around uh yah I'm a fan !

The 99 Cent Store on 43rd Ave & Bell is as good as it gets !  They have just about anything you want or need imanginable and its only 99 cents.  They even have milk by the gallon but that is $2.59.  You can get all your staples here and supplement your grocery shopping.  The store is clean and cashiers are friendly this is definetly the best 99 Cent Store in Phoenix.

I am only giving two stars for this review because of the restaurant Coffee 24/7. We enjoyed a nice prime rib dinner which included house salad, baked potato, steamed vegetables and one roll for just $13.95 on Fri/Sat. The restaurant was clean and the servers were attentive and food came out quick.  The casino itself is acourse new, attractive and lively especially on the weekends. The floor is small and jammed pack and is difficult at times to play games both slots and tables.  They did have two $5 black jack tables open which was surprising but acourse no open seats but I didn't wait for one either.  The slots here are a freaking joke. For example, if you wanted to play a 5 cent machine the minimum bet was 30 credits ($1.50) per play and the 1 cent machines had a minimum bet of 80 credits (.80 cents) per play. Only a very few select machines had the traditional 1 credit bet. The slots here are so tight they could back up to a wall and suck out a brick.   The waitresses? What waitresses? My wife and I walked around the casino 5-10 times because its so small and we only seen one waitress serve a drink one time.  This casino is nice looking but don't be fooled the only games worth playing are the table games. The slots are tight and the 1 cent / 5 cent machines arent truly as such. They should be called the 80 cent and $1.50 slot machines.  I am not a gambler by nature. I go to casinos to relax and for entertainment but when I do play slots I want to play the traditional way. One credit at a time max bet when I choose. I couldn't even play a 5 cent slot tonight with a 5 cent voucher because the minimum is a $1.50!  Laughlin & Las Vegas is the place to go and is where I will continue to go for now on.

We tried this restaurant last night for mothers day and we enjoyed the prime rib dinner. It was delicious and came with just the right amount of seasoning. The mash potatoes were creamy, the loaded baked potatoe was just the right size. We also enjoyed the strawberry walnut salad it was definitely delicious and is a must try when you visit.  We had unlimited warm bread while waiting for our meal. Our server appeared to be new and just learning the ropes but he was very nice and friendly. He interacted with my son and overall made sure we had everything we needed. Our dessert arrived and the portion was big enough for 2-3 people to share. We will definitely be back when we want to enjoy a nice, quiet and delicious meal. Prices are just right and portions are big enough to share saving you money.

My wife and I finally signed up for Planet Fitness six months after our 24 hour fitness gym was bought out by LA Fitness.  We don't care for LA Fitness as their gyms are way too busy and crowdy. Gyms are trashy, feel dirty and looks dirty. The pool is cloudy and the spa is never clean because idiots keep getting in there all sweaty and dirty and don't shower before getting into the spa.  Anyways, back to Planet Fitness this location is clean and smells clean. Employees are always cleaning. We paid $1 and signed up for the black card membership which will be $19.99 per month and gives us access to the gym 24/7.   With our membership we get to use the massage chairs and massage aqua tables plus tanning. We get half price drinks off water and powerade plus vitamin water.   Massage chairs are five minutes per use and you get the tokens from the front desk. The aqua massage tables are good for 10 minutes but you have to go to the front desk for them to activate. I am sure you can use them both as long as you want especially after midnight. Other wise, I am told you have to reserve them per waiting list.  You get a free T-Shirt for signing up. There is free pizza first Monday of month and free bagels during first Tuesday of month.  There is also free small candy available at front desk if you need a sugar boost.  If you don't care for the massage chair/tanning/aqua massage you can skip and enjoy the gym for just $10 per month.  I love the 30 Minute and 12 minute work out stations. You get a great work out for the whole body.  No swimming pools. No hot tubs. No steam/sauna rooms but they do have large clean showers.  Planet Fitness is simple and a inexpensive way to work out and it's open 24 hours!!!!  We will be cancelling our membership at LA Fitness we don't have a contract with them.

My family and I really enjoyed this theater especially the nice and cozy leather lazy boy seats that recline! We took in the 140PM matinee show for just $5 per person you certainly will not be able to watch a new release movie with comfort for that price. The concessions are your typical high AMC prices but with your AMC stubs card you can save some money.  I would not recommend going to this theater after matinees as the theaters are rather small and I am sure real crowded hence the reserve seating.  AMC is the best value in town when it comes to your traditional theaters. Move over and catch up Harkins.
