I've been buying products from this store for well over ten years. This is the best guitar shop in scottsdale, period. Staff is very helpful and their prices beat guitar center almost every time. Their guitar repair is fair priced and excellent quality.

Five stars does not do this store enough justice. Everyone who works here is incredibly knowledgeable and very willing to help. I'll never purchase my home brew products anywhere else.

First and foremost, they roast their own beans. Any coffe shop who roasts their own beans has a real passion for the product. The feel of the place is very hipster, yet rugged, and very easy to stay engaged when looking for a place to do homework or have a meeting.   One thing that really astounded me about this place is the simplicity of the menu. A simple yet quality selection is best in my opinion. From their mocha to just a plain old cup of joe, their drinks are delicious! They make a mean Toddy as well....

There are two reasons this place isn't getting one star. The fact that this place is a Broncos bar, and the fact that the service was decent. Other than that, this place is an utter disappointment. It tries to be a pub by day, and a night club after dark, but the music during the day is too loud to hear the person right next to you much less the game. The food is over priced, under portioned, and very poorly plated. The $10 nachos we ordered were sprinkled with a skimpy-at-best portion of cold, unmelted cheese. If all you want to do is get too drunk to care about the price or quality of your food while dancing to terrible music, this place is for you. If you actually want to watch football, stick to the real sports bars.
