Rooms are so beautiful and the grounds offer great romantic walks. The bed is so comfy. I wanted to take that bad boy home. Little benches and reading areas. 24/7 pool and hot tub   Cons:   Checkin slow waited over 10 minutes before someone even said hello. When I booked no mention of 30 a NIGHT resort fee.  Supervisor on sift could Cate less spoke with GM and she waved but ONLY after walking her through booking and proving wasn't mentioned. I would stay again on a special date but with such a high resort fee too high too stay a week for vacation.

I had the best experience with a gentlemen name Christopher Melendrez. He works for a company named Prospect who contracts with the airport. I have an injury that required I use a wheel chair. Christopher was my pusher. He was so pleasant. When we went through secuirity he offered to open my bag and get out the liquids to be scanned. After inspection He returned everything neatly to my bag. He asked me every time we passed a restroom if I needed to stop. Then when we got near the gate he offered to stop by one of the resturants so I could get breakfast. Which we did. Christopher made sure to get me everything I needed for my meal. After, getting me to the gate he went to the desk to make sure my chair would be waiting in my layover city and too top it off he came back near boarding time to offer to help me board and put luggage in overhead. What an outstanding employee. His customer focus should be used as a training tool across all airports. My hats off too Christopher!

Horrible horrible horrible customer service! I'm hosting an event in Scottsdale Arizona and I chose this hotel as the host hotel. I was told they had shuttle service. I went down when I arrived and set up shuttle services for that event and gave them the name of the business and where it was located. I thought it was all set up and I went to confirm it and the hotel said they would not honor the shuttle service cuz they shuttle within five miles and it was 6.5 miles away. I would understand if they didn't already set it up and tell all our guests that they can use this service but now they refused to honor the original commitment. I ask that the representative call the general manager and she did and the general manager refused to speak to me about it just said that they would not honor it. I have never had a general manager not willing to speak to a guest and especially someone that has 15 rooms in your hotel! I will be leaving this review on every review site I could think of and I will be encouraging all of my guests to do the same. I will never use this brand hotel again

Horrible customer services came through drive auto machine came on asking to pull up to next order spot. Then no one ever answered. I pulled up to window and the lady ignored me. She clearly was avoiding customers it was only 1030 pm. They really need to get there service together. We went down the road to Wendy's it was so good.

What a mess of a hotel. General Manager Jim is a joke. I had a horrible stay here. The rooms are nasty and I was in a new one. So, they say! I called and left 4 messages for manager GM to call me and never did. Hotel told me they were not charging me and still did. Filed BBB complaint didn't respond (They have a F rating with bbb.  I called and asked if they had an owner or corporate office I could speak too and they said No the owner lives in New Zealand. What a load of ... Finally, had to call bank and have them stop payment.

So, since my review I have yet to receive a follow up from the business I have filed an attorney general's complaint due to how I was treated and lied to and condition of hotel. I'm assuming I will receive a response from that complaint although I can't be certain sense the company didn't respond to better business complaint.  all in all I would avoid this place at all cost!  They treat customers awful and the hotel isn't in a condition it should be open.

This was so disappointing.  We were in Casa  Grand because my fiancee had a show for a local charity.  The show was an all nighter. So, the only place to grab a small bite to eat was at this AmPm. So, when we walked in we wasn't greeted.  Next, I head for the bathrooms and they just haven't been taken care of, all it would take is wiping everything down and they would be acceptable (see pictures attached) . Next, we start looking for snacks the shelfs were a mess (see picture) and the condiment bar only had one serving device for about 15 products (see pictures). When we initially checked out the guy was short and didn't say thank you or have a nice night. We went out and had a seat in the out door seating which was clean well lit. I decided to go back in and get one more item and a customer was waiting at the service desk and the two service people in the back and the older one was cursing like a man meeting the in laws. She finally yelled you have customers; the older gentleman came back he didn't say anything to either one of us. All he gave us was total and no" thank you, come again" or anything. I was very disappointed with the service here. I hate giving 1 star, so I'm going to return when I'm back in town. I want too see if this was just a rouge team member or just a poorly run store.
