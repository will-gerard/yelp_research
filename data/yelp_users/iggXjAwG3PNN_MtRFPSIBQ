There's about 10 minutes of things  I like about Roscoe's:  It's a good place to go for darts and a beer, and the music is above average before it gets worse.   With that, I'm already out of things I like, so I suggest you spend no more than that here and leave.     I only went to meet friends, and a good friend at that.  I would have passed any other time.     I order a Stella on draught, served right, even in the Stella glass.  They do know how to serve beer and other alcoholic drinks here, like, in the strictest sense of being able to pour a non-skunked brew or a strong cocktail in the right glass.   Not much else, unfortunately.  $4.75, the bartender tells me.  I hand him my Visa.    "It's cash only."     My vision blurs as I strain to quell my irritation as we're already off to a great start.  I should have left right there, but that would have probably been illegal and the Stella looked pretty good.    I take out a $20 from the ATM, the last ATM in Arizona that still dials out. So I spent my time waiting looking for skimmers because nobody else would have noticed one in a place this cheap.     I like paying $5 in fees for a $5.75 beer.   I really do.   (With tip, as its not his fault his job sucks.)  As I find out, I pulled the last $20 out of the ATM before it *ran out of money.*  If I intended on pulling more out to lessen the 25% tax on my cash, I would've been doubly irritated.    So when the bartender switches the policy from "cash only" to "we take plastic" after I just went out of my way and money to comply...I didn't know there was another reason I don't want to go back but the morons who run this place figured one out.    The stale-beer-and-sweat smell was getting to me by the time my friend needed a cigarette.   But forget seeking your respite on their "patio."      Their "patio" is more like a planemullkip, a word I had to just make up from the German translation for "a tarp stretched over a garbage dump."    No prior English word better describes this pathetic joke--It smells worse outside, there's no furniture, but there is plenty of garbage and you can't even take your drink out.  Maybe it's intentional--they've duplicated being just as cheap, annoying, and lazy on the outside as they have inside.   The tiny bathroom that forces everyone to watch you take a dump is just like the rest of the place:  all the charm and appeal of a rural county lock-up, right down to the same suicide-proof sheet-metal toilet.  Even if you get off on this sort of thing despite the many inherent travesties, go elsewhere.    Incidentally, I really like setting my coaster on top of my drink and adjusting it so just in case one of the creepy trolls here GHB's my drink, I'll notice.  A use permit is something like $500 from the city for outdoor alcohol  consumption, and they might pay that much in fencing.   Instead, I just I don't get it.  I first went here 7 years ago and I can tell they've made about $300 in capital improvements since then, all from Goodwill.  Outside lives a $30 heater, they have a $150 website, and $100 for a used LCD or two.   One of the LCDs was displaying a completely different faded illegible picture than the one on the same channel next to it, putting the rampant cheapness here in striking contrast to the one new thing that worked--the jukebox probably wasn't theirs and didn't work either.   Who even knew you could get a website from Goodwill?  The last $20 they must have spent is for the annoying plastic flaps they hang on the back door to lessen their AC bills.   This place reeks of cheap.  And not in a good way like a cheap beer, the sort of thing I'll tolerate a lot for.    Roscoe's is cheap like "you've got to be kidding me" cheap or "the smell just made me throw up in my mouth" cheap, both of which negate any benefit of cheap beer.   Rocoe's survives on two things:  being the one gay sportsbar in town and being the one thing to do on a Tuesday night.     So I give it a 2 out of 10.  It covers its bases, but that's it.   I'll say it a third time.  Even if you like that sort of thing, just go elsewhere.

I've been going here more than any place I can imagine coming up on five years.  I tell people when I used to go there on a Sunday, there was me, a homeless person lingering about, someone from the old folks home across the street, and Mike.  Mike is still there, along with damn near everyone else now.   My Circle K has become a circus ... K.  hah!  *slaps knee*  But this review is for Mike, the heart and soul of the American blue collar veteran from Chicago transplanted here to the melting pot of the melting pot of the melting pot of the melting pot--America, Arizona, Downtown Phoenix, this Circus K on 1st Ave.    Thanks to Mike, my formerly lonely outpost in the urban desert of Downtown survives as "the busiest circle K in the state," itself a microcosm of its surrounding neighborhood.    I salute you, Mike.  And I second the comment that this place could be a reality show.  You don't get a better slice of life than here.  They could even license the Circus K name off me.    OK, I'll stop.    Every other employee here is awesome.  Assane runs late nights like a tribal king.  Deu didn't know his shit in the beginning but is a testimony to the raw gumption of the hard-working recent immigrant.  I've been wanting to buy Kevin a beer for a while.  Get to know Super Dave, who actually has that on his name tag.  And then there's the sheepish guy from the vicinity of the Indian subcontinent that would eyeball my ID over and over until he stopped doing that.    If you go late at night, you can chat it up with the security guard and the bedraggled man enjoying something out of tupperware that has also started becoming a fixture.  If I weren't living downtown, I'd miss this place.  That's really weird for a Circle K.    I'd give my local K-hole five stars, but the frosters don't work much in the summer (go to 7th Ave and Roosevelt for that) and the pass-thru period starts at midnight.

The fact that Local Breeze and I share an alley is probably #1 on my list of why I love living where I do in Downtown Phoenix.    It's actually Local Breeze Patio Cafe, so let's start there.    You'd be hard pressed to find a better patio in Phoenix.  I've eaten here at all times of the year and they manage to keep the outdoor temperatures perfect.  Fire pits when it's cold  and large outdoor air conditioners when it's hot moderate the temperatures amidst a lush, green oasis.  A full outdoor bar and all the comfortable seating arrangements  make this a perfect hang out spot for a group.  I can't wait till downtown builds up some more, making this hideaway an even more special place.   Inside is a little spartan, but the local artist's works on the  walls tells you this place is right in tune with Downtown Phoenix.  The front of house is a bit shaky, but they compensate with a friendly staff.    I usually save the review of the bathroom till the end, but you MUST see it.  I don't know of another restaurant where I would actually ask the server to show you the opposite gender's room.  Left over from Palatte, they are jaw-droppingly beautiful walk-in functional art projects that must be seen to be believed.    I'm not a breakfast person by nature, but I will seriously stay up so I can get it here.   Breakfast here is easily the best I've had, beating Matt's Big Breakfast by a longshot.   The bread put all others to shame--extremely generous and as good as you would expect for being baked in house.   The country potatoes are an 11/10.  The challah is a meal in and of itself.    I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've had about three-quarters of it and the Fire Island is the best so far.    That being said, they lose their 5th star largely because the spicy dishes just aren't spicy.  I've talked about it with the owner--it's spicy for the "average person," who I'm guessing is a lot like my mom who starts sweating midway through a mild curry dish.   Upon their advice, I've asked to kick it up a notch or two on the spicy marinated sandwich, and it just didn't work out the way I wanted.     The one thing that could have the kick here I was looking for is the Atomic burger, which I guess wasn't made right--a big bite there was getting there, a big bite elsewhere put me in tears.    Still damn good tho.  Come to Local Breeze hungry.  I once gorged on 5 lbs of stroganoff over an hour and a half once, finishing it off and still a bit hungry.  But Local Breeze is what tuned me into quality food--food that's actually good for you.  Most things I get here turn into two meals which is perfect as I'm on a budget like everyone else.      Three freaking hours after eating three-quarters of Sid's tuna sandwich and some of the salad, I'm still stuffed.  I don't know how the hell they do it.    They unfortunately don't have draft beer here, but the bottled selection is generous.  I'm not big into liquor, but I've obviously had enough of it in my day, and just like their breakfast Local Breeze gets best in the city for their house cocktails--they're just that well made.  One is easily enough for most people.  I can drink like a rhinoceros and having two means a great night.    I need this place to be open as much as possible because I wouldn't know what to do without it.  Literally.  I can't cook and hate driving, so I come here as often as possible.  But since Pita Jungle opened up, business has been slow at Local Breeze.  They've reduced their hours and I'm genuinely worried for my solid fixture of the Roosevelt neighborhood.  I am eagerly anticipating their new dinner menu and hope it's just what reminds all of Phoenix's foodies that Local Breeze is a good part of what make our downtown dining scene the best in the Valley.    9/10.

I'm torn on this rating.  Two stars is "Meh, I've experienced better.", and I have.  Three stars is "A-OK", which it  was.    Had the manager not compensated me for the ridiculously small plate of ribs I got, this review would be scathing.  But he did make it mostly right and that went a long way towards fixing the overall experience to a third star.  But two things about the third star:  I shouldn't have to feel like a cheapass by wondering if I got a full rack or a half rack.  The food didn't feel like anything special, which would have been acceptable if the prices were far lower.     Two stars it is.    Our party arrived on a Friday night--we were in the area, a little lost for a good place to go.  I remembered this place as a good hangout spot on a weekday night, which it definitely is.  Tonight, we were seated promptly and never waited very long for anything--the service was fast and top-notch.   However, i'm having difficulty with this whole hipster thing where the wait staff dresses in  street clothes.  It weirds me out and it's almost insulting for as expensive as the place is.    I totally dig the overall ambience.  The restaurant itself appears to be in a rehabbed auto mechanic's shop, creating something totally unique in a region of unique rehabs.  The comfortable patio hangs right off Central Avenue, creating a rare big-city kinda place in Phoenix.  The fire pit is just cool, they play good and fun music.   Ambience is about the one thing about this place that actually lines up with the price, contributing solidly to Uptown's burgeoning vibe.  The beer selection felt weak.  We didn't order cocktails, so I can't comment on that.    Going through our courses....The potstickers were good, but the thai peanut sauce just tasted weird.  The spicy edamame was an interesting twist but I didn't find myself very hungry for it   My friend ordered the cajun burger which he thought was "mediocre."  I ordered what turned out to be the smallest full rack of ribs in Arizona described above--the mango to the sauce was too slight leaving it fairly generic, altho the fries and slaw were pretty good.   The meat, yeah I wolfed it down, but in the end it didn't seem like anything to write home about.    The food and drink, all in all, felt more or less average.  The problem with average is in how much this place charges--I'm not going to give three stars to an expensive restaurant that serves three star food.     Given the other choices in the area that I still need to try out, I don't see much of a reason to come back for dinner again.

The new Pita Jungle freaking rocks. I haven't been to one in years, but I can see them quickly becoming a new favorite.   Ambience gets an 8.5 so far.    I'd have to spend more time in the inside and see the bathrooms to finalize it. but it was pretty kicking Monday night at 7:30 three days after their opening with a lively crowd--somewhat unusual and definitely welcome for Downtown.  Good parking right off the patio was open during my two hours there.   But we walked there, taking our seats in the patio in the back after a friendly greeting with the bartender.  The *full bar* window sits *very nicely* between the inside and patio which combined make a very un-Phoenix like setting, something I'm really fond of getting used to downtown.    Inside, I was instantly taken aback by the pleasant configuration of the cavernous interior.  I soberly staggered about, grinning idiotically.  Its a use of space that easily beats the last tenant, a fly-by-night home-foreclosure help-line.  I didn't miss the always-closed design firm that was there before either.    I admit my continued giddiness.  Outside was comfortable and quiet for the most part except for the occasional headlight glare.  We were the only ones seated on the spacious patio.  But it wasn't isolated; foot traffic from folks driving up, walking in like they weren't from the neighborhood along with folks who lived next door--all nice people--added to the pleasant urban dichotomy of entrances in front and back.  Service gets a 9.5/10.   Our position outside in view of the bar made it easy to be seen, so I can't say the same for the inside but have high expectations.    The staff should read the directions/learn how to turn the heater on instead of depending on the later arrival of the one bestowed with that knowledge.  I'm guessing enough restaurant patrons would have just gotten colder and more irritated while they waited, I'm not that kinda guy.  I chocked it up to an opening day jitter and pushed both buttons in.  The food came out wicked quick, and the super cute waitresses were friendly, patient, and otherwise on top of everything.     A phone call before we left was answered promptly and courteously.  They said they were "not busy", but were crowded when we walked in, suggesting they know how to deal with traffic.    Food gets an 8/10.   To start off, it was $5 for what I think was 20oz of a perfect Devil's Ale:  a fun, big glass with a handsome head...Drink me, it begged, and I happily obliged.  Served cold, it warmed me right up.  If a buck (or two? please?) were off the beer and the joint stayed open till 4 AM...it'd be a madhouse.  We can dream, but I doubt the looming apartments would enjoy that kind of big city vibe off the patio.      In the meantime, they could have had more warm drinks besides the tasty hot chocolate for the winter. Lola Coffee next door could hopefully provide some of that vibe for some real synergy if they stayed open later.  The tzatziki put me in food paralysis--a heavenly feeling I get when I first take a bite of something and it's that amazingly good all other senses shut off.  I kind of wondered at the better part of $8 for my companion's small pesto pizza with no meat but it too was a 10/10.  The beef gyro was some points lower, I seem to recall enjoying its selection of stock greens (I just killed it this morning as I write this),  but the meat was average and a bit lacking on the sauce.  Either way, they  made up for it with a hearty, filling portion that should be an easy standby for any carnivore, especially one on a budget...   ... but take the gyro by itself.   It doesn't quite work next to its $3 up-sell garlic potatoes which were mediocre in the beginning and went cold quick.  Skip 'em.   Still, the potatoes along with everything else wait in my fridge for the next day like everything else I took home.  Shouldn't be too hard to give them enough kick again in a toaster oven or microwave.  The rice pudding was served cold and average on its own (maybe that's the point?), but it was definitely enlivened with the right amount of cinnamon and half the amount of fresh fruit they put on top.  Total bill was $36 before tip. For appetizer, main course, dessert, and beverage for two in such a expletively awesome place, it's definitely worth it.   As a quick dinner to go, it's a major, major reason to not hit the local fast food joints in the late evenings too.  8.8 out of 10 for my best luck to the latest addition downtown, the newest for all of 4 days before Vitamin T opens up.    What bad economy?  I sometimes wonder. =)

A five-star rating is not to be thrown around lightly.    A five-star restaurant has to deliver on all the bases, and Bliss/reBAR do just that.    Service:  Everytime i've ever been here the staff has been ridiculously nice, patient, and friendly.    Ambience:  They've been dinged on the music before, agreeably--the dance onslaught from Fez is fun for a little while before it gets old quick.  So they threw it out.  "We're not a club, we're a house in an arts district" the barkeep saucily proclaimed to my delight.  The mix has something for everyone and is unlike anything in Phoenix.  The patio is a little industrial, lacking some green, but that's after *trying* to find something wrong with this place.  It's well apportioned with comfortable furniture, heaters, and a giant bar landmarking the corner.  A panoramic view of downtown looms with almost every tower visible across the smattering of vacant lots and buildings on the border of the commercial core, putting the urban clusterfucks of downtown Phoenix in a stark, beautiful contrast to one another.   Probably not for long as the two blocks across 4th Street will likely be a construction site soon enough.    Inside, the challenge of fitting a commercial space into a house is met with every expectation.  The restaurant side is packed in and cosmopolitan, the bar side is like the Steampunk interpretation of a neighborhood saloon.    The bathrooom is like a Madison Avenue space station--practical, clean, and sophisticated.    Food:  I've found every item I've tried:  porkchops, tacos, burgers, salads to be sheer awesome.  The $5 to go menu--"Bliss Boxes"-- should be seriously considered by anyone on a budget.    Drinks:  They're all about the deal here.  $3 pints of GOOD beer make this place an awesome endcap to any weeknight.  Inventive cocktails that are poured as they should be.  Bliss and reBAR get it and add wonderfully to the dynamic downtown Phoenix restaurant scene.  10/10.

House cocktails are now unbelievably weak and overpriced in the five years I've written my review.    Like, so weak and overpriced that I've now ordered the most expensive drink I will have ever ordered (and I live in one of the western hemisphere's most expensive cities now) and it still wasn't worth it.      An $8.50 pour for Phoenix should be half giving me the bottle, instead, it didn't make a dent.   A bottle of Smirnoff, no less--so their profit margins are something like 90% on the alcohol itself.    I'm not sure if I'll be returning over the holidays next time.

I had a hankering for a better burger than typical fast food, and Five Guys was in the neighborhood and worthy of a first time check out.  And it is, if you haven't been before.    But despite the rave restaurant reviews utterly plastered on almost every open space on the wall, this place is totally overrated.      The burger wasn't bad.  I dig all the fix-ins you can put on them, but it makes for a pretty messy eating experience.    Unfortunately, the burgers are way overpriced for what they really are--as another reviewer put it it, it really is a step up from Carl's Jr.    I ordered what should have been a "pretty big" burger and it said I got two patties on the receipt, but in retrospect I think I got shorted cause the second one was much bigger.     Whatever the case, after two $6 burgers, I was still hungry.   That shouldn't happen in fast food places like this.  In-N-Out is twice the good deal this place is.      I did not try the fries... I thought I ordered them, but in fact did not because I didn't shout that I wanted fries.  Five Guys is annoyingly loud.   Some day I will understand the onslaught of overplayed classic rock played in practically every eating establishment these days.  It's getting annoying, especially when it causes order fuckups.   The service was quick and really friendly.   And I like the free peanuts.   It makes me think my two-star rating is a little low, but the soda machine tasted like soap and some bedraggled man took his sweet time in the *one* bathroom they had available.      And ultimately, it is an expensive burger that would have been forgettable if I didn't have a particular fondness for A-1 sauce and 'shrooms.  I could only see myself going again if I were stuck on the corner, needed to eat quick, already ate at Chipotle's, and had some money to burn, all of which are a stretch for me, but probably not  the upper middle-classed downtown lunch crowd.     And that lunch crowd must be exactly this place's target market--with all of the above being said, you're probably not going to find a better, quicker burger within a short walk from the Washington St office towers.  The plethora of fast convenience stores on the ground floor of Block 77, brought to us by CityScape's cynical over-commercialism, is not without its utility to some people.    For anybody else, I wouldn't bother a second time.    3/10.

An interesting little surprise on a First Friday--the electric blue neon letters spelled out my beacon when searching for something to drink.    Small businesses don't get much smaller.  Inside is about as unassuming as you can get.  The bar splits the old duplex's front room in a strictly utilitarian fashion.  Bottles of Monin flavor syrup crowd one side, a vintage ice machine near a single cash register and a small hand-drawn menu on the wall round the place out.     The raw entrepreneurial spirit that adds to the late night fare downtown can be pretty inspiring sometimes, and I'm kicking myself for not doing it first.  I reasoned downtown didn't need another coffee shop, and I was proven wrong with a place that fills a void I didn't know existed.  What I like about this place is what's not here.  There are no knick-knacks to up-sell, nothing that beckons the over-done scenes found at coffeehouses elsewhere.  There's nothing to take away from a kickass cup of coffee when you want it except what appeared to be a delightful-looking waffle-cone carried out of the back.    The place was *swamped* on First Friday, but despite the rush it never once felt claustrophobic.  The line shuffled quickly, and my drink was made lickety split, faster than other coffee shops that have a fraction of the crowd.  It arrived so fast, I actually didn't believe it was mine, especially when it seemed the barista was new.  A good sign for his future there.    The cashier was friendly and we welcomed each other to the neighborhood.  She made sure I got my 10th JoBot Free card.    But you know what the best part was?   I casually noted the price of the large $4 latte.  I can't drink cow's milk, so I get soy.  And coffee is just boring without a flavor shot.    Anywhere else I go, that "$4" drink is at least $6.  At JoBot, it was still $4.    When she told me that, I had been repeatedly counting my dollar bills, pondering the final damage of my add-ons.  Needless to say, I didn't believe her.    Practically everything has its catch, its obnoxious little down-side.    Except JoBot.  Thank you Mr. Sagasta.  10/10.

I see no reason to ever eat here again.   They add *nothing* to the eating scene anywhere and in fact tremendously detract from it.   Because of this place, I'm going to have to add to my list of "Signs You Need to Eat Somewhere Else."     Rule:  If there are photographs of the food on the wall at an American restaurant you're probably in the wrong place.   To be sure, the quality of the photography will be inversely proportional to the quality of the food.  If the guy's son made it with a point and shoot, stay.  If there was a contract to Industrial Light and Magic, as must have been the case here, leave immediately.    Rule:  The number of registered trademarks you encounter  is inversely proportional to how long you should stay.  Jimmy John's has like 17 trademarks on their name alone.  The joke must be on them--their lawyers have conned them into spending a fortune to protect a concept nobody in their right mind would ever steal.    I poured over their menu before deciding on the Bootlegger Club.  Maybe I was hoping with a name like that it might border on the cutting edge, maybe it'd be so good it'd be illegal.    I told them what I wanted.  I said "everything but onions" twice and listed the specific ingredients twice.  Yes, I did want oregano.  That's five times now.    The sandwich was the biggest culinary disappointment in recent memory.  If you're wondering how they sell sandwiches for cheap, it's by putting nothing on them that's worth anything.    I'm looking at the picture of a sandwich on the wall while I attempt to figure out what the hell I got.  This isn't just McDonald's dressing up a shellacked hunk of ceramic for their marketing--Jimmy John's is a blatant lie.  The sandwich on the wall was overflowing with meat.  Mine was overflowing with iceberg lettuce.  The wall sandwich had many slices of meat, mine had about two.      The *only* thing that had any flavor in my sandwich was the spartan accompaniment of mustard.    When I ate it, I was missing Yaz Deli, the immigrant/family-run standby  when I worked in the same building.  He got all his shit from Costco and put together a meal with four times the value this place ever could.  That guy spoke a hundred words of English but never once remotely fucked up my order like I got here.    I was missing Subway, and I didn't know that was possible.  Subway wouldn't have been the waste of money Jimmy John's is.    I might have even justified my single star because this place does keep many people employed, two that were extremely good looking.  It's overflowing with attitude and Gourmet and instructions to enjoy myself, but I just cannot fathom how I am supposed to.  There are far better potential uses of the space it occupies in the building.  It's not worth the sales-tax revenue to a cash-strapped city.  It is a travesty that it occupies such a significant corner downtown.  Your money should be spent elsewhere.   "Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted."   read a sign on the wall.  I will let all the ironic volumes of bullshit in that speak for itself.    -2 out of 10.
