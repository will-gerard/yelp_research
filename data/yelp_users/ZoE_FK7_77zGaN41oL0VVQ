This place is the only reason why I miss living in Vegas.  It's myf avorite italian joint in the whole wide world.  They have the best pizza, lasagna, everything!  The deli rocks and the desserts are so delish!  I miss this place so much!!!

Yes, it's a corny 50's diner and the wait staff dancing and singing is HIGHLY annoying BUT the food rocks.  Well I was heavily intoxicated and the grilled cheese sandwich I had was amazing.    Drunk food = good food.

I like this place a lot.  The room was nice, beds were comfortable and the shower rocked.  This place is rocks and yes, it's not in the middle of everything but it's close enough to walk to the Sahara to catch the Monorail and you're good to go.    We were treated great by the staff and the dealers/pit bosses were fun and helpful to all of our gambling questions.    I'm a fan and will totally return to this place.

This is my favroite buffet in Vegas.  When I lived there, I would go here all the time.  It's cheap as you get in early!!    I've only been here for breakfast but I love it.  Get there before 10AM and it's only $12.99 I think.    So yummy!!!

I had high expectations of this place and was quickly disappointed.    The meat was all pretty much dry.  The pork with pineapple was the only thing that was any good.    I am not a fan by any means now.....  Pros: We were seated quickly  Service was fantastic  Cons: Dry meat Overpriced

I've been to Black Bears throughout California and this one was not nearly as good as the others.    The biscuits were hard and dry and I just was not that happy with our breakfast here.   The portions are still crazy big but the quality of food and what you pay more just aren't what I had expected.    If you are going to be a chain restaurant of sorts, everything should be consistent and this location is definitely not compared to others....

It's cheap, it's a bed & a shower and COLD A/C.  It's right off the freeway and for $30, can you REALLY complain?  We got here a little past midnight a couple days ago and the staff was way nice and even though I had to wait in line in the blistering heat, I was in my room within a few minutes.
