Not sure if this is new, but its cash only. It would have been nice to know that before I drove to it, sat down, and was ready to order. The polite waitress told me where the nearest atm was but it wasn't a bank and I didn't feel like paying a fee to withdraw $ and then go back. Two people were in there eating by themselves at the peak of lunch hour. For what its worth, their food looked pretty good. Maybe I will try again when I happen to be in the neighborhood with cash. Just wanted to post this to give anyone the heads up to bring cash.

My work pc crashed last month and I took it to data doctors. They informed me of the costs and what would be involved in repairing it, and how long it would take. When I got the pc back, it was as good as new!!! they recovered all data and explained in detail what they would have to do while they had it. I also LOVE the radio show and their facebook page. Informative information!!!

Never had a bad meal here and I eat here a LOT. it's much better than bar food. Prices are very reasonable and they have a $6.95 soup and sandwich every weekday for lunch.

I work just around the corner from this place so I go there fairly often recently. For my money, it is the best. Very reasonable rates and you don't have to mess with a membership, so I can go often when I can, but then may not go for months. I have seen 3 different massage therapists over the past year and all 3 have been fantastic. I don't even request a particular therapist because I know whoever is working will be be great. I prefer smaller, local businesses. I don't have anything against those large chains, but I'd rather go here. Have been going for a year and a half and have zero complaints. I often walk in since I work so close, but they do get busy so I would suggest calling for an appointment. There's no need to spend what the fancy spa's charge to get an incredible massage.

I'm not buying these reviews. I RARELY bother reviewing places because I like to give a place the benefit of the doubt. Like, maybe it was an off night. However, I took 2 of my sons here for dinner tonight. The food itself was fine (brisket not great though). We got there at 5:20. They finally took our order at 5:40. We got our 2 meals (I shared with my youngest boy) at 6:30. There were 5 tables in total and this is the type of food that has to have been made already. There was a cook and 2 servers on a Saturday at dinner time. Since there weren't many people though, I still can't figure out what took so long. They didn't check on us once in the 50 minutes that we sat there, waiting on our food. There were only 2 sets of silverware so I actually went and got one. My son had to flag down someone to ask for more water. It was just not any ace I'd return to, especially considering it was $53 with tax and tip, and we had 2 meals and a small salad. Now, to be fair to the servers, they were kids, so I'm not really blaming them.  They were obviously inexperienced and I'm sure they have no control over the food prep time. There's too many decent barbecue joints in the area to waste your time here. One last thing....... At least 3 different people came in for carry out while we waited and they all appeared to leave unhappy. It looked like one wrong order and 2 that had to wait 20to 30 minutes for an order that was supposed to be ready.

Didn't even know this place was here. Stopped by when I noticed it. Nothing fancy, but I had a great meal. I had the filet mignon kabob. Cooked exactly how I ordered and the staff couldn't ha e been more friendly. I'll definitely be back. Also, the baklava was great.
