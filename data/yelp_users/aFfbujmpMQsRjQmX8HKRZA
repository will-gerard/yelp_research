The bread sticks are good. The pasta is disgusting. It came out very overcooked. The noodles were so mushy and disgusting it was almost liquid and I'm pretty sure the chicken is not actually chicken. And apparently you don't get marinara sauce with your bread sticks. Who doesn't dip bread sticks in sauce? At least if you don't give one out with our order let us know while purchasing that its extra if wed like marinara which I'm guessing most people do when they order bread sticks.  Terrible customer service. The girl was talking on her cell phone the entire time she put my bread sticks together no wonder the pasta was over cooked and cold. 2 thumbs down for this location. Pizza hut is normally very good.
