Jennifer Swink has been doing my facials/microderms/dermaplaning for years.  She is the best.  She really knows what she is doing.  Give her a try!

By far the BEST blowout I've ever had.  Not sure how Shannon can do what she does with my hair but I LOVE her.  Way better stylists than that "other" blow dry place.

Not good. Service was not good. Waiter didn't listen to our order and the pizza sauce was way too sweet. Toasted divinci sandwich was good
