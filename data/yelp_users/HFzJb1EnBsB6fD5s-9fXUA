I am not a huge Teriyaki fan and this place was coming up as a sushi place on Yelp for a while now but was always closed. As most of you know, there are barely any sushi places down town so when I was home for the week last week I finally had the chance to head out to this place.  I wasn't disappointed that there was barely any sushi, I decided to go with the beef teriyaki instead. Holy smokes! Super yum! I haven't had teriyaki that was this good, ever!.  I will go back more and more and stuff myself silly. Love it.  I highly recommend it.

I had been to Ichi Ban about 2 years ago and I was not at all impressed with the quality of the sushi. The rice wasn't too good, was not good on sushi but I'm sure it could have been good with some teriyaki on it! The rolls are way too over priced. 9 dollars for a philly? Really? Maybe if the rice was good and the fish tasted fresh but, nope. The most I'd pay for a philly here is 6.50. They also seemed to skimp on the size of the rolls.  It's a shame because they could have SO much more business if they dropped the prices a bit and worked harder at making better rice since there are barely any sushi places downtown.

I had been to Cooperstown before and thought the food was "ok". I had ordered a pulled pork sandwich that was way too big and costs way too much. I didn't think I'd be back. However, I was babysitting my friends nephews this weekend and we both though it would be a hoot to tell the 5 year old we are going to grab a hot dog.  He is a picky eater so we didn't feed him lunch and when he said he was hungry we headed on over to Cooperstown.  We ordered our sodas and the 5 year old drank his in about 2 minutes. When we asked him if he wanted a hot dog he decided against it...bummer! So we ordered him a couple of sliders and the other nephew got the Mike Myers.  Me and my friend ordered the hot dog just to see what the 5 year old thought.  Anyway, along comes the food. The 5 year old said "What the heck is that? That's a really big hot dog!". And that was that.  The other nephew, age 12, got his Mike Myers and took about one bite out of it. He didn't like it much and I don't really blame him. I examined the sandwich only to find that the BBQ sauce on it was all dried up on the meat. The grilled pork loin appeared to be the only fresh meat on the sandwich. Ah well, 14 dollar sandwich down the drain.  The 5 year old took a tiny bite out of his dry hamburger slider and ate a couple of fries. The fries were just like Burger King fries...not so yummy.  Me and my friend started eating the hot dog which had shredded cheese, bacon and pickles. Each side is a dollar, by t he way. Anyway....it tasted good for the first few bites but after that I was overwhelmed by the saltiness of the hot dog. Way too salty.  50 dollars later I walked out with 3 take home containers and 4 people that were still hungry because they couldn't eat the food.  On to the ambiance; they sat us very close to the entrance/exit to the kitchen which is also near the bar. They had 4 TV's going and the music was blaring. We couldn't even hear each other talking.  I don't know why they had to have the music so loud...it was just annoying.  Oh, and I had to pay 5 bucks to park since there was something going on downtown....what a pain.  I really think I am going to steer clear of this tourist trap from here on in. If you want some really good BBQ, head to Bobby Q's up north.

This place is right down the street from my home so I visit pretty often. The employees are pretty quiet but they do remember what I want every time I go in. They close a little early for my taste but I would too if I owned my own store. So, if you live in the area, hit up your local business rather than the Circle K's that are on every corner.

Sometimes you wake up in the morning with an insatiable need to have a doughnut....last weekend was one of those mornings.  The doughnuts here are pretty good. I come from Boston where even D&D has delicious doughnuts so it's hard to please me when it comes to the beautiful circles of soft sweetness. However, these do the trick I guess.  My favorite are the honey glazed of course.  If you go early they are still pretty warm!  I'd recommend them.

I actually liked the food here. The beef was flavorful and not dry at all and the chicken was good as well.  The waitress gave us some chips and salsa but I was surprised that they didn't bring over any Pico.  Ah well.... The horchata was pretty good so I would recommend that too.  The decor is pretty interesting. They have these super heavy chairs that are very uncomfortable so be prepared!  I would have stayed longer and maybe ordered more food but there was a baby crying his little head off the whole time I was there and I had to get out of there.  Next time I'll try some take out since I really enjoyed the food.

I have been to this noodle cafe many times and love love their Ramen. Their TanTanMen is very good and very hot. I like their Shrimp Shumai too.  The sushi is OK but I don't go there for that.

I can't say enough good things about this shop. Frank really knows what people need and that's honesty and trust. He never has once tried to pull a fast one on me.  His costs are very low and the service is better than anyplace I've been to my whole life. Ever since I lost my father I've felt that everywhere I went with my car I was getting the wool pulled over my eyes....not here. You walk out of there feeling like you have a friend in the business and I'm not kidding.   I've recommend this shop to everyone who had complained they have something wrong with their car. 7 cars, including mine, that will only go to Precision.   I'll be a customer for life. Thanks Precision for restoring my trust in auto mechanics, my dad would have definitely approved of you all working on my cars.

Excellent place. They have some really neat bikes at a great price. Brought my bike in to have them put a new tube in and check the chain and it was done very quick and ran about 25 bucks.

.I ordered the pizza and 2 dozen wings for me and a friend.  The wings weren't cooked as I asked....they were very wet rather than extra crispy and they gave only two small plastic cups of ranch, you know the ones I'm taking about, can't even fit the tip of a wing in the cup. After 8 wings the ranch was gone.   As for the pizza...it is NOT fresh...I think it's actually a frozen pizza.  Was horrible and I couldn't even eat more than one slice...waste of my money.  The place is very dirty. The kitchen is falling apart, it makes me gag just looking at it. The dining area is filled with too much junk. It would be better if they take half the junk out of there and rid themselves of those old and unused arcade machines, broken toys and clocks and sun bleached decorations. Dusting is not a priority. If a big gust of wind comes in when someone opens the door you better cover your food.   I think the only reason this place is somewhat busy at times is because there really isn't any other place in the immediate area. I also think people go there because it USED to be good.

I brought my new puppy over to PetSmart to pick up some toys and clothes for him. The staff were very respectful and didn't touch my puppy without asking.  When I put the puppy on the floor to see how he looked in something I put on him one of the staff knelt down to look at him...all the sudden this yellow snake comes right at the puppy from under a display thing. I stood there thinking it was fake, it was a couple days before Halloween anyway. The guy jumped back about 5 feet and I grabbed the puppy. No one wanted to touch the snake and I got a giggle out of seeing them all run around trying to find something to scoop it up with.  The only reason I don't give this PetSmart 5 stars is, well, because it's PetSmart and they are over priced...unfortunately.

I actually like the pizza here. I have been searching high and low for good pizza near my new home downtown. I'm in love with Rays Pizza and when you're in love you want nothing else but what you love. Went in pretty late on Saturday night and the place was packed. We ordered the cheese bread and that was pretty good. Next up was the white pizza. Very good. I was surprised! The crust was very good, crisp yet soft and it actually had some taste to it. The wait staff was very nice too but they were very busy trying to calm down the drunk cowboy fan. Kudos to them for trying to keep that jerk under check. Anyway, I will definitely head back again. I hear they deliver too!

I was very happy with the veterinarian here I was just disappointed in the appointment I made. I called on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving so I could get a micro-chip put in my dogs. Well, they said come on in at around 5:15PM to get it done. I showed up only to be told that they didn't have any left and they haven't had any in a couple of days.  I was a bit upset since I had been striking out finding a new vet in my new neighborhood. However, I needed my puppies booster shots anyways. I waited longer than I wanted to but, oh well, this seems to be the norm at doctors offices be it human or pet. The vet tech and the vet were both super friendly and explained everything in complete detail to me. Very sympathetic and attentive to my needs. I think the tech had told the vet my rantings of the previous vet experience I had.   All in all, I am going to go back. The vet did assure me that I would be able to get the chip in both of my dogs without paying visit fees since I already paid them when I went the day they told me to. Thankfully!

This was the most horrible for I've had in YEARS! I'm pretty forgiving but I can't forgive the junk they cooked here. Please don't go, you will be horribly dissatisfied...I went at 12:30pm on a Friday.

I totally dig this place because it has some tasty broth for the Pho. I was super confused on how to order and the menu and all that but in the end I just ended up with a bowl of Pho, which was fine with me!  The broth was so good I really didn't have to add anything to it.   I went in at about 12:45PM. This seems like a place that a lot of people that work in the area go to. The staff was very friendly to everyone and I think that everyone else in there was a local.   Pretty good and is going on my list!   Oh and to find a Pho place that has a soda fountain machine is rare! Other places usually just give you a can of soda. Not this place. Fountain all the way!  I'd go back, for sure.

I've been going here for a couple years. I stuff myself silly. I recommend the orgasm roll. All their specialty rolls are very good and fresh. I wasn't too fond of the tofu appetizer. The miso soup is delicious. Bento lunch boxes have a lot of food too. I've heard that the chicken is dry but the beef isn't that bad, just a little dry.  They have a pretty good happy hour from 11 - 3 as well...they switch up what's on the happy hour menu every week or two which helps with the variety.

I stopped off at Fresh Wasabi for lunch today. I wasn't expecting too much when I walked in since it was empty and almost 12:30PM.    I sat down, ordered a water and 3 rolls from their lunch menu special. 11.95 for a Philly, spicy tuna and yellowfin rolls. I also got an order of Monkey Brains.  Let me tell you, the rice was so delicious! It was cooked perfect and applied perfect. The vegetables were crisp and the fish was super fresh. I appreciated the fact that the chef didn't overdo the amount of rice on the roll. Too much rice isn't good on a roll.  Anyway, that's all I had and I am definitely going back soon.

I love this place. It's been here FOREVER and I've just recently been introduced around Halloween. I went in to find some makeup and gags for both the Zombie walk and a friend gathering up in Jerome. What a blast! I wish I could rent a costume every day of the week and dress up as something different. Well, maybe I wouldn't go THAT far.  I specially love their huge selection of facial hair. Don't ask me why! I just do.  There are plenty of classic and new gag items too as well as super fun magic tricks and party favors.  I'm just blown away at how fun this little shop is.

This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food.   The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?  My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.  You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try.  As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.  Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff. It's not dirty, just broke down. You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya.   So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.  Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called "Salty Fish". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.  Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!

I have to say I went to this location because of their hours and for the Yelp reviews I read.  I had set an appointment and when I got there only one other person was out in the waiting area. I walked right to the counter and was asked to fill out some papers which was expected since it was my first time.  I finished the papers in less than 5 minutes and then I sat in the lobby for 30-35 minutes. Another woman walked in and told the lady at the counter she wanted to bring her dog in because he was acting strange. Her words "He was going up to a friend and wanting to be pet by him, he must be sick because he is shy" and then she got brought back with her pet!  I was already sitting there a good 15 minutes, REALLY?   I was getting a bit upset because, well, I don't have all the time in the world and just wanted to get my 2 dogs looked at. After 30 minutes I finally walked up to the counter and said "You do know I had an appointment at 11, right?"   Finally they brought me back to the examination room...I sat there for another 30 minutes! I couldn't believe it. My blood was boiling and I was to the point where I started to put my dogs back in the kennel to leave.  As I was packing them up  a tech came in to start off the temp and weight. She was very friendly and the reason why I gave more than one star. The tech did her thing and left...and there I was sitting waiting for the vet for another 10 minutes!  Here I am 70 minutes after my appointment and still have NOT seen the vet, I missed another appointment I had because of how long it took.  When setting up the appointment for the next visit I wasn't given an card or anything to remind me of when it is. I have no idea when the next appointment is, I may have missed it but that doesn't matter, I don't plan on returning.  I did get a call the next day about the stool but they weren't sure if the samples had been mixed up because the adult dog had parasites that a puppy would have and the puppy had some that the dog should have so they just generally treated them both.  When I went to pick up the medicine the person at the counter couldn't tell me what I needed to do to give 1 mil of the medicine to the puppy. Another tech happily assisted me and gave me a syringe, thankfully she was there.   When I asked the guy at the counter what kind of parasites I was battling the guy said "I don't know"... I asked if it was in their records and he said "No"...wait...what???? So I stood there thinking he was finding out for me...no, he was doing something else...I took the medicine and they didn't even say "Make sure when you're done you bring a sample back in to find out if they are better" It has been a week since the 7 day medicine ran out and I haven't got a call asking if all was OK and if I'm going to bring in the stool samples.  I really don't feel comfortable with this place, and I'm upset that it didn't work out....I had better hopes to find a vet in the neighborhood since I'm new to it.  Time to find a new one. If anyone has found something in the area that's you went to, please let me know by message.

Now this is what I am talking about!  I have been trying a lot of pizza places around this area. I just moved in to the neighborhood and have been missing my old areas pizza places. It's kinda sad the places I've found around here.  Then, I met Pinos....Pinos, will you marry me!  Wonderful pizza, delicious crust, great sauce! Oh my.  I cannot wait to order again! Mwah Mwah, to you, Pinos.

I've been here about four or five times. I am a big Pho fan and have been to many different places in the valley.   I'd have to say that Maximum has the friendliest staff working there. They are attentive, always checking that your water is full and give great suggestions on what seasonings to put in your Pho. The spring rolls are great too! Try them out. You'll have to roll yourself out the door after a couple of spring rolls and some Pho.   Try the #29 or #30, you won't regret it.  The last time I was here was after a night of heavy drinking! I crawled in about 10:30 am, thank gawd they are open that early, and the lady greeted us right at the door and immediately sat us and brought us hot tea. I think she knew we were hungover (or could smell the liquor from the night before emanating from our bodies). She recommended the chicken soup for a cure but I decided to go with the Mi instead because I'm a huge egg noodle fan. Mi is the same as Pho but with egg noodles instead.  Bottom line. This place is AWESOME and is my go to place for Pho and Mi.  Spring rolls are Delish!

I used to go to this location at least 3 times a week...then one day...the soup tasted like the smell of the bathroom...  I stopped going for a long time then a co-worker wanted to go there....ok, let's give it a try, I thought.  I'm not going to get this place into too much trouble saying what I really want to say...but the health inspectors need to visit...ick.  (it involves lots of bugs that can survive a nuclear explosion)  I can't believe this place has almost 5 stars. Crazy.

Their meats are fantastic! Not a big fan of the stuff they put on the sandwiches, it's called bug juice or something like that but you can skip it if you don't want it. The service is friendly too. I would go back more and more for sure.

I've been here a few times and think the bagels are very good but I'm not a huge fan of the coffee and their sandwiches.  I suggest you pick up some everything bagels. So good.   Employees are super friendly and recognize the regulars without issue.  Prices are great, you really can't beat 'em. You won't find another bagel place around here at these prices.

I will say what everyone else says because it's the truth.  The pizza is amazing, the staff is wonderful and the wait is worth it if you haven't been there before or have only been there one or two times.   However, the wait just becomes annoying after the 4th or 5th time coming here.  Kill some time and check out the secret drawer in bar bianco. You'll find it...bring a pen and a napkin and leave me a little note, I will write back ;)

I was looking to grab some tacos one night. I checked out Yelp and found that this place was in walking distance from my home and the reviews were great! Oh yeah, taco time!   For some reason I didn't check out the menu or attire before heading over there so I was a bit surprised when I walked in with my Vans on and a baseball cap.  Oops, my bad. Everyone was dressed in their nice evening wear and I looked like I was ready to hop on my bicycle and cruise around the block.  That being said, I was greeted and seated with a smile! I ordered a delicious margarita on the rocks and picked out one of the many tequilas on the shelf. Oh my! It's scary I live so close to a place that has my favorite drink.  The food, oh my, the FOOD! Class act.  When I said I was looking for tacos I wasn't expecting this place AT ALL. This is not your corner taco stand with sloppy beans and dry rice...this is gourmet Mexican food.   Even though I wanted tacos when the night started I had to splurge, because I was there. I ordered the The Pescado del Mar which included shrimp, lobster, halibut and scallops. Just a few of my favorite things. Being from New England I totally appreciated how the plate was cooked, if it wasn't cooked right you would hear it. The lobster and scallops were cooked perfectly and there was plenty of everything on there.  My friend ordered the Chile Relleno, she loved it.  Bottom line is this place is in an area you would expect to find some good cheap authentic tacos but what you get is some beautiful, delicious food and great ambiance. I would definitely recommend that you head on out to Barrio.

I have to say, I'm a bit addicted to the Jade Red Chicken with a side of Chicken Fried rice.  The flavor is excellent! You can taste a bit of everything before you order but I can say that the Jade Red Chicken is one of the best.  If you really want to burn up your face hole, go with "Jerk" anything!  The staff at Chino are very friendly and come to bring your food to you after you order it at the counter.  Just try this place out, you really won't regret it and you'll be back for more!  Oh and, hail to the snikerdoodle!

I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed.   They have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.  Try and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection. Make sure you walk around the garden when you're done.

I've been here more than a few times and appreciate most of the food here. It's very trendy. The staff is friendly and the seating is comfy.  I love the lettuce wraps to the point where I've almost been able to make them myself.  The phyllo pockets are good but lots of flavor so some might not like them.  If you like chicken, try the tan-tan chicken sandwich, with baba ganoush, green olives, spinach and some other nummy stuff.  The cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries are good for a sweet side dish.  The martinis are delicious and different. Try the banana split and the key lime pie martinis....heck, go ahead and see if you can try them all!

I live in central Phoenix and wanted some Dim Sum badly! I didn't want to drive up to my usual place since I was going the opposite direction, to Tempe. I looked up and found this place served Dim Sum. yay!    Me and a friend jumped in the car and headed down to China King. I sat down with excitement and rubbed my hands together as I opened the Dim Sum menu. I was then informed that Dim Sum ended at 3. Boo!  I pouted for a bit and didn't want to eat anything since I couldn't get Dim Sum but my friend convinced me to give it a try and I am SO GLAD she did. The dishes were fantastic, fresh and flavorful!  We ordered the Tofu #1 and some Chow Mein as well as an order of pot stickers. I would recommend just about anything from this place even without tasting it but those plates I had were fantastic.   Too bad it's so far away or I'd make myself a regular.

It's IKEA, what can I say. I love the stuff here. I just don't like walking around the earth to find what I am looking for. The place is huge and I'm just tired as heck by the time I'm done.  I think the prices on items are interesting. Some things that you think should be cheap are not and things that you think would be expensive are cheap! I don't get it.

Head out at happy hour and try all of their happy hour appetizers. I love the sesame seed ahi tuna.  Their hamburgers are delicious and so are the salads. I go up about once a week and pig out and have some big beers. I recommend this over any other restaurant in the area if you're looking for a romantic and tasty meal.

It was a dreary cold and rainy day....  Ok, well maybe not, this is Arizona.  I was absolutely starving at work and craving some GOOD Thai.  I headed over to Touch of Thai because the reviews were fantastic.  For an appetizer I tried the Crispy noodle. I've had it at other places and have liked it. You really cannot mess it up and Touch of Thai didn't. Don't expect a lot of meat on it though but the one or two pieces of shrimp and port were very good. I love the crispy noodle because it's sweet and reminds me of rice crispy treats. Add a little soy sauce to it and you got yourself a sweet and salty treat!  I also ordered the Red Curry with chicken for my entree. It was very good and filling. I tried the medium heat and I'm thankful I didn't go with hot because, ouch, it was hot enough at medium!  The chicken was great, wasn't dry and there was plenty of it. The carrots, green beans and bamboo shoots were fresh and crispy instead of all mushy like I've experienced at other places.  Very good.   The waiter was great! Very friendly and attentive. Wasn't hard to be attentive since I was in the door right as they opened for the day and was his only customer....bonus!   If you're around this area and want some good curry, head on over to Touch of Thai, for sure.

Saturday mornings are now my favorite. I've given up the hangover mornings to come to the open air market and shop the locals. Everything you need is right here. There are sweet potatoes the size of your head. Tomatoes the size of a small baby. Brussels Sprouts that look like tennis balls. Goat Cheese that melts in your mouth  Jams that will have your guests wondering where you found such a unique blend and plenty of local art.  So, get up, get going and get out to the open air market! You won't regret it.

Mmmm, Lenny, you make one tasty burger.  Seasoned well, delicious and quick. I've been going to another Lenny's in North Phoenix for about 15 years now and it's dangerous that this is in my new neighborhood. Pretty soon I'm going to look like a hamburger!

This market has a much larger selection than a lot of the markets in the valley. I love their selection of ramen soups. The veggies always seem very fresh. I mainly go here to grab some items for a quick ramen lunch though.  Be sure you bring cash if you don't plan on spending more than 10$ or you'll be walking out with stuff you don't need just so you can use your credit card.

Wow! This place is great for the area. It's been hard to find a Pho place in North Phoenix that I really like and I finally did it. I went with the Egg Noodle soup which some would argue isn't true Pho but I say boo to that!  The spring rolls were great as well. They weren't too sticky and had plenty of meat inside them. The service here was great as well, what nice people. The lunch crowd was huge but they still provided very quick service and were attentive on refilling my drink anytime it was empty. I have a feeling I will be a regular here real quick!

I wanted to hit up LoLos one day but somehow I ended up here.   There is something about this food that makes you want to roll yourself out of the building and take a nap for about 3 days.  I mean, smothered pork chops! Who does it better? The cornbread....oh the cornbread.... *smile* The portion sizes are generous without being overboard. You'll most likely finish your plate if you bring an appetite.   The ambiance is perfect for what's being served and the people running the joint are super friendly. If I ate here every day I'd for sure need a bypass within a year....that means yummy.

This is by far the best Mexican food on this side of the Valley and maybe even the whole valley. The food is delicious and fresh, the service is excellent and the prices are GREAT! I've brought real Mexicans to this place and they love it. Man vs Food didn't even need to come and plug this place, it's great either way.

I was way too lazy and not up for going out to eat the Monday after Christmas so I decided to go online and order some Mamma Mia based on the reviews here on Yelp.  I ordered the pizza, wings and soda special. The pizza was pepperoni with fresh basil on top and some hot wings with a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi. I also ordered 2 canolis. I completed my order at 6:15PM and was told, via email, that the food would be there at 6:55PM. Along comes 7:15PM and I'm wondering where the food is. 7:20 comes along and I hear a car. The delivery guy was sitting out in front of the house for about 5 minutes and I'm wondering....what the heck is up?  He comes up to the door and hands me a pizza with 2 bags of stuff on top. I see "hot Wings" written on one and just figured the other bag was the canolis.  I go inside for a second then thought...where is my soda? So I run out and tell the guy that I'm missing the Pepsi I ordered. He said he would come back after his other deliveries...ok, fair enough. I go inside and my friend had a salad out of one of the bags. I didn't order a salad! So I open the pizza and it's cold and just a plain pepperoni.  What the heck is going on???  So I called them and told them my whole order was incorrect with the exception of the wings.  About 5 minutes to 8 the delivery guy was there with my Soda, canolis and a tiramasu to make up for the lack of basil, which they said they were out of. Then he asked for the salad back because it was someone elses he had to deliver.   Pizza, cold. Wings...not so hot...Canolis, too much stuffing and way the stuffing was way too thick, like frosting.  Ah well, I had better hopes....Maybe they were busy? I won't chance ordering from here again to find out though. That was a 40 dollar loss...made me sad.

Here we go.... I'm always trying new Pho in the area. I actually order Mi but whatever, same thing but with egg noodles.  Anyway, I drove out here at lunch time and the place was pretty empty. There was some white guy sitting at the table next to me talking to his friend, a Vietnamese girl...I know this because he must have said Vietnam, your home town, teach me, blah blah blah...about 100 times as loud as possible. He also spoke as loudly as he could about being in marketing and her getting a job for some famous company in NYC...ugh, I wanted to leave.  Ok, that's not the fault of Pholicious so I will move on.  I ordered my usual Spring rolls and Mi.  I got the pork spring rolls and they were "ok" but the peanut sauce was so gross I thought I was going to toss cookies just looking at it. It didn't even taste like peanut and it was watery as heck.  On to the Pho (actually Mi).....it was surprisingly good. The BBQ pork was tasty, the wontons were good but the fish balls weren't that great. The broth was pretty good too.   I don't think I'll be heading down this way again though...there is better joints in the valley.

I absolutely love love love this place. It's one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley.  Everything I've eaten here is wonderful, cooked to perfection and with zest. I love the fact that they have REAL wasabi and not that horseradish paste that's dyed green. There are a bunch of things I would recommend but my favorite is the Wasabi Chicken. Oh wow, what a pleasure this is. Everything else is awesome too. I can't even think of one thing I didn't like. The alcohol menu is huge, the Saki list is grand and they taste wonderful. If you have questions about Saki just ask your waiter, they know their Sake.  The Ambiance is fun, I love to sit outside now that the patio is done.  Head on out...I can't even hear the name of this place without having a craving for it.

I live down the street from Tuck Shop and really enjoy riding my bike to go to dinner. This place is perfect for that. The food is delicious and the staff is SUPER friendly.   I've had a few of their plates and I'm not disappointed in anything I have tried there so, my suggestion, try whatever you like. They make an excellent dirty martini too.  I hope that they get some outside seating. I would love to sit outside and enjoy the weather while I can.  I am really hoping that they purchased the little house next door. I drive by the place every day and someone is in there working on it and I did see paperwork from the city about serving alcohol outside stuck on the door a few months back after the house was sold. *Squee!!* I will be one happy lady if that's the case!

The staff here was super friendly and the drinks were a reasonable price.   Met up with some friends there and had a little fun mid afternoon.  I can't complain.

I've been going to this place for years. I actually went on my first date with my current partner here. It's a bit nostalgic for me.  The happy hour is great! They make a TON of different rolls and they do them well and the fish is very fresh. The chef is excellent and friendly.  The Vegas roll is unlike any Vegas roll you've had before. Give it a try.  The Mexican roll....holy smokes! I swear they put a whole habanero into it. I thought I was going to die! Be careful with this one...  I've never had anything but the sushi in here so I cannot comment on anything else.  Give it a try and make sure you get a lot!  Oh, and try the lobster or scallop dynamite....it is DYNAMITE!!!

Very good Pho! It filled me up and was delicious. The bowl was huge and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The staff was kinda slow but that's ok. The pricing on most soups was under 6$. Ordered two soups and two sodas and my bill was 13 dollars! Can't beat that.

#26, #1, #150 is my favorite. I go here every time I need something warm in my belly. They are open early too!  I love this place and the dining area has gotten bigger :)  Had the Bun bo hue. Was pretty good and cheap!

I liked this location a couple of years ago but not anymore. Ordered the turkey and roast beef on wheat. It was dry and the beef tasted like bread. The banana peppers tasted like nothing as well. I don't think I'll be going here anymore....

I gave this place 5 stars because it had the best margarita on the block, delicious food, excellent staff and outdoor dog friendly seating and yes, that's my little Yorkie in the pictures.  Back to the Margarita.... I ordered the Lilikoi Margarita, yum! Was so good! I'm not big on the sweet drink thing so this was my choice. My friend ordered the "Dr. Funk" which was very good too but too sweet for me perfect for her.  For food, we had the pork pot stickers which were delicious. The sauces were both really good. Also had the Surfrider Chicken sticks which were nice and juicy and delicious as well.  We shared our entree and went with the Jerk Pork. Too spicy for my friend but was perfect for me. The plantain was perfectly sweet but I was kind of sad there was only 2 pieces which left me with only one piece since we split the dish. Plantains are cheap enough so not sure why they didn't give more. Plantains help break up the spicy jerk flavor, if they put more on the plate it would be perfect!   Finished off the meal with some macadamia nut ice cream. Very good! We chose not to go with the brownie and they had no problem with that.  Very friendly staff and they had no problem making things the way you want it.   All in all it's a great little place to sit around, drink your drinks and munch on some food.

I've been feeling under the weather and was in dire need of some comfort food. I have been seeing The Main Ingredient pop up on my Android Yelp app and decided now was the time. I got there about 8 and decided to sit outside, I didn't want to spread my germs around inside.  We ordered the Pro-Pasto and the Mac and Cheese.  The Pro-Pasto was good...not sure why I ordered it since I'm not really a huge fan of that type of stuff but it was good anyway.  Now to the greatest thing EVER!  The Mac and Cheese....it was to DIE for. This had to have been THE best Mac and Cheese I've had in my whole life and I'm not kidding. It was creamy, delicious and I couldn't get enough of it.  You MUST try it if you're there. It was so inexpensive too!  Another bonus is they allow dogs on the patio. Yay! Add this to another Dog Friendly place!  This is going to be my new hang out. Awesome mac and cheese, dog friendly AND down the street from my house. Winner Winner!

This park is pretty big and wraps through the neighborhoods. You'll find people playing Frisbee, walking their dogs and just plain old chilling.  Great lunchtime hangout.

Holy smokes! This place is FANTASTIC!  I was super starving this afternoon and was craving a good burger. I remember going to this joint about a year ago with some co-workers and decided to head on over again. The place seems to have grown since I was there a year ago. The counter seems to be back more than before but maybe I'm just going crazy.  Anyway, on to the experience! I was quickly helped at the counter by a very nice guy who took my order.  I ended up getting the Eddie Lopez Burger which had a SUPER tasty burger,  pastrami and is topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, swiss, and rocket dressing!  The only bad part was the part when it was all gone!  I also ordered the Onion Rings. I am not even a fan of onion rings but I had to give them a try since everyone suggested them. Wow! There was a pile of them and they were so good!  Next time I'm getting a double!  Forget going to any of those franchise burger places, hit this place up and be prepared to drool!

Teppinyaki, large servings, great meat and fish...just awesome! The chefs were fun, of course and had the kiddos laughing. The meat was so very tender and seasoned perfectly. We had a full party so the beverage service was a bit slow but expected.

This place is great for sporting events. The bar area is a little small because of the seating. The food is real good and happy hour food prices are great. I would have to say the onion rings are the best in the valley.

I will join in on the awesome comments this place gets. The food is very very good. The carne asada is delish! I couldn't get enough. I ordered 2 tacos for myself and a tostada. Both with Carne Asada. On the way out I had to grab a couple of their carne asada burritos for dinner.  Awesome!

I tried getting into this place a couple of times only to be denied by lack of parking and a packed house. However, I was finally able to get in and ordered a few of the spring rolls. The spicy spring roll with the fried pork was fantastic! So spicy I almost passed out. Now that's my kinda nummy.  I also ordered the veggie Pho but asked to add meat to it. I need my meat. It was a very good bowl of Pho...Pho sure. I will definitely go back.  Update: I rode my bike with a friend over to Rice Paper on Saturday and I had a blast! I sat outside with the owner and we all spent about 20 minutes chatting, drinking and having a good ole time.   We ordered a lot of food and spent a lot of money. We loved the calamari so much that we got 2 orders. We had a few drinks, sat out on the patio, which is new and has great plans ahead for it. The owner tells me that they will be putting in a fireplace outside and everything.  I am definitely going to be a regular at this joint. Great food, great staff and friendly owner!  As for parking. You can park next door and across the street. You can also park up against the building next to the establishment right in the driveway. Just make sure you leave room for others to get by and for more cars to park. I have a feeling this place is going to be the talk of the town.  The only negative thing I have to say is that I believe if you come in during happy hour you should get happy hour prices the whole time you're there. I've been to a lot of places that do this, some don't...I wish they all would though.

I had avoided this place for a bit because I didn't want to be standing there in line going "Uh...Ummm...Uhh..." and not be able to decide on what I wanted. When I finally decided to take the plunge I was pleasantly surprised to find it was very easy to order what I wanted.  My roll was the bomb.  Big tip? Cilantro is like bacon, it belongs on everything. Enough said. Try it out, it's rather yummy!
