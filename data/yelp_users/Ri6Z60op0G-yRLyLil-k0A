I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday. Food was good but service was terrible. My boyfriend let the server know it was my birthday, with no response from him, saying I just thought I would let you know. Our server responds by sarcastically saying, "yeah we have a fireworks show coming". No happy birthday, no thank you for spending it with us. Just walked away.   I followed up with the manager the next night. After explaining the situation to her, her response added insult to injury.  "I'll have a talk with him, but what do you want me to do about it?"    This is shocking customer service coming from a resort with multiple 4 diamond ratings.

By far the worst car wash I have ever had. For $20 you would think they would wipe down the inside a little. I'm convinced if you don't buy whatever up sell they're trying to get you to buy you're getting a crappy wash. I'm mad I tipped. Never will return to this location. Go to the one on frank lloyd wright they know what they're doing.

I've come here for years and is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant. I always try to come during happy hour because some of their prices are ridiculous. I'm not sure if they still send out their coupon in the mail if you live near by, but if they do use it and try them out if you haven't already.

Probably my favorite restaurant. Not over priced but still gives off the vibe of an upscale restaurant. The service is usually pretty good from my experience. The white chocolate brownie is so good definitely share it with someone.

I probably come here at least once a week. Everything on the menu is great and staff is always friendly. They have a really great lunch special, give them a try you won't be disappointed.

They have a great happy hour and best part is that it goes til 8. After that drinks are pretty pricey but still a good time either way.

This place is the best nail salon when it comes to nail art.  Lilly is extremely talented and I highly recommend her. I drive from the other side of town to this place. I also had a great pedicure that came with paraffin wax.

I love coming here to sit out on the patio it really is a gorgeous view. I love their grapefruit vojito! The only downside is it is packed and they don't have a happy hour. Get here early or make sure you have a reservation.

Tanned here before it was palm beach and will continue to tan here. They have the best beds that I have seen in any of the salons here, reasonable prices and all the girls who work here are friendly and helpful.

Love the patio here! Food is pretty good and their drinks are great! I always order the shhhh! It's also dog friendly so it's always fun to see the different pups people bring with them . It can get busy so if you're in a rush don't come here during their busy hours.

I had my first class yesterday with mikayla and loved it!! I will definitely be back for more.  The class pushed me further than any work out I could do in a gym. I'm definitely hooked on the Madison.

Do not go to this salon centric. The woman who works here is always such a nightmare to deal with. She will accuse you of not being licensed and make you stand there and call state board to verify. This is not only happened to me but a good friend of mine who is licensed as well. Go to the one on scottsdale and Shea the women there are always friendly and very knowledgable.

I have been looking for a new nail place since I moved to this part of town and after trying a few places I have finally found it! Kim did a wonderful job on my pedicure and was very friendly. I will definitely be back.

Best. Tacos. Ever. Their quesadilla is really good too.  They seem to close whenever they feel like, so make sure you call ahead.

Great service and amazing food.  Came here during their opening week and had a bad experience, but I'm glad we gave them a second chance. They really made my birthday special.
