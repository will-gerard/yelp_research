I will not be getting my sons hair cut at Cool Cuts for Kids again.   You see last November we had his first hair cut done there, and then we left town for a couple weeks, where we noticed that it was grossly uneven in the front (it was nearly an inch longer on one side of his forehead) We hadn't noticed because we nearly always do his hair in a style that had hidden the mistake.   when we returned home, I called the location that I had taken him to, only to be told that because it was over 1 week since the cut that I would have to PAY for another cut!!!   I was thoroughly disappointed at the lack of customer service! so sad, $17 for a child cut that is not even right is too much.

Went today with my toddler, had the lunch special (a 9inch cheese pizza) to share, it was ok, a bit reminiscent of a Totinos frozen pizza though.   Service was ok, though when my son threw up after a few bites of the pizza (and right as the server walked by) the server did not even offer more napkins. So that was disappointing.   Previous delivery experiences have been better. Which is the only reason they get 2 stars.

This is one of our go to Sunday morning breakfast stops. We hand always had great service and great food.   Though the wait is a bit extreme. Even closer to noon, it is still at the 45 min mark.   I really like the fish and chips.

this is a very small (3 two tops, and 2 three tops) breakfast spot. the food was good. the service was friendly. I just wish the menu had more egg-free options :)

We decided to check this place out this morning when I wanted to go out to breakfast. Turns out that there is a free breakfast option with the purchase of a drink (as others have mentioned here). This made our morning!   the free breakfast was good as were the biscuits and gravy, though the gravy was a bit thick for my taste, the quantity of sausage in it made up for the thick factor (I love sausage).   Overall, I would say give it a try. the prices were great and the staff friendly.

I was really looking forward to this place.... Won't be back. We ordered biscuits and gravy and chorizo and eggs with a side of turkey and bacon. It took 50 min for the food to come out and when it did everything was cold. The sparse sausage gravy  was lumpy and bland, and the biscuits were dry.   On the chorizo and eggs, my dining companion said they were 'okay' mind you that the waitress had said that the reason for the wait on the food was because they were making "fresh Chorizo'' we wondered if they meant they were mid slaughter being as it took so long to arrive. But then it was just OKAY? yeah, not good enough.   When the food came out the waitress dropped the side of turkey sausage, which ended up being a blessing because, though it took 10 more minutes to get a new order, at least it was hot.   We won't be going back.

Nicole McCord is a true artist and that it shows in her completely custom tattoo work! Everyone who sees my tattoo stops me to tell me how beautiful, amazing, and wonderful it is. Literally, I get stopped in the streets! She is also great to work with! you know how some artists are full of ego and self-absorption? NOT HER! She gets to the heart of what you want and captures it on your flesh! Perfection! her bedside manner is wonderful to boot, she is kind and caring. She loves her work and much as you will love her art!

Great food, and service. Atmosphere is fun, though small. It has some outdoor seating that will be great in the winter.
