I would like to rate the work here, but sadly I can't. The sign on the door states that they open at 9am. I had some time before work and thought I would get a quick mani pedi. I waited for 20 minutes and they never opened. As a small business I would expect they would want to be open during posted business hours to bring in new customers.   I won't give them a chance to waste my time again.

My mom and I went to this location for a morning smoothie. I remembered seeing a groupon available and I bought it waiting in line to order for 5 for $15. When I ordered the cashier rudely told us they don't participate in Groupon's and offered no apology. On the door is a whole letter explaining they aren't accepting Groupon's. They need a sign simply stating "Groupon's Not Accepted" because who is really going to read an entire letter while walking in? We spend over $17 for 3 smoothies. Plus the $15 for the Groupon. Of all the locations in the valley only 4 aren't accepting them. These locations should just be a part of the team and not give Jamaba Juice a bad name. The smoothies are just ok and the staff looks miserable in silly hats they are obviously forced to wear. I won't be coming back again. I'll take my business to a team player location even after my Groupon's are used up!!!

My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. The lunch prices are very affordable! I got the Panang Curry and he got the Pad Thai.   The lunch comes with a spring roll and cup of soup. The soup was ok but the spring roll was fresh and delicious. My Panang curry was amazing! I got it very mild and it still had a slight spice which is exactly how I like it. The Pad Thai seemed a little bland to me but my fiancé preferred it to others that he has had that had a little more sauce.   It is off the beaten path and tucked away in a complex but if you like Thai food I would recommend seeking it out and giving this place a try!

It's the day after my wedding and I have so much happening around me and my new husband... and the first thing I'm doing is writing this review RAVING about my flowers. Jen is a FLORAL GENIUS! I was blown away by how she captured the spirit of my wedding. I saw my bouquet at the church 5 minutes before walking down the isle and it brought me to tears! The reception was even more amazing! She listened to everything I wanted and delivered it an then some! I can't speak highly enough about her!

It's refreshing to see a unique concept on the west side of town. The owner hit the nail on the head describing the concept as a MODERN saloon. Western with clean edges and updated takes on classic dishes. Was also pleasantly surprised by their signature cocktails and draft beer selection. Will definitely be dinning here again.

The food is what you can expect from any Oreganos but the customer service here is not up to par. It's kinda sad because I went to college in Flagstaff and have set the standard of every location to meet the FLG one.
