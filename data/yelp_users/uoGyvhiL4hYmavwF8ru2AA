We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!

I was looking for someone to do ombre coloring on my hair.  I didn't have a good color stylist and with it being a newer trend I went to FB for suggestions.  Two of my friends suggested this salon.  One of my friends suggested Shaya.  She had used her before for color and really liked the results.  Upon arriving I immediately noticed and liked the decor of the salon.  Modern, but not overly pretentious. How about modern and tasteful, but still comfortable?   I loved the chandeliers hanging above the stations!  Anyway, Shaya came to greet me on time and took me back.  We discussed what I wanted and she busted out her ipad to look at images of what I had mentioned.  I felt comfortable knowing we both had the same image in mind.  Shaya was talkative without being over chatty.  We had recently had some drama so I probably ran at the mouth some (what is it about a salon chair?!), but the mood of the salon is very relaxed.  Everyone was super nice and I really liked the light processing section.  Its just one big long bench with overhead lamps.  They also provide ottomans and there is a TV on the wall.  Made my wait under the lamps super comfortable.  Time to wash!  I was surprised by the scalp massage I was given when washing out the color.  Really nice touch!   Another nice touch was that she actually blew out my hair instead of just blow-drying it.    I normally have to pay extra for a "style", but didn't with Shaya.  Maybe my last salon just sucked!  lol  Either way I am SUPER happy with the results.  I left looking and feeling fabulous!  I would totally recommend this salon and Shaya!

This place is awesome!  The cheesesteak is hands down the best in the Phx area.  Even the chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are amazing.  Hard to choose when you go, that's for sure!  Don't miss their fry sauce or the pizza fries.  MMMMMM!!!!  Oh and get some cookies.  Gooey deliciousness!

Seriously so gross.  I had read other positive reviews about this place so decided to try it.  Called for delivery and was told they were only delivering within a mile of the location due to lack of employees.  Ok, I'll pick up.  Ordered 3 dinner combos (2 sesame chicken and one sweet and sour chicken) and an order of chicken lo mein.  Arrived to pick up and stood in the front for a good 5 min before anyone even came into the dining area.  I should have taken the totally empty place as a sign.  Anyway, food was awful.  Egg drop soup and sweet and sour sauce were obviously cut with water and probably more than half.  Sesame chicken was mushy and tasteless.  Tried to add some hot mustard for flavor and even that was bad!  How do you have bad hot mustard?!  Will NEVER eat here again and wish I had my $35 back.  Oh and when I was there I asked for a menu and she said they were out of the paper to-go menus.  Really?!?

Seriously bad!  No flavor to the pizza at all.  Tasted like the sauce was made from ketchup.  Wings were OK at best and they forgot the ranch for our salad with delivery.  Would not recommend.  Spend your hard earned money elsewhere!

Great froyo! Their toppings are fresh and the toppings bar is always clean.  I am picky about "bars" being clean and the food not intermixing.  Their store, as a whole, is always clean and they have super friendly employees.  The indoor and outdoor seating is a plus and the whole front wall is a garage door so when its nice they open the whole place up!  Tad overpriced and wish I could find coupons more easily.  Other than that its top notch frozen delish!

Super good pizza and wings.  This place is now our "go to" for pizza delivery. I like that they have regular coupons and a VIP card to earn points for free stuff.   I prefer the boneless wings over the bone in, but just my preference.  Both are good and a must try with Joe's sauce!

My daughter and I stopped in for pedicures yesterday while waiting on my boyfriend and son to be done at the movies. HORRIBLE experience. First, this establishment is super in need of a facelift. It just looked grungy. Chairs in poor repair, etc. I was sat in a chair where the massage didn't even work. When I mentioned it she said, "Well do you want to move?" Yes, of course. Isn't the massage part of the cost of the pedi? She acted like it was a problem to move me to another chair. LIke she was miffed or something. Whatever. My daughter had shown a pic to her girl with the design she wanted. Pretty simple...big toe white with black chevron stripes and the rest of the toes hot pink. She is 13. They got started on her pedi. For whatever reason my daughter did not want the softening of her feet done...like the scrubbing, so asked her to stop. After confirming with my daughter I said, "That' okay, just do a toe paint for her." They, again, seemed super miffed. Well, sorry. I then hear my daughter say, "Oh, no that toe is white with black stripes." The lady literally YELLED at her saying, "WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME BEFORE I PAINTED IT PINK?!?!" Well sorry she wasn't staring at you the entire time. She had shown a pic of what she wanted and thought you understood the simple design. I said, "Whoa! Don't yell at her, she is a child!" Addressing my daughter asked what she wanted so I could intervene. We should have stood up and walked out then. The girl then was rough grabbing her foot, etc. Which I didn't know until my daughter told me after or we really would have had a problem. Anyway, so she gets done with the paint job on my daughter (pic attached) and it was really really bad. LIke my 10 year old son could have done a better job. My daughter came over to my chair with tears in her eyes. I asked her to show me her toes. I was like...no these need to be redone. Again, they acted like it was a huge deal or that we were a problem. Another girl did repaint her toes and they did look much better, but after my daughter had been yelled at and handled roughly. So, we go to pay. She says mine is $32 plus $5 for design. Totally fine. My daughter, who had stared to get a pedi, but then decided on just a nail paint was $20 then $5 for design. Um...what? Shouldn't we just be charged for a nail paint? They argued, no since they had trimmed her cuticles So I'm paying $25 for a cuticle trim and paint?! Well then she should have gotten the massage and everything else included with the full price of a pedi, which she did not get. I tired to explain this to them and, again, they got loud and tried to say it was our fault. They then offered me a $5 discount. Giving us her design "for free". Wow. Instead of $57 they charged me $52 then made a big deal about how they were fixing it. No, it didn't fix anything and we'll never be back. Please do not go to this shop and I wish I had read reviews before we chose to come.

I am so happy to finally have a decent Chinese delivery around us!  We got a flyer on our door so decided to try it last night.  The food is AMAZING!  We ordered (2) sesame chicken, pork fried rice and moo shu pork.  The portions are huge and the food is fantastic.  Delivery was super fast.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because I specifically asked for hot mustard and sweet and sour.  They sent 3 packs of hot sauce.  Well done, Tsing Tao, well done!

My carpets look amazing!  Let me tell you, we have 10 year old white carpet, 2 kids and 4 dogs.  We get our carpets cleaned about twice a year and have lots of different companies out to do the job.  Most of them are all the same and as long as my end result is ok and I have a coupon I am happy.  Miramar really raised that bar!  I had never used Miramar before, but found a coupon in the mail so decided to give them a try. It stated in their ad that not only did they pre-spray, but power scrubbed before steaming.  I haven't heard of any other company that includes this step so called to book an appt.  Spoke with Shawna and was able to get a morning appt a week before Thanksgiving.  She was very nice, explained what they would do and gave me a quote of $77. for 3 areas and a hall.  Genaro arrived on time and was equally professional and friendly.  Genaro and his assistant worked quickly, but were very thourough.  My carpets look brand new!! I really think the power scrubbing made all the difference.  The price when they left? $77. just like they said.  Will mos def use this company again and would refer!  Oh forgot to mention we had some splattered paint on the carpet by where we craft.  Genaro's assistant literally got on his knees and scrubbed until it was gone!  Gurantee any other company would have gone over it with the steamer and said "sorry that's not coming out".  Friendly, great prices and great service!

HORRIBLE!  We were so excited too!  We visited La Fonda tonight for dinner around 5:45pm.  There were 6 people in our party and we were told a 25 min wait.  I didn't think that was too bad.  We were offered a table in the bar, but had kids with us and didn't want to sit at a tall table.  The wait was about 25 min.  When we were shown to our table my Mom (who had on white capri pants)  barely bumped the chair next to her with her leg when sitting down and got a nice brown wood stain, stain on her pants.  Weird their wood stained chairs would rub off.  When we told the girls up front all they said/offered was,  "Oh, we are sorry!"  That's it.  To me not okay.  Now on to the food... My brother ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer.  We waited and waited.  Seriously about 25 more minutes.  Finally asked the server who was like, "Oh, let me go check".  He brought it right out which was about 2 seconds in front of our food.  So you think you can't mess up a cheese crisp, right?  Just cheese on a tortilla?  Well they managed to somehow.  The after taste was like burnt oven or oven type cleaner, maybe?  Awful.  I ordered the 3 item combo.  Fish taco, carne asada taco and cheese enchilada.  Fish taco was good.  Carne asada taco tasted like Pastor, which was kinda odd.  It wasn't bad just didn't taste like carne asada.  Cheese enchilada was terrible.  In fact you could tell that plate had been under a warmer for quite some time.  There was a layer of grease on top, which did not look appetizing. Instead of being covered in red sauce it has some type of red spicy chili sauce inside.  It did not taste good.  Even the beans and rice that came on the plate were bad!  The beans tasted like crushed up Ranch style beans and the rice had zero flavor and was so seriously clumpy the nicest thing I had to say was that it was easy to get the clumps onto the fork.  I am so disappointed this place isn't good!  We really wanted a new restaurant to visit in the area.  I am not overly picky about food...at all and please let me tell you to save your money or at least go get good Mexican food at Rosita's or Manuel's, that are in the same area.  We will not be back :(  OMGSH I almost forgot!  My son ordered the cheese crisp and beans off the kids menu and when they brought it out they had the bowl of beans sitting in the middle of his cheese crisp.  Who wants the bottom of a bowl in the middle of their food!?  Is that even health code okay?  I asked the server and he said, "Oh, that's the way we serve it".  GROSS GROSS GROSS!

Tried Babbo last night for date night and it was super!   The bread that comes before your meal is really delicious.  I ordered the chicken limone and added the asparagus ($2.50).  The pasta was cooked to perfection, wasn't too oily and I thought I got a good portion of asparagus that was added.  I, however, was totally out dinnered by my husband that ordered a make your own calzone.  This thing was massive and impressive!  He filled it with sausage, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  DELISH!  Just the right amount of cheese and their marinara sauce (that comes on the side for dipping) is outstanding.  We will be back and I will be ordering something with red sauce!   Service was good and it looked like they had an awesome happy hour menu. I wish I had room for dessert as that menu also looked good!  This place hits a home run for family's, date nights or just hanging out with friends.  Really laid back and chill atmosphere, but still sophisticated.  They also had a really nice patio area, complete with bubbling fountain, which I'm sure will be awesome after we are below 150 degrees!

We had held off on trying this restaurant mostly because of the lack of healthy options.  Not that I would expect them to be offered.  It is, after all, fair food.  After much begging from our kids and my hubby being in the mood for a corn dog (random!)  we decided to try it out.  I wish we hadn't have waited! When you walk in you are greeted and advised how it works.  Seating to the right you order at the counter and to the left (basically the bar) its full service.  We sat in a booth at the bar.  Waiter was fast, friendly and quick with refills on our drinks.  We ordered a variety of foods so we could try all kinds of goodies :  Turkey leg, brisket sandwich,  fried zucchini, onion rings, corn dog and funnel cake for dessert.  Fries also came with the sandwich and turkey leg.  Your food comes out on a tray that is covered in paper.  The food is just on the tray.  Not separated by person or on plates.  Obviously meant to be family style.  Fun and different!   Everything was amazingly delish!  The turkey leg was  tender and had a great taste.  The brisket was perfect (and I have to tell you we are super picky about our bbq), zucchini and onion rings were massive, but not overly breaded so still crispy and the funnel cake was warm yummy fried goodness.  The fries were the only thing I wasn't thrilled about.  They seemed super greasy and kind of soggy.  I didn't think the prices were bad.  We spent $60 (with tip) for 4, ordered a ton of stuff and couldn't even finish it all.  Seems like we spend about that anywhere else we go.  The decor is bright and fun.  They have lots of Ferris wheel seats around and pics of the AZ state fair.  Also, right in the middle of the restaurant is where they cook the turkey's and pig.  Kids thought it was neat to see them rotating on the spicket.  Next time we have a deep fried craving we will be back.  I really want to try the deep fried snickers and my hubby wants to try the fried bacon sticks.  Again,  not the healthiest of places to eat, but fun, delicious, and worth a try!
