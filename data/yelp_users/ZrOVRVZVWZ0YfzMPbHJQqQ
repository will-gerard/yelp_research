Wow!  Best Pho in Phoenix for sure. Broth is so intensely flavored I hardly had to or wanted to add anything to it. Also the best service we have had anywhere at any restaurant in ages. Super friendly and boxed our pho for us!  Also brought out cut chilled noodles for our baby. So impressed!

Amazing cocktail program!  You can tell they have been doing if for a long time, not just because it's now a trend. Food was awesome and very intensely seasoned. Cute ambiance. Really felt like I was out of Phoenix. The whole experience made me feel like I was in the Caribbean.

Seriously pour your own beer and wine on tap and pay by the ounce. So innovative!!!!  Great service and you can scan a barcode at your table and order from your phone. Bags (cornhole) on the patio. This is downtowns best kept secret for sure.

Like everyone has been saying this place has great potential and hopefully the owners get with it!  Beautiful decor and great friendly staff.  Unfortunaltey I have to give it only 2 stars because the food is extremely over priced and uninnventive.  $10 for a Caparese salad with just a few tomatoes and mozz......you can go to Vig across the street and get a Greek salad large enough to feed 2 people full of chicken and tons of veggies for the same price.  With all the competition coming to this neighborhood and all the great restuarants in the Central Corridor they're going to have a hard time staying open if they don't improve their pricing/menu options.

Best chips and salsa downtown!  Spicy!  Fish taco was huge and perfectly cooked. Great day drinking spot with inexpensive drink options and very reasonable food prices. Will be back soon
