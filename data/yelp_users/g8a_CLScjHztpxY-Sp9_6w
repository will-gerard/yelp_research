I love this place. The best ravioli in the city. The gnocchi is also amazing. They are really kid friendly. They prepare a wonderful chicken breast and vegetables for my son with allergies. The decor could use some sprucing up.

Too pricey for the food. The meal I had was just ok. My MIL had a terrible loud garlic pasta. It was stinky. They were also not too happy to see my two kids in tow.

This place is a special piece of living Phoenix history. Always make room for the creme brûlée trio. Great service. Excellent martini.

Today we went to Gelato Spot as a reward after a visit to the doctor. My two boys were so excited. When we got to the door at 10:30 we read the hours. They open at noon. My little boys faces just sunk, until the gorgeous young man sprinted to the door to save the day. He said he wasn't open, but would be happy to serve us. I was so grateful. Also my little one is allergic to dairy, so it's not like we can just go somewhere else to get ice cream. The strawberry gelato he had was lovely and the salted caramel I had was to die for. Thank you knight in shining Gelato for saving the day. You really made a difference.

Kathy and all of the teachers at this school are amazing. My kids have been through all of the different sessions and loved them. The teachers have passion for music and are great with little ones. This is one of my favorite small businesses in the 32 Shea area.

My guilty pleasure. Yummy and the price is right. Warning, the dinning room is very crowded. I usually take food to go.

We always enjoy the fresh fish. The family that owns Wild Tuna makes you feel welcome and cared for. Tonight I had some of the best yellow tail. Great for families or date night.

Old Fashioned. This is awesome. A piece of Wisconsin in Phoenix at a health food restaurant. I was shocked. The old fashioned was wonderful. So good I had two. Let's say I am comfortable. I hope the nutritious food will counteract the whiskey.

I loved my manicure and pedicure. It was very relaxing, clean, safe, and no icky fake nail dust and chemical filled foot tubs. I had a similar manicure and pedicure at The Hotel Valley Ho Spa. My mani pedi at Pure Nails was just as nice without the crazy Spa price. My heels are so soft now and my polish on my hands lasted longer than a week, my toes are going on two weeks and I have been in the pool and hot tub. I would have given this place a five, but the location in a beauty mall and the fact that it took a while for someone to get back to me when I left a message to make an appointment.

My family has been coming to this salon for over four years. We love the owners, who have been so accommodating when it comes to our schedule with two small kids. We really like Deanna and Manuel. The prices are also very reasonable for an Aveda Salon. It is also nice that Aveda has reduced the chemicals in their products. The salon is very clean and doesn't smell like perm. Also the ventaltion is quite good. The stylist continue to get education and are very meticulous. They do not rush and always get every hair in place. Nothing worse than getting home with a few hairs here and there that did not get cut. Last, but not least I love Michelle. Her manicures and pedicures are lovely. Plus I enjoy our lively traditonal salon conversations.

Amazing. I loved every bite. The food is amazing, delicious, beautiful. The building is prefectly restored and a real treasure. I will go back again. Tip- Sundays are great because Bianco's is closed, so parking is much easier.

Nancy's massages are so therapeutic. Everytime I leave Her office I feel so relaxed and rejuvenated.  She is so knowledgable and I trust her with my mom. My mom has had shoulder surgery and other health issues. Nancy cares and she is experienced.

We had a terrible experience at this lunch buffet. The table was not very clean with food in the crevices. The owner assured us that there was plenty of safe food for my son that is allergic to egg and dairy. The tomato soup tasted canned. The vegetarian korma had frozen vegetables. The lentils had kidney beans mixed in which I have never seen at an Indian restaurant before. It all ended with my son puking on the floor. So much for a dairy free meal. Not sure how this place got a four.

If I could give this place a zero, I would. We had top shelf margaritas. Basically good tequila with very bad store mix and a little guest fruit fly. Atmosphere and service was about the same.
