It was the first time I'd ever been to a HRC and it was incredible. Went in with my daughter about noon on a Tuesday, restaurant was empty  and Cody was our server. He was very attentive and personable, I've honestly never had better service. My daughter and I shared the bruschetta, Mac and cheese (without the roasted red peppers) and the hot fudge sundae. Overall I have no complaints, it was a fantastic experience.

I haven't been to a Cocos in a few years, and I remember why now.  I took my daughter there on a Saturday, mid morning. It wasn't very busy but there were tons of people in the waiting area. After 15 minutes of waiting for a hostess, I put my own name down on the wait sheet and took a seat. As more guests came in, still no hostess. It took 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge that there were people wanting to dine in their restaurant. After the hostess finally came up, she informed us that in addition to us already waiting 25 minutes, it would be an additional 10 minute wait. After being seated, the server was great, the food not so much. You could go to IHOP and get better food and faster service. Needless to say I won't be going there again.

DO NOT COME HERE!  We came here Saturday night with pink eye, 8:30 pm EMPTY waiting room, waited an hour, asked the receptionist how much longer the wait was, said she didn't know. I asked how many physicians were on duty this evening and she replied "one, we always only have one." ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME?  So I quickly googled the wait time at Phoenix Childrens Urgent care down the street and it was a 15 minute wait. I told the other parents in the waiting room the situation and MAGICALLY a room opened up that second for us and the Dr. saw us right away and got a script within 7 minutes. The icing on the cake was that this is a new location and it was absolutely filthy. The floors needed a disinfecting mopping in the worst way and it was really dingy. Avoid this place at all costs.

Decided to stop by on Christmas Day about 5 pm because there was an hour wait at SanTan Brewery . We wanted to get some quick appetizers and hang out till our table was ready at the other restaurant. It was about 10 minutes until a frail looking blonde waitress (who looked like she needed something to eat and to maybe lay off whatever prescription drugs she was taking) came up and asked us if we were ready to order.... We hadn't even received menus yet, but asked for water while we looked them over. Another 7-10 minutes go by and she comes back, still hasn't dropped off our drinks and asked us if we were ready, we ordered 2 appetizers, she didn't write it down and left. My boyfriend ordered an epicenter and 55 minutes later we still have no appetizers and empty water cups.   Side note: I can't put all the blame on the waitress, but whoever made the schedule for that day should be fired. There was 1 server, the bartender and what seemed to be the manager on duty. So 3 people running FOH on Christmas Day....  Just terrible planning.   Btw-we never saw the blonde again. We watched as she was giving the wrong food/drinks to the wrong tables and walking around with a confused look on her face.  We waved down (who we thought was) the manager on duty, a very nice brunette who seemed to be running the entire place, and asked the status of our order. She informed us that the blonde had never even rang it in and she'd get it to us ASAP, which she did and apologized profusely and took care of our meal for us.  We felt bad and wanted to leave her something but when we went to get money out of their ATM, it was out of service.   All in all, it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant . Hopefully upper management will plan better for next year.

We usually go with my older daughter, but now that my little one is big enough to bounce (14 months) we brought her too. It was a Friday, 10am and we were the first ones on the "7 and under area". I had a 2 year old and my 14 month old with me. They are both the same size, tiny. So I went on the trampoline to show them how to bounce since they had never done it before. I was instantly informed that I couldn't be on there with the kids for their safety. Really? They are 1 and 2. So I asked where we could go so that we could play -together and was told that there is no place we could. My only option was to sit there and watch them. Well, 1 and 2 year olds don't just "go off and play". So it wasn't a fun experience. I couldn't even sit on the trampolines with them. I suggest Jumpstreet invests in a toddler zone where parents can play as well. Not to mention there was a ladder just leaning against a corner where a little kid could have easily knocked it over and hurt themselves. The place is dirty and chairs/arcade is run down. The place is run by a bunch of rude teenagers who won't leave you alone. This isn't the first time I've had a negative experience with the "staff" . We probably won't be back

In love with this place! This restaurant has been about 80 different things before they bought it and so happy they did! Finally, something to do in downtown Gilbert . Service is always fantastic and of course the food, drink, and atmosphere are fabulous. I've been about 10 times and it's never a bad experience.

Just incredible. I can't speak highly enough of this place. I've been to a few reflexology places around the valley but this one takes the cake every time. Either my boyfriend or myself fall asleep each time we go (always the 60 min option).  This is coming from someone who was a Massage Envy member for years, it's hypnotizing.  Not only that but the price is unbeatable. For 1 hour it's only $30.

This was our first time dining here, we were initially going to go to the Phoenician for Easter brunch but family invited us to dine at Wicked 6, and we accepted. They told us that last years Easter brunch was phenomenal, as was thanksgiving, but we were less than impressed. The chicken was dry, salmon was dry the vegetables were undercooked and the prime rib was just really sad. Service was so-so. It was a very underwhelming experience and was absolutely NOT worth the $130 we paid for 2 people. The folks who invited us were disappointed as well, stating that last years was so awesome but this years was such a disappointment. We most likely won't be back. Not to mention they automatically tacked on a 20% gratuity-which was not deserved. Our waitress was nice, but not nearly as attentive as we would have liked.

Went to the queen creek location years ago and it's still just as good, SO happy  there's finally one in Gilbert! There are so many choices so I asked one of the guys to surprise me, and I got a baby sized (which is more than enough) red raspberry/hurricane with cream. AMAZING!

Really wasn't anything special, my salad and dressing was very bland. It's not hard to make good food, which shows lack of effort. We won't be back. A disappointment for downtown Gilbert -this is coming from a Gilbert native.

Stopped in here for the first time on my way to the idea museum across the street. The guys were very welcoming and warm. I was offered a peppermint mocha (which I LOVE) but was feeling like a chai this morning.  The owner (I think) even made it dirty for me at no charge! I usually frequent Dutch Brothers, but this stuff is good...really good. I'll most definitely be stoping by on my weekly trips to the museum with the kids for my caffeine fix. Highly recommend!

It was our first time here, for brunch on Sunday morning. The ambiance reminded me of having breakfast on the island of Hydra,Greece. The clean feel of the blues and whites and very modern yet cozy feel made for a pleasant dining experience. So much attention to detail went in to the setup l, from the perfectly placed stemware to the little sprigs of rosemary tucked into the linens. I brought along my 2 girls, ages 6 and 1. While I wouldn't say it's good for kids, (more for romantic/relaxing date nights) they had everything we needed: high chair, kids cups, etc. I ordered the steak and eggs, overeasy/med rare and my girls shared the Nutella crepes . Disclaimer: I am complete and total food snob, so when I say something is good, it's pretty friggin phenomenal. My steak and eggs were perfectly seasoned and cooked, I'm salivating now still thinking about it. And the fries underneath it all, soaking up the juices were so savory yet still crispy. A beautiful fruit bowl accompanied it, and not the lame fruit usually served as a side, it consisted of strawberries, blueberries, Granny Smith apples and Pears. Our server was Kealyanna and she was attentive and gracious. She even offered a linen to put under my purse so it wouldn't get dirty.  I will definitely be back to try the dinner service with the Mr. Thank you for such a great experience!
