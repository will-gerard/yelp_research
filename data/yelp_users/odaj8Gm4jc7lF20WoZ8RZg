Nice place to try a different kinda of sandwich if you're tired of chains like Subway. I love their Housemade Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil : food was fresh and the bread was excellent. I also tried the Tuna with Red Onion, Gaeta Olives, Lemon & Arugula and that was nice as well.  Service/seating was really quick (went on a Saturday for lunch). Only complaint is the parking, had to park on the street a couple blocks down because their lot was packed.

I've been going here since high school and this is my favorite tennis club in AZ.  The pros here are top notch. Greg Prudhomme is a fantastic teacher; he is always positive and he knows his stuff. Brian is also a great coach: he makes things very easy and I always find his tips very helpful.  The part I like is they have programs that can fit my schedule and are reasonably priced. Attendance is flexible for adult clinics and we learn about two new things every time.  Courts are well maintained and lighting is good (which is something I can't say about some other tennis clubs in AZ).

This poor review is strictly regarding my experience with the tennis courts. I played a tennis match here and found out from my opponent that almost ALL the courts have dead spots where the ball dies.  I would not recommend playing tennis matches here unless they fix the dead spots.

I've had poor experiences with the front desk workers. My first time going here I tried to make a court reservation two days in advance and the lady who answered the phone condescendingly told me they only take reservations 24hrs in advance and she wouldn't even tell me what courts were available.  Another time I tried asking another worker at the front desk to explain to me what type of programs the place offered and he just brushed me off and pointed to some pamphlets. Not helpful at all.  The courts/lighting are adequate but i'd rather go to other tennis centers that have better customer service.

My favorite sports bar in Phoenix. The food is a slight step up from regular sports bar food: they have a great variety of Italian food. The price is slightly pricey (more than $10 for a pasta dinner), but the portion sizes are big so you get your money's worth. I've tried the baked ziti and there was a good balance of sauce and cheese. The 10'' personal pizza is perfect for a single person: if you're a big eater it should fill you up. I usually get the Santisi Combo w/ pepperoni, sausage and peppers. I also went here a couple of days ago and ordered a cheese calzone, which was very big and could be shared with another person. Their garlic knots are also a must have with every meal: they're not too soggy like the pizza chains and go great with marana sauce.  The ideal place to sit is on the main part of the restaurant with all the televisions (opposite of the game room with the pool tables). I've been here during NFL conference championship weekend and during March Madness and they do a good job showcasing the games people want to see. On a typical Sunday for football, you'll see the big games on the bigger screens and other sports like golf/tennis/soccer on others. They'll even show niche sports like MMA so that is a big plus for me.

Ordered two pizzas for our office: one full pizza with sausage, peppers, onions, pepperoni and olives and the other was a medium veggie pizza.  The food not that great; it tasted like the pizza had been sitting in the car for a while. The sauce tasted bland and the crust was not crispy at all.  I felt like the pizza was frozen and re-heated up again. Also, it seemed like the vegetables were overcooked.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.

Went here on a Friday night for my 23rd birthday with my family. Don't let the outside fool you, its very nice inside.  Service was top notch. Waiters were quick with the refills and we didn't have to wait too long for our food.  I ordered the Top Sirloin steak and it was delicious. I recommend the garlic mashed potatoes, very tasty. I also got a complementary dessert for my birthday: I LOVED the Fruit Crisp a la mode. My parents shared the ribeye and they loved it as well.  Overall I'd definitely go here again.

Went to this show a couple of years ago with my parents. Great show to take your kids, but not so great for older people. The novelty of 3 guys in blue suits pounding on drums got stale really quick. Also, their audience participation bits were pretty lame/cheesy (ex: putting a spotlight on people coming late).  Would not see this show again.

(Keep in mind there are few choices for Hawaiian style fast food in AZ so this might influence my review).  I love going here when I have a craving for Hawaiian food. I usually order the BBQ mix plater composed of beef, chicken and short ribs. I also love their macaroni salad. The portions here are quite large; I usally eat half the plate and save the rest for later.  The people at this location are very friendly and the food is prepared quickly. I would recommend this place if you are tired of eating at the burger/Mexican chains around Phoenix.

I like Bookmans over Barnes and Noble because there is a large selection of lightly used books/DVDs/video games selling for half price. Also they're a great place to buy magazines for those airplane rides/road trips. Bookmans usually has the issues for the current year, so if you don't mind having someone else's address on your magazine this place is for you.  You can also trade in your books/CDs/DVDs for store credit. I don't recommend selling your stuff for cash because the offer they give is VERY low.

Saw Russell Peters on May 30. The venue was nice: I sat in the back of the ground floor and still had a pretty decent view of the stage. There really isn't a bad place to sit.

Went here at 1am on Black Friday. The place is pretty ghetto for being inside a casino.  Oxtail Soup was the only thing worth trying. Ordered the fish and chips and it was still cold on the inside. Also tried the steak and it was pretty bland. One trick pony in my opinion.

Went here because the UofA Phoenix alumni held a viewing party for Wildcats baseball game.  I agree with the other reviews: they are understaffed. They had 3 waitresses for about 40+ people. I was disappointed because they took 50 minutes from taking our drink orders to our food orders. Even after writing down what we wanted the waitress still forgot what beers my friends' got and we had to check up with the girl after 15 minutes and had to repeat their drink orders. Service got better at the end of the night (made sure our food was ok, refilled our drinks, and split the checks without complaining), but the beginning of the night left a bad taste in my mouth.  Food was made quickly but it was nothing to brag about: our whole table ordered burgers and they are all just slight variations of one another. Even the salsa/chips appetizer was mediocre: most of the chips were crushed up and the salsa seems store-bought (other sports bars I've been to have made their own salsa, so call me a snob I guess).  One bright side was that there was an open bar for 30 minutes after the Cats won. But overall, a less than pleasant experience.

I've been to Jason's deli twice and its become one of my favorite places to eat for lunch. My personal favorite is the Sante Fe Chicken sandwich; I love the guacamole mixed with the bacon and chicken breast. I also like how they have complimentary soft serve ice cream as well.

From the outside I thought it was a sit down restaurant, when actually it was a fast food type joint.  I've tried the pulled pork and the chicken sandwhich. Quite subpar: very chewy and not fresh at all. When I recieved my pulled pork sandwhich I noticed that the meat was scooped on the bread, cafeteria style...YUCK.  There are better BBQ places out there.

My favorite place to eat when I'm tired of the food courts on the strip. I've only tried the club sandwich (which is excellent BTW), but I hope to try the other ones next time i'm in Vegas. The bread is toasted perfectly and there is a nice variety of hot sandwiches.

I first tried this place when I was studying at the UofA and I'm glad they have a location here in Scottsdale.  Personally, I prefer deep dish Chicago-style pizza but Sauce has helped me gain more of an appreciation for thin crust as well. I've had both the portobello/artichoke and the sausage/pepperoni pizza and both are quite tasty.

The interior is clean and decorated well. Went here for the lunch buffett; for $11.95, you get a good selection of food: chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, samosas, chicken tandoori, aloo gobhi, and some others I missed. All of them tasted good for a buffett, and they made a conscious effort to refill the food quickly. I also got garlic naan with my order and I highly recommend it: it was very crispy and didn't have too much garlic on it. For desert I had the gulab jamun with rice pudding, which was also very good. My only complaint was the rice: it was kinda hard and thin. I'm not sure if they intend to cook it this way, but I prefer my rice kinda sticky.   Service was pretty good as well. They took away the buffett plates in a timely manner and refills were prompt. I got tired of going to the chain restaurants, so if you're in Scottsdale I would recommend this place for a nice change of pace.

Had the beef sausage with hot peppers with small fries which cost about $9.  Although the portion size was big, I hated how soggy the kaiser roll was. Also, I noticed the hot dog was burnt on both ends which killed hot dog for me. Fries were fresh, but nothing special.

Great choice if you want something sweet on Mill Avenue. I ordered a whole macademia white chocolate chip sandwhich with German chocolate cake ice cream inside. Definitely bigger than I thought it would be. The cookie was softer than I thought it would be and it was quite messy.  If you are eating here for the first time, I would recommend ordering the half cookie sandwich; the whole thing might be too much sugar for you.

I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.  I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.  I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.  I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon.

Great place for a morning pick me up: all their drinks can be ordered in hot and cold options. My usual orders are the Caramelizer or the Cocomo. The one thing I really like about this place is that their coffee isn't too hot and tastes really sweet  (obviously, this might be a turn off to some coffee snobs).  I usually stop by this place around 8am and the drive through gets really busy - but the great part is that there is a runner that takes people's orders beforehand so you don't have to wait too long. Staff is almost always very friendly in the morning which is a big plus for me.  If you really like this place, definitely get a punch card and order on Two Punch Tuesdays.

I've been here on two occasions and service has been pretty nice. I've tried the breakfast sandwich and the french toast and the food is definitely better than the standard Ihop/Denny's chain breakfasts. Portion sizes are bigger than usual. Staff is very friendly.

Ate the seafood alfredo and was VERY disappointed. The sauce was very watery and bland. I basically loaded up on soup and breadsticks. Definitely a pass.

Met Dianne at the Yelp Elite event at PBS studios. She had a table set up to paint people's faces at the event. I was really pleased with her work (she painted Cookie Monster on my face - see the photos). She really took her time to paint people's faces and she was very nice. I will definitely recommend her to my friends who throw kids birthday parties. Keep up the great work Dianne!

Had lunch with my boss at this place last week. Very nice on the inside, surprised to find out this place was a chain.  Had the tomato bisque and split the bruschetta sampler. Both plates were excellent. Everything was freshly made (our waiter reiterated this fact several times). My favorite bruschetta had the caramelized onions on it. Also, I loved the mini deserts. Great way to have something sweet without paying/eating too much. I ordered the Bread Pudding and it was AMAZING. I

Went here for the UofA victory over ASU at the 2011 Territorial Cup. Setup is fantastic, television everywhere: they do a great job of showing all the relevant football games.  Ordered the Rocky Point burger with Sweet Potato Tots and I really enjoyed it. Portion size was very large: the burger was very big and they give you a lot of tater tots so you definitely get your money's worth. Also, ordered the Nachos and had to share it with my table: very good as well. Waitress was very nice and was very quick when splitting our checks.  Only reason why this place doesn't get a perfect rating is the poor parking situation. My group and I had to park at the Safeway across the street. I would definitely go here again in the future.

Nothing really to rave about. Hot dogs are really big, which should be expected with its price tag. Seating is pretty limited, which sucks when its crowded or hot.   If you are trying this place for the first time, don't wait in the long lines. I definitely don't think this place is worth the wait.

Hands down, the worst Filipino buffet I've ever been to. I really didn't like the food selection (not varied enough, too bland) and the restaurant could be a little cleaner.  My major gripe was when I found a long piece of hair in my fish. I pointed it out to the wait staff and the lady just took away my plate without offering any apology. On top of it, I was still charged full price for the buffet. I realize that restaurants have different policies when handling these types of situations, but the least the staff could have done was acknowledge my complaint instead of sweeping it under the rug. I will never go here again.

My go to place for Asian food for when I'm at work. Their lunch combinations are the best bet for people who want a lot of food at a decent price. You order an entree and each combo comes with egg soup, green salad, an egg roll, and your choice of rice (Jasmine, Brown, or Fried) for around 9 dollars (a lot more variety than the entrees at Pei Wei).  My favorite dishes to order for lunch are the Pad Thai with Chicken or the Mixed Vegtables with tofu. Unlike other Asian restaturants, I feel they don't cheat you with the food (skimping on the meat or tofu). I usually order carry out and they're realitively quick (only 10-15 minutes wait). I've also dined-in during lunch (their busiest hours), and they do a great job of getting customers in and out without sacrificing their quality of food.

I used to be an In-N-Out fan but Five Guys is now my new favorite new fast food burger joint.  I think Five Guys gives you a good value for its price. The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings (from mushrooms to peppers) to add on your burger. Also, their fries are pretty good, though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones.  Be sure to tell them you want a "little" hamburger or cheeseburger or they will give you a double patty burger.

I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings before, but my first visit at this location was during UFC 117.  If you come here to watch fighting events like UFC I would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside. I arrived an hour before the PPV portion of the fight started and didn't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside. I ordered 12 regular wings and I was very underwhelmed. I felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average.  The main reason why I went here was that they weren't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight. Also, the atmosphere for a UFC fight was really good compared to the other BWW I went to in Tucson.  If you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event, you should come to BWW. But your food expectations should be lowered a lot.

My favorite BBQ spot in AZ. I usually get the beef brisket with macaroni and cheese and waffle fries. The meat is cooked really well: it is almost always tender and juicy. They also have good variety of BBQ sauces, from standard to sweet then spicy.  If you're really hungry you can get the sampler plate for around $11 though, that could feed two people in my opinion.  Don't let the outside fool you, this place is great and there is plenty of room for overflow in the back.

Like this place better than Golden Spoon. I sampled Cappuccino and Caramel; very good together. I ended up getting raspberry and cheesecake which was also good. The choices are standard (i.e. strawberry, raspberry, vanilla)  I really like how they have a good selection for mix ins: from cookies to candy to mochi.  Also, the setup inside is really nice: lots of booths and tables outside. My only minor complaint is their cups are one size only and they're pretty big.   Staff was very friendly and that bumped it up from 3 stars to 4.

To attend a show you have to make an online/phone reservation beforehand for the specific time/date you want. The weird part is they don't actually send you a confirmation e-mail or phone call, you kinda assume you have seats (unless the website/calendar indicates the show is sold out, then you aren't able to make reservations). Our tickets cost about $15, which is reasonable compared to other comedy shows.  Once you arrive at the venue they give you a sticky note with a number on it and then you wait in the lobby with the rest of the people before the show starts. 20 minutes before the show starts they call people in groups according to the number you assigned and they check you off a list of people who've made reservations.  The venue is smaller than the Tempe Improv (only 1 floor), but I like it because it gives a more intimate feel with the crowd (there def. isn't a bad seat in the house). There is a 2 item minimum per person and the menu is filled with your standard bar food (fries, burgers, etc.) for less than $10. Food isn't great, but I don't expect fine dining at a comedy club.  I saw Jen Kirkman/4 other local comedians perform and it was a good time for the most part. Performing in a small venue allows some nice audience interaction. My only major gripe was the poor experience I had with our waitress. She totally forgot to pick up our credit cards at the end of the night and we ended up waiting 20 minutes after the headliner finished for us to leave (unlike the Tempe Improv, where the waitresses took care of the bills before the headliner finished). I'd definitely go here again, but I'd hope we get better service next time.

Comparing this event to the Spartan Race, the Warrior Dash is better race for people who aren't competitive runners. It's only 5K and the obstacles aren't that hard to complete. Parking was smooth going in and out and check in (for your wallet, car keys, etc.) was quick/safe.   If this is your first time doing this type of run here are a couple of tips: *Wear a pair of shoes you don't mind not using again - during the race the mud portion basically ruins your shoes so just donate them to the pile they have stacked up at the end of the race (they all go to charity) *Bring a spare outfit to change in afterwards - you can leave it with the check in *Also bring extra towels to dry off/protect your car *Try to run really early in the day or late afternoon- that way you aren't running in 100 degree weather  My only complaint is the showing system after the race: they just have one large hose that sprays groups of people. The one thing I really liked about the Spartan Race was they had a shower area with a bunch of hoses where you could wash yourself off. Much more efficient IMO.

Alright place to go if you want to try some slightly overpriced chicken strips. I ordered the standard box combo and the food was made quickly. (You definitely get your money's worth on the portion-size).  The chicken itself is nothing spectacular, I like the strips at Chick-fil-A a lot better. The sauce is unique and I'd definitely try it , though the sample they gave me was a bit watery.

My PS3 had trouble reading games: came in on a Friday and had to keep it overnight for diagnosis. Told me up front the repair was going to cost either $110 to fix the blu ray or approximately $150 to completely replace the blu ray. Got a call the next day and was told it was ready for pick up. I was told they had to replace the blu ray and my ps3 worked like they said. The console definitely works after a month and they also have  a 30 day warranty in case it breaks down again.  I would definitely recommend them for game console repairs: very professional and good customer service.

Not a country fan at all but my friend convinced me to go along  because Georgia Chrome (a country cover band) plays songs on Thursday night. Arrived around 930 and I was glad there wasn't a cover (at the time). Not sure if they charge a cover afterwards.  Area is very nice, very clean and tv screens everywhere. Staff was very friendly and I was able to seat myself and 2 other friends comfortably. Ordered the grilled cheese with fries as a side (you can substitute any side for the soup). I was very impressed with the sandwich - it had 3 types of cheese combined with jam and it tasted awesome. Fries were better than the standard bar food. I also tried my friend's tomtato/pesto mozzarella sandwich - I recommend that as well.  The band plays on top of the bar on a stage and they sound really good. Didn't recognize any of their songs but they did play some cover some mainstream songs like "Don't Stop Believin'" so I was able to sing along to that I guess. Had a great time and I'd definitely come back again.
