Enjoyed the rueben sandwich again today at lunch. The frequent customer punch card is a pretty decent deal too.

Disappointed at the tiny automotive section here, but appreciate that the checkout lines are typically reasonable and cashiers usually friendly.

Frustrated again at the very long lines to check out. If they would just open the self checkout terminals and/or add another cashier, it would increase satisfaction and stop driving customers away who get tired of the long lines at nearly every visit.

All you can eat chili, tastes great -see the promo info posted on the door for details of days after 4pm. Inside staff was friendly and said the onions were freshly added but still offered more fresh onions and cheese on top. A d of course the Frosty is always delicious. This good experience mad up for my disappointing previous visit, thank you to a great caring staff.

Received my flight confirmation and now see that I have to pay $30 for a CARRY ON BAG, FOR EACH WAY?...so for 2 of us traveling this is an additional $120 for a carry-on bag? A lifetime of flying and I have never seen any airline charge extra for one carry-on bag. It looks like if I do not do it online it will be double that at the airport ($240 to take a carry-on bag? Really?).   I try to go to the Frontier website and it seems it also now will require me to pay an additional $6, $15, or $25 for my seat reservation before it will allow me to save my updated information (They have some random toll-free # for my contact phone#. I have never provided this # and so I am trying to update so they at least have my cell# in case they need to reach me.)  I call customer service at 801-401-9000 and after waiting on hold more than 25 minutes, the representative asks (she was polite at first) if I booked direct on their website or 3rd party. While I was pulling up my email to check who I booked through (Travelocity.com), she hung up on me and I went to their survey with no way to get back to talk to a live person.  Very disappointed that after booking a reservation, their website is not so user friendly and now it seems you can't get any help getting through it.

Quick, great tasting pizza with a wonderful selection of fresh ingredients, and you can add anything you wish! Friendly staff at this location too.

First visit was great. After a few recommendations from friends to stop in, I wanted to try a taste. The boiled pound of jumbo shrimp and corn on the cob in the mild sauce hit the spot. Friendly bartender was a nice plus. Families seemed to enjoy the fun birthday atmosphere. Thanks for a good dinner experience.
