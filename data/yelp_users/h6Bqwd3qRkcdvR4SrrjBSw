Never fly allegiant! They cancelled my flight due to "weather" even though every other flight leaving the area was on time. I was promised a refund at the gate, but when I called customer service (and waited on hold for 45 minutes) they refused to give me a refund or even a voucher for future travel.  They also told me they wouldn't transfer me to a supervisor. Worst customer service I have ever experienced with an airline! I will never do business with this company again.

This place is adorable! I went here for brunch with friends and we loved sitting outside with the trees and birds. The food was affordable and delicious.  They stop serving breakfast at 11:00 on weekends, so come early if that's what you want!

My husband and I eat here at least once a month, we love it!  The strawberry butterfish roll is amazing and we love the happy hour deals!! The name recently changed to Rock Lobster, but the menu seemed to stay the same.
