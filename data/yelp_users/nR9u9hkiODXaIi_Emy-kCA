They've done a number of arrangements for us and their designs are really cool. Sure they do a lot of corporate events and arrangements for hospital gift shops, but where they shine is in contemporary arrangements. Give them a little leeway for creativity and you'll be wowed, and for a good price, too.  If you're a DIY kind of bride, you can buy your flowers through them and use the shop to put together your arrangements. If you need guidance, you can hire a designer to assist.   They have a huge selection of containers (vases, etc.).

Visited Sophie's for the first time on Saturday night. We arrived around 7:10pm for a 7:30pm reservation and although the place was maybe 1/4 full, we were told we had to wait for a table. We got a drink at the bar and caught up with friends.  For starters we had the pate while our friends got the salmon rolls. Definitely not made to order as they were brought out moments later. They raved about the rolls. We thought the pate was good. Be sure to put mustard and honey on every bite.  I didn't see it on the menu, but apparently entrees come with a house salad. It was lightly dressed. The rolls you get, though, are incredible. Don't be afraid to ask for more--they are generous with them.   For entrees I had the orange duck. It was just ok. The duck was cooked well and had good flavor, but the risotto under it was a bit mushy and lacked flavor. I'd pass on that.  Hubby had the beef and it was outstanding. Super tender and flavorful. Get more rolls to mop up the sauce. This is definitely the dish they do best.  For dessert we had the crepes. They were also just ok. Frozen fruits on top, and you couldn't really taste the almond past (we think the menu was supposed to say paste) filling.  I'm glad we checked it out, but it kind of just gets checked off the list. Not outstanding, but not bad, either. Three courses (plus salad) in three hours. We waited a LOOOONG time for entrees. It was brightly lit inside, so I wouldn't go there for romance. I think they have a room for private parties, if you're interested, since we saw a birthday cake go in and out :)

I was a member at Bally's for four years. It's actually quite big, with an area for treadmills/ellipticals/bikes (this is where the TVs are), an area for all of the weight machines, a back room for free weights, and a huge aerobics room. It's kept fairly clean, and there's a seldom a wait for machines. Things get fixed fairly quickly. What's great about this gym is that it's definitely not a "see and be seen" gym. Nope--you can go in with an old t-shirt and no makeup and not feel bad about it at all. Plenty of parking at the strip mall (safe, even for early mornings).  Bally's had some financial trouble, so they've relaxed their membership requirements a lot. The reason I left was three fold:  1. An apathetic staff--I think just two people knew my name. They turned over staff quite a bit, but it also seemed like no one really cared. 2. They kept cutting hours. It used to be open something like 5am to midnight. They just kept slicing hours off both end until, when I left, Saturday hours were just 8am to 6pm. Seriously? On a Saturday? But I get to pay the same, of course. 3. I like taking classes, but they didn't offer many, and again, there was a lot of no-shows and turnover on instructors.  So if you like doing your own thing, you'll definitely find the "stuff" there to get a great workout. It really is big. They have a childcare area and a huge locker room (with showers!).

We were the unfortunate recipients of $200 in Romano's gift cards, so we've eaten there a few times recently. The birthday dinner we had was ok. We started with some of their new appetizers. Pass on them. The pesto bean bruschetta lacked flavor (where was the pesto??) and should have been served warm. The peppers were ok. The stuffed mushrooms were just boring. Our entrees came next. I had a pumpkin ravioli, which was quite good. Hubby got the trio and didn't even bring the spaghetti home. He said it was terrible. Birthday dessert was chocolate cake--it was so bland it went uneaten. The canoli weren't worth it, either.  We went back on a Saturday night. Was told there was a 45 minute wait. After 45 minutes they started seating people who ARRIVED AFTER US. When I complained, she said they had a reservation. I call bullsh-t on that. Then they seated ANOTHER group that arrived after us. Then she said there were 7 more parties before us. I told her to look around--there weren't 7 parties left to be seated. I was pissed. There was no apology. And no one over the age of 35 to complain too.  Our waiter was Aaron. it took him 8 minutes to greet us. We asked him three times for water for the table. We never received the promised plate to share our woefully under-dressed salad. I had the salmon entree and hubby had the porkchop. Both were cooked beautifully (and I had asked for the salmon pretty rare)--really perfect. Too bad they had NO FLAVOR. It was such a shame. It was a terrible dinner, over all...  F--- me, I still have $40 to spend. Hubby and I went several years ago and loved it. What happened??

We went last night for the Sonoran dogs. They were outstanding. As one Yelper said, it's the best bun she's ever had. They taste like butter and so pillowy soft. We each ate two plus had horchata (which was just eh) and were stuffed.  It does look like one of those joints where you think, "This is gonna make me sick". And yah, it wasn't the cleanest. But it was really, really good. The bacon is thin, I believe, so it cooks up faster on the grill.   Note: it's a CASH ONLY place. Plenty of parking.

Went back and the horchata was delish. Hubby had street tacos and thought the flavor was great. I stuck with my faves, the $2.50 desert dogs. Get two, really.

This place had amazing reviews so i was excited to get two pairs of shoes fixed. I dropped them off last Wednesday, paid in advance, and was told they would be ready on Wednesday for pickup. Just showed up and they were not done. Seriously? A week and they're not done? He said they had a lot of work, so maybe they don't need your business either. I asked for a refund and walked out. Really disappointing. You had my number, could have called. I'm only off on Wednesdays to run these errands.

Hubby and I ate here in March on a Saturday night. They have a lovely outdoor patio, but we were quickly shown to an empty table inside. They were fairly busy. Our waitress seemed a bit scattered as we had to ask for the wine list, beverage refills, etc. Check the specials board for yourself, because they won't be explained to you.  No offense to Marcello's if I am wrong, but I would bet my paycheck that the majority of the food is frozen. There's just no way it could be made fresh and come out that fast. Having said that, I had a seafood ravioli. Didn't care for the coarse texture of the filling; sauce was ok. I can't remember what hubby ate. Medium size portions (we ate all of ours but didn't get a starter or dessert). We didn't get bread refilled. The rosemary olive oil was nice though.  As always, I ask what desserts they make in house. Two of the six or so.   If you're looking for an un-special (sorry, made up word), fast dinner then this would be fine.

We went to La Stalla on a Saturday night. It's a warm, cozy restaurant that appears to attract an older crowd. Reservations were not needed.  First, the bread you get to start seems commercially made. It's really unremarkable and not worth eating on it's own (or with the balsamic they give you). Instead, hold onto it and use it to mop up the sauce from your entree.  Second, during the summer they have a pre-fixe menu. If you're on a budget, one person can get the pre-fixe and the other just an entree and you'll have more than enough food. It's three courses and a glass of wine, so it was a great deal.  Third, prices online appear to be lower than in the restaurant (although I could be wrong; it just seems cheaper online than what we saw at the restaurant).  We did just that--pre fixe and entree-- and started with a generous caprese salad. Thick slices of tomatos and mozzarella. It was delicious.  Next, hubby got the tagliatelle alla toscana. It was really just average. Instead, you should get the sweet potato ravioli. Eat just three of your six three-bite pods, and use that bread you've been saving to fill up on the sauce (after all, the cream sauce won't be nearly as yummy the next day!).  We finished with the cannoli, which weren't overly sweet. Two small lemon-ricotta filled (we couldn't taste the white chocolate) ones.

We visited Harlow's around 9am on a Monday morning. We were seated promptly at a booth near the bar. It was nice to see "regulars" interacting, but we probably won't become one of them. It seemed like everything was just cooked too hot. Here's what we had:  I had the pancake, egg and sausage patty combo. The eggs were supposed to be scrambled, but there was no fluffiness to them. Instead, they were closer to being fried and literally just chopped up with the spatula before plating. One small sausage patty. The pancakes tasted fine but were well cooked on one side (down, of course, as if I couldn't taste it if I couldn't see it??). $9. Ouch.  Hubby got eggs over easy, toast and hashbrowns (plus a shooter of juice--seriously, it's a tiny glass). His toast was cooked perfectly. The eggs were overdone and lacked runny yolks. He didn't complain about the hashbrowns, but even one side of those were darkened. Another $9.  We tried to share a regular order of biscuits and gravy, but it just wasn't that great. For $7 you get three split biscuits (these were decent--definitely buttermilk and the perfect balance between dense and fluffy) smothered with gravy. I think I saw 3 tiny bits of sausage, and the rest just tasted mainly of flour. We left it half uneaten.  All in all, you don't go here for the ambiance, and now I wouldn't go for the food. It's sad that as we passed a McDonald's hubby said, "I bet their bacon and egg McMuffin would've been better."

We're in our 30s with no children and still love this waterpark. We typically go during the week, and, if you arrive early, you can snag lounge chairs under a cabana for relief from the sun (so you can actually spend a long time there).  We love how it feels uncrowded, with not much waiting for slides. The staff is friendly and helpful. The grounds are spotless (bathrooms need a little more upkeep, though). Only one slide was not working when we were there.   I like how they have lots of levels of play. Small splash pools for little ones, and everything from tiny slides to fully enclosed twisty ones. Some slides require a tube, which is readily supplied by the ride. You can rent a raft for just $5, and you get $1 back when you return it. The raft is for wave pool.  We love the free parking, and you can always print a coupon from their website.  We finally had lunch there and have to say, it's really not good. The chili on the chili cheese fries is terrible, although you do get a large portion. The cheeseburgers were small and barely lukewarm. The pizza is probably your best bet. We saw a mom buy a whole one for about $16. She asked them to slice it into 10 pieces to feed more kids. Everyone in line wished they had ordered it!

I took my car in a few different times for an oil change. I was assigned a service guy who would greet me, get my concerns, and then, afterward, tell me how my car did. Only EVERY SINGLE TIME I'd drop off or pick up my car, he was nowhere to be found. Ever.  At the first oil change I specifically asked them to check my tires, knowing I was close to needing new ones. When I picked up my car, I asked about the tires, and of course no one knew what I was talking about. They finally rounded up my service guy who said, sure, I needed tires. I asked about the price and he said, "Um, can you get the number off your tires and call me later for the price?" Awesome service.   I did have them put on two new tires the following week and asked they go on rear of the vehicle. They put them on the front.  Hubby took his Jeep in for an oil change and they never looked into the leak he specifically asked them about.  There's just no follow up. It's always sloppy work (only once did we get the "free" car wash that comes with the oil change). And I shouldn't work so hard to try and get them to fix other things on my dang car!

In the past the service has been decent. Yesterday i brought in a pair of $70 boots for rrpair. Wawyne claimed they were chepa and made of plastic. Then i showed him my Coach shoe that my god had munched on. He said it was a white gold leather and that i should bring the mate back so the repairs would match. Brilliant! So i brought the pair back just now and the shorter guys says they dont have that color. WHY DID WAYNE HAVE ME DRIVE ALL THE WAY BACK?! This guy claims he does all the work and WayNe wouldn't know. Well, Wayne came from the back wearing a work apron and said he could fix it. What a ridiculous waste of my time. Really disappointing service from a place i used to frequent. Also, time to glue on my "cheap plastic heel" was over a week. A freaking week. Pass on Abes.

The search for decent Chinese food in the valley continues, as Jong Wah won't be our go-to place.  We started with the Popo Platter. Though we were one of just three tables there on a Saturday night around 7:30, it took nearly 30 minutes for our platter to come out. It was plated beautifully. Unfortunately, the fried shrimp had an odd texture I had to pass on, and the crab ragoon and ribs were barely lukewarm. The highlight was the egg rolls. These were clearly made in-house because the insides were crunchy. As in, not previously frozen and then defrosted mushiness. They were very good.  We ordered Kung Pao chicken and a beef and brocolli dish, plus house fried rice. The two dishes were well spiced. Often spicy dishes are just ungodly spicy where you can't taste anything else, but these actually had some flavor. It's just too bad the quality of beef was so poor you wouldn't want to eat it by itself.  The house fried rice was outstanding, with huge shrimp. We'd highly recommend the rice and eggrolls.  We also had a coupon, and our bill, with one soda, was $40. Ouch. We couldn't make heads or tails of our itemized, handwritten bill.  They do have an outdoor patio.

We visited around 7:30pm on Saturday night. We sat at a table and ordered 4 rolls and 2 salads off the menu. First, our server (and the owner and others who stopped by the table) were the friendliest dang staff we've ever met. They were all so happy and thanked us a lot for coming--and were just two in a packed dining room.  Our rolls were very good, although packed a bit too loosely (could be our fault as we subbed in soy paper). We thought the quality was excellent.  Next time we want to try the conveyor belt system, which looked like fun.

Went early during First Friday last week and scored a spot at the bar. Thank god for that, because this place was tiny, and I wouldn't recommend it for groups.  Having said that, we ordered whatever the bartender suggested (4 different drinks in all), and found them all to be outstanding. We would've liked to try some of their rums, but there was no help offered figuring out how to sample those--it's a bit overwhelming!  The nice thing is that you can order food from the adjoining restaurant. However, the jerk spice on the perfectly cooked scallops was so spicy that I could not eat it.

This is actually a nice location with lots of parking and plenty of outdoor seating. However,  the food was terrible. We had fish, shrimp, fries and onion rings. First of all, you can't upgrade your fries to onion rings, which is ridiculous, even for an upcharge. But the worst part was that everything tasted the same. Shrimp were dry. Fish was flavorless. Fries were overcooked. The onion rings did have a different batter, a bit sweet, and got their only taste from the salt sprinkled on them. The fish was just a square, like you'd get from your grocer's freezer, so I''m not sure what we're paying for. Even their sauce was like a sweeter ketchup. The rice krispy treat was a great consistency but tasted like coconut.  Overall, a huge waste of $20.

Hubby and I needed a splurge night so we hit up Christopher's. The atmosphere is nice, upscale, with a few different seating areas. Very professional service. We were impressed with all of that.  We had 3 glasses of wine.  Still, they have a great (if somewhat snobbish--really, what's this nonsense about "Anything But Chardonnay"?!) wine list.They tout a big pour, but it didn't look that generous to me.  We started with the escargot en croute. You get 6 small snails under an incredibly buttery, flakey crust. I wished for more protein, but believe me, not a flake of crust was left on the serving dish. It was so yummy.  I had the duck pizza. I thought the duck was a bit dry and there just wasn't enough flavor on it. I also got the mac n cheese. It was also just ok. I didn't care for the weird strips of ham--seemed like a clunky execution. Both went home with us so hubby could finish the next day.  Hubby got a steak. It's served a la carte, so his $38 got him steak. Maybe 6 oz. In a drizzle of red wine sauce. With a bit of charred something dusted on the rim. While it was well prepared, he spent the meal digging large peppercorns out of it, so they wouldn't get stuck in his gums. The waiter recommended the gnocchi, and it was probably the best we've ever had. Silky smooth texture. It was incredible. I mostly ate that. GET THE GNOCCHI.  We finished with the tower of mousse, which was good.  All in, we spent $174. While it was quite good, I think we wanted to be blown away for the price, since for us it was definitely a splurge. I'm glad we went, but I wouldn't say it was a terrific value. However, given it's location in the Biltmore shopping area, maybe they don't need to care about value.

We went with another couple to The Mission and celebrated our anniversary. It was dark inside but wasn't stuffy or creepy. Our waiter was relaxed and helpful. He suggested the avocado margarita. Give it a shot--you just may want a refill (I did!).  We started with the delicious guac and shared a few small plates (our waiter was spot-on with his recommendations re: quantity). By far the best part of the night was the pork shoulder tacos. They were make your own with falling off the bone meat. We finished with pumpkin bread pudding.  Never rushed or harried, we had a great time and recommend going with a few people you can sample the dishes with. Make a reservation if you go during peak weekend hours.

We've been to Tuck Shop a couple of times. We recommend a reservation for peak weekend hours since the place is tiny. We've had the same slightly snotty, disinterested waiter both times, but bar service has been a bit friendlier.  Can't say enough about the amazing food. I believe we actually fought over the waffles last time. I'd pass on the lobster mac if i went back, but most everything else was delicious.   Definitely recommend this for a date night. It's the perfect neighborhood restaurant!

Ate here on Friday of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Around 1pm the line was quite long. A couple of things to note, if you've not been here before:  --Apparently the thing to do is snag a table BEFORE ordering. Everyone around us sent up someone to place the order for everyone else. Nice... --The menu lacks descriptions. What's on the Kahuna burger? No idea. You could probably ask at the register, but it isn't really the place to dally. Oh, and yep, there's only one register, and the woman working it was also the bartender, so if you want another round of beers or another side order of fries, apparently you just get to cut.  We both had burgers--me the swiss and mushroom, and he had the Big Earl. I got unpalatable sweet potato fries--they were fried beyond recognition and tasteless (we didn't see any attempt at seasoning). Hubby liked the spicy mayo on his burger, but his giant onion rings were also over-fried. So if you were one of all the other patrons who received beautifully golden fried goods, sorry for staring jealously at your plates, but we were pretty pissed.  We also had a milkshake. It comes out of a machine.   Ample parking in the back. Loved the old photos inside. Burgers had a nice char flavor. Probably won't come back, as most others noted.

Gallo Blanco has made so many best-of lists we weren't sure it could live up to the hype. But the food did.  We came on a Thursday night around 7pm and waited in the bar for a table. Get the Paloma--it's like a marg but with grapefruit juice. Not too tart, it was perfectly mixed.  We had a couple of tortas--they were amazing. If you're super hungry, get a couple of sides, too. The chorizo had a nice bite (as did the salsas they brought). My pork was tender and flavorful, though I think we all wished we had gotten the open-face Naco (I think) torta. Hubby got the burrito and said it was ok. We finished with tres leches which was just ok; I wouldn't get it again.  The service was hipster-laid back (so don't expect it to be attentive, ok?).  Our only other comment, and the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5, was the damn noise level. Seriously, it's loud in there.   But yah, we'd definitely go back. The food was really yummy and reasonably priced!

Great pizzas, reasonably priced bottles of wine, and a decent ambiance rates this 5 stars for us. We've never sat at the bar. Other tables are smallish and close together, but the overall ambient noise makes it feel more private.  The duck pizza was rich--a real treat. Anything with sausage was really flavorful.  Being on the older, uncooler side of things, we tend to hit Parlor early in the night, since by 8pm there's a line out the door, and it's populated by the, ahem, "Scottsdale" crowd.   Be prepared to valet.

Ate at the Nile Cafe last night. It's a medium sized restaurant in a strip mall. Sparse decor with a couple of TVs. VERY family friendly, as the proprietor had his kid there.   The best part about the place was the kind, attentive service. Our pretty waitress and the owner both thanked us a couple of times for stopping in. They just seemed really grateful.  As other reviewers noted, the small sampler plate of hummus was a nice free starter. I had the salad with my dinner. It was a basic plate of lettuce (with a decent dressing). I recommend the lentil soup, instead.  I had the gyro schwarama, which came with a generous portion of rice. It was enough to have left overs for lunch today, but it was all a bit greasy (though, in their defense, greek is almost always a bit greasy). Tender, flavorful meat.  The highligh of the meal was the caring servers.

We love Angel Sweet. Here's why:  1. There's always plenty of parking. 2. The kids working there are nice. 3. They have the BEST PEANUT BUTTER GELATO I have ever eaten.  4. They don't limit you to the number of flavors you can get in a size, like some other places do.  So go ahead, try that super dark with the peanut butter and the cheesecake and fall in love with Angel Sweet. Just be prepared to sit on the hard bench outside or take it to go--they have only three or four tables inside.

We went last Friday for the first time since last fall and holy crap, when did it become such a cool place to be?! We used to get a table on the awesome patio but this time had to squeeze into a tiny table inside. Oh well. Good for them!  Parking is a bitch so I found the gravel lot and hoofed it. It's ok--you don't have to wear hooker heels here to fit in.  Happy hour is a decent deal--$2 off drinks. But when the full price is just $7-9 for a mixed drink, don't feel bad if you miss the 6pm cut off! My fave is the ahi tuna burger. It's not ground up--it's a giant hunk 'o fish, cooked perfectly. I paired it with the sweet potato fries. If they're from a frozen bag, I'd be shocked. Or maybe I don't care; they at least look homemade! My girlfriend got the tacos and raved--two (plus the rice, etc.) made for a filling dinner. Portions are perfect.  Drinks are clever and super strong, so, please, get a cab. Love the mixed crowd here--everyone is welcome!

The fact that it was difficult to find doesn't factor into the terrible rating, but for those of you who need help (as I did), it's on Mayo to the far west side of the complex (by the chain stores, not in the center with the theater).  Pulling up, you see a nice building with stone work. The lounge and bar area were beautiful. NOTE: This is where you need to sit if you want to have a conversation with your companions. In the main seating area, which is big, open, cold (literally and figuratively) and with little decor, it's very loud.  We went last Sunday to the free AZ Chicks with Picks show. It was fine. Some of the performers were even good. It's really the food and service that I find fault with.  Hubby started with the steak quesadillas. At $15 it's steep for an appetizer, but the portion is large. The steak was plentiful and well seasoned (good grill taste). I had the apricot and brie crisp, which came out half burned. It's VERY sweet, although the fresh arugula tries its best to balance it.  What got me was we were literally four bites into our apps when the bus boy delivers our entrees. Seriously? Drops them off and leaves. The kitchen doesn't know enough to time food? The busser isn't smart enough to see we have plates full of food already??  I had the shrimp and scallops. It had a terrible fishy smell and was literally inedible. The sauce was too hot (spicy). The rice was crunchy and undercooked. My mixed veggies were coated in oil. Hubby had the chewy steak, strange mashed potatoes, and also mixed veggies (interestingly, he had rapini, while I did not, and his had no grill marks but was still swimming in oil).   We left our entrees uneaten and filled up on a pizza cookie for dessert. If you must eat there, I'd stick to the burgers, which get good reviews, or the apps, as the entrees are expensive and terrible.   The only time our waitress showed any kindness was to thank us as we were leaving. Damn us and our over-tipping.

I read the reviews before going in and was still couldn't figure out really what to do--seat yourself (because you're not greeted in any way), order at the counter (yet we didn't see menus by the register).... So we stood around awkwardly trying to decide to sit at one of the dirty 2 tops or take a bigger one. There were only two occupied tables when we arrived on a Saturday night. Finally someone came out and waved us to a table, and, in the end, we ordered seated (no "order here" sign either).  When people say it's tiny, they really mean, "this is almost NYC style sit on top of each other or at least have a hard time winding your way between tables".  But let's get down to the food... I had the fish taco and the carne taco. Both were ok. If you're looking for fancy toppings, move along. You get some shredded cabbage from a bag on top of your tacos. That's it. So you have to take advantage of the salsa bar, which is fine. I got the combo, so the rice and beans were included. And they were awesome. The rice was light and fluffy and the beans were amazing.  Hubby had the cochinita pibil burro. We joked that it wouldn't taste nearly as good as the stuff cooked underground in banana leaves but we were so wrong. If food could give you an orgasm, this would do it. Just beans (those super smooth beans again!) and meat in here, and the meat is to die for. Super juicy and flavorful.  And everyone drinking out of giant cups? Yah, it's the horchata. And yah, at $3.99 it's pricey, but it's also the best I've had anywhere. Save it for dessert, because it is that good.  So the service was "eh" (they were scraping chairs along the floor and bumping into me constantly as they rearranged for a large party coming in) and the music was loud but kept cutting out. So why five stars? It was the pork, man, and the horchata. I would stop by for just those two things, and then die happy.

La Condesa, I give up on you. We try and try to excuse the terrible service, but no more. It's not worth it. It's too slow and inattentive and they just don't give a damn, so I'll take my $33 elsewhere.  This time we were disappointed by the food, too. We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it?   In the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :(

As the others have mentioned, the decor and service are a bit lacking, we have to agree. The Nanny was on TV when we ate here last Friday night. At 7:30pm we were the only table. We counted no fewer than 7 employees (including children who helped serve us).  I started with a ginger beer. I didn't know what it was before I ordered, but it was so strong I couldn't drink it. The (head?) waitress later asked if it was too strong and I said yes. She brought a to-go cup and told me to put half ginger beer and half water together at home.  I had the goat curry. It was amazing. Super tender and flavorful; just watch for the tiny bones. The oxtail was sold out. Hubby had the jerk chicken which was moist with a bit of a kick.   Sides were rice, a warm cabbage slaw, and plantains. Overall, we thought the food was excellent for the price, but it's really not a great date place.

We were a bit disappointed by Relish.  I'll overlook the fact that it looks like a gentleman's club from the 60s and has never been updated. And I'll try to forgive the ridiculously slow service where there were maybe 5 tables and just one waitress who serviced only one table at a time. Or the fact that we had to ask for drink refills... repeatedly...  No, it was the lukewarm, overcooked burger with disappointing toppings that really did us in. I had cold, flavorless bacon. Non existent cheese. My husband raved about the mushrooms on his burger but stated they must've forgotten to season the meat. It really was disappointing for a place that specializes in burgers.  We capped off the meal with an adult milkshake. Yes, incredibly overpriced, but sooooooooooo good. Made me almost forget the crappy burger. *Almost*.

We visited Paletas Betty on Saturday night looking for a dessert after sushi. THe store was spotless and brightly lit. It was definitely minimalist on the inside, but we loved the fresh fruit display.  They have 8-10 flavors of popcycles plus some drink options (and even a frozen treats for pups). We both got the arroz con leche, which was sweet. You could really taste (and chew) the rice bits mixed with cinnamon.  We'd love to go back and taste the other flavors! Handmade, real fruits, local biz... Check it out!

Went to Degree 270 Saturday night with a girlfriend around 9pm. The casino was packed. They treat this like a Vegas hotspot, complete with velvet rope line leading up to a counter where you tell them where you're going and get ID'd and a bracelet. They also have a dress code (which seemed rarely enforced, considering all of the shorts, ripped jeans and flip flops we saw) and a $10 cover charge for men on some nights. So we had high expectations...  Which quickly crashed when we entered. There are a few lounge areas, but there are also odd high-top tables with linens like you'd find at a wedding. There were very few people, so the huge open areas just felt strange. The view was on 3 sides and great. Some people danced. It was too loud to be a place to lounge.  They're totally not a wine bar anymore--just a dance club. When I asked the bartender for something girly but not too high calorie, he suggested a vodka and red bull. Or vodka and pineapple. Then just shrugged. See, there actually is a difference between a mixologist and a bartender! And as others have noted, they do serve drinks in totally tacky plastic glasses. I paid $8.50 for a vodka and tonic.  It was a really mixed group, in age and dress. We wouldn't go back.

Went for happy hour last Saturday night and found a buzzing yet not overly crowded bar scene. Slow yet friendly service. Great half price tequilas, if you know what you're doing (we did not, and were not offered any help deciphering their giant tequila offerings).  Moved to the dining room for dinner. Rushed server in a slow room brought us our appetizer and entree at the same time, which always irritates me, but the pork tacos for two (make your own) were delicious (I'd skip the "tamale" appetizers next time). Finished the night with an awesome rice pudding and sopapillas.  We'd go back--I loved the atmosphere and decor!

We've used them a few times for alterations, which have been very slow (as in, promised by a certain time and a week later still not done). They have a sign up which says they clean leather, but when I asked about it, they told me they send it to another place locally, so it would be cheaper to go there directly. I went, and it wasn't.   So maybe just use them for men's shirts, because they have a great price on those, and leave the finer pieces to another shop.

We visited on a Friday nights and enjoyed the Yelp Eats menu. It was maybe 2/3 full with room to sit at the bar.   Our server, Gary, was great, although he did try to explain to me what pepitas and rapini was (um, thanks, but those are pretty easy ones). The best part was that our courses never felt rushed, and you actually had time between them to chat and relax.  We both started with our own chopped salads. If you're not a smoked salmon fan, they can substitute chicken. It was delicious--great mix of textures.   Hubby had the Berkshire pork loin, which I thought was just ok (I thought it was a little dry and lacked flavor, but he liked it). He loved the fruit compote on top but thought the white corn spoon bread was strange (it was fluffy yet dry). I had the scallops and loved every damn thing about that dish.  We finished with the bread pudding, which wasn't overly sweet or huge in size.  They didn't have many wines by the glass, and the ambience was pretty loud. Other than that, we thought it was a great meal out and would highly recommend it!

Went to Bonfire Friday night because Mabel's on Main was closed for a private party (thanks, jerks, for not updating your website or anything). It was 6:15 and maybe 2/5th full. When we walked in we were hit with the overwhelming odor of FISH. My god, it was terrible (and only salmon was on the menu, that I recall). Thankfully, we stuck around because the rest of the night looked up.  They have happy hour every day until close. That meant a couple bucks off beer, half price well drinks, etc., but glasses of wine were full priced (and the by the glass list was decent!) and so was the food.  My friend and I picked three apps to share. She had the grilled cheese. While I didn't try it, she said it was great and it was beautifully plated (everything was--presentation is great here). I did have a couple of her house-made BBQ chips, which were outstanding.  We shared an order of 4 pork belly sliders. They were incredible. From the soft but toasted bread on the bottom to the interesting toppings... it was great. I had the spare ribs. They were fall off the bone tender but WAY too sweet for me. Still, I ate them all.  We made a meal of just three small plates, so it was a great value.  The inside is strange--it's been vastly changed from the days it was Furio. I loved the new wall decorations. It's dark and could be romantic, if it weren't for giant TVs all over. That gave it a sports bar feel. Still, we give it an enthusiastic 4 stars!

When they say a serious slice, they mean it. These are GIANT (and we're big eaters, folks). For $5 you get a slice of cheese pizza and a drink. You can upgrade combos with salads, wings, etc.  Extra toppings are $.50 EACH. Hint: they are really generous with mushrooms, which are thick and meaty.  While the crust was firm (you can actually pick up the monster slice--no folding needed) it wasn't great (on the crusty end--just not great flavor to it).  We're big fans of the slightly spicy sauce though.

We were excited to Casablanca for date night, as we loved it when it was the Estate House. We arrived a bit early for our 7:30pm reservations and were led outside, past all of the cozy seats inside. I thought it odd we weren't asked for a preference.   But wait--it got worse. We were also taken past all of the cozy couches outside facing the movie playing and seated at this strange area way in the back. Between our two chairs, which overlooked the street, we had a giant heater and small table (in May). So much for date night. (The light-up menus are totally cool, though the selection is small.)  But wait--it still gets worse. Apparently our corner was the smoking area (!?), so they actually seated me, a severe asthmatic, in the middle of it. Thanks.  We ordered a crab dip, the sliders and the tacos. While waiting, we did get our well-mixed drinks. But then our waiter totally disappeared. After 35 minutes a water guy apologized for our slow food service. After 45 minutes it finally appeared. The two pork dishes were ok--but served totally lukewarm. The tacos were beautifully plated; the limes even had perfect grill marks on them. But couldn't they put that much care into getting me my damn food in a timely manner? While it's still hot? We didn't care for the crab dip, but that could be a personal thing. The plantain chips were yummy.  The final rub came with the service. Our waiter literally never came back after taking our order. When we decided we had enough, we actually went inside and stood at the empty bar and asked for our tab. Interestingly, no one thought that was odd.  So there we go. Bad service, mediocre food. We won't be back.

At last--a place to find a PRETTY bra in a non-traditional size. The owners are certified fit specialists. The store was beautiful and intimate, and the ladies are super discreet (they'll even help guys find a sexy surprise!). We love the huge selection of gorgeous bras and panties as well as lingerie in plus sizes. They even have a growing selection of workout bras, all for reasonable prices. They're located in the Casa Paloma shopping center. We highly recommend them for their service, selection and great prices.

We went last night for the $2 admission to their haunted house. We waited about an hour and a half in line.   Pros: the sets were absolutely incredible. Really movie quality in a lot of places and just beautiful (but also kind of without rhyme or reason--if there's a theme, we didn't get it). Great for kids because there wasn't anything scary about it. But...  Cons: there are steps, so half of it is not accessible, if that matters to you. And here's the real problem: it just wasn't scary. You walked through a bunch of different rooms, and some were really wide open (especially in the basement). And there was NOTHING going on. I thought maybe the actors were on break. Upstairs there was mostly animatronics (this is probably misspelled, but we mean to say, monsters being moved mechanically), not people or things that pop out at you. At one point we walked through a hallway with fake arms poking out at us, and we kept expecting one to be real. We were disappointed when nothing was. We walked through an Egyptian chamber with... nothing. And we walked through an ice room with... nothing. And we walked through a room with two immobile zombies DJing with... nothing.   So if you think this will be like the Nest or the 13th Floor, you will be disappointed. And if you pay more than $8 for it, you'll be pissed off. But you can take kids because they'll see creepy things and not know what they're missing at the better haunted houses around town.

Made 7:30 reservations for a Friday night. Started at the totally-dead bar for a well-mixed cocktail. It definitely fit the new "artesan cocktail" trend and was similarly priced. Hubby had a jack and coke.  We started with the head cheese appetizer. Although the waiter could describe the process of making head cheese, it was clear, once we received our dish, that he had never eaten it (it wasn't gelatenous at all). It was delicious, even though it took nearly 40 min to leave the kitchen in a half-full dining room. Our dining companions got the olive plate.  For mains, hubby got a delicious pizza. Not big enough for sharing as a main course, it was definitely a personal-pizza size. The crust was fluffy and flavorful. I ate a seasonal pumpkin pasta dish, which was a bit too al dente for my taste but still delicious.  For dessert we shared the applesauce cake, which was delicious.  So, for pros: --Comfy chairs (and thank god for that, because the service was sloooooooow) --Good food --Takes reservations --Has their own parking --Love the rollup doors for a fresh breeze --Quality cocktails  Cons: --Really ugly chairs and tables (think: Denny's ugly) --Small portions --Really slow service (in a half-empty restaurant).  Still, we'd definitely recommend this place to others!

We were there Saturday night during the Sunnyslope Art Walk and experienced just a 25 minute wait for four for seating on the patio. Don't enter from the street, because the woman behind the bar did not nicely tell me to see the hostess on the other side. Don't put yourself through that--just enter from the parking lot/patio side.  Having said that, the patio was gorgeous. There's a nice fire pit, lots of little seating areas, and gorgeous old trees and vines.  The service, on the other hand, was pretty terrible. The sweet, young hostess tried her best to get us served, but it was futile. We sat at a dirty table for 10 min. or so. Then sat another 15 before she got a waitress for us. Our meals came out in a timely manner, but we had to ask for more water, ask for the the wine menu, etc. We got so tired of waiting we decided against another round and dessert. What surprised me the most was that there seemed to be no one experienced supervising a really young staff. No one (like a manager or owner) came through to check on tables or apologize for the wait at the table and lack of service.  The food was a bit better. My girlfriend had the BLT and chips. The sandwich was large and a bit charred but she said it was great. I had the bruschetta. I highly recommend the spicy copa and pesto, which was excellent. I'd pass on the brie, apple and figs, as the figs were terribly bitter and the over-sauced bread quickly became soggy.  The wine and beer lists were reasonably priced for by the glass or bottle.  We're hoping they improve on service for our next visit. It smelled so good that we'd like to give them another shot. I just hope it wasn't actually the Little Caesar's nearby...

I resisted eating Zoyo for months after they opened because I was afraid I'd get hooked and be there every day. And, yep, it's addictive. They always have new flavors to try, but right now my fave is salted caramel. It's incredible. I usually pass on toppings.  As other have suggested, it'd be nice if they had smaller containers. But I am impressed that they can keep the store so clean with the giant roll-up doors open. They lead to a nice patio that's sufficiently removed from the street that you're not just breathing exhaust.

I went to Praying Monk on a Saturday night in July with another couple. When we walked in they asked if we had reservations. Well, they're not on Open Table, so no... Maybe you have to call? On the phone? People still do that??? (check their website for a link to City Eats, for reservations). Anyway, you should probably make one because the place is pretty small. We snagged a four top in the bar.  I loved the atmosphere. It was warm, with all of the wood, not snooty. Our waiter was a little slow, but he was nice. I wouldn't call this a hipster hangout. There were some pretty people (Scottsdale style), but also some old folks like us, and it didn't turn into any Sharks versus Jets, so all seem welcome.  The menu is a bit small and not super adventurous, but that's ok. I started with the fried cauliflower. I was pleasantly surprised to find them more roasted (they're definitely not batter-fried), with just a touch of buffalo sauce (not too hot for a wimp like me) and a few bits of bleu cheese (could've used more).  For the entree I had the pulled pork sandwich. Here's where I learned a tough lesson: when you bite into a sandwich and say it's the best pork you've ever eaten, you should NOT be sitting next to your husband who owns 6 devices for cooking meat and fancies himself a damn good pork butt smoker. My mistake. But it was so good. Great meat to bun ratio, it was juicy and flavorful... just fantastic. My side was the vinegar-y slaw, which was so good I tried to replicate it at home the next weekend. My girlfriend got the pork two ways--good, she said, but she needed a starch with it, she thought. Hubby got a burger but subbed nearly everything on it (and they were quite nice about it!).  Our drinks were really well mixed. I gave it five stars because I thought the atmosphere, price and quality of food makes Praying Monk one of the best VALUES in downtown Scottsdale. I felt in other restaurants I'd be paying more for what we got.

Bar Louie, I wanted to love you. You got a great makeover in bright colors and fun design, the bar is well designed with nice TVs, the patio is large, and you appear to have a great happy hour.  But you sucked. We ate dinner early on a Sunday night. We sat at the bar. There were about 8 other tables occupied. We had surly bar service. I got a filthy wine glass (and the waitress forgot my order--look, if you want to look cool and not write it down, that's fine, but you can't FORGET it). It took 35 minutes for a burger and a sandwich. The surly waitress half-apologized, if "it's the cook's first day back" is an apology. We thought the quality of food was atrocious for the price. The highlight was my burger--it was small, overcooked and under-seasoned, but the buffalo sauce with bleu cheese was delicious together. I subbed steamed broc for fries. They were hard and not seasoned. Hubby's steak sandwich was a sad little thing, mostly bread.  Having said all that, if you just want to get in and out for some fun drinks, this place might be great. It has a lively atmosphere at prime drinking hours. It's great for a drink before or after the movies, but even Cadillac Ranch has better food. Sad.

We were here last Saturday for AZ Restaurant Week. We had a 6pm reservation and noticed the parking lot was FULL. They told our friends behind us that valet was full/closed, until they mentioned they had a dinner reservation, and then space miraculously opened. Note that street parking is by permit only, so valet is your only option.  Little Cleo's was pretty small and, disappointingly, didn't have any patio seating. It also appears to appeal more to an older crowd (or maybe we just ate at "older crowd" eating time!). But it was cool inside, a bit retro.  We started with shrimp and oysters. All amazing. Hubby had the best frog legs we've ever eaten, with a Thai chili sauce. I had the grilled octopus, which I would pass on. Hubby had fish and chips, saying the fish was really good. I had the mussels and squid ink pasta (again, just ok). For dessert hubby got the beignets, which were fluffy little pillows from heaven. They were amazing. I had the buttermilk tart, which needed a tad more fruit but was yummy.  So why the five stars if my food was only good? Well, first, I had three impeccable cocktails, at just $8 each. Second, our server was AMAZING. I mean, really, really good. She coursed the meal perfectly, checked in when appropriate, we wanted for nothing... She really made the experience perfect. It was a great atmosphere and a tremendous value, so they get 5 stars from me!

We took our Jeep to a "Jeep specialist" in Mesa that did a dreadful job and, what's worse, couldn't tell us what caused the new clunking/grinding sound when we picked it up. Disappointing. So we took it to Slaughter & Associates, who did a super thorough inspection job. The news was terrible ($1800-$2500 for a transmission rebuild), but they charged us just $25 for the estimate, communicated in a timely manner, tightened a couple of bolts they noticed were loose and (gasp!) recommended we consider a brake service soon. Proactively recommending services? AMAZING!  We felt really confident in their diagnosis and while we're choosing to trade in the  'ole clunker instead of getting the work done, we definitely have a new trusted mechanic in town. Got us in the same day, too.  THANK YOU BRIAN!!

Wow! This place has been open for 15 months--how have I not heard of it before now? Good wine by the glass options and decent bottle prices. The table next to us got extra fancy wine glasses because they bought a more expensive bottle. Strange, but ok.   We started out with arancini. Wish they had been a bit hotter, but they were yummy. 6 to an order. We also got two types of meat on bruchetta. Those were tender, flavorful and delicious.  We ordered two pizzas. The waitress said they had 6 slices but came with 8, and we thought it was plenty for two people. The pizzas were delicious.  We sat at the community table. Very nice inside; lively atmosphere. Try to get a reservation if you can. Great service. We were very happy!
