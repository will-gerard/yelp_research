We came in to have a pizza and wings. It took 30 minutes for the wings to come out and 45 minutes for the pizza!! Beyond ridiculous!!! Especially for a SLOW Tuesday night.

Surprisingly FAST service! Food was also very good. We had Generals Tso's chicken and also the sweet and sour combo dinners. I would recommend them to anyone!

First time ever to a Jimmy Johns, will NOT go back. The guy at the front register seemed like he didn't want to be there. I ordered a roast beef and cheese sub and a drink. I went and got my drink and the sub was ready by the time I got back to the pick up counter. I took the sub and then I opened it when I got to my truck.... I was very upset about the very bare sandwich of meat and cheese and the sub roll that I got was SO dry that it was actually hard to swallow. The sandwich taste was not that great at all. So, don't go here, take your business to subway.
