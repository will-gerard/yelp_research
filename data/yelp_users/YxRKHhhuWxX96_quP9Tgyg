this is probably the coolest diner in downtown phoenix. all organic ingredients, a kickass interior (it's super small, but totally rad), and great people working. say hi to the bearded jewish cook, andy, and he will make your food just the way you want it, and also, with love.  the food is totally cheap and tastes exquisite. you can also eat outside, if you want.   it's located on a nondescript corner in a residential area, so it's easy to miss, but this place is definitely worth checking out if you're downtown.  also, the hours up there ^^ say it's open until 5, but i am pretty sure they close at 3.

this is one of the best dive bars in phoenix. we go there all the time, and they have hot nuts, and cheap cigarettes, and crazy weirdos like a deaf guy with a giant beard that tried to feel my lady up and ex-hippies and old people.  they have a pinball machine, and a pool table, and jukebox and a claw machine and a table pac-man and that shooting deer rifle game. unfortunately the darts are a little too awkwardly placed to play.   the bartenders are amazing and have been there since probably before you were born. the drinks are pretty strong and reasonably priced.  there is also a sister bar located in sunnyslope which is even sketchier and just as awesome.

omg, this place is always freezing. which kind of rules, but kind of doesn't.  they have awesome bartenders (but my lady says she's kind of scared of them), and a bunch of pinball machines. the wheel of fortune one is so insanely fast and hard (lol), it's worthless to even play, though).  the drinks are always super super strong, and the pool tables are all in really good shape.   the prices are pretty good, too.  they have a crazy weird hand towel thing in the bathroom.  also, real darts (the kind that you can kill someone with)

this place is sooooooooooooooooo GOOOD.  the drinks are awesomely cheap, and they have an atm to take out all of your money to spend on so much booze because they only take cash.   monty is probably the coolest bartender to have ever walked the earth, and he always tells us he missed us whenever we come back. he tells us strange anecdotes about his life, that are hilarious and involve things that would probably send most people to therapy. and he makes the BEST burger i have ever tasted. seriously the best burger i have ever tasted. the best. the onion rings are so good too.   all the denny's waitresses from down across the street come hang out after (and before?) work. they have a couple of pool tables, and this sweet-ass old-school bowling game that costs like, a quarter and is old and made of wood, which instantly makes it awesome. and it sounds awesome.   AND! if all that wasn't enough to make this the greatest bar ever, they also have twilight zone pinball, which is THE BEST PINBALL GAME OF ALL TIME. we have won so many free games on that thing. everyone probably gets weirded out because we play pinball wizard by the who on the jukebox while we play.  except one negative. whenever monty (awesome) isn't working, some other cracked out babe works and she always closes the damn place at like 1, which is SO annoying (we're talking fridays and saturdays here--monty stays open til at least 2 even on tuesdays). and she always forgets our change and orders and everything else, really. and makes us feel like we're cracked out just by watching her.  basically, just go when monty is working (he looks like the guy painted on the wall next to the smoking area).

we used to go to this place all the time all the time to play pinball, cuz they have addam's family, which is the 2nd greatest pinball game ever, duh.  they have an amazing setup for darts--probably the best place to play darts in central phoenix--and a bunch of pool tables. sometimes they have bands playing, usually some older dudes.   the bartenders are nice and once one of them told us that we should be john lennon and yoko for halloween which was the awesomest thing a bartender has ever said, ever.  they have karaoke a lot, but usually it kind of sucks, because the people that run it are kind of a little too into themselves and do that whole annoying back-and-forth thing like they think they are funny (they're not). and they're the only ones that really even do the karaoke. no one else does it. also they sing, like, korn and eminem songs.  they have a white chocolate beer on tap, but i don't like it, it's creepy.   they might(?) have food (they do have a menu), but i've never seen it actually get made. or eaten.

this place used to be way better, when we were single. now that it's considered the hipster mecca of downtown phoenix, it's just kind of boring.  the drinks are still cheap, the bartenders are still nice, and the place is still a hole inside, but it's just not as fun as it used to be. still some good dj's like boris and alex and shane, but we're just sick of always seeing the exact same crowd.  if someone gets murdered in or near this place, we'll probably start coming back. until then, we'd rather go to real dive bars, not hipster havens.   during the day is cool, so just go there on a sunday afternoon for $1 pbr with all the local bums and crack addicts getting faced.  also it pisses us off that they keep painting over the art in the bathrooms. mike little's murals were awesome.

we randomly came across this place driving back from encanto park (where we saw a dog obedience school, which was hilarious).  the interior is caked with old-style saloon type stuff (like an entire wagon where all the sauces were located). they have plenty of specialty burgers (but no veggie burgers). also, on the menu, apparently you can buy this place for $1 million.  i had the hawai'ian burger which was awesome. you can eat at the bar (oh, they also have a full bar and video crack), which has free popcorn from one of those old-school popcorn machines. the fried zucchini and the onion rings were really good as well.   i guess they have horseshoe and some other outdoor games in the back, but we didn't have time to check that out. they close way too early.  the cougar at the bar was nice, but could have been nicer.

i like lai lai's a lot, but my lady is not the biggest fan (she says it's not spicy at all, even when she gets extra red chili oil, which is lame, she just said). i don't really like spicy so that's probably why i like this place, because their sweet sauce is pretty awesome.  they have the best noodles that i have found at any mongolian place in the valley. the worker lady is super nice and always acts like she remembers me, which rules. their pineapple is too big, though. it seems impossible to find good pineapple in phoenix.  also, it's a little expensive. and they don't let you take leftovers even if you just get one plate. to-go orders are priced by weight.

we've heard a lot about this place, and finally went there, and it kind of sucked. hardly any sauces, and it's totally ugly inside. also, i'm not sure if the girl working at the front is even old enough to avoid child labor laws.  their pineapple was bad.  lai lai is way better, and so is genghis grill. avoid this place.

we don't know why this place has such a great reputation. it's loaded with hipster douches and assholes with attitudes who all look like lumberjacks.  boring.   it's just not that cool. the oysters are good though. free appetizers for happy hour on sunday. that's pretty much the only time to go. there's also never any place to sit on a busy night. dumb.  it's the shady's of tempe.

Was excited to try this place out since I've lived down the street for a while (I prefer ma and pop dive breakfast places better than any Denny's or a fancy shmancy place always). Super disappointed, wah waaah . They DO have a full bar, while only being opened till 2pm!! I wanna just sit and watch to see who the hell is getting plowed before 2! But, probably not going back. I like cooked food, not WHITE pancakes and sausage patties.

we are a big fan of retro diners and burger shops, and the decor caught our attention, so we decide to try it out. the menu looked promising and the prices weren't bad at all, so we were pretty gosh-darned excited.  however, the food sucked. a lot. i got a teriyaki burger and it was gross. the sauce was lame and the mushrooms were, like, canned or something that you would find at burger king or some other shitpile. my lady got the veggie burger and she said it was just ok. but, it was cold, so that's dumb. also the gravy on the side (which cost 60 annoying cents) looked like poop in cat litter. the fries were good though, so this place gets 2 stars for that and the sweet interior.

so.. i've read many reviews that made my mouth water about this place and have been wanting me some fattoush for a while! so randomly driving by about 2 weeks ago with my dusty  i realized omg "fattoush!" pointing out the window, looked at him and said "i need it!"  the thought of being in falafel heaven, made me happy.. it had been a while since i had good falafel, it didnt let me down. i had the veg plate that came with lentil soup, hummus, a pickle!, dolmas, eggplant mmm so good and of course falafel! they gave us plenty of pita bread which i was thankful for since most the places i have been to give you 1 or 2 thin pieces! and charge you for extras. ugh! i love my bread. thank  you.  we sat near the window next to their cute decorated christmas tree and annoying flies :/ , and watched the rain. other than the flies it was grreat.

there are scarier circle k's, but this one is up there. the gas is usually more expensive than other places because it's right off the 10 (the parking is horrible, too), and the odds are 2:1 that you will be asked for money by a homeless dude or crack addict. i've also been offered a tv for $10 before. so that was pretty weird.  also there is a creepy dungeons-and-dragony/world-of-warcraft type dude that always hangs out and sits on the counter late at night. it's pretty obvious that he thinks he is super cool because of it. he kind of reminds me of the comic book guy from the simpsons except like 10 times more douchey.  the short little security guy always talks really loud whenever people are inside so that they think he's cool and telling jokes (he's not, and he's not).

this pizza hut has the nicest worker who has ever worked at pizza hut. his name is fred and he is awesome. he is usually working at the counter when i pick up my food.  everything else is pretty much what you expect from pizza hut in general.

ok so this place is nothing new to me i have been going here for, i would say 7 years give or take and i am sad to say the changes they have been making are not makin me a happy little pumpkin (?) anyway, i LOVE LOVE LOVE my chips and salsa i mean LOVE. I am sad to say the main reason i went there is to get my "fix", because of their amazing salsa and chip bar, 2 kinds of chips and it USE to be 3 kinds of salsas that they had! i made my very own concoction with 2 salsas they had that i mixed together with lemon juice... the taste was beyond words..MMmmMM..  it hasnt been the same since this happened i am heart broken and am now in search of this new salsa out there waiting for me to love.  other than that this place loves to nickel and dimes the change outta ya. ugh! i dunno why.. every time i go its always packed and am sure that the 50 cents they get for refills or the 5 cents for a to-go cup!! can be easily resolved by giving me my salsa back... well i dont think it would help that situation, but omg! seriously? sad.   dear sylvia's, please make me happy again so i can go and admire your lovely and amazing pictures of clinton and the pope that grace your walls.  thanks,  love always.. me.

the frist experiance here with my dusty was the best hangover cure for me.. blue moon (yay! happy hour) and their caesar salad, their mozzarella and tomato sandwich and yummy fries.   the service was great too, the girl was actually sweetly nice unexpected coming from a hip lookin place like this, it was great. she even made a new salad for me to take home after she accidently threw my salad away when clearing the table.. hah! no biggie. the seats were comfy too yay for pillows!  will be back here soon.

this place blows. the waitress was so horrible, and just stood there and talked to some douches at the bar while we were waiting for her to acknowledge us so we could get beer. i had a burger and it was so messy i actually had to eat it with a fork, and that's weird. it wasn't horrible tasting, i suppose, but still, this place is dumb.  they do have playmakers, though. so, 1 star. we probably won't ever go back.

this is a great burger shop in central phoenix. the fries are excellent, the prices are cheap, the burgers are good (although sometimes they are better than others). and the corndogs taste like god made them, in heaven.  the decor is cool and retro, and not in that overdone, fake way. definitely worth going to if you're in the mood for some cheap burgers that aren't fast food in central phoenix.

this is our favorite bar in phoenix, we usually come a few times  a week. the bartenders are all awesome and they mix our drinks awesomely strong. also, the drinks are totally cheap. also, the karaoke on friday and saturday usually rules.  AND they finally got darts and a pinball machine back, so that's awesome. except, the pinball machine they have is the simpsons, which is super hard to get free games on. they should get addams family or twilight zone.   as far as dive bars go, you can't really top this place: divey, cheap, strong drinks, video crack, pool, darts, pinball, jukebox, karaoke, nice people.

this place kicks mongolian ass. amazing drink specials ALL day, including 1 dollar mimosas. i felt so bad for the poor bartender though, because he only gets the little bottles of champagne, and had to open like 200 of them in 1 day.   also, the food is good. they have tons of ingredients that most mongolian bbq's don't have, like eggs, and curry, and steak, and scallops and potatoes.  they don't have a huge noodle selection though, unfortunately. still, this place is a billion times better than yc.   booze + mongolian = awesome.  i still think it's kind of hilarious that they named a restaurant after one of the most evil people in the history of humanity. where's adolf's pub?  and you can watch jeopardy while you're eating.

we went here after reading a lot of good reviews on yelp, but it didn't live up to all expectations.  i had a hot dog, which was pretty average and had, like, 100x too much mustard. also the onions tasted pretty weird. my lady liked the fries, and was bummed they didn't have any veggie burgers. the inside is pretty cool looking (no room for sitting, just looking, and waiting). there was an inspector of some sort there while we were eating in the back, which raised our brows. the seating in the back is kind of awkward, and right next to the dumpster, so that might explain the flies.  still, the food wasn't horrible, it just didn't live up to all the great reviews this place has.

This place is decent.. Became a staple in when I go out, Old old review (lol) it was real at the time:   i have no idea why this place is getting such great reviews in new-times.  this place blows. we went there expecting to see some of the amazingness that everyone keeps talking about (and for my birthday, too. so that was retarded), but all it was was a bunch of brokers and douches and realtors and businesswomen looking hook up and thinking they were awesome and better than everyone else. i don't think i've ever seen so many pretentious pricks in one place (except maybe at merc bar or any club in scottsdale).  the food wasn't great, but not horrible. the drinks were actually reasonably priced, but the douche-factor made it seem like we were paying top dollar. i guess the place is supposed to be somewhat historic (which is their one selling point, even though pretty much the only original historic piece is the sign painted on the building featured in all their promotional material), but it just seems like they gutted the inside completely and threw the history away -- building a "new" dwelling place for fakey scottsdale cougars with spray-on tans looking to score with random 36-year-old investor douchebags bragging about making their first "mil".   the overpriced, snotty furniture was in my face like a big disgrace and when I came home, my mom got scared, and said you're moving with your auntie and your uncle in bel-air. I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought, "nah, forget it. yo homes.. to bel-air!" I...pulled...up to the house at about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabby "yo homes, smell ya later!" I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there -- to settle my throne as the prince of bel-air.

My pops swears by this place! The best local central Phoenix spot for something fast, easy and delicious. Especially for breakfast. The owner carol is always on hand to make sure everything is perfect which speaks a lot for place.
