We ate there during AZ restaurant week, 3 course $30.  We chose Deseo after trying them at Phoenix Cooks.    The standouts were  the Pandebono(Columbian Cheese Bread)  we liked it so much I  had the waitress write the name down so I could figure out how to make it.  The shrimp ceviche- I wanted to drink the tomato sofrito when I was done.  The Achiote  Chimichurri  with the beef tenderloin had so many layers of flavor; I've never had anything like it.  The huitlacoche fritters served with the jidory chicken made me a fan of huitlacoche.  And of course the muddle bar is great for fans of mojitos.   The only thing that was missing was the cancha corn with pork belly we tried at Phoenix Cooks.   We had a great corner table.  The decor was a little lacking, however service was extraordinary.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the ingredients used and gave us the feeling she wanted us to have a fantastic meal.  Definetly the best meal we have had in Arizona.

I lived in Texas for four years, so I guess you can say I know good BBQ.  This is not fancy gourmet BBQ, to me this is the real, home cooked BBQ I grew up on in the midwest and so lovingly adored in Texas.  Stacy's gives you that eating in your backyard kind of feel.  No fancy decorations, no fussy frills,  and yes there are DO NOT signs everywhere, but think of it as your momma's house you know the rules there so there doesn't need to be signs.   The BEST BBQ outside of Texas and my momma's house.   Bring Cash, ask for the sandwiches with the sauce on the side and prepare to  enjoy the sauce dripping from your chin experience.

If you like trying unusual flavors this is the place for you.  Their Bacon Ice Cream is amazing.  I also tried the Cheese Course Duo(Blue cheese and medjool dates).  The staff was great encouraging us to try as many as we wanted to.  The only bad part is there isn't a location in the West Valley. I'll just have to make a weekend drive to try their Avocado-Jalepeno.

I'm a self proclaimed hot dog lover and if you are too Nogales is the place for you.  I've never had a sonoran hot dog before, so I have to admit I have nothing to compare to.  But, WOW I am now a fan.  Who would think mayonnaise and bacon on a hot dog sounds good, maybe that's the reason it took me 2 years of living in AZ before I ventured out to try one of  these local favorites.  The price $2.75 is great and talk about the toppings to choose from- onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, cojita cheese, cheddar cheese, guacamole, salsa verde, and mayonnaise all on top of that yummy bacon wrapped grilled hot dog.  My only regret is that I didn't order 2.   I've found since my first trip there I've been looking for reasons to be at Keyboard City at 6pm.   Definetly a must try for the hot dog lover or that foodie who's looking for something new to try.  Check out the picture and I dare you not to run to your car to get yourself one tonight.

We decided to eat here for our 4th anniversary dinner.  Let's start with the positives.  Beautiful decor, love the contemporary feel with the chalk blackboard  wall. Great location, the Camelback Inn is very beautiful.  The meal began with the chef's gift of  warm chicken liver spread with thyme and crusty bread - wonderfu,l followed by  the gruyere glazed popover served with a ramekin of european butter and sea salt.-amazing!  A little recipe card is included with the popovers-nice touch.   I wish I had more positives to say I really wanted to love this restaurant.  So now for the reasons for the 2 star rating.    When we arrived for our reservation, it would have been nice to have heard happy anniversary since we had noted that on our open table reservation.We were  seated in a great round booth nice intimate location for our anniversary dinner. When we arrived at our booth she  pulled the table out so we could snuggle in the back and on the seat was food.  Thankfully she noticed and I thought she would apologize and promptly clean up. What happened next should have been a warning sign of how our night was going to turn out.  She said, "Oh" and stood there, so I said "here I'll move so you can clean that off.  She then proceeded to enter the booth and swipe the food off the seat onto the floor with her hand.  Not what I'd expect of a Laurent Tourondel restaurant. Our server arrived  promptly but still no happy anniversary.  I don't mean to make a big deal out of the lack of a greeting, it's just  a nice touch when celebrating a special occasion, definitely not a reason to give a 2 star rating though , so I'll continue.   We ordered our wine and to our surprise our server returned promptly and to our relief wished us Happy Anniversary, which quickly turned awkward as he tried to connect with us and tell us all of his friends are starting to marry and have children and now his girlfriend is looking at him wondering what his problem is that he hasn't asked her to marry him yet and how wow thats a lot of responsibility and he didn't know how people could get married blah blah blah. Thanks, you could've kept your happy anniversary.  Awkward and uncomfortable!  He then proceeded to tell us that the wine we ordered was not chilled enough and would we mind if he chilled it for 6-10 minutes.  Really, how could the wine not be chilled if it's on the menu.  Still ok at this point, we aren't high maintenace diners and honestly pretty easy going and very forgiving.  We thought at this point he would take our orders, however even though we were only 1 or 3 tables filled in the restaurant he did not return to take our order until our wine was chilled.  What he did do was help the table next to ours get that perfect photo for their memory album and blind us with the flash of their camera several times cause they weren't quite happy with their photo.  To his credit he did apologize when he returned to take our order.    I ordered the spice rubbed cowboy ribeye, my husband the bone in rib eye, a side of the creamed spinach, jalapeno mash, and hen of the woods mushrooms with a side of chimichuri and green peppercorn sauce.   The cowboy ribeye comes to the table with the whole rib attached to the ribeye not expecting that. The spices were so charred the only flavor I got was burnt and the meat itself was so fatty half the steak was totally inedible. My husband kindly shared his steak which was good, but hardly anything I would return for.  Great hen of the woods mushrooms really enjoyed these  favorite part of the dinner.  The rest of the sides ok nothing great though.   We finished and my husband had to refill his own wine glass, because our server was chatting and taking pictures again.    What happened next was truly shocking, something I'd expect if we were at Mcdonalds  but not a upscale steakhouse.  An electrician showed up and proceeded to change the light bulb that was out at the booth next to ours.  Mind you by this time it was 10:30 pm and the restaurant closed at 11pm.  Really are you freaking kidding me you can't wait a half hour to change a light bulb.    To BLT'S credit they arrived  with a complimentary dessert, however as the wait staff, not our server sets it down in front of us and promptly walks away without explaining what it was we looked down and in fittingly comic horror scribbled on the plate is Happy Birthday!  WOW!! Our server shows to drop off the check and looks at the plate and says" did they write happy birthday?  haha that's funny"  Really BLT!  We trusted the reputation of Laurent Tourondel to schedule our special occasion and this was very amateur and embarrassing for your restaurant  at best.  When you go out to dinner and willing fork out over $200 for a meal this is not what is expected.   I guess my husband and I should thank BLT for giving us such a  great story to tell all of our friends and family of the night we wasted over $200 on a comical night of amateur proportion.

I really wanted to give them a better rating because they have great toppings. Service was great, cute little restaurant, beer flights and wine flights, but the pizza dough was just ok.  Wasn't expecting the dough to be so "doughy". I was looking for that crisp dough you get at a wood fire oven place.   I've been searching long and hard for that pizza place with an egg pizza to remind me of the pizza's I had in Italy.   Just have to say great toppings, but work on the dough.

I had the brie and carmelized onion quesadilla and my husband had the calcutta egg roll.  Can't wait to try everything on the menu.   Ana was our server for our early saturday morning bruch.  When I first saw the small space and fold out chairs, I worried I had made a wrong choice, but when the food arrived we were blown away.  Never would have expected such depth in flavor.  Ana took the time to come out and answer questions about ingredients used and even went back to the kitchen to bring us the jar of an ingredient we'd never heard of.   Great place, amazing food.  I only wish I could have a calcutta egg roll everyday.

Amazing! We went there for Sunday Morning Brunch.  I had the Quiche with tomato coulis and Justin had  the Croque Monsieur with mornay sauce.   We also had  the beignets with a red wine reduction.  The sauces are amazing.   Love how they decorated see my attached pictures.  The space is so warm and cozy and the staff was amazing.  Chef even came out of the kitchen to welcome us and talk to us about the food.  Their outdoor dining area has a fireplace and looks very inviting now that outdoor dining in AZ is here.   Can't wait to go back for dinner.  Everyone has to eat here and plan to stay and hang out for awhile in this new little cozy restaurant.

Can't wait for next year when they work out all the "first timer" mistakes.  Great festival, great fun!  Next year may i suggest buy your tickets early and online like I did. Walked right in and just started having fun.  We showed up at 4:30 and left at 8:00 and we got to try everything.  We only had to wait in 2 long lines and that was fun because we got to mingle with our queue neighbors and meet some new people.  Great music and loved that it was a nighttime event.  You'll be seeing me there next year.

Great Food, Great Service and Great Atmosphere. We had the pork belly grilled cheese with tomato soup, the crab cakes, and the caesar salad.  All very yummy.  They have full bar, great wine list and draft beer and even their own house brewed beer.  Excited Verrado finally has another place to go for dinner. Great variety of food.
