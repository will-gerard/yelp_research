Totally AMAZING pet supply! Wholesale prices to the public and super friendly staff! It's a bit overwhelming the first time you go so expect to spend some time there - you can call to request a catalog or go online to price items since the items in the warehouse are not priced (and yes, they accept credit cards). They are always busy so many times items are missing but they are constantly restocking the shelves. I priced the same items at Petsmart for $220, on Amazon for $125, and paid $85 at Ryan's.

After passing this place on the way to and from work every day for months, I finally caved in and rounded up some peeps for a weekend lunch expedition. This was my first ever experience with Salvadoran food and I was definitely not disappointed! The area is a little shady so we made it a day trip and took about half a dozen people. At first I was a little apprehensive, the area sucks and the parking lot was empty but it was a Saturday and probably between the lunch and dinner rush. In fact, by the time we were ready to leave, the place had filled up. The actual restaurant was very minimalist but clean and welcoming on the inside. The only negative I have to report (other than the neighborhood) is the language barrier and lack of service. Don't get me wrong, the server was very sweet and accommodating but there was only one, she didn't understand what we were saying most of the time, and it was hard to flag her down once it started to get busy. Only one of us had any experience with this genre of food, and although he liked Guanaquito, he said he preferred Eliana's but mostly because he said they spoke English and had a slightly better papusa. This was my first so I had nothing to compare it to, but I have to say I was very pleased. We ordered 3 plato tipico which came with papusas (we opted for all bean and cheese after reading the other Yelp reviews), a Salvadorean version of an empenada filled with meat and potatoes, yucca frita, tamales, and some slaw. We all loved it all except half our party passed on the tamales and we all agreed the pickled slaw wasn't the greatest; I would've preferred the slaw to have had more time to develop it's flavors and wilt a bit - it was also very sweet and I like my non-creamy slaws with a little more tang. We also had a side of fried plantains that were accompanied by crema fresca and beans (AWESOME!), their complimentary chips and salsa, and my kids shared the spaghetti with ablondigas. After reading all of the reviews on this place, I had planned on trying their chicken soup but I was so full I had to pass. At the end of the massive lunch we probably dropped about $12 per person, an excellent value for the amount of food we got. My husband (who is totally not an adventurous diner) said it was alright but I'm pretty sure I saw his eyes light up like Christmas when they brought him his Fanta in an old-school glass bottle, lol.

Slay the Dragon! You can request a drink card with every type of beer available and if you try one of each, you get a free shirt, LOL! Me? I stuck to Guinness by the pint and had the Cornish pasty and sausage roll - both delectable but kind of small for the $6 price tag. It's a pub in every essence of the word - they have free darts (that's right, FREE!), a juke box filled with classic rock hits at 25 cents to a dollar per song, and 50 cent billiards! They also host World Series Poker tourneys! The service is super sweet (although they get REALLY busy sometimes) but the joint is really laid back and friendly!

This place is awesome! I came in based on the previous reviews and I wasn't disappointed. My car was sounding like a rice rocket, so I brought it in - turns out two welds had popped off of the exhaust. $20 and 5 minutes later, everything was perfect! Wish I had come in sooner this week and had my brakes done, but at least I know for next time! Plus, if you choose to wait for your car - The Yard is RIGHT NEXT DOOR!

I don't know if their food is good and frankly, I don't care. All I know is that I have NEVER in my life been so appalled at the horrible level of customer service at this location and I'll never go back. I called in my order one night and was told it would be 15 minutes. When I got there (20 minutes later) my order wasn't ready. I waited an extra 15 minutes before asking how long it would be. When the cashier turned around to find our how much longer, the ex-con looking a*hole of a fry cook in the back shouted some obscenities at me, called me a liar about how long I had been waiting, and that was pretty much all I needed to hear before demanding a refund and walking out the door. Long Wong's can suck a fatty; personally I wish that nasty eyesore had stayed closed.

I am sad that this is the only baking superstore in my vicinity. Perhaps if this store were located among the many craft and culinary boutiques in the heart of Stepford (aka the East Valley), it would not be so highly rated and flocked to in throngs. I've only attempted to shop here thrice but each time I have been unable to find any of the things I had been looking for. I felt snubbed by the baking ladies who'd rather cackle amongst themselves about whose cardiologist was potentially worse than help a customer find a product. Instead I blindly searched and was waved off to an area where the items "might be" and when happening upon an "out of stock" label on a lonely shelf, was offered no further assistance on how I might acquire said missing item in the future. I left the bakery as I had come in, without a greeting and without notice. It's a shame this place blows so badly because it does smell amazing!

This location is the sole reason that after 13 years, we are no longer AirTouch/Verizon customers, and will never, ever be again. I went in to upgrade my phones one afternoon only to be accosted by an angry, pimply faced little elf of an employee. He was disrespectful, got in my face, and talked down to me the entire time when all I had wanted was two new phones. When I got sick of his attitude I demanded a manager and he said there wasn't one. As if. He then called security, which is when I REALLY got mad! I began yelling at the top of my lungs when "magically" a manager appeared out of the back room to investigate the commotion. The manager sent the kid on a "walk" and apologized profusely, saying they've had problems with him before. My question was: WHY THE HELL DOES HE STILL WORK THERE?!?! He asked what he could do to make us happy and I asked for the regional manager's phone number. He provided the regional manager's cellular number, which I promptly called. After explaining what had happened, both managers agreed to cancel our two accounts with no early cancellation fees. Woot.

I said Gasper's, he said Teakwoods. I said Lenny's, he said Serrano's. I said Spasso, we ended up at Chili's. W.T.F... So yeah, I gave them 2 stars because DAMN, I love their chips - but WOW, this place sucks. The service is pleasant but terribly scarce and the food - dear baby Jesus, where do I begin. The cheese on top of the spinach dip was one solid mass (tasty, but seeing how only one of us got any cheese - so gypped!), the southwestern eggrolls burned the skin off the roof of my mouth, and the boneless wings were sauceless and cold. My burger was ICE COLD and the "crispy" onion strings were one soggy, undercooked mass. My husband got a burger which lacked both the chipotle ranch and jalape√±os that had been advertised in the menu and my oldest had the Kraft Mac, which was dried up around the edges and included a hair. How the heck do you f up Kraft?! Of course no night is complete without the dick in the corner booth with his hideous she-beast wife and three dopey ass looking boys making comments about keeping my hyper daughters under control. Like it's my fault you're only into young boys. Thank goodness for Yelp - at least next time I lose all sensibility and agree to Chili's, I can pull up this review and remember exactly why I only end up here once a decade.

Got a smokin' deal on a Brazilian Blowout for $69 via Phoenix New Times VOICE Daily Deals and was rewarded with a voucher for a free massage, facial, or mani/pedi when I actually went in for my blowout with Chris! Also had high quality eyelash extensions done by Nia for WAY cheaper than what most valley salons charge! Absolutely love the staff and will be back soon for my deep tissue massage and rock star pedicure! :)

In the service industry, it's difficult to come across truly trustworthy businesses. I get that everyone in the world is in it to make a buck, but I'm so glad that some businesses value honesty above profiteering, especially because they're intelligent enough to realize that when they treat their customers like people, and not dollar signs, the money will come.   I've had the pleasure of bringing my two vehicles to Bill on three separate occasions. Each time he told me the TRUTH. The first time he told me there wasn't anything wrong with the car and he didn't try to charge me for an unnecessary diagnostic. The second time he told me he was just too busy and that it would be a few days until he could get to my car. He even let me call him over the phone to make sure my dealership wasn't screwing me over on the repair he wasn't able to get to. The third time he told me someone else who specializes in that service could do the job quicker and cheaper than him.   Honesty: that's what keeps me coming back!

I don't typically review fast food chains but this location just asked for it. I wish I could give one star for this sorry excuse for a fried chicken chain. Not only do they have the WORST customer service ever (well, okay maybe not ever - I think Long Wong's MIGHT still have a slight edge) but they always forget the jalape√±os. I mean, ALWAYS. Why is that?!?! And be warned - in this digital age, this company is a dying breed. They absolutely WILL NOT accept digital coupons, it MUST be in paper with NO exceptions. Even when the digital coupons have a coupon code printed in bright red on the top left hand corner and no barcode. Apparently their staff isn't bright enough to tip-tap-type these codes into the magical box of buttons and numbers to make the coupon effective. LAME. After my now second horrible experience at this Church's location, I'm Popeye's 4 LIFE!

Too bad there's not an option for no stars. The only thing more atrocious than the fungal smell and lack of working equipment at this gym is the customer service. Today I cancelled my entire family's membership because I've had enough. After touring three other local gyms - I'm willing to pay the extra money to switch to one that gives a crap about its customers. Having had my membership for 11 years it's a sad move, especially since I pay peanuts - but it's just NOT worth the headache of working out here. When the manager accused me of lying about my child's age, I went back home and brought back her birth certificate to prove I wasn't lying, and still I remained a customer. When the manager bitched at me about not answering the overhead page when it CLEARLY states on the app (in permanent marker) that they MUST call me on my cellular because I am hard of hearing and I run plugged into my iPhone, I stayed a member. Now they're saying I haven't paid up my account even though I have a RECEIPT in my possession from last week, when I paid in person. If this is how they treat loyalty, I'd hate to see how they piss on everyone else. Take my advice - pay the extra few bucks and switch to Gold's, LA, or ANYWHERE else.

La Salsita is infinitely better than the Filiberto's across the street. The drive-thru takes about twice as much time to get through, but this is because they make FRESH FOOD. Real handmade corn tortillas, flour tortilla, AND chips, fried to order! Plus, their carne asada is ACTUALLY SEASONED! The best thing? CHILAQUILES! I haven't had anything here that I didn't love! I'm going to try the seafood specials someday, but I just haven't worked up the courage to order un-fried seafood through a talking metal box.

12 hours before my flight, my Boxer jumped through a plate glass window and ended up with a bad laceration on her front leg. At my sister's suggestion, I drove to her vet (Dr. Cruz) and arrived 15 minutes before closing time. Not only did he take his time with us, he offered to keep my baby all weekend because he knew I had to fly out first thing in the morning. His prices were upfront and competitive, and he took great care of my princess for the entire 4 days I was gone. I appreciated that he didn't rush us, and even more appreciative that he didn't "price gouge" us for emergency services. He even tried to find us the cheapest route possible by bundling services and providing discounts. Dr. Cruz was just amazing, and I will definitely be returning with all of my pets!

Every time I come here I always tell myself NEXT TIME I'm only ordering black bean soup, tapas, and the guava pasteles! Then the selective amnesia sets in...   Enter Groupon. So last weekend I couldn't pass up the Havana Cafe Groupon - Groupons always make me feel just a little bit better about dining out on overpriced Cuban, or any overpriced food/service in general. The one I purchased was for something called "completas" - complete family meals to-go for 4, normally priced at $39.95 but going for $20 through Groupon. When I was a kid I lived next door to this Cuban family in LA and I fondly remembered the tower of styrofoam containers filled with black beans, pollo con arroz, plantains, and bread that often accompanied the Sera family when they paid us visits. I was excited so I gave it a shot. At $20, what could it hurt?  The lady on the phone was very nice. She took the order, asked if I'd like to upgrade the col salad (like a citrus slaw) to a mista salad (mixed greens) for $2.50 more. I declined. I went with the paradise pulled pork with moros and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert. It was ready in 15 minutes. I went to pay and there was some confusion about the value of the Groupon but it was honored in full and I was charged about $3.77 for the tax. I got home only to find that the Cuban bread had been left out. Major bummer! As for the meal - the portions were probably enough to fill 2 adults, assuming they ate every last bite, but the moros, pork, and plantains were all sensational! The col salad I could probably have done without but the chocolate bread pudding was just AH-MAHZING!   All in all I'd probably skip the completas next time, unless I had the Groupon again, but I'd definitely come back for black bean soup, tapas, and dessert!

It's not the greatest Chinese food in the country but for Arizona, it's definitely one of the best! I'd say the food is worth a good 4 stars but the friendly owners and the amazing wait staff make this a five star joint! I love the egg foo young, pepper steak, the chicken fruit salad, and pan fried noodles. My husband, who suffers from severe white guy syndrome, prefers the cream cheese wontons, lemon chicken, and sizzling rice soup. I never call in my take-out orders, I just walk in and within 10 minutes it's usually ready to go, no matter how big the order is! I wish they were open Sundays but the owner says if she didn't close at least one day a week she'd never get her husband out of the kitchen, lol!

After unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking "Sundrops" nail salon with my two year old in tow, I was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled Andy's Nails. I Yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so I walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces I've seen in a while. Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter, they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless, one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes!  Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other Arcadia/Biltmore/Camelback Corridor nail salons AND they're cheaper by anywhere from $5-$20! I'm definitely going back and going back soon! My toes are lonely...

I've been in health care for a decade and THIS is the only pediatrician office I know of that is open 6 days a week year round and 7 days a week during the cold/flu season! Not only was my kid's appointment honored ON TIME but I was in and out in half an hour! Oh, AND the doctors are really nice! :)

So, food is probably only 3 stars (lots of hits and lots of misses), but HOLY COW, the service is 5 stars on its own, which is how I arrived at this 4 star split. We arrived for an early dinner during Restaurant Week and were promptly greeted by a gaggle of friendly staffers at the entrance. After being seated in probably the nicest leather booth in all of Arizona, we ordered beverages - right off the bat, go for the Brown Cow Stockyard Rootbeer that they have on draft. It comes in a frosty mug with no ice. At about $3.50 a pop, there are no free refills, but it's well worth the two you'll probably down for $7 during dinner!    Next came the basket of fresh biscuits, cornbread, and sweet butter. DELISH! This was accompanied by a sizable dish of super fresh crudites. Also DELISH! But then came the Mushroom Rockefeller appetizer, which was a mild disappointment. Four fresh, large mushroom caps stuffed with spinach and bacon, topped with cheese and then baked. Pretty simple - except they were unintentionally served cold. You couldn't taste the bacon either, and the cheese had coagulated on top, making for a weird combination of consistencies in my mouth. By weird, I mean not good. The best part of the plate was the mess of sauteed spinach and garlic sitting as a garnish in the middle. THAT was so delicious - I saved it on a side plate to eat with my entree.   First up on the Restaurant Week menu was a choice of salad. I ordered a Caesar. I loved the dressing, the cheese, the crouton, and the presentation, but the lettuce was brown. Like, really brown. I was pretty disappointed about that too.  Second, the 12 ounce ribeye with whiskey peppercorn sauce and parmesan potato stack. The ribeye was pretty thin, but flavorful and cooked to my medium rare liking. I sort of expected the Walmart guy to pop out and yell, "THIS IS A STEAKOVER!" It never happened. I would assume that the 16 ounce on the regular menu is of the thickness I prefer in my ribeyes; 12 ounces was just too thin to enjoy medium rare.    My ribeye was also missing the whiskey peppercorn sauce, but that was quickly remedied. The sauce was more like a gravy. I really couldn't tell where the whiskey or the peppercorn was, but it added a nice dimension to the meat that I thought had been lacking in my first dry bite. My potato stack was also tasty - a bit old school and on the salty side, but good considering it was real au gratin potatoes. My husband definitely preferred my stack to his mash.   The end of the meal was the real superstar. Pecan pie. Topped with bourbon infused whipped cream. Wow. I can't even justify this dessert with a description; it was just that good.   The place is a historic gem, the staff is incredible friendly, and bless our server Justine - she was a real trooper. They get extra points for a $5 kids menu that includes a drink and dessert. I think next time I'll just jump right to the root beer, prime rib, and pecan pie - but trust me, there definitely will be a next time!

Used to love this place with the good food and amazing views but the service truly sucks now. We waited nearly 30 minutes before I finally flagged a waitress down to find out who our server was - she simply sneered and said "well it's not me honey!" That was enough for us to leave and never return. Too bad, I kind of miss the place.

When I was a kid I had this awful dentist who looked like an Asian Frankenstein's monster and would always click his tongue at me disapprovingly as he did my cleanings; he always made me feel like I was a bad person for getting cavities and making him actually work. Not the case at Lakeview! The staff is extremely non-judgmental and so friendly! They even include a complimentary paraffin hand wax with cleanings! Until I met Dr. Arooni I always thought it was normal that the doctor had to inject you 4-5 times around each tooth before beginning work; who knew that it really only takes one good shot to the nerve to remove two wisdom teeth totally painlessly?!?! I sure didn't! My family and I have been patients at Lakeview for almost 7 years and we love them so much that we followed them from Scottsdale to Chandler, even though it's about 30 minutes out of our way. Trust me, I'm not usually a fan of dentists but they're awesome!

The pizza that made Walter White's roof famous. Easy ordering online or by mobile phone! Check the coupons for codes to enter at checkout. The delivery guy arrived at the Arizona Grand Resort within the 50 minute time limit stated on the website. Food was hot, bubbly, and delicious. I liked the crust even though it got a little soggy in the middle underneath all of the toppings. The cheese coagulates a little too quickly, but if you eat it while it's hot, it's pretty terrific. The thing about this pizza that had me sailing over the edge was the pizza sauce. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Garlicky, tomato basil - perfectly seasoned - I couldn't get enough. I over ordered and we didn't have a fridge so by the end of the night I was just peeling the cold cheese off and eating the crust with the sauce. They didn't provide any utensils, paper plates, napkins, or Parmesan cheese/crushed red peppers. I'm guessing I should have asked, but Stumpy's up near the Hilton Squaw Peak totally anticipated our needs when delivering to the hotel - I guess I just assumed Venezia's would too? Either way, I'd totally eat here again! And if you're staying at the Arizona Grand, ordering in is way tastier and cheaper than going the room service route.

All you need is a jug of their secret recipe salsa, a large Joanne special cheese crisp, and the Gollo burro wet with green sauce. The service is sometimes sparse when it gets busy because they usually only have one or two waitresses running at any given time, but they are all amazingly friendly and always make us feel just like family! Your patience is always rewarded with delicious family recipes that you can't find anywhere else in this state and if you give them the chance, they'll make a lifelong fan out of you too!

I don't know what people are bitching about. I'm not quite sure what about this place would ever even imply that it was a classy 5 star joint, but seriously, let's face it, you can so totally tell by its outward appearance and menu that it's not. What it is is a great place to get a fresh made sandwich in grab and go time at a decent price. You can also order for delivery or pick up, and the pick ups even have their own designated window outside, which is pretty sweet if you hit the lunch rush.  I haven't had a sandwich here is didn't like. Then again, I've only had two... A friend of mine that I like to call the Matador let me in on the little not so secret Old Station secret of the daily special for just under $8. Today was Ham & Cheese - which I personally think is the best sammy here. For $7.35 plus tax you get a 10 inch chewy white hoagie stuffed with thin sliced ham and swiss with all of the fixins, a side of crack-like potato salad (or slaw or macaroni salad), and a 16oz beverage.   Yeah - so they don't serve watercress soup and lightly dressed micro greens on fresh pressed white linens, but they do make tasty sandwiches quickly and for pretty cheap. And while I may or may not have once found a hair in my sandwich wrapper, I won't hold it against them. That's how much I love their ham and cheese on white and their potato salad...

Come for dinner. Just do it. So, we were informed that the dinner chef at La Pi√±ata is the same chef at Mi Patio during the day. With that said, he must be a one magical being, because his food is consistently delicious across the board no matter what restaurant you catch him at. I had the taco, enchilada, and green corn tamale plate. Everything on the plate was incredible - even the beans. I was too full to eat my rice, but the consensus at the table was that it was the only part of the meal that was mildly unsatisfactory, as it was a bit salty. On a side note - my husband had the Pi√±ata Chimi and wasn't very happy either. The waiter had warned him that the regular green or red chili chimis were actually a better choice, but as usual, he didn't listen.   I also did not partake in the margaritas of pi√±ata fame, but my sister claims that she had imbibed many a night and that these margaritas, they are top notch. My kids were also raving all night about the french fries and tortilla soup, and my kids know french fries and tortilla soup - so I'd just take their word for it. The service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating with some of our special needs. Overall, a GREAT experience and we will definitely be back!

Love, love, love this place! Definitely going to be my new local go-to for bathing suits in the future! I usually shop at Everything But Water but it seemed so far away and I usually have disdain for absolutely every minute of the experience, the drive didn't seem worth it. Enter WHAT WOMEN WANT. For the first time in my adult life since having children, I can actually say I ENJOYED shopping for a bathing suit! The ladies here were absolutely wonderful with their opinions and were a great help in locating a great selection of suits in the right fit for my body type. For the price of a single bikini at EBW, I was able to find two flattering tankini tops and a super cute bottom to match both. Also got to browse their great sundress selection and even got a killer recommendation for dinner - so thanks so much ladies!

It's my favorite Chinese joint in Tempe. I mean, the first time I walked in the owner snatched the regular menu out of my hand and placed a completely different menu in my hand as he whispered: "THIS is the menu you want." Any place that boasts a separate "American" menu from a more authentic "Chinese" menu has got to be legit. I've sampled the goods from both menus and frankly, I'm in love. It's not LA Chinese food, but for Arizona, it's tasty, it's cheap, and I'm content.  I've had the Westlake Beef Soup, which is good except they add imitation crab meat. I think that's weird, but it didn't bother me enough to stop eating it. I saw that they had Creamy Chicken Corn Chowder and Sizzling Rice Soup on the menu and those are definitely on my list of soups I plan to try in the future. The basic apps of Fried Wontons, Eggrolls, and Paper Wrapped Chicken are fine - but I have yet to meet a Chinese restaurant in Arizona that screws up those basics. I had Szechuan Dumplings on my last visit. These steamed wontons are served in a sweet and spicy sauce of chilies, mushrooms, jalape√±os, and ginger. Sweeter than I prefer, but again - not bad. I love the Pan Fried Dumplings. Although China Magic Noodle House serves my favorite pan fried dumplings -- Wong's boasts serving my second favorite. They are doughy so if you're not a chewy potsticker fan, beware. I love that these are chewy, meaty, and served with a thicker sweet dipping sauce. My kids stick to the Chow Mein and love it, but my favorite noodle dish is the Sizzling Pan Fried Noodles. An explosion of veggies and meat with pan fried chow mein noodles in a brown sauce. My go-to dishes are the House Special Chicken and Salt and Pepper Pork but I've been told the Wong Jo Chicken is the business. Guess I'll have to wait until next visit for that adventure!  A word or two of wisdom: if you plan on doing take out and ordering the pan fried dumplings - they'll take AT LEAST 20 minutes so don't be afraid to run next door and grab a drink at Baseline Pub with my two favorite lady bartenders while you wait!

Nasty, nasty, nasty, and gross. The cheese crisp is anything BUT (greasy, limp, UGH) and the chips are STALE and vary between super chewy and/or break my jaw status - when I tried to ask for fresh chips the waiter looked right in my eye, apologized, and said he'd promptly throw them back into the microwave for me... WHA?!?! This restaurant is proof that George W. Bush was a bigger idiot than we ever gave him credit for (for those of you who have never been - the TeePee claim to fame is being a local fave of the Bush). I recommend avoiding this place completely and trying Carolina's, Los Compadres, or Casa Reynoso. Service is hit or miss so if you MUST go - try the shredded beef tacos, skip the tap water, and sit at the bar.

Great pizza - I always add garlic which makes every pizza even more AWESOME! I prefer to order carry out - sometimes the delivery takes too long when they get busy and you end up with cold pizza, which still tastes great (and not rubbery like those places that use cheap imitation cheese blends) but when you order fresh pizza, eating it hot is just sort of an expectation! If you keep your eyes peeled you can usually find killer deals in the coupon mailer, the Arcadian, and even on Groupon!

I love this little European gem in the Mexican ghetto! I recommend stopping in early though if you're in the market for fresh baked pretzels because they often run out long before mid afternoon. They sell Haribo gummy sweets, Rittersport and Milka chocolate bars, as well as fresh strudel, and jarred lingonberries! If you come too late for pretzels, ask for the horseshoes or buns, they're just as tasty but smaller. As for an earlier review from someone complaining that the lack of cars in the lot was an indicator of what to expect from the business - I wonder if they actually set foot inside because maybe then they'd realize it is just a bakery/mini-mart, not a sit-down establishment, hence no need to park and spend the entire day there (although I probably could find a good reason or two to loiter!) I hate that they aren't open Sundays and Mondays because that's when I seem to crave German sweets the most - thank goodness Cost Plus has such a large selection of German chocolates now or else I'd be forced to camp out at the Heidelberg until Tuesday! P.S. The lady who runs the place is neither "mean" nor "moody" just rather stoic...

After today's visit I have decided to upgrade my original review from 4 stars to 5. So today, during my weekly "pretzel run", I purchased a coconut macaroon at the insistence of the lady who runs the shop. She swore it was her favorite thing there and it was just like her father used to make; I mean, who can argue with that?   HOLY BALLS! After just one bite I actually contemplated flipping a bitch in dead stopped traffic and running everyone over at the bus stop just to get another one! First off, this thing is GYNORMOUS! Second, it's totally schizophrenic and I REALLY like that. It's almost as if the macaroon couldn't decide whether it was a cookie or a candy bar so it essentially transmogrified into something of both. It's crispy, chewy, sweet, buttery, chocolatey, and coconutty. If euphoria could come in a spherical yet pointy package, it would be this magnificently decadent macaroon!

The dining room is a tad bit claustrophobic but the food is worth the minor discomfort! I like starting my night off snacking on wine saturated pieces of fruit out of a glass of house sangria and then moving on to some guilt free baked wings. The Fennel Orange Salad is almost as good as the Brussel Sprout Salad at Chelsea's but hands down, my favorite dish at LGO is the Padre (which is no longer on the regular menu but they're still more than happy to make it for you); a pizza with arugula, fig, point reyes blue, and prosciutto di san daniele. My fallback pizza is the Fallen Angel, and even though I'm a die hard carnivore, I've heard plenty of rave reviews from my skinny vegetarian friends about the avocado pizza and the roasted corn pizza. If you're feeling really daring, ask for egg on your pizza! Sounds funny but if you're an egg slut like me you'll find that this might be what has been missing from your pizzas for all your life! And if you don't have time to dine in, you can order take out in the LGO grocery store - I highly recommend taking home a bag of the heavenly homemade English muffins or for a lighter meal, the Stacked Turkey sandwich on a baguette! You really can't go wrong with any choice you make at LGO, or really - at any of their sister restaurants!

Long time Cork N' Cleaver patron, first time Feeney's diner, and from here on out, this is my go-to steakhouse! For those people who miss the Cork (and who knows if they'll ever re-open since the kitchen fire last year) or love meat in general, this should be your ONLY stop for great food and service! It's old school, cozy, friendly, and phenomenally delicious! At first glance the place looks a little shady - like a neighborhood Irish pub your dad might hang out in. We almost missed the parking lot and when we saw the "saganaki", "escargot", and "spanakopita" on the menu I was a little weirded out but weird menu items and ancient decor aside, the staff is incredibly attentive and the prices just can't be BEAT! I mean, I don't know who else in this county serves quality 14oz slabs of New York strip or prime rib with all of the fixin's (including a FRESH all-you-can eat salad bar and bread) for only $27, and the mozzarella sticks? FUGHEDDABOUTIT!  Well, don't really because they are AWESOME! Feeney's has my heart and a customer for LIFE! My only regret is that I've lived here 7 years and am JUST visiting for the first time! What the heck?!

The escalators are always broken, the popcorn is reminiscent of stale ass, the floors are sticky, and their customer service is a joke! I took both my kids to the FIRST showing of a CHILDREN'S movie on a Sunday morning during one of the hottest days of the year. The theater was 2/3 empty and we sat up front - about 30 minutes in my little one got antsy so my husband took her out to the arcade area. He tried to bring her back in but was told he couldn't by one of the employees. He decided to wait out the movie in the lobby after being given a refund on his ticket in arcade tokens (WTF?), but was then told he had to leave the premises because my child was being too loud (she was squealing at the games). When he asked them to exchange his game tokens for cash and then told them I had the car keys, wallet, and cell phones, they basically told him too bad and told him he had to wait out the 45 minutes in 100+ degree heat with my small child! If I hadn't thought it was strange that he hadn't returned and gone to see what had happened, I never would have known. We asked for the manager immediately and after my husband pointed out the two girls who had asked him to exit the building, we watched completely appalled as they lied to the manager, saying they had never even seen my husband before and that they had never told him anything like that. To our utter shock she basically turned to us and called US liars, refusing to give a refund. When we asked to speak to a general manager, he wasn't available but called us later in the day. He apologized and said he believed us but had to "back" his managers despite his personal belief. Worst theater experience ever - now we make the extra 30 minute drive up to Cine Capri; Harkins is SO much better AND they have flavored popcorn!

Wow.   So the food was pretty good; nothing SLAP-TASTIC-BLOW-YOUR-MIND-INSANE, but a solid 4 stars. Upon entering the restaurant, half of it was closed down, which was a little disappointing, but tolerable. I was allowed to duck under the chain and explore the back half of the restaurant, which was pretty cool. The employees were cleaning, and the initial welcome was pleasant.   However, the events that followed are what really impressed me about Lenny's. I watched as an old man verbally accosted a young man at the register for nearly ten minutes, regarding the outrageous price of milk shakes (which I'm pretty sure the employees have no control over). This young man handled himself with a level of decorum that is probably lacking in most boys his age. It was just impressive beyond words. I was so pleasantly surprised by the level of service provided to us and in the face of this elderly tyrant, I just felt it necessary to write this review to acknowledge the young man who helped us. I don't believe I caught his name, but he was so patient, informative, and kind - his pleasant attitude matched the nostalgia oriented decor, and made me long for the days when I was a child, and customer service actually meant you cared.   The food was delicious in its own right and insured that I would be a repeat customer, but the service just made me a customer for life.

I've now hired both professional tile installers and tile installers off of Craigslist, and I can honestly say that using Arizona Floors was worth the extra bit of money. Dennis was GREAT. He helped us pick something affordable from his showroom, showed up as scheduled to do the measurements, and had a guy here on time and ready to work today! And I couldn't be happier with the finished product! I was a little worried when I was given a written quote and then received a call a few days later stating that the price would be slightly higher due to a minor oversight involving the cost reseating of two toilets. I wasn't exactly thrilled - the written quote had come in way under my expectations and the new quote was a bit higher than I had planned for. In the end, I stayed with Arizona Floors, and I'm thrilled with what they've done!

I was excited. I mean REALLY excited. 17 (SEVENTEEN!!!) positive reviews with the only complaint being that the prices were "a little high"??? I was ECSTATIC. I loved my first plumber but after several years of faithful service he moved away to become a law enforcement officer and we couldn't be happier for him. My second plumber I loved as well. Unfortunately he was only plumbing his way through graduate school and once graduation came and went, we lost him too - but once again, super proud of him. It has been nearly three years since we've needed plumbing services so I guess I consider myself pretty lucky.   Unfortunately, that lucky streak ended last night when the kitchen pipes sprung a massive leak. I jumped on Yelp and searched for plumbers in my area. When I saw that Sav-On was a Yelp advertiser and highly rated, I jumped onto the phone and made an appointment. (Tom?) seemed really nice on the phone. He said he couldn't get out tonight but that he would come the next day at 3 or 4pm. I told him I had class until 3pm so he said he'd be by between 4 and 4:30pm. I said that would be very convenient for me and made the date.   Cut to this afternoon. I rushed home after class and waited. And waited. And waited. 4pm rolled by. Then 4:30. My husband called and was told someone would call us right back. 5pm and nothing. I called them and Tom said that because my husband gave the wrong name on the appointment they didn't know who we were. Okay, so I will place HALF the blame on my husband, BUT since he gave them a functional return number, I would assume that the proper etiquette would have been to return the call to say that they didn't have us scheduled for a call. Tom apologized and said it was his fault for not double checking the address with his technician. I said everything was legit and I would just love an ETA, as it was getting late. We hung up. And I waited. And waited. Between 5:30pm and 6:30pm I called Tom an additional FOUR times only to be greeted by Tom's voicemail. At 7pm I decided it was time to call another company.   It is now 7:30pm. Three and a half hours without even a COURTESY CALL or an APOLOGY or an UPDATE is unacceptable. I am now calling Diamondback Plumbing and Parker and Sons, so hopefully between the two of them I can find a real keeper. You would think in a recession, people would be thrilled for work - apparently good customer service continues to elude service people even in the worst of times. It truly is a damned shame because I really did want to like these guys - my only regrets (other than not getting to review them on their service and prices) are that I STILL can't use my stupid kitchen, and I can't assign a lower score than one star. Boo, Sav-on - seriously BOO.

Stumbled across this gem while I had 20 minutes to kill waiting for pan fried dumplings to go from Wong's next door. I figured that a place that boasts a 10am to 7pm Happy Hour can't be all bad, so I took a chance.   I walked in. It was dark. A dozen or so heads whipped around and I realized that other than the bartender, I was the only female in the joint on a weekday afternoon. But as soon as I sat at the bar, my doubts melted away over an ice cold draft beer and friendly conversation with one of my now two most favorite bartenders on the planet.   The beer is cold and cheap, the staff is friendly, and the patrons aren't douchebags. Mostly. I imagine when Toby Keith sang: "It's my kind of place; Just walkin' through the front door, puts a big smile on my face; It ain't too far, come as you are - I love this bar" he was singing about a place just like Baseline Pub.

By far my favorite Thai place in Arizona! I know this doesn't mean much by culinary standards because HEY, we're in Arizona - BUT, with that said, this is the place you want to be. My only wish is that the portions were larger. Coming by authentic Asian cuisine is difficult enough in this part of the world and when you find a good place, boy do they make you pay for it! I took a cue from my favorite local food blogger, Seth Chadwick, and ordered the spicy garlic chicken and spicy egg bomb. For egg sluts like me, the latter was HEAVEN! We also went with the tom kha gai soup which was an EXCELLENT choice and the best I've had out here. It's a bit of a drive from my Arcadia but well worth the trip!

Boo. I have to admit that being a former waitress, I have NEVER not left a tip - even when the service has been borderline atrocious. I didn't really have a problem this time. So, the restaurant itself is nice enough. A man who spoke little English took our drink orders, and we thought he was our waiter so we asked him to make sure he split the checks. He gave us an annoyed look and brushed off the request, demanding that we hurry and order beverages. 20 minutes later a woman came out and once again, rushed us into ordering. We told her again that we needed the checks split and she waved us off. The food was "OKAY" - nothing that screams out for a James Beard or anything. My TORTILLA soup was watery and packed with corn kernels and some cheese, then topped with deep fried WON TON STRIPS (not tortilla strips). My burger came out cold and dry (not dry  texture, but literally DRY, with no sauce). I asked for some remoulade or mayo and ten minutes later they came back with italian dressing in a cup and said "we don't have any of that other stuff." Funny, it was in the menu... So I choked down my burger and waited for my check. And waited. And waited. When it arrived it came split in two. We had asked for separate checks but four of us ended on one tab and two ended on the other. The waitress then accused us of not telling her that we wanted our checks split. Then why did she split the freaking check in TWO?! No idea what happened there. 15 minutes later she returned with the split checks and we gave her the credit cards. Another 15 minutes later we sent one of our party to hunt her down. The manager came out at one point and just smiled at us like she had no idea what we were talking about. We ended up burning almost 2 hours at this establishment. 5 minutes after that she finally returned with our checks. I don't think I'll be back.

Smoky backyard burgers like dad used to grill, crispy fried zucchini spears, fresh squeezed lemonade, and all at affordably low prices! The owners/employees are super friendly and they serve REAL diner fries (not those crap ruffled ones Denny's switched to or the undercooked steak fries at Red Robin). I highly recommend the International with bacon and cheese! If I have one complaint it's that they close too early on Saturdays and aren't open Sundays. Thank the Lord my sister turned me on to this place - how I've lived down the street for six years without once stopping in is beyond me!

So I had this $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com that clearly stated "NO EXPIRATION DATE" and what happens? They won't take it. So yeah, I've had it forever and always forgot to bring it with me but that's beside the point - it says "NO EXPIRATION"!!! So starting off on the wrong foot, we stood in the doorway for a while until I chased down a waitress to ask where we could sit. The patio and bar were full and only one table was available inside. We sat and were quickly attended to by a great server (Eddie) who was obviously super busy but never once ignored us. The food was so-so; I remember it being better in the past when this place was not nearly as busy. The calamari was a bit soggy but decent tasting and the rock shrimp tempura was slightly soggy as well but OUT OF THIS WORLD in flavor! All of the sushi rolls on the special menu were either deep fried or covered in spicy mayo. You think I kid; I don't. And honestly, something tasted off, not super fishy but like the Hamachi had been previously frozen for a month and wasn't fresh? Unfortunately Tammy wasn't behind the bar so I didn't stop to piss and moan and make a scene but had she been there and had a moment to chat (like she has in the past) I probably would have said something. Even though I really want to give this place 1 star for tonight's several moments of WTF, Eddie was a killer attentive server, the food was expeditiously prepared, I think Tammy is a cool chick, and the all-day happy hour and sushi costs can't be beat anywhere in this state. I used to think Pearl was a underrated, hidden gem but apparently some of the quality has suffered with the increase in business. Too bad, now it's just a place you can say "you get what you pay for" and that is truly unfortunate.

Holy balls! Got here 20 minutes before they opened but they let me in early. Had my complimentary tire rotation done in like 10 minutes flat; felt like I had my very own NASCAR pit crew! And they didn't even give me grief that I hadn't bought my tires there or try to talk me into something I didn't need! On the negative side, they rushed so fast that one of the air thingies was loose and I lost half the air in my back tire as I pulled out. Either way, I love these guys!

Mr. Phipps NEVER disappoints! He has catered our family's holiday functions for the last couple of years (including this past Christmas Eve) and we just can't get enough! Love the ribs, love the fried pickles and okra, love the sweet tea! LOVE STACY'S!

Sometimes I wish I had been raised in a Kosher deli - but since I wasn't, Chompie's is the next best thing that I've found here in Arizona! So they lost a star for their service (which wavers between mediocre and non-existent) but the food is definitely AWESOME!   I wish I had actually eaten here prior to 2009 but when I first tried 5 years earlier, I was left standing in the entrance without a single greeting or friendly look for at least 10 minutes; I figured they didn't want my business so I took my family by the hand and left. I came back only to receive the same cold unwelcome and after several glances my way and no offer of assistance I turned to leave. I was just about to walk out when the (owner? manager?) came running after us. She was brusque but she apologized and seated us herself. What followed next was a smorgasbord of naughty, bad fun! Dill pickles, mini latkas, pirogies, a halved knish smothered with corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss, and the most killer matzoh ball soup that I have tried to duplicate at home several times but to no avail!   At first glance the prices seem a little steep for a deli but it's acceptable when you realize the quality and QUANTITY of the food you're getting. In fact, we usually end up walking out with half our food in doggy bags so sharing is perfectly acceptable! Besides, they offer different specials and deals every day of the week from Kids Eat Free to BOGO burgers! My favorite deal? 20% off ANY TIME for all active duty, retired, and veteran military members! Just don't forget to grab a dozen Lacies on the way out - you won't be sorry!

I'm hesitant to say that this is the greatest Yelp find of 2011, only because I want to keep the goodies ALL TO MYSELF! But then I realize that maybe one day I can't get down there, and then they close, and then how would I live?!   The people who operate the newly dubbed "La Promesa" bakery are AH-MAHZING, and the food is just as equally AH-MAHZING! I came too early to grab the fabled green burrito but I did snag a few green chile tamales (moist and packed full of shredded meat), assorted fruit pastries (flakey and DELISH), and some homemade tortillas. My only regret is that we had stopped here on the way to the State Fair and it made all of that would-be delightful fair food pale in comparison. That, and La Promesa is closed on Sundays... WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?!

Until this place opened I had no idea that the "korokke" my grandmother loved to snack on when I was a kid was actually a "croquette" (only pronounced with a heavy Korean accent), lol! The reason people think it's not "authentic" is probably because the owners are Korean and this is their take on Japanese fast food - much like when you visit a Chinese restaurant in Koreatown and order sweet and sour pork only to get "tang soo yuk", the Korean version of the Chinese staple (which I think tastes INFINITELY better). The food is decently priced and pretty tasty but my indecision and desire to sample most and/or all of my childhood favorites usually results in racking up of a mildly hefty bill for a teriyaki bowl joint. I love the place, the sushi is rolled on order (not sitting pre-made in some fridge like at the grocers), and the owners are very friendly and always remember my disdain for onions in any form. The only reason I avoided 5 stars was because the raw fish is not the freshest and the potato tempura needs to be sliced thinner or cooked longer, but everything else is great and always takes me fondly down memory lane!

I'm adding an additional star to my original review, only because someone from Urban Yoga actually went out of her way to contact me today and address my injury issue. After hearing everything I had to say, she apologized for the employee I spoke with a couple of days ago and was nice enough to extend my membership by a month so that I would be able to get full use of my Groupon. Thanks Urban Yoga!

The hot dog is, well, a boiled hot dog wrapped in bacon on a generic bun - BUT the toppings are WHAT MAKES THIS PLACE! The $3 price tag doesn't hurt either! Breaking the dog down: it's topped with diced tomatoes and onions in mayo, pinto beans, and your choice of salsa verde, (parmesan? cotija?) cheese, guacamole, shredded cheese, and marinated mushrooms. I went sans the onions, mushrooms, and shredded cheese but the result was a fiery tastebud explosion! In one word: BOMB! (In a good way!) Don't be afraid to give this place a try! It's shady looking but I didn't get sick from it and you won't be sorry!

This update is based SOLELY on the events that occured after posting my last review. After my birthday was basically ruined on my last visit to Fogo, the manager of the restaurant personally contacted me to apologize and offer to make it up to my family. Not only did he take the time to listen and apologize for the events of the night but offered to buy our dinner the next time we came in. I truly believe this is what is missing in America today. Since when did service oriented businesses stop emphasizing the importance of customer satisfaction and begin acting like our patronage was a privilege they were affording US? Although I have not returned for my do-over dinner, the manager's actions have ensured that it is a place I would definitely return to, over and over again!

Absolutely amazing experience! I am brand new to yoga and my introduction was by way of Madison Improvement Club this last Monday. Even though I signed up for a beginner's fundamentals class at MIC, the instructor seemed to think it was a phenomenal flow class. She called out poses that I had NO IDEA how to do, didn't make any adjustments, and didn't play relaxing music or have much of a relaxing voice.   Thank goodness for Lara at Metta Yoga! She really accommodated me even though I signed up for a flow class instead of a beginner's class. The atmosphere was super relaxed and casual, and Lara really made me feel at home even though I was completely uncoordinated. The facility is small and clean, the classes are a manageable size and a mixture of all levels, and I really enjoyed the entire experience.   I'm not a very spiritual person and I tend to hightail and run from activities that walk that fine line of crazy. I was really worried that yoga, in general, would be a bit nuttier than I like, but the neatest thing I found about the entire experience was finding that moment of real inner peace. For lack of a better term: zen? Quieting your mind and listening to your body really does open your eyes to an entire new experience - and before you know it, an entire 75 minutes has zipped by. If I were a spiritual person, I'd say that finding your moment of zen is almost like catching a glimpse of heaven. Thanks to Lara, I now know exactly what I'm searching for when practicing yoga.

I can't speak to any of the other medical services, but the medically supervised weight loss program is TOP NOTCH.   Dr. Brandon Kim is the absolute best! He's helped me lose 37 pounds in just 3 months on Ideal Protein - best of all, I learned to lose it the HEALTHY WAY, without starving myself, back-breaking exercise, invasive surgery, or dangerous narcotics. I went from a size 16 to a size 8, and I will reach my goal in (hopefully) less than two months!   The program is pricey, but when you think about how much you spend on being fat, unhealthy, and miserable, Ideal Protein is a solid investment in happiness!

My famous last words before dinner were: how can you screw up fried food? Well, Pete's found a way! The general consensus was that Pete's takes delivery of their rectangular fish patties from the same general supplier McDonald's must use. Not that this is the most terrible thing in the world - I myself am a lover of the occasional Filet-O-Fish, but I guess when a place's claim to fame is "fish and chips" you kind of expect REAL battered fish and chips, malt vinegar, or at least some fried clams, hush puppies, or real zucchini spears. Alas, none of the above. Joseph Malin would have turned over in his grave. Even my eight year old daughter was left wondering what kind of fish produces rectangular filets and what kind of shrimp comes shaped like a flat plank. I found the experience likened to that of volunteering to chaperone a children's carnival: glad I tried it once, I might even get guilted into doing it twice after the selective amnesia kicks in, but I'll never do it on purpose again. In my experience "cash only" places are generally worth making the extra stop at an ATM for; meh, Pete's - not so much.

Stepping in to The Parlor was a welcomed escape from the madness that is the Camelback Corridor. I don't know exactly what I expected but I was definitely taken by surprise, and in a most positive way! I loved the interior and the crowd seemed to be a potpourri of mostly young twenty-somethings: couples, young parents, and groups of friends. We purposely asked to be seated near other kids or a loud party to drown out the tantrums that would inevitably possess my toddler following the antipasti course. Seeing how we only warranted dirty looks from one couple (and they looked boring and stupid anyhow so who really cares) I would say the seating arrangement wad ideal. The restaurant was packed but there wasn't really a wait and it never effected the quality of the service, and I have to say the food was pretty tasty! It seemed mildly pricey for the portions but the food was definitely good. We had the cauliflower gratinata (needed salt and maybe some gruyere or other melty swiss, the cheddar was more like a beschamel), the roasted beet salad (WINNING!), a pepperoni pizza (a little TOO salty but still delish nonetheless!), and a duck club, which my husband said tasted just like Thanksgiving! Overall, I like the ambiance, I like the service, I like the food, and I would totally come back!

They have a yummy quiche for breakfast, delicious soup filled sourdough bread bowls, a decent chicken walnut salad sandwich (I recommend getting it on a croissant), and phenomenal oatmeal chocolate chip nibblers! If I have one complaint it's that people with computers seem to totally take over all of the inside tables just for the free wifi. I don't typically have a problem with people who take advantage of free wifi at eateries but when you have a party of three and you're looking for a table during the breakfast/lunch rush only to find that every four top and booth is being usurped for hours at a time by a single person with a coffee and a huge computer, it gets super annoying.

I thought long and hard about taking away a star after the Panera Bread/Paradise Bakery merger - especially since they have discontinued my beloved quiche; but the people are so darn friendly there and the broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl covered in extra shredded cheddar is so amazingly delicious I just can't. For the record, I'd like to re-iterate my "BOO" for the decision to strike quiche off the menu but it's still a decent place to grab lunch or a snack. BOO! (one last time...)

Shopped my jewelry around a bit before coming here and this was by far the best offer any buyer had made me. I wish I wouldn't have wasted all of my time and just gone straight to SW Jewelry Buyers from the start, but at the same time, if I had done that, I wouldn't have known SWJ was the best! So glad SWJ made this process less painful than it should have been. This is my one stop shop from here on out!

This was the first stop of many on bachelorette party limo excursion. We stopped in with a rambuncious group of about 20 inebriated ladies and it was definitely time well spent! We ordered several plates of mixed bruschetta (I loved the filet and horseradish one best, but then again, I AM a self-professed carnivore!) and I had a panini with fig, brie, and prosciutto. The panini was accompanied by a large mass of garlic shoestring fries which were a big hit with the masses, and even though the mixed drinks can get a little pricey (as is the Scottsdale way), I highly enjoyed several of their $2 a glass wine special - especially considering it was prime drinking time on a Saturday night in Old Town. The waiter was AWESOME and he made sure we all had our seperate checks in order and were all well taken care of. I would definitely come back to this place over and over again!

What can I say, other than that John Hill is pure magic. I can count the number of decent massages I have had on one hand, and until today, I don't think I knew what a great massage really was. John is simply blessed with a gift. He is shrouded in peace, and has an uncanny ability to really hear what is going on inside of the human body. I entered Space seeking relaxation and relief from pain, and as my pain melted away, I found total serenity. I'm not a regular seeker of massage, but I have a feeling that after today, I will be!

Full disclosure: I haven't seen Dr. Sabol in years.  In fact the last time I saw him - his office may have been on 32nd Street? Either way, it was a time before Yelp but I try to never forget to give credit where credit is still due (when I remember). As my friend was asking me for oral surgeon recommendations this morning, I distinctly remembered my one and only experience with Dr. Sabol with fondness - or as much fondness as I could, considering he was drilling into my face with sharp tools. I quickly found his information online to pass along to her and decided to leave this review. In retrospect, perhaps it's a a good thing that I've only needed Dr. Sabol's services on one occasion. I had an issue with a tooth that required the touch of a specialist for what would be an extremely nasty root canal. I was referred to Dr. Sabol by my regular dentist of 12 years who said he didn't dare attempt this root canal himself. Dr. Sabol took very good care of me and even though I remembered feeling a little silly seeing him for something he fixed so quickly and simply (when he specializes in so many extensive and complicated cases), Dr. Sabol made me feel like I was just as important a patient as any. Anyhoo, hope I never need his services again, but if I do - I'm glad he's still in the neighborhood.

The moment I bit into my peppercorn burger, I forgot what all other burgers before this moment had tasted like. Yeah, it was that good.   A softball shaped hunk of beef with a crispy peppercorn crust 360 degrees around and dripping with juicy goodness inside, even when it was requested well done. It's almost like biting into a choice cut of filet mignon. There is no sauce on the burger and the seasoning is light handed but the juices flowing from the burger patty more than make up for the misstep. The bun is deliciously soft and the watercress with the charred onion compliment the burger perfectly but I felt like the potato straws were oddly stale and totally unnecessary. If they were meant to add a crunchy texture to the dish, they failed miserably.    The herbed fries were tasty but I think some chopped garlic and shredded parmesan would have elevated them to a "best of" status. Maybe even a little drizzle of truffle oil wouldn't have hurt.   The Grind lost one star for charging my kids full price on their beverages ($2.50 for a styrofoam cup of lemonade that didn't need a refill?) and for the Mac and Cheese. I was happy to see they gave a $1 discount for a "kids mac" on the bill but other than the elbow pasta being perfectly cooked al dente, the cheese sauce was completely BLAH. I would think that with a  famed claim to a 1000 degree oven they'd be broiling the crap out of the cheesiest macaroni possible, but alas we got a small cast iron dish of white pasta that even a tablespoon of salt could not save.    Overall, I'd go back but probably just for the burgers and maybe to try the charred veggies, seasonal specials, and delectable looking desserts.

With frozen yogurt and ice cream novelty shops popping up on nearly every corner in the Arcadia/Biltmore area, it's hard to distinguish one place from the next. But Zen Zen has two things every other self serve joint has yet to show me - taro frozen yogurt and fresh rainbow mochi! Maybe it's just the part of me that yearns for my native Los Angeles but these are two hometown items that are hard to come by here in Arizona. The only reasons I didn't award 5 stars to Zen Zen is because the taro is not available every week, the coconut flakes are a bit dry, and someday I hope to see pineapple yogurt on the menu!

SUPER AMAZEBALLS!   Quick background: My first plumber was AMAZING but after several years of faithful service he moved away to become a law enforcement officer, and we couldn't be happier for him. Second plumber I loved as well. Unfortunately he was only plumbing his way through school and once graduation came and went, we lost him too - but once again, super proud of him. Made a date with Sav-On last night and was stood up. They say they spoke to my husband last night and rescheduled for this afternoon (which is funny because my caller ID shows no calls last night, my husband is still ticked that they never returned our calls, and on top of that, my husband works all day so there is no way he would have said he would be home this afternoon to receive them...) I say they have crappy customer service and were dodging the SEVEN CALLS I placed to them when they didn't show up on time. Either way, I ended up all alone and plumber-less.   So apparently, getting stood up by Sav-On was the best thing that ever happened to me. At the recommendation of my friend Jennie, I called Diamondback last night, and today I met Bryan. Not only did he beat the price quoted to me by another reputable east valley plumbing company I had used before, but the dispatcher kept me in the loop on his ETA, he showed up ON TIME, quickly resolved the situation, loved my dog, and went on his merry way! Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a keeper!

So the food is like 4 stars but the stellar service deserves 5 and then some! My husband hates the neighborhood and upon entry, no one was there to greet us until I coughed really loudly - we were wary at first but after the initial entry, it was a rollercoaster of nonstop WHOA! Walking into the dining room we were taken aback by the homey but intimate feel of the place. There were two long planters filled with blue mosaic glass and lit from underneath creating a whimsical glow, two long cozy red couch lined tables at either end of the dining room, and a wood burning pizza oven near the kitchen where you could see them actually baking bread!  They brought out some fresh "foccacia" that was brushed with olive oil and spices - I wouldn't so much call it a foccacia as a flat bread but who really cares, it was DELICIOUS! Crisp on the outside, soft and warm on the inside; my child likened it to eating "really yummy pizza crust"! Then came the apps. We did the antipasti platter for 2 and it was HUGE! There wasn't a thing on that plate that didn't blow us away - the calamari was crispy and covered half the plate (yay for tentacles!), the ravioli and caprese were great too but the bruschetta, OH THE BRUSCHETTA! It was simply INCREDIBLE! Our entrees came next - they were decent but nothing that blew our minds. I had the mushroom pappardelle, my husband went with the chicken Marsala, and my kids split the asparagus capellini. I was thinking that since this place is Gasper's Pizzeria we probably should have gotten at least one pizza but live and learn! The standout at dinner was definitely the peas that accompanied the Marsala dish. I don't know what was in them but they were like no other peas we had ever had - crisp, sweet, slightly charred, and OMG! After dinner our server convinced us to try dessert. She brought two cannolis and another HOME RUN! I usually hate cannolis with their nasty shells, gross pudding type filling, and raunch chocolate chips but this was none of the above. There were two crispy shells filled with a thick creamy filling laced with a lemony scent and dusted with confectioners sugar, no chocolate chips to be found and after 5 minutes, nothing left on the plate at all! The food was great, the service was stellar, and we will definitely be coming back - especially since this morning I woke up with an intense craving for cannoli...

Went for lunch today and was very pleasantly impressed! I had been through before when yes, the credit card machine was down, and yes, there was no drive thru, and yes, half the shave ice flavors were unavailable but this is quite obviously no longer the case! The service is amazing due to the glowing persona of the proprietor John and the fact that the "confused" and "shaky" girls who used to work there are no more! The prices are very decent and the food, very delicious! We had the island dog (YUM!) with fries and tater tots, and shave ice; John also allowed us to sample his cole slaw, mango pico, and chili which were great as well! Beyond the obvious delectable dogs, the chili is Cali style vegetarian with black beans and corn - DELICIOUS and light yet "meaty"! The island style slaw made WITHOUT MAYO is an absolute revelation. The fries taste a lot like the ones at In N Out, not as crispy but the same flavor profile that comes with fresh cut fries. The tots are crispy and salty - just the way my kids love them, and the whole time they were demolishing the shave ice I didn't hear a "peep". It was a peaceful culinary journey to the islands that didn't break the bank!

My first two experiences with Lucky Strike/Gypsy were less than stellar (see my review of Gypsy Bar in 2012). In fact, my first two experiences were so bad that I vowed never to return. Then I was contacted by the new manager of Lucky Strike/Gypsy informing me that the bar I despised was now under new management, had a new chef, a new menu, and a new staff with a new attitude. I was intrigued.   My mind is not often changed once it's set, but in this case - the new management team behind Lucky Strike and Gypsy Bar have completely turned this place around. The drinks and food continue to be a bit pricey for a "bar," but they still offer great lunch and happy hour specials, and now there's a HUGE difference - the food actually tastes great and the service is amazing.   For three hours tonight my friends and I bowled, ate, and drank to our heart's content. We started out with the homemade Belgian fries with chimichurri aioli and the short rib tacos. The fries were delish, and the tacos were decent - I liked the short rib meat and sauce on the taco, but the shells were a little stale. I suggest that in the future they should serve the tacos in soft corn tortillas and replace the blah lettuce with some sugar cured cabbage (a la Fuego Tacos) because the shell and rabbit food just detracted from the great texture and flavor of the filling and sauce. We also ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread, the chicken quesadilla, and blue chips off of the $4 happy hour menu. I didn't try any of those, but from the way the chips and quesadillas disappeared, I assume they were fine. The flatbreads didn't really win anyone over, but two out of three ain't bad. We also ordered the grilled steak sandwich and the crispy bread pudding bites. The steak was a fatty cut and the juices soaked the bottom piece of grilled artisan bread, but it was seasoned PERFECTLY and the bread managed to hold together. I actually love steak juices and found the bottom piece of bread to be a soppy piece of heaven - much like when I find myself eating a really good French dip with grilled crusty bread and a perfect au jus. The crispy bread pudding bites came with a creme anglaise and were vaguely reminiscent of a simpler time in Jack in the Box's history when they served delicious deep friend french toast sticks on their 24 hour breakfast menu. In layman's terms, the tiny squares of deep fried bread pudding were extremely addictive and hit the spot.    Overall, I was pretty impressed with the revamped menu. The tacos and sandwiches were about $14 each and some of the premium cocktails were about $13 each - once again on the high end - but they were all tasty and I really did enjoy myself with their clean facility, multitude of games available, and spazzy bowling alley. I would give Lucky Strike/Gypsy bar a solid 4 stars for the reimagined bar food menu and ability to entertain people of all ages. However, it was the service that shot this place over the moon for me. The bartenders, management, and servers were AMAZING and I have no problem recommending this place for anyone looking to have a great time with good food, good friends, and really good service.

Super amazing and efficient! They charge per worker (teams of 3) and per hour. I was quoted for 3 hours but the service ran over to 4.5 hours - and that was TOTALLY okay because they were doing a great job and my house hadn't been professionally cleaned in about nine years. The team showed up 5 or 6 minutes late but got right down to it. They cleaned things I didn't expect them to, including doing dishes, taking out the garbage, and making the beds. They didn't get the baseboards, standing fans, lower vents, or kitchen hood very well, but if I had wanted to pay for another hour, they probably would have. I also declined to do a walk through as I was already an hour and a half late getting on with my day. If I had to knit pick, I really didn't love that when they moved things to clean an area, they didn't put everything back where they had found them. But the actual cleaning that was done was done immaculately, and I will definitely be using them again!

I got some pretty terrible directions from the Internet to The Arrogant Butcher, and finding a working phone number on-line was an absolute  nightmare, but once I got past the construction and to the actual restaurant, I was really impressed! The service was scarce but I don't blame the facility - I was there for a private function and more people than expected had shown up leaving the servers understaffed and the kitchen overworked. They had Sangiovese on the wine menu which is a MAJOR plus considering it is one of my favorite dry red italian wines, and I was totally blown away by the tabbouleh salad (bulgar wheat, peppadews, and marcona almonds, tossed with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, and romaine in an oregano dressing) and the salted caramel pudding (heavenly for those into the salty/sweet thing)! The short rib stew with egg was a bit spicy but tasty nonetheless and the accompanying corn muffin was a bit eggy from the wash, but the glaze atop was sweet, crispy, and a delicious delight! My husband said his salmon and blueberry cheesecake were "alright" but he enjoyed the tabbouleh salad immensely! I'd definitely go there again in the future - if only to get another tabbouleh salad and a taste of the fabled peanut butter cup!

This place is simply AMAZING! The Secret Village peddles a myriad of eclectic trinkets and treasures, and trying to list every single treat you might discover in this three building gallery of goodies just wouldn't be possible. The back building houses mostly boho chic clothing, luggage, toiletries, toys, games, jewelry, and pet accessories. One of the front buildings is filled with books, stationary, candles, and european home decor. And the other front building is filled with kitchen accessories, cooking gadgets, and gourmet specialty foods. Mind you, this is a MINUSCULE list of what you'll ACTUALLY find within so it's well worth a visit!   I often find myself exploring the stores when I'm desperately in need of a unique and special last minute gift for between $20-$30. Nothing is more awkward than insincere gifting! Like that moment when you present your "good friend" with the pre made lotion basket from Bath & Body Works, and the room falls silent as the basket screams, "I don't really know anything about you!" Shopping at the Secret Village helps you avoid this embarrassment. From vintage business card holders to wrought iron wine cork containers, to giant sushi shaped pillows and Pinot Noir scented soap, this place is an incredible gifting extravaganza! I didn't think the prices were extraordinarily high, but you can also sign up to be on their email list and each month they'll send out a 20% off coupon!   Even if you're just looking to kill some time, I highly suggest stopping by this place. It's AMAZING and you won't be sorry!

Ummm... Drive-Thru boba? How can this be a BAD thing? Well, it just so happens that it CAN'T! Thai Iced Tea, Taro, and Honeydew too! This place is the BEST! The lady who runs the counter is VERY nice and the donuts are delicious! Stopped in for a Honeydew melon boba and a ham and cheese croissant and my kids spent the next hour munching quietly on donut holes, which was just a reward in itself! The prices are cheap, the service is friendly, and I will take BoSa over Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts ANY day of the week! Also an FYI, ignore the BoSa website - this location does NOT serve kolache's and they have their own hours which I believe are 5am-10pm every day!

So, I really hate buffets in Arizona. They suck, they're shady, and they make me want to cry or vomit or both. I'm a HUGE fan of eating - throw in unlimited eating of half decent foods and we're talking solid gold! Needless to say, Vegas is my kind of town! However, since I don't live in Vegas, finding all you can eat options in Phoenix has become my new life's passion. Enter Red Wok. Now, it's no Fogo de Chao, it's not really even Las Vegas Blvd worthy, but it IS off-boulevard sketchy strip mall worthy in the highest sense of the word! The actual facility is surprisingly beautiful and clean! The food is okay for buffet food (a solid 3.5 stars) but here's the clincher: all you can eat char siu bau, chinese spare ribs, fried plantains, kalbi, and kimchee and it's all GOOD! The soups are a little bland and I pretty much avoided the rice/chow mein fillers but most of the other things were pretty darn delicioso! I saw boiled crawfish and peel and eat shrimp but I haven't decided if I'm brave enough for that venture just yet - I did eat a sushi roll and although it didn't SEEM gross, I think mentally I can't get over the idea of buffet sushi - much like I'm sure tongue tastes great but Jesus man, it's TONGUE! At  just under $9 for an adult lunch with drink, I actually feel like I'm getting my money's worth and then some! I am actually planning to return to try the ice cream and Mongolian BBQ station but considering I just downed half  dozen mini coffee cakes, I think I'll call it a night. I loved the facility, I loved the service, I liked the food, but add the Marvin Gaye and circa 1980's Madonna playing in the background and I'm totally sold! :)

After an exceptionally rough day at work, I was nursing a serious craving for something sweet and sticky. I had driven past Squarz at least a dozen times with the intention of stopping, but never quite making it in. With no idea what to expect, I took a chance. And so happy that I did. The genius behind this quaint little enterprise is as sweet as the pastries he churns out daily. I tried the Kouign Amann today - it was a five star surprise. Just like Steven said - CRACK! Sweet, but not too sweet. A little bit salty. Sticky, yet flakey. The crust on the savory pies - impossibly flakey, light, and buttery. The spinach feta and chicken pot pie were to die for. Can't explain what was in the chicken pot pie but it had an unexpected sweet flavor to it and I loved every single last bite. And the spinach feta was AMAZING. There just were no words. After that taste explosion, I will definitely be back very soon to try everything else on the menu!

Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their ALL-DAY happy hour every Sunday! The bucatini and meatballs at $5 is an absolute STEAL - I highly recommend doing a double order and calling it dinner! The noodles are homemade and delectably thick and chewy, the red sauce is fresh, and the small meatballs are moist and delicious!   We started tonight with the grilled artichoke, which was extremely tasty but highly overpriced at $12 for a single small/medium sized artichoke. We also ordered the arancini, which was oozing with cheesy goodness and comes three to an order. During happy hour, the arancini is $5 an order, which is totally reasonable for the size of the app; regular price is about double. I ordered the braised short rib and ricotta gnocchi, which was beautifully presented and nicely cooked, but it was bland and lacked seasoning. The bombolini dessert was a lovely end to a great meal - four cinnamon sugar covered "beignets" on a bed of real vanilla mascarpone and Meyer lemon curd.   The service was amazing and the food was great! The only downfalls were the intense number of flying insects invading our table space and the co-ed bathrooms. I'm all for social progress but there's a good reason men and women have maintained separate bathrooms throughout history, and it has nothing to do with gender segregation. It's just that guys always pee all over the toilet seats...   Overall, it was another great dining experience, brought to you courtesy of Fox Restaurant Concepts, and we will definitely be taking advantage of this happy hour again in the near future!

For what King Wong is, it's excellent. It's fast food Chinese; just one step above Panda Express, probably one step above an all-you-can-eat buffet, and likely one step below a fancy sit-down.   When I moved to Arizona from Southern California, I was shocked to find that practically nobody offered delivery service - especially when it came to Chinese food. In California, it was just a matter of whether you wanted Hunan, Cantonese, or Szechuan delivered. I was wary of King Wong because it's predecessor hadn't delivered quality grub in the past. Tonight, I didn't have much of a choice. I couldn't leave the house and just about anything sounded better than pizza. Thank goodness I ran across an old King Wong menu!   The service is SUPER friendly. The food is SUPER cheap. The portions are SUPER huge. I was promised delivery in 45 minutes and the promise was fulfilled in 40. The food also filled the container completely - like to the top.   I only ordered Mu Shu Pork and Chicken Lo Mein tonight, so I can't speak for anything else on the menu. The order included white rice and two free egg rolls. With delivery, it was around $17. The Mu Shu was tasty but a tiny bit salty, although it was probably my liberal use of the hoisin sauce that pushed it over the edge for my taste buds. The pancakes were a little coarse - definitely not made fresh - but I ate them all. My kids devoured the lo mein and egg rolls without complaint, which is rare because my kids are highly suspicious of new noodle joints and almost never eat egg rolls. I thought their chicken was a tad under seasoned, but it didn't seem to bother them much.   I'm actually looking forward to ordering from King Wong again in the future. It's not a fancy restaurant, but it's not meant to be. Like I said, for what it is, it's pretty great.

As far as I'm concerned, this joint is legit. It's the recession diners trifecta: delicious, friendly, and CHEAP. From the outside, it looks vacant and possibly condemned - the sign even says "HURS", which I just assume means "HOURS". However, once you set foot inside, your worries melt away with the sweet scent of jasmine rice, cilantro, and sizzling pork product. There was 90's R&B softy playing overhead and the gentleman who waited on me was witty, charming, and very talkative - and no, there was no "language barrier," as his English was spot on. He seemed to know almost every diner by name and order number. I had a Banh Mi - a decent sized BBQ pork sandwich trimmed with cucumber, daikon radish, carrot, jalape√±o, lettuce, and cilantro on a crusty French roll, for just $2.95! Then came the Pho Tai - which was PHENOMENAL, and a steal at $5.50 a bowl. The noodles were a little more on the "al dente" side, but not to an obnoxious degree. In fact, most Pho places in Arizona seem to err on the side of "mushy" and this was a refreshing change. Even though the neighborhood leaves much to be desired, I will definitely be a regular diner (at least during daylight hurs), and I truly hope Pho House can manage to keep its doors open for a long time to come.

I could have absolutely sworn that I had already written a review about Sakura, but it seems that my former review has magically disappeared!  So I can't speak to the quality of the food, because after 20 minutes we were never even once approached for our order - but I will likely never be returning to find out!   We stopped in at 8pm one evening after a movie with a party of six. It took about 10 minutes of standing awkwardly in the foyer before I finally flagged down one of the four employees sitting at the bar and asked to be seated. A nice lady promptly brought us water and then was never to be heard from again. I kept glancing back over at the bar hoping someone would catch my drift, but after 20 minutes we just gave up and walked over to Red Robin. Too bad.

Rarely do you ever call an experience with a plumber or electrician pleasant or desirable, because most times, you're calling them in emergent situations and most times, it's going to cost you time and money. Without a doubt, today was definitely a most unexpected and pleasant experience!  So, my regular electrician was MIA. In sheer desperation, I called Meade. I can't speak to the residential in-home service practice of this electrician, but the fact that Meade tried to resolve my problem over the phone instead of insisting on showing up just to charge me a service call fee for an issue they could have resolved over the phone makes this guy all aces in my book! Not only was the man courteous, he really did solve my problem over the phone, free of charge. He saved me about $65, so the least I can do is leave this review and hope that others have as pleasant an experience as I had today!   P.S. It was the reset button.

Breakfast nachos. 'Nuff said.  Just kidding. But seriously, breakfast nachos. Several years ago I woke up one morning craving breakfast nachos. Only they hadn't been invented. Thanks to DD my breakfast nacho dream has finally come to fruition...  So I went to DD on a Saturday morning around 8am. There was no wait, the place was half empty, and the venue was nice, but oh yeah, there was no one to greet or seat. The girl at the bar glanced our way once or twice and we stood there for a while until I decided to seat myself. As I was already seating myself, girl at bar says "GO AHEAD AND SEAT YOURSELVES! SOMEONE WILL BRING YOU A MENU!" Uh, thanks? We sat. And sat. Finally I got up and grabbed our own menus from the server station. As I was passing menus around my table, a server thanked me. That was weird. From there things started looking up.  Our server was patient and helpful. Our food came out in half the time that it typically takes the hair club at U.S. Egg. It was all pretty good - until breakfast nachos... After taking a bite of that, my prime rib eggs benedict with DD hash just seemed so BLAH. The eggs, english muffin and hollandaise were perfectly cooked but the prime rib was unimpressive to say the least. Overcooked and under-seasoned - I actually preferred the meat in a microwaveable Steak-Ums to whatever this was. The hash was good, but I think they should switch from squash to sweet potato. Maybe add bacon bits. Personal preference.   The peach creme br√ªl√©e pancakes had a perfectly crisp halo and tasted like breakfast birthday cake! The kids portions were generous, and at one point, the manager (or owner?) came by to check on us, which was really nice.  But the breakfast nachos... O. M. G. I'm convinced this is the invention of poor, drunken college students at Denny's. It's like breakfast, but like nachos, that you can dunk in gravy... It sounds wrong but don't knock it 'til you try it. It's pretty unforgettable.

Food is pretty darn good - they get points for having fresh made whole wheat tortillas, free quesadillas for kids under six, and a free enchilada style option on the burritos. I prefer the red sauce to the green, the pinto beans to the black beans, and the Barbacoa to Chipotle's lame excuse for Barbacoa. I only wish they were consistent in their prices and service. One day I got a tiny scoop of guacamole for free, the next day it was $1.50. Then they charged me $7.50 for a plain cheese quesadilla when the week before it was a fraction of that price. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that these are just growing pains, but seriously $7.50?!?!

What a difference two years can make. Another reviewer nailed it when they said that as the company has grown, quality has suffered - and the worst part is, Cafe Rio corporate just doesn't care. This used to be one of my favorite fast-casual dining options in Phoenix, but now, it's just terrible. The food quality is inconsistent, the employees don't know how to tightly roll a burrito or assemble a salad, and the service is chock full of attitude I don't remember ordering. I've written an angry letter to the corporate office but I don't expect to hear back from them, like ever. So sad.

It was my first yoga class ever. I thought it was "okay" but  since trying out other places in the neighborhood, I now realize that Madison Improvement Club isn't really that great - especially for true beginners.   As a complete newbie, I made time in my busy evening schedule to attend an "ABC" class  - which I guess is about fundamentals and what not. When I got there, the instructor was someone other than who I had signed up for, but she said she taught the other ABC class, so I figured I'd just give it a go. Well, considering I didn't know ANYTHING about yoga, I was pretty upset that she didn't give much direction and didn't make any adjustments. If I wanted to act like I knew what I was doing, I probably would have bought DDP yoga online and started practicing at home. I wanted to take a class specifically for the INSTRUCTION that, you know, typically accompanies a CLASS setting - but there was none of that here.   I left the class thinking that maybe she didn't say anything because I knew what I was doing, but when I attended a second class down the street at Metta Yoga, I realized I had been doing most of my poses wrong. Maybe it was just the instructor, but the entire experience was a little off-putting. I didn't find her voice soothing or her music choice very zen. There are probably better instructors and classes available, but considering they won't give me the student rate without a printed schedule (hello - it's summer vacation), I won't be back.   Also, as a sidebar - $8 for a 24 oz smoothie??? I juice my own green smoothies at home in a Vitamix with fruit and veg from Costco for less than $2 a day! And it tastes EXACTLY the same...

Meh. I've experienced better. Ain't that the truth!   Stale chips and super oniony guacamole? Even at $3, I should have passed. The order took so long to arrive that I almost cancelled it, and MAN do I wish I had... The only saving grace was the salsa - it was generic but still pretty tasty. The drink specials during happy hour weren't a bad price, but apparently there was some sort of dispute about the happy hour prices being misprinted on the fliers that were all over the bar. The bartendress honored the prices but kept exclaiming that they weren't correct. WHO CARES, LADY?? JUST GIVE ME MY BEER! AND FOR $3!!! The patron to my left asked if she could have a happy hour martini for $4 and the bartender went on a spiel about how the price is in actuality $5, plus a $2 extra alcohol charge for the second type of liquor, so that the martini would actually be $7. Or $9. I was thinking "that is NOT a happy hour martini!" until I realized that in real life (in non-happy hour time) a martini at this place ran twice as much. Sheesh, and no thanks.

Whimsical and wonderful, what else can I say? Lately I've been yearning for a glimpse back in time, to an era when life was less complicated, people were polite, and neighbors were friends. Although I don't have a flux capacitor, Bertie's is my Delorean, and Bertie's owner, Trejsi, delivers 100%.  Everything from vintage clothing and accessories to penny candy, ice cream sodas, and baked delights! Although I can't yet vouch for the soda fountain, a little "Bertie" told me they can make cream sodas to order and I CAN'T WAIT to get a hold of one. What I CAN say is that the baked goods and the sugar shack are alone worth the journey down to the newly revamped 40 Palms shopping centre. Bertie's is just one more reason Arcadia is my favorite place to live in Arizona, and I hope Trejsi stays around for a long time to come, so that I can make trips to Bertie's soda fountain a new tradition in my family.

We're short of five stars for two reasons: 1) I made my appointment WEEKS AGO only to walk into a gaggle of bridal party members who usurped my stylist and forced me into overtime, and 2) no purse hooks in the bathroom. However, the shampoos here are divine and Jenna is the master of curls. I used to laugh at the concept of "blow dry bars" but then I realized that my hair always looks the best when I've had my stylist have a go at it after a color and cut. Then I'm always pissed off when I can't achieve the same result at home. I've probably thought to myself a million times that if I could afford to have a daily personal shampoo/styler I would. Primp and Blow is my temporary answer while I await independent wealth, fame, and fortune to rain down on me, and it isn't horribly overpriced, if you know when and what to ask for. At regular price, a wash/dry/curl will run you $45, not including gratuity. BUT the happy hour wash/dry price is $20, the curl can be added for $10 more, and if you don't want a wash, you can have dry-styling for only $25. A makeup/hair package is $60, but can be adjusted if you're just looking for just eye makeup and a dry style, addition of lashes or up-do, or any combination thereof. I had my makeup done by Jenna at my last appointment. My eye makeup was incredible, but personal preference - I thought the foundation was WAY too thick and cakey. In the future I'd probably just have my eyes done for $15, and maybe even a false eyelash application for another $15, and avoid the foundation. Regardless, I definitely have a new guilty pleasure when it comes to hair!

My disdain for KFC and Church's aside, this is officially the best fried chicken I've had in a REALLY long time! When it comes to homestyle fried chicken, I'm all about Stacy's Pit Stop. But when I need it fast and cheap, I'm a Popeye's girl all the way. Considering that the closest Popeye's is in Tempe, I wasn't left with many choices - until now. Louisiana Fried Chicken falls somewhere in between the two, but you shouldn't scoff because it is AMAZING!   PROS: The batter is crisp and doesn't slide off the entire piece of chicken when you take your first bite (I'm guessing it's a wet batter?), the chicken is well seasoned all of the way through, and best of all, the chicken isn't swimming in grease when it hits the box. The corn nuggets are TO DIE FOR and the dirty rice is spicy, well-seasoned, and pretty decent (although I prefer my own, wallowing in bacon grease...) The hawaiian sweet rolls compliment the spicy/salty chicken and sides perfectly, and although I didn't get a single bite of mashed potatoes and gravy, the husband didn't seem to have any complaints. They also don't skimp on the Louisiana hot sauce; we had plenty of containers left over to go with the remaining chicken!  CONS: No mac and cheese. We hear it's made fresh daily from scratch with six different cheeses, but this dish somehow alludes us. I took away one star because I've read that other people have had this same issue, and my thing is - if you keep running out, KEEP MAKING MORE! I can't wait to try it someday. I will likely call in my takeout order 40 minutes ahead next time, so they have ample opportunity to bake more mac and cheese just for me. There wasn't any sweet tea offered on the menu, but when I peeked over by the beverages, I spotted a Golden Peak tea dispenser. I didn't try it, but from what I remember, Golden Peak sweet tea didn't strike my fancy the last time I tried it. I love that Stacy Phipps brews his sweet tea fresh, and I really, really wish LFC did too because that would just send me sailing over the edge.    I can't wait to go back for more! I'm not quite sure about the people griping on prices. I've paid twice as much for chicken that wasn't half as good. At $20 for 12 pieces, 2 sides, and 6 rolls - this quality fried chicken is a STEAL. Next time, I'm hoping to get some of that fabled mac and cheese, and to try some of their desserts, but for the sake of my appetite, I hope LFC sticks around for a while!

An addendum to my previous review...   After further examination of LFC upon my second visit, I have decided to increase my previous judgment of 4 stars to a total of 5 stars. Although they seem to always be running out of mac and cheese, and they do NOT have fresh brewed sweet tea, I'm convinced by the quality of their cheesy golden mac and cheese (and their excellent customer service) that they deserve the 5th and final star. The mac and cheese takes 35 minutes to make so CALL AHEAD! It is well worth the wait. The noodles are perfectly al dente, the cheese blend is unbelievable, and the entire dish was immaculately seasoned. I suggest eating it while it's HOT because that real cheese coagulates at room temperature (unlike the fake cheesy crap in the boxes) - but honestly, when I microwaved the second container the next day it still tasted great! Louisiana Fried Chicken, congratulations - you are the real thing.

Awesomely incredible ass-kicking workout! They have a super nice staff and specials going on until their January 3rd grand opening! I just paid $79 for 8 sessions a month - regular $99. And they have Groupon specials once in a while (like $29 for 4 sessions or $99 for 10) so watch for those. Now let's get something straight: I'm not a fitness buff by any means. I am 40 pounds overweight, I have two blown knees, a bad back, an old shoulder injury, and asthma. I kept up with the hour long workout at my own pace, wasn't pushed beyond my capability or made to feel bad when I had to modify my regimen, and I actually finished out the class. They are doing a free class NYE and all day January 2nd! They are next to the old Cork N' Cleaver on 44th Street and Camelback so check them out!

I've been waiting, for des-sert like you...   Seriously.   My favorite go-to dessert is typically halo-halo. But when I can't make it out to Mesa or Chandler, the taro SNOH with almond pudding, red bean, and condensed milk glaze will do just fine! I've grown weary of the multitude of frozen yogurt, gelato, and Italian ice shops popping up around town like McStarbucks. SNOH is a refreshing change of pace and strikes my taste buds just right! Love this place and I hope this is just the beginning of a beautiful relationship!

As a spandex clad Will Ferrell once yelled from a conference room atop the Empire State Building: "I'm in love! I'm in love, and I don't care who knows it!" Only I sort of do, because if no one knows it then it'll be Maui Dog all over again, and I don't think my frail appetite could withstand that kind of heartbreak a second time.   We Arcadian's are all too familiar with the "Cursed Cubicle" of land that occupies the space at 3538 East Indian School Road. From Rick's Big Philly to Paul's Little Philly, to my beloved Maui Dog - that space has done nothing but serve as a cruel one night stand of culinary delights, leaving behind a trail of unsatisfied diners in its wake; diners whose only mistake had been daring to dream of something more.   But back to reality. The food at The Stand is a solid four stars. I'll be the first to admit, I've had a better burger. I've even had a better taco. What sets this place apart from all of the other burger joints and taquerias in the area is not just the good food, but the GREAT service. I applaud the staff and enter my judgment of a solid five star rating for the performance put on by the staff of The Stand. These people actually care, and that's why I care.   So here's my breakdown of the PROS and CONS:   They have hand spun milkshakes with FRESH ingredients, like real bananas and salted caramel. And these fresh shakes? They come with real boba-like milkshake straws - AMAZING! The only thing I could find wrong with the shakes was that the salted dulce de leche shake was overly salty - like mouth puckeringly salty. The staff was quick to remedy the situation and delivered a less salty substitute in minutes. This was much better than the first attempt. I think sometimes people tend to forget how overpowering sea salt is - as compared to Kosher salt - and get a little heavy handed.   The thin and crispy tortilla chips are a plus, but the kicker is the fresh mild salsa (and I mean, FRESH), chock full of roasted tomatoes, garlic, green chilies, and spring onions.   I like that they use real potatoes for their skin on fries, but the execution was a little weak - they were lukewarm and inconsistent in crispiness. It's a kink with the fryer temp or the timing in service, but I'm sure they'll work it out.   The burgers were good, like a tasty double patty backyard burger, complete with a "special sauce" of what I assume to be ketchup and mayonnaise, and thick dill slices. I love, love love that they use fresh ground beef and ACTUALLY season the patties with salt and pepper - a mistake that drives me NUTS at other burger joints. It was delicious and took me back to when my grandma used to grill up burgers at home.   Now the tacos are what really hooked me. I was mildly disappointed that the website boasted "stone ground tortillas made daily." Obviously not the case. They use the typical white corn tortillas you can buy at any grocery store, but if you can get over that fact you're going to LOVE the short rib tacos with pickled red cabbage. I am so in love with these tacos, I'm sure I'll be dreaming about them when I go to sleep tonight, and I wouldn't be surprised to wake up in a pool of my own saliva. I also tried the veggie taco, but found it a little uninspired. I was intrigued by the alternative to the basic veggie taco - you know, where they normally take grilled veggies, slap them on a tortilla and say "here's your veggie taco." After being a loyal customer of La Condesa for years, I hardly ever find veggies tacos that measure up, and although The Stand offers a close second, it's missing that  "oomph." I have to say, the addition of quinoa and black bean to the veggie taco was a great idea, but the entire thing was a little difficult to eat, and a little under seasoned.   Over all, it's a great utilization of a small restaurant space: it's clean, well thought out, and the enclosed patio was just a stroke of genius. And a pro for families with kids is that there IS a kids menu available (not available to view in the restaurant or on the website, but it does exist)!   The staff was patient and helpful, quick to make suggestions and corrections where corrections were due; they were actually concerned about what their customers thought, and TOTALLY ON TOP of bussing the tables and making sure their customers had everything they needed. Someday I hope to see an expansion of the menu - I love the idea of keeping it simple but I think my kids would have liked to see a real vanilla milkshake or something like a corn dog or grilled cheese on the kids menu, and I think I'd love to see more burger stand-ins, like roasted poblano chili or fried egg. Mostly the fried egg, because lord knows I am the biggest egg slut on the planet. But for now, I love The Stand the way it is and I can't wait to go back and try the mexican street corn and fresh squeezed lemonade.

After my third visit, I decided to take a critical look at my first review of The Stand, and a lot of mental debate went into keeping my review at 5 stars. Honestly, they're experiencing some growing pains, but I am hopeful that they will get past them successfully. Why? Because they've already corrected the things that irked me on my first trip two weeks ago. The real trick now is to keep their quality from faltering in all other respects. The upside and downside to rave reviews and the success that follows is that you get busy. Really busy.   **On my second trip, they ran out of short rib tacos. *sad face* I tried the chicken but it was pretty uninspired. I missed the crunch of the pickled cabbage, and the chicken was pretty mealy and dry. However, their saving grace was the chocolate chili milkshake - YUM!   **On my third trip in, I noticed that mexican street corn was no longer an option on the menu. *double sad face* I did notice that they were now offering plain chocolate and vanilla milkshakes (YAY). I would still like to see an In-N-Out style grilled cheese on the menu for my vegetarian kid; in this economy I hate having to pay full price for a meatless burger - because let's face it, it's the price of the meat that drives the burger market and in a place like this where the meat is fresh ground (short rib and sirloin?), the meat can't come cheap. Also, they should post a kids menu because kids are everywhere in Arcadia and kids don't like not knowing what's available or what price their parents are paying. Well, they don't really care about the last part, but the parents do! So, the cons of this trip? It was really busy. I blame this "busy-ness" for leading to the Great Onion Debacle of 2013 where onions unfortunately invaded my short rib tacos (EW). And actually, the short rib itself was surprisingly dry. Like I said, probably just another minor kink, because the first time I tried them, they didn't have this problem. The chips were a little stale and not nearly as crisp as the first time - I couldn't help but wonder if they had been sitting out a while. The pros: I did try the fresh squeezed lemonade this trip and it was a tart delight! They also seemed to have worked out the kinks in the fry department because they were executed flawlessly. And as always, the Stand burgers with grilled jalapenos and cheese were stellar!    Everyone has their days, but a caveat: Arcadians are fickle and they'll turn on you like a pack of rabid hyenas. With that said, I've ultimately decided to keep my review at 5 stars simply because I know in my heart of hearts that this place is solid, and gosh darn it, I just like Eva and her staff THAT MUCH. Until next time...

Seriously, best electrician in Phoenix! I had just gotten back from vacation and was fervently laundering school clothes and cooking dinner for the chitlins when BOOM, I lose power in half of my appliances. My first response was: FREAK THE FREAK OUT! After all, two hungry kids and an entire refrigerator full of brand spanking new groceries going bad is NOT the way I wanted to end my glorious vacation week!  I checked the breakers and saw that one had tripped. After flipping every breaker I could, I realized that I was pretty much screwed. I called around to several reputable emergency electricians, but being that it was 9pm on a Saturday, they all wanted a $150 service fee ON TOP of the repair costs and regular call fees. Umm, no. So then I come across a gem of an electrician named Matt. Not only did he arrive in less than an hour from when I first made contact, but he had the issue resolved in minutes and for half the cost of just the service fees associated with most other "emergency" electricians. We are totally enamored with Apollo Electric and plan on using Matt for any and all future electrical repairs! I highly recommend Apollo Electric, and I will say that this has been the friendliest and most competitively priced electrician I have ever had the pleasure to hire in the Phoenix metro area!

Nook makes mouth happy. I've only been here for happy hour, but I'm pretty sure after today, I'll never happy hour at any other place ever again... First of all, Nook offers happy hour on Saturdays. Second, Nook is just has a really awesome vibe, and you can even watch the employees pull fresh mozzarella and bake handmade pizzas right at the bar. [There's something oddly erotic about watching a man pull pounds of fresh mozzarella... or I could just be really, really hungry...] The greatest thing about Nook's happy hour is that they don't change the portion sizes at happy hour just because the prices are halved. I can't tell you how much I HATE restaurants that do that. It's not actually a special if you're offering a half order at half price. Bastards. The portions are pretty epic - the arancini came 6 to an order and were sweet/savory, hot, cheesy, crunchy, and amazing; the poutine was definitely a dish to share (although I wish it had come with more gravy and more cheese curds); and the bruschetta came 4 pieces to an order. Ordering all of the three dishes above only set me back $17 at happy hour and was more than enough for two people to share. This place is AMAZE and I'm so happy we have yet another great culinary hotspot in Arcadia!

I love this place infinitely more than I would ever consider liking Joe's Crab Shack. But I don't love this place more than I love any of the fresh seafood shacks I grew up with in Ventura. Take that for what it's worth. Then order your boils with the "Trifecta" but MAKE SURE they add the corn and potatoes TO THE BAG because the seasoning is where it's at. (Corn, sausage, and potatoes are extra so ask for them!) I like my food spicy but I ordered level 2 as a compromise with my gringo husband - and honestly, level 2 was legit. They price by the pound and serve by the bag - the good stuff is on the bottom of the bag so don't be afraid to get dirty. I noticed that the fried goodies took twice as long to be served as boiled seafood, so if you're in a rush, I'd stay away from the fried menu. However, I was pretty happy with the calamari (which was a calamari steak cut into "fries") and hush puppies. Overall, it was a nice surprise to find in Mesa. Clearly, the seafood isn't fresh from the sea, but since we're stuck in Arizona - I'd definitely go back!

What an amazing dinner experience! I was excited by just the look of the restaurant, but didn't have the highest of hopes for the service or the food, as FRC restaurants are typically overpriced and hit or miss. I am pleased to report that The Henry exceeded my expectations on every level.   First off, Seth is the best server ever. Seriously, like EVER. It was my first time at The Henry and everything he recommended was pure gold. I started off with the fig and ginger mule. This is HANDS DOWN the BEST cocktail I have ever put in my mouth. For appetizers, we had the Brie toast and the popovers with ham butter and herb butter. The Brie was served on toasted, smokey bread with pears, hazelnuts, arugula, and pomegranate and it was amazing. The popovers were okay - maybe not as good as the popovers at BLT Steak, but the ham butter was really what made them stand out.   For dinner I had the Korean skirt steak. It wasn't my first choice but Seth recommended and I went with it. I was skeptical because I'm Korean, and frankly, Korean food in Arizona just isn't that good. The skirt steak was being served over fried rice - which caused me to make a face, but Seth PROMISED it was good, and it really, really was.   In fact, I had an "Anton Ego Eats Ratatouille" moment. It wasn't that the dish was the best I had ever had, but it tasted like something my grandmother would have made. Tomorrow, my grandmother would have been 95 years old and every bite of the fried rice on my plate just took me back to a childhood filled with dolsot bibimbap and kalbi. Frankly, the only thing missing was the kimchee, and I was tempted to run into the kitchen to see whose Korean grandmother they had hidden away back there.   After an incredible meal, I was talked into a croissant bread pudding laced with rum soaked raisins and warm deliciousness. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal, and a meal I would repeat again and again.

This review is specifically about the take-out service.   I can't speak to delivery or dining in, but as far as calling in an order and picking it up - this place was AMAZING! The staff was incredibly friendly and after they estimated a 20 minute wait time, my pizza was ready in 20 minutes ON THE DOT. I arrived to two hot pizzas with amazing flavor - a basic pepperoni and the Queen Margherita specialty pizza, which was packed with sliced Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and fresh garlic. SO DELICIOUS! Now, the crust is super bready, so if you're not a fan of thick, chewy crusts, this is not the place for you. I, however, LOVE thick, chewy crusts with big crispy brick oven bubbles throughout, so I was in pizza heaven. The 20" pizza was humongous and two of them fed three starving adults and three famished kids pretty easily - we even had half a pie left over.   This place is a great new addition to the Arcadia neighborhood and I can't wait to go back!

I didn't know what this place was, so I went with little to no expectations. I mean, sandwiched between a hot yoga studio, an herb shoppe, and a Whole Foods, I was actually thinking I'd be hungrier and poorer at the end of this evening. I mean - "grass" and "roots," right? Maybe we'd see something vegan? Something probably healthy? And definitely nothing I'd like. How refreshingly wrong I was!   There is complimentary valet up front, and even though it was a Friday evening, we were seated promptly. We had a small issue with my husband's wheelchair - it is oversized and just wouldn't fit through the front door or patio gate. That ticked me off a bit, but the interior of the restaurant was spacious and the excellent food and service more than made up to the bad start to our celebratory evening.   We started with a pitcher of white sangria, burrata, and pork belly. All amazing and large enough to share. If I had to only choose one - I'd definitely go burrata all the way, but the pork belly was a pig lover's paradise and I was perfectly happy scarfing down both orders. We ordered the baby back ribs and short ribs for the entrees, and although there was nothing wrong with the BBQ ribs, the hoisin short ribs with jalape√±o cheddar grits just made my night. For dessert, our server brought us a toffee brownie on the house, and it was pretty freaking amazing!   Overall, the ambience is lovely (complete with unfinished wood chairs and sand filled, candle holding mason jars), the food is terrific, and the service is simply top notch. One word of advice - if this is a slow, loungey, catch-up-with-friends type of evening, ask the server to space out the apps and the entrees. Our entrees arrived way too quickly (as we were only halfway through the apps) and it made for an awkwardly crowded dinner table... Regardless, we are thrilled to have Grassroots in the neighborhood and we will most definitely be back!

GOGI gets extra points for existing, for existing within a 3 mile radius of my home, for having barley tea (boricha), and for serving buckwheat noodles (naeng myun). Summers in my childhood home just weren't complete without boricha and naeng myun. The food was delicious - however, taste your broth before seasoning! I'm used to extremely bland broth and usually vinegar the crap out of it. GOGI either had very flavorful broth or very strong vinegar - but I probably won't know for sure until next time... The naeng myun wasn't what I was used to. It was topped with the traditional half boiled egg and thin slices beef, but instead of daikon radish, cucumber, and pear, GOGI used a pickled daikon radish (which was red like radish kimchee but not spicy) and black/white sesame seeds. I can't complain because it was all delicious. And my favorite part was that the noodles were cooked perfectly. My only gripe was that I wish they offered a kalbi + naeng myun combo option and I wish they also offered the option of extra noodles. My kid had some sushi and from what I tasted, it was okay. Nothing spectacular, but it's clear this restaurant's forte is Korean food and that sushi is simply an afterthought. The staff is kind but once it gets busy, they have a tendency to overlook you. Like, I'm still waiting here for a refill on my boricha and I totally had time to eat my entire meal and write this thoughtful critique...

Epic. That's the only word I can use to describe my dinner tonight. Amazing service, incredible food, best birthday dinner ever! There were a few mishaps along the way (like my breakfast burger missing it's bacon and egg... oh dear), but the chef more than made up for it in the end.  Happy hour is from 4-6pm and is always a fantastic deal at Ten. I recommend the cucumber gimlet and any of the appetizers, as they're all half off. Living Social is also offering a great deal on a dinner for two! Tonight, I had the hush puppies and the shrimp on grit cake. The hush puppies were perfectly crisp, topped with bacon and cheese crumbles, and served alongside a delicious remoulade. The shrimp and grit cake is definitely "crack on a plate," but don't forget to ask for bread service so you can sop up every drop of buttery goodness after the shrimp, sausage, tomatoes, and grit cake are long gone.  For the entrees, I ordered a breakfast burger and the pot roast. The burger was delicious but the pot roast was simply incredible. I told the chef that his pot roast was so amazing that I'd like to see it slapped on a grilled cheese sandwich in the future. As the meal wound down, the chef delivered a small plate to the table with two little triangles of pot roast grilled cheese. As full as I already was, I didn't care. I downed the grilled cheese and just about died. I thought my perfect meal was over when the server surprised me with a birthday PB&J a la mode for dessert. I mean, seriously???  As I rolled out of Ten a fat and happy birthday girl, I couldn't help but begin planning my next visit back. Perhaps next time I'll hassle the chef into making me a BLT with bacon, lettuce, fried green tomatoes, and that magical remoulade...

I can only attest to the take out, but so far - I love this place. Formerly Zaytoon Kabob Bistro - now ZK Grill - always SUPER YUM. Something about the ground beef and onion pur√©e kebabs with the charred tomato... Always gets right to me. You can get any meal prepared with no rice and pita - extra salad. And apparently the Italian dressing has the lowest carb content. It's a low carb dieter's paradise. The food was fresh and delicious and the service was incredibly friendly. From what I could tell while I was waiting, the establishment looked plenty clean. If I had to complain about anything - I wish there were more protein on the plate for the buck, but I've come to accept that if you want fresh and healthy food, you're gonna end up paying a few bucks more for it. Oh well! Definitely will be back for my beef combo plate - please don't ever go away...

I actually love AC2 more than AC1. AC2 is within walking distance from my house, doesn't have a 45 minute wait, and as at least one reviewer pointed out - serves noticeably bigger, juicier, and sweeter shrimp. Although snow crab and shrimp in trifecta is my typical go-to, I felt compelled to sample the deep fried soft shell crab and gumbo tonight. The gumbo was TOP NOTCH, but the soft shell crab wasn't as crispy as I thought it should have been. The staff informed me that next time, I could ask for my fried foods "extra crispy." Noted.   The wait staff was awesome and the food was delicious. The only reason I won't give in and rate AC2 the five stars they probably deserve is because they were out of hush puppies tonight. I mean, WTF. I just wanted gumbo and hush puppies for dinner and I couldn't - which really made me hangry... Although our excellent server introduced us to the lime/salt/pepper wonder dip, I'm still a little ticked about the hush puppies... *insert angry face here*  Lack of hush puppies aside, the portions and flavors and prices and service can't be beat. I hope AC2 does better than the previous three tenants of that restaurant space - we will watch and hope that they do.

Really nice staff and really tasty food - I just think that Mad Greens is so new that the kinks are still working themselves out, but that's to be expected.   The bad? Well, first... price and portion. For the price - the portions suck. And vice versa. But it's health food, so you can't be that upset; or surprised. Second, inexperience - but that will come with time.   The good? The food tastes great AND it's good for you. Mostly. I really enjoy the soups, the salads, and the wraps. The ingredients are fresh, the items are prepared to order (for you really picky bastards), and I can't get enough of the salted caramels.   If I had a single complaint - other than price - it would be that Mad Greens didn't tell me that I could have my salad as a wrap. I only saw this option on the website once I got back to work. DAMMIT PEOPLE! Give your customers the option of making their salad a wrap at the door. Or advertise this crap on your walls! Makes for a happy carbaholic! You know...? Perhaps this was the kink or inexperience, but it made me sad. Hence the removal of ONE STAR.

This place brings a genuine smile to my face. Nestled in a strip mall behind KFC and next to Food City - it appears unassuming and hidden behind the large "GRAND OPENING" banner obscuring the view of its entrance from the street. The sweet scents hit you from the doorway and any doubts melt away as the lovely Spanish couple who run this place rush to greet you. They are just as sweet as everything in the case they bake from scratch and as small business proprietors and a pair, they are winning at life.   All of the breakfast plates and paninis are a great deal at $5 and $6! I had the beef pastrami panini and was not disappointed. Juicy and well seasoned Italian beef pastrami layered on crispy but soft Italian focaccia with homemade pesto and melty European Swiss cheese - what's not to love? My kids had the ham and salami panini and the pizza panini which they gave 10 out of 5 stars (don't ask).   We also took home slices of tres leches cake, chocolate cake, and chocolate brownie for under $4 a piece. We were told that they were all baked fresh this morning and WOW, mind totally blown. Not overly sweet and very moist. Yep, I said it. MOIST. We can't wait to come back and try the milkshakes and other desserts. Sweet Desert is definitely a lovely hidden treasure to behold in our neighborhood!

Ladies and gentlemen - Stacy Phipps is BACK! And he takes credit cards now! Ever since Stacy's Smokehouse on Indian School disappeared, I've been wondering what had become of my second favorite Phoenix 'cue master. And now I know! The menu still echoes remnants of Stacy's traditional specialties - fried chicken, ribs, catfish, fried okra, collard greens... Some of the new comers include homemade hot links, rib tips, smothered pork chops, and fried green tomatoes.   My winners of the night? THE SERVICE, mac and cheese, sweet tea, the BBQ sauce, and homemade hot links. I could gorge myself on these items all night long. The mac here is al dente and cheesy beyond all my wildest hopes and dreams. The hot links BLEW MY MIND. And last but not least, the service was amazing.  I also ordered a rack of St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, brisket, fried green tomatoes, and fries. They've only been open a few weeks so obviously there are some growing pains here. The meats were a little dry and the tomatoes a little greasy - but we came at like 4pm on a Monday and I didn't expect smoked to order meats at this hour, so it wasn't a deal breaker. I think once business picks up or if you come during peak hours, this won't be an issue.   Tips for the future: get that liquor license, maybe serve a remoulade with the tomatoes, and bring back my fried pickles!!

Ladies and gentlemen - Stacy Phipps is BACK! Ever since Stacy's Smokehouse on Indian School disappeared, I've been wondering what had become of my second favorite Phoenix 'cue master. And now I know! The menu still echoes remnants of Stacy's traditional specialties - fried chicken, ribs, catfish, fried okra, collard greens... Some of the new comers include homemade hot links, rib tips, smothered pork chops, and fried green tomatoes.   My winners of the night? THE SERVICE, mac and cheese, sweet tea, the BBQ sauce (spicy and mild), fried okra, fried chicken, and homemade hot links. I could gorge myself on these items all night long. The mac here is al dente and cheesy beyond all my wildest hopes and dreams. Fresh, hot, juicy, crispy fried chicken served ALL DAY now. The hot links BLEW MY MIND. And last but not least, the service was simply amazing!  I also ordered a rack of St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, brisket, fried green tomatoes, and fries. They've only been open a few weeks so obviously there are some growing pains here. The meats were a little dry and the tomatoes a little greasy - but we came at like 4pm on a Monday and I didn't expect smoked to order meats at this hour, so it wasn't a deal breaker. I think once business picks up or if you come during peak hours, this won't be an issue.   One tip for the future, bring back the fried pickles!!

I don't profess to be an expert on Chinese food. I've never been to China, and I have no idea what food from Hong Kong is supposed to taste like. I just know that I like what I like and if I've had it somewhere before and it was good - that becomes my measuring stick. With that said, I didn't totally love this place. The service was excellent and the staff is incredibly sweet and attentive, but some of the food fell a little short for me and I was truly torn between three and four stars. I think the fact that I loved my entree and dessert and that the staff was so on point is what pushed my review toward 4 stars in the end.  We started with the scallion pancakes, which were dry and flaky. Once again, I'm not an expert but the Taiwanese place at Mekong has the best scallion pancakes and I guess I'm used to chewy but crispy and a little greasy. Also, they don't serve it with a dipping sauce here which is a detriment because as dry as the pancake was, a sauce on the side might have helped. Thank goodness for the chili oil at the table - it was some of the best I've ever had and totally saved the day!  My dinner consisted of salt and pepper pork chops. I loved it. It was topped with an onion and garlic mixture instead of the traditional peppers and scallions, but I loved the addition of garlic. My daughter ordered the orange chicken (so adventurous) and it was TERRIBLE. I can't explain it but the sauce tasted like liquid cotton candy, and not in a good way. They also use white and dark meat, so some of the pieces had skin, fat, or cartilage. My kid is a discerning eater and was not impressed.   We ended with coconut snow (shaved ice) with condensed milk and strawberries and the Thai black sticky rice with mango and vanilla. Both were clearly winners and the overall dinner was saved!
