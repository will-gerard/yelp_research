We went this past Saturday with my sister-in-law and her husband.  She works in the area and suggested we go to dinner here.   I was extremely pleased with our meal.  We started with Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and Boiled Won Tons.  The egg rolls were crispy and flavorful, the pot stickers were plump and the filling was delish, but the star for me was the boiled won tons.  I have never had anything like them, They were packed full of meat and served in this savory peanut flavored broth. My sister-in-law was a little wary of trying one, but she did and concurred that they were quite good.  She is not the most adventurous eater so that is really saying something!  For our main courses we  shared Mongolian Beef, Peking Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and Sichuan Beef.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, The Peking Shrimp had a spicy red sauce the had a little tang to is and was served with snow peas (nice and crunchy not over cooked) and onions.  The salt and pepper shrimp were fried with a nice light batter that was salty but not over done and the jalapeno peppers were just right.  The Sichuan  Beef was my least favorite, I thought the sauce made the batter a little soggy but I really liked that sauce so was still a good dish.  The portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as were my dinner companions, so we took a lot of our dinner home, and it tasted great the next day.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up our leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.  From the outside the restaurant doesn't really look like much, a sand colored stucco building, but inside it is furnished and decorated nicely, the tables are spaced  so that you don't feel crowded and the lighting was bright but not overly so.  My only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there.

Worst store of any kind ever. There was one girl working at the guest service counter (she was the only one that was actually doing something), but the other 2 male employees were not helpful at all.   One was on an obviously personal phone call and seemed to be annoyed that a customer might need some help, the other tried to help but had no knowledge of the products that were in the store.    We never did find what we were looking for, but were going to purchase some other items.  When we went to check out there were no cashiers, we waited for 10 minutes while the staff goofed off.  We never were able to check out.  When we left the products on the counter and started to leave they told us to have a nice day, they were oblivious to the fact that they lost a sale..  Can't believe that a store with such incompetent and rude staff is still in business.

Went on a drive last fall with the parents and stopped in here. Cute little diner with a very friendly staff.  The food was good and we all enjoyed our meals.   One of the waitresses noticed our dog in the car and offered us some water to give her, nice touch.

Awful customer service. At first I was just trying to get a panel and brace for a door I bought from them a few years ago. After calling numerous times and being promised a call back which I never received,  I finally decided maybe it would be better to have them come look at the door.  I was told that I would need to be available between  1 - 4 pm and that the service guy would  call 30 minutes prior to coming, well 3:30 rolled around then 3:45 so I called the office, the guy there told me it was the owner out on the calls and he must be running late, I asked how long he rudely said"I dunno" I asked if he could find out, he seemed completely put out that I'd want to know the time they would be there.  So the owner calls and goes into this tirade about how he's on his way and early, I told him he wasn't early he was supposed to have called 30 minutes before coming and be there by 4 so since he hasn't called by 3:30, I had been worried about him showing up on time, that was my only concern. He started on some rampage of absolute BS, that I was being rude and shouldn't have complained to his office person, I told him his office person was rude, then this guy really went off, I told him he better check his rude attitude before coming to my house, he said he wasn't coming, which figures since they have no concept of timelessness or customer service.  Don't do businesses with these hotheads.  They are wound too tight to trust on your home, I'm actually glad the guy decided not to show up, because you never know what can happen with unstable individuals like him.

Service - sketchy...um appetizers are served BEFORE the entree not AFTER. Seems they bring the food out as it is cooked, but the cook has no timing. Some were eating the soup course while others had nothing then some had entrees and the other soup was served, all in all a mess.  Food- OK nothing to write home about, but I did have an awful stomach ache most of the night after eating here. No one else did, I was the only one who had the General Tso chicken though so the verdict is still out.  Would I return, probably not, but others in our party like the place so they probably will.

Always heard great things about this place so I was really looking forward to eating here.  I took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed.  The waitress/owner seated us and then sat down and had a 10 minute conversation with someone at another table, when she finished she came over and took our order.  The food was bland and under-seasoned. My gyro tasted like one of those pre-made frozen ones you put on the spit and serve at the county fair.    The funniest thing was my mom is a vegetarian and under their "Vegetarian Specialties" category on the menu they have one item listed as containing chicken broth...well maybe they think of vegetarian as not having big chunks of meat...who knows.  She was not a fan of the hummus she had or the Greek salad. How can you mess up a Greek salad? Serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing, that's how.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars was my dad said the Souvlaki dish he had was OK. I had a taste of it and thought it was a bit bland and greasy, but he seemed to enjoy it.  I would skip this place and go elsewhere as there are much better Greek restaurants in the Phoenix area.

Heavy sauces, bland dishes and so-so service.  I really wouldn't call Olive Garden an Italian Restaurant, its a chain that serves Americanized  dishes loosely based on recipes that might have an Italian ingredient or two in them.  The soup was cold, our food was served lukewarm and the service was slow.  I suppose if you only ordered the salad and bread-sticks it might be worth going to.  It's sad because the menu items sound good but they are just so poorly executed it's just not worth wasting your time here.

Friendly staff and Thrifty Ice cream make this a great place to fill up your water jugs.  I love their ice, so clean and clear.  They also carry the 5 gallon water jugs with the built in handle, I have purchased a couple of them and they are the best.

Some of the best dogs around.  Been eating them since 1980 when I went to Glendale High.   Tonight I was disturbed to see on the news that a car had run through the side of the building.  Hope everyone is OK, and it doesn't hinder buisness too much because Glendale wouldn't be Glendale without Dazzo's

You can't argue with a restaurant that has been around for almost 60 years.  I believe if you asked my parents I've eaten here since before I can remember.    The food is always good and the service friendly and efficient.  I love just about everything on the menu and it's hard to pick a favorite, if I had to it would probably be the San Marcos Enchiladas.  Pedro's is just a great place to go when you want good Mexican food that is not messed up by fads and trends.

We  were always pleased with our meal, and the service is impeccable.  Many of the star-chef restaurants in Vegas are not up to par, but since Rick Moonen is actually present in his restaurant, the standards are top notch.  We  have eaten both upstairs and downstairs. I  love the tasting menus in the more formal upstairs.   If you  love seafood it is a great experience.   My hubby likes the more informal downstairs and eating a  couple orders of the oyster sampler and a beer.  The option of more formal or casual is nice since sometimes you just want a casual dinner and other times it's nice to  splurge.  We've had the chance to chat with Rick a  couple of times on our visits, and he  and the staff  always make sure our dining experience is special.  We always stay at Mandalay when we are in Vegas so RM has become one of our favorites.

I don't know what they do to their asparagus, but I wish I could take a couple hundred pounds of it home.    The truffle Mac-n-cheese....devine! My  husband and I  took the leftover Mac-n-chesse  back to our room at the Mandalay  and fought over who should get it later that night.    The bread basket..soooo good.  Oh yeah they serve entrees too...some of the best steaks my husband and I ever tasted.  The service was exceptional. Be sure to spend some time on the bar patio, the view is great.

Great patio for an afternoon lunch.  We took our dogs and the wait staff was very nice to them, they bought a large bowl of water right away and made sure we had plenty of shade.  The food was great, We started with stuffed mushrooms, the sausage stuffing in them was terrific and we really enjoyed them, I had the Sauerbraten and my husband had the Paprika Schnitzel for our entrees. Both were flavorful and tasty and the portions were quite large. We did manage to save enough room to split a dessert and had the bread pudding, it was delicious.  Can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings.

Yes you may have to wait during the rush, but it is well worth the wait.  I've never had a bad meal here. Hubby and I like to come during the off hours, (2am) because there usually is no line.  The pan roasts are excellent and the service is great. It's fun watching 2-3 people create yummy seafood greatness in such a small area. It is like watching a well choreographed dance at times.  The late night oyster specials are a good deal too!

We went on the Vegas Lights Tour and it was thrilling.  Everything was top notch, from the pick-up to the check-in to the flight.  The views were spectacular and the flight was really smooth.  It was much less scary than my husband and I anticipated since this was our first helicopter flight.  We can't wait to hop aboard again for a longer tour, maybe the Grand Canyon.

I have only had breakfast here but it was really good.  I was very impressed with the service, promptly seated, quick with the coffee and refills, and the food was served piping hot.  They have a nice variety of omelets on the menu so that's what we went for.  I had the Mediterranean and my mom had the senior cheese one.  Both were cooked perfectly, my was very tasty with kalmata olives, spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  My mom said she loved that they used sharp cheddar in hers not bland American cheese like most restaurants use.  I don't know about other Coco's in the valley but this one is great.

If there was a way to rate it 0, I would. I was tagging along with my sister-in-law who wanted to get a new phone. The 1st obstacle is that you now have to pay full price for phones, but she knew that going in.  The problem was the store clerk could not answer the most basic of questions. "It's there a trade in value on my old phone" answer "maybe", "can I switch the SIM card from my old phone to the new one and get a new SIM card for the old phone and still use the old phone" Answer "possibly"   Honestly every question was answered "maybe" or "possibly" we never got a straight answer from her. It was like T-Mobile pulled her off the street and put her in front of the register.  When visiting the t-mobile store you expect them to know something about your account and your options, I'd expect this from Wal-Mart where they have different carriers being represented, but the clerk's at Wal-Mart were much better when we added a phone a couple of months ago.  T-Mobile may have better plan pricing but there is no way I'd ever switch after seeing the lack customer service the provide.

AYCE is the way to go.  The selections are great too, not just sushi rolls, lots of interesting things to try.  I like that they have half-rolls so you can try different ones without filling up on just one item.  We go here every time we are in Vegas, it's worth getting off the strip to come here.

I don't drink beer but I love the food here.  Everything on the menu, and I mean EVERYTHING is great!   I especially like that they have "Gardein" vegetarian selections.  I have friends that are vegetarians so it is nice that  we can go somewhere and they are not stuck with just a salad or a baked potato.  The service is spot on, and the wait staff is knowledgeable of their menu and can answer any question.  I make a stop here every time I'm in the valley.

Really great Thai food, nice green papaya salad and the way they make their tofu dishes is super, I don't know if it is the crinkle cut they use on the tofu, or some other cooking technique, but it was exceptional.  The veggies were cooked perfectly, not too crisp not too mushy and the spice level was just right.

I love this hotel, from the excellent service to the plush room everything was top-notch!  We booked the Tower Suite through mLife and could not have been more pleased. We were on the 53rd floor which provided excellent views.  The room was to die for, spacious and comfortable.  It had 2 large flat screen TV's and a small one in the bath area, comfortable seating in a living area and a dining area that had a wet bar and an extra refrigerator (separate from the minibar) which made saving the leftovers from Aria's excellent restaurants a breeze.  The bedroom area was spacious and the bed was super comfy.  The pillows were the things dreams are made of...literally, I never had such sweet dreams.  The bath area, well it was the best I have ever had in a hotel.  Large dressing area, whirlpool tub, separate shower with a bench, large closet, and a toilet that well let's just say it was a magical toilet and leave it at that.  The assorted chocolates left at the evening turn-down service we really good as  well as the turn-down, everything laid out, room refreshed, everything tidied up, so nice to return to, the service was above and beyond.  I also appreciated the Aria's attention to security, some may see having to show your key when entering the guest room elevator area a hassle, but having stayed at less secure MGM properties (Mandalay Bay to be exact) and seeing the problems of lax security I appreciate the attention to guests safety and security.  This is our new go to hotel when visiting Vegas.

Loving the Loving Hut, is that redundant?  Who knew vegan could be so good?  I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, I just like food, and the dishes here could almost make me consider changing my meat eating ways.  I love the Mongolian Wonder,  Spicy Pad Thai, and the Golden  Delight, a lemongrass 'chikn'.  Then there is the broth they give you at the start of the meal, it's a light and flavorful broth with a few vegetables  and a  little tofu in it, so simple yet oh so tasty.  The atmosphere is so relaxing and you feel better having eaten a meal here. I can't wait to get back to the valley and try something else on their extensive menu.

We ate at the bar and couldn't have been more pleased.  The bartender was excellent, and the food was delish!   We finished our meal with Absinthe Russian Style, if you have never had it this way, it is something to behold. From the flaming liquor being poured to inhaling the alcohol vapors out of the glass, it was an experience.

We really enjoyed this restaurant. Even though it is in the Aria and on the Strip the prices were very reasonable and the food was excellent.  We started with Chicken Satay and Shrimp Rolls both were excellent.  For our entree I had the Papaya Salad and hubby had the Pho.  Both were seasoned well and very tasty.  We were a little disappointed when they didn't have Prik Nam Pla, a chili and fish sauce condiment, but the waitress was very accommodating and had the kitchen staff make us some.  No Thai dish is really complete without it and if you haven't tried it you really should.

AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH, That was relaxing.  Loved the salt room, I'd been having some respiratory problems over the past year and sitting in this room certainly helped.  Wish I could have brought it home with me.  The outdoor therapy pool was great too, nice views and co-ed, as were many of the facilities (Salt Room, Hot Stone Room) which is nice because my husband and I rarely get to enjoy a spa experience together.  I even talked my hubby into a couples mani-pedi which to his surprise he really enjoyed.  The manicurist was great and made him feel comfortable and relaxed.  It would have been extra nice if the front desk clerk had kept her mouth shut about the price in front of my hubby since it was a present and had taken the reservation correctly in the first place. But even given the sub-par receptionist the services and the professional staff deserve more than 5 stars.    I would suggest if you are doing a special day or group that you check in with them the day before to make sure your reservations are correct and the front desk doesn't ruin anything since they lack class and etiquette.

For a burger joint, this is as good as it gets.  I especially loved the large selection of specialty sodas.  They also have the best chili cheese fries, I have never had better chili, it was meaty and tasty and best of all not greasy!  I will definitely go back when we are in the area.

Nice dog park.  Separate areas for large and small dogs.  Once in a while there is a bad owner (no bad dogs) who doesn't keep a close eye on their dog or pick up it's poop (There are scoopers and bags available so there is NO EXCUSE!) but overall most people obey the rules and its a fun crowd.

Great service, super pieces, and they stand by their product and installation. My elderly father and mother had a problem with their door and even though they had  misplaced their paperwork, Legends fixed the door promptly...it was a bad circuit board. We figured since it had been around a year since the installation we'd be charged something, but they covered everything. They are absolutely the best in the valley, I'd tried a couple of others before finding them...complete disasters. But LEGENDS out-performed them all, GREAT COMPANY, I highly recommend them.

Oh how I wish I had come here sooner. I don't hand out 5 stars for restaurants very often, but Fuego deserves it, shoot they deserve 6 but there isn't a way to do that.  We started with guacamole, it was perfect, slightly chunky, not overdone, just great avocados and perfectly seasoned.  For lunch I had the Pernil Asado tacos, scrumptious! They were served with the best rice and black beans ever made.  My mom had the vegetarian tacos, and 6 hours later she is still going on about how great they were.    Our server, Alex, made the meal, she was so sweet and attentive, our chips were promptly refilled, our tea never ran out, it was a pleasure to be her customers, she was just that good!!!!!  I will be back as soon as I can get there!    I was also happy to here that the other Fuego restaurants have patio seating which is dog friendly (call ahead) so I can take my poochies with me when I visit the other location.

I think I am going to coin a new term for this type of "mexican" food: WASP-Mex.  It's where restaurants take mexican food and what they think is Mexican decor and put an anglo spin on it.   I know some people like it and that's ok for them, but for an authentic experience Phoenix and the rest of the valley offer so much more.  When I went I had a green chicken enchilada and taco. The flavor was bland and lacked other seasoning too. The green chiles tasted canned, the corn tortilla was tough, and the taco was greasy.  It was just not good.  I find it sad because Mexican food has so many regional varieties and wonderful types of cuisine to choose from, but this type of restaurant really bastardizes the food and flavors that deserve to be among some of the world's best cuisines.

Excellent service and great pricing. This was our 1st time using Bulwark and they were great. Making the appointment was fast and easy and the technician, Seth, was on time and very professional.  He thoroughly explained the chemical they use and took the time to find out what our main problems are and came up with a plan that should have us bug free in no time.  Seth was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable, during each step he took the time to explain what he was doing and what the effects of the insecticides would be.

I'm not a big country or chain restaurant fan so I wasn't expecting to like this restaurant, but I REALLY LIKE THIS RESTAURANT!  From the shelled peanuts in a bucket at the table; to the line dancing in the aisles; to the delicious food; it's all a lot of fun and a great experience.  The service is exceptional, the employees really seem to like working there.  They are energetic, friendly and helpful.  The food is great, Love the dinner rolls!!!  I wasn't expecting the salmon to be anything special, but I must admit it is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had, cooked perfectly and seasoned properly, it really doesn't get much better.  I also like that it's a place I can take everyone in my family.  My mom's a vegetarian, my dad hard to please and other family members have some diet restrictions, but the menu is flexible enough to accommodate everyone.  The servers know their stuff too, so special requests are not a problem and they know what is in their food so dietary restrictions questions are confidently answered.  It's a good time, with good food, and a fun atmosphere.

I've quickly become a Kimpton junkie, all of their hotels are pet friendly so we don't have to leave our "babies" at home.  Palomar Cityscape is a lovely property with a great location.  My hubby and "babies" visited here for the annual Dbacks Bark in the Park event and we had a wonderful experience at the hotel.  The staff was lovely and attentive. The room was spacious and very comfortable and the rooftop pool was beautiful.  The next time we are in town we will definitely stay here.

It is never pleasant going to the doctor when you are sick, especially when you are out of town and sick, but the staff at NextCare made being sick almost enjoyable.  They were prompt, attended to my every need and made sure the medicine I needed could be purchased at the best price.  The internet check-in is a big plus, no waiting in the office they call you when they are ready for you to come in...WOW  Their follow up was prompt and courteous too.   I wish my regular doctor's office were run this well.

The only reason we go to this O'reilly's is because it is convenient.  The counter staff is slow as molasses, we have seen people walk out because its so slow.  They also do not know the difference between a customer on the phone and one standing in front of them, phone calls can be put on hold, paying customers should be waited on and allowed to pay and be on their way.

As with any Cirque show this one does not disappoint.  This show is based on a closed down circus acts who are putting on one last show.  The variety of acts was impressive, from the ball bouncer, ring spinning things, hilarious clowns, tight rope walkers, to the flag throwers, and then there is the Wheel of Death...WOW!  The music was fascinating, they speak in some unintelligible language, but that adds to the fantasy.  We heard some people complaining behind us, but get a life, it's a FANTASY, relax and enjoy.  The seating in the theater was great too, we were in these sofa like chairs that were so comfy and spacious, much different from other theaters, it was great!

The food was so good it was gone before I had a chance to take pictures...oops!  I really like Otro,  their food is fresh, flavorful, and made with quality ingredients.  I went in search of a good taco al pastor, and while theirs missed the mark of a truly authentic one, the taste and flavor of the taco here was very good.  (BTW I'm still in search of a taco al pastor that tastes as good as the ones I came to love in central Mexico so if anyone knows of a good taco shop send me a message)  Now on to what is really good...the Inca salad, I could eat buckets of it.  The sofrito rice is another of my favorites, perfectly cooked and perfectly spiced.  Elote Callejero - roasted corn with cheese and paprika...in a word YUM!!!  I can't wait to return and try more.

Love the quick pick-up slice station. It's great for picking up a delicious slice on your way back up to your room.  Nice to have choices on a single slice other than pepperoni or cheese. The Forager and Blanca were some of the best slices I ever had.  Terrific crust and tasty toppings!

They wanted elite Yelpers to participate, never corresponded or replied to many of our applications. About 40 food trucks promised...They were 32 short. Some food vendors just had booths but there were only a dozen or so food vendors out of the 40 to 50 promised.  Event organizers are a joke, samples promised with pre-sale packages...not all vendors participated so choices were very limited and some of those claimed they ran out of samples. Vendors were supposed to only accept tokens/tickets...it was some cash, some credit, some wouldn't honor pre-purchsed tickets/tokens. A complete mess with no accountability taken by the event management.  There were supposed to be express lines, but the event organizers didn't hand out the arm bands to the express ticket holders because of low attendance. That didn't stop some rude people from jumping line even though they were told the express line wasn't being honored. It was causing a few squabbles in lines and left vendors not knowing how to handle the situation  Unorganized and over-promised, typical Glendale event. I don't know where the City of Glendale gets these event organizers but they couldn't organize an outhouse let alone a supposedly major food festival.
