These guys are great! Absolutely stunning pieces and great prices! Extremely friendly and very easy to get along with. Feel very comfortable shopping for all my holiday gifts here. Fantastic women's pieces as well as men's pieces. Not to mention beautiful men rings and promise/engagement rings!

Drove 45 mins to the stadium to buy tickets for this upcoming super cross. Got there and had a lady by the name of Kim at the ticket counter.  Kim apparently either hates her life or was having a really bad day bc she was the rudest most inconsiderate person I have had help me at a ticket booth.  I will be purchasing tickets online from now on. Not saying I'm going to boycott this arena bc of this one experience... but rather just figured I should share just in case her boss wants to check up and make sure she's doing a good job. UGH!!! whatever I'm done venting now... goodnight!

Pretty good place overall. Only have been here a couple times but the vibe is good and lively. Their food is good and service is pretty on spot.

This is the best car wash in the valley... So cheap and they have free vacuums if you are like me and don't like random strangers in your car! Always nice staff and never had any problems. Two thumbs up!!!

I bought laminate flooring for my summer home from here. I had to have gotten 10 quotes from other companies and this place had the best pricing by far.  I had a very nice and knowledgeable sales associate helping me. (Justin) Justin really went above and beyond to meet my needs.  Thank you guys again!!  If you are looking for a place to get flooring, I 100% would recommend Flooring Direct.

I had my first Crossfit class this morning.  Everybody was extremely nice and treated me like family.  Being my first time I was completely unaware of how to do ANYTHING but the instructors were extremely easy to understand and extremely knowledgeable.  I will be going back next week and making this a 3 times a week kinda thing. Can't wait to get my hot beach body on for summer!!! lol  Oh also... They had a kids club for you moms and dads out there.  Seemed very convenient for parents.
