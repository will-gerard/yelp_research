The food and wine was amazing but there is one reason we will not return.  Midway through my meal I was really ready for another glass of the yummy cab I was drinking from Napa but the line to get another glass was so long and my food would have gotten cold if I would have waited.  If this restaurant was sit down with wait staff I would be there all the time.  Amazing food, great wine, poor concept.

Forget reading all reviews and just go!!!  This place is awesome!!!  My husband is culinary trained and it's hard to find a restaurant where he is happy to spend his money.  Well this is one of the very few.  Every plate of food we have had in the place has been delicious.  You can tell it is family ran because you can taste the love and the joy of cooking in the food.  And the dessert.... there are just no words so order it or if you are full take it home with you.  I am so glad we found this place!!!
