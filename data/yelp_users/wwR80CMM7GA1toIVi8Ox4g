We had actually gone to Chodang originally and after standing there for a few minutes without being acknowledged by the 3 employees that walked by numerous times, we walked out and went to Takamatsu. Best decision ever! This place is awesome! Not only is the food (Korean bbq) amazing, but the staff is so friendly and efficient. EVERYONE takes care of you!

I have to give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because after having Arawan Thai, no place else deserves 5 stars. I think the dishes at Lotus of Siam are great, but sometimes can be tendon or Fatty like. The flavors are awesome though and we always receive our food quickly. A must try is the crispy rice on the appetizers!  The menu is so huge I don't know where to start, but I love a big selection,  so I'm not complaining!

So hubby and I were having a date night and we just stopped in here on a whim.  What luck! The sushi was very fresh and they had so many on the menu that it was hard to choose! The service was great.  They were all really attentive and very nice!  I can't wait to go back and try all the other sushi that we missed out on.

I love this place and I will never see another dentist ever again! (Unless dr. Howie retires :-) I started coming here a few years ago and had so many issues, that I was embarrassed, but doctor howie made me feel so comfortable. He even made extra accommodations because he knew I was afraid of the dentist! well  I'm not afraid anymore! But about a year and a half ago, I tried another dental office because my friend worked there and convinced me to try her office. ..I had to go back to Seville!  No other place compares.  The staff is also very friendly and I always feel like we can chat for hours. Take it from me,  you won't regret it!  oh,  and they also have tv's on the ceiling that you can watch while being treated.  You don't even have to fight anyone for the remote! !! It's awesome.

I'm really picky about Thai food because I grew up eating it almost every day.  We ordered take out so maybe they were just in a hurry because the girl on the phone told me it would be 5 to 10 minutes.  I got the beef salad.  Very dry and bland.  Same with the larb. My husband wasn't fond of his massamun curry either. Said his was bland too. Bummed because I'm on a hunt for a really good Thai place! Giving at least 2 stars because staff was friendly and prices were very reasonable. If I was basing it on just food, would only be 1 star:(

Well, I definitely won't be back to this place. I should have read the reviews before coming here. Shame on me! The pho was mediocre. It wasn't horrible, but it was on the sweeter side, and the thin sliced meat was actually a little too thick for pho. The Thai basil I was given was mostly bruised and wilted, but I managed to get a few good pieces. Service was horrible.  After dropping off my soup, the server NEVER returned to my table.  Not to check on me. Not to ask if everything was OK. Not to refill my soda. Not even to drop of my bill! At one point,  I tried to straighten in my seat and when I used the table as leverage,  it leaned and spilled my soup because it was wobbly. I motioned to the server so that I could ask for napkins. She looked right through me. I ate the remainder of my meal with soup all over the table.  She even sat at a table in the dining area and ate her own meal.  That's fine,  but she should have made sure all her customers were taken care of beforehand. I was one of three tables sat in the restaurant. No excuse. A few times she looked at me and saw me literally staring at her. She never got up.  I finally went to the counter and asked another employee for my bill. She was very pleasant,  but I had witnessed her rolling egg rolls in the dining area and touching menus and chairs and helping a couple look through the menu. I never saw her go to wash her hands. Save yourself the irritation.  Go somewhere else.  There are so many other places that have great pho and good service!

Love this little dive! Crab Benedict is to die for!  Been here 2 or 3 times,  but each time it seems like we are getting smoked out or like they are chopping onions. Our eyes start to water.  No worries!  They have a patio.  Food is awesome and service is very quick, so the onion thing is a small price to pay. Lol

If I could give zero stars , I would.  This location has by far the rudest employees. I've been numerous times and never been greeted or asked if I could even be helped. I've even witnessed managers barking orders at employees and never once gave me a 2nd glance.  There's also some sour faced employee who restocks merchandise and comes within 2 inches of me with her cart,  expecting me to move out of her way,  but never says excuse me. I still went back after that because they have a lot of the things I need.  This day was different though.  Amanda,  a cashier,  was ringing my purchase. had my husband and 4 year old with me,  so I had him do a separate transaction in order to use another coupon.  I was buying 3 of the same banner in one transaction and Amanda says to me, 2 of your 3 banners are marked at $9.99 and the 3rd is $11.99, do you still want it? I reply,  "yes,  I need 3 in order to fit in the space I want.  Don't you just ring it at the lower price since they are all the same?"  She tells me that one is probably new stock that they mark them up.  Now I'm annoyed.  Any other place you go to would give the lower price.  (Why do I have to check the tag on every item I buy if they're all the same? ) I tell her to ring them all at $9.99 and I'll go grab another one and show it to her as I walk out the door.  She continues with the transaction and when she gives me the total,  I ask if that is with all 3 banners,  she replies, "no only 2,  just in case there are none left at $9.99". So I say,  "so if there is, then I have to wait in line again? ". She rolls her eyes and says very snottily, "uh, I'll pull you to the front of the line! " so instead of offering to have another employee retrieve one for me,  I have to go get it myself.  I go back and wouldn't you know my luck,  they only have $11.99 ones.  I go to the front and she has a long line and after she helps her current customer,  I start to speak and she holds up her index finger and shouts to Chelsea if she can call another cashier to"help this customer". I ask Chelsea for the 3rd banner and she gets it from their restock pile and tells me she didn't think I wanted it.  Shirley,  the additional cashier comes up,  and I tell Chelsea that at any other store,  they would honor the lower price.  She says that's just our "policy". I didn't realize until it escalated, but when Shirley started to ring me up,  I go to use another coupon on my phone and Chelsea, listening in, turns to me with a ,"gotcha!" Smirk on her face and informs me that I cannot use a coupon.  I ask why and she replies, " because you already used a coupon and it's one coupon per customer,  per day".  I ask her,  "is that why you're still here easedropping? So you can shame me? ! Forget the fact that I've already been inconvenienced! And how would you even know I used a coupon anyway?" She said it was the cashier's job to let them know when someone used a coupon.  Yeah right! Obviously Amanda and Chelsea gossiped about me as soon as I went to grab another item and decided to try to upset me further. We had more words and I stormed out.  Called a manager and she was pleasant,  but didn't offer any type of reconciliation.  Will never return.  Shady business practice and rude employees! And all over $2

Too small. Not many rides. Even my 4 year old said she was kinda bored. Staff wasn't rude nor were they friendly. Seemed like they were just going through the motions. The place also looks run down.  Went to the restaurant on site after our time was up.  Not much of a selection and after waiting for a few minutes and no one showing up, we just left the establishment. Next time I'll take my little one to jumpstreet.

I will actually never return to this location again.  Second bad experience here,  but this one was worse & before we even got a chance to sit down.  We were on a waiting list and since there was no where to sit, we decided to wait outside. An employee (we'll call her l.m., since those were the initials on her hat), finished with her shift came outside and started calling a cab.  She was obviously annoyed with him because when she got off the phone,  she proceeded to call him a mother f*&$@&. A patron she apparently was friendly with went to talk to her and she used the term again to tell her story about the cab driver. We moved away so we didn't have to hear her language.  (Had our 4 year old with us). He asked her to come inside and when she walked by us,  she used the f":$@ word again.  I said "hey, come on." And pointed to my daughter and instead of actually apologizing,  gave me a back handed response.  This was what she said,  "I'm sorry,  I work at a bar,  I don't cater to families and kids." i told her,  "they have a kids menu which makes it a family restaurant." Her response, "I'm sorry you're so offended,  but I'm off work and I don't have kids,  so I don't need to watch my mouth". My husband said to her that since she's still wearing the uniform,  then she's still on the clock.  I went inside and told the hostess to cancel our table since this young lady walking by doesn't care to watch her mouth. The original girl,  says to me that she's actually a manager and I laugh and say really? ! I can't believe that you're a manager! She insists that she's already apologized , we had a few more words and when I walked out,  she yells,  "wow!" I said,  "yes,  I was thinking the exact same thing! "

What kid likes to go to the dentist? My kid, that's who! Dr Steve and all the other employees are always so friendly and knowledgeable. They really know how to treat kids. My daughter's never afraid, and of course she always leaves with tons of goodies. A toothbrush, toothpaste, water bottle, dental floss, and even a toy from their treasure chest.  And to top it all off, they always have a Disney movie playing while you're waiting and even on the ceilings while your kid is getting their check up! Trust me, this is the place to take your kids for their dental needs.

This place is very tiny, and although it was full,  it didn't feel too crowded. We were greeted and also sat immediately. We ordered the all meat pizza on a thin crust and added Canadian bacon. I have to say,  this was probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  They really piled on the ingredients.  I didn't think that was possible on a thin crust,  but it held up pretty well because the crust was perfectly crisp! Our server was nice, but I had to remind her when she forgot a few things.  Not a problem! It happens. Plus she made up for it by being so sweet.  We ended up sitting next to a few sheriff's deputies and bought their meal.  Had a great experience when I was pulled over by one,  and wanted to pay it forward!  Because of yelp, I want to try other pizza places,  but I'm afraid they won't stack up.  I want pizza tonight,  but I'm so conflicted! Go to a guaranteed winner? Or try a new place? What to do? !

This place is a hidden gem! The service was awesome.  Becky was so sweet and accomodating.  We ordered oyster shooters. Strong, but yummy! Had to do it. Also got the the shrimp cocktail and it was very fresh. My husband ordered the sea bass and I ordered the halibut.  Prepared very similiar...Only difference was the type of fish and the cream sauce.  He had a lemon sauce.  I had a lobster sauce.  Other than that,  they both were accompanied by risotto and grilled asparagus.  We were both happy with our dishes.  Loses one star because for a seafood place,  I feel the fish should be prepared perfectly,  but mine was a little over cooked. The chocolate martinis, however, were so good that I had three of them.  Needless to say,  we enjoyed our visit and will be back again!

I really love this place.  It's so clean and the food is really yummy!  I've been here 3 times ,so far, and the people running the registers are always pleasant. The last girl I encountered was very cheery! That's the kind of person I love seeing at the front counter!  Nothing worse than dealing with someone that has no customer services skills. Even if they were clueless,  a smile on their face can make all the difference! Both times I've gotten the blackberry jasmine tea & the tri tip bowl with forbidden rice and roasted veggies. It came out quickly and was sooooo goooood! I'm actually craving it right now,  so you know where I'll be for lunch today!

It was a few minutes after 3pm on a Tuesday.  They should have been closed,  but a man, I assume was the owner, let us in anyway!  And after browsing the to go menu,   I realize I'm right because his picture is on it. Lol. This place is tiny, but they have a huge menu to choose from.  It was a hard,  but I chose the gnocchi and meat sauce.  Did not disappoint!  The gnocchi was cooked perfectly and I'm sure the meat sauce was made from scratch! My husband got the meatball sub on homemade bread. He also enjoyed his meal. I tried the meatball and it was really tasty! Carlo (the owner), also added to the ambience, by singing something Italian, while cooking. We'll definitely be back!  Just had it yesterday for lunch,  and I'm already craving it for dinner today!

This place is great! The food portions are huge and the service was quick.  I ordered the border Benedict and it was exactly what I was hoping for! My stepsons ordered the French toast and the chicken fried steak. They are both picky eaters, And they both loved their meals. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars, is because the decor looks pretty dated. I was leery when we first walked in because it reminded me of a Denny's or a village inn, but the food really impressed us! They even gave us a complimentary crepe  for mine and my stepson's birthday. We will definitely be back.

We happened upon this place while on our way to lotus of Siam. (Which was closed). While doing a U turn in the plaza, we spotted Arawan. This place is amazing! Not as much of a selection as Lotus of Siam, but the dishes we had were so much better! The ambience is nice. The decor is elegant. And the staff is very attentive. We had the stuffed wings and I would highly recommend those! The beef salad was awesome too! You can tell they use very high quality ingredients. I want to try everything on the menu! Can't wait to come back during our annual trip!

So as soon as we were greeted,  I guess I started getting a little annoyed.  We waited for about 25 mins and in that time frame another family waited to be seated and then a couple came in about 15 mins later waiting to be seated.  A server immediately asked if the couple wanted to order drinks,  but never asked our family or the other family. Boy did I get thirsty in that time frame! After we were seated, Haley greeted us pretty quickly & we received drinks pretty fast as well. She asked if we were ready to order which we weren't,  but then she didn't return for quite a while & we saw that it seemed she was taking a break with another server.  When she did return,  I specifically said that my husband & I would be getting an appetizer,  but to not hold up the kids food order. That didn't happen.  We got our appetizer, & then about 10 minutes later,  the rest of the food came out.  I also asked her to put my stepson's sauce on the side so he could try it & she said OK.  When we didn't get the sauce,  I asked her to bring it. I also told her I got the wrong fish taco, she replied,  "you ordered the mahi". I said "yes,  but I wanted the beer battered". Her next reply,  "yeah,  but you just said mahi, not battered". (Shouldn't that be her job to ask?  I mean,  she should know the menu better than me right? ) apparently it was my fault because she assumed I wanted them broiled. I also asked for the fish taco meal (2 tacos) and a Carne asada taco on the side. I received one of each. When I told her I didn't get the other fish and it was supposed to be battered, that's when the fish discussion happened. Oh & to top it off,  the kids menu specifically says it comes with mandarin oranges, not the canned pineapple they gave my daughter, but never mentioned they'd be substituting. She hates pineapple btw, but loves mandarins. The bill comes & we see she had charged us for the fish meal & a fish taco on the side.  Should have been a fish meal & a Carne asada taco.  That would have been the way I ordered it & the least expensive. She even charged us for the sauce that came with my stepson's taco but we asked to put on the side. She also charged for extra carne when my other stepson asked for half chicken half steak instead of one or the other. He didn't get extra meat! Just half of each, so why did we get charged extra?! By this point I was too irritated to complain again, so we just paid the bill and left.  On another note,  I feel it's very inappropriate for an employee/manager to smoke & drink on the premises, in front of patrons, when wearing the uniform (t-shirt with logo). And the guy who originally told us to sit down & when he got a table he would seat us, did just this. I believe another employee referred to him as Pablo. We gave this place a try,  but we won't be back.  Aside from the service, the food was just mediocre. The Carne asada tasted as if it had been cut from a roast beef & the rice tasted like it came from a box. The best part was the "battered" Mahi. (Ah Ha! I said it right this time!)

I have to say that I'm not impressed by this location at all. Was greeted by a pleasant woman with short hair.  There were 3 of us and she sat us at a booth big enough for 8. Oh well not a big deal,  just awkward.  Noticed that the dough she had given to our daughter to play with was bone dry.  Asked for a new one.  Wasn't as bad,  but still not really moldable.  Got our drinks.  Put my straw in, took one sip and noticed 3 lipstick stains on the glass.  Gross! Server should have checked before delivering.  My daughter ordered pizza and it came out burnt. She was so hungry, she asked us to cut the burnt stuff off. Ordered the big beefstro salad... another disappointment. Could barely find any beef and there was definitely no jalapeños grilled into it. Plus,  what little beef there was,  was very greasy.  Also,  to make matters worse,  the fried onions on top were so burnt,  that it made my salad taste even more horrible than it already was.  I sent it back. Then the server sent the manager over to apologize and offer me something else.  That would have been a good move if the manager wasn't the same woman who had given my daughter the first dried out dough to play with! You'd think that her being the manager and all,  she would have made more of an effort to make a good first impression.  Anyway, they kept asking me if I wanted something else to replace my food and said they took the salad off our bill.  Kept saying no to food,  then the server asked if I wanted a pizzookie.  I never turn those down!  That was the best part of our visit!  Then the bill came. .. they took the salad off, but charged me for the pizzookie. Wow.  Taking the salad off is a given... it was inedible and I only took about 4 bites, so they didn't do me any favors there. But what did they do for my inconvenience? !  They should have comped the cookie too. Oh, another thing the server did... she automatically rang up large salads without even asking which size we preferred. Pretty tricky to get the bill higher, but how hard is it to take an extra few seconds to verify? Needless to say,  we won't be back to this location. We'll just continue to go to the other locations where we've had no issues.
