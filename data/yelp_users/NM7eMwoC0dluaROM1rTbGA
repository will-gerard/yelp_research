Standard Starbucks, but has great outdoor seating. The only drawback is you'll rarely be able to plug in your computer because there are only a couple outlets... also standard with starbucks.

I wish someone had written something here warning me not to shop here, while the salesperson seemed very helpful after the sale was done the customer service ended and the nightmare began.  Buying here was the mistake of the year.

We got a white leather sectional couch, it arrived three different shades of white and with three different textures of leather ranging from very smooth to basketball texture.  It was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had.  We tried to get the store to resolve this but the sales person we bought it from only had a one week career there and the store manager said that there was nothing he could do.  It took us over a year to resolve this issue, and the corporate office had to send someone down to finally look at our couch.  He agreed that it was not right and they finally replaced the couch.  We ended up getting gray even though we wanted white because we didn't want to risk the same thing happening again.  So we ended up with something that we didn't want in the first place and it took a year of headaches to even get that.  Every time I drive by the store I'm reminded of the horrible experience.  It makes me never want to buy furniture again.  And I'm always tempted to stop by and make a sign and donate an hour of my day warning people away from this place.  If you shop here I hope you use this information to have a more constructive experience.

I come here for the Mark Anthony collections.  Slim fitted clothes that I don't need to take to the tailor to look good in.

Great shopping.  Some of the stores here can't be found elsewhere in the phoenix area.

Long lines, and usually only one or two cashiers...

Under new ownership. They have really done a great overhaul on the store it has a sleek new look and they have a Sephora in there now.   It used to look geared towards an older crowd but has a new hip look.

The staff is great, very attentive and helpful.  The patio has misters in the summer and is shady.  TV's are everywhere if you're there for the game.  Great specials, and live music.  While I do eat there I don't go for the food, but rather the location, atmosphere and staff.  It's an enjoyable experience anytime of the day or night.

We usually shop here to get those harder to find import food items, but they also have a variety of other fun items, stationary, hats, furniture, etc.

I've seen the negative reviews in regards to the ER, but long waits and triage is really what I'd expect from that.  This review is for the surgery and stay at the main hospital.  They have a pre-surgery orientation where they give you tour and go over all the information and get all your questions answered, they have a fantastic booklet they give you with information specific for your procedure, and in the back of the book all the staff that will be involved put their cards with contact info in case you need them once you are there.  In pre-op they put you in a hospital gown that has a lining in it and connect it to a heater that pumps warm air in.  The army of volunteers there will give you a ride to and from your car, keep the system updated so that the person with you knows exactly what step of the process you are in.  The person with you also meets with the doctor immediately following the procedure while you are recovering and then are taken to the room that you'll be staying at.  The rooms at this hospital are the most "homey" and comfortable rooms that I've been in.  There is a couch bed for whoever is staying with you and additional seating in the room for visitors.    The food is also very nice and you just order it from a menu.  From my experience of hospitals in the area this one is the one that I will continue going to.

We got our first piano here, it comes with a six month play period and you can make payments on it.  We started with an upright and later upgraded to a baby grand.  This store lets you trade in the first piano you got from them for full credit of what you paid towards your new piano.  They also do financing.  Super happy with the end result.

This is my place of choice to meet people at, especially when we are working on the computer.  It is usually very quiet and they have plugs for the computer.  The only time I go to starbucks is when Kreative Kupcakes is closed which is on a sunday.  They also have good coffee (which they get direct) and a very good organic tea in different flavors.  Also try their homemade cheesecake if you're not in the mood for a cupcake.  Remember if you just want to hang out just go pick up a book from the library next door.  Did I mention they have a boutique in the back?

I only actually eat in the restaurant about 50% of the time, not that I have anything against it, its so close to my house I like to get take out and eat it at home.  Most of their staff has been there as long as I've been going there and are friendly and ready to serve.  For the value prices their food is very good with excellent service.

You may have to wait a bit for your food. But the food makes it totally worth it. That's what keeps us coming back over and over. Love it.

No crowds here.  Usually I feel like I'm the only one in the store.  That being said I'll usually have three or four of the staff ask if they can help me.  I also adopted a cat at this location and have been very happy how that turned out as well.

Great new location, convenient and exactly what Estrella was missing in terms of businesses.  The checkers are good too, many times handling two customers at a time!

Show your AAA Card for a discount at the stores.  Also there is a Tanger Outlet app for your mobile that will give you coupons and tell you about what stores have sales going on.
