My go to spot for great AM grub.  Service is great, has real chill vibe, and price is right. They have an assortment of cafe drinks to start your day off right. Biscuits n Gravy for around $3 is what i recommend.  Nice patio area to enjoy awesome early morning phx skies.  Oh and has free wifi :-)

Now i dont usually write reviews, but the ones i do write are gems....so here we go:  This dunkin runs smooth during the morning, but once the night crew comes in...game over.  Your drinks will be screwed up, you'll have rude service, and you'll be missing an item or two when picking up your order.  No idea how the night crew got hired seriously.  Example, i ordered a drink and it took 3min with the lady repeating it to me 8x...its a cot damn iced coffee w/mocha and cream...how hard is that?!?!  Then the other time, i ordered like 4x items, and her voice was like..."oh man, you're ordering alot tonight".  C'mom DD execs...play a game of UNDERCOVER BOSS and see what is really going on.

No joke, this place can just be called Welcome Chicken Wings ....the wings are that good! Its lightly battered, cooked right, and from what we've read all local.  I suggest asking for sauce on the side so you can dip or add as much as you desire.  Now the donuts....  Yes, they are legit. Im usually just a plain fatty kinda guy that like long johns, chocolate frosted, and bear claws....but these buujee donuts here are insane! Considering that DunkinDs sells their donuts for $1.00 each, these hand crafted ones are worth the small difference.  I suggest the lemon cake one.
