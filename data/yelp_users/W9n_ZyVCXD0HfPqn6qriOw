Our favorite place for grub before a D-backs game.  Surprisingly good food for a bar. And it's consistently good. Probably some of the best bar food I've ever had.  Same goes for the service--it's always fast.

I have yet to find a better blues, jump blues, swing, etc... venue in Phoenix.  So, on the Phoenix scale of music venues it gets 5 stars.  Yes, it's a dive. Which is a good thing.  No pretentious personalities at the Rhythm Room. Cheep beer, a decent dance floor, decent sound and great music are all that really matter.  Rhythm Room has them all.  It kinda reminds me of the Foothill (R.I.P.) in Long Beach, CA. And that's a good thing. I miss the Foothill dearly.  Also, what is possibly the best show (Mates of State), out of hundreds I've ever seen in many cities across the U.S.,  was at the Rhythm Room.

About as sleazy and unscrupulous as they come.   Went through all the standard BS that buying a new car comes with. Even a "trust me, we're friends, right?" And then some . . .  We negotiated a great deal with the sales manager.  We put everything he agreed to give us in writing and had him initial the agreement. Everything went downhill from there.  Sales associate and his manager took literally 3-4 hours to "put together" our paperwork (that they claimed would only take about 30-40 minutes).  They used this as a cheap tactic to try to get us to cave and settle for less than what we agreed to when it came time to sign the final contract.  When we got to the finance manager next door at the VW office to sign the final contract, he told us that he would not honor the the terms that the sales manager agreed to in writing.  We walked out and our sales person, desperate to save his deal chased us down and took us to see the Subaru/VW GM.  The GM fed us some more BS, told us he could not honor the agreement that the sales manager signed and offered us some oil changes, tire rotations and car washes to compensate.   We eventually caved and bought the car, but never received the deal that the sales manager agreed and committed to in writing.  We faxed the agreement (that the SM signed) to Subaru of America, who apologized and they cut us a check for nearly $500.00.  For months after we bought a new car from these guys, we received repeated phone calls at least once a week from different salesmen, asking us if we wanted to come in and buy a car.  Have been through the process of buying and/or leasing a new car at least 7 or 8 times and never have we experienced the level dishonesty, shadiness and overt sleaze that we did at this dealer.    Can't recommend highly enough that you avoid these guys at all costs.  P.S. The comment below from the manager is beyond moronic. There was no "miscommunication". We had an signed agreement. That's why Subaru corporate cut us a check for almost $500! These guys are not even scum, they are the waste product that scum excretes.

5 star location and view.  1 star service.  2 star food quality.  1 star atmosphere.  Outside of the outstanding view and patio, I'm having a hard time finding much positive to say about this place.  Service sucked. For a restaurant in this price range I'd give it negative 3 stars. Waiter was extremely inattentive. We ended up getting more (& better) service from a different waiter. Not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty. Our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered. This is 100% inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range.  Food flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd. The preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching, unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing.  Desserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste.  To add insult to injury, we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 (the restaurant was nearly empty) who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other, constantly using vulgar language.  It was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak. Again, for a restaurant in this price range, this is 100% unacceptable.  I'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had TGIFriday's prices.  Considering the prices, I prefer to give this place negative 2 stars. I'll have to settle for 1.  If you want to enjoy the view, simply stop by for drinks.  If you want a great meal and service, save your money for someplace like BLT or Rancho Pinot.

You're not going to find a more well-informed, friendly, helpful staff anywhere in the valley.  If you're looking for hiking, climbing, backpacking, camping, boating or rescue gear, AHS is the first and last store in the valley that you'll need to visit.  My girlfriend just purchased a new backpack and AHS spent as much time as necessary educating us and ensuring that she got the best pack for her needs and budget.  They also put effort into making sure she got the best fit by custom matching the waist belt, shoulder harness and pack to her body.  REI can be good, but AHS is great.  And definitely worth a visit.

Unsanitary, unsafe and extraordinarily shady and dishonest.    Sherry's Pampered Pets should be shut down.  We used Sherry's for boarding for about 1 1/2 years. Two very disturbing incidents led us to stop.  First--we asked to use their restroom.  When we first started going to Sherry's we asked to tour the facilities. We were told that due to liability issues, they could not give us a tour, but we could look at the play areas through the outside windows.  We thought this was a little strange since every single other kennel we've ever been to was willing (and wanted) to give us a tour. We figured we had no reason not to trust them so we accepted their excuse. Fast forward 1 1/2 years-- I desperately needed to use a restroom.  They didn't want to let me use it at first, but I told them it was an emergency and they let me. Quickly learned why they did not want to let me back there or give customers tours of the facilities.  The closed off area, that they don't want customers touring, is unbelievably, phenomenally filthy. And that's an understatement. I have never seen a dirtier restroom in even the seediest, filthiest truck stop gas station I have ever been to.  More importantly--they had stacks of kennels that looked like they came from a puppy mill.  They only place i have ever seen such dirty kennels and such a filthy facility is in those gut-wrenching puppy mill videos you see on SPCA or PETA.  It should be criminal to be running such a disgustingly filthy boarding operation.  Second--We went on an extended vacation (about two weeks). When we returned, our dog looked very tired and skinny.  The owner's sister (the older lady with the tattoos) informed us that our dog had not been eating anything for almost the entire stay at the kennel and she had consistent diarrhea for same amount of time.  We asked her if they made any attempt to call us or a veterinarian and she confirmed that nobody from Sherry's Pampered Pets did so at any time. At least 1-2 weeks of diarrhea and lack of appetite and not a single person at Sherry's bothers to call us or take our dog to a vet. We confirmed this story 3 times with this lady (because we were so shocked and could not believe the level of neglect). Short of our dog dying, I can not think of a much more extreme case of kennel negligence.  This situation should be (and possibly is) criminal neglect.    We returned to Sherry's within a few days to speak with Sherry.  When we did, her sister had completely changed her story (or so Sherry says).  Sherry claimed that her sister told her that our dog was sick for only the last 1-2 days of boarding. We asked Sherry to bring her sister out so we could confront her with her lie and Sherry refused.  Sherry's adult daughter then got in our face, yelling at us for "accusing" her aunt of lying (which she blatantly did). Needless to say, Sherry refused to refund our money or pay or veterinarian bills.  Short of our dog dying, we could not think of a more egregious, disturbing situation of animal neglect by a boarding kennel.  Not only did Sherry's completely violate our trust, they abusively (and possibly criminally) neglected our dog.  I really can not find the words to express how phenomenally disgusted and outraged we were over this case of extraordinary dishonesty, abuse and disturbing conduct by Sherry, her sister and her daughter.

Least favorite airport in the U.S.  Pain in the ass to navigate.  And that's all that really matters. Everything else is the same anywhere.    But PHX's crappiness doesn't really matter since you don't have a choice anyway. So what is the effing point in reviewing an airport?!  I'll tell you what the point is--I effing have insomnia and writing crappy reviews on Yelp while halfway awake is the only thing I can think of to do in the middle of the night. Cuz I'm tired of watching midgets selling real estate secrets and Joe Francis selling titty videos.  P.S. I'd give PHX 1 star but it has a dog park and a Paradise Bakery.

Totally shady operation.  SHAP puts coupons in the mail for cheap parking with free shuttle. No mention of hidden fees or surcharges. None.  Parking at Sky Harbor is cheaper, is on site at the airport, has more frequent shuttles, is far, far quicker and has no hidden fees. SHAP= $8.50 / Sky Harbor=$8.00  Upon returning from your trip and leaving the parking lot, you are greeted with a huge sign indicating a "fuel fee" for their "FREE" shuttle. It's only 3 bucks or something like that.  But really, it doesn't matter if it's 3 or 300 dollars.  All that matters is that they intentionally try to mislead people.  And when you complain, they point to a sign (mentioning the fuel charge) at the entrance.  However, conveniently, the entrance sign is poorly lit and about 1/10 the size of the sign at the exit. Very easy to miss. Especially at night. All five cars in front of us complained about the fee (we watched the SHAP employee point out the fuel fee sign to every single person)  If you like supporting businesses that are run by shady schmucks, feel free to donate to SHAP.  P.S. The coupon we used was a coupon issued by Sky Harbor Airport Parking, not a competitor, as Jason from SHAP suggested.  The coupon did NOT stipulate a fuel surcharge. And while the parking lot may be lit, the fuel fee sign at the entrance is not.   Regardless, how does SHAP reconcile charging money for a shuttle that they advertise, in bold, as "FREE 24-hour shuttle service"?! It's not FREE if you have to pay for it, SHAPtards.  Still a 100% shady company, Still stand by my review 100%.

Something is very wrong with the management of this store.  In a handful of visits about 40% of the items I shopped for were extraordinarily over-expired. Canned food that expired 2-3 years ago... Ice cream that has sublimated down to about 80% of its original volume (this takes a very, very long time), etc... And it's not just a few of each item that is long expired. I have often had to sift through most of the inventory of a product to find a single non-expired item.  Either the management is trying to cut losses and boost profits by unloading expired products on unsuspecting customers or the stocking staff at this store is phenomenally incompetent. Or both. Either way, the high volume of expired groceries at this store is not merely incidental.

Best effing oatmeal raisin cookie I've had in my entire life. Even if everything else on the menu sucked, this cookie alone would warrant the 5 stars. Fortunately everything else doesn't suck. Try it and see for yourself.  My other favorite is the turkey cranberry sandwich.

Hall of Frames stinks.   They recently started advertising with Yelp and have repeatedly complained to Yelp about a 100% genuine and honest 3 star review I wrote about my experience with their service. So Yelp has removed it twice. Now it's rewritten and a 1-star review:  80% of the cuts on their frames are very sloppy. They try to cover it up with putty and hope you won't notice.   Fortunately, the guys at this Scottsdale store are really nice and they have a no-hassle re-make policy.  Unfortunately, they've jacked up their prices. A lot. Now, even with a coupon, their current prices are at about the same level as their non-discounted prices from a few months ago. Now it's no longer worth all the hassle to get custom frames from HOF.  Save your money and go someplace else where they will do the job right the first time.

Super polite, helpful, knowledgeable and informative sales staff that will never talk down to you for not being a beer-bellied Guns N Ammo subscribing, card-carrying NRA member (like many of their competitors do).   If you're a lady, SGC staff won't creep you out like the desert-rat kooks staffed by many of their competitors. Also, SGC is in a well-lit, nice part of Scottsdale, not some shit-hole industrial park like many other ranges. So you'll probably feel safer here, if that is a concern.  If you're shopping for a new gat, you'll find a good selection, reasonable prices and a great staff.

Can't really say anything about the place that hasn't already been said--great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere, best bar food I've ever had, killer fries, Kiltlifter's great, 8th Street Ale's pretty good, blah, blah, blah. . . it's all true.  Actually I take that back--try the stuffed chicken if it's on the menu. (it's a special) It's effing awesome.  This place truly does have the best bar food. Anywhere.

Ever taken a flight on a crusty dog turd? Neither have I, but I imagine it's not much unlike flying US Airways--the all time worst airline in every conceivable way.  How does an airline (that is already at the bottom of the barrel) get away with cutting back so ridiculously far on service while simultaneously  jacking up prices so ridiculously high on everything from water to luggage to aisle seats?!  Wow, great business plan, douchebags--take something that already sucks, make it worse and charge people more for it!    Honestly, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the greedy crack smokers that run this airline started charging for toilet paper. By the square.

Uhhh, I think my neighbor is on crack.  He said, "Julio G's is the best!...blah blah blah...the food is so good...blah blah blah"  When he should have said, "Dude, stay the hell away from Julio G's, their steak effing tastes like cardboard."  I'd give it 1 star, but I reserve that for restaurants that have exceptionally bad service as well as food. J.G's had decent service, awful food.  I can't think of a single good reason to go to Julios G's.

Used to be a great place to get an after hours burrito.  After seeing the video of the chest-pounding, knuckle dragging bouncer pummeling some patron, we've x-ed Dos off our list.  We'd rather eat at the crappy Philly cheesesteak place or even pay Mickey's ridiculous--"wanna-be night club"--cover for late night eats . . .

Their strawberry pancakes are effing amazing! Well, at least the syrup is--they make it with your order. No Joke. The pancakes themselves are pretty good. Orange Table is one of (if not #1) our favorite places for breakfast in Scottsdale.   Best of all--if you have a pooch you can bring him/her and sit on the patio.

The only thing better than their cheese and portobello mushroom lasagna topped with crab and asparagus salad is two portobello mushroom lasagnas topped with crab and asparagus salad. One of the best lasagnas I've ever had in my life. Now, I may only be 8 years old (my picture is misleading), but I eat lots of effing lasagna. So trust me on this one.  Other pluses--super friendly staff, good wine selection, quiet atmosphere (Tues night).

Go there for dessert, inhale it before the flickering lights give you a seizure then run before you get sucked into a shit-hole linoleum time-warp.

Most of the time the music is good, like when Dennis Rowland is there. Occasionally it sounds like the type of jazz a 56 year old white lady who drives a Chrysler Sebring would listen to. Getting wine recommendations is a crapshoot-- the bartenders always recommend good wines but the servers are fairly inconsistent.   One thing you can always count on is some group of douchebags sitting right in front of the band and having social hour. Hey morons, STFU or sit in the back!

OMG, I miss San Marin.  Where else can you find an apartment that comes with free STDs and drunk ASU dropouts pissing on your car at 3 in the morning.  Seriously now--if you can tolerate being harassed by an inbred tow truck driver who can't read, some drunk dropout (who grew from the freshman 40 to the 5th year 50) screaming outside your window for 30 minutes at 2 in the morning about how bad she has to pee (because she's too effing drunk to figure out which key is for her front door) or contracting herpes merely by laying out by the pool, then by all means, move in.

The service on the back patio almost always sucks (1 server for about 15 tables), and their margaritas are the worst I've ever had (I think they make them with Lime-Aid or some crap like that)  But, we keep going back. And this is why--it's freakin hard to find good Mexican in Scottsdale.  And of all the options, F&L is one of the best (definitely #1 in its price range). The back patio has great atmosphere, the food is pretty decent and very reasonably priced, the salsa is pretty good, and their sopapillas are amazing.  As long as you're not in a rush, I highly recommend Frank & Lupe's.

I've come to realize that I like Frank and Lupe's patio atmosphere far more than the food.  The food quality is average. The service still, as Cartman would say, suck balls.  If anything, it's gotten worse.  Went there for dinner and watched the bartender/server oscillate between watching telenovelas (in 5-10 minute stretches), chatting with the busboy (in 10-15 minute stretches) and picking his teeth with his bare fingers (in solid 5-10 minute stretches).  When he wasn't busy with any of those productive activities he occasionally remembered that he had 4 tables with guests waiting for service . . .  I think we're going to start looking for a new great patio that has mediocre Mexican food.

Most over-hyped pizza in town.  Very crunchy, over-baked crust that was covered in black soot or some kind of crap that looked identical to black soot. Sauce that was too sweet and cheese that was M.I.A. Call me picky, but I like cheese on my pizza. Especially if I'm paying more than the price at any other pizza joint in town for it.  LGO pizza is far better. And it's also next door to the best effing gelato you'll ever have (Arlecchino).  Like my man Flavor Flave says--don't believe the hype.  Or, like I like to say--don't drink the kool-aid you effing moron.

Always impeccable service. Excellent wine list.  Delicious food and desserts.   Food is always made from fresh, locally grown ingredients.  So while you're enjoying a phenomenal meal, you can take comfort in knowing that your spinach wasn't picked by an 11 year old in Chile.  Then shipped on a CO2 coughing cargo ship to Long Beach. Then driven on smog spitting 18-wheeler to Scottsdale.   Food is consistently 4 1/2 star quality, as is the wine list.  If it weren't for the slightly kitschy, Gilbert Ortega-ish decor (jackalope included), I'd almost give the place 5 stars.

Hmmm. Don't really get all the negative reviews. We probably just got lucky, I guess . . .  Saw the Black Keys a few months ago. Had a blast.  The opening DJ (Local guy Johnny B or something like that) was effing awesome. This guy was playing the best, funkiest, randomly obscure funk and soul records from the 60's and early 70's. If anyone knows more about this guy, please PM me. Seriously. I have to meet him and find out where he buys his records.  Decent beer prices. Security staff was actually nice.  A/C was cool (tons of clubs keep it hot so you'll buy more booze) Sound was better than I expected. And we like the sloped floor which made it easier for everyone to see the band.  Until we have one of those (apparently frequent) gnarly bad experiences, we'll definitely keep going back.  P.S. Check out the Black Keys. Now!

"No spice", "small lunch special", waaaah . . . ignore all the babies.  They've never even had real Thai food.    Thai Basil is effing awesome.  And so is the family that owns the place.   Now, before all you haters get your panties in a bunch over the 5 stars, read what I have to say-- Thai Basil is not the cleanest, most well decorated Thai restaurant.  And it's not even the best Thai I've ever had.  But it's great food and the best Thai I've had in AZ.  And for the cheap price, awesome, flavorful food, friendly staff and large dinner portions, I give them 5 stars.  Highly recommend the peanut curry, pad Thai and pretty much everything else!

Huh, a lot of negative reviews lately.  We must be going at the wrong time because we've always been very happy with the food and atmosphere at the Bungalow.   As long as some self-centered douchebag's not out there smoking a cigar, the patio's a great place to relax with some friends, a beer and some very decently priced grub.  P.S. They have a pretty good steak sandwich.

When I die I want to be buried in a coffin made of Jack Daniels chicken strips.  That way I know I'll be in heaven even if Peter denies me at the gates . . . Woah, I just out-smarted God!  I swear, you can put Jack Daniels glaze on a petrified rat turd and even Top Chef snob Tom Colicchio would eat it.  It's that good.  If you're ever torn between this Friday's and the Desert Ridge TGIF, stick with this one.  The Desert Ridge TGIF frequently has shite service and inconsistent quality control in the kitchen.  Happy Valley TGIF, on the other hand, is consistently pretty good.  TGIFJD 4 life, foo.  And the afterlife too!

For some reason EC Uno falls far short of EC Dos in terms of food quality. Dos must have a superior kitchen staff?  Anyway, food was dry and far less flavorful than the meals we regularly get at EC Dos. Only been here once, so it could have been a bad night in the kitchen. Regardless, the food was disappointing enough to warrant never returning.  We'll stick with EC Dos, where the food is consistently great and has never disappointed us.  P.S. Pond is nice, but duck poop smell isn't...

Great place for inbred morons to apply for a management job.  Since that's what they seem to staff.  Went there once. Bottom 5 all-time for service.  Anywhere.  In the world.  100% mediocre food. 100% inbred manager.  There are better places to shop for meat, better places to eat Mexican and better places to hang with friends.  Don't say i didn't warn you.

Oregon chai. Spicy Oregon chai. That's all I care about. And Copper Star has it. They also have a nice atmosphere, cool patio with great misters, friendly staff and a big, plush couch.  Sorry, I can't help coffee drinkers with this review.  But if you like chai, they'll make it however you want it--even blended though it's not on the menu.  Now they just need to open up shop in Old Town and I'm set.  Bonus--it's right next to a very cool record store.  That sells real records!

The best effing gelato I have ever had. Period.  Anyone who tells you it tastes like Gelato Spot is high.  Arlecchino will never use artificial flavors in their gelato.  Parking is a bit of a PITA, but Arlecchino's gelato is well worth it.  And if you like chocolate, you must try Arlecchino's chocolate gelato.  It's one of the best chocolate anythings you will ever have.  In addition to having the best gelato, Arlecchino also has the best, super-friendly and very cool owners and staff.

I can't help but laugh at reviewers who spent 5 days in Italy and think this qualifies them to know more about gelato than someone who spent most of his life there(Arlechhino's owner). And additionally spent over a year learning from a (Italian) master gelato maker (in Italy) for no pay.  Really, ignore those fools.   Arlecchino still makes the best effing gelato I've ever had. Anywhere.  And anyone who tells you it tastes just like any other gelato has a broken brain.  Or tongue. Or both. Or is possibly high on crack. Or maybe employed by Gelato Spot. Take your pick.  P.S.  the owners and staff are awesome.

Best pizza in the valley (before you rip my head off, let me disclose that I have yet to try Bianco). LGO also has pretty good burgers, salads and consistently great sangria. Pretty cool, casual atmosphere.  If you're feeling social they have face-to-face seating on both sides a long, community bar.  Best of all, LGO is conveniently located next to the best Gelato in AZ--Arlecchino.

Went there for lunch for the first time and, surprisingly, the service was great.  Hmmmm. . . maybe they have better servers during the day? Don't know  (It was just as busy at lunch as it is at dinner).  Hopefully the dinner servers get it together, because we love the food.

Get an annual pass then get your hike n bike on.  CCRP is the best park in north Phoenix to do it.  It's close enough to be convenient & far enough, like Jake writes, to feel like you're out in the desert, not a backyard park like Papago (which is also a great park).  Great hiking, some great views and, with over a dozen miles of trails (+ more on the connected state trust land), great mt. biking. Cosmic ray gives it an 8 on the puck-o-meter (http://www.rei.com/product/763648)  Also, if you or your kids are into riding ponies CCRP has a corral where you can rent horses.

If, like me, you have recurring  dreams about eating nothing but cake cones filled just to the rim with vanilla soft serve ice cream, Jason's Deli is your Mecca.  Buy a sandwich, throw it away and welcome yourself to vanilla cake cone heaven. Every meal @ Jason's Deli comes with all you can eat soft serve ice cream.  If you have no money or morals, you can just skip the buying a sandwich part and cut straight to the ice cream.  Other than the ice cream, Jason's Deli has some effing awesome tortilla soup.  I've only tried one sandwich there, and it was pretty good. Wish I could remember what it's called...

F-North Korea, G-Dub needs to add Cox Communications to his "Axis of Evil"  Cox doesn't even deserve 1 star.  Cox has deserves negative 666 stars. And  pineapple up the ass like Saddam in the South Park movie.  Recently moved and got new service which entailed 1 filthy remote that was covered in grime and boogers, three defective cable boxes (one of which had to driven (50 minutes round-trip) to the Cox store only for the staff there to tell us it's an old, worthless box, then (literally) throw it in a junk pile, 6 hours on the phone with completely worthless tech-support (and 1 managerial) morons, three service appointments canceled by Cox computers (and 3 wasted mornings), yada, yada, yada . . .  There's not much that's more annoying in telephone customer service than to be given 100% canned responses (that have no relation to the problem you just spent 30 minutes describing to 3 different people in 3 different departments).  It's like talking to an effing brick wall.   "High speed" internet is frequently slow and digital cable picture quality sucks.  Basically cox is a 100% worthless, herpes, hepatitis, staph filled pile o' steaming pig turd of a company that doesn't give a flying F about customers since they have a near monopoly on their product.

If you're into freaks and geeks and toothless people with gnarly effing B.O., this Fry's is your place.  No joke.  Go to Sunflower instead. Or at least Safeway. It's probably . . . safer. Really. After moving to Arizona I learned (at Fry's) why all the Costcos have big signs in the front that read, "NO GUNS".  One night at Fry's some dirty, creepy, smelly kook started talking to us in line.  When he turned around to walk out, we noticed a huge fuc&ing .45 on his waist!  WTF is up with AZ gun laws?! And WTF is up with Fry's? Are they trying to win an award for biggest dump of a grocery store?  I think you can become addicted to crystal meth by default just by walking through this store!

I'm hooked on their steak quesadilla with green chili sauce like a ten dollar hooker to crack. It's that good. I have dreams about it.  Damn good strawberry margaritas as well.  And like Daren writes, the pollo fundido is pretty amazing. Also recommend the pollo chimi with green chili sauce and sour cream. Or red chili sauce... Both are great.  Best Mexican I've found anywhere in the valley so far.  Bring your appetite because the portions are huge.  My only gripes are that the service at the inside bar almost always sucks and the cheapskate moron of an owner needs to fix the ridiculous urinal that's about 10' off the floor in the men's bathroom.

I've never eaten a mouthful of sand, but if I did, I can't imagine it would taste much different than the rice and beans served at Tacos Del Mar.   If it is the goal of TDM to produce the most bland tasting Mexican food on the planet, they are doing a pretty good job.  In addition to the rice and beans, not much can be said for their dry, flavor-free steak as well.  If you're into eating cardboard, I suggest you try TDM's steak tacos. You'll be in heaven.  I'd give the place one star if it weren't for the friendly employees. Those bastards.

Best strawberry cupcakes and strawberry frosting on the planet!  I'm in love. Seriously.  I think next time I might get a whole box of strawberry cupcakes and pull a Jason Biggs on them.  If you know where I can find better ones, please let me know.     Disclaimer-- I've never been in the store so my rating is based solely on the Sprinkles strawberry cupcake I received on my b-day. But with a cupcake this good, nothing else matters anyway. . .

The fastest haircut, 21 dollar or otherwise, I've ever had.  What the owner lacks in personality, he makes up for in speed.  V's is a smartly and cleanly designed and decorated barbershop for men.  It's better than Supercuts and much cheaper than a salon. Despite the affordability, they still sell quality men's products like American Crew.  Some may see this as a bonus--during your cut, the owner will probably say no more than 5 words to you and will change his facial expression exactly zero times.  Cedric & Ice Cube's Barbershop this is not.  Good place for a reliable, (but nothing spectacular), affordable haircut.

Dear barber,  Please go back to measuring school.  1/2 inch does not = 2 inches.  Again, 1/2 inch does not = 2 inches.    Went in for a trim, asking for 1/2" off the top.  Left looking like I just enlisted in the Army.  Literally.  (google "high & tight") WTF?    I recant anything positive I wrote in the previous review.  Dude cuts hair like Kobayashi eats hot dogs--fast and messy. When it comes to barbers, speed and frugality is not necessarily a virtue.  Not the worst barber on the planet and the other barbers in this shop may be less frugal with their time + more careful with their client's hair, but I am not willing to return to find out in this lifetime.

It's what a hamburger's all about.  Ever smoke crack? I have. While eating a Double Double off the a$$ of a stripper.  Just like Doogie Howser in Harold & Kumar.  Except it was a Double Double with grilled onions , not a big fat line of coke.  I was able to kick the crack. Still working on the strippers.  I will never be able to quit In N Out.   Remember to order a chocolate shake.

There's only one thing in the world that could possibly be better than sex with Alessandra Ambrosio-- sex with a Sweet Republic Ice Cream covered Alessandra Ambrosio. It's that good. Anyone have her phone number?

Great place for sushi as long as you like snail-paced service and last week's fish on a Wednesday night.  Server took about ten minutes to even approach our table after we were seated.  After that it took 4 requests and 15-20 minutes for her to simply to bring us some water.  It doesn't get any better from there so I'll spare you the details.  Food was ok.  Entree that was served did not match menu description. Sauce on chicken was great, probably even some of the best I've had. Unfortunately the chicken was over-cooked and a bit dry.  Salmon nigiri tasted like it was from last week. It definitely was nowhere near fresh. Tuna was much better.  Which isn't saying much, but means it was decent and relatively fresh.   Rolls were ok.  Never seen cream cheese in a roll until dining here. This was the first and will be the last time I eat any type of sushi with cream cheese.  Regardless of how you may feel about cream cheese in sushi, the huge amount of it that was put into the roll was overbearingly disgusting. I tasted more cream cheese than anything else.  The place seems like it could have potential.  Maybe the fish is fresher on a Fri or Sat night...   Unfortunately their prices are too high for the quality of food and service.  Next time I'm taking my money elsewhere.

One of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  5 star food, 3.5 star service. If it weren't for faltering service, I'd give the place 5+ stars.  Everything about this restaurant, from the menu, the printing of the menu, the furniture, decor, the generous spacing of the tables, and the demeanor of the servers is almost perfect.   Mix of music was a bit random and inconsistent with the atmosphere--Rick James "Give It To Me Baby" sandwiched between Coldplay's "Clocks" and some quiet jazz.  It was easy for me to ignore, but I could see how others might be easily disappointed.   The service started out with 5 stars--well articulated recommendations and menu knowledge, great timing, didn't have to ask for anything, etc... Unfortunately, 1/3 of the way through our meal the attentiveness and timing (clearing plates, pouring wine, serving entrees in less than 1 hour!) started to severely falter.  At least server took initiative to apologize and offer 4 free desserts for our party of 4.  We'd still rather have great service and a dining experience that doesn't take 3 hours (due to slow service and slow kitchen), over free dessert.  However, a simple apology for poor service can go a long way. Especially when it's accompanied by the best rack of lamb in the valley.  It's hard for me to articulate how well prepared and phenomenally delicious every single item was.  Every cut of meat--the lamb, steak and fish was excellent. The chef's combinations of seasonings and herbs perfectly complemented the meats. Every side was also amazing--best onion rings anywhere, perfectly grilled asparagus (precisely the perfect amount of char to add excellent flavor without burning the them).  Be prepared to skip an appetizer and save room for dessert--it's by far the best I've had anywhere in PHX.  Between the phenomenal complimentary popovers, entrees, sides, & wine I can't fathom anyone having enough room for both dessert & apps. So make it dessert. And strongly consider the peanut butter chocolate mousse w/ banana ice cream or the crepe souffle with passion fruit sauce. I'll be dreaming about those for the rest of my life.  Yes, it's expensive. But more than worth it.

Not sure what exactly they serve here. I certainly wouldn't call it frozen yogurt...  I guess if you mixed a slurpee, ice cream and yogurt and made them taste like pasty, icy soft-serve you would have Mojo's version of "frozen yogurt".  It doesn't help that it's ridiculously over-priced and you really have no way of knowing that the yogurt is going to cost you $7-13 (compared to $2-4 at Golden Spoon) until you get to the register where they weigh your self-served yogurt & toppings then empty your wallet.  Also definitely not a fan of the self-serve toppings. How many booger/staph/fecal--tainted fingers do you think have been all over those serving spoons or even in (kids' fingers) the toppings?

Only slightly better than average food (for the price range). Excellent service. Horrendously unacceptable atmosphere.    Dined here after 9pm. Looking forward to the first tolerable outdoor temps this summer, sat outside on the patio which we were told was non-smoking. Patio was quiet and peaceful--we were the only table seated out there until several people came out, sat a few tables over from us and started smoking.  Disappointed, we immediately got up and went inside. Asked the waiter about the smoking and he moved our food and drinks inside rather than ask the smokers to smoke elsewhere.  Sitting inside was no better.  The group at the small bar was very loud and vulgar. Even a restaurant employee was literally screaming inside the dining room.  When we got the check the waiter explained that he took two drinks off the check because the smokers were actually restaurant employees on a smoke break. WTF?!  He would have been better off not telling us that the smokers were employees.  If he didn't tell us we might have considered coming back. Knowing that the manager allowed employees to smoke on the patio while paying guests were dining out there only motivates me to write a review, not return and spend more of my hard-earned money.  No amount of great service or decent food can make up for a 100% unacceptable, avoidable and miserable restaurant atmosphere.   Zero effort was made to show even the most minimal consideration for that fact that paying guests were dining in the restaurant.  What kind of restaurant owner or manager allows the staff to create such a miserable dining experience for customers?

Owner is a greedy crook.  Supreme pizza is $8.50, hawaiian is $6.50. Ordered half hawaiian/half supreme. When I picked up the pizza, the owner charged $13.50 for an 8 dollar pizza. What kind of scam is the owner trying to run?!   The d-bag owner tried to give some BS excuse that he doesn't do half/half on pizzas & instead doubles the toppings on each half of a single pizza. WTF?! I didn't order double toppings, a-hole. Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.  He then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?! You just made yourself look like an even more of an A-hole, dude.  How anyone believes they can get away with trying to rip people off in the age of the internet is beyond me.  P.S. I called 4 other Little Caesars franchises in the area and none of them charge 70% extra do a half/half pizza.

The only time I've ever seen guacamole the Ocho Loco's shade of dark green/brown was once when I left some guac in my fridge for 4-5 days.  It doesn't take a CSI lab tech to see that the Ocho Loco served us tasted and looked like it was at least several days old. Which is completely disgusting and 110% unacceptable.  Can't say much for the rest of their food...  The chicken in their chimi is the most bland, flavor-free anyone in our party has ever had. Anywhere. And the fact that it was dry did not help.  I could go on and on about how much everything else we ordered sucked. But I'll spare you. I'll just say that after 4 years and at least 2 dozen different Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, the food at Ocho Locos was the most disappointing.    I'd give them 1 star but the service did not warrant it.

About the only positive thing I can think of about this office is that it was clean.  Which isn't saying much.  Made an appointment for x-rays and cleaning. It wasn't until after I was in the chair for x-rays that someone told me that my teeth were not going to be cleaned that day and I needed to schedule another appointment for the following week. I was informed that it is their standard practice to schedule x-rays and cleanings on separate days. Considering that when I scheduled the appt, I was explicitly told I would be getting x-rays and cleaning, this was very frustrating.  I was equally frustrated when I went to pay cash for the x-rays and found that this office charges an insane amount just for digital x-rays-- between $200-300! Just for x-rays!  Looking back, I feel like I should have known better. While sitting in the lobby, I could very clearly hear Dr. Samandari asking patients about their sexual activity, if they have HIV, hepatitis, etc...  These patients were in chairs in a room that is wide open to the lobby--no walls,no doors, no privacy, nothing.  When it was my turn, he asked me all the same questions.  Questions about sexual activity are very inappropriate for any dentist to ask, let alone ask within very clear hearing range of other patients. This is a very significant HIPAA violation.  My girlfriend also visited Dr. Samandari earlier the same day.  She had even worse feelings about her visit.  She said that Dr. Samandari was extremely slimy and condescending. The said he kept calling her "princess" and "sweetie", (despite the fact that she is 29!).  She said she got a very creepy feeling from him and that he seemed like a sleazy d-bag from an Old Town nightclub who has very little to no respect for women.  I can not recommend highly enough that you avoid this office and Dr. Samandari.  He has to be the sleaziest, shadiest, most untrustworthy dentist both my girlfriend and I have ever been to.

The dudes who work here are too busy being rad to be bothered with customers.  The staff at Bicycle Haus is much more friendly and helpful.
