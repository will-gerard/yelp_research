My new spot, for sure.  Went in for a full with clear gel (22) Danny, the nail tech, thinned the top and slimmed down the sides of my ridiculous white tips (from another nail salon) without having to ask.  The look so good!!!! I'm not an acrylic nail person but I originally got them for an interview.  After this place, I may continue getting them.  Pedicure (20) from another tech was just okay.

4 for the incredible fresh baguettes made there. Fab $1 bins for day old bread, and great to-go selections. Been coming here for years. Last few visits have been disappointing for sandwiched-and I've been coming here for years. Very strong iced coffee. Hard bread on viet sandwiches and subs :( great croissant sandwhiches.

Unique decor-reminds me of my fav place in FL, great customer service, loyal patronage, the kids can color all over the walls, nice draft and prices, great priced specials. Tonight we had the large cheese and small salad for $15. Token system for a free pizza. Buy 10, get one free. Loved everything except the ranch. I messaged the business to make a house ranch. If you're a ranch person, like myself, then you know how it can throw the pizza and salad off. My family considers this their new "local pizza spot"; I'll call ahead about that ranch, though.

I used them & they got EVERYTHING deleted off my credit report & my score went up 100 points.  The staff is extremely friendly/helpful & they bend over backwards for clients.  They're true professionals & I do highly recommend their services for credit repair.  They are not magicians. You have to do your part meaning: send them info they ask you for, sign things that they ask you to sign, open a "secure credit" card on your own. Most banks have them & they will give you referrals if you need info to get one.   Most ppl think you sign up & they take it from there. NO. That would be impersonating you. They're the experts & do the majority of the work. The client is responsible for responding to their requests.

Worst service ever!!!!! I ordered a turkey burger, was served beef. It was burned and waited 30 plus minutes for it.  I was with ten other ppl. ALL of our burgers were burned. I went back to the cashier to tell her. She was mean and told me to move out of the way and that I had to speak to the manager. The elderly night shift manager told me to give her my receipt and they puffed up like they were going to fight me. Another cashier started at me. I held out both my receipts. they refunded my money and yelled at me to throw my old food in the garbage that I gave back to them. Never apologizing for quality or service, I turned and Walked away. The cashier and manager yelled at me from across the casino!!! to throw my tray out. So unprofessional. They're lucky my entire party didn't demand refunds. the way treated us is unacceptable.

Goddammit Artemiza. I waited 20 minutes for my coffee in the drive thru. FOR DRIP!! Delish coffee, but you're lucky I had a passenger in the car bc I was about to go zero to crazy having to wait 8 seconds longer in my car.  Move the special orders for us old-schoolers!!

Made an appointment and asked for guidance in preparation for office visit. Waited an hour to be seen even though I was the first client if the day.  In my room I was asked to sign additional waivers even after completing initial paperwork. Seems sketchy and wait time seemed contradictory. One rep on the phone was extremely rude and hung up on me when I asked to speak with my doctor. Really? I'll take my business elsewhere.

Please drop your 1/2 glass of Strawberry beer from $7 down to a reasonable price, then I'll be back. Seriously, I got a glass of brrr cut in half. Embarrassed by my sippy cup of beer.  Delicious, though. 4 for ambiance, location and hours.

Yelp Bff recommended this place. Perfect day drinking spot with rich food to keep tummy happy. Pasty was flaky, buttery, and selection of filings are from international cuisine. Beautiful patio. Great place to get together with friends. Perfectly priced food and beer. Big draft selection.

Perfect for intimate date setting. Quiet, soft music, small restaurant. 100% authentic French cuisine. Huge portions. Helpful and attentive waitress. Explained menu items. I could've split and entree and added a salad. Entrees typically $18-28.  Took my S/O for a celebratory dinner and he ordered the steak. Beautiful presentation, huge portions, delish tomato herb butter on top.  The S/O reported this is the best steaks he's ever had. Incredible experience from a small seemingly mom & pop shop.

Five star staff and food. Best happy hour prices-full portions-large variety in HH menu. All items full portions. Appetizers,regular rolls and drink combos 2-10. Apps mostly under 5, rolls 3-6, drinks 3-12.  Staff aStaff accommodating to kids, sushi chef saw how happy  my kid was to watch the chef and he gave her a slice of octopus. She thought it was the best thing ever. Staff always personal and treats as guests not just customers. Music a tv and dim lights for dinner-good ambiance. Clean restrooms and dining area. Our #1 sushi spot in AZ.
