Found this place through yelp with tons of awesome reviews and happy to say that Pizzeria Bianco did not disappoint! I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this place might be one of the best.   The restaurant is pretty small but I loved the atmosphere of this place and the beautiful brick exterior of the restaurant was my favorite! We almost didn't come because we didn't want to have a long ridiculous wait, but I'm so glad we decided to come anyway. Luckily, we went there after the lunch rush around 2pm so we got seated in less than 10 minutes!   The service was great and the pizza was amaaaazingly delicious! We devoured our pizzas in silence cus it was that good hahaha. I'm actually craving it quite a bit as I am writing this review.... everything about the pizza was perfect! It was a 10/10!! :D We got the Margherita and the Wiseguy pizza. The toppings were extremely fresh and I loved the smokiness of the crust from the wood-fired oven. Wish we got to try all the other signature pizzas as well. The pizzas are a bit pricey compared to the size, but I think it was worth it :)

When I visit a new city, the first thing I try to find is the city's perfect coffeeshop! I think Lux takes it for Phoenix.   Casual, hip, & trendy atmosphere. Their decor was a mix of simple, modern with a vintage twist, I loved it! The workers were very outgoing and friendly which is always a big plus. It was hard to find seats because it was super packed but I'm not complaining.  The noise level was pretty loud so I didn't understand how people were studying here. It seems more like a place for social outings. All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Lux.

Cozy & pleasant atmosphere, delicious food, awesome service, great patio area and free valet. What is not to like about Chelsea's Kitchen?  We loved every single plate that we ordered. Not only was everything tasty, but it also had a beautiful presentation. My favorite was the Brussels sprouts salad!! YUM! I think this was the best salad I've had, ever! If you don't like brussels sprouts, this salad just might change your opinion about it! hahaha The rotisserie jidori chicken was very tender, juicy and flavorful! Delish :) The surf and turf taco platter was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. They also have a great selection of signature cocktails. Cucumber press was really good and very refreshing. Also, you can never go wrong with the white sangria!   I will come here again if I ever visit Phoenix again. Great experience, highly recommended :)

I don't know about their bubble tea but their shaved ice was not good at all :( I was so disappointed. I have tried many different shaved "snow" and this place was too creamy and sticky and not fluffy at all. And the mochi topping was so hard and stale, I couldn't chew it.   If you are looking for the fluffy shaved snow from other places like Cali or Houston, you won't find it here. It just looks yummy, but doesn't taste the same. Blegh.
