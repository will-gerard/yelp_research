This place is awesome! They have great quality sushi at great prices. I live the one on Hayden and Indian Bend so I am always there. I know that I can go to Blue Wasabi or Stingray but what I like about this place it's not stuck up or pretentious like the other places. Many people go there because it's the place to be seeing.   If you want good sushi at good prices without having to wear you best pair of Seven jeans this is the place for you. They have multiple locations so you can be in nay part of town and find one of their locations.

Ok...first off I traveled all the way to Fountain Hills for this one. I felt like Survivor Man going way up there. If it wasn't for my friends treating me I don't think I would have gone...but enough of me complaining about the trip there.   This place isn't really much to look at I'll be honest. We were seated promptly and the waitress was really nice. We started off by ordering some teriyaki chicken sticks that pretty much had no flavor at all. So by now I was worried about the sushi. To my surprise the sushi was actually pretty good...not great but good. The prices were fair and the service was ok too. The only thing that was weird was when I went to the bathroom it was located outside the restaurant...like close to the ally. It's safe to say that as long as I didn't get food poisoning it was a good night but I won't be going back.

I love this place. You can't get any better than a place that offers really good Italian food at great prices. I always have the pepperoni calzone that always leaves me feeling like I'm going to pop.  This place doesn't try to be anything other than a great family run business. When you get there you can hear one of the owners in a heavy Italian accent yelling in the kitchen...it doesn't get any better. If you are near central and Thomas you have to try this place.  You won't leave disappointed!

So when I was invited to go to Lon's for dinner I will be honest I was not expecting much. I did know that it was hidden and that it was in PV but as soon as you take a look at the place it becomes obvious that this was going to be a great dining experience.  As soon as I drove in the valet greeted me with a smile and so did every one else. The wait staff is very nice and helpful if you have any question about the menu.  The place is gorgeous and definitely a date place.  But be prepared to spend money but it is totally worth it. I had the grilled beef tenderloin that was cooked to perfection.   I have been back and I am never disappointed with this place and you won't be either.

Great food...check, Great atmosphere...check, reasonable prices...check! How can you go wrong with Cibo. This is one of my favorite places for lunch downtown. I have been there numerous times and I am never disappointed.   I always tend to have the Salciccia sandwich which is sausage, onions, peppers and mozzarella cheese with a great house salad.  At dinner they serve delicious pizza.  The wait staff is always nice and very helpful. This is a great date place if you want to avoid all the chain places that occupy most of Phoenix.  Definitely try it out.

First off I LOVE this place! I have never been disappointed with the food or service. If you love breakfast food this is your place. You have to try the Salami Scramble with home fries (which are the best damn potatoes this side of Idaho).  Also, if you're lucky the special of the day might be the eggs benedict that are making me hungry just thinking about them.  If you get there around 11:00 am be prepared to wait but they will seat you pretty fast. The customer service is great and the prices are cheap! Don't come here if you want a healthy breakfast because it won't be but it will be some of the best breakfast food you will ever have!

Okay, first off don't make the same mistake I made in thinking that this is a place to go eat because it's not. It's a wine and beer bar. They brew their own beer that actually tastes really good. They do have appetizers for you to munch on. I will suggest the pretzel...trust me you will need help eating this sucker and it's delicious!  The place has a really intimate feel to it. It's lit pretty dark but it works for it. I suggest you take some friends for happy hour or drop by before a Suns game. I don't think you will be disappointed.

Well I have to say for being a small place in central Phoenix this has some of the best sushi in the city. Hana is owned by the same guy who used to have the place in the Biltmore called Ayako.  You get great customer service and really great quality sushi. The prices are as generous as the portions. It is a really low key, unpretentious place right across the street from channel 3 on 7th ave and Missouri.  I love going here for lunch and dinner...even though it's out of my way. If you are looking for a new place for sushi that doesn't have that "chain" feel to it this is your place. Make a trip to Hana.

Ok...this place is from the guy that brought us Fez and Ticoz. Now I actually like Fez and Ticoz because they both have good food so I was expecting the same here.  The place has a very cool vibe to it and the wait staff is very nice...especially a tiny brunette...tip her well! I have had the Buffalo chicken sandwich which did not have too much sauce so it didn't take away from all the other ingredients. I also had the Cordon bleu pita that was amazing.  This is definitely a great place for lunch...especially because it's so close to where I work. I have not been for dinner but I expect the same great service.

Ok...so I will admit that I actually liked this place. The atmosphere was very chill and it didn't have that "Scottsdale" feel of superiority.  I went with a friend and I had the turkey sandwich with the French salad which was pretty damn good...trust me if I am raving about a salad it must be good.  What did throw me off was that you don't really have a waiter. You walk in you grab a menu (that looks like a medical chart) and you place your order with the cashier and pay for it all at once. Then they bring you your food (just like Pei Wei).  So I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and I am definitely going back.   P.S. Does anyone know why they have price tags on everything? Are they always selling their furniture? I felt like I was eating at Pottery Barn!

Well my first experience at Canal was a few weeks ago on a date. To be honest I really wasn't trying to impress her I just wanted to try the place that even Bill Clinton had to check out.   I made a reservation for Saturday night which was very busy and even though I was going to be 15 minutes late I called the restaurant and they were very nice to hold the table for me without any attitude from the hostess at all. I arrived and obviously it's pretty stereo-typical Scottsdale. Now, I live in Central Scottsdale so I'm pretty used to seeing the plastic, super tan women and the "Growing Up Gotti" guys by now so I really didn't care all I wanted as a nice dinner.  Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu so she made it very easy for us to decide on our dinner but I knew what I wanted even before I saw the door. I know the price is ridiculous but I wanted to try the 30$ Burger. But after thinking about it I really didn't want to grub on a sandwich while I was wearing white and sitting across a girl I semi-liked. So I went with the $30- something Filet Mignon with parmesan fries. It was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious. My date had the Achiote Citrus Seared Mahi Fish Tacos which she loved.   The prices for certain items weren't all that bad either just the drinks and a few select items on the menu like the grilled cheese sandwich and soup for $15 that are just way too overpriced! I guess that is the price you pay to be in a "hip" restaurant. I'll be honest I will be back...only to tackle that $30 sandwich or if the girl I took there on a date calls be back!  (note to self: 4 beers and 2 jack & cokes makes you look like an ass even after a great dinner!)

I'm only giving this place one star because I couldn't figure out how to give half a star.  Now, I'm neither a sushi expert nor a snob when it comes to it but I know quality sushi when I taste it and this was not it. It was too bad because my friend and I were really excited to try this place out...especially since she lives across the street and we have been waiting for them to open their doors for a while.   I kind of got the feeling that this was going to be an interesting evening when we walked in and nobody really acknowledged our presence until I gave the chef the "tell me if I should seat myself or wait for the waitress before I stab you with a chop stick" look...right after that he gracefully mouthed the words "just sit anywhere". After waiting for 5-7 minutes the waitress finally came and brought us water and gave us some menus to look over. Normally on a Friday evening I would've understood the wait but the place only had like 10 people inside!   At this point I am really hoping that the sushi will make up for the crappy service. The menu had some unique rolls with some traditional rolls too. We wanted to try some of their own creations so we picked the Sqidinator, Bubba Gump roll, and the old favorite...the Philadelphia Roll.   So, at this time I'm feeling pretty good about our choices until they made us wait forever for our food. I think the remaining artic glaciers melted while we were waiting...ok so I'm exaggerating but that's how it felt!  When they finally brought out the sushi the Philly roll and the Squidinator were first. I went for the squid first and as soon as I bit down all I could taste was the mayo they put inside. It was so overpowering you couldn't even taste the squid. Obviously I was disappointed. Now, with the taste of mayo and fried squid in my mouth I reached for the Philly roll hoping the cream cheese inside would wash away the aftertaste of the roll. At least with this roll they didn't add too much of anything but the quality was definitely not there. I mean c'mon who messes up a Philly roll! They managed to make it taste like something I could buy at Safeway!   Now, all my hopes, dreams and future business were dependent on a roll named "Bubba Gump". Well just like the movie this roll should have been left to die in Vietnam! Again, they added to much mayo and some kind of hot sauce. They should have just gave me a bowl of mayo, hot sauce and rice...maybe that would have been cheaper because for these prices I should have gone to Stingray or Ra. Now, the worst part came at the end of the evening...no it was not the bill it was when the waitress asked if everything was good...and I answered "everything was great! To this day I don't know what left more of a bitter taste in my mouth...the food or my lie.   This might have all been grand opening bugs they will work out but for the time being for quick sushi I am sticking to Sakana which is around the corner from my place.
