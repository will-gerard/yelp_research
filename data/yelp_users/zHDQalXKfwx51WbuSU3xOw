I love Einstein's but this location was busy at 9am and didn't have half  of their options available and when asked when they would put bagels out they  said half an hour.  I don't understand why at such a busy hour they weren't at all prepared nor apologetic.  I'll be back but it was a disappointing experience

Delicious! Great lunch combo selections. Had the Pepperoni pizza slice with the berry-luscious salad. Will be a favorite!
