Looking for casual "dive type" yet clean?  Great place here!  Mind you, when I say "dive" -to me this term is a positive, endearing term that means friendly people with a "local's" feel.  Friday nights typically consist of some really great bands; and Sat. nights for poker --free play, no buy in!  Although -the 7pm start is the more die-hard serious players...the 10 p.m. start seems more laid back by this time and this is the round where I jump in with my less than stellar knowledge of poker and just want to have some fun interaction!  The staff is really great --they are who they are and don't pretend to be anyone else --I love interecting with the "real" personalities of the staff and the patron's all interact easily whether they know you or not.  When you order a drink -treat the staff like a friend you just met -and not "wait staff" -they will remember you and appreciate that you recognize they are working hard for you and everyone around you!  A very friendly local's hang out --so whether you are from North Phoenix or out of state vacationing -visit this place for a friendly interaction with the locals -casual atmosphere with all walks of life -great pool playing and people watching on any night!

Great Sushi, great drinks, great service and most of all -great staff!   After a couple of visits -the staff miraculously remembers what you and your friends ordered to drink or eat!  I was meeting a friend there so I ordered my drink and the service connoisseur asked what my guest would like and I couldn't remember what he drank!  She asked me if he had been there before with me and I said yes -and began to describe him amongst the group that was with us last time --she immediately said "oh yes, he had a "drink name here" and said she would bring him a cold one to be ready for when he arrives"......amazing -I still can't remember what he drank -but the fact that she remembers you when you come in -and can remember you if you aren't even there yet....that's what I call excellent service and a true connection with your customers!

There is never any staff on the floor overseeing to ensure weights are re racked or bars are broken down, machines/ weights are shared. You get bro's that will put every 45lb plate on the sleds or calf machine, do 5 reps and walk off and not put weights away; I'm sorry bro.... You too tired to break down the weights.....here let this pretty young lady take care of that for you!  Stations are always missing weight to leave you to wander the gym to steal from elsewhere. I've lifted for over 14 yrs and never seen such inconsiderate members in a gym that is mis-managed. Time to look for a new one.... It's not often I'm this dissatisfied with a service.... If you are trying to compete with the other gyms in this price point, at least have 1 person monitor the floor.

This is by far the best Indian cuisine in the Valley -and I have been to several trying to find a good once since moving here 5 years ago!  They are hardly busy -so you get right in and sit to eat immediately -great for a work day lunch as it is quick!  I have only attended during the lunch buffet which is always phenomenal!  They always have the following on their lunch buffet menu (I frequent often!)  Chicken Tikka Masala -my fav. chunks of white meet in butter/tomato sauce Tandoori Chicken -chicken grilled in a Kiln with onions -moist and yummy Paneer Masala  -goat cheese cubed in the same great butter/tomato sauce The fried veggie crips are delish! (can't remember the formal name) Basmati Rice (so tasty you could eat it by itself!) Kheer --best rice pudding ever! (besides moms! :-) Gulab jamun -little donut hole type treat soaking in a light syrup -yum! ...and this is a small sampling of what is on the buffet!  Service is fabulous and they are very friendly -but beware...if you come in often enough -they treat you like family and will remember your fav. drink and offer to bring you one when they greet you!

If you are looking for more of a Lounge hang out with good drinks and live music -with even a small dance floor --check this place out!  You can go for dinner -and stay for the live band and evening interaction -or just plan to go during happy hour or after 8p.m to enjoy the bar area where the band camps out!  The music is always fabulous for listening and dancing if you choose.  The crowd has appeared to be 45+ on the times I have visited -and very lively and interactive -but still laid back with the lounge feel.  I only rate it a 4 instead of a 5 because the last few visits were a bit of a wait for drinks when the bar was far from full.  All the staff members are very pleasant and helpful!

Great location right off of the highway.  I mostly attend for the Zumba & Muscle classes which I feel this location has several of the best instructors!  The staff always seems to be very friendly and available to help unlike some of the other big box brand gym's I have frequented in the past.  I have been a member at this club now for over 3 years and like that I can go to the other locations without any issues.  If you have children -they will love the play center daycare -large climbing tunnels and bounce house as well as they are taken out to the rock wall for more fun.  This location also has a Chiropractor, Physical Therapy Center in it and a Spa has been under construction and hopefully will open soon.  A smoothie bar by the entrance that has very affordable and tasty beverage options.

Breakfast for the active.... Yummmm. Very quaint and even a drive thru if you are in a hurry but definitely not fast food type quality.

I'm trying to remember the last time I ate somewhere where I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the experience. None of them compare to this hidden gem! All food courses were delish! The patio is one of the most quaint outdoor areas I've found here. And the atmosphere... It's hard to put in words but let's see if this country farm girl can do it: it is like a comfortable evening at a barn raising dinner gathering crossed with a romantic candlelit dinner with your beau at a posh downtown eatery.... unique and very enjoyable!

I was extremely excited to find a vintage consignment bridal shop because it seems like all of the large retail bridal stores carry the exact same thing and I wanted a larger style variety.  However when I got to the shop, I was quite a bit disappointed... not only in the pricing, but in the condition of the dresses also.  Most of them were extremely frayed, ripped, and missing buttons -as well as dirty.  The shop really is in such a cute area of downtown Tempe, and could be a budget conscious young woman's dream come true if the dresses were properly cared for prior to placing on display and priced according to their used value.

Great sandwiches, soups, and salads.... Very hearty soups and the salads aren't skimpy by any means with plenty of various toppings.   Gluten free pasta is also available and looked amazing though I haven't had.... Yet! :-) I will make this a regular stop.
