Came here with a friend from college and his fianc√©e and would gladly come back. They have really great happy hour drink and food specials. I had a sake sangria which was light and fruity. For my meal I ordered the potstickers--so delish! --and one of their sushi rolls. Our server was quick and helpful. It is also located at the Scottsdale mall so it makes a good pre or post shopping stop for food.

Beer is great! Food is decent. I would give the beer a 5 star but the food a 3 star.  I came in with an old friend from high school for dinner. I got their beer sampler and was surprised by the relative large size of the pours and the size of the platter the sampler comes on. For dinner I ordered one of the cheeseburgers with a side salad. The salad was incredibly disappointing, looking like it came from a cheap salad mix bag. The burger was only slightly above average, on the dry side without any defining flavors.

Aunt Chilada's is a pretty standard American Mexican place. The food was pretty basic and no frills. I would not get the quest dip because it looked and tasted like cheese whiz. My enchiladas were warm but lacked flavor as did the beans and rice it was served with. The only part I would consider getting again was the fried ice cream.
