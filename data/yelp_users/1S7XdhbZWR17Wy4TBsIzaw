Chihuly, and desert.  What a breathtaking match!  The unnatural yet organic glass paired with the desert scenery was a sight that I can't describe as anything else but just YUMMY!  The jewel tones sparkling next to each other in the sunlight was just the most ethereal sight....and I bet it's better at night.  The park itself I thought was logically laid out, and I especially loved the butterfly garden.  The hummingbird area wasn't so bad either...I got a wonderfully close up picture of an Anna's.  The only complaint I have is that they were cleaning the glass pieces as we were there.  I understand it needs to be done...but shouldn't it have been done before opening?  I don't particularly want a picture of glass cleaners in with the beautiful artwork.  Whomever said the desert was a colorless place obviously never really saw it, especially in bloom.  I always wanted to come see this place after the monsoons...but I'm glad I came during the Chihuly installation.  He truly is a master of his material.  (And yes, I know he doesn't do it all himself) I just can't get over the complementary pairing of his red reeds next to the green cacti.  And the Chiostro di Sant' Apollonia Chandelier...definitely the belle of the ball if I had to pick one.  It makes me want to go see his other garden installations around the US.  Absolutely gorgeous!  I'm putting my pictures up to share!

It's kind of nice to know that your favorite comic book store and someone involved in the comic business are out there doing some good for the world.  Mike Bullock, writer for The Phantom, helped create a line of stories called "Invisible Children" based on the civil wars happening in Uganda and what horrors the children there are facing.  They are being kidnapped by a warlord and forced to fight for his army.  How sick is that?  Last Saturday, the 11th, Mike made an appearance at Samurai Comics to make people aware of what was happening and sign books.  Proceeds of the books went toward helping these children.  Samurai also donated a percentage of their sales that day to the same cause.  A co-worker of mine is a close friend of Mike's and told me there may still be copies at the store.  If you like comics, there's nothing I can think of that's better than getting something you enjoy as well as helping others in the world.  Kudos to Samurai and Mike for donating some of their time and money to helping such a cause.  Check out the website on the Invisible Children, talking about the movement to save these children's lives.  http://www.invisiblechildren.com/home.php

Bacchanal's is another big group restaurant.  It's more fun if you have at least six people.   They have a live band, belly dancer, plate tossing, dancing barefoot in the parking lot, what more could you want?  The food is quite tasty, and the owner of the restaurant is always milling around checking to see that everyone is having a good time.   You can't help but have fun unless you're just a sourpuss.  It helps to have awesome friends to make the night even more memorable.  I seem to remember someone dancing like the Ally McBeal baby....hahahaha....

Okay...so it was my first time having tapas, and it really makes me want more.  One star for service One star for atmosphere Two stars for delicious mouthwatering tapas.  My favorites were the cuban tamales, and fried plantains.  The others were good as well, but those particularly stood out in my mind.  The tamales were a delectable mix of sweet and salty but not too much of either as to make you sick.  It actually made you want more.  One star lost out because of price.  It's quite hefty on the bankbook... but for a once-in-a-while treat, it's highly worth it.  It's really good for a date if you want to impress him or her, and a day with the girls always warrants a neat little place like this.  I know there are other locations in town, but for some reason I've heard the one in Scottsdale is the best.  All I know is, I'll drive another 45 miles just to get those tamales again!

It's like Christmas threw up in there....but in a good way.  Sure, I could only afford about 10% of the items in there, but it was a wonder to walk around and see all the millions of items available for your viewing pleasure.  There were balls, balls, and more balls!  Christmas balls, that is.  I treated myself to some teal balls.    I saw Christmas chickens, odd high heeled stockings with faux fur, freaky bald statuettes with crowns, beds that looked like they were whittled by some extremely talented but extremely bored person, a lot of bling, and lots of other things I can't even remember.    Prices ranged from very reasonable, to expensive but understandable, to ridiculously -why would anyone spend that much money on decor- priced items.  The staff was very friendly, and not at all pretentious as you might think, going into a store like that.  Rustic STUFF indeed.  I'll go now and hang my balls.  :)

I spied with my little eye: *piggy on a bike *piggy with girlfriend piggy *flying piggy *clock piggy with wagging tongue as pendulum *chef piggy (there's something wrong about a chef piggy holding pork ribs...) *beautiful tin ceiling.  No piggies in it, but plenty hanging from it.  I didn't have enough guts to try the Pork Sundae....I won't even eat the KFC chicken bowl.  I know it's all going to end up in my stomach mixed up, but I don't want it to start out that way.  The onion rings are big, crispy, and spiced with what looks like their signature rub.  Almost as good as sweet potato fries, which I was surprised (and disappointed) that they didn't have.  I'd go again just for the rings!  You can't go wrong with the ribs, pulled pork, or pulled beef.  Three words - Fall Off The Bone.  Okay, four words.  You get the point.  For dessert, the bread pudding is gooey and scrumptious.  Fried twinkie (wasn't my choice, but I guess you have to try one sometime, right?) was alright, but whoever thought up that little treat wasn't going for lo cal, that's for sure.  Not sure if it was because of so called fried twinkie, but one customer beside us suddenly for no apparent reason cried out 'WTF?' as it was delivered to his table.  It was so loud and sudden, I think I got a little bbq sauce up a nostril.    The thing that made my day:  Individually wrapped jelly bellies when you get your check.  ADORABLE!  Minus HALF a star for wierd service...a little on the slow side and the waitress waited on a party that was there after us first.  Other than that, this place is highly recommended.

If I didn't have a big pizza in front of my face, I would have thought I ordered a big serving of attitude with a side of screw you.  Maybe it's because we came in with a coupon...but this place had more ego than a 15 minute celebrity.    Not to knock small, family owned places (usually I love going to places like that, because USUALLY you get a friendly family feel), but for a pizza joint located in a shopping center next to Albertson's, they sure wanted to make you think you were eating caviar.  Things not so awesome: 1.  Whomever answered the phone didn't know East from West to be able to give directions 2.  Our waitress couldn't give any suggestions on the food 3.  They can't do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra 4.  You pay a charge if you want to split a plate of food 5.  ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE 6.  Tip was already included in our bill  I've never been to a family run pizzeria that can't do a half and half pizza, and the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you'd feel more comfortable wearing  a dress - definitely not one in a strip mall like this one.  I swear if the two waitresses rolled their eyes or huffed any more than they already did, they probably would have fainted from lack of oxygen and vertigo.  And last time I looked, I believe I was old enough to do my own math for your tip.  If you were so scared we were going to stiff you on your tip, maybe you should learn a little something called Cuss-toe-mer Sur-viss.  Foodwise, the pizza was not the best I've ever had, in fact it was a bit on the dry side.   I can't say it was absolutely horrible, but neither can I say I was in heaven.  The wings were much better, in my opinion.  For the pain of the drive and having to dodge eye daggers, this is a definite no-peat.

I'm sorry, but give me balsamic, bread, and crayons, and I'm happy.  It's probably not technically the most chic place to go, but it sure is fun after work with co-workers.  And to think the waitstaff learned to write upside down in two crayons.  That's talent.  I always seem to get an awesome wait-person and the dishes are satisfactory.  Big group of tired, overworked adults = crazy jokes and semi-loud laughing.  And we didn't even order any alcohol.  The staff didn't seem to mind us there, so we were ultra comfortable making our lunch last longer.

I always wanted to try out the place, it's so beautiful.  So when my sis and hubby came to visit, I suggested we try it out for breakfast at the Arizona Kitchen.  We were a little late for breakfast and got a lunch menu but we really wanted breakfast.  Seeing as we were the only patrons in the place, the chef agreed to turn around the kitchen back to breakfast prep.  If you've ever seen how a kitchen runs, you know it's not just flipping a switch.  I ordered the eggs benedict and was greeted with a scrumptious duo of canadian bacon, just-right eggs, and a hollandaise sauce that could make the Queen mum cry on fluffy english muffins.  But something was missing.  The black truffles that were promised...where were they?  The hostess again remedied the situation and brought back a generous helping of the decadent treat and all was good in Margaret's world.  I think I licked the plate clean.  They didn't even have to wash.  A little pricey, but what do you expect from a resort?  The truffles made up for it and especially the service.   We asked for the chef to the table so that we could offer her our compliments.  Big frou frou expensive looking chef?  NO!  LIttle Chinese woman.  Grandma!  She was more than grateful for the praise we showered on her and I think the three of us were stuffed happily to the gills.  Can't wait for another morning like that!

Mr. Lion didn't like being scolded about his treatment of the female species...but I didn't think he could hear us!  We didn't taunt, or point, or even call 'here kitty kitty'.  But still, he launched his powerful body from one end of his exhibit over to us and made everyone scream inside as he let out a mighty roar.  Everyone skipped backward except little ole me, my scream jolted to my finger on the trigger of my camera.  I would have SO been mauled.  Fortunately, the awesome zoo comes with awesome steel albeit flimsy looking fencing.  Maybe it was the perfume I was wearing, because shortly after that episode at the meerkat exhibit, one little cheeky fellow made a beeline for me, laid down on his back, and exposed his belly quite happily at me.  He rocked a bit side to side as I snapped away with my camera.  The animals always look so happy at this zoo, and you can see them far more up close than at other zoos.  Babies are always abound, including new baby ocelots.  I so want one now.  A little advice:  If you use an entertainment book, you can get one online for half price, and there are buy one get one free tickets to the zoo.  So essentially the book already paid for itself with just that one coupon.  This was my second trip to the zoo, I'm glad I have it so close by me.  I think I was as excited if not more than the little kiddies.  YAY ZOO!

The new aquarium is open!  It's an extra $6...and while I haven't visited the aquarium yet (this update is mainly to inform about the new wing), I'm raring to go and will write another update when I have gone...which hopefully will be within the next couple of weeks.  The only cons with the aquarium I've heard is that the sharks are babies yet, so not very interesting to see...but keep in mind that these places rely on visitors to help keep everything clean, running, and interesting.  How many of us could afford a full sized shark on our own?  Besides, I'm looking forward to seeing them grow up.

I finally got a chance to go to the aquarium and it didn't let me down!  Absolutely beautiful and the pride of the West side.  The exhibits are well done right down to the Rays that you can pet and feed shrimp to.  And yes, while someone might argue that there are better aquariums out there, this is the FIRST here.  I did have to demote the place to four stars because I feel like it's getting a little out of hand with the prices.  It's now $28 per person (although don't forget my entertainment book tip...that came in handy again!) and while I know they need money to stay open, it seems a little cheap that you have to pay additionally for every single ride they have.  Couldn't they at least throw in one ride for free?  And let's not even talk about the concessions...  It was also ridiculously pricey to feed the rays.  For $3 you get a small piece of shrimp cut up into thirds.  Whoopee.  Can't you hear the excitement in my voice....    While it was very cool feeling your fingers get sucked into the slippery mouths for an instant, you can pet the little buggers for FREE.  Save your $3.  I guarantee they will not starve from lack of touristy shrimp.  Here's another hint (wow, I'm so hinty today!)... If you only want to see the aquarium, you have to go after 5pm.  Otherwise you have to pay for going through the zoo too, even if you don't go through it.  If you don't want to pay for the food there and want a break, you can get a stamp on your hand before you leave, which will allow you to re-enter the park any time that day.  It sure came in handy when we all had grumbly stomachs but couldn't stomach the park food or park food prices.  That meant I went back to see the aquarium much more refreshed.  It's definitely worth a once over at the very least, and I still love this place...I just wish there was more of a feeling of getting you're money's worth.

I should know better.  I know.  McDonald's generally wouldn't get more than a three for average service, but you know sometimes you get that craving and for me, I hadn't had it in a loooong time.  Long and tiring day at work sometimes needs to be offered a little unhealthy nostalgic fast food.  It's even worse when McDonald's employees don't even care to be there.  Seriously, how hard is it to put together a burger?  My BigMac came without a piece of meat and without cheese.  When I pointed out their error, the employee giggled and shrugged her shoulders and handed me another one moments later.  Dumb.  Then they had a huge banner that said "Happy People Day" or some wierdness...signed by employees.  When I asked what it was about, they didn't even know.  Duuumb.  You have a huge banner celebrating something that you're not even sure the reason for?

Can't go wrong with a store for the fuzzles.  Kudos to Petsmart for giving me three extremely...er...lusty koi that had a blast in my pond and multiplied into at last count 20 mini koi of different colors.  I think the koi have far surpassed the reputation of rabbits....

This is one chain fast food place that I can't seem to steer clear of for some reason.  And I always order the normal sandwich.  Why change perfection?  Service at this location is quick and friendly.  Only thing to mar my experience was a shirtless guy and what looked like his mom wearing a too short skirt who sat down grumpily and yelled the "s-word" so loudly that it echoed into the kiddie play area.  I think I even saw a little girl faint in there. My appetite waned for a little until the delicious smell of the chicken sandwich wafted back to my nostrils.  I guess the food's too good for bad scenery to even stop me from chowing....although I did scarf as fast as possible so I could leave.  I mean, I know I'm not eating at a four star restaurant, but...decorum!

What NOT to order...  Vanilla ice cream with wet nuts and baby roaches.  I've been to the place two other times, and while the ice cream is better than what you might get in the grocery store (and actually in my opinion before my last visit, probably better than Cold Stone), nothing turns you off more than seeing a couple of brown specks cross your sight as you survey the selection of flavors.  When the manager was informed quietly, he came to the front , said "oh, yeah." and proceeded to smush the two moving spots with his fingers.  Okay, no ice cream for me, thanks.  They have gotten gold awards by Maricopa health inspections, and they do have award winning ice cream, but one can't help but have reservations about going back after that.  If I do go back, it will be with wide open eyes.  I may change my rating then, but for now...ew.

The staff is honest to the point of seeming put-offish.  I know it sounds wierd, but it's true.  If your body isn't right for a particular type of piericing, they won't do it.  Most people may be upset, but I'd rather a professional tell me that something isn't going to work and not get the money for it then to take my money and in a few months have something go wrong.  Once you get to know them, the owners are great.  They just don't put up with whiney frightened people who go in on a whim.  Plus they're extremely clean to the point of feeling like a hospital.  They're extremely strict on policy as well, which again may be frustrating to some who want rules bent for them, but you can bet they know what they're doing.

Charlie's + Me = Fun fun time!  I've heard some other girls have had issues with not so friendly people there and that some people make comments toward women, but I have never had that problem...nor would I care if I did hear anything, because it would far outweigh the sweeties I HAVE met there.  I know my boys would have my back!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the drag shows.  I'm not even going to say who my favorites are, because lots of them are absolutely wonderful, and have such sweet personalities to boot.  In all actuality I feel like I get stared at more by other females than anything else...and I got hit on by some cute gay boys.  Teehee!  They sure know how to make a gal feel purty.  The bartenders make awesome drinks including massively tasty midori sours...and fair warning - the jello shots are secretly deadly!  Those suckers sneak up on you.  The chicken crisps are yummy whether you are drunk or not!  The only negatives are what some others have pointed out already - the purse restriction and the music that doesn't kick up the beat until after 12 or 1.  However, since I never carry a purse with me into any club and I'm too busy watching the drag shows to care what's going on inside (besides which, you can't blame a country-western bar for playing that type of music....), these negatives really don't exist for me anyway.  I've had a blast every time I go, and I can't wait until Halloween!

Don't get me wrong with the two stars.  I still love Barro's...but this location left something for my tummy to desire...like actual pizza.  After walking down the long miles of Fry's Electronics, it was lunch time and I needed sustenance.  What better place to get it than Barro's with their slice lunch special?  Unfortunately the only slices they had - at prime lunch hour - was pepperoni and a dried sad lone slice of veggie.  At prime lunch hour.  I was one of four patrons at that point and everyone wanted sausage.  If I wanted my yummy Barro's sausage pizza, I would've had to wait 15, maybe even 25 minutes.   At prime lunch hour.  Unnnnggghhh...tummy hurting.  No thanks sucky Barro Thunderbird location.  Boo to you.  :(  Maybe....and I mean MAYBE if I'm in the area I may try this one place again, but for now you did no service to my poor stomach.

Thanks to Fry's, I felt like I was on vacation today as I traipsed around in the rainforest with the Aztec computer geeks.  There's something just cool about walking into a snake's maw to listen to stereo equipment.  The outside is just as lovely to look at.  Now as far as the store itself...  ...the cafe was a joke - out of cream cheese for their bagels.  Who runs out of cream cheese by 10am on a Saturday?  Coffee machine broken...don't they sell those things?  Couldn't they just 'demo' one from off the shelf?  ...it felt like at least half of the workers knew what they were talking about - which is actually (maybe even sadly) better than some electronics stores I've been to.  They didn't try to talk down to me because I was young or a girl.  ...prices were cheaper for some of the items I looked at  ...no restocking fee for returned electronics.  So in the end, the unique look of the store boosted it up to a four, silly enough as that sounds.  It was refreshing to be in there, and my bullsh*t radar didn't go off as loudly as it did when I was in the Baseline location.  Good thing I wasn't rating just the cafe, they would've gotten a two.

You can get drunk and get your nails painted.  Huh?  It's true, and it happens on Mondays.  For $10, you choose any martini you want.  Then, you drink and chat until it's your turn to get your hands worked on.  The chocolate martini I ordered was strong and smooth.  Definitely not watered down...just what the doctor ordered.    Okay, so the manicure wasn't something you might get at a spa, but it was a fun little silly girly thing, that I personally think is a great idea.  Still, for the price of just the martini alone, you get shiney new nails.  Not a bad deal.  The people watching is quite interesting as well, I even struck up a conversation with a humorous dad of a popular comedian.  Bring the girls and have some fun.

I think it's been summed up pretty thoroughly by others, so I'll just list a few of my favorite things.  Bare wood ceiling Beautiful views of the mountains No bad seat in the place Fire pit with little swirlies drawn in the dark sand Salt and fresh cracked black pepper in a cute yin-yang bowl Great food and even better service FREE BIRF-DAY DESSERT in the form of molten chocolate...... (they even wrote 'happy birthday' in chocolate on the plate.  Sweet!)  The only thing I could pick at is...for such a beautiful and chic place to go, did they really have to put fake horsetail in the vases at each table?  Come on now, couldn't you splurge on the real stuff?  Best lunch item:  Orecchiette pasta with shrimp, chicken, and sausage in a morrocan spice cream sauce.

I went once when it was up in Scottsdale and I probably wouldn't have gone again (Old Tucson is a lot better), but there was a huge group going and I was invited to do the Sundown Cookout.  I'd never gone before, so I thought I'd give it a little try.  First off, it's $45 and if you want first dibs on a table, you have to go early.  The first wagon rolls out at 6pm.  If you're going with a big group like I did, you'll want to reserve a table for the party.  To start the party off, you get a little short hayride pulled by horses or mules.  It was a beautiful ride watching the sun set, just a little shorter than I thought it would be.  Once there, everyone gets a straw cowboy hat and red bandana.    For food, you get your choice of steak, ribs, or chicken.  You also get a baked potato, piece of bread, and cowboy beans.  There's free lemonade, iced tea, or coffee.  After the main meal, there's apple pie and marshmallows on big long skewers that you can roast at one of the firepits.  The steak was perfectly done - extremely tender and had a good flavor.  I had the ribs and they were fall off the bone good without being too mushy.  I didn't get to try the chicken.  Everyone seemed very happy with their food.  The apple pie was pretty good.  The roasting of marshmallows was a nice touch.  I'm wavering between giving this place a 3.5 or 4 stars (I'm erring on the positive side) because it's quite expensive.  We also had to wait for a table and weren't the only ones waiting.  Beer was about $4 a bottle, soda was $2.50 a bottle.    There was also live entertainment and a little poker section as well as a play area for kids where they would pretend to rope cattle.  The band was actually pretty good.  At one point one of the actors was shooting off his gun, and one girl that must have woken on the wrong side of the bed wrinkled her nose and said that he needed to stop that.    Hellooo, we're supposed to be in the old west....ever see Tombstone?  Maybe if you didn't wear high heels in the desert you wouldn't be in such a bad mood.  But I digress.  In the end, we had fun and since I'd never been, it was a good experience.  I probably wouldn't do it again unless someone visiting from out of town really insisted and begged to see it.    By the way, I know I mentioned Old Tucson...but the benefit of Rawhide is that admission is free.  You only pay for food, drink, and souveniers...and of course the Sundown Cookout.

UPDATE:  I hate to take away a star, but they've since lost a star in my book due to inconsistancy with offerings.  What they consider their best sellers and best desserts they don't even carry all the time.  Boo.  It's rare to find a patisserie that I can rave about, especially because I do a lot of my own desserts at home.  What I look for in a good dessert:  If it's a rich dessert, it should be thick and moist or indulgently creamy.  Eating a rich dessert should make you feel sexy and naughty, like stealing a peek at a hot guy across the way to find he's looking at you too.  If it's a light dessert, it should be just sweet enough to invite you in bite after bite.  It shouldn't make you feel guilty, but it should satisfy a sweet tooth at the same time.  Arai has both for the taking.  Conveniently next to Fujiya, a cute little Japanese market, this bakery has a small selection of desserts, but what they do create, they do well.  The Green Tea Mousse is to die for, resuscitate, and die for again!  The light pillowy mousse has just enough hint of green tea to let you know what you're eating, and isn't so sweet you feel like you just invested in grills made out of sugar crystals.    It's pretty much the only thing I order there, although I've tried the fruit tart as well (delish too!) and I've heard the blueberry mousse is great, but they seem to run out when I get out there.  On top of the desserts, they offer fresh breads and cakes to order.  The staff is friendly, which is always a plus.  I can't wait to get back there to try their other offerings!

I know this place has been hailed as one of the best steakhouses to go and there's quite a bit of history that goes along with it, but the service and food I received when I went was all hype and no bite.  I went with two others and we all ordered the filet minon.  Now mind you, I've never been a huge steak person mainly because most restaurants mess it up by over cooking or leaving a big hunk of oily fat staring at you.  But I thought since this place had such good feedback, I'd try it.  First off, two of the filets we ordered were not filets.  They were end cuts that were shaped to look like fillets with blops of fat squeezing from the sides.  We thought maybe it was a mistake, and the chef didn't realize they gave us a bad cut.  So we set the plates back.  Two new plates arrived with the same exact cuts.  Now I was mad.  We weren't being difficult, but I'm certainly not going to pay $25 for a piece of stew meat.  And to do it twice?  Seriously, that's just rude.  The waiter was extremely apologetic and told us he'd get the manager for us so that she could see what we were being served.  First off, I don't complain to get free stuff.  I just want them to fix what's wrong so I can have my meal, and then I'll be happy.  The manager came over, said she was sorry we weren't happy and that she would take off the meal from the ticket and took the plates.    She didn't offer a different meal She didn't offer consolation She didn't offer a new filet.  So we suddenly had no dinner.  I have never been treated like that in a restaurant before and was completely stunned.  We weren't rude, we weren't screaming at her, we didn't throw food....  Maybe others have had better experiences there, but as for me, I won't even give it a second chance.

Nice selection of furniture all different types of styles at some pretty good deals.  But boy does their customer service SUCK suck suck suuuuuuck.  I went in sometime at the end of April to purchase an office desk and dining set, seeing as I still have dorm type furniture in my house.  They even gave me a discount on the desk and I found the perfect dining set with six chairs.  Everything was set to deliver.  I was happy.  Delivery day comes and everything is here except 2 chairs.  Then came the non-stop problems.  I had four chairs instead of 6, and 2 of those chairs were floor models which I was promised again and again that I would get brand new chairs.  They even had butt stains on the cushions.  GROSS!  Then, when we opened the table, we found the supports were cracked.  I drove the table down to the store to exchange the table to find that the only other table had a large crack on the entire top side.  So after a little fussing they agreed to put the good support onto the good top and I took the table home.  While there, we also checked up on the missing chairs at which point they found out no one even ordered my other chairs.  Now came the non-stop lies.  Lie #1:  We are ordering your chairs now. Lie #2:  We'll call you when we find out more. 3 weeks later.... Lie #3-6:  Oh, no one ordered your chairs again.  We'll order it now. Lie #7-10:  We'll call you. Yes, they found out at least 3 or 4 times that someone I talked to who promised to order the chairs didn't, and yes, every time...and I seriously mean every time someone promised to call me, they didn't. 2 weeks later...  Arguing with the lady that THEY have to deliver the chairs since it was their fault they didn't order and deliver them with the first lot.  After huffing and making it sound like it was my fault, she made the delivery date.  Chairs came...and they're the WRONG COLOR.  Now the deal is that the manufacturer has changed their materials so I won't find any chairs to match my table.  Fine, I'll find another chair to match.  So I drive there for the 5th time...of course, the chair I find happens to be more expensive than the originals, but they truly are the only ones that match.  Even after all the stupidity I'm willing to work with them if they want me to pay a little to make up the difference.  You'd think that after all this they know that they had better call when they promise because that is the exact behavior I'd been complaining about each time, and they put on their pretend smiles and pretend sympathetic voice.  They don't call again They don't deliver on time again - they didn't even schedule the delivery date in their computers even though I have a copy.  Okay, now I'm definitely not paying the difference for the chairs.  So after all of that....I finally got my chairs YESTERDAY.  Fortunately, they didn't argue price.  I wouldn't shop there again if my life depended on it.  Maybe if you spend $4,000 and above, they'll treat you nicely.  Hasn't anyone ever heard of POST-IT notes?  For the love of Jeebus!

Oh my shaky knees.  Raspberry rugalah that's not too fruity and melts in your mouth. Pignoli (that's pine nut cookies) with rich almond flavor and chewy in the middle. Cream puffs bigger than your fist. And like the other review said, lots more!  You'd think you died and went to bakery heaven.  I'm really picky when it comes to cookies, but I can't stay away from these.  I bought a naughty box for myself yesterday.    Mine, all mine!

So I got a new camera, and I'm an SLR virgin.  Where to go?  I hate going to the big electronics stores unless I know exactly what I'm looking for.  For some really odd reason I don't like to be talked down to, especially by someone who thinks they are almighty Technogenius.  Working at Best Buy.  So I took my little ole self to this small private camera shop and not only walked out feeling more confident in my SLR skills, but never felt pressured.  Some things were more expensive than the big stores, but the guy definitely knows his stuff and sometimes you can find a good deal.  Plus he's not stingy with his knowledge.  So there, Best Buy.  So there.

Yelpers didn't let me down!  When my girlfriend suggested we head to this place for a little sushi, I immediately did a little research and was pleased to see what great ratings were earned.  I also did a little research online.  Since it was Sunday, we wore blue and got 50% off our drinks.  Cute concept!  Blue wasabi...heheh...genius.  It looked like play-doh....  The plethora of unique martinis made me spin with confusion until I asked our nice waiter.  He recommended the Lemon Rasperry Ice.  A little sweet, a little sour, a lot of Mmmm!  It's mighty dangerous however, since you can't really taste the liquor....unfortunately, my genes make me turn a little crimson when I get a little alkihawl...so as a human alcohol beacon, I could tell it was definitely potent.  No watering down here!  The sushi menu has traditional items on one side (boring) and inventive fusionistic items on the other (why not?)....so of course we turned to the dark side.  Killer Bee made sense when I saw it plated.  And as an eel lover, I savored every sweet and succulent piece that tickled my tongue.  It's my new favorite.  I can't even remember the other rolls we tried, I keep thinking of that Bee.  But I do know they didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth.  Cool blue ambience Neat bathroom sink fixtures (I notice those wierd things) Cushy blue seats Mondrian-esque blue background behind the bar $9 Martinis that went to $4.50 for wearing blue  Definitely a must do again!

Oh Feztini, you're so sweet you made me blush....or maybe it was the three kinds of alcohol that did it.    Your savory friends were just as pleasing...what with the seafood kibis (like a crab cake, but it didn't make me break out in hives...I think I found a new love!) and the chicken phyllo packets.  But what made both of them that much better was the pesto aioli and roasted red pepper aioli that went with them.  How is it that when you put 'aioli' at the end of something, it's always SO good?    Then, there's my new BFF, the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich. Moist chicken breast, creamy salty goat cheese, and sweet cherries, pears, and raspberry vinaigrette...does that just make your mouth water?  Everyone was very happy with their order, and I did get a chance to try a piece of the lamb kisra.  The lamb was so moist and flavorful, if I weren't already bursting full, I might have wanted one.  That one's for my next visit, for sure.  The decor is spectacular.  I was tempted to try to sneak out with one of those adorable green stools.  The glass panels were tre-chic...I only wish I had the same look in my studio.  I also have to make mention that our server was very nice and attentive.  She never hesitated to make sure we were all happy.  And as if this place couldn't get any better, I finally got to meet Thomas!    My friends and I had an absolutely wonderful night...Fez definitely didn't disappoint.  Oh...and just one warning.  If you get the garlic fries....don't bother with gum.  It won't help.  But they're damn good!

Chic, chic, and more chic.  Decor:  Pale blue booths and chocolate tables, an upholstered wall, charming stripped huge floor lamps.  To sum it up, clean, simple, and fresh. (I was kind of disappointed in the bathroom decor, though...)  Wine:  A wonderfully large selection of various wines - including a nice bright Reisling that I decided to try.  I can't even remember the name, except it's the first one on their list, and it was one of the best  Reislings I've had in awhile.  Not too dry, and tongue tingling.  Food:  Like the decor, is clean, fresh, and tasteful.  I split the bow-tie chicken pasta with tomatoes, spinach, and pine nuts and the cobb salad with my friend.  Both were extremely satisfying, but I have to say I almost liked the cobb salad better.  Almost.  The thing that made it so tasty was the wonderful poppyseed viniagrette that came with it.  It didn't hurt that it had big chunks of avocado, chicken, and just a touch of bacon and egg; just enough to taste, not overpower.  My friend's mother had the Everything salad, and her aunt had the Maine lobster salad.  Both seemed extremely satisfied.  The really impressive part, was that our server must have overheard us talk about our birthday, because when we ordered dessert, (we had to get the Bars of Sin...who wouldn't want that?) the plate came with the words Happy Birthday in chocolate.  So what are these Bars of Sin?  Decadent chocolate mousse on top of some wafer like bottom, all covered in a thin chocolate ganache.  Pair that with vanilla bean gelato, and this is one sin that'll take you to heaven.  The prices were about the same as some other places I've been to; a little up there, but we had big portions and everything was very tasty.   I'd probably go more for lunch than dinner, but I definitely recommend this place.

Great customer service, good prices for quality art supplies.  It ranks right up there with Dick Blick.  My only complaint is that their catalog isn't as yummy as some other art supply places.

It's hard to believe it's not a huge chain bookstore, but I totally agree with other reviewers who also loved the place.  I've been really wanting a good book to read for awhile, and having exhausted common 'bestsellers' and authors I've read for awhile, I wanted to find a new author to be a fan of.  Changing Hands has great suggestions that make you believe they don't have an ulterior motive for choosing those books (what, they actually read it and didn't steal the idea from Oprah's book club?), they even include a little blurb summarizing the gist of said books.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff, comfortable clean environment in which to peruse your books to your heart's content.  I only wish I had one closer to me...although today's hour long drive was worth it.  Just don't go for the Harry Potter midnight sale tonight unless you like chaos.  Yikes!

Ditto all the previous reviews, I've been to this place 3 times now and have never been disappointed.  This time I shared the Bartlett Pear and Black Forest sandwich. And of course potato pancakes. For dessert, we shared an apple strudel.  Absolutely Scrumptious!  I've had the Hefeweizen before...yummmm.  I love the new place, and can't wait to go again!

Here's some advice:  If you're in a small cute little bistro, please PLEASE refrain from throwing your head back and laughing as loud as your lungs will accomodate you.  Not to say you need to ruin your fun...but GAWD DANG it can be loud in the ears!  And when I'm trying to have a nice conversation with two friends and can't hear them when we're all talking above "inside voice" level, it can get quite annoying.  It seemed that my ears tried to squeeze themselves into my head!  That said...  The awesomness that was Harley's included a cutie-patootie server by the name of Justin who made you feel right at home, bread (as it seems everyone else who yelped enjoyed), and my entree.  *wiping drool*  So I ordered the Bistro Chicken.  It was chickeny!  I was spinachey!  It was creamy saucee...e.  In other words, It was roll your eyes in back of your head, sit back in your seat, and melt in all of its goodness.  The proportions of ingredients were extremely generous.  None of that $13 all pasta and five pieces of chicken nonsense you get at some places.  My ONLY critique is that I wished what seemed like 12 cloves of garlic hiding along my journey of tastiness were roasted as opposed to au natural.  Mind you, this is only a teensy tiny critique.  Conclusion:  It's got reasonable Bistro prices with none of the pretentiousness of the staff.  Loved our waiter.  One plate could serve two people comfortably.  Can't wait to return with my guys to try out the Tiramisu!

Long live the free sample.  Never had any problems with parking, or waiting in line to pay even at the gas pumps...maybe I'm just lucky.  And where else can your tummy growl and get immediate satisfaction in the form of chocolate milk, tamales, pizza, and ravioli in teensy little cups that make you feel a little naughty when you take one?  As if you somehow need to sneak off into some dark corner of the store with your five items snickering to yourself as you gobble them up...  No need for lunch when you're shopping here!

Fresh Mozarella......check. Good Balsamic.......check. Heirloom Tomatoes.....check.  Just needed fresh basil for a yummy caprese salad.  Sprouts sells a large bag for almost $4 as opposed to other places that sell those little tiny plastic containers for almost $3.  The only drawback was they've been out for about a month and I can never find it.  When the manager was asked, he said he would look into it, apologized and handed me 4 of the little containers for FREE!  How sweet is that?  Abashedly, I had to accept.  It reminded me of another situation at the same store when the deli ran out of gyro meat.  In actuality, she was too lazy to go back and cut more.  The manager checked and sure enough found a huge hard to miss hunk and made the lady cut four packages of the stuff for me.  He wouldn't allow me to pay for them, so I ended up with enough gyro meat to feed the world gyros!  So one star less only because other employees made me have to talk to a manager, but great reviews for wonderful customer service on behalf of the manager.  Now THAT is what keeps a customer coming back!

I've come to the realization that some of the best restaurants are squished into shopping centers.  White Eagle is a little polish deli that has a lot in a small area.  In the back corner is a little market where you can get Scandinavian, Polish, German...etc. sweets and goodies.  In the front corner is the restaurant part, and opposite is the deli counter that holds all sorts of yummy desserts, deli meats, and fresh baked breads.  I've taken the breads home plenty of times.  Crusty on the outside, soft and squishy in the middle.  Best of both worlds.  The desserts are the best, and my favorite is a little heavenly number which is yet un-named...  It's a sandwich of light soft pastry that has layers like filo, but is much lighter...with a middle of the fluffiest custard cream.  Just sweet enough.  Then you get to the menu, littered with various hunter's stews, schnitzels, and probably the best pierogies I've tasted.  They have three kinds:  meat and rice, potato and cheese, and of course sauerkraut and mushrooms.  The latter two are my favorite.  One order comes with 9 pieces, and you can mix and match.  The restaurant is family owned, and every one of them are friendly and will answer any of your questions.  They close at 3:30pm and are closed on Sundays.  I haven't tried breakfast there yet...but it sounds appetizing.

Probably one of my favorite pizza places because of the crust.  Nothing says yummy for da tummy like crusty crust that's nice and chewy in the center.  It's thick enough that it doesn't get sopping wet from sauce and juice, yet not so thick you think you just got a mouthful of dough.  I'm a bit of a plainster - the sausage is good enough for me.  Best honey bbq wings I've had, too.  Crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside, and they seem to give me more wing parts than mini drumettes whenever I go there, which I love.  And ooey gooey finger lickin' sauce...that's the stuff.  Just don't order the lunch special unless you know for a fact the pre-made pizza is fresh.  Last time they told me it was fresh I ordered it only to find it dried out from the heat lamp.  Bleh.  Only happened once though in all the times I've gone.

You always know good Chinese food when the people in the kitchen are telling jokes in Cantonese.  You know how good it is?  It's SO good, when I took my visiting parents, my dad actually stopped eating, went to the counter, and complimented the chef.  Now that's good.  The best menu item by far is the lo mein.  It doesn't matter which one, they have chicken, pork, shrimp, or just veggie.  It's not overly oily, and that luscious aroma from using a wok just can't be beat.  You feel healthy and naughty all at the same time.    Every time I get an urge for good Chinese food and don't feel like cooking, that's where I head!

This place is disgusting!  Stay far far (so that it's all mine...mwa ha ha haaa....) away!  Disregard my four stars!  IMO, soul food can be really really good, or it can be really really bad.  With a little coaxing from a co-worker, we decided to go head over there to decide once and for all.  The menu is a little confusing, but if you go with a veteran or ask, it starts to make some sense.  There's all sorts of things that look tempting, but for my first try, I go with the southern fried chicken with mac and cheese and fried corn.  One of the gals with me gets the smothered pork chop....and loves every bite of it.  Not bad...  On my second visit, I've now tried the Grandma's Gumbo.  I wish I had gotten that the first time....Grandma sure knew what she was doing.  Even my Louisiana friend who tried a bite was swooning.  The Gumbo is a nice rich broth and sneakily hides all of its goodies within.  As you start to stir the gumbo around, you start to see big gigantic chunks of shrimp (perfectly cooked), spicy sausage, actual crab legs (claw parts too, not just the stick legs that would embarrass any self respecting crab), and the flavors just meld together so well.  All this is served on the gooeyest rice ever.  Absolute delishisness!  But I'm not here to talk about the Gumbo, for there is yet another tempting treat that I've so far gotten five people hooked to.  This disgustingly yummy treat goes by the name of Peach Cobbler.  It's a cobbler like no other I've ever had.  Not to mention the creamy scoop of vanilla ice cream you can get with it.  The only thing holding me back from tacking on five stars is that it is a little pricey for some items, but then again, it's not fast food.  Also, wait for your food is a little strange, especially when you're with a party.  Not everyone's dishes come out all at once.    Great all around comfort food in a comfy setting.  It's a nice getaway from the job, that's for sure.

I loathe you oh AAS for you tooketh all my finances.  Okay so I gave willingly.  Bad art store....bad.  Awesome for book binding supplies not to mention staff full of knowledge and free tips.  If they don't have the stuff, they get it shipped to their store from other locations in town without cost to me.  Other art materials seem a teensy bit pricey, but they give discounts to artists (and teachers).

For $5 a person you get to learn a little of local history.  Did you know there is a large petroglyph and pictograph site right here in Phoenix?    You walk around with a map and locate various rocks and read about the history of the people who decorated the area with the symbols.  It's educational and fascinating.  We had the luck of running into the ranger by the name of Desert Little Bear Gonzales who took us on a personal tour since he wasn't doing anything at the moment.  He told us more history than the literature offered and even pointed out a large owl sitting in a tree.  He shined a mirror at it to catch its attention and told us about the wildlife in the area.  It was enchanting listening to his stories.  You could tell he really enjoyed what he was doing.  I've even thought about having him speak in my class.  If you want to learn a little about Arizona, I'd suggest stopping by.  It's cheap (the money goes toward preservation of the area, also), and close by and worth at least one visit.

Here in the desert, you can either turn your home into a Russian sweat lodge (that Halls commercial comes to mind..."Breathe, my friend, breathe!") or risk burning every electrical tower in a 15 mile vicinity in an effort to stave off 116 degree weather that just seems to linger when you're trying to sleep at night.  One option is to put solar screens on the windows.  It's quite an expense, but it's kind of necessary in Arizona.  Plus it pays for itself in just two years.  After three estimates, I decided to go with AESP.  Reason 1:  The owner himself came to talk to me Reason 2:  He explained everything in layman's terms and didn't try to up-sell anything Reason 3:  He promised to have the job done in two days Reason 4:  He gave me a great discount and threw in some items for free.  If you're in the market for sunscreens, I'd suggest giving this company a call.  It's family run (mom answers phones, brother installs...)  The common terms are 80% or 90%, which means just how much you want to block.  80% lets in more light than 90%, but also more heat.  90% blocks out more, but makes the house darker.  But in reality, I've adjusted to the point that I don't notice much difference until I go outside.   AESP does not take ANY money until the job is completely done and to satisfaction.  That means the job won't get partially done, then left to sit for days making you wonder if they'll ever come back or if they just took your money and ran.  So far, I've shaved 15% off of my electricity bill in just the two weeks I've had them up.  Doesn't sound like much, but do the math.  Even if I average around 20% per month, that's a lot of money in my pocket.  Including tax incentives (you get a tax break for any items that help energy efficiency)....  More money to spend on food!  Who can complain?

Actually, this place falls between a 3 and 4 depending on the visit.  Along with normal pet supplies, you can also adopt dogs, ducks, various caged birds, bunnies, chinchillas, pea fowl (yes, I did say it), turkeys, quail, roosters, pot bellied pigs, goats, fancy pigeons....and on and on....  If you're an animal lover like me, you get mixed feelings going into a store that has pets in cages and boxes.  Pratt's is much better at the showing of animals, big dogs aren't stuffed into kennels meant for teacup chihuahuas, and save for one visit when I saw a parrot picking himself naked, the animals look healthy and happy.  If you don't mind the possibility of getting pooped or peed on, you can pick up and pet the silky soft rabbits and the cute little baby ducks.  In the back, you can see a white peahen and a couple of multicolored peacocks.  Prices are slightly more expensive than say Petsmart, but it's a locally owned small store with lots of animals you can play with.  I hate to admit it but I've never bought anything.  I just go there to get my fuzzy animal need out of the system.  They probably see me come in now and think "there goes that crazy girl again making a beeline for the ducks..."  The staff is really friendly and don't mind your grubby hands all over their animals.  They currently have a little boxer puppy for sale who seems to like squashing his face all over the glass and making funny faces at you.  Almost tempted....but I don't think my cats would appreciate it.

You know it's family run when you hear the staff arguing with each other behind the counter while little old dad is slowly wiping each table, grinning happily at you as you sink your teeth into one of their bagels.  Can't help but grin back, gloppy cream cheese on the mouth or not.  Empire is a humble little place offering fresh bagles and cream cheeses.  Does it compare to Einstein Bros?  I do love Einstein's, and they do have more to choose from, but since there isn't any by me, Empire Bagels is the next best thing.  Bagels are that perfect combo of crisp and chewy goodness and deli meats are cut on request.  Cream cheese helping is extremely generous.  The chicken salad is not too mayonnaisey, with big chunks of white meat.  You actually taste the chicken, not the celery.  One chicken salad bagel will run you $5.75 including a little pasta or potato salad.  The most expensive bagel will run you about $7 and has the works.  Great fresh bagel place for the west valley with an irresistably cute New York flair.

Not sure why everyone keeps raving about this place....  After much insistence, I gave up and went to see what all the hoopla was about.  Going during the dinner rush, I was immediately crushed both in front and back with families of 6 to 8.  No one ever brought bread to our table even though all the tables around us were served at least two or three times.  We requested bread four times and had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  Still no bread, and I ran out of water so consistently that I had to swallow the food dry.  The roast was cut with the grain, making it inedible.  Veggies were overcooked.  The famous steaks people are always talking about were nowhere to be seen since they closed the grill.  As we left, the manager must have seen the unhappy look on our faces and asked if there was anything he could do.  We explained what happened to which he apologized and said that if we sat back down, he would make sure bread came to us.  Yeah, cuz the bread is SO good we want to go sit back down and wait for possibly forever again.  GUH!  Thanks, but no thanks...ever again.

I'm so excited Paradise Bakery finally came to me!  A really great place to get different sandwiches, soups, and salads extremely fresh.  The turkey cranberry sandwich is my true favorite.  It's Thanksgiving in a nice little molassas bread package.  And how can you go wrong with a free chocolate chip cookie?  Soft in the middle, chewy crisp on the edges, and oodles of melty chocolate chips.  Chocolate good.  The fire roasted tomato soup is also a nice sweet and tart warm treat complete with a little sour cream and crispy tortilla strips served on top.  Since this is a new location however, everyone in Surprise has now flocked over, so it's highly suggested you figure out what you want to get before you get there.  It felt like I was at a cow auction, everyone yelling their orders over the counter.  Yikes, can we say sardines in a can??  The staff was good natured and fast, so it made up for the tumble of people.  Plus samples of their tempting delights awaited you as you slid your tray down the line.  Free stuff good.

Did you know you could grow Lychees in the desert?  I sure didn't....until I went to this little unassuming nursery which is also called Alex's Tropicals.  I met Alex when I decided I wanted to try to grow bananas in my back yard.  Not only for fruit, but for some reason when the houses were built, my neighbor's driveway angles upward so at any given moment if I'm in the backyard, I see heads bobbing up and down on the other side of the wall.  Nothing against my neighbors, but there's something to be said about a little privacy in one's own backyard.  So Alex recommended a couple of banana species - and even gave one plant free after one of them died on the first occasion - and happily they are shooting up so fast and healthy I will soon have my screen.  On top of the great customer service, the nursery is a neat place to just go and look at the different types of fruit trees they sell.  Everything from cherries to dragon fruit, lychee, pineapple, loquats, mangoes, papayas, etc. etc. etc....  It's mind numbing the varieties they have, and the place isn't even that large compared to other nurseries in town.  Prices are more than fair, and everyone I've encountered there is extremely well informed and will answer any of your plant questions patiently.  Their website is even cooler.  I hope it gets finished soon, but you can't blame them for not having it completed with all of the info they're cramming on the site.

Honest, and friendly.  What more could a girl want?  Especially when it comes to taking care of your car.  I brought in my car to get a brake check and Robert was extremely helpful.  I didn't feel like he gave me any lines or tried to take advantage of the fact that I was of the female persuasion.  In fact, instead of fixing my brake and taking my money, he told me that the issue should be fixed under warranty still.  He even told me the best way to deal with the dealership to ensure they didn't try to skirt their responsibility.  I watched the way they interacted with customers also, and found that they had an extremely good rapport, especially for a place that has been only opened for a couple of months.  I'm definitely going back for any other service I may need in the future.

Creamy, luscious, divine...just some of the words that barely describe the wonderfulness that is Ritter's frozen custard.   Short of having real Italian gelato (never been to Italy yet, so I can't even begin to compare the schtuff we have here), this frozen custard beats everything this side of town.  Mix-ins, schmixins.  The custard's yummy with or without.  It's more flavorful than teeth loosening sweet and they have over 65 to choose from...although they rotate around about 6 of them per day.  It sure makes the moody blues go bye-bye with each spoonful.  Okay, I'm being a little over-dramatic.  But it really is good!  Price is right, service is great, and it would take a long time before you became bored with the flavors.  You could literally go every day and try something new.  Bad for hips, good for the little kid in all of us.

Smooth jazz and good food makes a night a little extra special.    This is Mike's Restaurant no longer.  Yorman has taken over and turned it into what they call "Southern Fusion".  On either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday you can listen to live jazz as you eat, played by Yorman himself and his band as well as friends from out of town who come solely to play with Yorman.  The food itself was pretty tasty.  My lamb shank was fall off the bone tender and the sweet mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth.  The Chick Corea was wonderfully tender.  The Hanna Bay Rum Runner - chicken encrusted in pecan served in a sweet rum sauce - was alright, although I thought it would have been much better.  And it wasn't served in a sweet rum sauce...the waitress claims the chef drizzled it on top, but it came rather dry.  Dessert came in the form of homemade peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream made by Yorman's wife herself.  Tasty little number.  All in all, the prices were decent, service was good.  What gives that extra star was the live jazz.  I think if I had gone on a regular night this place would have received three stars.

Naked coffee beans get hot and bothered right in the store and then get in a bit of a grind.  Nice mix of hot and cold choices on the menu and tempting desserts mocking you from their glass confines.  Of course I had to try the Black Dragon...a blended iced coffee mocha with a little kiss of cherry flavoring.  Y U M.  The owner was extremely nice too, always helps.  So for my first visit, I was very happy.  I didn't give a five star only because I only tried one drink so far.  I'm sure it'll be changing soon, plus I'd rather support a local business like his than Star"lots-o"bucks.

Baklava Cheesecake.  That's all I have to say.  Okay, no there's more.  Graham cracker crust with a thin layer of filo, then thick NY style cheesecake...cinnamon, crushed pistachio nuts, shredded filo on top, sitting on top of a light drizzle of honey with more crushed pistachio decorating the plate.  So good that the meal before it seems like a dim memory...although the gyros are pretty darn tasty too.  Succulent pieces of lamb, thick fluffy pita.  You have to ask for feta on the side otherwise it doesn't come with any.  Also tried the avgolemono soup...creamy chicken rice lemon soup.  Unfortunately, this one was the deal breaker.  The chicken was old and multi-colored and the soup was a little too sour.  I've had it before and really like it normally.  I just don't like it making my mouth turn inside out.  Another sour note was what seemed like the manager yelling in the open kitchen asking his staff if he could meet their girlfriends and how old they were.  Ooooo-kay.  I didn't realize I was in My Big Fat Greek Real World.  The good news was the soup was first, and the cheesecake was last, so I left an extremely happy Margaret.  The waiter was really nice about the soup, and very attentive.  Good enough to make me want to go back sometime.

...as Johnny Depp leans forward, placing a morsel of dark chocolate to my lips...  ...oh...er...sorry, was I daydreaming?  *blush*  Ha ha...silly me.  Although your senses do get a bit of a shock when you first walk in to Chocolate Surprise.  It's a small shop near Brookside Bar & Grill that's easy to miss but definitely hard to forget.  More like an art museum than a chocolatier, you immediately are greeted by a showcase of their chocolate offerings displayed so beautifully that I wanted to try every one of them.  At $1.50 per truffle, it's not a cheap food, but treating oneself once in awhile is a must.  Look at it this way - the prices make you want to pick up a few, but not go on a chocolate binge to ruin the 2 hour workout.  Their menu is like ordering sushi.  All of their truffles are listed with a brief explanation.  Everything is handmade at the location and handpainted by the two Masters of Chocolate...even down to a miniature "abstract" painting, in the words of Stan, one of the owners.  So now we get down to the nitty gritty...how does it taste?  The Green Tea Truffle was by far my favorite.  If you like dark chocolate and the light fragrant scent of green tea, you'll love this one.  Yum!  My second favorite was the Thai Tea Truffle mainly because at first you didn't notice the tea flavor, and suddenly on an inhale, the flavor completely permeated around my mouth.  Third was the Hazelnut Toffee Truffle.  Hazelnut and Toffee...match made in chocolate heaven.  Fourth was the Passionfruit Truffle.  You could definitely taste the passionfruit, although it too kind of snuck up.  Fifth - the Arboli Truffle.  While it was an ok taste, I would have liked the chili flavor to have been slightly more pronounced.  In tie for sixth place was the Rose Truffle and Caramel Sushi.  The Rose Truffle was supposed to be infused with rose nectar, but it was so light the chocolate overpowered anything else.  The caramel sushi while still tasty was only a miniature rice crispy with thick (albeit good) caramel on top.  Both didn't really excite me much.  They have many other flavors and I look forward to returning to try some others.  The owners were wonderful to talk to and really seemed knowledgeable.  Definitely not art snobs, although they are extremely proud of their work, and have every right to be.  This shop is a luxury for sure, but something that my eyes, nose, and definitely my tongue will long for.  Johnny Depp or not.  ~le sigh~

My mouth was definitely amused.  And in a good way.  Before my visit I pictured a French style pretentious little place.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't go in with bad thoughts, that's just what came to mind with the name.  But when we walked in, the place and especially the people were anything BUT pretentious and the food was anything but just French.  Sure, there were the French staples like quiche and croissants...but then there was freshly made hummus, fritattas, paninis, and the biggest shocker, burnt ends sandwiches.  Not to mention a good selection of tempting desserts (oh yeah).  The owners were extremely nice and had the cutest little daughter with them that just made you laugh as she gave her 'dadda' raspberries on his neck as he held her, and pointed at the desserts murmuring gleefully 'chocolate'.  A girl after my own heart.  Definitely a family friendly place.  It seemed everyone that worked there had such a good relationship with each other.  They gave samples as freely as their smiles and recommendations.  The hummus was so obviously deliciously fresh, and had the wonderful aroma of garlic.  It's the first time I ever ate hummus by the spoonful.  I could never do that with the store bought stuff.  Yuck.  But this stuff...this was the shiznits!  The lamb panini was oozing caramelized onions and aioli mayo with tender shavings of perfectly cooked lamb on a chewy crusty baguette.  I know, baguette and panini...doesn't seem right...but it was delish.  It came with a side of fresh greens drizzled with balsamic, sprinkled with candied pecans.  Yummers.  The artichoke fritatta was pretty tasty, although I wish it would have been a larger portion for the price.  Fritatta eater wasn't as pleased as I was with my panini.  We tried the creamed green chili soup while there also...that had a mild little bite to it and was yummy as well, but I decided to forgo the soup for tonight.  The piece de resistance had to be the chocolate torte.  Smooth dark Belgian chocolate in a flaky crust.  It just slid right down my throat and gave my tummy a big hug.  Amuse Bouche is actually a take-out / catering restaurant.  Just keep in mind if you take out, it's not a fast food restaurant so you'll be waiting a little for your food.  I didn't mind at all since the people there just chatted with us while the food was being prepared.  The menu changes daily, so you're bound to find something tasty every day.  Synopsis:  A second, third, fourth....maybe more...visit is definitely in my future.  For about a dollar more than McDonald's (remember, the people who didn't know who People Day was even though they made the sign) you can get fresh food that is a whole heck of a lot healthier and tastier.  They even have imported drinks if you're in the mood to try.  Amuse my Bouche anytime!

Two words:  Boba Supplies.  I agree with pretty much everything in the other reviews, so I'll keep it short.  I got a trunk load of stuff for cheeeep!  Sometimes I want and crave a Boba drink, but don't have anywhere by me that sells them...and don't necessarily want to spend money on it.  Kind of the Starbucks mentality.  I got Boba, drink mixes, and straws all at Lee Lee's.  For the cost of one drink, I can make 10!  I'm seriously thinking about having a Boba party.    BOBALICIOUS!

So I admit I looked over my shoulder a bit when I went to this place...it's not an area I'd go to by myself.  But as most eateries go, this little hole in the wall was mighty tasty.  A whole rack of baby back ribs is enough for two people and comes with two sides.  They smoke their own ribs and it's definitely evident in the taste.  The ribs were perfectly cooked and juicy with a nice tangy sauce that wasn't too sweet.    Besides ribs, they do brisket, chicken, st. louis ribs, etc.  They added a little brisket for free in with the order so that we could taste it, too.  The brisket was not as good as the ribs, but it had a good flavor.  The mexican cornbread is moist and corny with bits of jalapeno in the mix just for a little bite.  The corn on the cob...was cobby.  The potato salad was cold mashed potatoes with hard boiled egg, peppers, and whatever else.  It looked like someone pre-chewed it for me.   Despite the strange look of it, it wasn't half bad.  I wouldn't call it the best I've had, by any means.  The beans...ick.  At least in my opinion.  It just didn't seem to go with the bbq as well.  The staff was very informative and the fact that they threw in something for free just so a customer could try it tells me that they are confident in what they do...and it shows in the food.  Price wise they aren't cheaper than other bbq restaurants, although they do often have coupons which I wasn't able to find the other night, but I'll definitely look for them next time I go back.  Ribliscious!

Minus 1 star for crunchy rice.  What is it about Chinese restaurants with crunchy rice?  So far I've tried the orange peel chicken (WAYYYYY better than Panda Express, imo), mongolian beef (okay, but really nothing to squeal about), tomato beef (would've liked for it to be a little sweeter, but other than that, it was goooood), egg rolls (small but yummy), and egg drop soup (same as any restaurant).  There's a reason the orange peel chicken is one of their house specials.  Moist pieces of white meat buckk-erk with a satisfyingly crunchy battered outside smothered in a slightly spicy tangy sweet orange peel sauce.  Freak-en awesome.  My advice:  If you have a rice cooker, make your own.   Take-out is better than eating in...it's a small cramped little restaurant, and lines tend to form outside.  If you want to eat there, go early.    The lunch special with food enough for two averages about $5.50.  Don't trust the fortune cookies.   Confucious does NOT say.

Where else can you get a look that says "hooker-liscious" all the way to "funky grandma" in one place?  I ended up with a found pair of sleek boots for less than $15, a free sno-cone (much needed in this heat!), and some green socks.  But trust me, I could have spent a lot more.  Cute skull stuff, awesome bling canopy in the ceiling, the sweetest shopkeeper you could ever find...  I left with a lemon-lime sticky smile plastered on my face...knowing I'll definitely be back!

Had to sit on the White Sox side...  The owner was extremely laid back and friendly, and had a great sense of humor.  He played host and server all at once and treated everyone like friends and family.  Sliders with Cheese - I wish the cheese was a little bigger, it was about a inch square in size.  It was like a doll blanket draped over Andre the Giant.  The meat was juicy and three sliders were plenty of food.  Chicago Style Dog - Plenty of celery salt.  Tamale Boat (aka the Belly Bomb) Gross but Oh So Yum drenched in chili, cheese, and onion.  The "Zero calorie" (so says the owner) cheesecake on a stick would have been better a little less frozen, but that's not his fault.  He even came out of the kitchen with a gigantic chef's knife to help cut the frozen treat.  Great place to go for authentic Chicago fare even if you're not a Sox or Cubs fan. I'll definitely go back again.

For a retirement community restaurant, it's pretty decent.  But I've only gone because our prom happened to be right next door.  The Goods:  1. Eat dinner whilst watching geese waddling to and fro and families of bunnies hopping across the green...sometimes you might even spot a heron trying to catch fish in the lake (last night a baby bunny sat so close to me with only a thin pane of glass separating us.  CUTE!)  2. Free half order of their specialty onion rings (coupon in the paper)  3. $2 Manhattans  4. No screaming babies and kids running around (since it's in Sun City Grand)  5. Addictively tasty green beans  The only negative that happened to us was one order of burnt ends that were neither yummily burnt nor ends.  It just seemed like old cuts of beef with bbq sauce.  My dinner was good though.  I could only eat half, the portion was huge!

I can't really rate the place as a resort because I was there for a graduation.  However, the areas I went and the staff I encountered were wonderful.  **Edit:  For my critic** The decor was somewhat Las Vegas-ey in that the carpet was a little mind numbing if you stared at it for far too long, but it definitely fits the local.  One person described it as 'bright and hot'.  Our banquet was wonderful, servers were extremely attentive.  The food was decent, but what really stood out was the decadent chocolate cake that was much too rich for one person to finish.  Most everyone sure tried their best.  Servers even brought milk for some to wash down the chocolatey goodness. **End edit**  The bar has a good selection, my midori sour that was a size of a water glass was probably around $8, but if you think about half that size at a club going at $6, the hotel's price was pretty decent.  Plus it was made very tasty.  Then there was the  Ho, fo sho  that tried to strike up convos with the males in our group.  Valley girl drawl and fur coat.  As slick as she can be, she leans over to one of the guys and says....  ...wait for it...  ...."What's your sign?"  Where did you learn that line, Prostitution 101?  I think I have a better selection of pickup lines in my brain, yikes!  This was in no way part of my rating of the hotel, however.  What a night!  I got a really good laugh, that's fo sho.

Why two stars?  In my opinion, if my roast chicken is dryer than my skin after I spent a day in the hot Arizona sun without any lotion, and you're asking me to pay $16 for that and 8 small slices of potato and 20 slivers of overcooked carrot, it's not a successful meal.  I know most everyone has rated this place pretty high - and I really hate to give a non-chain restaurant a bad review, but the 'Meh. I've experienced better' for 2 stars is exactly how I felt.  On the positive side, our waitress was very attentive and I did not feel ignored.  Our glasses never went empty, and while I did not imbibe, it seems they have a well stocked bar and some pretty tasty sounding albeit pricey drinks.  And therein lies the crux of my discontent.  I've been to many chic restaurants in many different locations.  Call me crazy, but it doesn't concern me the amount of money I spend on a meal, if I feel I got my money's worth.  And I don't feel I got my money's worth.  The $4 bruschetta was a delicious concoction of goat cheese/pesto spread topped with a 3/4 inch piece of heirloom tomato, a chiffonade of basil, and a drizzling of balsamic reduction.  The problem?  There were two 2 inch pieces.  The end.  Although I already cried my woes over the roasted chicken entree, I did not mention that it was neither herby nor garlicky as advertized, and the plating design left something to be desired.  I was surprised that there was not a hint of green anywhere on the plate to balance the colors, and it looked sadly bare.  Also for being roasted, the chicken skin lacked the crunch I so needed and the potatoes were quite soggy.  The $5 chocolate pot de creme was a smooth chocolate custard made with Vahlrona chocolate.  The problem?  It is described as a rich, chocolatey dessert.  While it was not horrible (we did finish it, after all...), I've had a lot better and a larger portion for the same price elsewhere.  It did not give the Vahlrona chocolate the respect it deserves.  The $5 creme brulee was smooth, but did not have the glassy crackle a good brulee should have.   I was hoping it would have been better than the one I make.  Sorry Vogue, but it was not an answer to my prayers as you so purport.  In the end, I am still seeking the four star experience that others seem to have had, so I may be trying out the lunch...but if the quality of the food is still lacking, I will unfortunately have to cross this one off my list.  So 'creme brulee afficionados', save your $5.  I will give you a recipe for creme brulee that will taste exactly the same and for the same amount of money, you will have a fridge full of custardy goodness.  Chicken lovers, try the steak.  Maybe you'll have a better experience.  And above all, O Vogue, hear my prayers.  I want to rate you better, but I need better from you.

Who needs crunchy, fresh popcorn when you can come here for stale, rubbery and tasteless at premium prices?  I was so excited to have a movie theater arrive on my side of town.  Previously, I had a choice to go either to Arrowhead (30 minutes away on an average day) or Tolleson (30 minutes on an average day) so imagine my glee at reading about this place in the papers.  So how can a theater get two stars?  1.  Aforementioned popcorn 2.  More expensive tickets ("because of the price of gas" says the manager even though Harkins is still cheaper) 3.  More expensive snacks and drinks 4.  Incredibly loud slide projector with 5 different slides on it 5.  Sound lacking in quality to Harkins 6.  Employees that seem a little lost themselves 7.  Matinees go until 4pm unlike Harkins' 6pm 8.  Lack of inventory (for a new theater?)  Even the employees  were miffed about the fact that they were out of caramel popcorn a week past opening.  I would rather drive the extra minutes to get always fresh (free with my t-shirt) popcorn and $1 (with my nifty cup) drink from Harkins.  My neighbor has gone at least twice to the theater and says she herself has had to deal with stale popcorn on both occasions.  Needless to say I really was not impressed with our theater and am one Surprise-ian still begging for a Harkins or a likeness thereof.  Forgive me O Harkins for any negative thoughts I harbored for you before.

As far as the pizza, I've only had the thin crust here.  If you've ever had Quonset pizza in Waukeegan Illinois, you'd know the fan base they have there.  Little Sicily is probably the closest to Quonset in Arizona I've ever had.  I never was a fan of thin crust pizza before...it reminded me of eating hot sauce and meat on a cracker...but ever since I had Quonset and now Little Sicily, I'm starting to see the error of my ways.  I still appreciate a good fluffy crust, however, and this place has both.  Last night I decided to try the Chicken parmigiana.  Unfortunately, the server told us that the order had been put in as Veal.  I'm sure the veal is quite tasty, but I just can't bring myself to digesting it, not to mention it was more expensive than the chicken.  When the issue was brought up to the young girls who had taken the order, they began arguing about it saying they knew I ordered veal.  I think I know what I order, especially since I don't eat veal.  Meanwhile the chef listened to the girl bitch about the order with half an ear and winked at us grinning.  The CHICKEN parmigiana, by the way, was extremely tasty with al dente angel hair pasta, fresh cheese melted under the broiler, a slightly sweet and tangy sauce, and perfectly cooked chicken.  *The restaurant has since lost a star because the same girl blanked when we asked for cheese and pepper flakes.  DUH!  It also seems to be a Bring Your Own Wine kind of place.  They have the glasses, but you supply the liquids.

This place totally makes up for the other pizza place that unfortunately shares the same name as this place, but has absolutely no affiliation (thank goodness).  First off, I have to say that the two times I've been here, I haven't once paid for the actual pizza, because if you sign up your birthday, you're given a coupon by e-mail for a FREE PIZZA.  Extra toppings are extra charge, of course.  So  if you haven't tried this place yet and don't know whether you should spend your money, sign up to get a coupon on your birthday.  I'll definitely spend my money for a pizza even without a coupon.  The crust is thin and crispy, with just enough chew to it so it doesn't taste like a cracker with toppings.  The coal firing gives a wonderfully smokey flavor to the pizza, and leaves yummy bubbles in the crust.  So far we've done half pepperoni and half meatball.  Meatball you say?  I admit I've never had meatball on a pizza, so I couldn't help but picture golfball sized meatballs atop a thin slice harnessed in place with strings of mozzarella.  I know, I know..they Slice the meatballs, silly.  I'm normally not a big fan of pepperoni, but this stuff was surprizingly meaty, slightly spicey, and not too oily.  The meatballs though...the meatballs are my favorite.    Top everything off with great service (people that actually know their stuff), a fully stocked bar (with beer sporting the name of "the Kilt Lifter"), and nice cozy atmosphere.  I have been back, and I will be back.

The restaurant name sounds like a translation gone bad...and while this place had been up for some time and extremely close to my work, I didn't make the short trip simply because of a fear that I would find spaghetti in place of chow mein, and watered down leftover eggs in place of egg drop soup.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I found that this place has an impressive menu that specializes in Vietnamese cuisine, and also keeps around some more generic Chinese, Korean, and Thai dishes for the faint of heart.  But you can't go to a Vietnamese restaurant and not try the noodle dishes.  The beef stew brought back some wonderful memories.  The noodles were tender, beef was melt in my  mouth, and seasonings were just right.  Pair the soup with some fresh basil and it's all good.  Spring rolls were fresh and tasty dipped in my favorite - peanut sauce.  I only wish there were some fresh peanuts sprinkled in for some added crunch.  What really added that extra star though, was the number of drinks and desserts on the menu.  Who can turn down Thai tea with pearls? And Vietnamese dessert cups with pomegranate and coconut mixed with sweet milk and shaved ice?  2 Die 4!!  Prices are very reasonable and staff is very friendly.  This is definitely due for a return visit!

My first thought:  What a strange mix of a menu!  There's butterburgers (what they're famous for), fried chicken, fish, tuna melts, cheesesteaks, salads....and then their other claim to fame, the frozen custard.  I tried the mushroom swiss burger which was very juicy, and the meat had an interesting texture - moist on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside.  The bun was very buttery.  I tried a little of the chili cheese fries, which were pretty tasty and generous...and also tried some of the cheese curds.  I liked the seasoning on the curds and liked that they used two different cheeses.  They were a ton better than those at A&W in my opinion.  Just a warning though, the burgers are so big and filling, there's not a lot of room left in the tummy for sides.  I was SO full.  The custard is smooth and silky, and I'm afraid to say Culver's may give Ritters a bit of competition.    You can get a quart for $5.99.  Every other quart you buy after that first one only costs you $3 each.  The price is extremely reasonable.  I was interested in the fact that you can get what they call regular sides and premium sides.  Anything from regular fries to sauteed green beans.  I don't think I ever had green beans with a hamburger...  Prices are pretty decent, and the staff seems very friendly and motivated.  I didn't see one person just sitting idly.  We'll see if this place stands the test of time, I hope the best for them.  So far I'm liking this place far better than the M or the box, especially in terms of service.

It may not have a very creative name, but the food is great!  I used to go a lot more but can only go there now if I'm in the area, which is rare.  Located next to Club CBNC, It's a small little place with red velvet booths, and you get the idea that the staff are either all family or close friends.  They're extremely friendly and orders come to the table quickly.  Prices are good for the portions.  I can usually share one plate with another person and still have a bit left over.  You can do a traditional Korean BBQ or just order prepared dishes.  I haven't done the BBQ yet, but I have tried various dishes on the menu and they were all yummy.  My recommendation is the Beef Chop Chae, which is a translucent noodle, slices of beef, scallions, broccoli, carrots, onions, and the traditional Korean sauce.  It is served with a bowl of rice and between 6 to 10 different accompanyments in small bowls ranging from kimchi to a sweet sauteed potato (my favorite...I still haven't figured out what the sauce is).  The items in the small bowls differ depending on what they have on hand.  In the words of Homer Simpson, "guh-gluglugluhhh"

Good trip at least once  Tortilla Flat was a stop for gold miners and a post office for people around the area.  It has a population of 6.  Yes, it's small.  It has a cute little history written on the walls.  The best thing about this little stop is the saloon and general store.  I haven't tried any of the food in the saloon, but it's kind of neat to go in and look around.  The general store's little gem are the flavors of hand made ice cream.    Mmmm...prickly pear ice cream.  Don't go to Tortilla Flat expecting a grand Disneyland feel, it's just a little surprising outcropping in the Superstition Mountains.  But if you're in the area and passing through, you HAVE to make a stop and try the ice cream at least.  Plus you get a little Arizona history in the system.

You know you're in a great place when it's located in the middle of retirementville and it's still hoppin' after 11pm.  And I'm not the youngest one there.  This place is one chic little bistro that is family owned.  The owners are the sweetest people ever, and they were more than accommodating for our party of 7.  The atmosphere of the entire place is one of joy and good humor, and mingles smoothly between contemporary and rat pack era.  And I don't mean the kind of rat pack era that makes me feel like I'm still a fetus.  Ever been to a restaurant you didn't want to leave?  This is one of those places.  But what's atmosphere without good food?  Dominic's doesn't disappoint.  The menu is pretty simple, but everything looks delicious!  I had the chicken parm, which was a perfectly cooked moist piece of buck-buck I've ever had.  The marinara is perfectly herbed.  Most everyone else had the eggplant parm, which I tried a bit of, and found a new love.  I already know what my next meal there is going to be!  I also recommend the house dressing on the salad - it tastes almost like a tomato viniagrette.  The fried ravioli were also drool-worthy.  Okay so now I have to start a new paragraph just for the dessert, which was the Cassata Cake, hand made by the daughter.  The first thing you think of is, 'this is my future wedding cake'.  It was moist, and had just the perfect sweetness in the frosting without being too cloyingly sweet.  And as if it needed any improvements, the occasional chocolate chip that wandered into my mouth made it just that much better.  The house band was excellent all night, and if you feel like the cake is expanding your waistline, just hop up onto the dance floor and shake your money makers.  Every 15 minutes of dancing allows you to eat another slice of Cassata Cake.  No Lie!  This place is large party friendly, good for all ages, and only parties into the night on Fridays and Saturdays.  Get there early, or miss out on seating!

This place must have been called Cigarillos at one point...but the owner calls it Cigar Inn.  A husband and wife (Salma) run the store, and wonderfully at that.  Salma was just fabulous with her accent and upbeat attitude.  Once she found out I was an artist, she showed me the multitudes of beautiful cigar boxes (some of them are extremely rare...and just gorgeous!) and let me tour the huge humidor.  I'm no afficionado in the least, but it was pretty impressive.  There was a nice little smoking lounge that looked so comfy I was almost regretful that I didn't smoke.    Salma also tempted me pretty successfully into purchasing some beautiful and delightfully smelling diffusers.  She and her husband are just great, and I can't wait to visit again!

I actually found Lychee liquor there!  Need I say more?  You would think with a place that looked like that, prices would be a little much....but they were reasonable if not on the lower end for some.  Rare and intriguing wine and spirits, knowledgeable staff.  I didn't try any of their foods, but I wouldn't mind going again.  One of the staff recommended a nice moscato.  I took it home and enjoyed a glass immediately.  How did he know?  Wow.

I love restaurants that make you feel like you've watched a little too much of the Food Network...  The biggest benefit was the fact that there is a portion of your menu where you can choose one of their specialty sauces and pair it with your favorite pasta.  So I rooted through my memory of Alton Brown's 'Good Eats' shows trying to remember the uses of each type of pasta...and then remembered I'm not a pasta afficionado.  Prices are a tiny bit higher than say Olive Garden, but if given a choice between the two, I'd come back to La Bona Pasta.  Why?  Beccause they are   F R E S H  The kitchen is wide open for you so it's not like they could drop a piece of chicken on the floor, or pick an orfice on their body and return to preparing your food.  They do everything right there!  Oh, and if one was worried about the fact that the prices are a couple of dollars more than a chain restaurant, one would only have to click on the following link:   http://couponclipper.com/loc/LA-BONA-PASTA   Which offers a 'buy one, get one half off' on lunch or dinner.  Fabulous!  I couldn't print it so I showed the coupon from my phone and they didn't hesitate to take it!  I would recommend printing it though, I think it might be easier for them.  It's good until next month but I'll bet they issue out another one when that one's done and you can be sure I'll use it!  Now Foodward!  My friend ordered the Carbonara with fettucini, and I got the Sauce a La Bona Pasta with angel hair.  We each tried the other's dish.  While the Carbonara was well executed (what could you possibly have a complaint about a lovely creamy sauce and PANCETTA??), we both agreed that we liked the signature sauce even better.  The Sauce a La Bona -or whatever it was called; who cares about the name it was Yummy!- included a creamy marinara sauce with bits of moist chicken, broccoli, and porcini mushrooms.  It was perfect with the angel hair but I could see it with fusili or farfalle as well.  We finished off the night with the tiramisu, which was definitely homemade and definitely one of the best I've had.  I didn't like the sauces they put on the plate...I know they did it for decor purposes, but I would have rather had a light dusting of cocoa on the plate, a little whipped cream, with a sprig of mint.  It would have complemented the cake much better.    So to sum up this experience, I was more than happy about my meal and am extremely jealous I don't have a place like this closer to my house.  So La Bona Pasta, if Litchfield Park's rent is a little too much for you, we would be more than happy to have you move North!!

I haven't been to Marley's in a long time...since the era of the peach cornbread...which disappointingly no longer exists because, as our waiter put it, "they need to save the peaches for the peach cobbler".  I didn't realize canned peaches were nearly extinct!  People, heed my call...covet your canned peaches now before it is too late!!  My next warning:  Don't order anything fried because it is all the same frozen stuff you can get in the supermarket for much less and without having to tip someone.  I almost ordered the Chicken Fried Steak until I found out it was a frozen piece of breaded ground beef.  Maybe Marley's Restaurant & Bar should be renamed to Marley's Frozen Foods.  What did Marley's do well?  They were extremely "successful in avoiding flavor", as one of my co-diners remarked.  She had the baby back ribs with corn and mushroom orzo, my other co-diner had the 5 oz. sirloin with orzo and a baked potato that was the size of an egg, and I had the meatloaf with clam chowder and orzo.  Oh boy where to begin?  Yep I just started.  The orzo used to be risotto on the old menu...but I guess risotto takes more skill and finesse to do successfully and orzo can be simply made in advance and reheated in the microwave, which is what our orzo tasted like.  Sans any flavor of any sort.  I actually had to...*wipes a tear* add salt to it, which is usually a no-no in my book.  The 5 oz. steak that was requested to be cooked to medium was cut into the shape of a laughing cow cheese wedge.  Except I wasn't laughing.  And it wasn't cheese.  Neither was it cooked to medium; it was more in the raw mooing stage.  It was also more like 4 oz.  Maybe they had to reserve the other 1 oz. for their peach cobbler.  My clam chowder would have made a Bostonian embarrassed.  It was made with good ole corn starch and had little to no cream.  No smoky goodness from bacon either.  How could you forsake BACON??  My meatloaf was a brick.  Literally.  It was packed densely and devoid of any moisture and had a brown gravy on it.  If I hadn't put a little ketchup on it, I don't think I would've tasted a thing from it.  I'm embarrassed that I suggested the restaurant to my co-diners and have had night sweats about my decision ever since.  Marley's used to be palatable and the peach cornbread was really what made me want to try it again...but now that it's gone for good, I guess I'll have to save my dining experience for one of the better restaurants in Surprise.  Feel free to try it out if you'd like.  As for me, unless Marley's makes some serious changes and puts some more thought and care into what they're serving, I'm taking my can of peaches and going home!

The last time I'd gone to one of these was when I was in college...so I was a little curious to see how it was now.  I ordered a patty melt and onion rings.  My other party member tried the cheeseburger, fries, and strawberry shake.  The patty melt was greasy...but not more than you'd get other places.  It was decent, a little large.  I could only eat half.  I'd rather they had put American cheese instead of Cheddar... The fries weren't very tasty either, and they forgot the cheese in the cheeseburger (uh...main ingredient.)...  So why four stars?  The onion rings were scrumptious!  Crunchy and great flavor...and it came piping hot.  The shakes are so insanely creamy good.  The service was really good too.  When the waitress was told we were in a rush to go see a movie, she hustled.  The staff picks a song at random and starts to dance in the middle of the dining area....pretty amusing.  It beats the loud off tone happy birthday singing, for sure!  The specialties are the shakes and malts.  Lots of flavors to choose from, and the only one that I'd have reservations about trying would be the apple pie shake.  Something about it just sounds....wrong.  I'm picturing slurping a piece of pie into my mouth?  Ew.  It just a generally upbeat typical chain 50's type diner.  It probably helped that there weren't too many customers in the place.  Just thinking about it makes me want a milkshake.

I'm a girl and even I was taken aback by the female staff wearing the little schoolgirl skirts.  Ok guys, don't all rush in all at once!  I'm a little biased, living in Surprise but I've also been to a LOT of sushi restaurants in Arizona and I've been to all three that exist in this city.  By FAR Uni is better than the other two.  It's a bit more expensive on some rolls than some places, but the service is great, the size of the rolls are standard to larger, and I always leave full and happy.  I'm sure sushi lovers understand that sometimes price can also be affected by quality of fish or the size of the roll.  For two of us, we ate for $30.  We probably could have done a little less but couldn't resist an extra order of unagi!  Some tips for the best value if you come by:  1.  They just extended their Happy Hour.  It's now 3pm until close. 2.  If you sit at the sushi bar, you get a couple of freebies in the form of a deliciously refreshing cucumber salad, and miso soup. 3.  Lunch is $12 and includes miso soup, salad, one of three sushi rolls, a small shrimp tempura platter, and a large bowl of udon noodles.  This meal lasted me three days total!  If you have to prioritize what to eat and what to keep, the udon noodles taste great reheated.  Tempura and sushi rolls....not so much - so eat those first!  For $15 you can pick more premium rolls.  I've been coming in to dine at Uni for awhile now and have had the pleasure of seeing the fan base grow.  The owner is very community oriented and is open to suggestions.  I don't want this place to go away, so help us Surprisians keep this place around!  Some of my favorite rolls -   The Red Bull Roll Poke Roll Lollipop Roll  And we can't forget the UNAGI!  So to sum up - I didn't put 5 stars to it because I can't honestly say it's the best sushi I've ever had.  But I have never had a bad meal or experience, and it is my favorite in Surprise.  I'm definitely a fan!

You thought you knew citrus....until you go to Truman Ranch II.    Jump in your car and head to Surprise.  Hit Greenway Road (about a mile south of Bell Rd) and drive all the way west and look for the signs that say "U-Pick Citrus".  You will come to a former U of A Citrus Agricultural Research Center managed by Mr. Truman and his lovely wife.    For $10, you get a 15 lb bag and for $20, a 40lb bag.  Mix and match from any of the over 85 varieties of citrus fruits.  There are all sorts of lemons, grapefruits, oranges, mandarin oranges, pummelo, and more!  Mr. Truman is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to citrus.  He will advise visitors on which fruits are the sweetest at the time of your visit, let you taste the different varieties that are the most ripe, and educate you on the different types you will find on your walkabout.  Some tips before you go:  --------------------------------------------------------------- *the season begins somewhere around December through April (check his FB page) *they only open Saturday and Sunday from 9:30am to 3:00pm *they take cash or check - no cards *take LOTS of water with you.  There's a lot of walking.  And you're in the desert....duh. *take a small folding knife with you - you'll want to try a fruit before you start picking fiftykagillion of them just to go home and find out you picked the ones Mr. Truman told you weren't any good. *bring a washcloth.  Those suckers can be pretty juicy!  You don't want to be wandering around with juice slathering down your chin and neck and lure thirsty critters to your face. *wear comfy shoes - no thong sandals.  Wear what you would wear hiking.  You'll be more comfortable. *bring your kids - they should see that fruit doesn't grow in grocery stores, and most of the citrus you see there you won't ever see in a store. *the 40 lb bag is the best deal for the $ *have fun and share!  40 lbs of fruit is a lot and if you're worried that it will spoil before you get through it all, remember you can juice it, or share it with your friends and neighbors.  My dog would gladly share some with you. ----------------------------------------------------------------- We all need to help support our local farms and businesses.  There is no other place like this one.  I guarantee you will be glad you went.
