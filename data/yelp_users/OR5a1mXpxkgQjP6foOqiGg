First visit to the salon and met with Oliver for a haircut. He did a great job, very professional. My search is over now !

Dont ever Fly US Airways to Hawaii. The Flight Attendants were rude and very unpleasant. Spend the Extra and Fly Hawaiian Airline.

After 6 weeks of a broken AC unit in the gym I again asked DJ the club manager why it has not been repaired and it should not be taking this long. I was yelled at by DJ and told repairs will be done with they get done and if I don't like it to find another gym to workout at. I have never been yelled at by a manager as a paying customer when I question anything. His job as a manager is to field questions and concerns of his paying customers without losing his temper. Apparently customer service is not his forte.
