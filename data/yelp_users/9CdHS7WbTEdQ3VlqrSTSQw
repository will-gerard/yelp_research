It's the best Chinese food in the Valley. My family and I have been coming here for years and my boyfriend and I drove out here from east mesa so he could try it for the first time and he loved it! If you're anywhere near by, or not! you have to at least give this place a try. The wait staff was a little difficult to communicate with, but other than that, I really enjoy the food here!

I feel it's a little generous to give even two stars (it's cute and clean inside, I'll give it that). I booked a bachelorette party for my bride-to-be sister and 7 other girls on a Saturday morning. When arranging everything, I was given the impression from phone discussions, emails, and their web site that as we had a large party, we would be the only ones in the salon (it says on their web site a minimum of 6 required to close salon to other guests, we were 8). It's why I assumed we paid a premium for our manicures and pedicures. We were asked to pay the "party" prices of $65 plus tax and mandatory 20% tip per person for a simple mani/pedi package. It's the same package as their $49 combo pack. But I thought, ok it'll just be us and we can bring food and hang out for a bit and it'll be fun! Nope. Not so much. When we arrived with food we were looked at like crazy people and one of the techs said, "I guess I could clean off this counter back here." They did not close the salon down, which would have been fine, except we PAID a PREMIUM for this specific service (or so I thought). Please, ladies, reconsider scheduling a party here. Or just get everyone in your group to make an advanced reservation for the $49 mani/pedi service and save yourself some $$$.

First of all, I love blow dry bars. I have really long hair so to me it's such a relief when someone else can do my hair the way I want it. But this place really missed the mark. There were 4 of us going for our friend's birthday and we chose Primp and Blow (over the other blow dry bar in scottsdale) because they do makeup too and we wanted the complete package. On their web site, it tells you that a blow out and makeup takes an hour. Well this seemed a little strange to me because they tell you that just a blow dry takes 45 minutes. This doesn't leave a lot of give room if someone's hair is long, or they want hot tools such as a curling iron, etc (WHICH COST AN EXTRA $10!!!!! absurd).   So I'll just list the downsides: the place was dirty, there was hair on the floor everywhere, the front desk lady was probably one of the rudest service people I've ever met, followed closely by the lady who did my hair and makeup (she rushed the whole thing and when I tried pleasant conversation, she gave me an extremely rude answer implying that I was late and was now going to push all her clients back. I was not late. It is not my problem that they only book 1 hour for hair and makeup); they only have 2 chairs for makeup so if more than 2 people are getting that done then we have to sit in a low circular couch thing meant as a waiting area; the blow dryers hanging from the ceiling are a nice touch except the one on the end wasn't staying up and kept hitting the client in the head; the surprise $10 for the hairdresser touching a curling iron (which she neglected to inform me about and just did it even when I said she could just curl my hair with a round brush and dryer); the makeup done was rushed and horrible, I had to keep asking her to add stuff because it seemed like she just wanted to finish and get me out of there.   Needless to say I will NOT be back. There is a far better drybar place not far from this one that was so so so much better. I can go elsewhere for makeup.

A friend of mine is in a wedding soon where the bridal party is having their hair done at Drybar. She has very VERY curly hair so she wanted to see what it would be like to have them blow out and straighten her hair (it tends to get very frizzy). I decided to go along for the ride as I have very long hair and am often way too lazy/short on time to ever style it myself. We had appointments and were taken back right on time. It was early in the day, but still a Friday so I expected it to be busy. It did say on the web site that each appointment is approximately 1/2 hr long. But with my massive amounts of hair, and her massive amounts of curls it took us both an hour. We didn't have any place to be which was good, but just keep in mind that your appointment may go longer than stated on the web site.   But I have to say that Liz did my hair PERFECTLY. Exactly the way I would do it if I wanted to do it myself. I'm glad I live 30 minutes away or I would be there waaay too often. And my friend came out with perfectly straight hair, just what she wanted. The price to me was great, and explaining to my boyfriend why I paid $45 (after tip) for someone to "just stand there with a blow drier" (as he put it; she did FAR more than that) is the same as explaining why I indulge on the occasional mani/pedi (which turns out to be around the same price). Sure I can paint my nails myself, but why deprive myself of the indulgence?
