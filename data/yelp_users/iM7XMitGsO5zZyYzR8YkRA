Horrible customer service displayed by Vanna the shift manager. I came here on Thursday and arrived shortly before 7am.  No one was up front when I entered, so I stood there awkwardly for about 3 minutes before Vanna came to take my order.  No smile, no greeting, just "know what you want".  I placed my order and moved to the register.    Vanna came to the register a few minutes after making mine, and another patrons bagels (and running to the back about half a dozen times).  She shoved the bagel in my hand and mumbled something about needing to get her till.  So I'm standing there with the bagel, my credit card, again waiting on her.    Customer service was awful. A million things could've happened that morning to create a hectic start to the day, but the customer shouldn't know it.  A shift manager should be friendly, inviting, and quick, or at least apologize if there are obvious issues.  Too bad she didn't get the memo.

I revisited this location recently as a comp from the manager and, it was a wonderful experience.  The (assuming newer) manager runs a tight ship at this location, and it shows.  Patrons were much more well behaved than last time and the service was more friendly than I remember as well.  I LOVE Mongolian food but unfortunately any time I crave it I have to treck from the West side of town to the land of great Mongolian restaurants, which is the East Valley.    Normally, I go to the location on the 101 and Indian Bend, but my fianc√© and I decided that we liked this location much better after our visit as it has a more laid back calmer atmosphere.  Everything was clean and organized.  I avoided the fish altogether this time, and opted for steak/chicken.  The veggie variety was amazing and they have sriracha available as well.  Sriracha is my new found LOVE, and any place that offers it, is A-OK with me.  All in all, I will definitely return, and thank the manager for making me a believer and a HUGE fan of this location of YC's Mongolian Grill.

One of my favorite dive bars!  Pool, darts, shuffle board etc.  Great juke box!  Bar food is really good actually.  Everyone is very friendly as well!

Wow. There is a neon sign on the window that reads "Best Thai Food in Town". LIARS! It was literally the most putrid thing I've ever eaten in my life.   I walked in and was hit in the face by this really odd stench. A cross between urine, a gym, and rotting chicken would be the best way to describe it. I should've turned around and walked right out. However, some "ethnic" restaurants have an odd smell to them so I decided to forge ahead, past the HUGE fish tank with 3 fish, kids laying on the floor, and tables that look like they haven't been cleaned in a month. There were awards everywhere raving about the cuisine there. Well, I don't know what was wrong with the people presenting these awards because they obviously have no taste buds.   Since I ordered my chicken green curry to go ahead of time, I didn't have to wait long (thank baby Jesus). I got home and discovered that the GREEN curry, was somehow red not green (even though it was in fact green curry). Not only that, but there was hardly any vegetables or chicken in it. In fact, it was more liquid than anything.  Just plain 'ol terrible, at best!  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy...

Went here Friday night for some yummy Indian food, and it was okay.  We ordered 3 dishes for 3 people and 2 orders of the garlic naan bread.  I thought it was fairly overpriced for what we got.  We paid $53 for everything, and they only gave us 1 order of the naan bread.  I remember this place being a lot better than it was.  I have never dined in, but I don't think I would want to.  It had an odd smell, and the tables were pretty dirty for being "clean".

Hands down, this is my favorite sushi spot.  I used to be an avid Ah-So visitor...USED to be.  I now know what amazing sushi tastes like thanks to Fresh Wasabi.  Each roll I've tried is delicious and filling.  If you go during happy hour, you can easily fill 2 bellies for $20-$30.  Try the spicy crab roll...you will not regret it.

I would not recommend this office to anyone.  I was told by my insurance company that this was a covered physician so I became a patient.  After a few visits I always had a balance which never questioned.  I wised up and contacted my insurance company and asked why I owed money on a supposed 100% covered service.  I always went for very basic services (routine cleanings).  I was told that this dentist charges more than what insurance pays, which is why I had a balance.  I called Dr Browns office and asked why they charged more.  They stated that my insurance company had not been a contracted insurance.  Are you kidding?  Why would they NOT bring this up when I first scheduled my appointment?  Penny is bad at her job and is very deceiving.  I would not recommend this practice.   I have since changed dental offices and I never owe anything.  This office and their staff practice poor billing services and my account is now in collections.  They will never see a dime based on principle, and I suggest you find a new dentist, as I did.

How does this NOT have a solid 5 stars?  Maybe because I have a certain love for little hole in the wall bars and awesome beer that others do not.  Came here for a second date, and it was a great night.  We didn't eat, although everything looked really yummy.  The beer selection couldn't be beat, and the prices were just right.  Awesome juke box and many televisions to watch whatever sporting event that might happen to be on.  The atmosphere is great and the staff are very attentive without being overbearing.    I will definitely be frequenting this wonderful place!

I liked this place and would've liked to try more than just pierogies. I did order kielbasa as well, but it didn't come out, and she didn't charge me for it, so I didn't argue. This is a really cute restaurant, with great patio seating.   I hand make my own pierogies (which I am not entirely bias to, I always am on the lookout for someone who can do them better). A Touch of European Cafe's are about a 6. I think they were a touch undercooked and a bit too greasy for my liking. The farmers cheese that they use in their potato is wonderful, and I think I will be trying that out the next time I make mine. Their sauerkraut were good, but lacked depth.   Overall, I think that this is a great place to come to, and probably doesn't have much competition as this is the only Polish restaurant that I know of.

Oh Mercers how I love thee.    This is my family's go to spot when I don't want to cook.  I have tried several items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  My new favorite is the prime rib.  It's so juicy and delicious.  The portions are huge and the price is more than fair.  We come here at least every other week, and it just feels like grandma's house (but with better cooking).  :)  Decor isn't anything special, but it's clean.  The staff are always friendly and service is quick.

After finding out my favorite Thai restaurant is closed Monday's, I desperately search yelp mobile for the closest Thai restaurant. This one wasn't too far of a drive so I excitedly drive over to 35th Avenue and Bell. I find Touch of Thai in a less than nice strip mall, but I know better than to judge a book by it's cover.   I walk in, and am greeted not only by the hostess, but a smell. Not a "oh my, the food smells DELISH", but a "what the hell is that?" kinda smell. This is the night that I finally figured out that NO THAI RESTAURANT should ever SMELL. Any of the ones that I've ever given terrible reviews for have had a stench!   The menu is weird to say the least.  It's like I'm in a thai restaurant but am looking at a chinese menu.    The service was mediocre, and the food was less than average. I ordered my green curry a 10 on the spicy scale, and my sister ordered her spicy noodle at a 5. They screwed up and gave her the 10 and me the 5. Boy was a jealous as she was sitting across from me sweating and blowing her nose, while I add chili powder, Thai chilli's and red peppers to get that wonderful burn! No such luck...no 10, and I kinda ruined the flavor. DARN! If only they would've listened.   The green curry wasn't the best I've had.  Not a variety of vegetables that I love and get from Siam Thai.  The waitress checked on us maybe 3 times the entire meal, and she took 10 minutes to bring our check.   "People on YELP love us" says the sticker on their door...well I'm a people and I don't love you.

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE these burgers!  When I am craving a good burger, I come here!  The ranch burger is my "go to" order.  Top it off with an order of their fries, and I'm set!

When I walked in....I was like "WTF". There were bags on the wall and some red sharpie markers on a counter. It took me a minute to figure it out (I'm about a green in the box of crayons...not bright like yellow, but not dark like midnight blue). Any who, the sandwiches all looked great, and I decided on the Club. It was a different kind of club than you would find at say Subway, since it had ham, turkey, and bacon, instead of roast beef.   On said bag, you mark which ingredients you would like, hand it to the cashier and wait. It wasn't terribly busy, so the wait time was about 5.5 minutes. When I got back to the shop (I was eating with a friend @ her hair salon...great place BTW), I was pleasantly surprised. The bacon wasn't that crap microwave stuff, and it was just delectable. The sub was perfect...not too big, not too small, juuuuusssst right! They do toast it, and I'm not a big fan of toasted subs, but it was about a 2.5 on the toasted scale, and that made me happy!   I would definitely come here again, as the subs were great, the speed of service was great, EVERYTHING was great!

I really LOVE Mongolian restaurants. You really can't get pissed off at anyone but yourself if your meal sucks! I love how clean the restaurant is, and how friendly the staff are! They have a great vegetable selection and a good meat selection as well.   Aside from the Mongolian/stir fry part, they also offer rice, soup, and other miscellaneous items to enjoy as well. I haven't found a Mongolian restaurant that I have liked as much as this one, and trust me, I've looked!   I do wish they offered shrimp and calamari, and maybe some baby corn, but really, that's just my personal taste.   I think they should offer a menu of sauces for those first timers who have NO clue what they are doing, but as for me, I've got my recipe DOWN!

Wow, the 1 star below really surprises me!  Are you sure this was Molly and her husband selling these?  If it wasn't, why wouldn't you have called the store...I'm sure they would've been glad to exchange the order to make things right, because that is the kind of people they are.  Molly and her husband are two of the most wonderful people that you could ever have the pleasure of knowing.  They are family oriented and kind...not to mention, wonderful cooks!    Molly prides herself in making her tamales with the best produce and meat cuts, with NO lard.  I haven't come across a tamale of hers that I haven't liked.  They are a bit "pricy" but goes the saying "you get what you pay for".    If you want the best tamales in town (and possibly the best tamales you'll ever try) head on down to their store on 43rd and Olive, or try catching them at one of the local farmers markets, you will not be disappointed.

I LOVE FunuGyz!  It's one of my favorite bars in the area!  Food is great, and they play awesome music!  During the week, they usually have classic rock going, which makes my heart super happy.  As far as the food goes, it's fairly decent for "bar food".  I love that they mail 1 cent coupons for beer!  Keep 'em comin!

I have never had their pizza, just their calzones. The spinach calzone is sooo yummy! When we order, we usually get a spinach calzone, and an eggplant calzone (but we've also gotten the chicken Parmesan as well). I don't think I've ever been disappointed in coming here. The prices are so reasonable too! I've talked to Nick and his wife, and they are just amazing people.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great meal at home for a very reasonable price!

I have since gone back 3 times for the green curry.  I'm pretty sure it's laced with cocaine to keep me coming back for more.  The spice is perfect (if you love the burn) and the staff is more than friendly.    From the outside you wouldn't think to even walk in as it's pretty close to the ghetto, but upon stepping in, you will be saying, you are not in Kansas anymore.  It's a very pretty restaurant on the inside.  The wooden screens on the wall are gorgeous and the tables are wood with runners down the center to create a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.    Siam Thai has become my favorite Thai restaurant hands down.  I cannot wait to take my friends and family here!

Very nice atmosphere and decor.  All tables and no booths, in case you were wondering, and in case you are a "booth" person.  We sat right in front of the cash register, and the downside to that was people picking up take out orders kept bumping my chair, but it wasn't a make it or break it event.    The staff was very pleasant and my drink didn't sit empty for more than 2 minutes, TOPS.  (That is a BIG deal for me, especially with spicy Thai food)  I ordered green curry at a 10 (level of spice) and it was just right!!!  The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and it had a smooth texture.  The portions were very large as well.  Enough for lunch the next day for sure.  We also ordered spring rolls, and they were delicious.  Had a sweet taste to them, but were fresh and crisp.    I would come here again for sure.  They're green curry (on a scale of 1-10) is about an 8.5 or a 9.

I'm addicted. I come here often and the food is always delicious and is consistent.  The service is always friendly and I will tell you, this is the CLEANEST restaurant I've ever been in.  They take pride in this place and it shows in the freshness and quality of the food and the cleanliness of the entire restaurant.  We usually get the teriyaki bowls, with egg rolls, but we've also had the lemon chicken and BBQ chicken and it's all so delicious!!

Arizona is one of the few states that does Mexican food right. This place apparently did not get the memo. The experience wasn't all bad. The margarita's were good, and the chips were good as well. That's about as good as it got. The salsa was flavorful, but lacked any sort of spice. I did get a side of "hot sauce" but it tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chili seasoning (not spicy at all).   I ordered the mini chimi's, chili con queso, and a cup of tortilla soup for my daughter and I to split.   The tortilla soup was terrible! It lacked any sort of flavor, and had more tortilla strips and cheese than anything. Very few vegetables (no avocado?!?), and hardly any chicken. I've had better soup from a can to be perfectly honest.   The chili con queso dip was average, but nothing special. Pretty sure it was the Velveeta with Rotel chili recipe.   The mini chimi's were greasy! Upon taking my first bite, grease literally came out the other side and ran down my hand.  GROSS!  The service was decent, but not memorable.   All in all, I wouldn't recommend Popo's to anyone who had high expectations for their Mexican craving.

I purchased a buywithme.com coupon to get my first ever shellac polish.  Glenda (the technician) is located in the Salon Boutique in suite #32.  When you walk in, you think your inside a mini mall, as each suite is set up as an individual work station for hair stylists, nail technicians, etc.    Upon meeting Glenda, I was offered a glass of complimentary wine, which was delightful.  (She sure knows the way to my heart)  I opted for the black shellac polish as Halloween is nearing, and my nails look so happy!  They are literally smiling at me!  She took her time doing my nails and made sure they were perfect!    I would highly recommend coming here because she delivers quality service at a great price.  (623) 329-9443.

My husband and I came here a few weeks ago, because it was hot and they had a sign outside that read "best margaritas in town".  "Heck yes", I thought to myself.  I should've kept driving.  Let's start with the chips and salsa.  The chips were stale, and the salsa was some sort of red water with no other flavor.  There was nothing to "scoop" as it had no actual tomato, onion, cilantro, or other yummy ingredients you find in salsa.    Next we ordered guacamole and margaritas.  The margaritas were far from the best in town.  In fact, they were kind of weird.  It's hard to describe, they were blended, but somehow formed into some funky salty foam.  The guacamole had one ingredient, which was avacado.  Again, no spice, cilantro, jalapeno, or other ingredients you'd typically find in a good guac.  This place is bland at best has no imagination, no quality...almost like they don't care what they are giving their customers.    I was very disappointed in my visit and will not be returning.  I will also add that I used the restroom and there was no soap, so I'm not sure how the employees are washing their hands, but it's not happening after their restroom use.    Bottom line, don't bother with this place.
