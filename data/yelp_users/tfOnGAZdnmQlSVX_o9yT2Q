Very nice service.  The food was lacking big time! I came here because of the bbq ribs pulled work all that yummy stuff and it was not what i expected. Everything was very dry and chewy. Maybe I came  on the wrong night because it was very slow in there.  I don't think I'm coming back.

I hate giving a bad review but this place was disappointing to me. I came in for a root touch up for blonde ; asked for platinum blonde; she Denise recommended I use olaplex on my hair which she charged extra 40 dollars all together was 160, with tip I spent 200. She made me pay before I was done. The result was not what I expect it I had strands of orange in my hair not to say the blow dry and style the girl used way too much oil on my hair so I was left with oily orange hair. I called in the next day to have it fixed and she took me in put a few foils only in front and was still a bit yellow . After she had her daughter wash my hair she told me she doesn't have time to blow dry me and I asked to do it myself and she said no cause it's against state board rules. Found that later that was a total lie. I said ok and left with wet hair :( Oh and while she had her 13 year old daughter wash my hair she started talking Vietnamese with her either telling her what to do or whatever. Very rude and unprofessional! I left feeling like Ive just been to a cheap nail salon with Vietnamese people talking whatever about you :(

I've been to many places this is by far the best one and I wouldn't go anywhere else. The staff is very friendly and my favorite person Mimi does an excellent job at nails, and eyebrows. They take their time to make you feel comfortable and make sure you are happy. Every pedicure comes with a foot massage that is so so good! Absolutely LOVE this place!
