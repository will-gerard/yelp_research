This review is based on Bank of America as a whole. They are just horrible especially with disputes, even when given documents supporting any type of transactions that the seller has been less then ethical Bank of America supports the shady seller. Nothing less would be excepted from the bank they got bailed out by the taxpayers for their shady derivatives fallout

I have been coming to Kona for a very long time and what keeps me coming back is the great food, awsome happy hours and great staff that work here.   You really can't go wrong with this place, try the happy hour from 3pm to 7pm or reverse happy from 9pm to 11pm Mon-Thur & Friday & Sat from 10pm to 12pm.   The managers are great here, Shadi when managing runs a tight ship here.  Breana, Brett, Joe and Russ are awsome bartenders.  Gina, Jen, Sarah and Heather are great wait staff.

Ahi wontons keep me coming back they are no joke and now that I added avocado to them, they are like crack. Always a good place to do people watching especially women what's there to complain about it's in the mall, women and malls go hand-in-hand so they come here to have a couple drinks.

Excellent service all the best of Starbucks has to offer, they get know you here. Since its in the mall, it's great for people watching and seeing all the exotic sports cars that valet in the mall when you sit outside.

This venue sucks could care less of the remodel or VIP section for douchy music scene types. Reminds of going to Mexico where they try to squeeze ever penny out of here, you already pay for your tickets with fees and they charge $7 for parking? PS to the idiot that said the Crescent Ballroom is disorganized and all over the place? That describes The Crapquee . Crescent Ballroom is the only venue in Phx that is worthwhile to see bands like M83, The Naked and Famous, We Were Promised JetPacks, etc. to which these bands played there. Crapquee is the place you want to go to give your money away.

Horrible experience here, had to stay here as my house was getting remolded. Staff was friendly and I think they put up with so much crap, but Ron who was manager here sucks. Incompetent manager who doesn't communicate with guests and should find another line of work. Wifi does not work as other said, it got upgraded while I was there but still slow. I left due to being harassed by Ron about my dog, again no communication from that idiot. Had to get corporate involved, which they did refund me some money. I would not recommend this place at all.

Not to be lame but this is a fun place to go, first time I went was on a First Friday. The place was packed, dj playing in a corner. It just reminds of a hipster bar in San Diego. The music is just right for me, the bartender women are hot : ) the women here are hot, but becareful of the damaged ones which will bring up a bar from 10 years ago lol

What can be said excellent for bike riding, but sometimes walkers don't understand that's a 2 way lane not 1 way and it's all about you.   Anyways great area to exercise and take the dog out for a walk.   See all the hotties getting exercise for a week of drunken debauchery.   It's the holy Grail of hotness so use with caution or else you may end up running into one.

My friend Sang raved about this place, so we went there tonight. This was my first time here so  I ordered the combo burger with cheese and everything on it after Sam recommened it. She was dead on, the burger was mouth watering and the fries were perfect with the fries sauce. I was left feeling full and happy.   I think Sam made my burger expereince the best as I was a newbie to the place and she helped me pick out the right burger, the owner should give this girl a raise, shes awsome!!!  I will be coming back for more burgers : )

Some may think this not a great location But I have to say it's the best to get in and out quickly. It seems to be a lot slower then the main branch o Osborn, which makes going in and out an ease. Park behind and in front of Starbucks for a sure parking spot then head over to CrackBucks for crack.

They deserve 0 stars, Worst urgent care ever 1 person to staff this place. Expect to wait over an hour to even take a simple pee test. They also let someone ahead of me, this place should be staffed better.

When I first got my Maxima I would have given them 5 stars as Eric the service guy was great at getting my car in and giving me a loaner if I needed it. But how the times have changed.  This was first and last Nissan ever, coming from a German Marquee that was $$$ to repair, my Maxima was always in the shop for items that American Cars are known for falling apart. "Nissans go on forever"? Not this car.  My Maxima had 69k miles when I bought it, low miles in my op. I had Riverview fix the master cylinder for my 6 speed transmission. Then I had them fix the plastic tensioner issue that Nissan knows about. Within 2 months of getting this Maxima I spent over $1500 to fix these items. Up to this point they would have gotten 5 stars.   It rained one day and my moonroof started to leak like crazy, I called up Eric and left him a message stating that I needed to get my car in because of the moonroof leaking. I never received a call back, I left 2 more messages. No calls backs at all. I was like hmmm, so I looked up the issue online to see if other Maxima other have experienced this issue. Not suprising there had been a recall on the rubber gasket that is around the moonroof.   I had to call Nissan Corporate to file a complaint on Riverview for not checking out my car. Nissan Corporate themselves are a joke, they acknowledged that my car had the gasket replaced but that I would charged a fee to have the moonroof checked out by another dealership.   Recalled part that is not correctly fixed and I have to pay a fee at another dealership? I asked Nissan Corporate to have the Service Manager give me a call and tell me why I can't even get my car in for service.   At this point if I could give River a -5 they would get it, the Douchebag Service Manager, doesnt even comment on why Eric has not returned my calls, instead he proceeds to say that my car was invloved in a car accident? And that's why I am experiencing the issues I am. Clean Car Fax states other wise, pointless why he even stated this. I knew at this point I bought the wrong car and the Riverview was a waste of time.   I will say Eric was a pretty great guy and I dont know why I never received callbacks but after this expereince, Riverview gets a fail.

Just awful service, sat outside the patio and waitress acknowledged us by giving us menus. Waited for at least 15 minutes and than another couple sat at the patio and got served within 2 minutes. Walked out, not bothering with that type of service.

Sadly this bar is very typical of Scottsdale bars that charge high end prices for food but come up very short. Come in for Monday Football with a friend. Waitress came over within 3 minutes and suggested that it was Cheesy Monday, half off Mac n Cheese or Cheese Bites. Call me simple, who doesn't like a Mac N Cheese plate? Order a Orange Blossom, which tasted flat? I took a couple of more sips and yes indeed it was flat, waitress comes over after 10 minutes, and I tell her that the beer tastes flat, she tells me beer can't go flat? Having thrown a couple of keggers, I know otherwise. She tells me that she is going to ask them to change the keg (yeah right). I got another Orange Blossom and it still tastes flat. I deal with it. Waiting for the Mac N Cheese, I notice that the place isn't that bad of a place to hang out, it could be maybe be a decent alternative to The Lodge, this was before my next experience.  So the Mac N Cheese comes out, The first thing I noticed is that it comes in 2 small skillets, 1 bowl would make clean up a lot easier, but hey I like simple things. My friend and I notice that there is no real cheese sauce on the Mac N Cheese, so we take a bite to see if maybe it is at the bottom. Nope, there is a slim sauce on this so called "Mac N Cheese". We ask the waitress, if we ordered Mac N Cheese or some noodles? She tells us, "we"ll you don't want too much sauce it will ruin it". Nope its already ruined. As the menu stated "Mac N Cheese with cheese sauce, bacon and bread crumbs" The bacon was fake and bacon that comes in a shaker, which I didn't think they made anymore. She brought out some more sauce, which made it ok. How can you ruin Mac n Cheese? Ask Boondocks because they butchered it. Upon getting our bill, I noticed that the waitress charged us $1.00 for the cheese sauce. Classy move Boondocks. I wont be coming back here, ever again. The menu prices don't justify the food they serve you, I can imagine how the $18 ribs are? No Thanks....

Wow so the reviews about Ricky's running out of food are true, I thought they were a joke. No joke folks I went here last night with with a friend on Labor Day weekend. You would expect them to have a stock of food,right? Hell No! I would normally give this place a 5 because of the great chicken tacos they had, but after reading reviews, I'm sure they screwed those up. Anyways chicken tacos is what I ordered and they told they were out of chicken, beans and rice. My friend ended up ordering steak fries and I ordered a quesadilla. I guess it was ok, too much vodka in me to remember. But I remember Rickys running out of food. My question is If Rickey's so damn worried about spending money on food supplies, why you even in business? #1 reason why you will go out of business and these reviews will warn others

I have been to here a lot and the service is always great and there never seems to be a line when I go. If you go during rush hours expect to wait because all the crackheads need their caffeine That's the way Starbucks want it, anyways good place Wifi is great and seems better then other locations.

I am giving this place five stars for the food as the Tacos are the bomb and the sauces that you get with them are so damn good as well, get the beet or avocado sauce, they just make the Tacos amazing, which they already are.   I am giving the bar staff especially Jen 10 stars for serving the best drinks, I don't know what the Snottdale crowd is complaining about the service being slow? Seems some of these reviewers are use to people catering to themselves, Diego Pops is laid back, no need for that garbage.   The only problem we had was I brought my dog after coming from the Dog Park, the girl manager on duty was just so you know we don't allow dogs on the patio, I was like didn't know Since its a awesome patio for dogs. My dog is well behaved and people seemed to be not bothered by him. He was getting a lot of hellos and hey's, manager comes over and states " we cant have your dog here" while I was eating my tacos and drinking a beer? I told her we would leave once we were done, I've been here since the beginning since this placed opened and she's a new manager, but the way she said it  the second time was completely "rude" and there was no need, since my dog was sitting by my chair at the bar and there was so issues. Its too bad Diego Pops doesn't allow dogs here, because it has the perfect patio for it.  I still will come here after this experience, because I am about good food and great service from the friendly servers and bartenders.
