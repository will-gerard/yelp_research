I recommend only going to the 35th Ave and Thunderbird location if you want the best version of this chain. I would say ask for "fresh off the grill" because it is worth the wait, but I think the cashiers are trained to actively ignore this request.

Simply the most amazing egg rolls in Phoenix! You get a great amount of food for a great value.

Simply the best tacos you will find in Phoenix. I have tried most of the menu, the fish tacos are amazing, the quesadillas are excellent, and the oaxacan hotdog is simply superb. The only thing wrong with this place is that they ever close. The salsas have great flavor but could definitely use some more heat, but the guac sauce just pushes everything to another level.  The area can seem a little sketch from the outside but you will not regret going inside.

This is a complete scam. Like the first review this merchant marked my Living Social as used even though they did not contact me at all in 2 weeks despite multiple voicemails and e-mails sent. Living Social has provided me a refund. Do not trust this business.
