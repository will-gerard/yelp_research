Excellent customer service I'll be back when I need new tires. On a busy Saturday morning I was greeting immediately by a friendly staff member. I was expecting to be sold a new tire as I didn't think that the damaged one I had could be saved. The store had about 15 people in it and the wait for my tire repair was over an hour and a half. They actually texted me in about 45 minutes to let me know the tire was fixed. Not only did they not try to up-sell me to something I didn't really need, the service was completed before the expected time, but the repair was free, I was surprised and impressed at this and will definitely be back for my rotation and balance in 6k miles. Great location!

Exceptional food, value and service.   Any lunch special offered here is a fantastic value as it comes with fried rice, spring roll, wontons and entree. The mu shoo pork and pork fried rice and pot stickers are the best I've had in a long time and food is prepared fresh and quickly. I mostly order for pick up, which you can add special requests to such as spice level and add or omit specific ingredients. In fact, I have most of my entire office "addicted" to the flavor of The Wok Express to where we order at least once a week. I just ordered the Orange Beef today for the first time and I'm  excited to say that I think I've found a new favorite! I'm treated very well by the staff/owners here and will never go to another Chinese Food restaurant in the Scottsdale area.  Make sure you try the Orange Chicken lunch special if you're a fan of the stuff. This is the BEST OC you will find, they fry it up extra crispy, and you'll never go back to Panda Express after you have had it here!

Disappointed.  Went here on July 3rd and should have made a note that the breakfast places that I was driving by had waiting lines in front but this restaurant did not. I had read some prior reviews that this was a great place to have breakfast and I had been meaning to try it out so me and my friend decided to spend our day off breakfast at this place. I ordered the SOS and she ordered the Chorizo Scrambler (ever the Mexican patron...)  The portions were of decent size, the hashbrowns were crispy, but my SOS tasted like it was made with a full container of Morton's Salt and my eggs were way under cooked from how I ordered them. My friends chorizo was ok but the tortillas were the quality of store bought- fresh would have mad a big difference. Maybe we ordered the wrong things...?   I can say the service was good, our server knew the menu well and came to check on us several times to fill our drinks.   I realize I could have complained and sent the food back but I come from the restaurant industry and I just hate to complain. I know that I won't choose this place again when there are much better diners to spend my money at which aren't so mediocre.

Tried this new hot little spot today since there's been som hype about it on the social networks and I can say that it did not disappoint! Staff was friendly and the kitchen was open concept so you could easily see the cleanliness in the back. I had the Chili Relleno Burrito, a first time experience to eat a CR that way, and it was fantastic. The tortilla was clearly made from scratch and the cheese was piping hot and delicious. My friend ordered the Barbacoa Burrito and reported that it was very tasty- the meat being seasoned well.  I will be back for more and was slightly disappointed that I had eaten a snack before I came here as I would have tried the RBC! Go check this place out!!
