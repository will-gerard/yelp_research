The decor is cute but the staff handling orders are not up to par.  I went there 3 days in a row and got orders to go and everytime something was either missing or simply the wrong food.  The operations leave a lot to be desire and they need to improve on it.  Not giving the customer what they want is a sign of failure in my eyes.  They need to get it together.  Furthermore, the staff is extremely rude.  They did not even apologize even after I took the wrong item back.  They need to attend customer service and logistics 101

The Kale Cesar Salad is amazing.  The steak on the dinner menu is right on if you ask the server not to poor the salad all over it because the steak will taste too vinegar-ry and tart.  I like to have my steak served without the sides piled on top of it.  Just incase I dont want the flavor mixing.  The trout is a MUT HAVE.  The decor is beautiful and veru modern (reminds me of the NE restaurants).  The servers are AMAZINGLY polite and the bar tender is the same.  The greeter or host sets the tone with a beautiful smile and welcoming warm and polite "Welcome"  Great job.
