In the mood for quick and amazing Mexican food? Los Taquitos is the place to go! Weather it be for Street Tacos, a massive Burrito, or tamales, you can expect an awesome meal here.  Meg and I have come to Los Taquitos more times than I can count. The service is always quick and friendly. With their new renovations they now have a wide open and colorful dining area with plenty of tables for groups big and small.  Of the many things we've had, it's a tie between the Street Tacos and the Tamales plate as my favorite. The three street taco plate comes with all the fixings, your choice of taco meat (which can be different for each one), rice and beans. I recommend their Carne Asada which has the perfect flavor to it.  The tamale plate is the closest thing to my Nana's homemade tamales I've found here in the valley. The beef tamales were really fluffy with spicy red chili beef cooked in. The plate comes with two tamales which, like the tacos, can be a mix of their three flavors: Beef, Chicken, or Cheese.   I can go on and on about all the things we've had there because we keep coming back any time we get the chance. The food speaks for itself as some of the best in Phoenix.

Meg and I were in the mood for a lazy night in and decided to try out a new place to pick up pizza from. We decided on Buono's because it was close by and had a lot of good reviews, including some from our friends here on Yelp.  I can't speak to the dine-in experience since we took it home. But there was definitely no confusion on what style pizza to expect. New York memorabilia everywhere you look! Very open dining are with plenty of space and a couple TVs on the walls in places that can be easily seen depending on where you sit. Would be a good place to meet up with some friends and watch a game.  Staff seemed friendly enough but since we were doing a pick-up order we didn't really talk to them very much.  The pizza on the other hand was a bit disappointing. We decided to get a 14"  Neapolitan style pepperoni pizza. The first thing we notices when we got the pizza home was a load of grease. Given the type of pizza we got I expected some grease from the pepperoni but this was more than a little.  Cheese didn't really have much flavor and the dough wasn't very memorable. I kind of expected more for being around as long as they have.  Admittedly, it may have been a bad night and maybe the Sicilian would have been better. You'll have to decide for yourself. As for me though, it may be a while before I give Buono's another go.

Pei Wei has always been a great way to grab a quick bite to take home on a busy weekday and used to be a stand-by for Chinese food when I lived in 'Tukee. So it only made sense that while Meg and I were dog sitting in the area that we decided to pick some up. We quickly found out that things definitely weren't like they used to be.  I first noticed that they had drastically reduced their menu since I was last in, seeming to focus more on their lettuce wrap options since those are their most popular item. No problem! They still had Kung Pao on their menu so we were fine with that. Took home a regular sized order of Kung Pao Chicken (requested extra hot) with lettuce cups and a side of brown rice.  The amount of Kung Pao we got was barely enough for one person. We're talking maybe 2/3 cups of Kung Pao total. If this was a regular order, I'm scared to see what a small order would have looked like. After sitting down to eat it we found that not only was this a ridiculously small portion but was bland, bland, bland. Not even a hint of spice to it and the chicken appeared to be just lightly dusted with seasoning as if someone put it on as an after thought. After stomaching it in hopes to at least be satisfied for the night, we quickly found out it was not enough for two people and we ended up going out for more food elsewhere after.  Sad to say but there has definitely been a decline in quality food wise. From flavorless food to small portions that would only satisfy you is you ate a mountain of rice with it. With other local offerings nearby, It may be a long while before I give Pei Wei another try.

Just so-so for a coffee place. There's a nice atmosphere and plenty of space if you wanted to study or chat with friends. The biggest problem though are the drinks. When a large chain like Starbucks or the independently owned coffee place that took up residence in your previous location has you beat on pricing, there had better be some mind blowing quality to back it up. Sadly, I was disappointed in the results.  For two tall (12oz) iced drinks we spent $10, and a dollar of which was just for the ice! Seriously, there's no reason to charge an extra $0.50 just to ice my drink down and so far this is the only place that charges extra for a cold drink. As for the pricing, I could walk out of most other coffee places with a Venti (20oz) or more for that price. Still though, I was hopeful in the quality of the coffee.  There's a unique combination of flavored mochas that you can order like the Milky Way Mocha, the Almond Joy mocha, and Black Forest Mocha just to name a few. The flavors sound great in thought but in practice there wasn't much to write home about. I got the Milky Way mocha since the combination of white chocolate, dark chocolate, and caramel sounded like a good mix. Would have been better of asking for an espresso in a glass of milk because that's mostly what I got. None of the other flavors were present except for coffee laced milk. Now I know that's what most of these mocha drinks are but at least there's a hint of the flavor that was ordered. Not a bit of it in this one.  I'm not sure how their black coffee is so for the manic coffee only drinkers, I can't speak to the quality of their brew. But I can say that $5 for 12oz of milk is way too much. I may try Gold Bar again sometime, but won't be for a while

Meg and I decided to drop in to the Rock Srpings Cafe thinking "What's the best way to end a trip to Sedona/Jerome? Grab some pie on the way to nosh on when we get home!" So we pulled in and got in line to grab some of this "world famous" pie.  Now, going in Meg had read that the service for the cafe was pretty lacking and we were fine with that/ We were eager to get home and figured that we would pop in, get our pie and hit the road. Well.... turns out the service overall needs a major tweek. Pretty much everyone that worked there seemed very irritated that they had to work. Not a one of them were smiling and most of the staff was very curt and dismissive.  But we figured fine, whatever. This pie is going to be bomb so it'll be worth it. Taking the advice from many other yelpers, we decided to get the JD Pecan Pie. We then stood in line, marveling at the novelty candy then immediately cringing at the price and putting it back. Come on guys....$3 for a stick of rock candy that goes for $0.50 in any convenience store? I dun think so... I would not be satisfying my candy craving here.  We checked out and took the final 45 min. haul back home and stuffed our pie slice in the fridge so it would cool down some after being in the AZ heat for the duration of the drive. After unpacking and getting the Sedona Red out off my skin from this morning's hike, I got to taste my half of this pie. And boy...I tell ya...I shoulda saved my money.  There was really nothing that stood out to me about this pie. There definitely was no hint of JD or any alcohol for that matter in this $5 pie. The crust was about what I'd expect but the topping could use an overhaul. I don't think chopped up pecans when I get a pecan pie, I think whole pecans. I want my Pecan pie to have a crunch and this one was on mute.  Dis-a-pointing. For the price we paid for this "world famous" pie, we should have just hit up Costco on the way home and payed $5 more for their massive pecan pie which is so good it even put my Nana's homemade one to shame (Her own words!).  So in summary, don't expect any warm fuzzies when you go in there and don't expect anything that knocks your socks off as far as pie goes. Very creative decor and a lot of selection so there's always the chance we got a bum pie. But given how rarely I go that way, I won't be going out of my way for this one

To start, I've only had the Sushi here so I cannot speak to the quality of the actual BBQ plates.  The girl and I came here for a going away dinner with a large group of people. The service was not great. Understandably it's a large group so I expect a lull in service but when we have to correct an unfriendly server 3+ times, getting dirty looks each time oven though the mistake is not on our end, then having to remind the cashier what we bought when we decide to head home is a bit ridiculous. Especially given the 18% gratuity they hit us with for a large group. Wouldn't have tipped them more than 5% with the type of service we got. Again, I would say this was a result of it being a large group except nearby tables of 2-4 people were experiencing the same problems.   The sushi itself was extremely underwhelming. We did not do the all you can eat because we figured four rolls at $8 a pop would be enough for the two of us. Honestly would have been better off saving our money, buying a 1 pound bag of instant rice and eating that instead. The sushi was essentially a big rice roll with little to no fish. We got the Las Vegas Roll, the Rainbow Roll, Tiger Roll, and the Heart Attack roll. The Vegas roll was mostly doughy breading, the Tiger roll and Rainbow Roll were okay but with little meat, and the Heart Attack Roll was a disastrous mix. Eel sauce, BBQ sauce, and pseudo-cheese sauce DO NOT mix well.  All in all, I was not impressed. The BBQ plates may be better but honestly I would rather try a different Korean BBQ place before coming back here after this experience. If you do decide to try Takamatsu out, avoid the sushi at all costs.  UPDATE: Sadly I will not be coming back here again. I'm on day two of food poisoning since I ate at Takamatsu and I definitely don't think it'll be worth my money or health for a repeat performance. Leaving two stars up since I cannot and will not be trying the barbeque. which I have heard is actually supposed to be good.

Finally! After trying about 10 different places looking for good, spicy Mexican style food near north Chandler, we found our new favorite place. Have come her during regular and late night dining hours and have not been disappointed yet. Great atmosphere, especially on the patio during cooler days because the waterfall and cavern like area around the patio makes you feel like you're really in a cavern. Staff was great at keeping the table well stocked with water, gave helpful recommendations for dinner, and is always friendly.  As for the food, the food is fantastic. At a gance, the menu seems a little pricy but you find out why when the food comes around. Have used the free chips and salsa check-in offer every time. The salsa isn't very spicy but is very flavorful. Doesn't look or taste pre-made and tastes great. The seasoned chips that come with it were good too. Just have to be careful not to fill up before the main pate comes your way because the dinner plates are huge! First time I came I had the Enchantment Platter and second time I got the Carne Adovada Burrito from their late night menu. will say this for the spice levels on the menu: they aren't messing around. Very accurate when it comes to heat intensity so if you like it hot this is a good place to go.   The Enchantment Platter has a little bit of everything: chilli relleno, chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito with red and Hatch green chilli sauce, rice, black beans, and a sopapilla. I hope you didn't think I was joking about the size of these plates. FRIGGIN HUGE!!! You definitely get what you pay for in spades. Very good chilli relleno. Crispy with good filling. I can't stand eggy/soggy rellenos that most restaurants have so was very happy.  The chicken enchilada was very flavorful with a good kick back from the chili sauce. chicken inside was moist with good seasoning. The carne adovada burrito was great. Again, good spice and seasoning for the beef and not dry at all. The red chilli on the burrito had a good flavor but wasn't too spicy. Not complaining though because the bee inside had enough kick for me without the sauce adding to it. Also, spiced black beans? Nom! Rice is what it is, not that I go out to eat for the sides. The Sopaipilla was nice and flaky. Good to help soak up the chili sauce. Waste not want not! Ended up taking half of this plate home for a very tasty lunch.  The late night Carne Avodada burrito is the same as the one that came on the Enchantment platter, just bigger since it's on it's own. Came with black beans and rice. Also had to try the Sopaipillas for desert. Again, very flaky and warm with a good dash of powdered sugar on them. Served with honey of course.  Have got to say, this is by far one of the best Mexican style restaurants I've been to to date. Will definitely be coming here when I need my spice fix! Great place to bring your friends for the atmosphere or if you wanna watch them burn up from the heat for a laugh! XD

The girl won tickets to Carlos Mencia so I finally got to check the Improv out. Fantastic venue for comedy. Very easy to see the stage no matter where you're seated. And if you need to get up for a restroom run, they put the show through the restroom speakers so you really don't miss a thing. I didn't try any of the food so I can't speak to the quality but it seemed reasonably priced for their size. The drinks however were very highly priced.  Understandable since it is an Improv and they make most of their money off the drinks but $25 for four bottled beers is a bit hard to swallow. There are no draft beers which is a bit of a let down. The mixed drinks looked interesting but I did not sample any so I don't know how good they are. The waitress was very pleasant and did a good job of discretely checking in on us throughout the show. The rest of the staff was also very professional. It was also nice to see that they do address people who are being overly obnoxious or heckling the performer so that they don't take away from the show. Overall a great experience and will definitely come to another show here in the future.

We first found this place when I moved to Chandler last year sometime in August looking for something cold and tasty to eat after dinner. Found Gelato 64 by mistake here on yelp while looking for a different Gelato place and decided to give it a try. Was hooked after the first visit. Good prices with lots of choices to sample from. Their seasonal fare is always delicious! How could one turn down pumpkin pie or peppermint flavor during the holidays? At one point Gelato 64 runs was almost a Friday night routine for us.  Then in January this year we got word that they had closed their location to move to Gilbert Gateway Town Center. Not knowing they were only closed for a week, I had to endure my girl's withdraws for five months, being asked to drive all the way out to Gilbert for Gelato just so she could have it. Freaking addict... Needless to say when she found out the Chandler location was open still, we had to come back to get our fix.  Not much had changed in our absence thankfully. All the usual flavors were still there and some new summer treats. Had to try out the coconut cream last time with Stracciatella (one of my favorites). If you love coconut it's a definite win since it's got lots of shredded coconut throughout. Always a fun experience trying out the flavors so will definitely be coming back when we can.

I got a firm reminder as to why I prefer O'Reilly's over AutoZone when I came in here a few weeks back. The customer service is ghastly. I came in to AutoZone to return a filter removal tool that I had bought a week before from a different location that didn't fit. The cashier that I worked with was rude a curt with me when I mentioned I wanted to return the part, giving me an irritated look as if I was bothering him. Didn't bother to talk to me at all throughout the return and bruskly gave me my refund. I would say maybe this particular employee was just having a bad day except that this seems to be the norm when I go to any AutoZone which is why I only come to one if I can't find a part that I need immediately at O'reilly's across the street.

I've been shopping at this Fry's for the last year and the experience started of great but in the last month we've noticed a steady decline in quality in certain places. In the last month we've noticed that the produce quality has been very bad. Almost all the apples were rotting no matter what kind they were. The oranges were extremely mushy to the point I wouldn't risk buying any. There were cherry tomatoes growing mold in the packaging. And there were a fair amount of fruit flies inhabiting the produce area. To make things worse, I tend to shop on Monday/Tuesdays when they get their new stock and even with people stocking the area, none of the rotting fruit was being removed and if they had just put the fresh stuff out, I'd hate to see what was there before. Since we do a lot of our produce shopping at this Fry's this is beginning to be a major problem for us. I'm looking to give this location one last shot before going to a different Fry's or next door to Walmart.  Aside from Produce the rest of the store hasn't been much of an issue. Never had  a problem with any of the departments. Have only had one bad batch of meat so far which, for going there a whole year, is pretty good in my books. If the Produce section gets fixed, will definitely change my review.

It's been about a year since I first switched to Sprouts for my groceries and it's about time I updated this dusty thing :p  Originally I was only going to Sprouts for the fresh produce. The fruits and vegetables I've bought at Sprouts have always been fresh and affordable. The produce is well organized and well stocked. Only section that I wish was stocked a little better are the peppers. There's been more than once that there have only been one or two Jalapenos if any. Admittedly, the peppers we buy are probably not in high demand (not many people buy a slew of Jalapenos and Habaneros every other week) so I can't hold it against them.  Now however, I'm finding I d almost all of my shopping here. Since our discovery of the bulk spices, we've been refilling our spice bottles for half the price of what it costs elsewhere. This comes in particularly handy when I need some obscure spice that I need when trying out a new recipe. It's a lot easier to buy just what I need instead of a $5.00+ bottle of a Spice I will rarely use. And if you like to really spice up your homemade chilli, the New Mexico Chili Powder will knock your socks into next Tuesday.  Speaking of bulk sections, you have any idea how much we've been saving with the bulk baking goods? Holy crap! Again, great for the obscure item that you only need a little of but since the girl and I have started using other grains, we've been hitting this section up more often. I pound quinoa is cheaper from the bulk than it is from the box. And can easily fill up my flour, sugar, and other baking items for less and as needed.  Lastly, the meat section. Honestly I never really thought there was much of a difference between normal meat and grass fed. Boy did I learn how wrong I was. Chicken is almost always on sale here and tastes amazing. Not to mention I can easily make a meal for two out of one chicken breast given how big they are. And the bulk cut bacon is to DIE for. Bought it on a lark a few weeks back and will probably never buy bacon elsewhere (DAMN YOU SPROUTS!! XD). As I mentioned in the old review, the premade/premarinated meals are also great. The Pollo Asada and Spinach/feta stuffed chicken breasts are some of our favorites.  Food aside, let's talk the customer service. The meat counter staff are always super helpful. Not only are they friendly when working with you, they go above and beyond to help you. I found out the hard way that I am atrocious at removing skin from a fish fillet the first time I bought one. the second time we wanted fish, I asked if they could remove the skin after weighing it and they didn't even bat an eye. Went home with a freshly skinned fillet that I was able to cut into nice fish steaks instead of butchering them. The girl even got help the last time she came in needing a custom cut on a pork roast. Had we asked the same thing at other grocery stores, the staff would be reluctant to help if not just flat out rude about it. Sprouts on the other hand have always been helpful and happy to do so.  As for the cashiers and baggers, the majority of them are good natured and chatty making the checkout experience that much better. Particularly if you go during the downtime hours. I've had more than one instance where I left laughing with a smile on my face after working with them. Not something I can say about many places. You can genuinely tell that the people at Sprouts take pride in their jobs and are happy to be there. Because of these great experiences, they deserve the updated five star rating I'm giving them.  Sprouts has been my first stop for groceries for the last year and I have no reason to change that anytime soon! Sprouts, keep up the great work!

A great Irish pub right down the way from me. The atmosphere is great. The inside has an all wood appearance with a large fully stocked bar. Makes it feel like an authentic Irish pub. There's a good selection of whiskey and beer with plenty of interesting drink combinations available. The staff is always friendly and greats you on your way in and out.  As for the food, great burgers but even better Irish food. First time I came here for lunch and got the corned beef and cabbage. Was very fresh and flavorful. Could tell it was not a cookie cutter recipe. Will definitely need to come back and try out more of their dishes.

Love the atmosphere of this brewery. The staff is always friendly and dos a great job of keeping all their tables running. The food is great. Good pizzas and better burgers. The pricing is a little higher than normal but it's definitely worth it. Can't wait to come back, especially to watch the games during Basketball season!

Nothing like some affordable short order breakfast after a long night out. We frequent this Waffle House very often, and every time the service is always great. Very friendly hostesses/servers, clean tables, and rarely ever a wait over ten minutes even for this tiny location.   Our favorite dish is definitely the All-Star Special. Enough food to feed 2 people for $10? And we can split it?! SOLD!!  Always great food and great service at an affordable price. Definitely our favorite breakfast/hangover food.

Been going to this Sports Clips location for the last few months. Every time I've gone, I've always been seated no later than ten minutes after I get there and the staff is always friendly, talkative, and do an excellent job every time.

This was my first time coming here for  for Preston S.'s Back to Drinking UYE. I have to say I was a little skeptical about a tiki bar in the middle of Central Phoenix but I figured "hey why not?" And it was definitely worth the trip.  The place had a great atmosphere. The big patio outside looks like it would be great for large groups after the heat dies down. The inside was definitely not the over the top tiki room I expected. While it still had a lot of Hawaiian touches, it didn't bash me over the head with corniness like most places. Great music and was especially cool to be able to look up and watch Elvis'  Blue Hawaii projected on the wall above us.  The waiter Kyle (Since nobody else seemed to check their receipt ;p lol) was great. He was very patient with our large group, checked on our drinks often, and even got a virgin Hula Juice for the girl since she was DD in case I got a little too drink happy (Honest, she's not preggo you goof balls. I'm just a nut for rum drinks). He was even nice enough to make sure he cut the check up right for some of the other UYE attendants.  I started the night with a Mai Tai. Admittedly I am always wary about ordering mai tais at restaurants because it always ends up being some watered down fru-fru drink that looks like something a girl would drink. But the menu promised it was not your typical "fruity mai tai" so I decided to risk risk it. And they weren't kidding. I couldn't have gotten a better mai tai if I had gone to Luau in Hawaii. Nothing fru-fru about it and very strong. Kind of surprised there wasn't a limit on them but I wasn't going to push it after one of those. good rum and great flavor. Just the right mix of alcohol and pineapple juice.  For food we started off with the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls. They were fried perfectly with just the right amount of crisp. The vegetables and shrimp were very fresh and the coconut pineapple dipping sauce was great. Was a good size for two people but any more than that and you may want order an extra.  For dinner we shared the Shrimp Tacos. Again, props to Kyle for splitting this for us without us even asking since I completely forgot (was halfway through my mai tai by then so can you blame me?). The tacos were just okay but the salsa had a nice kick to it. From what I heard though I really need to grab one of the burgers next time I'm here.  Overall we had a great time and I can't wait to come back for more drinks and food.

Sleepy Dog Brewery is definitely one of my favorite new haunts. Meg and I dropped in on a whim to try out some new brews before meeting up with a friend on Mill. We were surprised at how hidden this gem is being tucked away in what looks like a business plaza. It's surprising how efficient they are with their space. The front half of the building is a lounge/tasting room with the brewery just behind the bar.  The tasting room is fairly cozy with a lot of fun dog-themed signs and decor. Comfortable free style seating with 6 screens dedicated to those who want to watch sports and one screen that has a constant rotation of dog pictures from patrons who tweeted in their photos.  While Sleepy Dog does not offer food, they make up for by allowing patrons to bring in whatever they want from outside. They even allow you to have food delivered to you there in the brewery. But for the snack happy drinkers, they do provide free popcorn with different seasonings to enjoy.  Meg and I went with a beer flight of their 6 standard beers. Most of the beers we had were fantastic!  I love both of their Hefeweizen style beers and both of their reds. I didn't really like their IPA but I don't like IPAs much to begin with so that's on me. But their Wet Snout Porter is definitely my new favorite porter. Smooth and Chocolaty without the knock back aftertaste that a lot of porters have.   When we got the bill, I was blown away with the deal we got. Their flight pours are not the least bit stingy, likely equaling a half a pint each.So when we ordered the flight, I was expecting the usual $9-$12 beer flights usually are. But $6?! For essentially 3 beers?! Almost feel like I robbed the place! I've never seen such low prices on awesome beers.  After our first experience, we had to come back and bring some people with us. So I chose Sleepy Dog Brewery to be the first stop in the Brews Cruise UYE event that I started up. We had roughly 15 people show up, all of which really enjoyed themselves. The staff was beyond friendly and almost ecstatic that they had such a crowd to work with on an otherwise slow Friday Night. Extremely enthusiastic and definitely tackled the challenge of a large group with ease.   All in all, I've had a great time every time I have visited Sleepy Dog and I look forward to returning again many times in the future.

After driving around for ten minutes on the wrong side of the parking lot, the girl and I finally found this hidden gem in Tempe. But I am glad we did.  I've been here twice so far and both times the burgers have been great. first time I got the chili burger and the second time I got a bacon burger with mushrooms. Both burgers were great. Good flavor and very fresh toppings. Admittedly I was a little underwhelmed with the chili but it may have been an off night so will give i another try. The fries are great especially with the Lobby's sauce. Both times I've been in the customer service has been excellent and very friendly. I've heard they make really good dogs and sandwiches as well so will definitely have to give them a shot sometime.

Took us a while but the girl finally found a good, locally owned yogurt shop. We needed one after some bad experiences with Zoyo and Orange Leaf. Always feels better supporting the local guys than the big company who could care a less about their patrons.  Aloha yogurt is a nice little place with some unique flavors. Loved the candy bar flavors like Twix! And the atmosphere was very friendly and warm. Got a good laugh out of the jumbo Mr. Potato Heads the were out on the tables.  The staff was very friendly. While the sample cups are not out for you to grab on your own, the staff is happy to hand you twenty of them if you ask. And one of them (I assume to Manager) was out on the floor chatting with the patrons and checking if we needed any help or sample cups.  There were plenty of topping to pick from and plenty of good flavors. Also, a BOGO check in deal? Heck yeah! Overall a great experience and next time I want Froyo, I know the first place I'm going!

The girl and I first came here when we are feeling a case of the sniffles and were wanting to nip it in the bud without cooking a hot soup ourselves. we came here again a few weeks ago with a friend because we enjoyed it so much.  The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere with tables for parties of any size. The food itself comes in huge portions so come hungry or share it with someone. First time I got Republic Ramen with beef and traditional toppings. Word of warning if you're not a fan of seaweed ask them to remove it or stick to original toppings. Had a good spice to it and the toppings went very well with it. Seaweed was a bit strong but that's to be expected. Downside to the traditional toppings is that if you do have seaweed with it and end up taking any home, the seaweed tends to overpower the soup to the point I couldn't eat it. So take a lesson from me and share the traditional style one in house with someone.  The second time I came here I got the Republic Ramen with chicken and original toppings. The original toppings has a lot of tasty veggies and no seaweed so would have been fine to take home if I hadn't finished it off. Only disappointment was the cubes of chicken that was in it does not absorb any of the broth and doesn't appear to have been preseasoned so the chicken itself was a little bland. Otherwise it was a great combo as well. Would just recommend sticking with beef.  The bottom line: Great food, great prices, and great atmosphere. So next time you want some great soup or are a little under the weather and want a quick fix, definitely give Republic Ramen a try.

After passing by it so many times when hitting up whole foods or sports clips, we finally decided to give this chain a shot.   There's a lot of flavors and few stood out as unique or hard to find like Pineapple, Snickerdoodle, and Oatmeal Cookie. With 17 flavors, you'd think you'd have ample opportunity to try some of them out.  Think again! The oh so friendly employee who gave us an absolutely wonderful scowl when we came in turned out to be the keeper of the sample cups too. And oh such a stingy keeper she was. We got one sample cup per person to go with a  nasty look for simply asking for one. Heaven forbid I want to try the yogurt before I buy it! That's $0.005 cents of yogurt that Orange Leaf is giving away per cup! We can't have that! Seriously, frozen yogurt shops are meant to be a fun place. This employee looked like she'd rather be having hot pokers stuck under her finger nails. And it's clear this is standard at this location because there's plenty of other Yelpers who've had a similar or worse experience when dealing with the staff.   And what the heck is the point of limiting sample cups?! And don't give me the "going green" crap. That defense is null when you don't offer any sort of reusable cup that you can buy to limit the paper waste from paper cups. There is no purpose to it other than to give patrons sticky fingers and risk cross contaminating the dispensers. Seriously, sample cup hoarding just makes me want to take that one cup, sample every single flavor at least twice, then walk out without paying a dime. [End rant]  Getting back on track, the yogurt was good but the topping bar was lacking. The fruit wasn't that good and if you don't want fruit, you have a limited selection of other toppings you can pick from.  Overall, with other chain yogurt shops that listen to their customer and a local shop popping up every few weeks, I'm not going to inconvenience myself to come back here again anytime soon. Would have been a one star but tossed them a bone for nice decor and the yogurt that was more cheerful than the staff.

Great beer selection, especially the beer fusions. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, quick service. Food is typical bar food, nothing special but didn't agree with my girlfriends stomach in the least. So four stars for the beer and atmosphere but wouldn't eat here.

When deciding on a place to go to dinner for my birthday, I decided to go to one of my usual favorites: Oregano's. This time, instead of going to one of the two Tempe locations, we decided to head out to the Chandler location for a change of scenery.  Like all Oregano's there's a good vibrant atmosphere and the staff is always friendly. The inside was a a little cold for us so we decided to go sit on the patio. The bar tender greeted us and wished us a good meal as we were taken out to the patio and later wished us a good night as we left. The patio at the Chandler location is probably the biggest patio I've seen so far as far as Oregano's goes. Very wide spread with a fire pit in the middle for the winter and two high power mister fans running to keep us cool. Was nice to be able to enjoy the fresh air without being cramped or dying from the heat.  Our waitress AJ was extremely friendly and was very helpful when recommending drinks on the menu. Even though it was the day before her day off, she did a great job of checking in on us, making sure our drinks were filled, and even took the time to chat with us, all the while juggling the other five tables in the same fashion. So major kudos to her for how well she did.  For starters, the girl and I got drinks. Meagan got the red sangria and I got the D'Liscious Rootbeer Float. I'm not a big wine fan but the Sangria was very good. A nice blend of fruit and wine. Definitely had a kick but was blended very well. The rootbeer float was very good as well. A blend of rootbeer and rum it definitely had that rum taste I like without being overpowering so even Meg enjoyed it, who normally isn't a fan of these kind of drinks.  Along with the drinks we also got the Oregano's Favorite Salad. I'm glad we agreed to split a Jr. size because if we hadn't we wouldn't have had room for dinner. This salad is huge. The regular size can feed a family of seven. The Jr is big enough for three to four people to share. The Oregano's Favorite is very well named. It has a nice mix of ingredients and toppings, including raisins, giving it a slightly sweet taste. It's one of our favorite standbys when we go to any Oreganos.  For Dinner, we got another one of our favorites: The Big Rig Pasta. This pasta has got a great kick to it. Just spicy enough to be enjoyable without sacrificing flavor. We always get the Big Rig with the two spicy sausages. For three bucks more, I don't think I could find sausage this tasty and spicy. I recommend slicing them up into bite size pieces and mixing it in with the pasta. Always a great choice.  And as if that were not enough, AJ got us a Pizza Cookie for us after Meg let her know it was my birthday. We got the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie since is one of my favorites. In Meg's words, Don't know who's idea it was to make these, but they should be slapped for making everyone fat XD The damn thing is addictive and extremely tasty. And why wouldn't it be? Half baked jumbo cookie with three ice cream scoops on it? What's not to like? Should definitely be split with three or more people if you plan on finishing it (not like that stopped us).  All and all, it's always a good time coming to Oregano's, no matter the location.

Our experience with Rehab started before we even got near the place. Meg was organizing a belated birthday get together for myself that turned out to have a lot more people coming than expected. Our guest list topped out at 21 by the time we were ready to set up the reservation. When we found out how big it had gotten, we began to worry we might get turned down. I mean a small place like this reserving 21 seats on a Friday night? Most places would've turned us down or charged a fee to reserve the space. But when Meg called in three days before the event Wylie, one of the owners, made it happen without a single hitch! No charge for reserving the space and no gratuity despite the size of the group. A good way to start an excellent experience.  Once there our server, David, went above and beyond to take care of us. Extremely friendly and took time to chat with us whenever he got the chance. He didn't have any problem splitting the checks for such a big group and did a great job of making sure everyone got the right bill.  The food itself was fantastic as well! I got a Ghost Burger (minus avocado) on a Pretzel Bun with onion rings instead of fries. This thing had a bite to it! Definitely spicy but not to the point it was inedible and the burger was cooked perfectly. The onions were very good. Admittedly the substitution price as a little high for five rings but the rings were very good size and fried just right.  I also got to sample the Reese's Pot Brownie as well. If you order one of these things, I hope you're sharing because four bites and I was beyond done. Lots of brownie and tasted amazing but very very rich in flavor. Would not order this for myself but perfect for groups to share.  All in all we had an amazing time there and the service was spectacular. I love the surfer vibe decor and all the unique burger combinations there were to choose from.  Would come back in a heart beat.

After reading a lot of good reviews for Nandos's, we decided to try it out back in April with high hopes of a very tasty meal.  Well.....that didn't happen. Like most Mexican food places, we started off with chips and salsa. The salsa was extremely bland. Would not be surprised if I found Costco sized bottles of Pace in the trash bin. Even went so far as to try out the Habanero salsa in hopes of a good spice. Tasted a little better than the regular but was still not spicy at all. Major disappointment.  But not as sad as our dinner. We decided to split the El Jefe Chicken Chimichanga. Like the salsa, was flavorless, filled with onion, and no spice. And the chicken looked and tasted like Fry's $5 rotisserie chicken after two microwave reheats. Depressing... Only redeeming quality was the atmosphere and satisfactory service. May give Nando's another try but won't be holding my breath.

On our way down from Paradise Valley we decided to go to Matt's Big Breakfast for brunch based on Meg's past visit for The Breakfast Club. Even at 10:30, the place was packed full to bursting with a large group of people waiting outside. After a twenty minute wait I found out why. The service was very quick and friendly and the food was great. I ordered the five spot breakfast sandwich. While the sandwich only came on it's own, it was easy to understand why when it arrive. The sandwich took up most of the plate with what was likely 2-3 eggs, two strips of bacon, and cheese all on a roll bigger than a softball. Honestly, if I could, I'd come for the bacon alone. Very thick cut and choice slices and well seasoned. The eggs were well cooked and very fresh and the roll was very light and flaky. I would definitely come back again though I would recommend coming early to beat the crowds if you can.

North Mountain Brewing was the second stop on the Brews Cruise UYE. Just from setting up a reservation for us, I could tell we were in for an awesome time!  I called in to reserve a table for our expected group of 18. I was worried I'd have to reschedule or have us at different tables when the hostess told me there was already a bigger group reservation for that same time. But she told me she'd have the manager Candy call me back to see what we could do.   Candy was quick to get back to me and not only was she more than accommodating to having both groups there, she even managed to set us up in a single table so we didn't have to be separated! She went way above and beyond to make this happen and I owe her a huge thank you!  I also want to thank our server Chris. He had the daunting task of taking care of all of us and did an amazing job.   The brewery itself was amazing. Great decor that included art pieces from local artists in a wide open dining area. There's enough screens in there for anyone to come in to watch the game over some brews.  Meg and I both shared an order of Lumpia and Poutine for dinner. The Lumpia was fantastic! Very flavorful and crispy with plenty to share between four people. The Poutine with braised short ribs and cheese curds is probably the best I have ever had. Very tender short ribs and gobs of cheese on a huge plate of fries. I also got to sample the crab dip which was awesomely buttery and creamy. Fantastic all around.  And then there was the extensive amount of brews. North Mountain has 12 different beers with a little bit of everything. I ordered a large sample and of the 8 I tried, my favorites were the Ryder of Broyhan and Barrel Aged CardinAle Red.   All in all, North Mountain Brewing Company was amazing. Great service, great food, and great beers. I cant wait to come out here again.

I'm breaking my usual 'two visit" rule for Tortilla Fish but there's a good reason; It was just THAT good!!  I met up with the girl for lunch on my day off, kind of leery about what I was getting into because I'm not really a fan of fish tacos. But I gotta give the local guys a shot and I'm glad I did.  Ordered the shrimp tacos, added beer battered fries for the table and snagged the free drink check-in offer. Didn't have to wait long for our tacos and was pleasantly surprised to find that they don't pre-build the tacos for you. After they cook up your fish and put it in a fresh corn tortilla, you get to put the rest of it together using the nearby bar. This is a HUGE plus for me because far too often I've had fish tacos elsewhere that were drenched with some nasty mayo based cream sauce that I can't stomach. Here though, I was able to load my shrimps up with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, some bomb salsa, and cilantro. WORD OF WARNING: They are not exaggerating about their heat levels. When they say hot, they mean hot. I went with the hottest salsa and got a good burn going, despite how used to spicy food I am. So choose with caution. One of the staff members was kind enough to give a couple of recommendations on what to put on the tacos as well which I'm glad I listened to them because I would have missed out on the cilantro sauce.  The end result? Freakin' excellent! Very fresh fish and fantastic toppings. Found out after I'd inhaled my first taco that all the sauces are made in house daily which explains why it tastes freakin amazing and fresh. The beer battered fries were also great. I recommend sharing them though because you get quite a bit.  Overall, a great dining experience and great customer service. My only gripe is that they close a bit earlier than other taco restaurants which makes it difficult for me to eat there for dinner given my work hours. Otherwise I'm glad I gave them a try. Will definitely need to come here again sometime soon.

Good pizza, great wings, and quick service for a Friday night pick-up dinner. Prices are great for the quality/size pizza you get. Wings are flavorfull and the hot wings have a nice kick to them. Nice atmosphere as well with friendly staff. Can't speak to any of the other meals they offer like sandwiches and salads...but I dun go to a pizza place for a sammich. Will definitely be coming back!

We brought Meg's car here for a quick wash in hopes of being able to enjoy an afternoon together before I had to go to work. We usually go to one of the other locations but this one was closer and there were some decent reviews so we decided to give them a shot. Had we known what we were walking into, we would have just skipped it.  We decided to get a VIP car wash but because the interior has a synthetic leather finish, we asked the sale man not to use polish on the dash. We were assured that they would only polish the plastics so we had nothing to worry about. Great! Just what we wanted. We went inside, paid for our wash, and plopped down on a couch to wait.  Should have known we were in for a mess when the salesman came back, hollering at the cashier to call more people in. I took a look outside and there were only 2 washers out facing about a dozen cars to wash. Definitely not an appropriate way to handle needing more people even if they were backed up.  20 minutes later and the car was done. Or so we thought...  The inside was drenched in the exact polish we told them NOT to use except on plastic. Now we had a greasy mess all over the dash. But I figured, get it home and give the dash a quick wipe down. 5 minutes, no big.  We got the car home and found out exactly how bad a job was done. Windows were streaky as hell, the back looked like it had barely been touched, tires still covered in road grime, mats and foot area was barely touched, and there was still bird crap on the roof! And to top it all off, the cleaning order was still marked on the rear door window! Come on!  I spent another hour and a half fixing these mistakes myself. It takes me maybe an hour to wash a car on my own. So what should have been a 30 minute quick stop turned into a 3 hour wash and rewash. So I ask: What was the point?! Definitely wasn't to have time because my entire afternoon ended up being shot because of it.  We definitely will not be returning to this location. It is not worth spending $20 on a shoddy wash job just so I can go home and re-wash the car myself.

If you're looking for a quick and fun tour to stumble away from, AZ Distilling Co if the place to go! Meg gifted me the Tour for Two Groupon for my birthday and, being a big spirits fan myself, I was excited to try out something new.  I will admit, the location is kind of hard to find. It's tucked away in cinder block warehouse building off the street with a small sign in front of the drive. We took Uber so we both could enjoy drinks without the risk of visiting Sheriff Joe. We drove past it two or three times without knowing it before we ended up having the driver drop us off at The Yard and walking there. So if you don't have a designated driver to go straight to the distillery, you may want to do the same and walk over from the Yard since it's only a minute or so walk and will save you a little on the drive.  The owner Jason greeted us on our way in and pointed us to the tasting bar where Garret was finishing up the previous tour. You can tell right away that they love what they do. Whether it be giving each other a hard time or laughing with the customers, they're definitely having a good time.  Garret did a great job summing up the tour right away. "This is our distillery. Now get your $#!+ and get out" failing to say it with a straight face. But in all seriousness, he did a great job explaining the distilling process, the alcohol proof before and after each stage, and what they do differently in their process that makes their spirits so unique. At each stage he took a moment to ask if we had any questions to be sure we had a good idea what they do.  After the 20-30 minute tour to see and understand the whole process before being led back to the bar for tasting. Despite the tour description, I can say that the pours were more than 0.5 oz a piece. We got to sample the Copper City Moonshine first which was very smooth with a clean taste.  The next one we got to sample was the Copper City Bourbon. Definitely a must have for any bourbon lovers out there/ Smooth and flavorful while still hitting you for your best Whiskey Face. Would blend perfectly with your favorite mixer.  My favorite by far was the Desert Dry Gin. Before you take a sip, you have to smell how fragrant this Gin is. Distilled with Lavender, Cinnamon, Coriander, Cumin, Cardamon, Apple, and Lime Zest, the smell of this gin alone is mind blowing. As soon as you taste it, you're hit with the awesome blend of flavors and how smooth the Gin is. Out of all the spirits we tried, this one made me think twice about not taking a bottle home.  The last sample on the tour list was their Vodka (I don't remember the name of it sadly). The Vodka was very smooth but didn't seem as potent as I would expect from a vodka. But potent or not was very enjoyable and would be great in a martini or mixed beverage.  Once we had all these we also got to try two cocktails they made exclusively in house - Apple Pie Moonshine and Bee Knees. Would have loved to swipe one of the bottles of Apple Pie Moonshine. Sweet, fragrant, and spot on Apple Pie flavor. Could easily get into some big trouble because was very drinkable and can't taste the Moonshine at all. The Bees Knees was also fantastic. Made with AZ harvested honey, lemon aid and their Gin, had just the right amount of sweet honey flavor with the kick of the gin's spice combination.  Would loved to have sampled their whiskeys but because of the demand, it costs extra for a flight. Given how messed up I already was by then, I felt it best not to tempt fate and risk having to pay homage in the morning.  All in all, I had an amazing time on this tour and definitely have some new favorite spirits to stock up on. I highly recommend making sure you've eaten recently before coming in or else you're going to end up on the floor. Will definitely make the trip out again to grab a few bottles n the future.

When Meg and I heard that Johnny's had opened up in place of Lobby's, it felt like Christmas had come around all over again. We immediately made our way out to Johnny's to try them out.   I got my usual standby: Cheese Burger with mushrooms. Meg got a combo burger so we could share the fries, drink, and fry sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly with the same great ingredients as it's predecessor. It's like they never left. The bun did taste a little different the first time around as if they used a potato bun or something but it didn't hurt the burger at all and they have either changed it back or it's no longer noticeable. Crinkle cut fries tasted great and the fry sauce is to die for.  Today, I decided to put Johnny's to the test. For anyone who as read my scathing review of Poritillo's, you know I had recommended coming here instead when it was still Lobby's, despite the fact I had not had an Italian beef here. My faith in Lobby's at the time was unshakable and I had faith that Johnny's was no different. Today proved me 100% right. Meg and I shared a half dipped Italian Beef sandwich with hot peppers. I will say this, Johnny's does not mess around with the portion size. This thing could feed four people that's how huge it is. But we destroyed it as if we hadn't eaten in weeks. The beef was well seasoned with an Italian herb blend, had the perfect amount of au jus sauce,  and the hot peppers were legit hot which is a major plus to me. I could not have been more pleased with this sandwich which means now I have to have an internal debate every time I come in on whether or not I want a burger or this awesome sandwich. Only critique I have is that it came wrapped up in paper which, had it not been dipped, would have been fine. But in this case or even a fully dipped one I would recommend asking for it in a container instead or risk accidentally eating the wrapping.  Every time we've been the staff has always been friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there. On our first visit and most of our subsequent stops here the manager/cook Carlos took the time to greet us and even come talk to us once he had caught up on the food orders. Very friendly and remembered our names (or nickname in my case, no judgement though ;p ) even after only the first visit. He even remembered Meg just from a Yelp Talk thread showing he definitely takes a lot of time and pride in what he does here.   All in all, Johnny's is an amazing experience with great food and great people. I am happy to have them back and as good as ever.

Since we were out and about in Tempe Market Place,  Meg and I decided to try Portillo's. we'd heard quite a bit about the place and figured we'd give it a try. In hindsight, we probably should have just kept driving home.  To start, I tried one of the chili hot dogs and fries. The dog was definitely as advertised; Tasted exactly like a Vienna sausages you get out of the canned foods aisle. And the chili tasted like they took a few steps down the same aisle to grab a can of Hormel. And to complete the shopping experience they took a stroll over to the freezer aisle for some good ol' Ore-Ida Crinkle Fries.  However, in the spirit of giving them a solid try, we decided to try the dipped Italian beef  based off multiple recommendations here. I'll give Portillo's on thing, they are consistent! Nothing like discount brand deli sliced roast beef drowned in with some poorly mixed Lawry's gravy then stuff in a bun and drowned again before flopping it on a plate. Was a greasy, salty mess of yuck!  Seriously it all tasted like I could have taken the exact same grocery trip and made the dogs, chili, fries, roast beef and gravy at home. It's possible that it was a really off day for Portillo's but I sincerely doubt I will be back to give them another chance.
