Crazy Jim's catered a lunch meeting I attended while in Phoenix, and I was so completely mesmerized by this amazing pizza that I barely paid attention to the meeting.  Remember Sbarro's? That's what this pizza reminded me of; giant, plate-sized slices of cheese and grease...mmmmm.   I would go back to Phoenix solely for more pizza.

I used to travel to Phoenix for work, which was one of the benefits of that job.  This restaurant in downtown Phoenix came highly recommended by several of the secretaries I was working with and since it was in walking distance of the office, I decided to give it a try.    To be totally honest, it sucked.  Complimentary bread and soup was served for starters.  The bread was stale and I've had better soup out of a can.  The server was so busy flirting with the tall and very tanned ladies at the table next to me to pay much attention to the rest of his customers.  He spent a good deal of the time ignoring me; I was constantly having to ask him for things I shouldn't have to ask for--such as a fork or a drink.    The menu is pretty extensive; though low on the veggie options.  I chose the bowtie pasta with veggies.  It was carrots, zucchini and peppers in a light herb sauce which was bland and served just barely warm.  Very disappointing!  Due to the slow service of the flirty waiter, I was there far longer than an hour and got back to work late, out about $15 and still hungry.  Don't waste your time!
