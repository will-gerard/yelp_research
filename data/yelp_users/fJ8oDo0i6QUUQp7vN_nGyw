No idea how this place has four stars.  The service is super slow.  I had the opportunity to meet clients here twice during my trip to Vegas.  Both times it took over 30 minutes to be seated, another 10 to have the order taken and another 20 to be served.  This was at 6:30 in the morning.  The food is diner food.  Nothing to write home about or make this place a destination.  I do give them kudos for some of the best orange juice, but for $4 per glass it had better be.

Ok so this place is far from inexpensive but...    From the moment you arrive you are greeted with culinary magic.  The Parmesan chunks, the excellent breads, the paper thin zucchini and mushrooms with delicious olive oil (that in itself would make a meal and are all brought to you while you decide on what you want for dinner at no extra charge).  The wine list is amazing and in a leather bound book. (They had wines for as little as $80 and as high as $29,000.  Yep it is no typo 29K for a bottle.) All the pasta is fresh, ravioli amazing, appetizers are diverse and delicious.  Everyone at the table enjoyed different items from Gnocchi to Mediterranean Sea Bass and all were amazing.  The food kept coming for over 3 hours and by the end we were too stuffed to even contemplate dessert.  If you win BIG in Vegas and are looking for an experience that will be remembered, then set aside about $400-$800 for dinner here and enjoy.

Extremely dark inside. (needed flashlights to read menus).  Rushed service and food was just average.  I'll stick with il Mulino for their mind blowing service and food.

Excellent espresso, quick service, and an excellent assortment of gelato (although I did not take a taste).  The line gets ridiculous after eight a.m. but around 6 I was able to get in line and be waited on within a few minutes.  You can have your drinks for there or to go.  I ordered a double esprsso and it was piping hot with lots of crema.  It was perfect.  Anxiously awaiting the chance to go back and sample some gelato.

One of the best deals in Vegas!  Happened upon this restaurant when I was staying in the Palazzo for a convention.  My buddy and I decided to go for their TASTE OF TABLE 10 MENU. For $45 you get four courses.  You can add the optional wine pairing for an additional $28. (Um...No brainer.)    1st course - Boston Lettuce Salad (windrose farms head lettuce - bacon - chive - buttermilk dressing - heirloom tomatoes) paired with the Banfi Chianti Classico   2nd course - SQUASH Gnudi - pecan - sage butter - romano cheese (a very well put together dish so much lighter than gnocchi that paired well with the pinot) Talbott "Logan" Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir.  3rd course - WAGYU SKIRT STEAK with potato pur√©e - spinach - red wine sauce paired with a Don Miguel Gascon Malbec.  (This dish was so luscious and melted in your mouth)  4th course - EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE with chocolate shavings, caramel sauce and whipped cream and that was paired with (I believe) a late harvest Chardonnay.  With tip and some additional wine it came out to be less than $110 per person.  As you know in Vegas this is a steal when everywhere else we had gone on the strip was much more expensive with nowhere the quality and service we received.  I'll be back next trip.  Well done!

Stayed on the 37th floor with the floor to ceiling windows(amazing views) and the magic controls by the front door and beside the bed to control the lights, blinds, sheers, etc.  The room was a suite and is very nicely appointed.  Bed is comfy with 6 pillows, bathroom was spotless and the 42" flat screen didn't hurt either.  The Encore's personnel make you feel welcome and appreciated from check in to check out.  I needed some shoes shined and called down to the Bell Desk at 5 a.m. and a person answered straight away and had someone come up to the room and pick up the shoes. When I returned the shoes were back in my room and had a shine on them like i've never seen before.  The only reason the Encore doesn't rate 5 stars is due to the expense of food within the hotel and distance from all the action on the strip.

I understand that all of these hotels feel that when you come to Vegas that you have cashed out all of your savings and are willing to spend copious amounts of money for EVERYTHING but c'mon $14 for a small bowl of wonton soup?  I received three small wontons with some fresh julienned carrots and two tiny leafs of bok choy.  Next time i'll take a cab to something better.

The moment you walk in you know this isn't your average hotel.  The open feel and modern decor greets you.  The staff all have smiles on their faces and are genuinely friendly.  Rooms are clean and the beds are super comfy. (One of the best nights sleep i've had in any hotel.)  The walls are thin, but I had the A/C fan running and it blocked out most of the noise.  The bar downstairs is fully stocked and they even have a free pool table.  They had a DJ spinning records and it gave the bar a nightclub feel.  I did not have any issue with the internet and was able to stream music and Hulu TV with no hiccup or issue.  The concept is excellent and I found myself looking for other Aloft hotels in the cities I travel to for business.  I'll be back.

We had the opportunity to come here twice in our business trip to Scottsdale.  A special shout out and thanks to Brian (executive chef) and Michele and Lindsay (the best wait staff ever!).  On the first night we came in around 10 p.m. and even though they closed at 9 they still seated us with a smile and asked us what they could make for us. (Try getting that at any restaurant these days.)  The food is amazing but the service and connection to the staff is even better.  This is truly a dining experience and not just a place to eat.  In the two nights I tried the filet (magical combo of flavors with the potatoes w/tarragon) and the rack of lamb (I uploaded a pic for your viewing pleasure).  On the second night we started with the wild mushroom flatbread (a must for the combination of mushrooms, onions, red pepper flake, balsamic, and fontina)  Brian came and sat with us as did Lindsay.  Since we had expressed a true love of wine on the first night we met, Brian brought a special bottle from his own cellar and shared it with us. (Thanks again Brian it was very nice!)  Everything here has Brian's passion for cooking and making each patron feel like a king or queen.  Michelle and Lindsay are amazing with the perfect suggestions on what should be ordered and are very attentive to your every need.  To end the night Brian broke away from the duties in the kitchen and enjoyed a cigar with us out side.  I'm already trying to map out another trip down here just to have another perfect dining experience.  Well done all!

Great thin crust pizza and a regular wine list (very good) and a break the bank reserve wine list.  Went for a Personal Pizza (12 in.) that starts at $9 and adding toppings increases the price.  Decided on a modified Margherita pizza and they do not skimp on the basil (HUGE plus!) The crust is nice and then and the pizza once ordered is delivered to your table in under ten minutes due to their ovens. The service is good as is the pizza and I think a good deal when you are in the Palazzo.

Nice to find healthy options when having a layover.  They had three ready made sandwich options that all sounded good.  I landed on a pesto, brie, sun dried tomato, and arugula sandwich.  It was perfectly seasoned with just a hint of salt and sweetness from the sun dried tomato.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I felt for the price it was an excellent way to satisfy my hunger.  I'll be back next time through the PHX airport.
