My friends and I came here on Saturday and I was really excited about it because I hadn't been to Bridgette's in so long. The night started off really well! My drinks were good, the nachos were to die for, and the karaoke was really getting going. My favorite song was being sung and I (stupidly) stood up on my chair (we do this at another karaoke bar that we frequently visit so it's a bad habit) and I was quickly told to sit down (in a very polite manner) by the manager. Naturally I sat down right away and apologized. I know she was just concerned about my safety. I had been sitting down for not even twenty seconds and I had one of my feet tucked under my bottom (I would like to stress that my bottom was still ON the chair) when another waitress named Mercedes came over pointing at me and said "sit your ASS on the chair." I was kind of taken aback. I was thinking "did I hear that right? Is this real life?" I've had interesting experiences in restaurants before but this one takes the cake. I've never witnessed anything so unprofessional in my life. She eventually came over and apologized but it was kind of forced and unauthentic. She then started talking about my friends and I in a negative manner to some friends she had there while she was still working and we were still in the building. I won't ever be back. I was really upset and, even more so, embarrassed. It ruined my whole night despite my best efforts to continue having a good time. A friend of mine was talking about wanting to have her bachelorette party there but after I told her this story she agreed that we won't be doing that.

Hands down my favorite weekend karaoke spot. The staff is fantastic and remembers our names and drink orders the minute we walk in. Very family like establishment.

I'm a fairly big fan of Padre Murphy's. I come every year for St. Patrick's Day and for most sporting events with a very large group of my friends. But tonight made me realize they are skimping on their alcoholic beverages. I ordered 7 Long Island Ice Teas during the fights. Normally that would have anyone  sleeping in a corner near the bar on the ground in any other establishment but tonight I'm just fine wishing I was a little more buzzed. Extremely disappointed that I spent so much money and did not get my money's worth. I will be watching my sporting events in other venues who don't try to save a few dollars by diluting their beverages.

The food is delicious and my margarita was to die for. But the service was pretty rough. Our waitress checked on us three times. Once to take drink orders, once to take our order, and once to bring us a pitcher of water. Between 7 of us we went through that pitcher rather quickly and then we didn't see our waitress for at least 40 minutes. I had to walk to the bar myself to get our check. If it was busy I could totally understand this but it was 3 o'clock on a week day and there were maybe 4 other people there sitting at the bar. I would say the main downfall is that the servers aren't very interested in helping their guests but like I said the food and drink is really good!

I eat here every Saturday because it's close to where I work and I can generally get in and out fairly quickly. That's thanks in large part to the staff that's there on Saturday afternoons. They know I only get 20-30 minutes to get in and out of there so if there's a really long line they make my order the minute they see me walk in (it's always the same) and ring it up when there's a break in the line. They also always ask me how my day is going and how busy the salon is. I really feel welcomed when I come in here and I very much appreciate it.

I came here with a moderate case of shingles and was really nervous about it because I couldn't get there until an hour before they closed and thought for sure that they would be a little rude for coming in so late. NOT the case. I want to give them 10 stars! I had the most pleasant experience I've ever had in an urgent care (and I go fairly often since I work with kids who love to share their germs). DR. Neely was amazing and quick and efficient. The receptionist and nurse were equally as friendly. And they had the medications I needed on hand and only $15 a bottle. I will forever only use this urgent care no matter where I live in the valley. I highly recommend you pay them a visit. Not to mention it was very clean and nice.

I'm updating my previous review after going for my second time today. Still same great and amazing care. I couldn't breathe when I got in and they spent over an hour with me giving breathing treatments and medication to help open up my airways. They also got me in pretty quick but that could be a combination of the fact that it was in the middle of a Tuesday and they could probably hear my god awful cough in the waiting room all the way in the back. One of the docs that helped me even postponed his lunch to help me. Still my number one urgent care!

I've been here four time since it opened. The food is fantastic but that's about it. The customer service is appalling.
