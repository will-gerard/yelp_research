Avoid avoid avoid. What is this place Japanese? Italian? Do they know who they are? We ordered seaweed salad - I think my frys has better salad for $2; my daughter ordered California rolls - very average; the pad Thai was as bland as I have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor - no wonder they offer  sauce. Kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star.

I have been a patient of Dr Akerson for many years and over this time he has helped relieve pain from running and sports.  I liked him because he is not quick to x-ray and takes a holistic approach by using manipulation and massage to help the problem. I did like him......until my most recent experience......  I went to see him as I was experiencing sciatic, periformis and ITB issues. The pain was keeping me up at night. I was excited to get to the bottom of it and resolve the issue.  I travel 45 minutes from North Scottsdale to his office in Ahwatukee. My appointment was at 11am. I arrived at 10.55 and was kept waiting until 11.20 when he came in. He briefly asked what the issue was and adjusted my spine. I was advised to come back the following week if the issue was not solved. Yeah right....Shlepp another 45 minutes for a 5 minute consult (not to mention the 20 minute wait)...I don't think so.  He did not have any further advise and completely ignored the problem I was trying to explain.   I was done and out the door by 11.25...seriously...an hour and a half dive and $45 for a 5 minute adjustment. He was obviously super busy that day as it was right before the PF changes marathon, but even a general practitioners office spends 15 minutes with you.  What a waste of time and money. My leg issue was not addressed and I was clearly disappointed. Will be searching for a replacement chiropractor closer to home.

Yes, we schlep down here almost monthly for a Vietnamese fix  Yes, we order by numbers - 29, 31 etc... Yes we do get wild once in a while and order the salt and pepper squid (delicious). Yes, its open all day so if you are channeling your inner nana, you can stop by for dinner at 3pm. No, It's not 5 star No, you will not get clothe napkins No, alcohol is not served  But......  The service is exceptionally fast and this place is inexpensive. The Vietnamese coffee will keep you buzzing for the better part of your day.  So if you are after a quick, inexpensive, Vietnamese meal..I would recommend Saigon Pho

I have been seeing doctor Bomer and the aestetician Emily for almost 3 years. I cannot speak highly enough about both Dr Bomer and Emily. I look younger now than I did 10 years ago and I have regained all the confidence I lost from years of sun damage stress and sleep deprivation (hello two babies that would not sleep and a very busy home business). Dr Bomer will not allow you to look like you have been swept thru a wind tunnel or frozen in time. She knows exactly where to place product to make your look 100% natural. Ahhh Emily ...what can I say about that wonderful, caring gal. My skin has NEVER looked better and she is honest as the day is young. I have had IPL, dermaplane and microdermabration and have a perfect experience with all three. I have put my face in her hands for three years and would NEVER stray. Go see her...you won't regret it.

Laura is such a pro! Sweet and easy to get along with. Very professional.  I have tried other places and they either want to sell you all the accessories to keep your brows looking perfect or they over or under pluck. Sincing going to the brow lady I have had people actually compliment me on the shape of my brows! This place is very clean and appointments are quick and easy. It takes just 15 minutes to whip my unruley european brows into shape and lasts 4 weeks. So convenient. I'm so glad I found them.

Laura has now moved to the wind and water spa in Scottsdale. She is no longer (to my dismay) at the The brow lady. I went back to the brow lady and found this out the hard way. They did an "ok" job, but it wasnt Laura!!!

Went for the first time today and had the asian vegetable sandwich. The bread is fresh baked on site. Very european. Crunchy freshness on the outside and fluffy white on the inside. The kimchi was homemade and combined with jalepenos and crunchy vermacelli noodles. AMAZING. I also tried a bite of the pork - delicious!!!! Will definitely be back for the anchovie sandwich. I washed it down with the sweet goodness of vietnamese coffee.

Had such a fantastic experience today with Brittney Larson. I had been growing out my roots and just wanted a few highlights to break up the dark versus light look I was rocking. She listened to me carefully and then pulled out the different colored hair swatches so that together we could pick the "goldilocks color...not too dark....not too light.....but just right". She explained everything she was doing (whisper thin highlights) and walked me through the process. Needless to say, I was more than thrilled with the result. This girl is a gem.

Very easy to work with. Calls if he is running late or early. More than I have paid in the past for carpet cleaning, but the best work I have ever seen! My carpets were trashed by pets and kids and after Georges' visit, they look brand new. So worth every penny. 10% discount for yelpers.  Very professional - would definitely recommend paradise carpet cleaning.

Looking for a trail run of medium difficulty - look no further. Easy parking at Shea and 40th street, trail 100 is the perfect "quick 30" minute run. Lovely undulating hills and only a few mountain bikers to dodge, this is my "go to" running trail in the cooler months. Hint: Do not go off the trail...the cholla bite :)

ok, ok...so for the first 30 minutes we had fun with the name of this restaurant...but then we simmered down and got down to some serious eating business. We went with another couple on a Saturday night at 6pm. Ambiance - The place was packed with a huge party, but that just made the atmosphere fun! There was background music and a couple belly dancers.....We were seated in a private booth and could engage in conversation with no problems. I grew up in Australia with Lebanese family friends and was privy to delight in authentic Lebanese food at family events,  so I am familiar with the real deal. Having lived in Arizona for 15 years, I crave traditional ethnic food. This place did not disappoint; In fact at times I was rendered speechless. I ordered the vegetarian platter - baba ganoush (amazing and not bitter at all), hummus (thick and creamy), tabouleh (light and not too garlicky) and the most delicious light and soft dolmas I have ever had. I also ordered a side of kibbe which were tasty little morsels, but needed a little more zing. The accompanying yoghurt dressing was delicious. My friends had a the lentle soup and chicken shishkabob and said both were amazing. We are currently planning a return visit with the kids.....  oh and the dipping bread is warm and light...fresh out of the oven  Enjoy!

I wish there were 6 stars for this place. I have been here a few times and think the burgers and fries are world class, but I had to bring my parents who have eaten burgers around the world to make sure I wasn't blowing smoke. Usually a health food freak, it takes a special burger to bring me to the dark side. The garage burger has all the things to make you go "hmm" in a good way - angus beef (not too fatty), cheese of choice, smoked apple bacon, caramelized onions and a couple of ancillary vegetables (lettuce, tomato). I could sit and eat a whole container of the horseradish pickles without batting an eyelash. Running a very close second is their American burger. Usually, if I am obsessing over the burger, the fries will not get my attention, but both their waffle fries and brew fries have crack appeal. The chipotle mayo the brew fries are served with is the icing on the cake.  Happy hour has some interesting choices, shrimp kabobs and devilled eggs, but I would recommend paying the extra for the burgers! Even if it means you have to run and extra mile the next day :)))

I have tried so hard to support this place, but honestly its not working for me. The owner has some real attitude and its challenging to support. Once I was in there and she started to push my table back telling me rudely I needed to "move in" to make room for others. Another time , I received the incorrect drink order and she told me it was because I ordered it wrong. I was in yesterday and ordered my kids the nutella mocha....the barrista was so swamped filling both in house and drive through orders that she forgot entirely to put the "nutella" in their drinks. Zero consistency here.  Don't even bother to order the juice smoothy, its just Costco juice blended over ice. Erroneously they list all of the ingredients in the Costco juice...making you think you are getting actual vegetables....32nd st caf√©..calling you out on this one.  The owner also likes to rave about how much money she is making, so clearly, short changing customers is the way to go.

I have a few friends that shopped here for all their furniture needs for their first baby. I like to support local stores and not the mass chains.  I came in looking for a baby gift for a friend and was pleasantly surprised.   Loads on offer - from diaper bags, plush toys, layette and all at different price points.  I luckily found a few items to gift for the baby shower , thanks to the sales staff that asked plenty of questions and worked within my budget to find the perfect gift.  Highly recommend this place for all your baby and toddler needs.

I purchased a groupon some time ago for Kimberleys and have been seeing her ever since. Not only is she a kind sweet person, but her devotion to a healthy lifestyle is inspiring. My skin also feels AMAZING after a facial from Kimberley. Talented Lady!

I followed Jacqueline Weinstein over from another salon...and wanted to give her a shout out. Jacqui has been doing my extensions for several years now and is amazing. I have gone from super blonde, to "Bronde" and we change up the extensions accordingly. Her prices are reasonable and she is an expert in color matching.  The hair is really good quality. Jacqui cuts it in such a way that it blends with your natural hair. Nobody ever suspects that I have extensions.

I have now tried 3 yoga classes at Studio north yoga. Each time with a different instructor. As a busy women - with  two jobs, two kids, house etc...I find it almost imossible to turn inwards and tune out while at the same time, know I am working my body. I have found solace in studio North. First class experienced instructors, yogini atmosphere, and relaxed disposition. The instructoars cater to all levels from beginner to advanced and truly know their stuff. Who knew that having a chime in my ear during savasana with vibrations could actually be a spiritual experience. I dont feel like I am working out, and yet, the perspiration and next day aches portray a differnt story.

Basically this place ruined my self esteem and cost me $1500. I had filler injected elsewhere two weeks prior and the micro needling professional lied and said that the micro needling assists the filler. What happened in fact was it caused the filler to be metabolized so basically I wasted all my money . The groupon is for $90, but then they tell you the only way to make the treatment affective is to spend $60 extra on a collagen infusion. They then told me during treatment that they would "give me something to help with the healing"; I was thinking samples etc...no, that something was a $120 container of collagen waiting for me at checkout for purchase. My face looks so much worse since coming here, I have spent even more money trying to reverse the damage.

I just had a dermaplane and facial from Laura at Elegant Rebel. She definitely goes above and beyond. I have had dermaplaning before but Laura really stood out. She is so meticulous and adds a light peel and facial.  My skin looks and feels amazing.  She is extremely knowledgeable and very sweet.  I would highly recommend Laura.
