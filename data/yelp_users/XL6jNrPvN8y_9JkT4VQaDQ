I took my lunch date to this place since she haven't date dim sum in AZ before. This was the closest location in the west side.  When we get there, the parking and restaurant were packed. A good indicator I think.  Got my table relatively quicky.  We ordered many various dishes from sticky rice to shumai. It was pretty good.  My date were looking for some BBQ chicken feet and it was not available. A little bummed but it did not ruin the experience.  The only negative thing I can gripe about were the noodle. It simply sucked. We barely touched it. It was a little wasteful. Something learned....we will not order noodles again...  Overall, I can't wait to bring here again

I brought my date to this restaurant because of her previous experience with their green curry. We ordered the green curry and the chicken basil with a sticky on the side. Although the green curry and chicken basil was delicious, the sticky was rock solid. As far I can remember, sticky rice were not suppose to be like rocks.  Furthermore, we ordered the mango sticky rice dessert. That too was a big disappointment. It was sad when my date stated that she can make better product that Yupha.  Lastly, the service was sub-par when it gets busy. We tried numerous times flagging a helper for addition rice. I think the service is good when it isn't busy.   Although this restaurant is close to my house, I don't think I will visit this place much...unless I crave some green curry....

We ordered the best deal meal package....basically a 4 entre meal.  The servers started to talk crap about us in Chinese thinking that my gf and I do not understand Mandarin or Cantonese. Well...we do! Anyways, my gf got upset and ruined my dinner. Horrible.   With that said, please don't talk crap about your customers in front of them!!!

Ok. After communicating with management and cleared the air, I've returned to the restaurant and only order to go. We will slowly get re accustomed to their service.  The food is still fantastic.  Will return again.

This place sucks ass.  My girlfriend and I got seated and apparently they forgot about us as we sat for 15mins without an inquiry about the water.  We left and I started this Yelp.  Stay away!

I've been back a couple of times since the initial visit. The service has definitely improved. The food is actually pretty decent. I usually order the Bun Bo Hue. It is a tad oily but overall full of favor.  However, in my last visit, I noticed that they changed their serving bowls. They claim it is better to "hold the heat". In my opinion, it just looks smaller. I believe it is smaller because my gf were able to finish her meal...which is rare.  Now....I am deciding if I should return since the portion to cost ratio is no longer fair...

Let's talk about the positive - The food is decent. Most of the combination plates are decently priced and the portions are good. Look out for their giant sized onion cuts. They don't believe smaller portion cuts. Overall, the taste is good.   The bad - This happened to me numerous times. Since I am a English dominate Asian guy, I find their service appalling. There have been a few times where I don't get served the menu. Those times, I simply walked out.  As for the servers, if you are not a Chinese speaking customer, they simply ignore you. I noticed that many of the servers take their time talking to other patrons while I am left alone.   This place serves a niche but their service quality should be better for everyone...

This place is great. The people courtious and the food is tasty. Glad I took the trip.  The mix of Greek and Vietnamese is a great combo.  I RECOMMEND the gyro spring roll. YUM!

My gf and I had the Groupon for this place. It was mistake. Simple as that.  The prices are slightly more expensive than normal.  We ordered 3 items. The mango curry (3of 5 hot scale), larb (3of 5 hot scale), and crispy noodle (2of 5 hot scale). The crispy noodle were so spicy that my gf and I couldn't even eat it. We ask to be remade and the cook stated that we should have ordered less spicy. Note that we finished the mango curry and larb which is suppose to be hotter.  Of course, I inquired about extra rice....which is additional cost.  Lastly, knowing that I was quite upset, they try to give me coconut ice cream. It turns out to be vanilla ice cream.   I think this restaurant needs improvement in their customer service. The food was decent. Decor is not pretty. Meh!

Had another AC guy come in for a tune up. They ended claiming I need a freon fill up and require a service call. What suppose to be a $40 turned to a $450 quote.  I respectfully declined and found Dawn til Dusk which has a great review.  30 minutes later, Eric came and inspected my unit. ZERO issues. He did a tune up and left without any up sell. The 1st guy was trying to pull a fast one. Glad to have found this company.  Will us them going forward.  Thank you!!

I have a 2001 740il. I went to BMW to replace my tranny fill plug. It was stripped. I figured I went to the best/high quality because I didn't want any mistakes. Everything went smoothly until a week later when I had my mechanic lift the car to do a tranny job.  Apparently, BMW forgot to secure the bracket holding my exhaust pipes. There were only 1 loose bolt left hanging. I took a couple of pics.  That very day (Saturday), I went to BMW to complain that I paid for an incomplete job. A manager replied the next day and I showed him the pictures. He apologizes but didn't provide a resolution.  If the exhaust pipe dropped, it would have caused massive damage to my car and they realize the gravity of their errors.  They do not take care of customers who has older BMWs. I bet if I had a new BMW, I would be taken care of....

You really shouldn't go anywhere else for water heater replacement. I used him for my mom's place and today, mine decided to crap out on me.  I forgot his contact info and by luck, I called him through Yelp. Came right away on a Sunday. Since I am a repeat customer and paid cash, got a nice discount.  Jim was very communicative and his job was excellent. I am going to refer his services going forward. Thanks again.

Isaac with his son in law arrived on time. He called per my request upon arrival. He promptly did the work. Took care of my leaking shower. Absolutely alleviated my stress due to the old unit.  The job was more difficult than anticipated but the price was fair. Great to work with.  Thanks guys!

This place is simply....disappointing.  As I sat down, this place has absolutely no "Vietnamese" or "Asian" attributes. It is simply an American sports bar.  Nevertheless, I ordered the Stir Fry. Apparently, they forgot how to add other sauces other than the chilli peppers. It was so hot that there were not other flavors. It is gross. I am still recovering from this... If you want a sport bar, this is a good place but anything else is a joke.   Avoid...

I went to Dan to do a job for my gf Camry. After chatting a few moments, he recommended that I take the car to the dealership for replacement since it should have a lifetime warranty. It is refreshing and money saving to get this advice. It is rare for this info and I would definitely recommend him due to his honesty. Although I didn't get his service but I felt his honesty won me over.  Thanks again Dan!!!

This is an addictive place. Aside from their great customer service, their product is simply excellent. I am big fan of their red bean smoothie, Vietnamese coffee, and their snow. Now, I have a new addiction. I highly recommend the mocha smoothie.  Not the healthiest thing in the world though.   Of course....it doesn't hurt with all the eye candy either.

Love my 2 storage rack!  At first, I was hesitant about the quality, but after a few boxes later, my mind is at ease.  Can't be the price! Thanks.

I ordered a special combination and received a free drink. It was a good start. I waited for 20 minutes to receive my sandwich. Frustrated, I inquired about my order. Apparently, a couple of customer after me ordered a set of sandwiches and decides to push my to the back. Not a very good customer service.  Finally, after 30 minutes I received the sandwich and surprised by the lack of substance in the filling.  My first visit sucks!   However, I will visit them again to give them another opportunity.

I had the Entertainment coupon and had to try their dinners. It was amazing. The garlic naan was good and not dried up like others.  The lunch buffet was tasty without overly pricey.   Good place for Indian food.

As a Malaysian, I really enjoyed this place. Reminds me of my home country. The food is great.  The people are friendly. It is my go-to place when I crave some Malaysian food.  I recommend the Laksa, Nasi Lemak, Cha Qeuy Teau, Ice Kacang, well....everything....haha.   Oh yea...the roti canai.   Bring the Satey!!!
