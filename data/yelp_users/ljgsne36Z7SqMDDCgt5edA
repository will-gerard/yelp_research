Fantastic, personal service company that knows their stuff! They have replaced several windshields (I'm a rock magnet). They handled everything and even initiated the claim for me, stayed on the phone with me with the insurance company and literally took care of everything.  Can't say enough good about these guys. So refreshing to have a good glass company you can trust who is both honest and professional. Will use again and again!

This isn't a 5-star restaurant by any means but definitely best bang for the buck out there. Of course you're limited by your (bad) pizza ordering habits and the pizza is a good as your combinations. A medium BBQ chicken pizza with roasted red peppers, Hawaiian Volcano and must-have Hot Buffalo Specialty chicken for $6 each!? Yeessss!  I've not been Domino's biggest fan in the past but their new taste is genuinely the best in the bargain pizza biz and they have consistently over the past year got each and every order correct and on-time (many times slightly early).  Carryout is the best option as they have everything ready w/i 10 or 12 minutes and the staff in-store are fantastic. Save yourself the money for delivery and leave a small tip instead :-) The only thing that would be better is if I knew someone that worked there so I could eat this pizza (and their specialty chicken) for free!

I REALLY want to recommend this place. If you could figure out a way to just get their delicious food with no issues or dealings with the ownership, I say go for it. However, they happen to have the *worst* service I have ever seen. While the servers themselves have always treated me with respect and have been quick to get the right food, the owner is definitely *not* customer-minded.  I regularly go here with my brother for lunch and on occasion with my wife. There have been a few occasions -- out of 20+ visits to this place -- where there was some kind of problem and we were treated with complete disrespect.  Case in point: today, my brother took someone out here for their birthday. As he went to eat his last piece of sushi, he found a big, long jet-black hair. His server was there and he politely asked for a replacement piece. She agreed and apologetically left him. After several minutes, my brother threw in some money in the tip jar and noticed his server near the back by -- presumably -- the owner.  He mentioned the piece he was waiting for and the server said she wouldn't be able to replace it. Surprised, he tried appealing to the owner and she spat back: "You can't eat your food and then ask me to replace it". An argument ensued where he defended his right to hair-free sushi and told her that the server saw it (removed the hair for him... a health-code violation perhaps?). The owner then yelled at the server for "not telling [her]" to which the server responded "well it could have been his hair"!  This continued while in front of the birthday guest as they flat-out refused to replace the piece the server took with something fresh (and hair-free). I have to say I was completely floored that this kind of experience exists anywhere in this country with litigation, health departments and in the online world we live in.  Clearly this is ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS customer service (this wasn't the first time). They are the only Japanese/sushi restaurant in town and again the food is -- for the price -- absolutely fantastic. However, until they up their service game, I can't recommend the place. These guys owe my brother big. I've also recommended he put in a complaint with the local health department.

The novelty of eating during your movie quickly wears out due to the horrific customer service. I'm not sure if it's adequately staffed or what but after finally taking my order 40 minutes into the film, it took them another 50 minutes to bring me my food: a simple order of buffalo wings!  If you're going to the movies here and need to eat out, hit something in town first or the 347 Grill (if popcorn or icecream won't do the trick, that is).

Best pho I've had in Arizona. The broth is light and never oily and though the price is a little bit higher than most for pho, the extra noodle bowl is the best value (and who doesn't love extra pho to take home for later?).  Service is excellent and always quiet for lunch. I've tried about half of the side dishes and loved them all (the sauces are amazing!). I've taken non-pho-fans here before and seems to be the only place that offers quite a bit for the uninitiated.
