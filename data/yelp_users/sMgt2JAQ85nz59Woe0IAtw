I've loved nearly every zoo I've been to in my life (which is basically limited to the Oregon Zoo in Portland and Zoo Boise), but the Phoenix Zoo is easily the most kid-friendly. We really enjoy it here. If you've got a kid over one year old, I strongly suggest getting a membership. It'll keep you busy in spring and autumn.

SunUp makes some decent brews, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. Here's what we had:  Ahi Sliders: Bland coleslaw and tuna were overpowered by the oversized and mediocre bun.  Shrimp tacos: Way too salty and overcooked. Fortunately, there were only two shrimp per taco, so the disappointment at how they tasted was mitigating by the sheer lack of content.  Macaroni & Cheese: Not bad, but it's mac & cheese.  The service was great and there's plenty of space, but there's really no reason to eat here, and, in my opinion, there are better places to get beer.

Arggggh! This place had so much potential: great beer list, solid design and decor, and not too far from our house.  Unfortunately, they don't have great sushi. They don't even have good enough sushi to bring me back despite the beer list. The search for decent, reasonably priced sushi continues...

I'm thrilled people love this place as much as I do. I can't stand Home Depot or Lowe's (which is too far away anyway). Ace is right down the road and has terrific service. Every so often, I'll hit up a big box store for things like wider fixture selections, but I usually leave unimpressed. It may not quite be mom-and-pop, but Howard's Ace is close. I'm not handy in the least, but this is a place I weirdly enjoy going.

I'm no expert on Greek food, but as far as I'm concerned Cyprus Grill does it as well as anyone. The Spartan Club (a massive pita sandwich stacked with gyro toppings, grilled chicken, lamb and hot sauce) is one of those dishes I crave, even when i can't finish it all. The service is always terrific, and it's located right by Trader Joe's, so you can grab some good, cheap bottles of wine while you're there.

We used to go to Taylor Cafe all the time, but haven't been in a while.  Man, what a difference- and not in a good way.  It is unseasonably cool in Phoenix and Vincent's isn't having their brunch experience, so we decided to go back to Taylor Cafe.  There were several less than pleasant surprises.  First off, they no longer have a liquor license and thus no Mimosas or Bloody Marys.  That was a minor issue for us, but worth mentioning on a Saturday morning brunch.  I ordered a cup of coffee, some scrambled eggs with cheese for my hungry toddler, and we looked at the menu.    It seemed to have gotten much larger and there were some new interesting items.  I loved the eggs benedict before, and ordered it again.  My husband ordered the crepes.  We anticipated our meals.  My daughter's eggs came out almost within seconds.  Shocked, I saw it wasn't just eggs, but hashbrowns and fruit.  It was also NOT warm.  That surprise was a $9 meal.  While waiting for our meal, I drank most of my coffee.  The server asked if I'd like more coffee to heat up my cup.  He took my cup, which I though was odd, and brought it back with warm, steaming coffee.  Yay!  Upon getting the bill, I learned there was no such things as refills and I was charged for a second cup.    Lastly, our food was delivered.  My eggs benedict was not warm...again!  What is with cool food?  There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce, and honestly, it just wasn't that tasty.  My husband thought his crepes were just ok- not bad, but not flavorful.  Our last surprise:  when the bill arrived and we spent $45 on at best a mediocre breakfast, we were less than pleased.  The only bright spot- our server was friendly and did his best.    We will not go back.  This was just one disappointment after another.

Since we moved to Phoenix from Portland three years ago, the Arizona craft beer scene has blown up a great deal. While the state still lags behind its other western states in the local brewery department, the distribution and availability of excellent beers seems to expand weekly.  It's hard to think of a more central hub to that movement than Papago Brewing, a simple pub with a exceptional smattering of craft beers on tap and a bank of refrigerators stacked with the best bottled beer Arizona distributors have to offer. Along with Sun Devil Liquors and Topps, this is where Arizona's beer lovers congregate.  And the food's not bad either. Especially the pizza.  I saw the new expansion for the first time last night, and it seems a little incongruous and bright, but more seating is more seating, and I can't complain about that. Maybe it's the acoustics in the new room, but it was LOUD in there.  Fortunately, great beer and the company of beer lovers makes up for it.

How could Pizzeria Bianco have 4 stars? It's widely regarded as the best pizza place in the freaking country.  I don't get Yelp sometimes.

I'm not sure I can put Cibo on par with Pizzeria Bianco. I just can't.  It's pretty close, though. And when you factor in wait times (15 minutes on a First Friday night at 7pm), parking (much better, being on the west side of downtown), and leftovers (the pizza crust holds up remarkably well under microwaving), it's really no question.  We started with the burrata, and I really can't recommend this enough: two mountains of creamy, fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto that melts in your mouth, and toasted bread that's just soft enough to keep from dicing the roof of your mouth. The only problem was, by the end of it (and we scraped every bit of cheese up) we were hardly hungry. Between the two pizzas we ordered between my wife, me, and our daughter, we finished less than half. From now on, we'll go with the burrata, and split a pie...though then we'd miss out on the leftovers. I'll have to rethink this.  A few minor quibbles: it'd be nice of the beers were on tap. My Lagunitas IPA wasn't quite cold enough. Also, the main entrance is a tight fit, but it's worth it for the ambiance, I think.  Beyond that, though, everything about Cibo, from the food to the charming owners, was exceptional. I only half-jested that I'd like to go back today.

I'm a Portlander, and of every single place in Phoenix, nowhere feels more like Portland than Shady's.  This is good and bad. Come in on a weeknight, and it's like the PDX dives we used to hit in the early '00s, except everyone just kept aging and drinking. As I was texting this to my friend the other day, I followed it up with, "I mean, 'Amelie' is playing on the TVs right now. 'Amelie'." Another downside: the beer selection, while it's gotten better in my four years here, still kind of sucks. Then again, if they had 12 taps and a bunch of imperial IPAs and stouts, it wouldn't be Shady's, would it?  And yet, as I said before, it feels like home. It's only a few blocks away, and I love it.

The only drag about LGO is the crush of people and the lack of parking. Otherwise, there's little not to like about this place.  Beyond the entire LGO experience, the Pizzeria's pies are astounding. They may not be Bianco level, but the sourdough crust is enough to set them apart and wait is rarely more than 10 minutes, even with pickup. We particularly love the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza (add Italian sausage for richer flavor). The burgers are amazing, too. Some of the best in the city.  Oh, and the white sangria. Get that. Beer-wise, the selection is limited.  Service is typically excellent, though sometimes there's a wait for a table. I recommend getting there sooner rather than later so you can find a seat and the buzz from the sangria can last the rest of the evening.

Oh, lordy, this place was delicious. Just a cornucopia of scrumptious flavors. I had the braised short rib, green beans and chipotle mashed potatoes, and everything was insanely tasty.  The layout is odd (we were in some sort of disconnected annex that was loud enough with three couples sitting in it...can't imagine what it's like when full), and it's pricey.  The mojitos are amazing, but the Yelp special is really misleading. It says:  "Mention YELP and receive one free mojito with each entree purchased at the Bistro, CANNOT be combined with any offer.. Who wants mint?"  Except apparently you have to eat there three times to activate the whole free mojito thing. That doesn't sound right, does it?  Also, we had a great server, but there was another lady there that was EXTREMELY boisterous. Like, slightly obnoxiously so. I'd rather have her than a bad server any time, but she'd be a bit much after a while.

The first time I visited Sprouts nearly three years ago, I felt like home. We live right inbetween Fry's, Safeway, Trader Joe's and Sprouts, but if I can possibly find something at Sprouts, it's my first pick.   Over time, we've developed a nice relationship with most of the tellers. The prices on produce and meat are pretty terrific, and the beer selection improved considerably about two years ago. It's not a great place for wine, and I have to visit more popular supermarkets like Fry's for liquor and, say, tin foil. I guess you can't have everything, but what Sprouts does, they do well.  And yeah, like ashley d. said below, $2.99 deli sandwiches. I don't think that pricing exists anywhere anymore. GOOOOO SPROUTS!  (Also, say hello to Stephanie...she's my daughter's favorite cashier.)

Bertha's is awesome. Especially...ESPECIALLY...those little cookies they give you with every sandwich. Holy moley.  Oh, and I think they changed some of the bread on the sandwiches, but it's for the better. I salute you for your bread change, Bertha's!

Beer-wise, I still prefer Papago Brewing and Topps. But the ambiance was pretty delightful, the service was great (it helps to have a cute kid), and the pizza was shockingly good.  That's not hyperbole. I mean, we're not talking Pizzeria Bianco here - deep dish is the focus - but we were stunned at the depth, complexity and deliciousness of the California Carver. It's not often you come across innovation in the world of pizza, but this was really phenomenal.

Hazelwood's is dark and dingy, and the clientele can be a little sad. It's a dive. That's just what it is.  But Hazelwood's has a special place in my heart for two reasons:  1) You can get nearly ANY game here, and enough TVs that you can usually get audio. It may not be as posh as Zipp's, and the wings might not be as good, but if you want to watch a game, Hazelwood's is the place. I used to watch nearly every Trail Blazers game here before I had a kid.  2) They have Big Sky IPA on draft, one of the finest standard IPAs in America, and a rare find anywhere.  Oh, and there's a pretty good trivia game, too.

Roka Akor features top-quality sushi, outstanding service, and some interesting cocktail all wrapped in a tastefully appointed, airy dining room.  I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars, since I generally feel a little ripped off by the portion size and the bill tipping over $100 for my wife and I even at happy hour, but I realize that's what Roka Akor is. It's not somewhere you stop in for your monthly sushi unless you're Warren Buffett or something (who, I assume, prefers beef). Roka Akor has to feature the best fish in Arizona...I just wish there was more of it.  Oh, and the Roasted Duck with kimchee for $6...(kisses fingertips)...a superb value. GET IT. The butterfish, too. At least once.

Rum Bar (and it's adjacent restaurant, The Breadfruit) is awesome. Just spectacular Jamaican food. The scallops were delectable, the jerk chicken was delightfully spicy, and the cocktails were fantastic. Service was great, too. I recommend sitting at the bar...you might luck into some free rum tastings like we did.

Best Indian food in the Valley as far as I'm concerned. The service has always been beyond terrific and the food is awesome. I really can't say anything bad about The Dhaba.  (Well, once the rice was overcooked, but it was just once.)  It's also a great place for families...they always treat our daughter like a grandkid when we're there.

Indulge is clearly trying. They have great service and decent ambiance. But damned if those burgers aren't mediocre.  Considering that the only places that open in the Valley anymore are gourmet burger joints or wood-fired pizza kitchens, you've gotta do something to stand out. Indulge's attempt is the Vesuvius Volcanic, a grand name for some melted cheese inside a beef patty. Based on the description and safety warnings, I thought I'd get blasted with molten cheese when i cut into the thing, but it just oozed out. And yes, I realize that could be mistake for euphemism.  I ended up eating it with a fork, which was not all that fun.  (Note to every burger/wood-fired pizza joint in the region: Shocktop and Landshark are NOT microbrews, no matter what Peter King says.)

Wouldn't you think a 2.5 star rating would scare me off? It was too late. I was in line, and my wife loves fish and chips, and this is a Phoenix institution, right?  "Man, what if this place is great?" I asked my wife as we waited in the drive-thru line. "We'll really kick ourselves for missing out these last few years."  Instead, we kicked ourselves for going out at all. You know the fish and chips you'd get at a British pub? These are not those fish and chips. These are essentially larger, perfectly-rectangular fish sticks. I won't even get into how they tasted. Just heed Lisa C. and A F. and all the other 1 star reviews below. Pete's is NOT worth it. It's not. It's one of my regrets in life that I didn't listen to Yelp.

This is the place for grass-fed beef and top-notch pork. Oh, and lamb, too...that's their new thing. The Meat Shop is outstanding. They've got reasonable prices (though I strongly recommend visiting for the weekly specials), high quality, and spectacular customer service every time I've ever been in, which is quite often. This is the place for meat.

While it's less than a mile away, my first visit to Teakwood's was via an expiring Groupon, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Outside of the Four Peaks taps (one is rotating, which made me very happy), the beer selection is pretty sports bar bland. The food is solid. The service is solid.  What's strange about Teakwoods is the ambiance. At one end, a dreadlocked singer-songwriter was opening for another folky act with an Americana-tinged hipster-y crowd looking on. The music was surprisingly good. Around the bar, there were some gentlemen who appeared addicted to growth hormone and mixed martial arts. At the other end, around the televisions and booths, there was a random assortment of patrons, from families to people just hanging out with a beer and generally watching TV or playing bar trivia. It was probably the oddest mix of customers I'd ever seen in one bar, but I liked it. I really did.  I'll have to run through some of the other entrees and appetizers to get a full grasp of the menu, but Teakwoods has a weird appeal, and I think it'll replace Half Moon as my go-to walking distance sports bar.

There's plenty of potential here, and the $2 mimosas on the weekends are pretty awesome.  But we waited around 45 minutes for our food. My dish arrived tepid. The Hangover Hash was disappointing, but my wife's Island Eggs Benedict was terrific, with rich and smoky ham. I eat a lot of ham, and Hula's ham made me take a step back. Maybe the late service should be chalked up to a rush or an anomaly, but our server didn't seem particularly aware of how long it was taking, and also didn't seem interested in checking in on us.  ADDENDUM: Hula's owner reached out to apologize for our lack of service that day, assuring me they were still working out a few logistical issues. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I'm aware how those things often spiral out of control of the staff. I've waited far longer at places, and part of this review stemmed from the fact our 16 month old daughter was with us, tired and cranky.  The truth is, we loved the ambiance and prices. If the food had come quicker, we would've been pleased with the service (we could've had more check-ins, however). I should've emphasized the potential...when the logistics are ironed out, this will be one of the best brunches in Phoenix. As-is, it's really good. (If you don't have a toddler who hasn't napped, that is.)

I'd really love to support the little mom and pop neighborhood beer and wine shop (I guess that would Sportsman's?) but it's kind of hard when they charge a lot and have a pretty mediocre beer selection. Then Total Wine opened up a location at 16th and Camelback, and I haven't been back to Sportsman's since.  Total Wine is sort of like Target to BevMo's Walmart. The design is nicer, and in my opinion the selection is better. The beer aisle is long and glorious. They've got nearly everything distributed in the Phoenix area, a selection which has exploded since we moved here three years ago. I used to have to drive out to Sun Devil Liquor in Mesa to find a decent beer selection. Now it's just a mile away. When I saw the "Coming Soon: Total Wine" sign a couple years ago, I let out a yelp of gladness. Good riddance, Circuit City.  There are only two problems with Total Wine:  1) I still far prefer Trader Joe's when it comes to decently-priced, drinkable wine. Total Wine should add an under $10 selection culled from their wine expert's favorites. The last $6 bottle we grabbed from TW was, frankly, pretty awful. We didn't even finish it, which takes a lot in our household. (To be fair, it was a Pinot Noir, and $6 is unspeakably cheap when it comes to Pinots. We should've known.)  2) There is one employee, a middle aged woman, who is really, really rude, and has been in every exchange we've ever had with her, even if it was watching her deal with another customer. After about the 7th or 8th time of dealing with her weird power trips, we complained to the manager. Everyone else at this location is excellent, so just hope you don't get her.

What can you say? It's In-N-Out. It's bound to be good. I'd say this one was as good as any other. It particularly hit the spot that day, but I think it was more because I was hungry.  I will say this about the location: it's a great stop on the way to Sedona/Flagstaff or anywhere else north.

I don't get the fervor over this place. Our neighbors seem to like it a great deal, and we've given it 3-4 shots, but I've been disappointed with the food every single time. It's not often I'm disappointed by burgers.  Price points are nice, I suppose, but I think you'd be better off driving to In'n'Out or paying more at Zinburger, which is only about a mile away.

I'm not entirely sure why, but this Zinburger location is just tremendous. It's pricey for a straight burger, but I'd far prefer paying $10 for a Samburger than $5-$6 at Smashburger, or even Delux for that matter.  Believe me, it doesn't make me happy backing the Fox Restaurant empire, but the quality of the burgers/shakes/salads at this place are undeniable.  Pass on the chicken sandwiches, though. They're mediocre at best.

A few weeks ago, after many, many months of passing Maui Dog on Indian School and thinking, "What the hell is that place?", I decided to check out their menu online.  It was interesting. Interesting enough that I thought it might work. Yelpers are pretty supportive of this place, and they tend to be a picky lot. "I'll check it out," I thought.  It still took me a few weeks. I was out of town for one, and then it was Sunday and they weren't open, and then we were broke.  I now consider those weeks wasted. I finally went today. Just about 45 minutes ago. And it was ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS. I had the Mahaka, a beef brat with things like "Maui Pico", "Maui Mustard", avocado, pepperoncinis and bacon. All of it on a perfectly crafted bun (the owner told me he has them specially made, and the cost is more than most restaurant's entire hot dog).  Anyway, it was a luau in my mouth, and everyone was invited.  I'm not often an evangelical for restaurants. If I like a place, I'll let people know in passing, "Oh, hey, St. Francis is really good" and whatnot. Before I even left Maui Dog, I was texting every Phoenician I knew telling them they needed to hit up Maui Dog as soon as humanly possible.  Oh, and it's cheap, too. And there are burgers and sliders and fresh cut fries and wings. And Hawaiian shaved ice. Seriously, stop reading...get over there.  There's only one thing I don't like, which is that it's Saturday, so I can't go eat there again tomorrow.

The service (ask for Matt) was tremendous...perhaps the best experience we've had with a server in Phoenix. Prices aren't cheap, but the quality is terrific, both in drinks and food. I recommend the Mojito and the pernil tacos. I'm glad this place is walking distance.  Only quibble: the techno beats fits the decor, but I wasn't into it.

Butters was REALLY great. I'll have to try a few more dishes before giving it 5 stars, but the prices were incredibly reasonable for Scottsdale, the service was prompt, and I agonized for a while over what to eat because everything looked so appealing.  The restaurant has an updated diner feel, and I wish they had one closer to us in central Phoenix, because the prices at OverEasy and Taylor Cafe are prohibitive. Seriously, if this place was located closer, we'd be there every weekend.  I was really satisfied with my skillet. I wouldn't say it was amazing or anything, but breakfast food is tough to innovate, and I'm fine with it that way.  Also, it's kind of fun thinking about the South Park character, like when he became a pimp that one time.

It's a sportsbar, so I know I can't be too picky, but Majerle's could add at least one or two decent microbrews (Shock Top does NOT count) and they could freaking turn down the awful music mix during halftime at 2 pm on Saturday to sub-ear bleeding levels.  Great service, though! That should be mentioned.

Hey, did you know this place was started by firemen? Well, if you didn't, you're an idiot, because it's plastered all over nearly everything.  My sandwich was decent. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. Before I went, I wondered what their gimmick would be. Besides the firefighter thing, I mean. It turns out their gimmick is steaming their sandwich meat.  Now, I'm no expert, but in my experience with culinary parlance, "steaming" ranks somewhere below "slow-roasted", "braised", or "thinly-sliced" and somewhere slightly above "microwaved". I'm open-minded, though. I'd try this uniquely steamed meat. It turns out, I COULD tell the difference. The difference was the meat was warm and wet, almost like it had absorbed a bunch of vaporized air.  What makes Firehouse Subs stand out is their bread, which was really, really good. It was better than Jimmy John's bread, in fact. But between the steaming, the onslaught of fire-fighting paraphernalia, the longer wait, and the higher cost at Firehouse Subs, I'll take Jimmy John's every time. And it's only slightly farther away. I'm down with supporting heroes, but I'd also like to eat reasonably-priced, un-steamed sandwiches on occasion.

O.H.S.O. is working it. They've got a good selection of beers and that propagates Phoenix's beer revolution, and they're liberal with the samples, which is terrific. With the exception of the arepas, the menu is fairly standard pub fare. I don't recommend the arepas, though, or at least the tuna one. It just wasn't clicking.  O.H.S.O.'s best aspect is ambiance. With warm colors and wood accents, it feels like a nice, friendly pub you can bring your kids to. Considering the other options for decent beer selections around central Phoenix, O.H.S.O. isn't perfect, but it might be the best short of a drive to Papago.  Also, Arizona's beer culture is picking up, but it is just not there yet. I appreciate O.H.S.O.'s dedication to local brewers, but they'd be better off reaching into California/Oregon/Colorado than hosting a bunch of mediocre Fretzky's taps. Or at least some of Four Peaks better stuff...

I love what R+D is going for here: swank, some tricky mixing, and top quality drinks. My G+T (gin and tonic with the gin infused right in front of me, and a number of other embellishments) was phenomenal. The service was friendly. Once you get in, that is. It's worth the experience.  Honestly, though, I think I'd just prefer downstairs at Citizen. The whole idea of a "speakeasy" brings to mind a cozy, inviting, secretive place, and R+D isn't cozy. The decor is coldly modern, it's loud as hell (especially since the seating is too far apart to talk comfortably), and the clientele isn't my kind of thing. Some asshole tuxedoed guy tried to bypass my friend and I in line by whipping out a stack of credit cards and whispering to the bouncer "I'll make it worth your while".  So, all in all, here's what I'm saying: absolutely try out R+D. It's fun and interesting and the mixing is a thrill to watch. Then, just get your cocktails downstairs at the marvelous Citizen Public House, because they're just as good, the money goes to the same place, and you can have a discussion with companions without shouting. Or follow Greg H's advice below, and maybe show up on a Thursday, because that G+T really was something else.

For three and a half years we've lived in the Valley, and for three and a half years we've searched for the sort of reasonably priced, fresh sushi was had frequent access to in Portland. Some places are phenomenal but bankroll-busting (Roka Akor). Some places are decent, but you're still overpaying (Stingray, Ra, everywhere else I've gone).  How Do You Roll? is a horribly-named chain out of Austin. It's the Chipotle of sushi, where you pick the ingredients, and some guy who looks like he belongs at Chipotle or Starbucks puts it together for you, and there are all kinds of options. It's disconcerting. Everything about this place seems like it'll suck.  But you know what? It's pretty damn good. I'm not saying this is the best sushi in town. I'm not even saying it's as good as somewhere like Stingray (which, as I mentioned, isn't all that great, either). But it's close, and you get what you want. And the best part? You don't feel like you're getting gouged. It doesn't even feel like going out.  I'm convinced How Do You Roll? is going to be a gamechanger. It's going to draw Americans to sushi who wouldn't have considered it otherwise. It'll be an affordable way for sushi lovers to get their fix. There's plenty to balk at (again, that name is AWFUL), but this is our new sushi default in the Valley.  ADDENDUM: After a third visit, some cracks showed. The seaweed wrap was doubled up or something, and became obnoxiously chewy. Then our cashier charged us for eight meats instead of four, and it took quite some time to remedy the situation. Also, I've got the feeling they're masking the taste of the sushi with sauce. (This is not a place for sashimi or nigiri.) Anyway, we'll try again, but I was scared off a bit. Fortunately, if my wife's craving it, there's always Five Guys, Chipotle and Jersey Mike's nearby if I'm in the mood for something else.
