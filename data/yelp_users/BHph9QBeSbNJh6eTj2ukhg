Wow...if you are looking for a great date bar to take a lady for a fine drink and want to set the mood....this place is definitly at the top of the list for me and you would be wise to place it on yours as well.  Super dark, swanky, candles, couches,great dj and some nites they have live acoustic.  If your date is not into you by the end of the evening at this place she never will be my man.  I am pretty sure if Tiger had a mistress in Phoenix and didnt want to be seen he would take her to Merc Bar.

What a cool little hidden gem in Phoenix. Went on a sat night.  Live funk, jazz, blues. The band is basiclly on the dance floor. If you are clausterphobic it takes a few drinks to get comfortable..quarters are tight it gets crowded and there is no outside patio. Drinks are cheap compared to Scottsdale. The bar has a great ambiance..what you would visualize a great jazz club to be. Its dark with red xmas lights lining the ceiling, but it works for this place..if you are looking to get away from the typical Scottsdale crowd of Ed Hardy wearing roided up tools And coked out barbie dolls that cant hold an intellectual conversation if they tried...check this place out.

Yes five stars...well done Cibo...Weather you sit at small bar, inside, or great out front patio with it's well placed heat lamps I rank it above LGO in Arcadia which says something. Nestled Into a old style house in downtown Phoenix on a neighborhood street. Had one of the salads, pizza, and their berry/chocolate crepe for desert...all of it was porn food heaven...and a definite Top Ten place in Phoenix to take a date you really like. You may want to park a few blocks away to walk off the calories or hit up the dance floor at Chars has the Blues nearby.

I decided to branch out and try a different sports bar near me for a Cardinals game. The place, as I expect on game day was full of patrons. One thing it was not full of was busers and bar backs. The place is a logistical servers nightmare. The tables were full of half empty beer bottles and the poor wait staff not only had to try and serve everyone but keep the tables clean. That my friends, and I timed it on my phone, made for a 25 minute wait before a server came to our table for the first time which was full of empty glasses and beer bottles. That is new record wait time for speaking to a server.  Our server was nice, but they they were all drowning.  As far as food, the wings I had were good and place is big and has a ton of TVs and a big patio which is why I give it 2 stars.

Five stars is definitely tough to give but this place gets it. The ambiance, food, and service were all amazing. For me,it is definitely a special occasion type of place. Great romantic spot, but guys I wouldn't take a crap shoot first or second date here. A dinner for two will run 200 bucks easily, especially if you do the 75 dollar a head six coarse meal, which is what we ordered and it was organic food porn heaven, every coarse. Set aside about two hours for this meal, they space it out perfectly between courses, so when that six coarse dessert hits the table I still was able to fit it in my belly and not feel disgustingly bloated and did not need a "I'm too overweight to walk scooter" when I left.

Love this little hidden Gem in Arcadia off Indian school. Has a cute interior and outdoor patio that has been dog friendly. My dog has always been given a bowl of water, on top of that Iv yet to have had bad service. Everyone has been lovely and I get the sense they enjoy working here.  Now to the food. It's fresh and much of it to my understanding is locally grown. The menu is not overwhelming so what is on it has been outstanding.  They used to serve breakfast during week but sadly now it's only on weekends. They often have live music on some week nights and during brunch on Sundays.

Beautiful facility, check. Roided out dudes with tatts, check. Roded out gorilla looking women, check.  Older women with bedazzled trucker hats and dragon designed yoga pants and enough make-up to put on a Mary Kay exhibit, check. Countless amounts of  eyecandy with gym shoes to match the skin tight gym attire, check. Quagmire type guys who are hitting on the ladies between every set, check. Wives flirting with their young buff trainers, check. Tons of state of the art equipment and weights, check. Over priced Cafe food, check.  Great pool, cardio, yoga, and spin classes, check.  Priciest gym in the valley for sure at around 90 a month, but looking at the abundance of BMW's and Mercedes in the parking lot, I dont think the crowd up North is to concerned. All in all worth the price of admission :)

Potential ambiance of this place is awesome. The decor, paint, music spun by the DJ were all outstanding. Very dark, sexy,swanky lounge and great patio. Went to check it out on a sat night and at 1030 there was maybe ten people inside and the bartender said that was the most people in the place at once that night.   I had only heard of this place by word of mouth. They obviously need to aggressively advertise otherwise this will be sadly another victim of Dc Ranch very shortly.

If you like the Merc bar in Biltmore area you will like this place. The two are similar . Very sexy dark atmosphere at this lounge, well dressed professional crowd, not to big of place, brick wall interior, leather couches, a secret Scooby Doo bookcase VIP room and great music mixes the night I went.

Been here twice.  First time I sat at a table and service was good. Sushi Rolls were good. It was a Saturday night and it was kinda dead...which is odd for the great location and the great set up of the place. Went for a second time and again it was dead on a Friday night...this should have been a sign. Second time I took a date who is a cook and has written a few books.  Not a time for Jimmy's to drop the ball. We chose the bar seating this time.  Service was god awful slow and the drinks sat dry for quite a while...my date's broccoli and meat was out at least 15 minutes before my rolls. She took one bite and gave it back. It tasted like something out of Panda Express. It was taken off the bill, but we received no apology from management. I give it a star for location and ambiance and a star for good rolls.

I love breakfast. Unfortunately there is not many cozy cafes up north here. Found this hidden gem other day while I happened to be in the parking lot. Very hard to spot, the signage was not well designed, to small, so it doesn't grab your eye. If you have walleye vision forget it, it's invisible basically.   The cafe is cute and cozy. Got there around 1245 ish and was surprised that it wasn't  more crowded. The menu was fresh and highly organic. I stuck to my favorite of steak and eggs. Eggs were well cooked, and the steak comes in thinly sliced cuts, which were actually pretty tasty. Normally when you get toast at a breakfast joint the jam or jelly comes in those 5 cent plastic tubs that for all I know are a decade old and packaged in Bangkok by 6 year olds , not here. They use fresh organic stuff here scooped into a heap that is eatable in itself. Nice work.  Staff was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. The prices were moderate I'd say. Our bill for two was close to 30 bucks which is a bit pricey for breakfast, but I'm sure rent in that location is a business killer. My only missing desire was they didn't have a stack of courtesy newspapers. You can't have a breakfast joint and not have a morning paper to browse through while sipping on a delicious coffee in my perfect world.

Interior is nice. Charming patio. Menu is nothing really unique.  I was disappointed that they only had regular coffee, no Americano's, not even an Espresso machine which seems odd this day and age for a "Cafe". For not looking to busy, service was pretty slow. The roast beef and pastrami sandwiches were good. Server was very nice, but seemed like they were having major issues with the cooks in back getting things done right and in timely manner. No water at tables and took ages for unripe tomatoes. What sandwich place doesn't have Dijon?

I am neither a yogi or spin aficionado by any means. With the flexibility of a rock and zero spin experience prior. I am living nearby and was given a  shove to try the Monday night spin class...I reluctantly took a night off from "Chest Day" at the local meathead gym to expand my experiences. Beautiful and clean facility. The staff is wonderful. You can tell they love their job and it shows with the warm service  and smiles. The cafe has good selection of healthy choices with a dog friendly patio. I cannot compare it to other spin classes, since I have no prior experience, but needless to say I'm hooked to a weekly spin class and will be trying a yoga class hopefully soon. Only thing that may bother you, is if you have a touch of claustrophobia, the spin room is a tight fit, but I have found that after about five minutes you become so focused on the workout that the anxiety will subside.

Newest Dog off leash dog park in Phoenix area. Both a separate large and small dog area. The city of phoenix did a wonderful job on these, very aesthetically appealing. All grass, with included dog water fountains in each area. The only reason I drop a star is because it's right near Interstate 10, so if you are looking for tranquil quietness to meditate while your pup plays, that's not going to happen.

Yes yes and yes..I have become a breakfast foodie and  coffee snob over the years. This place is the shit!  Everything I have tried, has been spot on and cooked close to perfect with good quality ingredients! The coffee..is some of the best Italian made coffee around..either just the regular cups or if your with a coffee buddy GET THE FRENCH PRESS!! Beware if you come on weekends it's an hour wait if you are lucky. This place is in my top 3 in the valley for breakfast.  The patio is also dog friendly and faces north so it's never in direct sunlight.
