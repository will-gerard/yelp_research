I went to BJ's for a group birthday celebration and overall had a good time. The grilled chicken potato was good as usual, as was the berry cider. Our service was a bit slow but the waitress was friendly and trying her best.

We drove past at least five other ice cream places to get here with an out of town friend to have sundaes. When we received our sundaes they were sans whipped cream. When we asked about it they said "oh, sorry we are out of whipped cream." WTF sugar bowl?! Poor form.

I have been to Fez a few times with friends who love it and I keep hoping that it will grow on me, but it just hasn't. The inside is very loud with poor traffic flow and the patio is poorly lit and very close to the street. I was the lucky recipient of food poisoning from my last visit. I will not be returning.

The atmosphere is lovely. Stone, wood, and leather abound. The lounge had a fire going and a talented man playing the piano and singing. Service in the lounge was less than stellar, we waited nearly 20 minutes for a drink. Service in the dining room was nearly as slow, and infrequent. I found the menu to be rather limited, and my gnocchi was over-cooked to nearly a mashed-potato consistency.

This place is disgusting, I would not take my dog back to this place. The building is in poor condition, the bathrooms were covered in profanity and the doctor seemed like he was drunk. He repeated himself often and didn't seem too aware of his surroundings.

I chose this service based on Yelp reviews. Yelp-fail.   The first time these folks came they were late and REEKED of cigarette smoke. They spent 3.5 hours here, and while things were good on the surface, it was not a deep cleaning. None of the blinds or fans were dusted and there were still dirty fingerprints on the bathroom light switch from the kids.   I complained and the owner sent out a new crew who was on time and faster but still did not provide a deep clean. All of the corners of the tiled rooms had dust and pet hair AFTER sweeping and mopping.   I will not be using this service again.

Had a great visit here with my 9 year old this afternoon. He loved the gelato and we had a good time playing the mini foosball game that was out on the table. Very friendly owner, clean seating area and great music. We will be back.

Here is the breakdown -  4 stars for donuts and coffee. Both were fresh and good 3 stars for staff. Competent but slightly rude.  0 stars for charging 50 cents for using a credit card. This is a poor business practice and I won't be back because of it.

I ordered the pumpkin spice rum cake for Thanksgiving. The flavor of the filling was good but the cake was slightly bitter and there was far too much cool-whip like frosting.   My other experience with rum cakes was at http://www.auntiesrumcakes.com/ when I lived in Ohio and Auntie's cakes are far superior to Lisa's.

Marie and her team are fantastic! Flexible with schedule and always go above and beyond. Great with all of our pets and working around the boys' lego creations that are usually out on a desk or table when she arrives.

I am so glad I found this office and Tiffany Jackson. I am done having babies, but this is still a great place for routine gyn care. LGBT friendly, too!

Tiffany and Ramona have both moved on to another local practice that integrates moms, doctors, and midwives much better than Boojum/iWomens ever did. Dr. Vegh and Dr. Murphy have also left the practice, which leaves only Dr. Kells. The last time I was in this office the front desk personnel were disorganized and the entire office seemed to be in a state of chaos. I will not be returning nor recommending this practice to anyone.

The ladies who run this place are fantastic. Great with names and faces, even better with quiche and desserts! Lunch specials could have slightly better pricing, but homemade food like mom used to make isn't cheap these days.

Fantastic food, atmosphere, and staff. We had amazing service through our entire visit and the food and drinks were wonderful. A great place to visit for date night before heading over to FilmBar to catch a flick.

Basic gym, not a lot of frills, priced accordingly.   The good: Plenty of machines, the place is clean, always open,  with the Black Card membership hydro massage beds, red light therapy, and tanning are free and unlimited.   The not-so-good: Front desk staff seems annoyed with life, barcode scanner on cards would be helpful, more free weights and Smith machines would be utilized, better flow and placement of machines would be very appreciated  The bad: bowls of candy on the desk, pizza and bagel parties, Fox News constantly on several of the TVs.

I followed Tiffany here from her previous office and am glad I did. The office is very comfortable and homey and the office staff inside the office are very kind and warm. Tiffany is very LGBT friendly, too.  I took one star off because the scheduling department has some room for improvement in terms of scheduling and phone courtesy.

This place is within walking distance of my house and has an amazing view, so I really wanted to like it.   My first visit was at happy hour on a week night. It was about half full and our waitress was great when she was around. The queso was good, the drinks were tasty, and the entrees were ok, but nothing fantastic.   My second visit was for Sunday brunch. The sign said to seat ourselves but the hostess followed us around, clearly trying to guide us to where she wanted us to sit. The brunch buffet is $19 and not worth it. Service was slow, drinks from the bar were slower, and my friend's made to order omelet took nearly 20 minutes to arrive.   I will not be returning for a third visit any time soon.
