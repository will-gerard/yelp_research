Y'know, I had to give myself a while to get over the figurative gastronomical blue balls I suffered at the hands of Flavors of India.  So here's the scoop.  I'm a business guy. This place isn't much to look at from the outside and there weren't but a couple of cars outside. They've a banner touting their differentiating advantage... "Ice cold Coca Cola served here."  Ok, you have Coke..grand.  1965 is jealous.  But I loooove Indian food & even though I couldn't tell if they served alcoholic beverages, specifically Indian beers, from the online menu (they do) we throw caution to the wind & go on anyway.  We could always leave, right?    So upon entering we're immediately seized by the most pleasant aroma... Imagine the aroma scent finger seducing you to scarf down the big steaks like in Tom and Jerry.   Seriously, I saw that. It smelled delicious.   The gentleman who greeted us was pleasant and I assume the owner.  I've driven by here dozens of times and like I said, I seldom see more than a couple cars here.  Today was no different.  There were a total of 5 tables being occupied.  The people at 2 were eating and 2 were wrapping up in idle chatter.  At first I figured the lone server, who I figured to be the owner's wife as they were close in age, was simply being conscientious in not wanting to rush us to order.  After she passed our table a half dozen times and managed to avoid the eye contact we tried to connect with, we were able to ask what the really good looking food the couple at the booth next to us was.  Maybe it was my imagination, but the answers was curt and she seemed slightly annoyed. Again, as a business person I'd be excited.  Clue: those are buying signals.  We'd been there 10 minutes or so now and hadn't ordered.  Again, there are just 5 booths/tables occupied and all are nestled together in a tight cluster and I'm situated between two of them.  After another 4 or 5 passes from 1 to 3 and skipping me at table two, I wave, say "excuse me" and the lady puts up the "hold on finger" before I finally get her to let me order a beer and appetizers.  Clue: I'm buying alcohol and appetizers, we're polite and well coifed.  We may be a good table.  The sales guy in me is screaming inside at her inattention by now.  After 25+ minutes and having not been able to order an entree in a relatively empty place, it's a wrap. I ask for the check.  They tell me they were changing over their oil to explain delay. What's that got to do with paying attention to a customer? Nada.  I take the samosas to go and head to one of my fav restaurants instead.  It's a shame really, because I ate one of those samosas in the car and it was damned good. I mean, it was frickin' delicious and I suspect the solid reviews they've had on food would hold up. If only these guys could get selected to go on Bar Rescue to learn to attract and keep new customers.

I stumbled upon this place.  I went to ASU, ahem... like a decade ago, and never knew this place was here.  I'm a HUGE fan of Indian food and eat it every time I travel, so I'd like to think I know good ones from bad.  There are a few buffets around the valley I've been to and some skimp on the protein.  Some serve food that's gotten old and even stale.  These guys are a great value for the price, have ample meats for the non-veggies, and are pretty attentive.  Can't beat what they offer for the price.

I love this place.  I come here for meetings and to study.  Very cool beer selection... which always ends up cutting my study short.  You'd think I'd fix that, but , eh..

I don't have the vocabulary to give these guys high enough praise, but I'll be effusive with it though.  They were simply phenomenal.  Having made the mistake of finding movers off Craig's List before (DON'T do it), I decided to try pros based on a strong recommendation and overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews.   I had a 7AM start time, they arrived  at 6:45. Good start.  Good impression.    Let me tell you. They worked hard and they worked fast.  My place is a difficult move.  It's a tri-level, ultra contemporary property and so it has a a lot of sharp angle and a very narrow stairway.   And the bedroom & office are on the third floor, so all types of heavy furniture was up there.  And these guys' body language never even hinted at annoyance at the set up.  I was annoyed FOR them!   Everything was 'yes sir' or "sure thing", not that most people require that, but it's a nice touch and underscores their professionalism.  Bobby, Bobby & Jeff practically jogged to and from the truck, which you appreciate when you're paying by the hour.  The biggest thing-two of the guys, independent of one another said "I work for the best boss/best man a guy could work for.." and then volunteered why they thought so. The owner should be proud. SOLD. I expect a lot when I pay for a service.  These guys delivered and I simply won't use anyone else going forward.  They were a little higher than some other guys, even before tip,  but you get what you pay for and if you value your time and stuff, that's a good thing with movers.

I arrived here for a Sunday brunch and the first thing I noticed was a man whom had removed his jacket that I figured to be the GM.  He was outside cleaning and setting tables as someone who's run a business, that was exactly what you'd want to see from your leadership and that set the table of expectation for the rest of my visit.  His name was Alex.  He and our server Casey were excellent.  The food was pretty good too.  I'm a SW boy and had the brunch tacos- I subbed chx for chorizo and my inner fat kid loved it!  I live close & hadn't been here since they changed management.  They've changed the menu quite a bit to reflect regional tastes and they get two thumbs up. The other menu simply tried too hard.   Lastly- as we were leaving we wanted to see the pool above the restaurant.  Alex, understanding we weren't guests but could be at some point, made it a point to meet us at the gate we didn't have a key for to key us in the area.  Great anticipation and very memorable.  Obviously I recommend this place and my inner foodie does too.

"These fries are why I fear going to a nursing home. They just look... neglected.. And old."  This direct quote from a friend as we TRIED to put on our best good-sport faces..  But yuck!  Too greasy to eat.  We salted them like we were transporting meat on the open frontier in the pre-refrigerated transport days.  Still unpalatable.  We tried these chicken fingers after refusing to eat the nachos we'd ordered.  HOW do you make bad nachos?   I mean. NACHOS! The meat tasted like fowl boiled in a caldron sometime during the Pre Spice-Wars Middle Ages. We also left the over iced chambord margarita on the table unconsumed and made our way across the parking lot to Z-Tejas to get the real ones.  I've learned my lesson about straying from the Tempe Zip's location.   Our server did her best, but she was playing piano in mittens.  Not a lot she could do with what she was given to work with. I am all for small business, but I couldn't lie to ya. They need Bar Rescue... Save your hard earned greenbacks.

SO I go into this place really not knowing what to expect and was blown away.  The food was frickin' delicious... Like, fat kid who goes against his budding moral compass and sneaks fries out of his family's fast food bag because they foolishly trusted him to hold it on the drive home good.  I don't normally go for greasy, messy food but I could do nothing all all to stop eating to avoid the food coma I felt coming on after getting over wearing a bib.  MOST impressive though, is that I couldn't get over the fact that I couldn't figure out who the manager was by body language because EVERYONE seemed to really hold customer service very important.  Everyone was attentive.  They all seemed invested.  I put a reminder in my phone to grab a coupon when Local Dines had another one.  Greedy! Right? LOL  That good.

I'm sitting in Ihop right now, a chain I hadn't frequented in years, and I felt compelled enough to write a Yelp review about my experience.  I'd written off the chain years ago, largely because I don't really frequent chains, but mostly because of the apathy towards food quality and in service I'd grown accustomed to expect at their locations.  Today, that changed for me.  ...At least for this location.  Grudgingly I found myself wandering over for a late breakfast/brunch while I get some car work done nearby and figured I'd suck up their wi-fi while I wait.  My server, this young guy named Bradley, is easily one of the most professional, pleasant and accommodating servers I've ever experienced.  I won't tell him this, but he could probably be earning more somewhere else higher in the experienced server food chain.  I'm sitting here with my laptop open and I notice all the servers here seem to be intuned to the same idea about customer service, and the customers reciprocate.  I'm hearsing sir, ma'am, yes please  - flowing freely, reciprocally from customers.  Maybe it's the location?  Maybe it's time of day as well.  Most of the people here are seniors.  Whatever the reason, I think the team and management here should be proud of the customer experience they create.  Today Ihop won back a customer.
