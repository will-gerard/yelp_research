I used to love this place.  Their happy hour was fabulous (half price apps!) and the shrimp scampi pizza was scrum-diddly.  I would come in for a sandwich at lunch.  All of my favorite things dishes have been altered or removed on the new menu, which is just bad luck on my end of course.  I totally respect the Green/organic and GF direction, but I feel that the changes were a bit too drastic, leaving my mainstream palate feeling alienated.  Came in for the new happy hour, was truly bummed out, since it used to be so good.  Could have understood the narrowing of options, and offering five dollar plates instead of full sizes at half-price, but the new recipes tasted plain awful, and I felt a bit screwed.  First: meatball sliders, served with avocado, Roma tomato, and a basil leaf I believe.  Sounds good, right?  In reality, a real bitch-kitty to consume.  Flimsy bread that disintegrated under the weight of a whole, lukewarm, dry, and practically flavorless meatball, combined with a *wedge* of avocado  - turned what is meant to be a finger food into a fork and knife affair.  The whole thing just fell apart after the first bite, and was tasteless to boot.  Pesto bread: the pesto soaked in to the bread in an unattractive way and was (again) bland, cheese was rubbery in the extreme.  And again on the GF bread, with no apparent options for something else.  I'm sure that it tastes awesome to someone who shits liquid for days after eating the regular stuff, I respect that.  But for me, blech.  Just give the option, please, don't force feed me the compressed crumbs bread.  Had I known better, I would have ordered it on foccacia.  Wish I had been given the choice on the happy hour menu.  Then, the stuffed peppers.  Wish I had known they were SO spicy and SO acidic, my palate was blown out with the first bite, glad it didn't precede anything else, or I wouldn't have tasted the rest of the meal.  Thankfully, the salads are still YUM and would be what I order if I ever return, since I am not a big pasta fan.  My favorite pizza, the shrimp scampi, is now neopolitan style.  Meh, no thanks.  And in my mourning, I don't want to try any others.  ;) Fickle, I know.  Decor is looking a bit matronly at this location.  I always remember the Flagstaff location being much brighter, airier.  This one feels...lackluster.      They obviously had to make some sacrifices in layout due to the size of the space, and as mentioned elsewhere, it feels a bit odd, even dowdy.  The feeling emanates from the staff as well.  All skilled, polite, and hardworking, don't get me wrong, but not lively at all.  Service is efficient, but not engaging, at least not for me.  GM is nice and gets the job done well, but always seems stressed.    One thing that put me off on my last visit - I mentioned my disappointment at the disappearance of the chalk-board happy hour, including $5 martini Thursdays, and my server's tone was borderline rude in replying.  She treated me like a rube, which I don't appreciate.  They had a good value for the guest and they took it away, probably because it wasn't making them any money, I get that and respect their change in direction.  But don't be rude to a semi-regular who is inquiring nicely.  Just smile and shrug, point out the new stuff, don't act like I am a chinz for asking.  I guess this just isn't my kind of place anymore.  The happy hour was really what brought me back and it is boring and flavorless now.  The organic thing is awesome, guys, but it still has to taste good!    They are catering to a niche market, I hope this suburb can support the location.  I love local businesses and hope they succeed.  Good luck and farewell, Picazzo's.

Not much to say that hasn't already been said about this place! My old reliables are the Portabella Farm Salad with green goddess dressing (YUM) and the Fontina Burger with garlic fries (YUMMMM). The salmon plate is also really good (that coleslaw tho.) I really need to try some other things on the menu but it's so hard to break away from my faves!   I love taking a little turn around the farm afterwards. This place is such a treasure to our city.

If you are reading these reviews and have never indulged in the tasty delights served by Cornish Pasty Company, you must get your ass over there as soon as possible!  The variety of options is astounding for a place with a menu largely dominated by a single item: the humble pasty.  Nearly every major cuisine is represented, and for the vegetarians, this place is mecca, because there are just as many options on that side of the menu as the omnivorous one.  They also have a few sides (Cauliflower and Broccoli Cheese Bake is f*cking INCREDIBLE), salads, soups, and desserts.  Strangely enough, I've never tried any of the desserts, but they all look amazing.  Me and the boyfriend's favorite flavors include Rosemary Steak, Lovely Bit of Salmon, Bangers and Mash, Peppered Steak, and The Royale with Cheese (yes, they have a cheeseburger option, perfect for a picky kid, just don't let them eat the whole thing!)  And speaking of portion size, don't think when you first behold your precious pasty that it is nothing to write home about in terms of size.  That little football will fill you to the brim, (this is probably the reason I've never had their desserts!)  They are great to split with a friend along with a salad or other side, if you are looking to lighten it up a bit.  I can't really comment on the service.  Since the Mesa location is a quarter mile from our house, we always order out.  From what I can tell, they are packed every night.  We never have any problems with our order, though now I think of it, the last time I called to place one, the phone just rang and rang with no answer, and we ended up getting My Arepa.  No big, though.  I'm so glad this concept is expanding in the Valley, Cornish Pasty is quickly becoming an institution in this town, so if you haven't been yet, make it happen!

Hands down the best place for clean eating in Phoenix. So so so yummy, I'd eat there daily if it was close and I had $13-25 bucks to shell out on every meal. They're expanding their space once again, but I wish they'd open a second location in Arcadia, folks up here would eat that ish UP.   Service can be pretty slow at times, but I can tell they're making an effort to speed it up, and honestly, I just don't care. Good food takes time and hipsters operate on their own internal clocks, so just expect it or gtfo. Soup and salad lunch is always a good choice if you really need to get in and out in an hour, otherwise order for pickup, make sure to pay over the phone, and take it back to the office or even monge on the patio.  I love the Rainbow Wrap, and the Falafel Caesar. Kale Salad is a good standby too. I wish they'd do a slightly refined dinner service on Friday and Saturdays with a changing menu, but I appreciate that they stick to their strengths, breakfast and lunch. Honestly, I haven't even tried 90% of the menu, but I can say without hesitation that it all is good.  And O, thee breakfast. I've only been there once for it but damn was it tasty.  If you wanna get your inner hippie on, get to Pomegranate. Seriously the best green eats evar.

My first taste of Torched Goodness was at Food Truck Friday today.  I got the Sea Salt Caramel and it was absolutely out of this world.  The portion was perfect, and the sea salt was in perfect counterpoint to the sweet custard.  It rivals the Butternut Squash crème brûlée at The Farm Kitchen, which was the best I've ever had until now.  I have to say, TG's is just a little creamier than The Farm's...theirs is a tad grainy, though that's probably the squash.   Anyway, get some Torched Goodness, it's friggin' delish!!

Short Leash Dogs is obviously a front runner in the relatively small but beautifully thriving food truck scene in Phoenix.  Their truck had one of the longest lines today (Food Truck Friday @ Phx Public Market), and since I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try Cajun, I went for the dogs.  The Igby dog I gleefully munched was spot on - the acidity and fresh crunch of the coleslaw balanced well with the richness of the blue cheese and the sweet tang of the BBQ sauce.   It was just messy enough to be satisfying without making you look like a sloppy fool while milling around the lot.  And chasing it with local prickly pear soda = heaven.  It was a satisfying meal and not too expensive for the quality delivered.  Their menu is well-rounded, always important for a food truck since the menu needs to be small.  With five combinations of toppings, all with wildly differing flavor profiles, six choices of dog, plus the build-your-own option, there is something for everyone.  Their meat dogs are from Schreiner's, so you're golden with any choice you make there, and there is a veg option, as well, which I will never, ever be commenting on.  They also have a special of the day dog, which you'll have to arrive early for, since the devotees generally gobble them up.  And more power to them - the special I saw on the board looked amazing, and I was sorry I had missed it, having arrived an hour and a half into service.  The only reason I am daring to knock a star off this rating is that there is one tiny thing that needles me: the bread they use.  Don't get me wrong, the flatbread is delicious, inventive, and conducive to a not-too-messy eating experience.  It's a crucial part of their style of hot dog, and Short Leash's followers are nuts about it.  But...for me, I felt that they have a slight packaged quality to them that reminds me of Trader Joe's, which is not a horrible by any means, but it leaves me craving something more....  I can't help but wish they would add just one more option of bread/bun - in my opinion, a pretzel bun would make a killer addition.  Short Leash Dogs is a gem in the food truck scene and is absolutely not to be missed by local foodies.  I'm looking forward to trying all of their combinations in the years to come.

Atmosphere = ***  Unfortunately, my first impression of the place was the smell of cleaner.  The chemical smell in the air lingered for the duration of our stay.    The layout is nice, spacious without being cavernous and tastefully decorated, if somewhat lacking personality.  Just clean, standard modern decor.  I went at 8 am this morning (Sunday) and there were only half a dozen guests.  I am guessing that, once filled with people, the vibe is a bit more exciting.  As many have mentioned, BLD is located in the soul-sucking, cultural-void suburb that is Chandler.  The lack of tasty treats in the area definitely contributes to the buzz around this place, since the only other decent restaurants of the non-chain variety are in 'Downtown' Chandler.    The drive-thru option is solid gold, (you have to call ahead for meals, of course.)  Very smart idea by whoever orchestrated the build-out.  Service = ****  Very good.  We were greeted immediately by the hostess.  Our server checked in with us often enough to feel welcome and taken care of, but not so often that we felt smothered.  When we had a complaint on our food, he handled it smoothly and without any trace of attitude, but did not overcompensate with repeated apologies either.  Well done.  Food = **  Our breakfast was disappointing.  Conceptually, the menu has a lot of promising ideas, but the recipes/execution were lacking.  There was a good variety of choices without being too many, (a giant menu is almost always a bad sign.)  My vanilla latte had WAY too much vanilla, could barely taste or smell the coffee at all.  I left half of it behind.  The boyfriend and I are benedict addicts, so that's what we went for.  He had the short rib, and I had the crab cake.    I felt two ways about the citrus hollandaise on my crab benedict.  The texture was superb, thick but somehow light and very creamy.  The flavor, unfortunately, was far too sweet.  Combined with the natural sweetness of the crab meat, it made for a more confectionary experience than savory one.  The crab was good (no imitation crap), but sadly underseasoned and crying for more of a sear on the outside to lend some texture and color.  The eggs were a bit overdone - when I cut into them I got a trickle of yolk instead of the flood of it that all benedict-lovers crave.    The short rib benedict featured meat far too dry for the cut.  The dryness left the meat with a charred aftertaste that wasn't incredibly pleasant.  The red wine hollandaise was decent, but lacked the acid that I assumed a red wine hollandaise would have.  The eggs were a bit better on this go-around.  The potatoes served with both meals were barely room temperature.  We told our server and received a fresh portion, which were hotter, but still had the same rubbery texture as the last.  That being said, they were beautifully seasoned.  There was plenty of good flavor going on, but texture was really lacking.  There was no crunch or bite, only chew chew chew chew.  Our server automatically brought ketchup in portion cups, which seemed a bit wasteful.  A plain old bottle would have sufficed.  With some recipe tweaking and practice on the line, both of these dishes have potential.  I will definitely give this place another try, but it won't be anytime soon.   With the lack of options in the area, I am guessing they will be successful.

I took a chance on Arcadia Farms for my birthday lunch today and I'm so happy I did!  It was a wonderful meal.    Atmosphere = *****  I've been wanting to go here for a while, having driven by once on my way from Daily Dose - it was love at first sight.  I was beckoned by the wine colored awning and cream umbrellas, invited by the small front patio dotted with greenery.  Just walking into the entrance is a treat.  The interior is so sweet and cozy, very feminine with a touch of beach cottage feel.  The back patio looks gorgeous and wonderfully shady - I will definitely request a table out there next time I visit.    Service = ****  Service wise, no complaints.  Our waitress was very pleasant and handled our meal fluidly, if not with a lively personality.  There were three of us, no special orders, dining in the afternoon during a slow period (the place was a little less than half full), so there's your grain of salt.  Food = ****  Okay, now - the FOOD.  Namely, the Chicken, Wild Mushroom, and Leek Crepes.  I love me a savory crepe, and these blew me away.  The filling also had goat cheese (for the win!), and and the whole thing was covered in a basil beurre blanc.  The basil was a different sauce that had been swirled over the beurre blanc - so pretty!  And the perfect portion - ample, not skimpy, not too filling.  Best thing I've eaten out in a while!  Everything else we ordered was solid - tasty and and fresh, but for me, the crepe dish rose above the rest.  Still, all was delicious, though there were a few little things that could be worked on, in my opinion.  The noshing bread provided was yummy, but could have been a bit warmer (time of day has an influence on that, of course.)  The Crab & Avocado Stack was light and refreshing, a great starter.  The Baked Goat Cheese could have used a seasonal fruit accompaniment, since the crostini ran out before the dip did.  The Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad had great flavors, but was a little dry and had a touch too much lettuce to toppings ratio.  My friend's Warm Chopped Vegetable Salad was not particularly pleasing to the eye and I didn't take the opportunity to taste it, but she said it was delicious.  Also, we slurped down a sweet little vat of white wine sangria, which was a little weak for my taste, but still really enjoyable.  I think it would be at its best on a hot summer day.  I'm going back to try the breakfast soon, and I'm looking forward to checking out their marketplace across the street!

(FYI - This is the first time I have ever gone to a nail salon, so my review should be taken with a grain of salt.)  That being said, nearly everything went fabulously.  I got a Deluxe pedicure, which included callus removal (mine were heinous!), a fruity sugar scrub, some kind of creamy mask, then a paraffin wax treatment, and finally a hot stone massage.  Soooo relaxing.  My polish looks perfect.  It came to $50 plus tip, their pedi services start at $20.  My tech was very gracious (I told her it was my first time).  She made a few nice attempts at small talk, but backed off once she saw that such a thing is not my strong suit.  Good instincts on her end, she could tell that I prefer staring off into space and listening to my Ipod!  :)  During the paraffin and the hot stone she made sure to check that it wasn't too hot for me.  She gave great service.  The place seemed very clean, the layout and decor were very nice.  The only negative was the choice of TV programming (the place is small so it's hard to put your eyes anywhere else.)  They started with CNN (okay) and ended with the Disney Channel (really NOT good).  I don't think anyone getting a pedicure wants to watch Sharkboy and Lava Girl or whatever.  It seemed to be more what the receptionist wanted to watch, as opposed to the guests.  (She even flipped past Sex & the City!  Talk about a no-brainer in an ovarian-centered business.)  I will definitely be back!  Thanks, Jeniza!

The ambience is nice, but my pedicure is not. Cuticles are a mess and the polish job was very sloppy. Darlene did not do quality work, particularly at the $28 for basic pedicure price point. The worst looking pedicure I've ever received. I won't be going back.

Elegant and relaxing spot with a conceptually great menu that does not deliver on execution and flavor.   My french toast was dryyy as a bug fart. The bread was not a moist enough variety to begin with and was far too dense, it seemed to have soaked up very little liquid prior to being grilled. The lack of sauce was just silly, it's served with prickly pear syrup and creme fraiche that was one skimpy line each, the ratio to the amount of bread made no sense to me. I can understand if the chef doesn't want the plate drenched in sauces, but there was no balance there at all, and that dry, dense bread actually needed the drenching. At the very least, more syrup needs to be offered as an option when the food was delivered, and the bread should be switched to something fluffier that can get that buttery-sear-with-squishy-innards that french toast has to have to be good.  Our server Max was very very nice, but the service was irritatingly slow regardless, and not just from him, I could see another table trying to flag their server too. We were there before the Sunday rush and I get the feeling that the servers had too much side work and couldn't keep their focus on the tables? Just a guess there, but in any case it took way too long to get a check, and way too long for it to be run. I appreciate that the place is designed for loitering and that it's hard to find that balance between hovering and absenteeism, but they really need to work on it in my opinion.  I'll be back to give the lunch a shot, or to just grab a drink and read a while when time is not at all on my mind, but I really wouldn't recommend Gertrude's to anyone at this point, better to go The Farm or somewhere in Old Town and then mosey over to the Botanical Garden after. But I know they're really trying to make Gertrude's a great place and I'll be rooting for them. I'm guessing they face some specific challenges due to the location and hope they can find their groove.

Really solid place, I love the concept of healthy fast food, we need more and more concepts like this. Tasty and good for ya, nothing is totally amazing (again, it's sorta meant to be fast food.) I've been here at least two dozen times but only for takeout, it's just too much of a clusterf*** during peak times. Weekday breakfast has been wide open though, and to my recollection dinner all the time as well. It's just jammed at lunchtime.   Menu is a bit monotonous which makes sense for the concept (wish they had daily specials tho), staff varies between really nice and really standoffish, and I do not like their sandwich bread at all (wraps are a bit better.) Parking can be a real b of course cos of the location, so keep that in mind if doing takeout, and remember that a brief walk pre-meal is good for you.  Protein bowls are my favorite, salads are good too. Again, all really solid, nothing out of this world. Go go and go again, support businesses like this one, we need food like this to be our fast food!!! Love ya ChopShop!

Food: 4 Stars Drinks:4.5 Stars Service: 3.5 Stars Atmosphere: 3.5 Stars (Potential: 5 Stars - Barrelhouse isn't knocking it out of the park...yet!)  The Good: Cocktails! Them Apples was infinitely sippable, I could've had five of those lil' guys. Savory crepes, duck & dumplings, mussels - all were scrumptious and absolutely worth the duckets. It was a great early Saturday night meal to celebrate my mom's birthday.  The Meh: Pork belly was really off on the day I had it, it was dry and sort of musty in flavor, the crostini was sawdusty. (Or maybe the preparation just wasn't for me.) Service was mostly competent, but lukewarm, atmosphere is passable but a bit rough around the edges in it's current incarnation.  ---  Barrelhouse is a stellar addition to this part of the Southeast Valley. There's really nothing close to its caliber nearby. I have seen several restaurants and pubs come and go in the very spot it occupies, but I think this concept shows vastly more promise and has the opportunity to become a permanent fixture of the blooming SE Valley food scene.   The restaurant has an uncertain road ahead, as the immediate demographic is not cut out for the dinner price point on a frequent basis, and the neighborhood is a bit worn, without much by way of landmarks. The interior is a little heartbreaking to behold, it seems that the vision for the concept's atmosphere currently exceeds the funds available to execute it in reality. A remodel may be within reach at some point, or possibly a move to one of the new retail spaces being built across the street (assuming the landlord wants to foster local concepts.) Really, my only worry is that the location itself could bring this place down, not the need of small improvements to food and service.  I live a few miles away and look forward to frequenting Barrelhouse, I hope that many in my community will do the same and this fantastic little place will continue to succeed!

The $1 oysters during Little Cleo's brief happy hour are what drew me in and the rest did not disappoint. Like all FRCs, the ambience and service was super dupes, and like some FRCs, the food and drink was pretty damn good.   I had a champagne Royale with sage and honeysuckle and it was such sippy yumness, I'd drink a half dozen if not for the sweetness. The $2 champagne pour was also delightful. They did not have the saison that was on the menu (*sob*) but the IPA on tap was decent enough.  The HH oysters were salty gems of joy, mignonette was fairly good. Frog legs were so tender and wonderfully fatty, though the sauce was a bit too strong for me, but others at the table loved the punch of it. Hush puppies were fluffy little morsels, the dipping sauce a bit heavy but tasty nonetheless. The lobster roll was good, but needed more lemon and salt, and the dressing was a touch on the thin side. On the other hand, the spinach was a salt BOMB, great flavors and perfectly wilted but inedible by halfway through the portion. Didn't opt for dessert but my compatriots seemed to enjoy their banoffee tart well enough.   Far from legendary, but I will definitely be coming back.

I had a flawless experience at The Oculist. It was clear within moments of entering that a great deal of thought, passion, and damn good taste went into the selection of each frame on display. Every single piece of stock was sophisticated and current, with a broad range of designs, some quirky and some subtle. The price range is mostly moderate, with several on the high side and a fair variety on the low, so there are options for both the budget-conscious and those looking to splurge.  The owners, Angela and Brian, could not have been more warm, gracious, and relaxed. Having been smothered by a salesperson at LensCrafters a few days earlier, I was very aware of how perfectly non-pushy their approach was. They were keen in observing which styles I was gravitating towards (a broad spectrum, as I was looking to really change up my look), and providing me with alternate colors or similar options that I had overlooked, the latter always in the same price range and often cheaper. After choosing a bakers dozen or so of my favorites, I sat and began to narrow it down to my final purchase, and their humble confidence and impeccable eye for fit continued to make the process enjoyably and easily decisive.  I walked away with two gorgeous pairs of quality glasses at a reasonable price, and honestly reveled in the entire shopping experience from beginning to end. I was even lucky enough to receive my favorite of the two pairs a week early, just in time for a vacation I was taking. Angela and Brian's personalities, expertise, dedication and taste level is truly what makes this place special!

Been dying for the $5 cocktail deal lately and ended up taking a chance on lunch today, and it was glorious. I went for the tacos this time and while they ain't cheap, I wouldn't call them overpriced for the quality. The Pork Adovada, Braised Beef, and Crispy Fish were all scrummy (the latter two a bit more than the first), and the cucumber orange salad we ordered alongside was very near to perfect (they should cut the cukes a bit smaller). We also got the veggie burrito (whatever it's called) sans rice, and it was so frickin good, our eyes were rolling back in our heads. We were sweet talked into dessert and got the churros, a little too much sugar on them but they were so so good.  We got out of there for $42 bucks before tip for all of that and two happy hour cocktails. Very reasonable for such a flavor-packed meal, with succinct but personable, knowledgable, and speedy service, and of course the energetic atmosphere and mostly awesome playlist (I heard new Mac DeMarco and squeed with joy.) I'll definitely start coming here more often.

A resounding "meh". Great place for a group to drink and play games but I was totally underwhelmed by the food. Pretzels did not have the right texture and were more like bread rolls than anything else, butternut squash pasta was undercooked and had practically no flavors other than the sweetness of the squash. I'd come back to give other menu items a shot but my first go around was really unimpressive.

I tried Frites Street at the Melrose Street Fair and the Jerusalem Fries I munched were super good. Lemon herb chickpeas, pistachios, carrots, pomegranate seeds, raisins, and queso fresco on top of crispy steak fries with some onion mayo for dipping. I wish I had shared them as I couldn't get through the whole portion but no matter. The topping amount was generous but personally I would have taken even more of it and a few less fries. If I see them again while I'm out and about I won't hesitate to hit it. Yum!!

Good stuff! Crispy chicken skin po boy was like having the best part of fried chicken, cut with sweetness and acid of green apple slaw, and just spicy enough. Cauliflower with blue cheese and Frank's was full of flavor, I wish it had more of the pickled celery. Chefs there took care and we could see them tasting as they went. Would definitely suggest this place when visiting DeSoto Market.

I hadn't heard about Okra until I saw a mention on AZ Wilderness' Instagram about their delicious fare, after looking at the menu I knew I had to go stat and last night I was not disappointed.   I got the Okra cup cocktail with housemade Pimms, strawberry, cucumber, lemon, and seltzer and sucked it down in short order. We got a bunch of small plates. The fried chicken skin was a little too spicy for my lightweight palate but the other flavors in the dish held up to the heat very well. The mussels, oysters, and bone marrow plates were all glorious. The lemon pie was a great tart finish after the richness of the meal.  The service was perfectly on point. And our food came out SO fast, I realized I should've ordered our plates one or two at a time (the place was about 3/4 full at the time.) I wasn't careful in ordering so we ended up getting some kind of bread with all but one of the plates, I was so starry-eyed over the headliners I didn't think about the supporting acts, I'll pay more attention to balancing what we order next time so we don't carb-bomb ourselves again.  I loved it at Okra Cookhouse! Seriously drool-worthy!

Didn't thrill me, sadly. Atmosphere was a little on the generic side. We wandered in (there's no hostess stand so we shrugged and seated ourselves) and it took a few minutes to get acknowledged so that was a little annoying. Our server was good though, friendly and attentive.  The mussels were bland and the beer selection our server listed off was kinda boring. :\ I do want to come back and try their fish and chips sometime though.
