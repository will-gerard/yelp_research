Absolutely love this place. Arthur, Robin and the rest of the family are fabulous. They really know their stuff. All of their food is natural and healthy, won't find any Beneful here. We do pet sitting and have brought all of our pups here to visit and both them and the employees love it.  We have come here with several issues with both our cats and the pups we sit for and they always have great answers that are thoroughly researched.

The two stars are for the food. The food was great. If i were to rate only service it would be one or zero. I went here with my girlfriend and her sister. Excited to see a new sushi restaurant in the old spot of one of my favorite sushi restaurants, Mikado. I was impressed with the selection of sushi. So we placed our orders, the girls don't like seaweed so they ordered theirs on soy paper. When it was brought to us only her sisters was on soy paper. Ours was not. When we told the waiter he just stared at us until we asked if they could remake them. (I hated to ask, but my gf wouldn't eat the seaweed, and it is what we asked for). He then acted as if it was our fault, that we hadn't asked for it, even though we repeatedly told him that specific of our order. Following this we dealt with only the manager and only saw the waiter again for our bill. We ordered dessert from the manager who seemed confused on one of the orders even though we named it word for word. We clarified to be sure. When it arrived it was the wrong flavor of ice cream. Not wanting to be anymore of a hassle for them we kept our mouths closed about it. Following this we probably waited 20 minutes to ask for our check and to then pay. We ended up leaving without leaving a tip. I never do this. But we had no service and when we did something got messed up with little to no apology. I will most likely go back to give it a second chance. Maybe then I will update this review.

So I finally got back to give this place a second try. Before they had just opened so I understood some of the flaws. Now it's been open about 2 years. Upon my second attempt at trying Ginban, I was again thoroughly disappointed. First flaw was the waiter, we could barely understand his mumbling. Second he didn't seem to even know the menu or inventory. We ordered the mango tango, and the king lobster roll, which both featured lobster salad, as we came just for those rolls (we love lobster, who doesn't). However we were informed a while after ordering that they were out of lobster salad (a good portion of their rolls feature this). Thirdly the menu descriptions are not accurate. The waiter wanted informed us about the lobster salad for the mango tango roll and not the king lobster roll. I had to dispute that the King Lobster roll has this as well, which is what the menu states. He then comes back saying that they don't really use it on the roll. Well then why is a King Lobster roll (I don't think the tempura lobster qualifies it as that). Also the menu did not list for one of our rolls had masago. And fourth the food was just meh and we left hungry and went to Sushi Ken down the road for an extra roll each. The Ginban roll, which should be the best since carrying their name, was subpar. This roll was supposed to be cooked, yet the tiny amount of salmon that was inside was raw. The snow something roll must of been called that because it tasted like the ingredients were frozen and not fresh. Other side notes: Ginban had only one other table filled, while just a mile down the road Sushi Ken was packed. When a customer orders their roll on soy paper, they need to be informed of it costing extra, since not every place charges extra. Again thoroughly disappointed and upon a second try, we will not be coming back.
