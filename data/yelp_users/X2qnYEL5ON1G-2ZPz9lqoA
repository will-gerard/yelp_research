$20 for a fuzzy navel? Is that bartender-code for "please don't come back"? The only reason he got my money is because i thought i was paying for my friends's drink also. I found out differently when we got back to our table. I saw plenty of reviews about cheap drinks. Either we don't live on the same planet or i got taken advantage of.

Well my first experience couldn't have been better. One of the flaps in my wheel-well got knocked loose. Whitey's handled it in no time... I'm not even sure i was waiting for 10 minutes. I tried to go back in to pay and he told me there was no charge. Here's hoping they maintain the 5-star rating when i go back for real service.

Thanks for being there for me and being so easy to talk to when my plans changed. My life has been in a major state of flux and it definitely helps when people are helpful and easy to work with. Stay awesome!

I hate shopping for dress clothes. This was my second time in 24 hours, because i blundered into spending way too much on clothes i really didn't want to wear the night before. JCPenney to the rescue. They had a great selection at totally easy-to-swallow prices. Ed and Charles, in the men's department, are totally helpful and really made my task way less obnoxious.

Thanks, Officeteam! I always say Officeteam is the only staffing agency I can recommend, because they're the only one that's ever worked hard to keep me working. I said it again when my friend lost her job. She called the Chandler office and they got her working really fast and they're rolling on with her next assignment. Thanks for being the Officeteam I've always raved about!!
