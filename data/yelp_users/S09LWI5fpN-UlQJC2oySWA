Great food.  I ordered "green eggs n ham" and substituted turkey sausage....it was delish. The flavors went together so well.  I also had a berry smoothie that was good as well.

Very Good place to eat GOOD organic italian food.  The chicken with pasta with capers were great!!! It was a good portion size, but could have used another piece of bread.  I also got the chocolate chip cookie skillet (gluten free) and it was so good!!!! I've never had good, organic italian food!!!

My visit with Dr. Sims, was great!!!  I transferred to her from another Physician that didn't give me the results that I felt I needed.  I chose to go on a student shift where they consult the attending physician after the intake, but I actually saw Dr. Sims each time I came for a visit.  She got right on it to "fix" my situation, without me having to go on a round about way of wasting money and no results.  Based on my experience with Dr. Sims, I have chosen to make her my primary care physician!

So this review is waaaaaay over due.  I hate to give this kind of review, because I hardly do reviews.  When I do they are 5 stars.  We need more places like this, but not if it is going to be at the cost of uncleanliness.    I had a colonic for the first time ever, and the experience was ok.  I didn't really know what to expect. One of my other friends told me that it should be a relaxing experience and they should massage my stomach to help relieve the contents. On a + note, they did massage my stomach with essential oils. I was fascinated about all of the things that we hold in our bodies, that came out .       Like most people who hear about this place, I purchased a Groupon, then once I was there I was bamboozled to get a package deal.  Each time that I went to this place it was always something.  1st of all, I called to make an appointment...and they never would answer the phone, so I would have to leave a message on a generic recording.  Not even a recording that had the business name, directions, hours of operation or anything.  Then, they would take approximately 1-2 days to call back.        So my 1st-2nd visit, the restroom seemed as if it could be remodeled. .. wasn't impressed.        My third visit was better, because they offered me the sauna experience to help the contents come out easier.  I agreed.  The sauna wasn't too bad, and they even had music and magazines to help with the time.  However, I had to use the restroom before I even started the colon hydrotherapy and to my surprise THERE WERE STILL REMAINS....from the previous person. So that I could get comfortable, I CLEANED IT MYSELF with the cleaning agents and toilet brush.  I was too thru with this place by then.    SO I asked the Therapist if they clean before each new guest, she said they did, but they "had been were busy".       So I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU FIND ANOTHER PLACE to get these services done!!!.  I even had another friend to come here after I told her not to and she had a bad experience as well.

This place was actually true to the other yelpers :0 experiences.  They fixed the viruses from my computer and now my computer works like new!!!.  To my surprise, they also fix/take broken printers, old computers AND apple computers.  They even took my yelp check in deal.  I will be back for any other computer needs.
