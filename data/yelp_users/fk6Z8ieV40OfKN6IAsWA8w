I go in to get options on fixing a cracked screen but got the run around. "You can go to apple or this little store down the street and they can fix but I don't know how much" is the answer I received. Left feeling unappreciated as a customer.

Love chipotle and go to this one often since its by my place but usually have a bad experience with the staff. This time however Benjamin (name on receipt/guy with dreads) had the most friendly interaction with myself and the other customers around me. A+

place looked like it had potential. $8 bucks for a slice, salad and drink! Not really a lunch special. Pizza is mediocre at best and salad comes pre wrapped and was soggy (salad bar would help)

If you are advertise to be open until 10p, how about you stay open till 10 not but everything away and cleaning by 915p. Love cafe rio but this location has workers that have a attitude.

Gave this place another try and again was disappointed. The food is just hype ingredients and nothing more. Asked for a side of avocado and when I put it over my eggs it was smothered in lime juice. I informed my waiter and she said it comes like that, asked if I can get another order and was told kitchen is backed up and could take 10 min. Told her never mind since I was already ready to get out of there. Before she brought the check she apologize for her "crappy service and that she never works brunch" (her words) before we got the check.
