So we decided to come here for our fifth anniversary- kinda a big one if you ask me. I will say the food was delicious. We had the squid ink pasta with seafood and also the mushroom pasta with lobster. The food was delicious which is why this review gets two stars. But- I called well in advance to make this reservation, and told them it was a five year anniversary- and we were seated at possibly the worst table in the entire place. Not private, not romantic, in the middle of the restaurant in walk ways. And on top of that, we had our food come out BEFORE our bread basket came out. So imagine you're expecting a wonderful evening out with your fianc√© to celebrate your fifth anniversary, and what you get is some pasta about ten minutes out, served at the worst table in the restaurant. Amazing food Marcellino, I'll give you that. But your customer service and attention to detail is atrocious.

40 minutes, 125 dollars later. Pathetic.   I love to eat out. I am a total foodie and because of that, I've eaten at a lot of places in the valley. Good, bad, everywhere in between. I came here with my mom for Mother's Day dinner. Seemed odd that I had never been. Highly rated on yelp, great patio, and I love LGO so this seemed like a perfect choice. Boy was I wrong.   We felt rushed the entire time. From the minute we sat down at our table with the waitress repeatedly asking if we were ready, until the moment we paid our check took 40 minutes. How is that even possible? Forty minutes for three courses on Mother's Day. It's not like I wanted to spend time with my mom or anything. Our appetizer came out with our soup and our entrees. For entrees priced at over twenty dollars I would rather not be rushed through my meal. I felt like I was at Applebee's.   The food was mediocre, especially for the price. We got a variety of things off the menu including the short rib tacos and pan fried chicken. Both lacked seasoning and I felt like I could have made them at home.   Great ambience especially on a nice day, but if I'm going to pay 20+ an entree I expect better service (or any service at all) and better food. Highly disappointed. The only reason this place got two stars instead of one was the free chocolate chip cookies at the front on your way out.

Great food and great service! Morgan was amazing, very patient with our indecisiveness. Ask for her when you come here! Pizza had a nice char, we ordered the Calabrian. They also have pizza and a pitcher for 25 bucks and pasta and a bottle of wine for 35. Great deals!

Let me start by saying that I use Yelp A LOT. I use it to review all sorts of businesses before I actually go there. However, this is my first review. And I've taken the time to write this particular review because my experience was TERRIBLE.   I went there for a Shellac manicure, and my experience while there was fine. The lady who did my nails was friendly, talkative, she did a great job on my nails, they serve complimentary champagne.   However, the salon is VERY poorly run. The owner has absolutely no idea how to run a small business. To start: their phone's mailbox is always full. And they rarely pick up the phone. So you just have to keep calling and calling until someone actually picks up.   A friend of mine and I wanted to make appointments together so we booked them for last Saturday. We were running late so we called ten minutes before our appointment, and the owner said she was JUST about to call us (ten minutes prior to our appointment) because one of her nail techs called in sick and she wouldn't be able to fit both in. I asked if she could just have us go back to back as opposed to at the same time, and she said that was fine. When we walked in, she said she was running an hour behind (yet failed to mention this to us when we called her) and asked if we wouldn't mind grabbing lunch then coming back. So we did just that, but instead of coming back, we decided to reschedule for the following week.   The morning of our appointment the following week, I got a voice mail from the salon confirming my appointment. I called back and confirmed it JUST IN CASE. About two hours later, I get another call from the salon and this time I pick up. The owner is wondering why my friend and I no-showed our appointment the day before. I told her our appointment was for today, in fact I just got a confirmation call, to which she quite rudely responded that it wasn't, it was for the day before. I told her I had just received a call from the salon confirming my appointment for later that day, and I called back to double check. She, again, quite rudely, told me that was impossible because she was the only one that answered the phone. I said someone else must have answered the phone then because I had just called the salon two hours ago. She put me on hold, then came back and said "oh yes, you're right. See you soon" click.   As I said before, once we FINALLY got our nails done the experience was fine. But administratively, the salon is poorly run. The owner has no idea what she's doing. I was shocked that she was telling me I was lying when I confirmed my appointment, and she wasn't even nice about it! Not to mention this was the SECOND time my friend and I were attempting to get our nails done because of her screw up last week with scheduling. Sure the salon is cute and pink and they offer champagne and movies while you get your nails done. But I'd rather go somewhere without the frills but get treated like a customer should be treated.

This is hands down the best traditional breakfast place in the valley. My boyfriend and I are huge foodies so we have eaten at almost every breakfast place in town. Matt's has the best bacon and hash browns I've ever had. Their bacon is thick-cut, seasoned with maple and black pepper. Their hashbrowns (and probably everything else on the menu) probably have three tablespoons of butter in them, but trust me its worth it. There is usually a wait, so be prepared. But just do what we do and go there anticipating an hour wait, not when you're starving. Sip some cave creek coffee and enjoy the day while you wait. You'll be glad you did!

My first time here and I would come back. I ordered to go, two scoops (salmon and tuna) with half and half (brown rice and salad) with all the toppings. You definitely get more rice and salad if you order to go. That's a HUGE portion. The regular, which is two scoops, is $8.95 and I added avocado for an extra dollar. I got the house spicy sauce which was delicious.   There were a couple aspects of the place that made the overall experience four stars instead of 5. First, the scoops contain four or five 1-1.5" cubes of fish. TINY. So I would recommend getting the large for an extra two dollars. I think all the fillers stay the same portion. I can't imagine my to-go box being any more full. Second, you order chipotle or subway style, as you go down the row. It is nearly impossible to hear one another. I don't know if it's the acoustics but I literally read one woman's lips because after three tries I still couldn't hear her. And the next lady in charge of my sauce options gave me the wrong sauce, likely because she also couldn't hear me. (Still delicious).   As long as you're not expecting a poke bowl a la Hawaii (i.e. All fish) and can shout, and MAYBE stand getting the wrong things in your bowl, this place is fantastic. New fresh healthy food option in the area, definitely try it out!
