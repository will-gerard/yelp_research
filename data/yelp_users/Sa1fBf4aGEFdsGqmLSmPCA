I purchased shoes for my 4 year old that light up a few months ago. Within a month two of the lights went out on his illuminator sketchers and of course I could not find the receipt (although I have a receipt for everything else I have purchased in the last 5 years). Since these shoes were rather expensive I was not a happy camper.   A few weeks ago a woman told me that Famous Footwear is great about returns even without a receipt. I crossed my fingers and took his shoes in to exchange them for a new pair. I was pleasantly surprised when they exchanged the shoes for me without a fuss or dirty look. I really appreciated the understanding given to my situation and the smooth process of exchanging the defective shoes.

Love it. The salsa may not be the best but the Pollo Magnifico makes up for it. Order this dish people it is fantabulous! It is a deep fried chicken burro topped with jalapeno cream cheese (to die for) and tons of melted cheese. I order this dish every single time and although I know it is not good for my diet I cannot resist it.  The Pollo Magnifico never lets me down each time it is delicious and melts in my mouth!

This place is one of a kind. There is a huge outside patio that you can smoke on (and it is air conditioned) there are stripper poles to play and FREE POOL!   The Billet Bar is laid back and there are beautiful, sassy ladies behind the bar. The bartenders are great they remember a face and always make me feel welcome.

I had the Boston Clam Chowder soup in a bread bowl and it was fabulous! The corned beef sandwich was not amazing but the soup made up for it.

The food is always fresh and made to order at Med Fresh. The portion sizes are huge which they should be since the prices are a little high. But they pile it on I like the Mixed Grill which includes chicken and some other meat, humus, pita bread, small salad, and rice. This plate usually lasts me for 2 meals but today I was exceptionally hungry and I ate it all gone. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean.

Great Happy Hour! Wine and bruschetta is the bomb. A great atmosphere and service. We always end up staying hours longer then expected.

I have visited Barrios twice. The first time I met my friend for happy hour. Happy hour is OK nothing spectacular. 2 different wines $4 a glass, domestic beer 3, and house margaritas 4. The first visit I had a glass of wine and ordered one of the happy hour appetizers. The chips and salsa were very good. But when I got the appetizers I could not believe how small the portion was. I was not expecting anything huge but it would have been nice if it filled me up. I ordered ceviche and it was expensive and not great.  Visit number 2 was disappointing. The waitress was cranky and did not keep our drinks or salsa filled. I had a happy hour margarita and it tasted like there was NO alcohol in it at all. We had to flag the waitress down just to get another beer, really. I once again ordered an appetizer from the happy hour menu and there was a problem with it so I sent it back and had it removed from my bill.   All in all for the price I am not satisfied. Each time the bill was $50 and the food nor the drinks were that great. Darn, it is so close to my house to.

I love this place! Every random and weird beer that I look for I find when I visit Total Wine. Dog Fish Head found it and love it. Purple Haze found it and it was good. Very cheap liquor prices too.
