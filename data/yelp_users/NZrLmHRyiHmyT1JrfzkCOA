Once you see Sharron for a pedicure, you will never go anywhere else!  Amazing service, friendly staff, and peaceful atmosphere.  Highly recommend!

My friends and I always joke about the service at Chelsea's and we were willing to deal with it because the food and atmosphere are what we are looking for some days.  I have never had a problem with service on the restaurant side, only at the bar and patio.  I took a first date there on Sunday evening.  We arrived at 5 pm and were just going to get some cocktails and maybe an appetizer.  We sat in the bar area inside. Not at the bar, but at the pub tables.  We were talking, enjoying our conversation and about 10 minutes into our visit, we still hadn't been approached by anyone with a greeting or menus.  We kept talking but now I was trying get the attention of the server.  There were only 2 other people at the bar.  They weren't busy.  Being a first date, I didn't want to make a scene, so I suggested we go somewhere else.  I was still trying to get the attention of the server and/or bartender.  We kept enjoying our conversation and finally, after 33 minutes (I am not kidding) without so much as a "hello", we left and headed for Hillstones.  I was so embarrassed as Chelsea's was my suggestion.  I WILL NOT be giving Chelsea's my business anymore.

Amazing work!!! This my sixth plumber to attempt to unclog a very old pipe in my shower.  Everyone else gave up and told me to remodel.  Ron was in and out and unclogged the drain in less than 10 minutes.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
