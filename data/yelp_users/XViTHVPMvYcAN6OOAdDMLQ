AWFUL. Worst customer service.   While recently in Phoenix and needing some last minute supplies for a an event, I had called this michaels asking for a certain product. While on the phone they assured me that they had "SO MANY". I made sure to specify on the phone exactly what I was looking for and where it was located (I had been to a Michaels right before this that only had 1 out of 3 that I needed) and she said "yes we have a ton of those". I informed here that I would be coming right away to pick up 2. I drove 30 minutes out of my way, during rush hour to pick up said item. I arrived and checked the aisle they were supposed to be on - not there. Ok, no big deal, the other ones at the previous store were also on an end cap. Checked the end cap - none. Ok, not panicking because I already called to make sure, maybe they are in the back. The first woman I asked (if they had them in the back/located somewhere else) had no idea what I was talking about. The woman at the cash register (who was checking others out) then chimed in and said, "oh yeah we have a ton of those!" Im assuming this was who I was previously on the phone with. She advised me to check the aforementioned aisle, I said I had. She then got on her headset to ask someone else where they were. We waited around for about 5 minutes for her to then say "oh we're actually out of them, someone right before you came in and bought them, sorry". -__-

Ive been here a few times, previously when it was the jobbing.com arena and now recently; no complaints here! Staff is always accommodating and helpful if lost. Obviously there are thousands of people in one place but staff is always nice. Seating is great, no matter where you are. Layout is great for concerts/sporting events.

Delicious Toddy! My friend and I grabbed a morning snack with coffee. She had a iced latte that she enjoyed. We also split a Hungarian pastry that was pretty tasty as well! The ambiance is nice and relaxing.

Delicious!! My husband and I shared the pastrami sandwich, with jalepeno cheddar grits, and their bunch of wings. All so great! I was pretty impressed with their bbq sauce and homemade ranch. I like that they make everything in-house. It's a little on the pricy side but well worth it.
