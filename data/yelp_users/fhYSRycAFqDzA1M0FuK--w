Been going to this one and another location for almost 2 years. The employees have always been very knowledgeable, very friendly, energetic and helpful. They're very quick I resolve anything and keep customers happy. Great customer service and smiles!

I don't have a problem paying $60-$80 for two, but when its worth it.  I think if it wasn't ridiculously over-priced it might have been a better experience.  I'm South American, grew up with Caribbean-Latin American food and I've had better.  But if you've never had Cuban, Puerto Rican or any Latin food; then I guess at least try it once.

the sandwich was amazing....but defintiely not worth $9. I've definitely had better.  It didn't even come with a side. great location and outdoor seating, but overrated.

Absolutely recommend it. Great value, experience and happy with results. Even though it was a busy Saturday, I was quickly greeted and sat for a pedicure. I liked that they took their time, unlike some places where one feels they're just trying to get the next one in.

I love the food, but I've had it with online ordering; which is why I'm not giving them 4 or 5 stars. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!!  This is the 5th time they screw up mine and my friends' order. My friend Pre ordered his Steak Bowl from Chipotle this location on 54th street. Which always has a line out the door.   Order: White Rice, Steak, Blk Beans, Pinto Beans, Veggies, Medium Salsa and Cheese (simple)  What he got: Brown rice, Blk Beans, Medium Salsa.  As it was a to-go, we did not notice this until after we got back to the office.

I used to like this bar for being a "neighborhood bar".  A recent situation with a friend showed me that this place is definitely not the type of place which would represent the gay community nor the modern (current 2014) gays.   This is a stagnant old mire of very bitter rotten old men who are very insecure with younger gays. It was sad that we liked this bar for a long time and when the bartender became involved, that confirmed the regular mold clientele.   Definitely not worth it.

This is the BEST place for hangover breakfasts.  Have anything with chorizo in it if you're into spicy.  The servers are friendly and fun.  The place is a bit tight, but bc they've maintained their vintage atmosphere.

Third time I'm at this location in the last three months for pedicures, and highly recommend it. They've update the location a bit since its been under new management and slowly looking better.  They will take their time, they're gentle, and very friendly.   Very, very fairly priced especially since they really take they time. It's obvious they have regulars as they are happily greeted as they walk in; making it more inviting for new customers.

DOG PARK: Just took my dog to the big-dog section. Rather green compared to most other AZ dog parks. Despite some comments, there are 3-4 shaded areas. Great parking, directly in front of the big-dog gated entrance. Only thing is that there's no running water inside, but there's a water fountain for ppl and faucet for dogs. Some ppl have brought in a few buckets, but just in case I brought my own water and bowl.

Many say these drive thru Mexican food (allegedly) all taste the same. Maybe, but Cerritos people are awesome, they have milanesa prepared how u want it.  My favorite: California burrito w/pollo asado!

For Phoenix, this is a pretty sweet stroll with a view of downtown and Phoenix Public Library.  Felt great to get away from all the concrete. The grass felt like luscious British grassy hills.   Although, a bit sketchy since it is downtown and some stragglers here and there. Still felt safe.

One of my new favorite places for Sunday brunch! Their drink specials are awesome, food's always great, service is also above expectations, overall a definite recommendation. Can't go wrong with what you order, whether its a burger, breakfast brunch, huge salads, all of it worth the money without breaking bank.

i'm a HUGE fan of the restaurant and the menu.  i've been eating at various locations in Phoenix, Tucson, and other cities.  This particular location keeps getting worse with servings and if you ask for an extra scoop you get attitude. Management is nice, but they need to work on their employees and serving ammount. my burrito bowls i've gotten lately are for babies.

I work RIGHT by this place and went all the time. Will not be returning due to the poor customer service. One employee was talking to the guy in front of me about parties and hooking him up with a job. I definitely will NOT be going back there and spreading the word.

- definitely a date place, romantic but a bit busy in a fun way - great service and server, fast, attentive, charismatic - GREAT pizza, i say that as a pizza snob - its a bit small, so i wouldn't go there with more than 4-6 (max) ppl
