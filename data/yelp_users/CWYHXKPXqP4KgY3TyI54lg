I had to sleep on this one a few nights. I take a negative review status seriously, and to me a "2" is pretty bad.  The facilities are awesome.  Outdoor bar rocks.  But right away it seemed too loud, which remined me that I may be too old.  30m wait ended up being over 1 hour (Not managing expectations). Spinach Buns were a solid "4"  Yum..  Must have.  Vegge Spring rolls (not fried) were horrible - "1".  It was like eating a shredded Daikon Radish.  There was NOTHING else in them!  Why?  Ordered a chicken thing that was marginal. And a Beef (leather)  thing with noodles. They served a small cup of rice that I thought was amazing.  The steamed rice was a "5" for me.  The beef was remarkably like seasoned leather.  As an amateur chef I sincerely cannot decide what techniques I would employ to make it so tough and flavorless.  It would be hard to reproduce.  Time to get back to basics.  This was no "Flo's" or "Changs". The service didn't suck, but close.  Hoping it was just an off night, but .?

I am rating a 4.5. Today I had the Fennel Sausage Market sandwich that I really didn't expect to like (I've had it once before and wasn't in the mood for it today).      It rocked. Also bought some fresh Pomagranite seeds for my guacamole tonight.  Wish List (Fat Chance) *  Homemade sun-tea *  That Foccia with the olives again please *  Some other option... I eat here a few times a week and want one other option on the menu.

Pane Bianco:  Stuck in a Rut.  I've had all the sandwiches about 50 times each. Dump the Sopprasata please - time for a change.  Bring back more of the Meatballs / Sausage and other bitchin Markets.

Great sit-down style lunch / dinner place.  Had Summer Spring Rolls (not fried thankfully) and they were nice enough to omit the shrimp for my lunchmate.  Tasty to me.  Had some other thing on the Appetizer menu that has a strange name and was $3.00  It was some little dish of veggies and asian sauce... very yummy.  Lunch special we had was Korean Spicy Beef.  Lite dish, not fried, plenty of veggies and perfectly spiced.  The tables always bothered me at CBNC.  The "2-tops" always seem crowded with the little lamp and the box of spices and chop sticks, etc.  I always feel like I am going to knock the entire table over.

My stand-by easy night for dinner and a drink spot.  I prefer to sit at the bar with Tammy and have a salad and a burger, or maybe the Chicken or Beef Kabob (Ask for it dry "no butter").  Also love the Chili and the Fried Shrimp.  Ask for extra mushrooms is yummy to me.  Furthermore, the Thursday BBQ special rocks (but split it with someone as it is huge).  The Friday night Fish and Chips is delicious.  Not a fan of Liver and Onions ever so I wouldn't order it.  Sometimes the salads can be pretty heavy on dressing.    Biggest gripe = I used to order my Vodka Tonic, till I found out they use an "Absolute 100" vodka or something similar that is 100 Proof.  In my opinion it is totally wrong to serve somebody  a "100" vodka versus the normal "80".  It is the same as ordering a rum and coke and getting Barcadi 151 rum instead.   A totally different product.  Can you tell this is an issue for me?  Otherwise one of my favorite watering holes for sure.  Nice people too.

Local deli, locally owned.  Small little place tucked in a strip mall behind the A&J BBQ about a quarter mile north of Bethany Home on the West side of 16th Street.  Love their sandwiches.  Never had the pizza.  Love the Italian cheese and desert treats selection.  Love the small but densely packed shelves of canned and bottled cooking materials.

The store near Bell and 7th St. was filthy. The employee making the pizza obviously had a cold or sniffles or something.  Repeatedly touched his face and handled the food.  My slice of pizza was very good. But the utensils were all soiled, the tables were dirty, windows dirty, etc.  Been to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times.

I took my 1988 Mercedes 560 SEC into DynoComp today to get a baseline dyno run with Air/Fuel evaluation.  The guys at DynoComp could not have been nicer.  They were all enthusiastic, professional and obviously motorheads.  They spent an hour with me doing some basic tuning on my ancient CIS-E fuel injection and allowed me to make some tweaks.  Its pretty easy to get snotty when you work on REALLY high end cars.  But there was not a hint of snotty at  this place.  Or else they were on their best behavior.  This is a shop I can see coming back to for other services besides dyno tune.  Their techs had all the good equipment and they seemed to be having fun.  Thanks guys.

Based on this previous review I called Cheshire Cat and talked to the owner Paul about a termite track I found.  He gave me a free tip to help see if they were new or old and they were old.  However I said come on out anyways and take a look. He looked and found a new tube nearby and showed me a LIVE termite hiding in a mud-tube.  Yes... I'll take that treatment now...  Paul came out and did the treatment as advertised. He was polite, clean, knowledgeable and fast.  Recommended highly. Tj

I think this is maybe 4.2 Stars. Good Sushi, CLEAN place.  Turnover?    I ventured to Tokyo Lobby based on good YELP reviews. It is in a nice strip mall in Glendale with plenty of parking, a nice patio, clean clear windows and signage.   Greeted quickly when we walked in and quickly seated at the sushi bar.    The place is clean.  The have GOLD STARS from the Health Department and it shows.  Yes, I check.  Regularly.  They have a good record and it shows.  The bathroom was clean too, no issues.  Not bad for late on a Friday night.  Sushi:  I am a fairly experienced sushi person. I found the sushi to be fresh, well cut and tasty.  Seared Albacore with scallions - YUM. Fresh Salmon - YUM. Also had tasty Uni, A very nice Albacore Sashimi Presentation and some other yummy stuff including a surprise Jalapeno Popper type thing.  THE PROBLEM?? Starter salad - Dressing good, Lettuce Old (wilted).  Somewhat hard to communicate with the sushi chef because the sushi bar seats are low and it is a little noisy.    The regular clients are probably more into simple sushi (rolls) than fine sushi / sashimi.  Our patricular sushi chef was very experienced, and very creative.  However he made it clear that he has worked at better sushi bars in is life, and was soon moving out of town.    NOTE to PROfessionals of all types:  ALWAYS be a pro.   You are "on-stage" at all times.  Be a PRO or go home.  For a small local spot, I was impressed.

Loved it.  They've been in this spot 20 (twenty) years~! Clean, modern design.  Stainless steel tables, color coordinated chairs, white table cloth & walls and black ceiling.  I used to feel guilty about giving out 5 stars, but not any more. If I really liked it, and I really think my friends should try it = 5 stars.  Food I had was great, place was great, exceeded my expectations = 5 stars. *  Amazing egg roll had lots of fresh veggies and a hint of black pepper. *  Lettuce wraps were just as they should be, fresh with crunchies, crisp lettuce and a tasty sauce. *  Clay Pot Chicken with Asian Eggplant.  Hot (temperature) and perhaps a bit  "oily" for my dining companion (not me).  It was a lot more than I expected.  The staff was small and friendly and they had REALLY COLD BEER... yum.  Lived in Phoenix a long time and this was my first time here. Will return soon.

All you can eat (A.Y.C.E) or order off the menu. I am a big sushi fan and normally won't do anything "all you can eat"  but this was a great spot.  "Park", the sushi chef, even let us order some things that weren't on the regular AYCE menu.  Cold beer and several Sake choices both cold and hot.  Will be back for sure.

I'm an easy grader, I know. But I loved the place, remined me of being in Mexico.  Pouring rain, ambient lighting inside, great food and nice people.  I had a plate of 3 little tacos: Barbacoa, Carne Asada and Pastor. Very tasty, and the double corn torilla ensures they behave as they should.  Rice and beans on the side - properly seasoned. REAL beans - not lard beans.  Actual beans, made by hand I am sure.  Good ice tea. Clean, well lit and a nice clean bathroom.

This Chuy's has moved to a brand new location at 830 E. Greenway. Just East of 7th St. on the North side of Greenway.  You know why Chuy's is a great place?  The food is good, the service is good, the new location is clean and well lit.  Everytime I go there they smile and say Hello.  When I leave they say goodbye.  I actaully think they mean it.    Chips and salsa all you can eat. Margaritas are actually one of my favorites. The new  "Street Tacos" are fantastic. The beans and rice are healthy and taste good.  And my absolute favorite part... they open early 7 days a week.  Good clean service.  That's what makes a business successful.

My new office by Deer Valley Airport and the food truck drove by for 3 days before I went in for a try.  Pretty darn good. Had 2 steak tacos (street style) that were very good.  One chicken taco that was tasty, just not really my style.  Will try the pork next.  They have several really great salsas. Will be eating here a lot!

Disappointing experience.  #1:  They ran out of carbonation for cocktails.  No soda, no tonic. Their Carbon Dioxide generator quit.  I asked why they don't use Schweppes bottles.  Answer:  The machine is a lot cheaper she said.  I came expecting to pay top dollar for top shelf drinks and this was annoying.  Hanny's and AZ88 and others use fancy Schweppes bottles, why the skimping here?  #2:  I ordered an $18 Kobe burger.  I know its a steak place, but I figure a steak place should be able to make a decent burger.  I was wrong.  "Kobe" burger was a machine-formed patty on an uncooked onion bun with a pickle and some batter-coated fries.  Denny's has a better burger.  It was very less than marginal.  A high end steakhouse should KILL a burger!  Had the burger at St. Francis earlier this week.  WOW..  That's a burger!  Its neat inside and I the steak I tasted next to me was great. Service was good.

Another review of Barrio? Yea, why not.  5 of us went tonight. They had a special Margarita with a great tequila, simple with only lime juice and triple sec or something.  Very dry and yummy ($11).  Tableside Guac is fantastic with the pomegranite seeds and also the Queso Fundido (sp?).  The Queso Fundido is a little bit of work to eat as the cheese tends to be a bit stringy.  You have to just go right for it and show no fear.  It is quite good.  I ordered the Conchinita Pibil Tacos (roasted pork) which were great.  They come with a starter salad or french fries.  I had the salad and loved it, great dried cranberries in it.  Hard to explain to people why they are having a salad or french fries at an upscale white table cloth "mexican" restaurant.  But it works.  My tacos do conchinita pibil (pork) were great, with a little Casera cheese (a treat).   There are 4 small tacos so I got to trade with my brother who had the fish tacos which I thought were even better than the pork.    My partner had the Enchiladas Mole (a favorite).  But in truth, I may be bored with this dish.  I thought it was a bit dry, and lacked flair.  Not sure what it is, but it just seemed flat.  Was like that the last time I went also.  I love the Mole sauce, but the enchilada itself was boring.  Oh, and the second margarita was even better than the first.  Service is cocky, maybe even strict at times, and very pleasing overall.  They know what they are doing and you can trust them.  Was a bit noisy tonight, as there isn't much sound deadening.    I honestly can't stand it when they have live music - ditch that.  If you haven't been, it is a must.  Parking:  Sucks.  Bring your friends car, park out back and don't worry about it.

If you sit at the sushi bar the sushi is pretty darn good. Service is pretty darn good as well.  What's with all the guys in the flower embroidered button down shirts?  (Hint to guys in Scottsdale trying to pick up chicks... ease off on the embroidery and throw on a pair of shoes and socks.)  Anyways, they have good sushi at the sushi bar, did i mention that?  Remember rule #1 of sushi - it is ONLY AT THE SUSHI BAR. I suppose you can order rolls at a table, but don't expect greatness (rolls aren't sushi anyways).  Oh and the girl next to me had a huge bowl of fried rice that looked amazing.  I'm sure the cooking tables are tasty too, hard to screw that up.  They are open late night and serve food late which is fantastic.  Easy parking, good food, good drinks.  Worth a visit.

A hidden gem?  Perhaps.   I expect good food in vegas but all the fancy places were 2hr wait.  Found ichiban in the basement of ballys.  Tamago was excellent Salmon and a few rolls great . Then I had some perfect Uni. Then we tried a wonderful gindara (cod) Finally I was treated to some of the best hamachi belly ever.   I am a sushi snob and I will be back.

Cool bar.  Killer tunes. Some people say it is weird.  Thankfully, that is true.  It is basically a dive bar, but is freshly remodeled.  Doesn't smell like smoke and has a hipster crowd.  The bathrooms are AMAZING.  Spotless, comfortable and clean as could be.  A nice touch these days.

Pizzeria at LGO. Very comfortable seating. I especially like sitting at the "Chef's Table" and watching the action. Salad came out quickly and was good. Ice Tea was great and a cold beer was tasty. Pizza came out quickly (thankfully as I was hungry). Pizza was tasty and fun, look forward to trying other ones.  Certainly was Bianco good, but better than CPK / similar to Cibo.  I was (and always will be) disappointed they don't have a full bar.  In fact I wish the beer selection was larger, but what they do have is good. (Stella, Hefe, etc..)  Parking can be tricky, so Valet, or snoop a spot and deal with it.  Will be back for sure.

COURTESY 4. I wish I could rate a 3.8 for this meal.  Primarily for 2 reasons: 1)  No Patatas Bravas??? I spent 2 weeks in Spain and at Patatas Bravas EVERY DAY~ 2)  Lack of  a more full bar. Although Vino Tinto is a very Spanish drink.  The menu is a wee bit limited. However, the Tortilla (Spanish) was great, as was the Puerco a la plancha, Garbanzos and Spinach was tasty.  The Jamon and Sarrano was good, but maybe too much "Antipasto" style for me.  The Pot-de-Creme was very very rich and thick. I personally like a more "mousseY" pot-du-creme. Personal preference.  Service was excellent; quick , accurate and cheerful. Drinks were great, ambiance perfect.  Highly recommended (expecially once they have Patatas Bravas back). Whats up with no Patatas Bravas???  (Did I mention that already?)

I went again with my partner for our second time there.  We sat with "Yasu" of Yasu and were treated to a killer sushi dinner.  I am an advanced sushi eater, I eat sushi 4 to 10 times a month and spend a lot of money doing so.    Negatives?  Nothing is perfect, perhaps the sushi bar is a bit small (4 seater) but totally intimate.  I also wish I could see through the glass to watch what they are making.  Positivse?  Full bar and some serious Umami.

Bad experience.  I am not going to be told what will be installed in my eyes. They are mine and I know a bit about them too.    They wanted to make a dramatic change to my prescription and I wanted to try something a little more mild.  I had to walk out and didn't pay and won't return. I need to find a higher caliber of eye-doc that will respect my input also and help craft a best solution together. Nationwide won't do that.

My experience was not so great.  I ordered a Carne Asada burrito to go, and it was bad. Smelled like old (rancid) grease from a grill that hadn't been cleaned in years.  Threw half away.  Minor bathroom problems the next day.  I think I will skip this one next time. Need to do some serious cleaning.

As much as I love Carolinas, I got sick for the 2nd time recently. A breakfast burrito (Chorizo and egg) which looked a little grey, but tasted good.  I wasn't horribly sick (like what happened the time before), but it was enough. I can't go back.  At least for a year or two until I forget.  I just worry sometimes that things happen so fast in there is the quality and cleanliness always what it needs to be.  I have eaten at the Cactus store 100 times and sick twice is too much. Still great food and a great spot, just need them to be more careful.

I have thought long and hard about this. I have tried the French Onion Burger (FOB) 3 times now.  I say this:  It is the best burger I have ever had.  That is a very difficult ruling to reach, but I am ready for it.  I have a few other issues with the place;   *  service seems preoccupied with life's other details and not totally "in the brand". *  a few mis-steps from the kitchen (FOB #1 overcooked), (fries undercooked) - But in each case they made it right instantly.  The FOB is the best burger I have ever had.

HANA IS B.Y.O.B. (And bring some extra to share~!)  My friends at Hana Japanese Eatery kick up some killer sushi.  I spend a LOT of money on sushi and I am a "foodie".  I am a fairly advanced sushi eater and can be trusted (You agree B?)   I only gave 4 of 5 stars for the following reasons in order of importance:   #1:  Nobody is perfect so a 5 star just ain't gonna come out of me. (read between the lines). #2:  I wish they had a bar, but I don't mind bringing my own.  Did somebody say "Family run, locally owned, neighborhood friendly?"  Yeah, I think this is the thing.  If you really like sushi, give this a try, sit at the bar and ask KOJI (Rick) to give you all he has.

I've been here a few times now and I really like it.  The food was good and the service couldn't be any nicer.  Today I had a Spring Roll (Grilled Pork) and it was great, I like them because they aren't just fried like an eggroll.  Then I had a special bbq pork with a meatball noodle thing.  She showed me how to eat it and I chowed the whole thing down.  I definitely think it is worth a try. Closed on Mondays.

For true Sushi fans in Phoenix that remember  Ayako (Akita-Ya) at the Biltmore, they are now known as "Shiro Japanese Restaurant".  With a combined 70 YEARS of professional sushi experience the same folks from Ayako at the Biltmore are now at Shiro Japanese at Tatum and Shea.  Located next to "My Big Fat Greek" place at the northeast corner of Tatum and Shea, they have some of the most traditional and trustworthy sushi in town.    Ask Hiro for Special Salmon, Agedashi Tofu, wonderful and rare fish selections you might not find elsewhere.    Tonight I started as I usually do with Albacore, Salmon sushi, Yellowtail belly, and the Mackerel was recommended.  They have a full bar and some great Sake and Beer selections.  You may not find the run-of-the-mill "Oscar-Meyer" rolls here, but you will find only the finest sushi.    My "wish list" to make the place even better? 1)  Turn the lights down a little, make it more cozy like Ayako was. 2)  Music needs to be more exciting. 3)  Modernize the traditional sushi.  Some of the people I take here want a little more "flair" to the sushi.  These guys have been around a long time and need the support of sushi lovers like ourselves.

Have returned to Shiro about 5 times since my first review.  Continues to be exceptional quality and trusted techniques. Hiro and the rest of the crew (many from the fabled "Ayako Biltmore) are the most experienced and seasoned sushi chefs in the valley.  It isn't cheap, quality never is.

Q:  Is it good?   A:  Yes!  Q:  Is it REALLY worth trying?   A:  Oh yeah, for sure.  Q:  I heard it is in a scary neighborhood? A:  Oh yeah, for sure.  Q:  Why did you give it 5 stars?    You are too easy! A:  I give 5 stars if it really exceeded my expectations and I plan to return right away.  That is my criteria.  Any restaurant whose proprietor serves my dinner and drinks a beer in the back is high on my list.  BYOB FYI & a 7-11 nextdoor will help you out.  We split a Cesar salad that I thought was a little heavy on dressing.  I also like a slightly more creamy cesar dressing.  Preference.  We split the Antipasto and I thought it was light, flavorful and refreshing.  My partner found it a little simple.  Perhaps I agree.  But the Proscuitto was outstanding.  Just like Italy or Spain.  We split a pizza with a refreshingly light crushed tomato sauce, sausage and Rapini.  False advertising really as the Rapini is brocolli.   Mauro...  we need Rapini!!  Please!  Then we split a Tiramisu which can be dangerous with all those sharp little forks swinging around devouring such a yummy dessert in the desert.  What a fun treat that place is.

Lunch at Two Hippies today. This is a 4 star with comments.  1)  5 stars for small business, new ventures, private companies. It isn't easy, been there and done it.  2) 4 Stars for location.  Perfect location, very fun. No bathroom?  Not even a place to wash the salsa off your hands? If it is there I didn't find it.  3) 4 stars for food:  Great Green chile beef burrito. But it was a "busy" like I could get at a chain store. Why do we have to have rice and beens in everything? Carbs yuk.    2)  1 star  for No Ice Tea.  No Ice Tea?  Will go back this week for sure.

I eat Beef!  I love the stuff. Especially Carne Asada and today I had America's Carne Adada. It rocked.  Especially with the addition of a little lime juice that the Carne Asada comes with.  Cute little place with a no-nonsense menu. They make what the like to make and are good at it. Don't need anything else.  Support local business, America's is on my list.

I had a poor experience and maybe it was an off day.  Problem: Sticky toilet valve and leaky base.  When the tech arrived I showed him the valve and I was told 'We don't stock those parts, will have to be special order'.  Ok, I thought, I can do that myself but its a really common Home Depot Kohler toilet...?  Moving on.  Then we started talking about the leaky base and 1st thing, the tech tells me "As a company policy" they don't do the solicone base after resetting the toilet.   Really?    Ok, but everyone else caulks around the bottom of the toilet after they reset.  But fine again so we move on.  Remove toilet and he "discovers" the base flange is corroded and nothing can be done (I already knew this and tried to explain over the phone when I made the appointment).   He said there was nothing he could do except cut the concrete and replace the pipe for $1K.  Really?  He said everything had to be to "Code".  Toilet code?  So he left, I had to pay $100 bucks and got zero service except a removed toilet.  I went to Home Depot  and bought the gasket for $4.89, Ring for $12, the flange repair sleeve for $26 and a tube of sealant for $4.00 and fixed it myself in 20 minutes.

Great spot.   Finally a breakfast spot you can actually get in to (so far).  Had a spicy breakfast burrito that was great. And the spicy eggs benedict thing that I really liked, although the sauce was spicy. Also had a Hash Browns thing that was awesome. And some turkey sausage that was tasty, but the look and texture was funny.    Fast service, tons of food and a great location.

Drove up and walked in to Postino on Friday afternoon. I walked in and they were happy to show me around.  The place looks fantastic.  As a fan of the former Katz deli I was happy to see they kept some of the original feel.  But clean, modern and very hip.  What a great addition to the neighborhood. When they finish adding a Pizzeria, Market and Bar in that little corner I will be stoked.  Thanks for the recommendation on Taco Tote also! Tj

I have eaten at various Chuy's locations for about 20 years. I will eat at Chuy's about 5 times in the next 7 days.  Street Tacos are awesome.   I like to order 2 Street Fish and 2 Street Pork tacos. I love the Street Shrimp, but they come with nasty lettuce so I order cabbage instead.  The Chicken Fajitas rock, Margy's rock.   Its just a great place to eat. Day or Nite.

I eat at this Chuy's store nearly every day of the week. Fresh food made well with a great staff.  Now they are potentially out of a job and that kinda sucks. Rules are rules, too bad the management didn't manage that better.  Come back Chuy's!

Friday April 22, 2011. My Chuy's at Greenway is back open! New kitchen staff...    I had the Chicken Fajitas and they were the best ones I have had there.  The employees seemed very releived to see the regulars back in.

No mas pollo. Went to this Chuy's location for lunch today and it is closed.  Note on the door regarding Landlords rights.  Never was a really happening location.  Not sure what the other stores are up to, but this location is done.

Unpleasant last few experiences at GB recently specifically with the hostess.  Open bar at kitchen, yet they won't let anyone sit there.  Same situation on last 3 visits.  Some situation between kitchen, servers, customers?    Walked out this time in favor of LGO. Hope this gets resolved because the food generally rocks.

Several months after walking out of Gallo Blanco I cautiously returned and was very pleased to find a totally different atmosphere.  * Cheerful, attractive and helpful host?                Check! * Efficient, attentive and pleasant staff?               Check! * Great food and comfortable atmosphere?       Check!  Nice work.

This place is a home-run.  I knew as I walked in the door.  Archtecture is killer.  Barternder is a pro (known him from other places).  Food was fantastic, and very reasonably priced.  If you like like AZ88, anything from Craig DiMarco, Hanny's, Anything from Chris Bianco... you will love this new restaurant.

I didn't really "get it". I was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats.  *  Bar was great. *  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic. *  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome. *  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they don't neem much more than salt and time).  Awesome location. Menu will expand I am sure. Repaint the bathroom please.

Great spot, totally met my expectations. Clean and nice, with a very friendly staff. Food and drinks came out VERY promptly.  I had a half-order of Vietnamese Spring rolls.  They were very good. Also had a rice dish with charbroiled steak. Healthy and tasty.  Everyone else was having Pho and I should have tried that.  I will absolutely be back. Thats a tough business and they are doing a great job.

An ancient compressor (Chrysler 1973) on my older A/C unit failed.  Mark came out in the evening and went straight to work diagnosing the failed part just to be sure it was dead.  He tested everything and indeed it was dead.  Every other contractor just looked at it and supposed it was dead.  Mark actually tested the power, grounds, caps etc.  He gave me a very competitive written proposal for repairs.  In the end I used another provider due to a very long relationship with that person (but at a higher price).    I would use and recommend Mark again at any time.

The NEW America's Taco Shop  opened today and I was the first most #1 customer.  As usual I had the Carne Asada Torta and it was fantastic.  So good in fact that I went back and got a Carne Asada Burrito to go for dinner (which also makes me the first repeat customer).  Great new location on 7th Ave just south of Campbell.

Based on Faith A's review I made the drive over to 67th Ave and Indian School and found this busy little taqueria in the corner of a strip mall.  The people working there were extremely nice and wanted to help. I read through the menu and decided on a red-chile burrito and a taco.  But I asked about a yummy looking folded taco-thing and he said it was their "Quesadilla" and I should try one.  It was amazing, with carne asada.. Their quesadilla is different, the whole thing reminds me more if an Indian Fry Bread contraption with a thick crusty tortilla, lots of meat and the cheese was fresh crumbled Mexican Cheese with a light white cool sauce.  It was delicious.  I also had 2 mini tacos, one Pastor and one Carnitas. I can't remember which is which but one was more shredded pork and i really liked that.  Bummer:  they don't have real ice-tea.  Oh well. They do have a good salsa bar with a red and green salsa and a bunch of veggies (not quite as big at Taco Tote).  If you are on the hunt for Taquerias in Phoenix this is for you.

A delicious serving of Hangover Helper!  Great spot once again. Had 2 Carnitas Tacos, and 2 Pastor tacos.  Those were the highlight. Also had the Quesadilla de Maiz again de Carne Asada (wish it didn't have lettuce). And a chicken burrito.  The pork is insane. Kinda rough inside, but great food.

It IS the best burger in Phoenix.  But the drunk idiots at the end of the bar ruin the ambience for me.  Two occasions and both times, D.I.s standing, yelling and partying right by the front door.  Not my thing.  But that Sweet / Spicy burger is insane.  Don't take it from me.  I still remember a prominent local restraunteur who also happens to have one of the top 3 burgers in CenPho said:  "I dream about it at night".

Where to begin? The staff is cold and uninviting.  Rolling eyes at the inconvenience of patrons trying to navigate past servers, searching various corridors trying to find the bathroom.  Design / architecturally is fine.  Very current.  The atmosphere at the bar was horrendous.  Vulgar.  Drunks.  If you are a twice divorced post-middle age slightly overweight dude.... this is your place.  Enjoy.

I have very little faith in chain restaurants.  Panda Express lunch was really bad. Noodles - overcooked, choppy, wasted, flavorless.  I chose a "Grilled Chicken" which was 70% chicken fat bits with a few pieces of some kind of breast or muscle like tissue.    Grilled steak something with some vegetable was leather.  Its just not good. Fact is there ain't nothing good to eat in 85027 unfortunately.

Decided to try something different for dinner this Saturday and made a reservation at Iruna.        Excited to try some Tapas, I ordered a variety of cold and hot dishes.  They came out quickly and were all very tasty.  Patatas Bravas is my favorite food EVER!       Liquor was on the menu for this Saturday night and I had a nice Spanish beer, followed by a well made Gin drink.  Table guests all enjoyed their drinks as well including a really fantastic martini looking drink.        Tapas is a food we need more of in the USA.  My visit to Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities in Spain in 1990 introduced me to this wonderful food.  I still yearn for a "Tapas Bar" like they have all over Spain.       Architecturally Iruna was terrific.  A touch noisy inside but generally a great layout with a killer outdoor patio.        Coctails now flowing and fresh Tapas every few minutes... what more could a person want!  Unfortunately the "Tortilla Espanola" was 86'd.  Will have to come back for that soon.    My only complaint, the pork loin (Lomo) was a bit dry.         Healthy food is not only about ingredients and technique, but also portion control.  We were all happy to share a few smaller plates and not have to waddle out the back door.       Iruna is a great addition to the Phoenix scene, cant wait to try their other restaurant.   ITB.

The best Roast Beef sandwich I've ever had. Just stumbled upon the place looking for a bite to eat.   Need to try again.

Excellent Yelp Choice. I called when my toilet began to flow backwards (Yikes!),     he came 30 minutes later, took his time and fixed my problem. Clean work, quick and efficient without being rushed.  Can't go  wrong with Fox Plumbing.  Thanks for the help.

Great new North Central spot. Nice bar and a good food menu in the location what used to be an old car garage.  Strong drinks and good looking food. Good parking. Lights a little bright in the mens room.  Can't wait to try all the stuff on the menu. Thanks for putting a new spot in North Central.

Its a Five.  Tried it twice and still hungry for more.  Dan, the proprietor, is a great taco ambassador.  Had several different tacos, like the Pastor most.   Tried lots of other stuff and it was great.  Small business at its best. Ice Tea is soon to be on the menu I am assured..., ya?

Russell from Infinite Air installed an entire system in a ground-up remodel house I purchased.  There was a minor airflow distribution problem that needed to be corrected after move-in and once I made an appointment with the office, Russell showed up on time and fixed the problem.  I will definitely use him again in the future.  He owns the company and seems extremely competent and capable of doing the job right.

Came here for a quick beer the first day after they opened. Ice cold beer and quick serice.  Came last night for a snack and a drink. Cool beverages reasonably priced and quick service.  I had the Carne Asada tacos and they were fantastic. Meat was tasty and very well seasoned and prepared.  Great chips.  Whats not to like?

A darn good burger today..  Cooked perfectly. That secret extra spicy sauce in the back is great, don't hide that.  Service is great.  A little heavy on the "everything ok" inquiries.   Its fine to ask at the end.  During meal usually people will signal if they need something, either verbally or non-verbally.  I'll be back for more.

Our old kitty needed a vet visit but going to the Dr. is very stressful.  Found Vet to You on Craigslist, and made an appointment for the next day. Dr. Gilchrist and his Tech showed up promptly the next morning and conducted a full exam and treatment right on our house.  Kitty is much happier than she would have been.   Pricing was comparable to the large vets in town and 1000x more convenient.

A year later our 18 year old kitty was ready to move on. We scheduled another appointment with Dr. Gilchrist and Alex and as usual they showed up on time and ready.   It was very tough for us, and akward for them I am sure, but they handled everything professionally and efficiently.  All thumbs up, Thank You!

Excellent service from a Professional that has devoted his life to this career path.   My "exam" was more of a review and consulting of vision and I was able to choose the ultimate best outcome without pressure or shame.  Thanks "Joe-L" for being an optical Superman!!

Still my favorite place in town.   I just cannot eat enough of the pork tacos. Inca salad is fantastic.  Recently fell in love with the chicken soup.  It just a solid spot.

Moving into a new home the last 2 weeks and my lower back was toast. By this morning I could barely get out of bed. I checked Yelp and found "The Joint" close to my work with excellent reviews and I was at their door the moment they opened... Behind several other repeat customers.   I was with the Doc maybe 15 minutes later and we discussed my situation and he could see I was very tender and in serious discomfort (pain).   He made a few small adjustments and I was 1000% better instantly.  Back is still sore from the work and overuse but I was able to short hike this afternoon.  So much better.   Thank you!!!

My Truck had a major blowout and was damaged. ProDiesel quickly found the problem and worked with my insurance company to repair damages.  They also suggested a few other services (serpentine belt, rear axle grease, oil change) which were all completed on time and in budget.  I had some additional concerns about a few items which they explained were normal for this truck and not worth repairing.  I would trust and recommend them to others.

Maybe it was a 4.5...   Disclaimer: I know the owner.    I also know they put a TON of work and $$ into rebranding the business and today was my third visit and it was great.    I had the lunch special of small salad and 8" pizza.  The House Salad was perfect size (perhaps needed a pinch of salt or some olives?).  I had the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and devoured it.  Sitting at the bar with great company looking at the great selection of libations.  Really liked it.  The staff was outgoing and friendly.  I'm a fan!

OMG how is it even possible I work 5 minutes away, crave Bahn Mi DAILY, and only today found out about this amazing spot?  Had the #2 BanhMi with fried Egg which I loved and tried the #7 which was great, but I like the yummy Pate' a little more.    Also tried the Spring Roll which was great and the Salmon Spicy roll which was pretty good.  But just save room for lots of amazing Banh Mi.   I will be back a lot..  It gets busy so go early.

Tav is all refreshed and has some great food. The Carnitas tacos are excellent. Fish tacos yummy. Great chips and salsa, burgers and sandwiches.     To me it still feels like a "bar" and I wish it was a little brighter and more open. That great view of the runway and all.   Coming along nicely!

Big fan of the flour tortillas.  Yummy.  The cheese in the tacos is maybe a little overboard, but tasty.  I wish there was a smaller option for chips / guac for a single person dining alone.  Shredded Chicken is awesome.  The sweet pork was... too sweet for me.  Love the salsas and the salad dressing stuff.  Wish you had fried fish tacos all the time.  Ok BIG pet peeve.... the singing is juvenile.  This shouldn't be a Chuck-E-Cheese or Applebees.  Knock that off.  Its embarrassing to us professional food snobs and makes me not want to be there when it happens.  Please reconsider that.  Its degrading to the employees too imo.    I really wanted to give a 1 or 2 based on the singing alone.
