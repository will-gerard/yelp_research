Homeology has a lot of great and interesting items. Ryan and Chris are great people. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about the different products that they sell. I really recommend this location.

Horrible. I was here with my kids a month and a half ago. Had extra baskets of chips, no charge. Meat was cooked to perfection when I ordered und fajitas. Kid's good was good. Tonight, not so much. Charged for everything extra without warning. Cheese, chips, salsa. Meat very over cooked. Hardly any meat whatsoever. So, meat should not be crunchy.   Staff should've explained that they charge for everything. I tried calling them for over an hour to get hours and it was a constant busy signal. I mentioned it to them and they acted like it was no big deal.   My wife wants to try it and I am going to tell her never again. She would not be impressed at all.   My recommendation is to go to another Mexican restaurant that has much better food. Taco Bell for instance. Jalapeno Inferno would be ten times better. Maybe even Blanco. If you want to try this place, wait till they close and something else opens in its place.
