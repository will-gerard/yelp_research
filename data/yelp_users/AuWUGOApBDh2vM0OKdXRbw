Been going here for about 20+ years now, still has the Best Roast duck in the state.  Always come here for a whole roast duck and roast pork and bbq pork.  As good as it gets in arizona.  :)

loved this place!  sat at the sushi bar by Danny, and a lovely couple sat next to us and were long time patrons.  ordered the special soft shell crab, lobster roll, scallop, primo roll, spicy ninja roll...  all were incredible, faves were the soft shell crap, and spicy ninja.  we got samples of the squid salad from our new friends and of the salmon skin roll... oh wow... salmon bacon!   very good place, but get there early!

Went back to try the dim sum here last sunday, havent been here in 2 years..  Wish I wouldve stayed away..  the food was ok, Good overall for arizona, But the choices and lack of food really was a turn off. It was about 1245, not late by dim sum timing, but they were already wiped out of all food.  We TRIED to order more.. there just wasnt anything to order! I am Chinese and very used to having to chase down the carts for food when they are busy, but this was silly. The tripe was definitely a unique style, and the chicken feet were pretty tasty.  About all I can say about the food.  I will stick to Phoenix Palace for the east valley...

My wife and I come here a lot, I grew up eating sunday dim sum in the valley, and being chinese, i didnt really have a choice back then! lol..  They have a lot of the traditional dishes you see at all of the other dim sum restaurants in arizona, and more!! my favorite is jia leung (sp) breakfast donut wrapped in rice noodle with a sweet soy dressing and scallions..  SO  GOOD!!

Hands Down my favorite Viet restaurant in the valley, The Bun bo Hue is the best! great lemongrass layers in the broth, the pork blood is a great authentic touch, gotta have it.  I also get the pho noodles in this one, instead of the thicker vermicelli thats traditional with Bun Bo Hue, but i like the wasy the thinner noodles pick up the soup!  Also try the Beef stew with egg noodle!  WOW  my fave comfort food at this place

Went here last night with family and the food was great!  rolls were very good, we had the Arizona, dragon, soft shell crab, and cal roll with baked scallops.  All were very good, and you cant beat the prices here.  My wife had the yaki udon noodle dinner, that was ok.  Thats the only reason why we gave 4 stars.  But hey, this is a sushi bar.  Will def. be back and soon!

stopped by here on a Thursday around 5ish.  Grabbing a bite for take out and to have a quick beer with a buddy.  Beer was good, thats about it.  Had the chicken Vesuvio,   2 pieces of chicken, one was a bone in half breast piece.  the other was a flattened breast piece.  looked like they ran out of vesuvio and let me have a marsala piece for replacement.  horrible..

I gotta admit, this place was a nice find. 4.50 for a bowl of Pho, with meatballs, brisket, and tripe.  The broth wasnt the best Ive had, but for 4.50 you cant go wrong!   I noticed the menu is different from the online menu, it looks like they are missing a lot of the items listed online.  Also  the Pho is a Flat $3.00 a bowl now with no small or large.  The Flat $3.00 is just for broth and noodles, you add the meats you want for .50 per meat. We also tried the Banh Xeo, This was the star of the day for us, really yummy. Will definitely be back When we are near Mekong for the weekly shopping.  The Best value in AZ for Pho and Viet food, hands down!!

This location is clean.. but the food almost has a taste of the cleaner that they use.  I live right by this location, but drive the extra distance to the Ironwood location just to avoid that chance of getting a pine sol tasting burro.

Came here last night, had about a 20 min wait.. well worth it!  Crablegs were plentiful, and all of the buffet items were full and very hot! This place is better than pacific, doesnt have all of the items of pacific, but they dont ration out the crablegs , and the food items they do have are better tasting! And the dinner price is 12.95!

This place is the BEST!  My wife and I tried the Pad thai and the seafood noodle soup, and also the jungle curry..  all Thai hot.. YUMM.  on a different visit i tried the beef GUAY TEOW NAAM soup..Oh my, I really liked the broth, very nicely layered with flavor. I would have to say this is a great noodle soup, with a  thai twist..

Wanted to give 5 stars, but the buffet on a Saturday night featured no crab legs, just jumbo shrimp and oysters for a seafood buffet?  Service was great, I have to admit. The prime rib was tender and tasteful, leg of lamb was also yummy. The buffet overall was a great buffet, I think I need to try out the sunday brunch to get the full experience.

Tried this place today,  really good food. Reminds me of my family dinners out growing up. Best Chinese I've had in az in long time. . Will be back,  owners were telling me to try the duck. . Next time!  Oh, and dont go for the buffet, and do order from the "other", menu!

3.75 stars, This place is good.  The food was above average, but just a tad bit below the bar for Pacific or Hong Kong Gourmet. Crab legs were plentiful, and the place was very clean..  great value!! Will be back to this one!

Gotta say that the portions are huge! Had the steak and pork fajitas, pork was better, steak was pretty dry.  The wife had tacos al carbon, she loves it. We couldve shared one and had leftovers! Great place and ambiance, great service. The habanero hot salsa was very good.  We will be adding Nandos to our rotation. :-)

i loved this place, being a native arizonan, piggly's at the fair was the best, i love being able to have it year round now.  they are new to the restaurant ownership experience, so i will have to say please be patient as everyone will learn what works and what they will change.  Turkey legs and wings were incredible.  :)  cant wait to go back again.. for some giant fried frog legs ..!!

This place was a pretty cool place to go!  I love the cajun theme restaurants.  love crawfish in the oven bags with "the whole shebang", or trifecta as it is know at the angry crab.  Wasn't too to impressed with the crawfish here, we ordered a pound of the trifecta with 2 spice.  some of the crawfish were not fresh to say the least.  we ordered a lb of the Blue crab, shrimp, crawfish, and mussels,  all the same flavor and heat. i liked the shrimp, and mussels.  :)  we also tried a shrimp po boy and some fried clams.. lacking in the shrimp on the po boy, clams were ok.  I will be back!  the beers and good time was well worth it!  3.5 stars for the food, half star added for the cool factor!

Came here last night and had a great time!  Food was definitely very good.  tried a spicy tuna roll, Korean omelette, soon tofu combos for my wife and I, one with Kalbi and the other with bibimbap .   loved the flavor on everything and a great value for a Korean restaurant here in the valley!  so glad to see an option  outside of the few that are out there.  :)  Will be back!

I liked the burgers here, anyone complaining about the price should go look at what they pay for a value meal at a fast food spot... lol. Best burger I've had? No, but definitely a good one.  Can't wait to try the Coney dogs! :-)

Stopped in today, tried the house special beef combo noodle soup for lunch. I really liked it, compared to china magic, I think this place wins. Bringing the fam back offer the weekend to try the rest. Oh by the way minimum credit card charge is $10.
