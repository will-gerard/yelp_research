I really want to like this place and have been here 6 or do times but food is very inconsistent and certain thing are expensive. Wish there were more options in the desert ridge area-

Had a bday party there last night. Ordered the ribeye and shared sides- cream corn, broccoli and tater tots also some oysters. Steak an oysters were fantastic- sides were just ok and small portion. Cocktails were incredible. They also have live music 7 nights a week- could end up being one of my new favorite places to eat/drink and listen to music. Service was great- had the private room for our party, very attentive staff and then took the party upstairs and enjoyed the night while seated at the piano and great Arizona weather with open roof.
