There I was, alone and hungry. On my long drive before work I felt my stomach drop, it needed food immediately. I had no where to turn. Out of no where I saw a glowing sign that reveled the words "open" I walked into Morning star cafe I didn't know what to think at first but then I was greeted with a smile and an offer for a hot cup of joe. I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with wheat toast and sausage.  Not to mention for a very reasonable price. Looking around I could see that this place felt like home. There were customers laughing and having a great time as if they never left. I took my first bite of food and was amazed. Everything was perfect. The cook was extremely nice as well as the cashier. When I'm on another adventure I will surely come back and fulfill my destiny to feed my stomach at morning star cafe.

Amazing if you're looking for a quick snack. The hot dogs are made fresh and the employees are really polite. I would recommend getting the works hot dog with the green sauce and for 3 dollars each dog? Delicious. The only down side is the location which is on the side of the road and you're outside with foldable chairs and tables. Other than that I have no complaints. I am for sure a returning customer :)

I accomplish 3 things when I go to Yc's Mongolian grill. 1. I feed myself for the rest of the year. 2. Save money  3. Get a great tricep workout.  Ycs Mongolian grill is a great go to place if you're looking for a casual dinner/lunch. Every date I bring here turns out to be amazing. You get amazing customer service. All the employees are well trained and polite to the customers. The prices are very reasonable for the unbelievable amount of food you get. This is a great place to explore your imagination with all the combinations of food and sauces you can create. I feel like Da Vinci while creating my meal and you can too.

I tried to use a 3 day free pass to mountainside fitness and all I got was pushy membership employees trying to reel me in. I almost didn't even get to use my 3 day pass because I barely got passed the chaos of the salesmen. They tried intimidating me but that didn't work. It wasn't a bad gym just horrible management. Didn't feel comfortable one bit.

The coffee here is phenomenal, I can't start my day off without their Iced caramel coffee with cream and liquid sugar. (which I recommend) But the coffee isn't the only good thing here. The customer service is great the man in the drive thru makes my day with his excitement and humor it makes you feel welcome. I will always be a fan of Dunkin Donuts.

Where do I start? My love for Chipotle has been stronger than titanium is. Ever since I first took my bite into that juicy delicious burrito my life has been filled with happiness. I recently went to chipotle and ordered a burrito bowl with the heavenly chicken, black as night beans, brown rice that comes from the fields of dreams, along with amazing mild salsa, a touch of white cloud sour cream and the sweetest corn salsa, topped with the finely chopped green lettuce. I was in aw when I had this burrito bowl. Chipotle is not only cheap, but extremely filling. The portions could fill a hill giant. Thank you for always being there for me Chipotle. :)

AJ and his team just finished at my place in Gilbert and I'm very impressed and happy with the quality of work I got, for what I paid. He came out from Phoenix just to quote my house and even asked if I wanted to get it done that day. I have windows in the tough places to reach on my house but it wasn't a problem for Streak patrol, they worked around everything. The sills in my windows were disgusting but Aj offered to clean them for me and they are looking brand new! Streak patrol was definitely the right company to clean my windows! I will definitely give them a call when everything gets dirty again! Happy customer :)
