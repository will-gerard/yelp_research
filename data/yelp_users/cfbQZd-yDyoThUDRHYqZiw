The lady that helped me was excellent.  We had a bit of a confusing situation with 2 different titles that have changed hands a couple times and she handled it all well.  "Convenience" fees seemed a little high but I guess this is Scottsdale and not Avondale.    When our agent was off handling our paperwork, at least 2 other agents came by to see if we needed help.  This was certainly appreciated as we were in a hurry. Heck, everyone is in the hurry when it comes to DMV stuff.    I would use them again.

This review is based on several visits here in the last couple months and in particular yesterday. The counter girl was just plain rude and bitchy. Her coworker even noticed and tried to lighten the mood with no luck. A word of advice, if you don't like people, go find a job where you're not customer facing.  The food was good, once they got our order right. This was the 3rd time in 4 trips here our order was wrong. All I asked for was no cilantro, not too complicated.  Also, the men's restroom was overflowing all the way past the salsa bar. This place needs help.

Some of the best pizza around.  Try the AZ Cheesesteak sandwich also....fantastic!  Been going there for like 6 years.  I drive past about a dozen pizza places on my way over there.  It is worth the extra couple miles. :)

The blonde lady that works interrupted me to tell me HER thoughts every time I was considering a piece.  A friend and I were having private conversation and she thought it necessary to interject as much as possible.  What made it worse was after I made one comment she apparently didn't agree and was condescending to me.  We left without making a purchase and I will not be back.

Been coming here for close to 30 years and never disappointed!  If you're looking for lots of yellow cheese on your Mexican food, this is not your place; think authentic.  While many of the great places like Monti's are now gone, this place still delivers. if you haven't been here give it a try. Everyone is friendly and the food is fantastic.  and now.....back to my Margarita!

I've been here several times at it is always the same experience,  SUPER SLOW and less than good service. I try to eat by the Paleo plan, therefore I get no rice or beans here.  When you don't  order rice or beans (the huge filler ingredients) they look at you crazy here. I asked for a bunch of veggies and my steak. I received a pinch of veggies and  barely 1 scoop of meat. When I asked the lady for a little more of each I was told I'd have to pay extra. Stingy. I wasn't asking for extra, just a fair amount.  Not going back to this location.

They have been in our rotation of regular pizza stops for us for a couple years. I was disappointed in the past at the size of the wings, but the flavor was always pretty good. Just ordered last night for the first time in a couple months and was MORE than excited to see the new meaty wings. You guys just moved back up a couple notches in my book! Keep up the good work!  Service by both people at the counter was friendly and helpful. The check in coupon was gladly accepted. $5 off. Heck yea!

Everyone is always nice and polite every time I come to this location. They are a little slow some times, possibly understaffed but no complaints.  On the occasional lazy morning where I don't feel like cooking or shopping, they make a great breakfast flatbread sandwich; if you haven't tried it, ya should!

Been here 20+times in the last year. Typically slow but today was the worst. 3 cars in front of me and it took 22 minutes to get my food. I was offers a 10% discount. Which would have been nice,  but when I got home my order was incorrect.  I was given the excuse that they ran out of cooked food. If that's the case, where was the management?  Where was the coordination making sure the cooks were on top of things? Not cool for lunch time.

Annoyed that the very day their new add comes out, I go to the store for 2 items and they have neither.  Nice planning, Officemax.

If I could give 0 stars I would. The guys were nice enough when you drop your car off. You expect that they are always going to try to sell you a package or at least up sell your selection for wash.   The wash however was the worst I've ever had. Over $20 and the inside wasn't wiped down well at all. The wheels were still all dirty. The insides of the windows had streaks. The outside was just ok.   I was in a hurry and didn't take a very close look until I got home. So completely disappointed in the quality and effort by them.  I had to come home and spend another 30 minutes of my day fixing what they can't do well.

** PG rated review **  I enjoy the store when I have been there in the past.  I at least want to start with that....  However....  I had to make a trip to the restroom.  It was fairly clean and I do not have issue with that.  I finished up my business and was washing my hands.  As I was finishing up, an employee of the store (a guy in glasses) came in and hustled up to the urinal.  He handled his business quickly and ran straight back out the door......WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.    Thank you Mr. Disgusting Man for holding your parts and then touching the door handle I now have to grab to leave the restroom.  So I walk out of the bathroom (using a paper towel to open the door) and see this guy shake hands with someone and standing around joking with coworkers.  You mean to tell me you could not invest a minute to wash your hands properly before you went out to resume your non-work conversation??? Gross.  Get it together TJMaxx.  Make sure your people are washing their hands or at the least start posting signs letting us know that your people do not wash their hands so I can avoid your store in the future.

Best bakery on the West side!!! They did our wedding cake and did a fantastic job! My wife brought in some photos of cakes for ideas and they exceeded our expectations with the results! Support local businesses and give them a shot.....you won't be disappointed!

They take good care of me and my car every visit. You don't normally think of mechanics and friendly people but these guys are...every time. Brought 2 cars in and they cut me an extra discount.   Could work on making the accommodations in the lobby more hospitable. It was pretty hot in here, stale air. Turn on the air guys!

Best car wash value in the valley! Always get a great wash. It's also well maintained. I've never had a problem with vacuum or air compressors not working. Shaded as well which is a huge deal in our hot city.

Wow! Went their on a whim and was pleasantly surprised to enjoy some of the best Thai food I've had in years. The atmosphere was relaxing, the staff polite and attentive. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

I have been a HUGE fan of Cafe Rio and went to the Gilbert location many many times when I lived in the East Valley.  I would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there I enjoyed it so much.    Once I heard they were opening a location on my new end of town I was thrilled to say the least.  It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.    Well......that is not exactly the way it turned out.   I've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.    Each time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact, they seemed stressed,  grumpy, and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.    I'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management/ownership, you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.    Once we navigated the line and survived the slow service, we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left, and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said, is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So, they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.    By this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case, an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap, but come on, stop being so chincy, CR.   I've just noticed the meat portions have become smaller, the prices have gone up, the service has gone south, and now we are no longer loyal customers.

You want coffee? This is the place to go. The drive through only has 1 lane and can get a bit congested but they move fairly quick. Everyone here is super friendly. I sometimes wonder how much caffeine they consume cuz they are freaky excited some times. :)

Had high hopes based of a friend's recommendation but instead it was a let down.  I give 2 stars as the beer was pretty good and the burger (when we finally got it) was tasty. We came in at about 8pm on 4/18. Dinner rush appeared to be mostly gone so it was about half full.  We ordered beer and and calamari appetizer which came out fairly quick. When we ordered dinner however, it took 35 minutes for it to come out. We witnessed our server sitting at the bar at one point, braiding another server's hair (yuck), and later when we asked her for a side of ranch, she went over to the server station and was counting her cash out for several minutes before she returned. It shouldn't take 35 minutes for a burger to come out. The food was good, hope you have better luck with service than we did.
