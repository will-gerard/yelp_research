Took my daughter and her friend out to CNC and they had a blast! The staff was great and the lines weren't long at all.

We were at Arrowhead CC for a swim meet and as much as I enjoy Arrowhead CC for golf this is not a great place to host swimming championships.

Servers mixed up orders, overly salted fries, peach tea tasted rancid.

5 minutes of walking around in this small store trying to find an employee to answer our question is ridiculous.

Considering this is like my second home with the frequency I am there, the customer service is always great however I am still getting use to the new layout!

Irrefutably in the 4x4 industry shit happens and unfortunately for me, I happened to roll my jeep. Not going to deny it was such a slow roll, it was exciting to the point of getting over the fear of what a rollover feels like and come out with no damage to my roll cage or really any damage for that matter. With that said, I did hydrolock with my rollover and I was fortunate enough to have Arizona 4x4 Off Road Recovery to head out in the middle of the night and get my rollie pollie jeep fully running and driven back to my house. Thanks for being there guys, great job.

Great food, service needs to be better! Please acknowledge your customers when they arrive and give them the courtesy of knowing you will be with them in a moment if you are busy.
