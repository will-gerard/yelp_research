If your restaurant closes at 10 pm then why can't I order fried rice TOGO at 9:30?!! That's absolutely ridiculous, I work in the industry and we would NEVER turn away business because "we are getting ready to close". Extremely rude job hostess!!

Just got my hair cut today by heather and I'm in love with my hair!!!  I went in on a referral of a friend after a really bad cut and heather was super understanding and took great care of me!  I was planning on growing my hair out but I love my new cut so much I think I might just keep it short!  I will definitely be back!
