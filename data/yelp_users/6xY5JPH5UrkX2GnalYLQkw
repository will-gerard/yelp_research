Service was slow although the staff was friendly, the food was horrible. Chicken tasted like it had been sitting since yesterday, they were out of a lot of stuff it seemed.

Went to big daddy for the first time to get new coils and juice. Great selection of Juice, Grapple and unprovoked are fantastic. Can't wait to buy more and see how they are, and the prices are awesome.
