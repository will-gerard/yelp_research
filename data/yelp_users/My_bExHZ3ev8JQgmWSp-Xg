My favorite boneless wings in the valley with the Bourbon Glaze of course.  They used to have awesome shoestring fries but now they are just the thick steak ones ... that makes me sad.  Oh well, now i just get the wings and a salad.  The turkey melt is awesome as well.  Fun to go for happy hour now and again... Not impressed with the burgers - as long as I stick to my favorites, they keep their four stars ... otherwise would probably drop to 3.

Everyone is super friendly here. It's that neighborhood bar I have been looking for. I have tried several things but the Byrd BLT is easily the best BLT I have ever had. Tons of perfectly cooked bacon, whole green chili strips,  avocado. Perfect ratio of everything. And the spicy AZ tots... Yum!!!  Drinks are also perfectly poured to order. Come here instead of the chains!

Well, sadly, I was disappointed. I had high hopes based on magazine articles and reviews and pictures. Based on pictures, did management change?  Mac n cheese is boxed. Brisket tastes like pot roast. Pulled pork just meh. Fries are awesome and southwest egg rolls are good. Everything was way over cooked!. Might come back for breakfast but likely won't even bother.

The new salon looks great. I have been going to see Trini for 10 years in three different places and he always does an awesome job even when I don't know what I want, which is most of the time. He is an expert of making my hair look great no matter what state it is in!
