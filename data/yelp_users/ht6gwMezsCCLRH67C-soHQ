The chicken salad from Houstons is not on the menu, but they'll make it for you... THE best!

Was told upon arrival to wait 20-25 minutes. Waited 45 minutes for someone to help, then left and returned the next day... To repeat the exact same process as the day before. If you're going to waste 3 hours of my weekend, at least be honest with me about my wait time.

This is officially the greatest coffee place I have ever visited in my life. The vegan, gluten-free snickerdoodles are to die for, and I highly recommend the frozen mocha if you enjoy sweet drinks. Plus, love the outdoor view!
