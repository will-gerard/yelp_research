Worth every penny! It's so nice to be able to swim without being out in the heat. I have a pool and still go here a couple times a week. Be careful with small kids though, the waves pack a punch.

Finally a date night  after 6 months, and wanted something special. My husband and I chose Brazilian Bull Steakhouse after seeing a billboard on the freeway, and after having our anniversary at Fogo de Chao, we were excited to have a Brazilian steakhouse on our side of town! Well, I wish we had spent the extra $ and went to Fogo de Chao,  because we were miserable here. We made early reservations so we could have plenty of time before our movie, and when we got to the restaurant at 4:30 there was only one other table occupied and they left shortly after we got our drinks. Now I will say this, THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, but that's all that was good. The salad/hot bar was pretty, but the cold salads were bland, the shrimp were thumbnail size, and the meatballs needed seasoning. I had one bite of potato salad and one bite of hummus, both tasted like  what you get at the deli of your grocery store. The cheese bread which the server raved about were quarter-size and had no real taste other than slightly freezer-burned. At this point, I wish we would've just left, but we were holding out that hopefully the meat would make up for ll this, because really, who goes to these places for the salad bar?? Well, it didn't get better. We tried all the meats offered except for the chicken hearts, and the only one I ate all of was the pineapple, and that was mainly to get the other taste out of my mouth. The rest was overcooked, dry, and either extremely salty or no taste whatsoever. Even when I asked for medium rare, everything was medium well or well done. I wish I had had the balls to leave, I expected so much, and now I'm out $100 that I could've spent at a much better restaurant. Extremely, extremely disappointed.

I AM NOW A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE! I came in tonight for a book-signing with Jenny Lawson and the store was packed! Normally when I am out shopping I have to use a mobility cart because I can't be on my feet for very long without being in extreme pain. I knew that the bookstore didn't have these carts and because of how much I like the author, I was prepared for a long wait in line and if I'm lucky, maybe a corner of the rug that I could park my butt for the reading. While I was in line I asked one of the employees running the area if there was a spot I could sit for a minute without losing my space in line and they took me to an actual seat for the whole reading! These three employees were so awesome and were really taking care of the customers. After the reading was finished and it was time to get books signed, the same employee came right to me and took me to meet the author, very first in line!!! I can't say again how wonderful the customer service was tonight and how grateful I am to be treated with so much care. I have been an occasional customer of Changing Hands for 20+ years and I will now actively choose them as my first pick bookstore in Phoenix. Thanks Changing Hands!!!

My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful "staycation" at The Clarendon for our anniversary last night, 1/6/13, and I can't say enough good things about our visit! The customer service at the front desk was top-notch, the room was modern, clean, and the bed was huge and so comfortable! We did not have the chance to use the pool or spa but enjoyed the roof top lounge and really appreciated the motion-activated heaters which kept it possible to enjoy the gorgeous night time views without freezing our tails off. We also loved all the free munchies from the front desk, and spent some time walking the halls admiring all the art. Many, many thanks to Ben Bethel and all the Clarendon staff for making our stay so enjoyable, I can't wait to return!  *I also just received a call from Greg at the front desk thanking me for my stay. Awesome follow-up and +++customer service!

I'm so torn over the rating! The food was fantastic! I had the Cottage Pie, my husband had the Carne Adovado. Both were rich, tasty, and well-made, but the service was dismal! It took 10 minutes for our waitress to approach the table, which wasn't initially a problem but the service only went downhill from there. It took a half-hour to get our food, and our server never checked on drinks, we sat there with empty glasses and drinks with no ice, finally went to the bartender for refills. Again, the food was awesome! With my husband being a pastry chef we always want to try desserts and ordered the Bonaffee Pie and the Apple Pasty, after we ordered we waited...and waited...and waited, no sign of our server, finally waved down another server he checked and our desserts were right there! Again, our server nowhere to be seen, still empty glasses. After waiting for so long we weren't really interested in our desserts anymore unfortunately, then surprise! Suddenly our server was there with the bill!! After not seeing her for 40 minutes she drops the bill, doesn't offer boxes, no conversation, just drops the check. After we paid, she hovered at the next table which was empty and took the check before we were even completely out of our seat.      So TL;DR         For our first time here, food was excellent, but service was so bad we won't be back! I'll give the Tempe location a try, hopefully service will be better, but I won't go back to the Mesa location again.

So happy to find this in my neighborhood! I went with my husband and my son and we ordered the Meat Lovers Platter and OMG food!!! It was SO much food, way more than the three of us could eat, but it was delicious! The gyro meat is fab and their pita tasted fresh. If you are not a big salt eater be warned, it is really salty, but luckily that's how I like It! We ended up with enough leftovers for 3 more meals!  Oh and did I mention baklava cheesecake?? Yummmmmm! Overall the restaurant was clean, the staff attentive and the food was great!
