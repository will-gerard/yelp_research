I love this church! Amazing worship with very talented leaders. Scripture is important here. I love how the Pastors always refer to the word of the Bible. I love their messages and their music. They also have many opportunities to connect with other people. Small groups and groups for every age, which is the way you will really get to know others in the church. Love their Wednesday nights! Whether your single, married, young or older, you always feel welcome here. Their motto, "Love God, Love People" is so true at this church. I'm so glad I found Highlands.

I'm in love! Great place for lunch or brunch. Really creative yummy drinks and service was amazing! And the food was soooo good! I had the curry with eggs. Gluten free wasn't on the menu but they made it for us anyway. Really good gluten-free French toast! Michelle, our server was very accommodating! Thanks for amazing meal. It was awesome.

I was so disappointed in this restaurant wanted it to be great because I live nearby but the service, ambience, and food was terrible! We ordered a bone-in ribeye and was delivered a boneless steak 3 different times! The first time it was raw and it just got worse after that. We ordered it medium rare to medium. We also had to have our potatoes returned because they were cold by the time we had our steak delivered the third time. The potatoes tasted like frozen diced hash browns that had been heated up with cheesy sauce poured them. The wine that the waitress recommended was also terrible. She definitely did not have any knowledge of the wines. The waitress must have worked at Denny's before working here. She could also not stop talking. Definitely not the formal service you would expect in this type of restaurant. With the prices they command, the food definitely does not live up to it. Also, the lighting was terrible! Not romantic at all. I felt like I was in the cafeteria. Super bright and light and it did not feel like a high-end restaurant. I won't be returning! Eddie V's or Mastro's is a much better choice.
