God forbid you walk in 30 minutes before they close! There was a snobby teen girl there who you could tell was easily glaring at us and complaining about us to other coworkers. Yeah, having customers suck, because then you'd have to work...boo hoo! That's what a job is! It means you WORK! We left about 5 minutes from closing, so I don't see why all this drama even happened! Managers, you need to hire some more PROFESSIONAL people, not young bimbos!

I had a friend purchase a car here and even though she told me I should never go there due to her bad experience, I regrettably did. The staff in the used car department obviously judge you by your appearance. I drove up in my sister's minivan (because my car was getting fixed) and not one salesperson came over to greet me. I walked the car lot for approximately ten minutes and still no salesperson around. Angered, I left and complained to my friend, who gave me that "I told you so" look.  A couple days passed, and I was curious if it really was the minivan that the salespeople judged... So I took my car and sure enough, I had the salespeople eating out of the palm of my hands! Of course I didn't buy anything, who would?  In conclusion, Bell Ford doesn't care if you're a hardworking employee or business owner like me. Because unless you look like you have money falling out of your pockets, they won't even know you're there...

Great service! I was very pleased with how the staff easily answered my questions. They were very knowledgeable with their products!

I visited this ace location about a couple days ago and since then have been debating about writing this review. I went in to buy some equipment for my husband's tiling business. Of course, when a male employee sees a woman buying equipment he automatically assumes we don't know what's going on. Wrong! Both my husband and I built his business and I know EVERYTHING about tiling and the equipment needed. So ACE hardware store, educate your employees to not wrongfully discriminate against women, thus treating them like they don't belong in a hardware store. That's unprofessional and just plain stupid.

The service took forever. They asked me to park out front, which I didn't mind. But after a few minutes of questioning if the teenagers in the back even remembered I was out there, I got pretty fed up. All I ordered was a few nuggets and fries... Then I get home and find hair in my food! Seriously!? When you're coming home from a long day, you don't want shitty service and shitty food! I get that it's not a five-star restaurant, but at least have the decency to get your customers out of there at a reasonable hour and give them food worth waiting for! Disgusting. Disgusting food and terrible service.

This place is perfection. Point made.   Everything from the service to the food...couldn't have been better.

I, along with a couple of friends visited this place last Friday night. Normally we go the 59th and Thunderbird location, but our server Kristin wasn't there so we left. (A tip to anyone going there, turn around and leave if Kristin is not working. We've had gone there a couple times and the service was horrendous.) Anyway, the service lacked in every way. We waited forever for our food and when it arrived, it was sadly not worth the wait. I know that part the server could not control, but she could've had a better attitude about it. When we asked another server for a refill, we couldn't have been more uncomfortable due to the whole attitude issue. I'm sorry Streets Of New York, but I can't seem to be willing to understand the wait time if the server is treating us like a nuisance. I guess it takes a special kind of server to keep the good paying customers around... What a shame.

This is by far one of my most personal reviews: A few days ago I wrote a review for another Streets of New York that I visited. The service was slacking and the food was bland. In that review, I mentioned a young woman by the name of Kristin. She has been MY waitress for the past few months (yes I'm that selfish). Anyway, I met Kristin when she came to my business and handed out some menus. She was very persuasive ;) so a few colleagues and I visited that evening. The food was fantastic, the restaurant was dimly lit but clean, and the service was phenomenal! We asked for a manager and was told he would be right out, but never showed. So since we didn't get a chance to tell management, here is a review for everyone to see. * I would not recommend this place for delivery. We ordered from the catering menu to be brought to our shop and the order was incorrect. The manager took our order so I would've thought she would've done a better job. Although, her English was rough so I'll hand that to her.  * Also, my girlfriends and I stopped in a couple other times when Kristin was not serving. The service was slacking and we had to ask twice for everything! If you want good service, you know who to ask for. ;) * Don't get your hopes up if the manager says he will come to your table to meet you. Seeing the manager is like seeing Bigfoot.  * Last but not least, check your dishes! Sometimes the dishes aren't as clean as you would like them to be...  I hope I was helpful! :)

This place was amazing. Delicious food at great prices and everything seemed to be fresh. The only reason I didn't give it give stars was because of the cleanliness of the restrooms. Other than that, I would highly recommend it!

A girlfriend and I first tried this little spot yesterday and OMG, it was amazing! We loved, loved, loved the service! The place was clean, the food was fast and the staff were very pleasant! There is a sweet older woman who refills your drinks, she doesn't speak English that well, but the way she makes sure you're taken care of makes you want to come back to the restaurant over and over. Whenever the staff is waiting on you, they are cleaning the restaurant. There was never a moment that I saw any of the employees just lounging around. That makes me as a customer more confident in the quality of the food. Speaking of the food, it was sooooo delicious! They start you off with the chips and salsa, which, I'm a huge wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but that was to die for! ;) Then we were offered the fried ice cream. I've never tried it before but my friend insisted. Like everything else, it's needless to say that it was scrumptious! I could keep raving about this place, but I got to get back to work. Lol!

This place is dirty and the staff is obnoxious. Glad next month is my last month in this hell hole! Don't go here unless you enjoy the company of snobby and annoying jerks. What the hell possessed me to move to Scottsdale anyway?
