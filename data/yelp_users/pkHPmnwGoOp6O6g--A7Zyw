Ted's.  A place that knows great dogs and won't look down at your for ordering them "your way".  Make no mistake, their "standard" fare is quite excellent, but if you want to mix things up they'll gladly help.

I've found a new favorite Greek eatery in the Northwest Valley.  Fresh ingredients prepared as you wait truly deliver.  The decidedly un-ranch dressing tzatziki (hooray!) has just the right zing.  The lemon juice squeezed over the taboule gave the perfect finish.  And the shawarma... delicious.  For sandwiches, go for the larger "wrap" over the "pita" and take the leftovers to go; the tandoori-ed wrap _is_ that much better.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach, so I venture just beyond that 1$ mark; but there are certainly plenty of options within that price range.  Be prepared for crowds.  There isn't much seating room inside or out; I missed some table opportunities on my last visit and had to "borrow" a table outside from the establishment next door.  Regardless, I'm already looking forward to trying some more of the menu the next time I'm in the area.

Thai Pan is yet another new favorite entirely due to Yelpers' recommendations.  A new staple on my lunch rotation, Thai Pan features a large variety of fresh dishes.  The comparisons to Pei Wei are evident, but Thai Pan excels in every category.  They offer all of the "typical" Thai fare.  Atypically, they don't ask for a spiciness level for each dish; instead each dish is designed by the chef and the spiciness (or lack thereof) is indicated on the menu.  In fact, they pride themselves on the consistency of their spice levels from meal to meal.  They will make modifications for you; if you can convince them you can handle it, they'll even make a dish Thai-hot for you.  The curries and Hoisin are my favorites, but the menu is full of delicious options.  I'm already looking forward to my next trip.

I've been a Four Peaks drinker for some time and stopped by their North Scottsdale location for kegs, but have never stayed to eat and have never been to the Tempe location.  We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon to enjoy some of their famed Pumpkin Porter and some tasty food.  We realized upon walking up that we had chosen a game-day.  This proved a challenge in securing a table(s) large enough for our group, but inevitably added to the ambiance and experience.  The beer was as good as ever and the food was quite a surprise (more than the mediocre bar fare we had expected).  The service was good, especially considering the large crowd that had amassed in preparation for the upcoming game.  In fact, a line was forming along the sidewalk just to find a place to sit.  The food was great, but the star continues to be the beer.  I think I'll have to go back and get a brewery tour.

Such a guilty pleasure.  I had heard about this strange little fusion eatery long before some friends finally dragged me there.  Now I make up for lost time by spreading the wealth... oh, and returning often.  A unique a-la-carte selection of Chinese, Korean, Mexican, Cuban treats served in almost as many styles.  A machaca rice bowl? Yes.  A sweet & spicy chicken burrito?  Yes.  A jerk chicken quesadilla?  My favorite.  Basically, worldwide Dim Sum on a foil plate.  The ordering process can be quite intimidating to the unintiated.  The staff is more than willing to help and even offers a tutorial with samples, but they're got their hands full during the lunch rush.  Take a repeater with you, or target a slower period for your first time.  Unfortunately Chino has had to raise prices a bit.  I've scaled back some of my orders, but I occassionally cross into that $$ mark.  Oh, yeah.  I'd go for the snickerdoodle any day of the week.

I've not much of a sweet tooth, so I hadn't considered venturing out in search of cupcakes.  No, this experience was brought to me.  I'd never heard of Sprinkles nor had I actually been to Sprinkles.  In fact, I didn't even know their price range.  A completely "blind" tasting experience.  I opened a pristinely ziploc-ed box of six different varieties.  Inside the cakes were kept separate with dividers to prevent smashing.  If nothing else, the folks at Sprinkles take pride in their little cakes.  A group of us pounced armed with the conveniently-supplied knives...  Guided by recommendations I headed directly for bites of the Red Velvet and Carrot.  The cakes were deliciously moist and topped with the perfect amount of frosting; not too much to smother the cake but still enough to add some excitement.  After giving my palate a rest I went back in for some Peanut Butter Chip.  All were delicious in their own little way but the sum of those was enough for me.  Should I ever be in need of cupcakes I know where to go.  But I will remember that these cakes are best shared.

It's strange the memories you retain from youth.  I remember countless Flagstaff road trips; to cool down in the summertime and to play in the snow in winter.  Inner tubes... and Dara Thai.  I was disconcerted when I saw the signage appear in Anthem.  A little restaurant in a strip mall squeezed between a smoothie shop and some investment banker.  It _couldn't_ be the same Dara Thai.  It didn't have the same highly decorated interior replete with rich colors and ornamentation.  After waiting for the opening I ventured in as was assured it _is_ the same, and the food confirmed it.  A seemingly never-ending menu of delectable options.  All of my favorites are done great justice and I've found quite a few new surprises.  I had wondered whether the food could stand up to my memories, and rest assured that it can.

Per tradition the birthday celebrator gets to pick the dinner location; the choice this year was Ling & Louie's.  Only two of us had dined there before and the recommendation and menu were certainly tantalizing.  After some miscommunications regarding the reservation (well, the two reservations that were somehow BOTH forgotten) we sat down, perused the menu and started calling out what tempted us most.  We ended up opting for a family-style feast so we could sample a bit of everything.  The service was absolutely excellent.  No question.  Our waiter worked with us crafting the best selection of dishes, making modifications to dishes and cobbling together some special requests.  As the appetizers were delivered I was slightly disappointed; somehow I'd gotten the expectation that each dish would be a fusion specialty in and of itself.  Instead, the selections were more a survey of different Asian cuisines (with a few curve-balls thrown in for good measure).  The Beijing Chicken Nachos were the absolute standout here, but none of the other options disappointed.  We struggled to find room on the table for our entrees.  The Orange Peel Chicken was exceptionally light and refreshing; a favorite of all.  The Evil Jungle Princess was another standout.  We passed on the seafood dishes due to food allergies, but I'll surely go back to try those at a later time.  We finished off our celebration with a shared Chocolate Volcano.  It was lighter than expected and perfectly blended the sweetness of the ice cream and fruits with the richness of the chocolate souffle.  All told, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and each of us plans to become a repeat customer.

I'll admit, I consider myself a beer snob.  I've had my favorite beer-buying locations throughout the Valley, but Total Wine has become my favorite all-around stop.  The beer selection is great, one of the best in the Valley.  The staff in that section are typically very knowledgeable and make great recommendations.  But the most amazing feature(s) are the prices; by far the best prices on the best selection in town.  The prices and selection also follow suit in the liquor department, but I don't wander there very often.  That said, the wine section frightens me.  I'm only beginning to appreciate wine and I've easily gotten lost among the many wine aisles.  I think I'll stick to smaller locations for my wine experiments.

Stopped by with a group after work for a week-ending celebratory happy hour.  We sat in the nearly-empty restaurant area rather than in the rather crowded bar or either crowded patio.  We were advised that the happy hour specials were only honored in the bar area; at least they were upfront.  As our group slowly filtered in we enjoyed drinks and appetizers, but mostly the company.  The starters were followed up by a variety of mains and sushi and finally a few desserts.  The food quality seemed to vary quite a bit from dish to dish.  Some were better than others, but nothing was spectacular.  The service matched; good but not spectacular.    Overall, the experience wasn't memorable; much like my last visit to a Kona Grill (Scottsdale Fashion Square) many, many years ago (which I honestly don't remember).  Appetized the eyes, but not the palate.

Good ol' Chipotle.  When you really want that oh-so-comforting food coma.  This particular location is quite convenient, but they still have some practicing before them.  The line is slow, the proportions aren't consistent, and they really need more practice rolling burritos.  But I will be back.  And then I will take a nap.

Credit where credit is due...  this Chipotle has really stepped up their game.  They're now consistently on-par with other locations.
