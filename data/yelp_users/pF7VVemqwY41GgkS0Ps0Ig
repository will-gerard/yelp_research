I was so disappointed that the TSA pre-check line wasn't open to any of the terminals! My sister-in-law was here the other day and she said the same thing! The folks who are in the terminal or not very friendly nor very helpful. Not very excited about coming back here.

The food was really great! I came here with my family in law and they were really excited to show me the great food to Arizona have to offer. I ordered the enchilada plate with chicken. The only thing that really threw me off was the bone that I found on my plate. Other than that the flavors are great complex and spicy. I will definitely come back
