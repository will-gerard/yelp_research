This video store ROCKS! First of all, the fact that there is a video store in my area is a miracle nowadays. Second of all, they have all the classics plus new releases. Thirdly, the pricing and all the deals are the greatest incentive to keep coming back!

What great customer service! My boyfriend and I get to the doors well after closing time, Alex (I believe was his name) opened the doors for us! Don't get that too often nowadays. We also got what we went in for. Great experience :)

Specifically dr sell and his team as well as the office has such an extreme lack of professionalism and work ethic. They don't even have the decency to take responsibility for their actions. I highly recommend to steer clear of this doctor and if you have a complaint don't even bother going to the office management they have no back bone and won't resolve your issue.

What's there not to love about this salon?! The talent, the service, the ambience, and best of all, organic!  I love my girl, Jenna! And the new front desk girl is quite pleasant :)

Love this place! The food is awesome! The service however, it depends on what crew is working. I have my favorites ;) I wish they were open later though!
