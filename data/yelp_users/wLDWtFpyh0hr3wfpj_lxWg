I can say nothing but good things about dr. Dedinksky and his staff. They are like no other dr that you normally go to. Their service is excellent. Easy to get appointments, get a hold of them and great central location. I would highly recommend them as your family dr.

Not a big fan of best buy. They are over priced and staff is not helpful. I am surprised that they are still in business. I would shop amazon, frays, etc before I went here. I've had friends have bad stories with them not sticking to their warranties.

Beautiful hotel but not my favorite place. Have never stayed here but I have come here numerous times for tea. Always good but not outstanding. I would check around to some of the other resorts and compare before picking the ritz

One of my favorite decor stores. The store has such a great atmosphere and love going around holidays to get decorating ideas. Staff is always very helpful. They have great classes that they offer and if you attend you get 10% off that day. They also offer free in home design consultations if you need ideas and help with your home.

Love this salon. Very clean and all of the stylist are very talented. If you are looking for someone new ask for Hannah, she is also the best at extensions. Great local business to support. Very convenient location no matter where you are located in the valley

The best and most intimate resort in Phoenix. Stayed here for my wedding night so of course this is a special place fore but believe me we had many places to choose from. The rooms are beautiful, grounds are intimate and well kept and the staff will go above and beyond to meet your needs. I have not gone to the spa personally yet, but purchased a massage for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it.

I love Postinos as much  as anyone else, always have amazing food and of course a great selection of wine. However this place has become such a headache. It is almost impossible to get a seat any more on Mon or Tues night because of their $20 bottle of wine and bruchetta board. The special starts at 8pm, we got there over 45 min early one night and the wait was an hour and a half. I wish they would either extend the hours, get extra table or do something so they can accommodate all of their clients. They will accept reservations if you have a party of 8 or more. So last Mon. we called ahead and made reservations for our large group, we arrived 20 min early to ensure that they would have enough time to get our table ready and they told us that they just gave our tables away to 2 smaller groups. Hello?!?! We were EARLY to our reservations. Very disappointed.

Unfortunately I was in an accident and needed to get my car repair, as everyone knows, not the easiest process to go through, and not to mention inconvenient. I was recommended to USA Collision, and they are a locally owned company as well, so I would rather give them my business. I am sure glad that I did. Dave and his staff was very professional and made my nightmare easy and got me back in my car in no time.

I have gone here many times and they always do a great job! I had a last minute alterations that I needed done for a party and they had such a quick turn around time and very resonance prices. They don't accept cards so just make sure you have cash when you go to pick your items up.

Needed a new nail place closer to my house so went here on a whim. I went on a wed afternoon so was pretty quiet and they were able to get me in right away. Pedicure was very nice, massage was long, they offered me a bottle of water, normal prices, clean place, and friendly staff. My only complaint was they didn't have me sit under the lamp to dry so after I got home I noticed one if my toes was smeared. Luckily I brought my own polish so I could touch it up. I will be going here again.

I don't know where to start but it has been a veryyyyy long 3 weeks since we took our dog here, first we decided to take him Here based solely that it had such good reviews, I really wished we hadn't taken him to a place that I personally didn't know of anyone that had actually gone there. Take make a long story short we asked them not to take much hair off cause its winter and we like him long, much to  our surprise my husband didn't even recognize our dog when he went to pick him up cause he was shaved down to the skin. He was shaved so low that by the time we got him home his skin was pink and very irritated all over. We have it a few days to settle down and instead it got much worse.. We ended up taking him to the emergency vet that sat. Where he had a scrotum infection from razor burn from the groomers. He had to be put on 2 weeks of antibiotics and a head cone. Obviously we went back to them to share our frustration that a simple grooming has now turned into an emergency vet trip. The owner didn't argue about what happened and covered our vet expense so I appreciate she stood behind that, however she wouldn't refund the amount of the grooming and we are now 3 weeks out and have had to take our dog back to he vet 2 more times at our own expense due to complications from all of this. I have spent many long nights trying to nurse my little guy back to health and deal with this whole situation. I can't believe what an ordeal this has turned into.

The library sure has changed over the years! Everything is so easy to find no matter what you are looking for. I out my books on hold and have them transferred from whatever library has it to my preferred location then I get an email when it's ready and they are on a specific set if shelves! Easy!  Only complain about this location is parking. The lot isn't set up very well and can get tight.

The best place for fabric! I recently needed quite a bit of fabric for a project I had.. After shipping at the normal chain stores I decided to stop here in a whim and I am so glad that I did. Their prices are half of other fabric stores and their customer service is outstanding. They have hell me so much with my project, will always go here when I'm in need of fabric.

Great place for pet supplies. This is the only place I will go to get hay now. They have the most consistent quality year around. They are also locally owned so I live to support that. Staff is very helpful. My inky complaint is they don't have a big selection of grooming supplies and what they do is a little pricier than some other tack stores

Consistent hay quality, have never had a bad bale from here. They also carry my horses supplement that I've never been able to find at any other place. If you pay with cash they give you a discount, so try to remember that if you are placing a big order

One if my favorite tack stores for all of my horse supplies. Love the local family owned atmosphere. I have been going here for over 16 years and always have the same great experience. They now have a yearly customer appreciation day which is not to be missed. They hand out generous samples, have live band, raffles and really good BBQ. If you don't have horses or livestock they also carry great dog food, ones that are better quality ingredients than you would get from petsmart.

I am normally not a fan of the whole warehouse stores, I prefer to keep my money local and support local businesses. Recently tho we undertook a huge project if remodeling our whole house. After not being impressed with the selection of items from the "other" store we decided to give lowes and try and boy am I glad that we did! They have a great selection in every department and much higher end choices that designer wld actually use. I will keep going back here

Best place to go for any baby and kid furniture or toys. The big competitors do not compare to this local business. I needed some toys for my nieces birthday but didn't want to just go buy her cheap plastic toys that she would play with once and be done with. Went here and got some gray educational toys that she loves! Will alwYs be going here!

Such an amazing store! I could walk around here for hours. I bought pieces from here when we moved, customer service isn't outstanding here but I love what I got so much I just looked past it. Just good tip to know all furniture has to be ordered and delivered to your home so you don't get your pieces the same day. And the other downside is that you have to pay $125 delivery fee which isn't bad as long as you are placing a large order, just make sure you wait and get everything at once instead of doing separate orders so you don't have to keep paying for the delivery fees

Next to tj, this is my second favorite place for groceries. They have a huge selection of vitamins and beauty care and the staff is very knowledgable in this area. The best deal here is their sandwiches at the deli, they use high quality boars head meat and it starts at just $4! And they do not skimp on the meat, love this place

I always find it hard to find decent breakfast places. I recently had a business meeting at Cracker Barrel and was happy with y experience. They have a large breakfast menu so there is something for everyone. Their little store also has some unique gifts, which are perfect for stocking stuffers.  Bring a big appetite for here!

I have heard about this place for years so I figured I would finally give it a try. I wasn't disappointed but wasn't impressed either. We tried it on a Saturday which we were expecting it to be crazy busy, which it was but the wait wasn't too bad about 20 min. Thankfully we got sat outside which I where I was hoping to sit. It's a good place to people watch and everyone is always cruising their newest ride up and down scottsdale trying to show it off. I had the buckwheat pancakes which were recommended by the waitress and my hubby had an omelet with every kind of meat imaginable in it. My pancakes were ok, a little dry, my husbands omelet was fantastic. I would probably give this place a go again but wld try something else

The staff here sometimes isn't the friendliest or the fastest but the good food and the cute patio keeps me coming back. I first tried this place after getting a groupon for it so now I always keep my eye out hoping they so it again. Their pizzas are amazing and they have some different toppings. They have great sangria and the best part if the dessert. They have a chocolate Nutella calzone that they bake in their wood fire and it is hands down one of my favorite desserts, it has car mailed bananas in it and just is heavenly!

One of my favorite stores in town. Love their new remodel as well, make the store so much more modern and fresh. This is a one stop shop, great for clothes, accessories, and shoes. Oh and also the cafe!! The food is amazing! Little pricey but I guess you get what you pay for. Can't go wrong with any of the salads and I always have to get a chocolate chip cookie and an ice tea. Great atmosphere and nice staff.

The worst customer service here ever. One employee said one thing and another said something g different, was a waste of my time and will not be going here again. If you need any sizing larger than a 12, which most athletes are just fyi they don't carry. Stick with nike at Scottsdale quarter

Great ma and pa shop. I have taken a lot of my high end items here and am always happy, if it's not exactly what I want they always re do it for free. Just remember to take cash as they do not accept debit or credit cards and does take about a week to get your clothes back so don't wait till the last minute

While you are in be sure to get your makeup done downstairs and head over to the cafe for a bit of lunch. The pop overs are heavenly!

I don't know why I have never been here before, I am a huge chocolate fan and have always just walked passed it because I feel like the Godiva chocolate you get from the grocery store in those little squares are so so but nothing to go out of my way for. Recently someone bought 2 chocolate covered strawberries for me here and Helloooo my life has changed!!! The strawberries were huge and so ripe and the chocolate was amazing and very thick. It was hands down the best I have ever had and I can't wait to go back and get another one

I don't go here for my groceries or anything because yes they are pricey, but I am here almost daily for my iced tea that I can't get enough of. Their bakery is hands down the best. They have a large selection of decaf and regular teas. I also love all their cookies and baked goods. They typically have a line but always move fast. Will continue to come here and only here for my daily iced tea cravings

We have been coming here for many years.. In fact I have referred many family and friends here... Not a good idea. My husband recently had a cavity a d went in to get it fixed.. We have insurance but still had to pay almost $200 out of pocket... He had to leave right after for a business trip overseas and started having a terrible tooth ache in the tooth that the had "fixed". As soon as he got back into town we went in to get it looked at and guess what..They fixed the WRONG tooth.. Yes you heard right they did the work on the wrong tooth. We confronted them about their mistake but they refused to refund us our money

My husband and I attended ccv Peoria location for years, but recently they opened the Scottsdale campy which is closer to home for us, but I do miss this campus. The building itself is very warm and inviting. If you have kids, their kids facility is like Disneyland, they will be begging you to go back. Sermons are always outstanding and very relatable. Their main focus is getting men to attend first and appealing to them so the whole family goes, I love this concept. I know this church has really turned my husband back into getting involved in church again which is priceless. Try a sermon and don't forget to bring a friend

Such a great local bar, I always come here when I am in town and recommend this place to anyone. Not only is it s great place to watch all the Chicago sports but the food is AMAZING. Hands down my favorite place to get pizza. Must try the deep dish, you will be hooked. Deff a step up from your local neighborhood bar. Wings, beer, pizzas, sandwiches they have it all. Stop by, you will thank me.

This place use to be my go to Favorite bargain store however things have changed. Word got out and the eBay sellers have taken over this place. They are crazy!!! Trying to compete with them is impossible as they clearly are "friends" with those that work in the store in order to get first dibs. Last time I was there one of the eBay sellers had brought the store employees lunch, I mean come on where are your morals? I'd rather pay full price at Nordstrom.

I have a love hate relationship with ikea. It truly is a hit or miss place. First the store is huge huge so prepare yourself to spend quite a few hrs in here looking around. If you know what you are looking for and have done some research you can find some pretty decent pieces here, I think they have some great pieces for kids rooms where you aren't worries about them lasting forever

Love, love all the ice tea here. Everything at the bakery is delicious, if I could I would eat here everyday and get sick of it. Their sandwiches and salad bar are a great option for a quick lunch. Their grocery section is a bit pricey so I never get groceries here. Parking at this location can be a little tight too.

Desert ridge is one of my favorite shopping centers. Before they came up north we really didn't have much up here. There are tons of good shops and restraints here. Few of my favorite places here are of course good ole target which is the great lands one meaning it has everything and i mean everything... I love the grocery selection here and all their home decor. I also love homegoods here and frequently stop by to see what new things they have gotten in lately.. One of my go to places for clothes and home decor. I a, also a big fan of cafe zupas, their tomato soup is amazing.  Too many places to list here but a few are kohls, office max, Mac theaters, jimmy johns, pet smart, Ross, Joann's, old navy, bath and body works, ultra, albertsons, sweet tomatoes, in n out burger, hallmark, cpk pizza, Barnes and noble and cold stone

Beautiful resort, everything here is spectacular and worth the price. Best time of the yr to visit here is at Christmas, they go all out. Even if you are a phx resident I wld highly recommend taking an evening and spending it here. Such a fun place to go on a date or with the kids, will make you feel like you are in a winter wonderland. They bring in a nice sized skating ring with lots of fire pits, and have a free train ride that goes thru out the property on a tour if their amazingly decorated grounds. Love this place.

We have eaten at WCG numerous times before and always had a pleasant experience and enjoyed the food. To celebrate our anniversary this year we decided to come back. I had fish and my husband had a steak, my fish was very tough and the steak was a poor cut, very thin and dry. I took the time to email management about our experience and would think that they would appreciate the feedback on how this visit was so poor but I never heard back from them. We unfortunately will not be returning anymore and will go elsewhere to make up for our anniversary dinner.

Returned for our anniversary dinner, we have been here multiple times and always Had good experiences. This time however, food was horrible and would expect much better quality from WCG. Fish was very tough, steak was a bad cut, very thin and dry. I tried to contact the management to give them feedback on our visit and never got a response from them. We will not be returning and will have to go somewhere else to make up for our anniversary dinner.

Jason's Di is pretty good, their sandwiches are average. I haven't found one that I crave and have to keep coming back for. I do love that they have a nice fresh fruit bowl that actually has good fruit in it and isn't filled with cheap musk melon fillers and the best part is the dip it includes is amazing. I would come back here frequently just for the dip. I'm sure it's not healthy and takes away any benefits if the fruit but oh well. I also love that they have a frozen yogurt machine that you can help yourself to

They also have 2 saved convenient parking spots in case you are doing pick up you can be in and out quickly

I dislike Walmart, shopping here always put me in a bad mood. Thankfully I usually don't have to shop here but unfortunately once in a while when my other favorite super store isn't around I'm forced to suck it up and go there. Well today was no exception. It was gross, dirty, disorganized and didn't carry any decent brands that are actually not full of chemicals, dyes and artificial preservatives. The lines were so long, as usual. The cashier was rude, and didn't know how to work the register. Their staff is untrained and unhappy, just like me to be there.

This is the best grocery store you will ever go to. It's like Disneyland for adults. I get excited when I have to get groceries and get to shop here. I drive out if my way to come here cause its so great. I do with they would open more locations like this. Very high end feeling inside with so many different options, buttttt still with the great frys pricing. I was afraid when they were re opening after the big re model that like everyone else, they would raise their prices to cover their expenses. No here, they gave the store a high end feeling without charging the high end prices. Thank you frys! And they also have a wine bar inside, so get a glass of when before you go shopping

If you are in need of a new dentist look no further. My whole family and most of my friends go here, we love it.. As much as you can a dentist. We started going here after our last dentist made a big mistake and filled the wrong tooth for a cavity of my husband and cause him a lot of pain. So glad we were recommended here, never had any problems here. Staff is friendly and professional. If you don't have dental insurance their cash payments are very affordable.

This is my favorite location. Store is always clean and the staff is friendly. I go here a few times a week to get ice tea. They seriously have the best tea in so many flavors! I just started only drinking decaf and they are one if the only places that have great decaf! In fact it's better than the regular. And of course all of their baked foods you can't beat either. I love everything from their bagels to chocolate croissants. Everything is always very fresh, never had a bad experience here

There are a few amazing teachers that I love here, unfortunately tho I have been turned off by a few things there. The rooms and equipment is not very clean and I go to the first class of the morning and numerous times no one shows up to unlock the front door and let us in till after class was suppose to start. If they improved on their customer service and hygiene I would go back

Oh how I love this place! Every time I am I'm vegas I have to eat here. The first few times we ate here the pasta was amazing and totally worth it, and they always give you a complimentary loaf of bread w sauce which melts in your mouth. Sadly tho the last few times we are here the pasta wasn't very good and the hubby doesn't want to keep coming back here, but at least we can keep coming back here for the most important part which is the dessert. Anytime you are in vegas you must get the deep fries Oreos that come w a vanilla milkshake, nothing compares to this dessert.. Nothing

Kind of bummed about this place.. Have always been a fan of here. The setting and scenery is absolutely stunning. Pool is great place to lay out, good food and drinks. Unfortunately we went here last time night and had such a bad experience, we went for the pre thanksgiving happy hour, I received an email about it and we have been planning on going for a few weeks now. The bartender was very rude to us, we finally got so frustrated we ended up leaving without ordering anything. I wish our experience wld have been different but I will prob give this place another shot because it's so pretty but will steer clear if the bar area

This place has the best views in the valley for a romantic evening. You can see the whole valley and perfect spot to watch the sunset. The food is great as well, it is pricey so we only come here on special occasions or when they are participating in restaurant week

I needed some scanning done and was very happy with the customer service. I didn't have to wait and they were very helpful. Prices are very reasonable as well. I normally prefer to support local businesses but was in a hurry this time and if I need this service again will break out of my box and go here.

Finally was able to go in and have the facial I was waiting for. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing.. You get a first time deal and that price is good.. Their normal pricing is the same price as the high end resorts so since they don't have the same amenities I don't think it wld be worth the normal pricing. After I got home from my facial I noticed I still had foundation on my face. I took a remover wipe and got foundation off AFTER my facial! I couldn't believe it. They shld have removed my makeup properly before my facial. Very disappointed. I emailed them to let them know why I didn't reschedule because they called me to.. So I thought they wld appreciate the feedback on why I wldnt be returning again. I never heard back from them. I won't be returning for any services unfortunately, I really had wanted to.

I love this place especially their famous wine and bruschetta board specials on mon and tues buttttt it is almost impossible to get a table any more. Sometimes the wait is 2 hours even if you get there early. I wish they would change the hours so everyone cld enjoy the special. Parking is the other issue, you have valet and cannot self park anywhere

Great local place that is a must to try if you are in town visiting. The atmosphere is relax and not like any other place. The menu has a good selection on it and everything is yummy. They also have a cute patio, does not seat very many people so consider yourself lucky if you get a seat out there.

This place is hit or miss. They aren't my style of everything, but usually can Find a few amazing, neutral pieces here. Their prices are much more affordable than some if the other stores they are by. I've never had any problems with anything that I have purchased from here and if I did I know that they would step in and make it right. Next time your in the mood to spruce up your house be sure to check this place out

My favorite place for a facial. I am very picky about who I have work on my face and the products that they use. I have tried just about every place in the valley for facials and will continue to only get them Done from now on at ohana.. Make sure you book with Paris, she is very knowledgable and will get your skin balances no matter what you are dealing with. And I love aveda products, they smell great and aren't loaded with a bunch of bad chemicals

My favorite go to store that is affordable. I always stock up on tendy pieces here. Yes the store can be a little overwhelming sometimes so make sure you have plenty of time to so a little digging. Some if the quality is good and some of their basics aren't that good of quality, but for the price doesn't really matter

This is such a great shopping center, tons of good store. And did I mention that it is beautifully decorated and even better at the holidays? Love just going here in a date on the weekends with the hubby, lots of good places to eat including true foods and then walking around listing to the live music they have on the weekends. Also has pottery barn and restoration hardware to give you plenty of ideas for home decorating.

I have been here a few times on saturday nights when we are out in old town. I have heard great reviews about their food but have never eaten here. Have stopped here and grabbed drinks a few times and I would say that they are good but average. The bar does have a nice atmosphere if you are looking to go out but a more chill environment.

This has been my go to nail place for years. I always have a great experience here. The staff takes their time with each service and they do extra long massages.. That right there makes it stand apart from most places! They keep everything very clean and I have never seen anything gross here and I am pretty picky. I also feel like my pedis last extra long when I go here  Just remember to bring cash for tips as they don't add it to cards

I unfortunately have not been able to go thru the museum yet, which I hear is amazing. I did attend one of the concerts of women who rock, very intimate and beautiful venue.

Natural Reflections has such great customer service. We recently purchased our first home and although we weren't looking for one, we were lucky it had a pool! First month went by and everything was fine and we thought taking care of a pool was no big deal...well than summer hit and it got hot hot hot out and our pool turned green.. Very green to say the least to where we couldn't see to the bottom. I know..gross. So we called to see if they cld send someone out to help us and give us a little how to in taking care of our pool cause we had already brought samples of our water into the local pool store and was getting no where with them... All they wanted us to do was buy this and that and wasn't even working. So Dane from natural reflections came out not once but twice to help us and took his time explaining how our pool worked and what we needed to do to maintain it. Finally our pool is sparkling clean and we are so happy to have it. Dane and the staff are excellent and would highly recommend having them help you before going to that pool store down the road.

Been here a few times to buy gifts for baby showers. The staff has always been helpful and the store is very well laid out so people with no baby experience can easily find the itms they are looking for. A great plus to this store is they constantly are emailing and mailing 20% off coupons and they accept any coupons from bed bath and beyond as long as they are not expired. Just be sure to check the bottom of the coupon for exclusions, they have quite a few high end items that are excluded. Very pleasant experience!

This is our go to place for summer staycations. My husband likes to play poker and I like to play slots once in a while and this fills both our needs. The buffet is pretty good, not quite the same standards as Vegas but good for az. The rooms are always clean and have a modern decor. The complaint that I don't like about the rooms is that they are not very well insulated, every time we stay here we have crazy noisy neighbors and you can hear every word they are saying, every time some opens and shuts the door.. Guess what you can hear it. Oh well we don't really have anything else like it in scottsdale so we will prob keep coming back here for cheap staycations

I heard About passport from true foods.. I love their green tea and their coffee and they told me they get it here for all the fc restaurants. I now get all of my coffee and tea from here, they have a huge selection of every kind you can imagine and the staff is always helpful in helping me choose something new. Support local and get coffee that is way fresher than you would get at the grocery store. Once you try this place you won't get your coffee anywhere else

I know most people come here to grab a drink before heading out for the night, I never have so can't comment on that, but I am a big fan of their taco Tuesdays. For $2 a taco they have a great selection that will appeal to anyone. And of course it includes bottomless chips and salsa, you will find me here most Tuesdays.

I've been hearing so much about this place so I gave up subway for a day and tried it. The subs were amazing, bread tasted fresh, service was fast, I was in and out in less than 5 min during busy lunch hour. Only complaint is the mayo, the slap it on pretty heavy so ask for it light

Great place to see a movie, deft not your typical theater. It is more than a regular theater, but I guess you get what you pay for. It is also in a great location so be sure to walk around the quarter when you get done. Great shops and lots of great places to eat

This place is a gem if you are willing to be a little creative and possibly come back a few times because you never know what you will find. While we were remodeling our house we were in need of a new bathroom vanity so I thought I would stop by here and see what they had. They have a lot of items from restaurants  which didn't appeal to me but they had a decent selection of vanities. It was hard to track someone down to help me and I will say the lady was not very friendly but she did let me switch counter tops so I got exactly what I wanted. The pieces are a little banged up so you have to put a little tlc in them but once I did and the price that I paid for it made it well worth it. Next time we do any remodeling I will be sure to stop by here again

This place is hit or miss. I love the food, the menu has a great selection, however I have had some bad experiences here. I took my mom here one afternoon and the service was horrible, we sat at our table and waited forever before we even got water and when we finally got our food it was cold. I have been here before and usually have good experiences so I'll let this one go and give them a try again

The only reason I ever went here was because I had followed my eyebrow lady here as she was renting the back room. However this place is a total nightmare!! The owner is very rude and unprofessional. My husband had called around Christmas time and asked if he purchased a gc if it cld be used towards my normal eyebrow wax, the lady at the front desk said of course, So he purchased it. When I went to redeem it it turns out they are separate from the front desk so my lady asked if they would just credit me and the owner said no they wld not accept their own gc!!! I explained that my husband had called to make sure it wld work and that her receptionist said it wld, all she had to say was that her girl have us the wrong information. She refused to do anything about their mistake! I was so irritated and the lack of customer service and how rude the owner is. I would think twice before ever going here.

Horrible service. Wldnt honor a postcard we received months before Halloween because we didn't keep it. No where on it did it say this was a coupon that wld need to be presented, it was a post card that's it. Will be taking our pizza orders somewhere else, they left us in a jam with guests over. Upper crust doesn't apparently need any more customers.

Top notch store for any kids or baby needs. Hands down is better than any of the larger franchises. Staff is great and their toys go beyond just "fun" and are educational. I wouldn't shop anywhere else for my niece.

I am fan of a any fox concept restaurants and was really happy when they opened one downtown. I normally go here for lunch a few times a month. I would highly recommend their turkey pastrami sand which which is on a pretzel roll and is amazing. I also get it served with a chopped salad to try to make my lunch a little healthier and love whatever dressing they use.

Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it is hit or miss depending on who you get. I have found 2 ladies here that I love, the whole experience is very relaxing and pampering. As long as I can get in with one of the girls that I know are good than its worth it cause the blow out lasts for a few days and ladies who doesn't feel better after a blow out?

I was referred to az build pro and I am so thankful I was! Working with contractors can be such a nightmare and I had a large remodel that i needed done. Brendan and his team are very professional and helped me thru every step of the process. The design I had in mind was a challenge and az build pro took it in stride. I am so happy with how it turned out. My kitchen is now my dream kitchen. It's beautiful. I will be using az build pro and their team for my next project. Thank you for everything!

This place has great steaks! We rented a private room for a birthday last year. Everything was good, but for the price I'm not sure we would go back again. They have very similar quality steak to some more affordable steakhouses. It was fun to try it once tho, but I think ill stick with mastros. If you do go here be sure to try the chocolate cake, the size is huge and really good!

I don't know where to begin with this review and the amazing experience that I had at Sage. I am very picky with where I get my facials done, which I have tried many many places, I was hesitant to try a new place on which a whim. When I spoke with Amber I wasn't even going to make an appointment but she was so accommodating and sweet, I immediately felt at easy.  Sage conveniently located no matter what part of town you are coming from, but I would drive as far needed to come here again. The space is decorated very cute and feels warm, also is very clean. No worries about cleanliness here.  Everything about my facial was amazing.. The bed is so comfortable, all products used are organic and I mean truly organic not just "natural" so no worries about mast chemicals here. I was so relaxed when I walked out. I also appreciated that there was no high pressure sales to purchase all of the products that were used, this always happens at most spas.  When I woke up the next morning my skin was glowing.. The facial was very gentle so I wasn't sure what to expect as far as results. I have never had such good results from a facial.   All my facials will now be done at Sage. Amber is simply the best!

I hate to leave a bad review but I have given this ace quite a few chances and have never been impressed. I really wanted to like this place but I just can't. The other dry bar place that is in the valley is just a step above this one. The massage scalpes are ao much better, the environment, drinks they provide and most importantly the blow out. I wld think twice before going here for a special event or maybe try going here first and finding someone you like when you re not getting ready for a special event

Love this place, I go at least twice a week. This place is so much better than the other ones in town. They have the most amazing tomato soup I have ever had, it is very different but so yummy. Their customer service is outstanding, I'm always in and out in a timely manner. Oh and the best part? You get a free chocolate covered strawberry with every meal!

I am a big fan of the qq olive mill so I was thrilled when the opened a store in Scottsdale. In love all of the oils from here, there are so many different flavors that you can use for anything. They also have a great assortment of beauty products... I love the Chapstick and the body oil in lavender. Perfect stop if you want to get some unique gifts and they have a great selection of wines

I have been here twice and had great experiences both times. My sister in laws took me here for my bday earlier this year and we had a great girls night here. Fun dishes and drinks in a cozy atmosphere and of course close to old town so plenty of bars nearby for after dinner. Second time came here just sat at the bar for drinks and they had a good selection and the bar tender was able to make some speciality drinks for us

This is the worst experience I have ever had with a business. I schduled cleaning for my new home a month in advance, on the day of the appointment I took the whole day off from work, they never showed up, nor will they return my calls. My husband and I the past week have tried 11 times to get a hold of someone, and emailed. They have yet to respond. I have never dealt with such an unprofessional company. If they are still in business I am sure it won't be for much longer. I would not feel comfortable having them in my home and around my family. The responses from the business owner in previous reviews are shocking.

Was so excited to finally try this place and it did not disappoint! I tried the kale juice which was delicious? Even if you are not a fan of the taste of green juices you would prob still like this. And I also had the kale cedar salad, was very impressed with it. Everything was healthy and fresh, this will be added to my favorite list, can't wait to go back and try some more of the different kinds of juices

This is the BEST chick fil a, yes they all have great customer service but I was blown away by the staff here. They went above and beyond to help me when I came in with my baby. The staff was friendly and got me everything I needed without asking, they apologized numerous times that it took my food a little longer than normal to come out and gave me a coupon o make up for it. After a little accident in the play area they promptly brought a band aid and a little stuffed animal to make the little one feel better, and enough for all the kids around so no one was left out. I feel like you don't even get his good of customer service sometimes at a high end restaurant.   Moms this is such a kids friendly location and they were even rated the cleanest for germs. So impressed by everything, can't wait to come back.

I have to agree with the other reviewer. Pb normally has excellent customer service but this store has none. I have gone there twice now to purchase a glider for my nursery, first time I couldn't get anyone to assist me even after I tracked someone down, the second time I returned to give it another shot the sales associate knew nothing about the products and couldn't tell me what style it was that they had on display, I asked if there was someone with who was familiar with the products to assist me and there wasn't. When you are spending a good amount on some furniture you want to make sure your questions are answered and you are ordering the right items, I guess I'll have to find somewhere else to purchase from.

Wow!! That food was incredible! With every sandwich not only do you get your choice of fries or fruit but you also get soup with it and it was great!  Atmosphere is good, they have a great patio that's large and perfect to sit outside when our weather isn't so hot. Service was very slow but food made it worth it. Deff going back!
