I would never in a million years have thought about putting Italian seasoning in guacamole. Nor would I have imagined cooking a cracker-thin pizza crust to use for dipping in said guacamole. But oh my Lord was that combination delicious! And the fact that we had more chunky guacamole than "chips" to dip with was quite the pleasant surprise. Where for $8 can you get an overflowing bowl of fresh, delicious guac other than here?  I also have to mention how adorable the place is. All the throwback decorations made the vibe really fun.  I cannot give this place full stars simply because of how uncomfortable the booths were. The seats really need to be replaced because everything is so warped that one person could be sitting a full six inches taller than another on the same bench. Same goes for the single person bathroom. I can't imagine coming here on a busy day with only one bathroom.

What the heck do zebras have to do with a Mexican restaurant? Yep, nothing. I abhor the decoration here, but more than that, the food was not good either. This was not my choice of restaurants, but fortunately I do not have to go back.   The only thing that was good were the warm chips.
