The food was ok. I got the Orange Chicken and it was plentiful. The service was terrible though. They were mean little Asians here. Told me I couldn't add shrimp, then charged me $2 to take more rice??  I felt like I was in s different country. They gave me a kids cup to start with. Will never be back.

I've been seeing Sara for over a year know. Just to give you an idea how amazing she is I left my previous stylist after 4 1/2 years. It was tough at first but so happy with her work. If you need a change , look her up! You'll be happy you did!!! I'm very pleased and the salon is excellent.

This group helped me move twice in the last two and a half years. Fast, honest, reliable and very smooth process. Give them a call, you'll be happy you did!!
