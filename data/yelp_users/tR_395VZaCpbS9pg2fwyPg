We were very impressed. I've never seen so many Dr's. taking care of one patient.  Although my husband had a lot going on, it still amazed us.  The care was excellent. The nursing staff was above reproach and took care of every need my husband had and even mine. They set it up so I could sleep right next to my husband in a somewhat cozy recliner with blankets & pillows.  It was clean and sanitary.  We've never had such attentiveness and compassion as my husband did at Good Sam.

Oh my! I think I've gotten as close to heaven with the cuisine from this little slice of Italy. I had the Zucca(Butternut) Ravioli! Basil had, my husband had their lasagne - he says it's the best he's ever had. Robert was out waiter, ask for him! He not only was attentive but entertaining, as well.  We had their special, $55 for a bottle of wine, it was excellent. Appetizer - I had the calamari, very light & the garlic aioli perfected it.  Also a green salad with vinegar oil & then the main dish as mentioned above.  Our dessert is Tiramasu & coffee. Such a deal. Definitely recommend this place!

Definitely not happy with AMC THEATER PRICES! Paying $10 fora Senior price on  Sat. afternoon after 4 pm is OUTRAGEOUS. We're using a gift card my husband rec'dc for his, Birthday, otherwise I wouldn't be coming here.

I went in here around 5 pm on a weekday, there was no one in the place, that should have been my first hint that it was not going to be a good experience.  I was right, I should have just turned around and leave the place.  There selection was very poor, I couldn't even find items that you would normally find a a salad bar.   Their selection of soups was very poor, maybe 4 total.  Rolls or bread was pitiful.  The help was very lackadaisical, there didn't seem any motivation to want to work.  I watch 3 others come in to get served, it would take anywhere from 5 to 10 min. before someone would come out of the back to help them.  Amazing the customers stayed to be able to eat.  i definitely wouldn't go to this particular one. I can't comment on others, but I'd rather go to Sweet Tomatoes anytime over this place.

DO NOT EAT HERE. Very poor service. Our waiter wasn't attentive at all. We had to ask 3 times for silverware after our meal was served. Someone else finally brought it.  The original Baby Back ribs were very dry & hardly any meat on them. We were friendly with our waiter when he would show up, he never came by to see if we needed anything or to say thank you.  We will not be returning there.

Home cooking at its best. Always have fast service & friendly wait staff. You feel like you're in a western town for sure. They could spruce the place up, but that probably adds to its ambiance. The food is good proportions & always tasty. It's like a greasy spoon type restaurant that my hubby likes.

Never will I eat here again. We had their special ribeye, Salad & fries. We couldn't eat our salads the lettuce was either extremely mildewed or it was frozen. I told them we couldn't eat the salad it was so bad. The waitress only said "Oh Really" then looked at it & says oh yes it is. That was all, no offer to reduce our bill. Then proceeded to tell us that they typically don't honor the coupon we had Even though it didn't have no expiration date.   The steaks were really thin. The water tasted horrible. I will not eat here again.

Great place to learn the TRUTH & fellowship. If you feel empty inside or you have a hole you're trying to fill with things, why not come to one of these services & meet God right where you are at. Give Him a chance He just might surprise you & fill that empty feeling you are  clinging to.

You know in the past I would have raved about Sweet Tomatoes but it is fast loosing my thumbs up! This is the 3rd time I've been to it and it has not had my favorite soup, Clam Chowder.  Also, their selection for their sides has diminished as well.  Today I even had to ask for butter, they asked what kind and then brought it out from the refrigerator and let me take one then put it back! What's with that? You have to ask for the butter now?   We also tried the pineapple upside down cake, eh so, so!  I just to love this place now it's moving way down on my list!    It's still a great value for what you get, just needs to improve their selection for the sides and PLEASE BRING BACK THE CLAM CHOWDER!

We have been there twice. We really work with the PA for our neurologist.  They take time to sit down and answer any of your questions and go the extra mile to make sure that you understand everything that there is needed to be.    With that being said, both times we had appt's. we waited over an hour and half, which isn't comforting when you have questions and you had an appt.  Other than that we'd give them 5 stars!

Not so impressed. Sticky tables, probably one of the worst comedy clubs I've been in for ambience, they had 4 pre-show comedians only 1 that was any good. I liked the headliner on TV but in person not so much.

This is a fun place to come to. Doesn't look like much outside & when you go in the door you wonder if you maybe the right choice. You ring the doorbell, then someone opens a small window and asked if we were here for lunch. Then they open the telephone booth for the door.   The house salad with the garlic dressing was delish! Had the Capone Carbonara with shrimp. Oh my this tantalized my taste buds for sure.   Definitely want to come back for dinner the next time we're in town. Frank Sinatra frequent this place & I can see why.

I can honestly say that T-Mobile is the worst Mobile company I have had the displeasure of having their service!  I could rarely get reception or service in my home. When we tried to get my husband's phone unlocked w/3 attempts by them it was never unlocked. When we traveled we would be w/o service for hours. We were in Yosemite for almost a week, w/o mobile service, while everyone else in Yosemite were talking on their mobile phones. What's with that.  To top it off last night I was on the phone for an hour with their Technical Care Dept. spoke with Rob who promised me time and time again that they were going to escalate to their IT Dept. to get my husbands phone unlocked due to the urgency that my husband needed his phone.  It's well over 24 hours and I have yet to get the Escalated and urgent help that was requested.  Rob said don't worry I'm going to escalate this and make sure that they get in contact with you right away!  I'M WAITING ROB!  ALSO JASMIN TOLD ME THE SAME THING ON SUNDAY WHEN I CALLED IN TO GET THE PHONE UNLOCKED.  WE'VE BEEN TRYING SINCE SAT. TO UNLOCK MY HUSBANDS PHONE.  NO SUCCESS, NO MORE T-MOBILE.  WE'VE GONE TO AT&T AND HAD TO BUY MY HUSBAND A NEW PHONE THAT WASN'T IN OUR BUDGET! THANK YOU T-MOBILE FOR THE WORST SERVICE YET!!!!

We came on needing to get in & out in 45 min. It's date night!  Sat at the bar, had great service from Joe behind the bar. He took our order & is dedicated to get us out on time for or movie. Suggested Walnut Crest 2012 Merlot the whole bottle for $10, it is a very smooth Merlot, we were quite surprised! We'll come back just to see Joe!

The only complaint I have is that the lines can be really long at times, but it's always been worth waiting for the food.    I'm loving all the food, morning, noon and night! Can't go wrong. The food is fresh and different. I definite place to add to your places to eat on a regular basis. It's great to take someone for the first time to let them experience AZ in a different way.    The food is so good, it is delivered in a casual atmosphere you have the choice of eating indoors in what used to be the living room of this farm or outdoors in a patio setting or under the trees on picnic tables. This place is good for young families.  Oh you have to visit the restroom, it's a bit entertaining!  LOL!  Check it out, and let the world find out what  you think!

I have always loved Ruby Tuesdays, I've been numerous times at various locations and have absolutely no complaints. I love their cheesy biscuits they give you.  I also love the Blackberry ice tea, it's so delish that I create a reason to go there just to have the tea!  Service has always been very good, friendly and efficient.  The food is always good!  No complaints on my part!

I've been to Brio a few times now.  The first time, I loved it, it was so wonderful and fulfilling.  I enjoyed every morsel I tasted.  The service was impeccable and the portions were well worth all that was spent on them.   I then took a couple of friends their for Mother's Day and a thank you, they were quite impressed as well.  The food was melting in our mouths, no complaints came from us. They were very accommodating!  I love it would recommend it for a casual afternoon on the patio, or even a romantic evening with that special someone!  A definite MUST if you're in the area!    The aroma's coming from the kitchen definitely get your mouth watering for the delectable menu!  Bon Appetite!

We came for a early dinner. We were served fast, prices good, especially Happy Hour prices. I needed a drink after the week we just had. Food is good fresh & priced right. Atmosphere is in accordance with Arizona style. They have a great sports bar, music just plain fun. Peanuts, peanuts & more peanuts!

This is a very popular dining establishment! Family owned takes you back to Old Chicago. Always a waiting time. Food is definitely just like the good ole Italian style.  Bread is good,  service it's good! So what's a matter with you get your b. .t in gear & come on by for some good eats! This started out as a great review, HOWEVER we were told a 1 hr wait turned into 1hour & 50 min. Not happy with that :(

I've been going here for over a year. They are very busy, so you have to be patient upon arrival. I have had an appt. before and then had to wait as long as a 1/2 hour longer, however, they were so apologetic and they gave me a substantial discount because of it.   I always get their Spa pedicure, if you love to be pampered then this is the place to go. There's not a lot of ambiance, but it's clean and they staff is very nice and friendly. They aim to please. Give it a try, what do you have to loose.

Don't put on the brakes! Get the brakes taken care of by Ron's Service and Tire Center.  I was recommended by my son and his wife. This place was clean and very professional.  They helped me right away. The check my brakes and called me back w/in 15 min. to let me know the status of my brakes.  They said I definitely needed new brake pads, which I already knew. They also said that my rotors were fine, the first place I went to said I may need to have those replaced.    I explained that I needed my car back my a certain time and they said they would do their best. They did better than that, it was ready an hour earlier then I requested.  I would recommend them to anyone. Their prices were better than 2 other places that I had gotten quotes from as well.  I will definitely use them again!

I choose Harkins over all the other theaters in AZ.  Like the seating and theaters, Concessionaires are always polite and do what is required of them.  The cleanliness is excellent.  Love going to the movies especially at Harkins. I love the buying a Large or Extra Large Popcorn and getting free refills.  The drink Loyalty cup is also a great idea.  One thing I would love for them to do is have a loyalty card as I have from Cinemark in California where you can earn free popcorn or free movies! Other than that Harkins all the way in AZ!

They didn't have their act together today. It took 15 min to make 2 Smoothies & 1 iced coffee drink. Their attitude wasn't very good either it seemed like they were all in a daze. Perhaps it's the summertime blues.  I'm not impressed with their Nova Lox either, too heavy on the onions & not enough capers. However we'll be back as this location is my grandkids favorite place to go for breakfast. It's becoming a tradition & this is the closest one to their house we can walk to.

I enjoyed my pedicure and backfill. My technician for my pedicure was Linn, she was very entertaining. She seemed to know everyone. Everyone in the Spa speaks very good English.  Linn made sure I got the best treatment and she did a great job.  I was impressed with my pedicure as they are concerned about the customers hygiene they all put liners inside the tub your feet soak in. I've never been to a spa that did that!   Cece was my nail tech and she did a great job as well. All in all I felt very good about this place. I will return.  The only thing I would change is to have the back fill done separately from while I was doing my pedicure. I like to sit back and relax during my pedicure.

Always a great place to come with the GK'S. Food is always great even when it's busy it doesn't really take long to get your food.  TV for the kids,  Sports for the adults.  The kids room is separate from the adult room. Great family restaurant & great for kids team parties.

This eveNing didn't start to well.  They did thru didn't have our reservations.  Not good. I received a confirmation that downloaded to my calendar.  Then  we st down another manager came over &days you must be  De Klark's, we both corrected him.  He said he just seated another couple down & greeted them with our name. He said that they must have mixed up our reservation. We told him they told us they said they didn't have a reservation for us.  He asked is if we wanted anything to drink we ordered a strawberry Basil Fusion Martini. The server came & brought us a Strawberry Coconut Martini,  she had us try it since she was told the wrong cocktail. Neither of us liked it so she ordered  we wanted.  The food was good,  we both had the Rack of lamb. Our server asked if we were celebrating a special occasion we told her it was our Anniversary,  she said you should have told us,  I explained when i made the reservations i did tell them.  She brought us a  champagne toast & com'd our dessert. The rest of the evening has been wonderful.  After  we went to the bar & listened to the pianist for a wonderful closure to our anniversary evening!

Always live coming here. We found the best time is late morning or early afternoon. Service is always friendly, food is always good, coffee is good too!  Alice seems to be our waitress most times we come here, ask for her, she's great.  Reminds us of the sitcom "Alice" which was about a waitress.

This is the first time the service wasn't quite up to par. Do not get seated next to the door by the kitchen. It seems that, that booth gets passed over, week before another couple sat in the same booth & had the same problem. Usually our service is fabulous.    Service and food is very good, of course we've been there only during the beginning opening months. The truth will come once they have been open for awhile and we'll see how the service is!

Reminded us of being in Maui. Food was good - ambiance Hawaiian. It wasn't packed when we went in, but upon leaving people were coming in by the droves, well maybe not droves, but close to it!   The videos of surfers made it even more like being there.

This is a little place hidden away in Queen Creek. It's a little piece of heaven, they have very aromatic coffee, food has its own special flair& the service is quaint. Outdoor seating, great place to sit outdoors read a book & watch people. Today it's raining & I'm having a romantic breakfast with my sweetie!   Oh did I mention this is also a wine bar by night. They have a special Valentine's dinner planned to. Check it out.
