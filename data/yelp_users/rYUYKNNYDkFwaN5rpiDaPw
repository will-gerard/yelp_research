They said hey you've got 30 days to call to get your carpet recleaned, but guess what??? Nope these people suck in scheduling, communication and cleaning the carpet. Mine is still dirty and stinky.  I do not recommend them!

Really good food,  great place for cheap drinks during happy hour.  Fun spot for pool and Kareoke. Gets a little crowded but that's because it's good.

Garbage! Not enough meat, forgot cheese and mayo. Then the owner lied about replacing the sandwiches. He wanted us to wait another hours for our sandwiches. Fuck that!

Greatest burgers, sandwiches, soda pop and zucchini fries but the French fries are disgusting. I'll never order there fries

I've never been treated so poorly in my life. Very unprofessional, no one answers the phone there. We drove 45 minutes to get my daughters photos done but to be turned away because of miss scheduling. I will never go back there and I don't recommend it to anyone. They were rude, they won't refund my money and they wouldn't accommodate us for driving super far and it's my daughters 5th birthday. I'm so mad right now I can't even see straight! What a bunch of aholes!
