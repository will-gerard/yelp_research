This was my first visit. I had heard good things, so maybe my expectations were set too high. My boyfriend and I decided to share a few items: small ceasar salad, 10 inch wing pizza, and an order of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. The ceasar was good, the dressing was not overly creamy or heavy, it actually had a hint of spice to it,  which I liked a lot. Next came the pasta dish. I was really looking forward to this dish, so I was disappointed when all of the angel hair was basically sitting in a puddle of water with globs of marinara dispersed throughout the bowl. I'm sure the actual marinara was good, but it was almost impossible to taste due to all the water in the bowl. The pizza was definitely the highlight of the meal. Thick, deep crust pizza with good chunks of buffalo chicken. Overall, their food is ok, I'd just stick with the pizza. I would, however, like to note that my overall dining experience was not that great and is really the reason I probably wouldn't come back. We were sat at the far booth in the bar area. There was a smaller cocktail table situated within 2 feet of my seat. Right after being sat,  a man who I presume to be the owner or off duty manager sat down at that table with his beer. Nothing wrong with that. Except that throughout our 45 min or so visit, the man and his employees were conversing about their Christmas parties, wedding plans, and work drama/gossip that I honestly didn't care to hear about as a patron, but couldn't help to hear because of their proximity to us. Kinda killed the vibe we were going for and made us want to leave as quickly as possible. I'm in the industry myself, and I totally understand grabbing a beer and unwinding after work,  but not at the expense of the customers' experience.

I've been to this place twice before for a gel manicure. Both were ok. It was the visit today that makes me vow to never come back. In my opinion, a place like a nail salon which use tools and instruments that could possibly cause an infection; should take sincere care of their place of business. First thing I noticed when taking a seat for a pedicure was the amount of dirt and dust on their seats and side tables. Should've ran right then. I looked across the way to the manicure stations and saw at least 2 tables full of debris from previous appointments. Onto the actual pedicure, the guy who did mine was so unprofessional, he kept coughing right all over my legs and feet the whole time, never covering his mouth or turning his head. Also, the overall quality of his service just sucked. He was obnoxiously rough with filing and cutting down nails, but then half - assed the massage, which is primarily the reason I get pedicures since I am always on my feet at work. Immediately after the polish, he wasn't paying attention to how he was putting my sandals on, and pretty much would've gotten polish all over my sandals had I not chosen to go with a Fast Dry Clear Coat. At least I was in and out within 20 min? Definitely not worth the time or money! Save yourself and go to another nail salon!

Obviously they have good brews. They actually also have some good cocktails and a decent wine list. Their food is pretty damn good too.   This is a great setting for a Saturday or Sunday lunch. They're also very kid friendly if you're looking for a good family spot.

Based strictly on drinks and atmosphere, I love this place!! If you're looking for something different, make it a point to stop here! I bartend in downtown Phoenix, and whenever customers ask me what other places to check out, Hanny's is always at the top of my list! They have a great mixology program, and the bartenders know their stuff. I haven't had a chance to try their food, but I hear that it's quite good. Don't forget to check out the basement, the elevator, and the upstairs!

I love this place!! I'm glad they opened a 2nd location in Scottsdale, but the original is way better! I love the atmosphere here-the patio space really makes it. The inside decor is unique too, and really makes you feel like you're elsewhere. The staff is always on top of service. I've never had a bad experience. The drinks are good-it's a polynesian place, so definitely a lot of Mai Tai action. I can usually only have one because they're so sweet, but luckily they have wine, beer and a full bar as well. And the food?! OH THE FOOD!! So friggin' delicious! My go-to is the Mango Chicken Ceasar, but I suggest you try something new for each visit. They're BBQ Rib Dish is delicious. And don't forget to get some sweet fried plantains! Just like mom used to make!

Great food! Only downside is that it is always busy! It can be challenging to get a table, but worth the wait if you have the time.

The food was good, although I'm not sure it's worth the usual 20-40 minute waits on a busy Saturday or Sunday morning. I had the "Thigh Master", I think? Grilled Chicken with Spinach, Tomato and Egg White. Although I had it with scrambled eggs. I like that they have a good selection of coffee drinks as opposed to just having plain old boring coffee with cream. Service was fine, no complaints and it was busy, so I don't expect above and beyond for brunches. I'll definitely be back, but probably when I don't mind waiting around for a little bit first.

I am so glad I found Danielle!!  I made the brave decision to get my hair cut right before my Birthday back in February. While the salon and stylist were both nice, I instantly regretted my much shorter hair do. Within days, I was searching online for hair extensions. My search initially led me to several salons, and even a couple people who freelanced. After looking at price differences, I contacted Danielle for a consultation. I visited her home studio and had a chance to watch her in action and see how she applied extensions with such ease - definitely a pro! I booked my first appointment with her right then and there and she even fit me in on the morning of my Birthday Celebration so that I could show off my new locks for my big day. I have been going back to her ever since! She's done both the micro ring and tape extensions on me, and both looked and felt great! She is also willing to fix any of her extensions for you (at no charge) should they fall out before your re-application date. She has pretty much perfected her craft though, so her work is pretty much guaranteed, and I have only had one extension come undone ever.  If you're looking for some beautiful extensions and the best work at reasonable rates, call Danielle!!

I was recommended this place by a coworker. I'm glad he told me about it, because being from Tempe, I don't get the chance to explore much of downtown Phoenix. We went for a late dinner on a Friday night. Luckily for us, it wasn't very busy, so we had no problem getting in right away. They have an open kitchen, so you can watch all sorts of neat dishes being made right in front of you. We chose to sit at the bar, and had a wonderful experience with the bartenders. We were given some recommendations for both drinks and food, and we were quite pleased with the choices we made (with the help of the bartender). They don't have a huge cocktail menu, but it will definitely satisfy your drinking desires. I had the Temperance Trap: gin, amaro, vanilla sugar and grapefruit bitter. I definitely recommend it; went perfectly with my kimchi fried rice. My boyfriend had the Enabler: 12yr Dickel with lemon juice, maple syrup & bitters. Tasty for all you whiskey lovers. We also had an order of the Massaman Curry, which is served with Udon noodles. The drinks were good, but I'd definitely say that their food is king here. Do yourself a favor and go with a big appetite!

I am definitely a fan, I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.   Their cocktails are on a whole new level, it's hard to stop yourself from ordering a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th round. Try the Solero, Lemongrass Collins, Bramble, Slap 'n Tickle - and the list goes on and on and on.   I've only had a chance to experience bites from the Late Night Menu, but the chicken with watermelon kimchi is so good. I've heard their Ramen burger is bomb.com. Also...Cupcakes infused with liquor!! What?!! Get them before they sell out-trust me, they will!  The ambiance is dark and sexy, great for a date night, but also a great spot for Twisted Tuesdays with friends.   More than anything though, their staff is probably one of the best factors of this place. The bar staff are all not only legit and know their stuff, but they add an element of fun to each experience and make each visit pleasant.
