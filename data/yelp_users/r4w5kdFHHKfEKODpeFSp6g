This is the second time I have gone it to get my beard trimmed. I did not have to wait a long time and I am happy with the way it looks. My only issue is that they speak Russian and you know they are talking shit about the customers. Lol

I have lived here for many years and absolutely love it. Gated community with overnight security. Lots of trees in a quiet neighborhood. Repairs are handled quickly!

Being from the east coast it is nice to have something that reminds me of home!  Great food and a little attitude! lol  Bagels are really good and one of the only places I know of in Phoenix to get a good knish!  The deli sandwiches are stacked with high quality meat!

Slow as hell and no customer service. Ordered and told a long wait for spicy chicken so I said give me the regular chicken. Pay and then told an extended wait for the fries. For a small fast food place they suck balls!

The food was less than spectacular....i had the carne asade burro.  The meat was extremely cold, chewy and lacked seasoning.  I would not come here again for the food.  However, the guy working the register was really sexy, friendly and helpful.  I may go again just to buy a bottle of water so I can see him but otherwise I won't be ordering food. lol

This place is super delicious...food is always nice, hot and served quickly.  The Gyro Chimichanga is my absolute favorite. Plus the daytime latino waiter with the Gucci belt is super good to look at! lol Great wait staff and inexpensive!

My iced coffee was really good.  The place was pretty crowded and had a nice vibe about it.  Music wasn't my favorite but not bad.  The only negative comment I have is the furniture is really kind of gross.  It is almost like they got it from curbside on garbage day! lol  I would go back though.

Food was really good....service was really good.  Atmosphere was great.  Was a little noisy when trying to have a conversation but that is really the only negative thing I can say.  The Monday burger special $5.00 for burger and fries w/ the purchase of a drink was a great deal.  Burger was super moist!

Rude to make people pull forward on drive thru. Have the orders ready in the order they were received. RUDE!

Great coffee! Very quick service and low prices. The only thing I wish is they were open 24/7 like they are on the east coast.

Really great Thai food.  I am a creature of habit so I have only tried a few things on the menu.  The yellow curry with chicken is my favorite!  I get it almost every time I am there.  I am also a wimp so on a scale of 1 to 5 I get it on a max of 2.  Sometimes that is even too hot for me. lol  Service is always very fast and friendly.  Restaurant is super clean.  Free wifi too!

Food was fresh and hot. Customer service was pretty good. Drive thru line went very quickly. Loved my grilled chicken torta.

it was the worst customer service experience of my life in a hotel.  i have complained and called several times and it is falling on deaf ears. your company does not care about customers at all.  your lack of follow up is disgusting.  i hope that hotel goes out of business and all of those terrible people that work there get fired.  FRONT DESK DOES NOT CARE AND NEITHER DOES CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Room was dirty.  i actually prepaid for 3 nights and checked out after the first night and stayed somewhere else.  I read some of the more positive yelp reviews and found them to be incorrect.

I have no idea how long this place has been open but it is fantastic.  I went with the Phoenix Social Group from Facebook a few weeks ago.  It is a really fun and cool environment.  The outside area is spacious with lots of kitsch to to look at.  Outside and inside bar.  The drinks were a little pricey but the bartenders were very friendly and attentive.  I would love to go back soon.  A great place to bring a large group of friends.

This is the best sauce for chicken ever!  i wish they would sell it by the gallon!  Always polite staff, restaurant is always clean.  Did I mention that the sauce is the best ever?  Chicken is super tender!  Only thing that could make it better is if they delivered to my lazy A$$!  I heart you!

Teller was super efficient and pretty friendly.  That branch is usually good about getting the people in and out.  Very important when you are trying to live your life.  Cash dem checks baby!

Delivery time was quick. Unfortunately, I ordered the carne asada fries and the fries were almost raw. It was so disgusting. The chicken quesadilla was OK. The guacamole was lacking flavor. I will never order from them again.

Really clean place. Staff is usually friendly. Ordered online tonight so I wouldn't have to wait. Awesome experience! Walked in and the "artist" gave me my sandwich and left all in about 1 minute. Will def use online ordering again!

Great vibe, great food, great service!  I went for a Sunday brunch and had the tres leches french toast....so delightful!  The bacon that it came with was soooo salty and I like salt! lol  I also did the unlimited mimosas which were delicious were a little on the warm side.  Sat at the bar and the bartender was very sweet and she was attentive so you didn't have to wait long for refills!

omg...this was such a great lunch experience.  Casual, trendy, hip, inexpensive and absolutely delicious!  The western burger was super moist and flavorful and the side of mashed potatoes was sublime!  Fast lunch service and the waiter was super nice and seemed very knowledgeable about the large beer selection.  Sadly, I went on Xmas eve and I was working so the beer will have to wait until the next time.  Boozing on the clock doesn't go over well in corporate America!  We need to relaxe like the Europeans.  Booze, food and naps!  I will be going back here very soon.  My only complaint was they were playing cheesy Xmas music which was unexpected from the vibe of the brew pub!

Let me start off by saying the food was really pretty good.  I love gyro's and theirs were tasty.  The downside was the service was really slow.  The first time I went I thought maybe it was because they just opened and needed to get their service groove on.  the second time I went again it took about 30 minutes to get my take out order.  It was later in the day and no other customers were ahead of me.  I feel like that location is just cursed to not be successful.  It has been 3 or 4 different places in the last few years.  It is a shame that it takes so long to get your food from them because the location is close to my apartment and I love me some Greek food.  If the owner or employees reply and let me know they have improved their speed I would give them another chance.  Otherwise I will keep looking for good Greek food in Phoenix.

This place is fantastic!  The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a lot of white meat on it.  The key lime donut was truly delicious!  The only negatives about this place is that is isn't open on Sundays, they close early and they don't serve chicken until 10:30am.  If you can work around those obstacles then you will absolutely enjoy Welcome Chicken + Donuts.
