This is the rudest experience I have ever had with a store owner EVER. I parked outside his shop and he told me " I swear to God I will have your car towed if you leave it here" because I wasn't going into HIS shop. The spots outside are labeled "customer parking only" for a center full of shops. Not being specifically labelled to his shop. When my response was to him that I had never been treated so rudely by a store owner he mocked me like a five year old and added he likes being rude to people. I told him that I was going to write a review online about him and he said "good! It's spelled YELP!" Judging by the other reviews everyone has had this same experience. I will NEVER put my money in this mans pocket. Funny thing that he didn't know is I'm looking for new lamps for my house and would have stopped in after my coffee run to check out what he has, especially if he had been a bit nicer. Maybe he should consider the reason why there are a lack of cars outside of his business to begin with....

Love this place! My son asks to get his hair cut on his own he loves it so much. We had Kelly the first few times and she moved. She was amazing! Now we go to Jessica and she is the best! She really listens to what I ask and gives him a great hair cut that not only looks good when we walk out but grows out great and lays perfect! You know you have a good hair cut when it grows out nicely too. Highly recommend this place and Jessica!

This place is amazing and so are the owners. Pizza is AMAZING, and fresh. Last night was our second time in and the owners remembered exactly what our drinks were from the first time. They make you feel right at home from the minute you walk in. This place will be packed in no time. One of our new faves by far!
