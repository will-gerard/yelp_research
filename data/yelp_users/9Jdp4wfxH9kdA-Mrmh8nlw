I am only giving an extra star cause our waitress was very friendly and helpful but I was not happy with the food. The plates came out super hot like couldn't touch hot but the food was lukewarm. And I also didn't like that we ordered our food and a few minutes later it was brought to the table like it was sitting under a lamp or something. I will definitely not be back here again.

I was very impressed by this salon. I've always seen it just never stopped it but I am glad that I finally did today. I got a gel polish acrylic set and love love love them so much. It was a lot quicker than I had expected but I didn't feel rushed at all. Very friendly and a great selection of gel polishes.

I was so excited to try this place based on the reviews But when you walk in it smells of fish which isn't good The sushi wasn't that great they forgot one of the things we ordered and the service is TERRIBLE they said they were busy but there was 3 other tables of 2 people at each. Never coming back again that's for sure

Just tried them for the first time and I have been waiting for them to open. Terrible terrible terrible. I asked a veggie burrito with no gauc and it was covered in it and I dont like mushrooms and she said that there weren't many in the veggies and that was a fabrication. I tossed it in the trash without eating it And the tacos that we ordered tasted like they had been sitting there for awhile and they were soggy. I'm glad we tried it cause now I'm not wondering and I won't be going back
