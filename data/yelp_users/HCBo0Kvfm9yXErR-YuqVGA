My food hasn't come yet but this place already gets five stars cuz I know it's gonna be delish. My mouth watering as I type and enjoy the live and quiet guitar playing really incredible classical stuff in the corner. This place is uber cute and gets beaucoups des points for personality. Tons of eye candy in this little euro cafe lookalike, I feel like I'm back in San Francisco. I sat at the copper bar and was waited on by a hipster type.  Really nice and laid back service, but not record speeds.  They serve loose tea in little mesh bags that hang over your cup with a bamboo stick....more points.  My turkey brie and cranberry chutney sandwich was out of this world and the brie and pesto app I tasted was also pretty tasty.  It's coined as a meditteranean place but I'd probably call it fusion food.  Too many gourmet flavors to be strictly med.  The best thing about this place is everything.  Ambience....my favorite type...food is inventive and flavorful.  Nuff said....I'm still craving that sandwich and my only regret about this place is not asking that guitarist what he was playing.

Went to the Ritz last night for dinner.  I will tell you we didn't choose this one first but all the places we wanted to try were fully booked till 9pm (way to late for new parents).  So I open tabled it, and, despite reading poor reviews in the past, I booked it.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is not as nice as I thought it should be but the service was impeccable.  We opted for the restaurant week menu and it was spectacular.  I started with some marvelous mushroomy raviolis which were perfectly al dente and over some garlicy spinach.  Yum!  Then for the best part....the apricot leg of lamb.  I have never been a lamb fan but decided to branch out and am so glad I did.  It was so tender it fell off the bone and melted in your mouth.  I loved the apricot couscous as well.  The finale was the coconut pineapple creme brulee and, although it wasn't prepared on the spot, it made it to my top three of all time.  And it was giant!  My husband got the filet which was perfectly rare as he requested.  His starter was a caprese with italian cheese and was very good.  His dessert was not so great, a chocolate goat cake....some goat cheese thing which we could only take one bite of before calling it quits.  Overall, we had a really nice dinner and it wasn't too pricey, although I can see why all the reviews.  Of course, you shouldn't head to the Ritz if you don't want to drop some cash on dinner.  The normal menu is small, but I am from the school of thought to do less items on the menu and make them perfect.  The Ritz did that so I had to write this review to vendicate them.

Super friendly place with a great little atmosphere.  Cute and quaint and sometimes they have live music which isn't too overbearing but it is a small place.  The first time we ate here, we were back within a week with out of town guests and have since taken several couples there.  The menu is overwhelming, it's so huge.  There is something for everyone on there.  And out of the five times I've eaten there, not one disappointment.  The food is amazing.  Be warned it's in enormous quantities!  You will take some home and you will be happy to eat it a second time no doubt.  I cannot say enough about how friendly the service is and how much they care about your experience.  I never knew cuban food was so tasty either till I tried this place.  Get a pitcher of Sangria too.   I must do if you are in the area.

The staff is nice.  It's pretty clean.  They use little plastic disposables in the soaking tubs which is nice.  I'm a foot doc so I'm always watching how they do stuff.  It's super busy on the weekends but you can still be in and out in an hour.  It's a vietnemese place but English is well-spoken.  I'll go again.

Love this place b/c it reminds me of the amazing Vietnamese I could get in L.A.  I've been searching for it since I left and I have finally found the noodles, bbq beef, eggroll, cilantro and fish sauce combo I fell in love with the first time I had Vietnamese.  I can't say I've tried anything else on the menu b/c it's so dang good, I can't stray.  Since I was there two years ago, they've thrown a little money into the decor and it's turning out to be a pretty cute joint.  They also started doing fancy green teas, hot and cold and have made some menu additions that look tempting.  It's right next to the movie theatre and I go there any time I'm on that side of town.  I wish I lived closer.

If we're talking food....well....I've loved everything I've ever gotten here.  The brie and turkey sandwich with cranberry relish on pumpernickel is just simply amazing.  I also had the tuna salad sandwhich which was unique and extremely fulfilling.  That being said, my two star rating is more due to the environment.  Yes, it's a chic, modern and trendy setting...that environment is nice....but it's the waitstaff, valet and hostesses that ruin this place.  The service is below par, way below par.  And being a former waitress...I'm pretty forgiving.   Both times I went for lunch AFTER the rush and both times I had to request my silverware (different servers by the way).  Yesterday, we stood at the door for five minutes while waitstaff walked by us and noticed us but didn't do anything to seat us...then finally one felt guilty enough.  We sat down and were greeted fairly quickly and made our order.  Our drinks were then brought by another server and so was the food, he's the one that brought the silver too.  Then my iced tea sat empty for five minutes through the meal....totally unacceptable for me.  The first waiter came and took the sugar rack off of our table to fill it, clearly trying to get out of there.  He then noticed my tea glass.  The second server presented the bill and seemed to be the main one.  Who do I tip here?  Well they both deserved less than I tipped b/c I just can't do 10%, but it was close.  Anyway...despite the amazing food....the cold shoulder you get at this place is enough to deter me.  But I will be craving that brie sandwich and I'm sure I will go back.

Oh boy....I thought I loved waffles.  Now, I will likely hate them.  Thanks Lo Los for making the most superb waffle I have ever had and ruining my baseline.   I'll not ever be able to cardboard box it again.  I'll not know what to order when I get suckered into going to Ihop.  And the only way I can now eat a true waffle is to go here or fly to Belgium and try to find that damned cafe which broke my baseline years ago.  The chicken you ask?  Maybe it was a bad day...or maybe I just really wanted another waffle. And forget the syrup...you'll ruin the perfection.

Yeah the lunch was good...but woah...those freakin cookies were out of this world (after I scratched off the layer of icing on the sugar cookie).  I had a tasty french dip, my hubby had another sandwich (can't remember) and my daughter had a cheesy grilled cheese.  She liked the pickle the best though.  I will say the next best thing to those cookies was the tomato bisque soup.  I will definitely stop in again for that!  Cute little (no actually big) ambience and outside seating for those great sunny days.  It was also good for kids as you know all Mormon places would be but ours was the only little one in the shop.

Gosh, I really wanted to love this place.  I love the name and LOVE the location.  It had a nice little patio and nice ambience.  First thing I noticed when I sat down was how my arm stuck to some substance smeared on the table.  Bleggghhh!  Service was slow but nice.  My hubby had a hamburger, he wasn't impressed.  It looked greasy.  I had a tuna something or other.  I don't know, when you order tuna....you don't expect Starkist...and that's what it was.  Double Bleggghhhh!  I'm bummed.  Also saw the cook outside in front smoking on his break.  Strike three.

Cute little place, so I gave it two shots.  The first time I was there for a pedicure and they barely squeezed me in.  Got a technician that took forever and did the "old" style french manicure where they pull a stringy applicator across your nail and do a super thin line.  Despite the slowness, she still managed to make me bleed, which happens, but I've never needed a styptic stick.  Needless to say, I had a polish change somewhere else the next day.  Gave it one more shot last week and at 5 pm on a Tuesday night they said they couldn't do anymore pedicures for the evening.  They close at seven.  Too bad, it's pretty cute and it's across the street from my house.  But overpriced and inexperienced nail techs.

Found this little gem off the side of Indian School and gave it a try for lunch.  It's a cute little pastry and sandwich shop and the people who work there are super duper friendly.  My husband had a quiche...maybe one of the best i've tasted.  I think the best part of that quiche might have even been the crust...wow!  I had the duck and walnut sandwich and it was super tasty and very fresh.  Both sandwiches came with a dry spring salad with the most amazing carafe of balsamic vinegarette.  I rarely eat ALL of my salad but I scraped up every last piece.  My baby girl had kid's menu ($5) crepe and it was huge and served with tons of fruit.  She ate every last bite.  We also indulged in a few pastries which are quite pleasing to the eye....but keeping in mind that sweets aren't my thing...i thought they were just too sweet.  My french husband and half-french daughter thought they were perfect.  They also have a blackboard wall guests can chalk on while they wait.  Really cute.  Can't wait to try the goat cheese and raisin sandwich and the one with Brie.  Lastly, they make those "logs" around Christmas that the frenchies so adore and I'm guessing we'll be seeing one of those in a few weeks.  They also do the Roi or "king" cakes where each person gets a piece hoping they got the little toy placed in the cake (i did hear they won't put the toy in unless you insist).

Sushi is sushi. It's either quality or it's not. This place has high quality sushi. So when I review it, I compare it to other sushi bars in the area (ie across the parking lot). Music good, ambience good minus basketball on the two big screens. This place is always freezing.  Winter, summer, it doesn't matter...it's like someone there must be menopausal or something. This is one reason I pick the "other" place. The service is okay. I really hate when u order hot tea and they don't offer water to wash down your spicy tuna. Their sashimi cuts are more generous than the competition and their rolls are full. The bento at lunch is a great value and I love the variety of their tempura.  All that being said...I still hesitate and often turn around at the door knowing I'm going to freeze my ass off while I eat.  Here I am now, guzzling tea and miso and praying my box will come before my nipples ice over.

Okay, I'm a firm believer in three strikes you're out.  I gave it two tries, but I couldn't even stomach a third time at this place.    God!!!!  I sooooooo wanted to love this little quirky place that reminded me of the beach stands in the few remaining un-yuppified beach towns in California. Well, the atmosphere is there, right down to the funny guys that work the place.    Food is pretty much like music for me, I like all music and I like all food.  I can pretty much find something good in every meal....but not so today.  I take that back...the salsa verde was some of the best I have had.  First try there....wet soggy flavorless fish tacos.  This weekend, I sent my hubby down for a couple of burritos (recommended by yelp reviewers actually), I knew it was a gamble, and I wanted to be able to give a good review, so I picked something everyone said was consistently good.  The green beef burrito.  Hubby had a hot dog of some sort.  Little had a bean, cheese and rice burrito.    We were 0 for 0.  My burrito....so cold the cheese didn't melt, so big it couldn't even fold and so wet the tortilla melted.  I don't know if it was so disturbing to eat that I couldn't taste it, or if it just had none.  My husband's hot dog grossed me out just at presentation.  He started to make something else and I said, well at least try it, he did and he had to choke it down.  Little has NEVER turned down a bean and cheese but she took one bite and never looked back.    I want places like this to stick around so bad I'm tempted to print out these reviews and mail them to them.  I'm on a bad review streak.  Gotsta find some good eats soon, maybe Golden Buddah for lunch will turn me around!

I must say, I am a picky about my Indian food.  When this place came to Goodyear, I was stoked.  I have been driving over to Bell Road to satisfy cravings for Indian and that was for mediocre satisfaction.  I'm always a bit worried to fall in love with a restaurant, especially in this area, as most are gone within two years...but I did.  I have been to Sutra seven times now and every single time I think "God I hope this place makes it".  This restaurant has climbed to my top three favorite Indian restaurants.  The food is nothing short of amazing.  Each time, a bit different, but always very good.  The buffet is my favorite b/c I like to try all of the flavors.  They have five vegetarian entrees and three or four meat dishes.  There is nothing on the buffet that I wouldn't eat again.  The Tikka Masala sauce is rich and flavorful and is spiced just right.  The Palak Paneer (they call it something else) is also wonderful.  The service has improved since opening and the "son" is very professional and is johnny on the spot.  My drink never went below 1/3 full and I can get in and out in 30 minutes if I need to.   It's the "father" who cooks and I think the recipes he has brought to this restaurant are truly unique.  If you love indian food, or even if you don't, please check this gem out.   And in response to another's comment on seating...it's a nice modern place, well decorated and there is plenty of seating even at noon sharp.  When they first opened they were slammed, but things have settled down to normal business now.  They also have a full bar with some very interesting wine selections.  I take everyone I know there just so they can experience truly excellent Indian food.

Why the low reviews? Their burritos could not be better.  However that is all I ever order so I'm not speaking to the other stuff.  The burritos are giant. In fact I always eat half one day and the other for another meal. The beans are so yum and the creamy rice I'm still trying to copy in the kitchen. If u r not too hungry get the kids burrito meal a light version or a midday snack for around 3 bucks. They have a lemonade bar which is also fun and changes from time to time.  They r busy but always seem to have searing both indoors and outdoors.

Nothing bothers me more than sitting in a wonderful cafe and searching nearby restaurants through yelp, and not finding the one I am in.  This place is hidden in that quirky old shopping maze on the nw corner of Scottsdale and Shea.  As I sit, I wonder, why haven't yelpers sniffed this gem out?  Well I'm in the middle if my babaganoosh now and it's nothing short of the best I've had.  That deep roasted taste that few can pull out of that awful vegetable, has been acheived over here.  I'm not even going to mention the fluffy pita bread because it's still tempting me on the plate.  This is the kind of lunch where you are sad to be alone because you want to share the joy of amazing food. But, I just ordered a to go box to share this with my pals back at the homestead.  So I must have been in the mood for eggplant because I got a pesto eggplant panini with tomato and basil but I had difficulty choosing from this and the caprese panini with balsamic glaze, pesto and sundried tomatoes. I'll have to come back for that one.  This place is Kosher in all senses of the word.   It has all the feeling of a family restaurant down to high attention to detail and customer service.  I hope to see some yelps pop up about a well kept Scottsdale secret.  In the meantime I'm going to introduce them to yelp and make sure we can find them when searching the yelps. Especially when they are the little whole in the walls we are sifting through the corporate eateries in order to keep them keep us sustainable with good food.
