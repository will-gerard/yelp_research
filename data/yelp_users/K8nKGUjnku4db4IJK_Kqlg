We were so excite when they moved within walking distance to our house. I could eat here everyday!  When you can get SO MUCH FOOD FOR THE PRICE!  You could really feed a family of 4 for only $12!

Price are pretty much the same as in Sears store!  Not sure rather spending $50 less at the outlet store for a scratch and dent is worth it!  Normally, an out store gives you more savings than that.....especially if scratched or dented!  I sear store person did tell me that the outlet store are not part of Sears - they are an franchise!  But you can make your own determination on what you are looking for!
