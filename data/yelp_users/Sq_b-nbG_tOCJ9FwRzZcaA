IM IN LOVE. i used to work at joanns and was discouraged by the high prices of fabrics. I then found SAS and was in heaven! The store is pretty organized so it's not hard to find things and for the most part the employees are extremely busy. I could spend hours in there I just wish I had something to make all the time.

I'm not sure why this place is rated so highly. As a girl I love to go to strip clubs. The interaction is what makes it exciting but all you have here is great pole work and dollar "bush dives". No interaction whatsoever other than having a girl put her thang in your face every time you tip them. Then one of the strippers literally came off stage,  made out with the guy next to me, Then she made out with the stripper on stage. This place is trash.

Fantastic place I had a wonderful time. The service was quick and the food was delicious! I especially enjoyed the spinach dip. Our waiter was sweet and gracious. I will definitely be coming back again!
