The hyperbole around this restaurant is unreal.  "Oprah flies in specifically to eat there."  "New York Times and Bon Apetite rate it as the best Pizza in all of the U.S."  "Jimmy Kimmel hired Chris to build a personal brick oven in his own home"  "I ate their once and my eyesite was restored.......praise jesus!"  There is no denying this is great pizza,  All of the ingredients are delicately chosen and prepared by the man himself, and he manages to pull flavors out of each that should not be humanly possible.  If you live in AZ you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.  Steel yourself for a long wait, however, 3 hours isnt much if you've got friends and wine with you,  just dont get too drunk to taste your meal when its finally time to eat.

Brazilian BBQ is not a place you eat,  Its a place you go to test your  manhood.  The salad bar is perfectly serviceable with a variety of different seafoods and small fixings but only serves as a way to line your stomach for the real meal.  Once the peg is flipped to green your endurance challenge begins.  The meat is delivered in no discernible order other than whats hot out of the kitchen,  You're free to turn away anything you don't want (ham) to focus on your favorite cuts, but like I said, This is an endurance test and turning away food is a sign of weakness.  It's not cheap so earn your meal by cramming as much delicious prime rib down your gullet as possible.  Carve off chunks of sirloin, lamb and sausage until you start sweating and then slam down your drink and demand more,  Punish your heart for allowing you to live as long and healthily as it has for so many years.  These animals have given their life for you, make it a sacrifice worthy of the gods themselves.  But please,  save room for the chocolate mousse cake.

If you're looking for a good old fashioned  mom and pop burger joint Rocket's your place.  Cheap, delicious, fresh burgers and sammiches, crisp cut fries, friendly attentive service and a wall of assorted soda's that'll put any other in town to shame.  Rocket doesn't need to be flashy or have a big hook.  It's simple food done well.  If I lived a little closer this would be my default hangout.

I'm not sure if the service department at More Mazda are crooks or just incompetant,  regardless, I couldn't reccomend enough going elsewhere.  I brought in my 2007 Mazda 3 a month ago because it had been shaking badly while driving any speed over 30 mph.  The service department replaced 2 engine mounts for 590$.  After the parts were installed the car was supposedly test driven before given back to me.  Im not sure how that could be as I barely left the parking lot before the shaking began again.  I took my car back again and told them that the repairs had not fixed the problem,  the service advisor told me that they would have to replace my spark plugs and drain fluid from my engine.  Having already spent nearly 600 dollars and not had the problem fixed and being wary of what spark plugs had to do with anything I asked the service advisor very directly if it would fix the shaking issue of my car, I was assured it would so agreed to the repairs for an additional 412.55$  Again, the car was tested and returned,  this time upon leaving not only was the shaking as bad as ever but sometime while my car was in their care my A/C had stopped running.  I returned upset and spoke to the Service Manager who told me that his advisor assuring me the plugs would work was a "misunderstanding" and that the AC was not their fault because he sited a faulty hose as a culprit and said it wasnt in an area they had been working on.  The Manager inspected the car again and told me this time that I would need new struts and berrings to fix the shaking issue. and quoted me a price of 1200$ for the struts and berring and another 300 to fix the AC that they had obviously damaged themselves.  I took my car to a competitor where it was finally diagnosed correctly as a bend axle,  (Something More Mazda had never once suggested any of the times they had looked at it.) and a Compressor wire for the A/C.  (Not the hose that supposedly wasnt in the area they were working on.)  I have one of two feelings about More Mazda:  1.They intentionally ignored what was really wrong with my car in order to bilk more money out of me. And possibly broke my A/C in the process to get more work.  2.They are so incompetant that they could not properly diagnose my car in 3 seperate visits what their competitor did in less than 20 minutes.  I sent an email to their Customer Service department laying out the details of my experience with no reply at all.    More Mazda reinforces every fear you've ever had about a service shop.

When I met Stacy I was in a bit of a hair funk,  It had grown out long and unkempt, I had it tucked behind my ears and frankly I had just given up on caring.  Stacy took pity on me and invited me to her shop to restore my faith in my follicles.    I knew I had made the right decision when I arrived and was offered a glass of red wine with my shampoo,  I dare any one of you to maintain full consciousness  while having a warm scalp rub paired with wine...not possible.  I was a relaxed blob of jelly while Stacy did her magic.     Of course if you can stay awake then you can take part in what is always hilarious and amusing conversation with Ms. Scissorhands.   I look forward to the chuckles, gossip and tom-foolery as much as transformative properties of her hair service.  At the end of the day all the wine, laughs and scalp massages wouldn't mean a thing if your hair didn't look fantastic,  but it does!  Stacy Ann delivers every single time,  You'll walk out not only better coiffed, but just better in general.  I wont go anywhere else.
