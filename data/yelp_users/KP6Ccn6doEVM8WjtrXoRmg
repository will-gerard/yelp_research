I work in midtown phoenix. Da Vang is the perfect lunch get away. Quick service, spacious parking and the most important, unbeatable delicious food. My Summer favorite is their No.37 - Bun with ground shrimp and grilled pork, topped with fish sauce. Will come back again, again and again again...

Terrible customer service. Being told we cannot be seated in 15 minutes, with at least 5 or 6 tables wide empty and plenty of staff walking around.  Never ever come back.

My car AC was broken in June, IN ARIZONA!  NOT FUNNY!  Ray got it fixed within one day. Reasonable price, bottom line guaranteed.  NO hassles , no rip-off.  Recommend this place for anybody who want a major auto repair.

I live close to this place. Used to come several times every week. Shared a dish with my husband and still very filling. Their owner changed about 2 month ago. Kitchen staff remain the same, 10 year old carpet is replaced with tile and the decor looks fresher.  I was and still am a fan of this place. Their authentic food deserve applause.

we live closer to tempemarketplace and fashion sqaure, however we always choose to come this theater. quiet, not over crowded, classic decor and very comfortable chair, close to lots of great restaurants(famous dave, cracker barrel).  feel like a private release for us sometimes!

As a vietnamese food lover, the pho soup of this place seems a little bit modified to me. Not a huge fan. But Their Bun is very tasty. Love it!

I had my 4 wisdom teeth removed by Dr Lamb. The whole process was full of care. I didn't feel too much pain and the recovery was good.   Dr Lamb called me later to follow up.   He is a very knowledgeable and skillful doctor. Take very good care of his patients.

Dr Robert Spence is gentle, caring and very knowledgeable. He has all the good qualities I can imagine for a dentist.

This place literally hooks me up. I cannot stop coming back every week to eat their bun rieu and bun bo hue. Their Bun Rieu is the best in phoenix so far. Very tasty broth. No other restaurant is even close to their level. Very affordable too! 5 dollar only!

This is the best nail shop I have ever been! They use plastic liner for every pedi, which is the only one I have seen in Arizona. Staff are very friendly professional and focused.  Price is very reasonable as well. Will come back for sure!

I ordered a bowl with corn and pork. Cost more than 10 bucks. The food was pricey and you can tell the pork was reheated from fridge. My home made ramen tastes better than this... Sorry to give two stars. Really need some improvements.

So far, I tried durian smoothie 4 times at this place. I am addicted! This is the only place I have been to offers durian smoothie, which can tell you something.  They have All kinds of regular fruits - strawberry, banana, pineapple... They also have all kinds of  exotic ones - Durian, Leechyee, papaya.  The drink is always made out of fresh and price is very reasonable.  My must-go place every time I visit Mekong Plaza.

I tried beef noodle soup, which is a classic Taiwaness dish. The blend of the soup is perfect. Only wish there is a little bit more meat.   Decor is kind of unfinished. However, who cares decor when there is good food.  Cannot wait to come back to try every single dish on the menu.

Few things in a ordinary foodie's life can be compared to the moment at Angry Crab Shack when a bag of seafood arrives the table.

a lovely little place south of ASU.  tried their individual hot pot, which is very popular in east Asia but rare in Arizona.  the pot comes with 6 base options and you can add extra add on. overall, very happy about the experience.

We went the grand opening day afternoon.  I tried the hotdog with everything. (around $3)  Pretty decent price and good portion of food. I am impressed by the fresh ingredients. Every bite is very flavorful.   Saw Mr Dick Portillo walk by in a purple shirt. May God bless him and open more awesome restaurants.
