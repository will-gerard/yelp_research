My first time at Athena Salon and was very impressed. I had the Swedish massage and  Lillian did a great job.

First time here..La Grande Orange Pizzeria blew me away! In fact it was one of the best pies that I've ever had.

pricey but good.  I have always really liked Chick-Fil-A, but don't eat there a whole lot because they are pricier than the other fast food options out there

-No Credit Cards accepted!  -Prices were cheaper than WalMart ONLY by a few cents (not worth waiting in line for a small savings!)  -WalMart will match WinCo's ad. so i am back to shopping at Walmart.
