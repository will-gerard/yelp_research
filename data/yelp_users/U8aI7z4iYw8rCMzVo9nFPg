Been going for to this place for years... the red chile and green chile burritos are the best... the pan is bomb a spot you should check out .....

This is the worst food I have ever had... and I eaten shitty cuisine.... this place Service sucks, beer taste like cold piss, nacho had a dry meat loaf like meat on them... who can ruins quesadillas? ... this place.... plates where dirty, Waitress was slow and the restroom where so dirty no paper towels ... and graffiti everywhere not visiting again... #disappointed
