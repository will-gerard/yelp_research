Normally don't like the car buying experience.  This team was great!  Bill G. was a real pro.  Billy offered a fair deal (after the first low ball offer :( but came around!) and Michael in the finance department was personable and efficient.  No hard sell here!  The transaction went into the evening but they were professional, courteous and friendly to the end.  Great team-oriented environment.  I was treated with respect and care.  Really appreciate the experience.

Terrible.  Lost my sweater.  Couldn't call me back in three months time to correct situation.  Don't recommend.

What an amazing staff!  They have a terrific back room where we had a special surprise party for my daughter.  The staff, including Manager Susan, bent over backwards to ensure the event was a success.  What a great experience!  Great food, privacy, attentive staff and friendly people.  Highly recommend!

I love this place.  It is intimate with the highest quality ingredients, friendly staff and a kicked back atmosphere.  It also feels special because it is so tiny and unmarked.

What a waste!  If I were a red-neck yahoo, I'm sure I actually would have gotten some service here.  Although I was in the market for a kayak and other goodies, it was IMPOSSIBLE to get anyone to help.  After searching the store to try and get someone to ask my questions, you could all but see them all but roll their eyes as I asked questions.  It was like PULLING TEETH to get any help.  I wasn't going to comment until I went to Dick's Sporting Goods and had the opposite experience.  I WILL NEVER GO TO CABELA's again!  A complete waste of my time.

WOW1  What a great experience!  Everyone there was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and considerate.  It was a truly amazing experience!  Compared to my experience at Cabela's I was SHOCKED by the impressive, respectful, and knowledgeable staff.  Prices are fair, people are kind.  What a great place to shop for outdoor and fitness gear!

Nice staff and great clothes but HORRIBLE return policy.  No returns after 14 days.  No exceptions.  I won't be buying there again.

I didn't use them to move but when inquiring about their services, they were honest, friendly, and even gave me good advice!  I like people who do business the way that they do.  No surprise they have 5 Stars!

Best movers ever!  I have moved 23 times in my life and I can say with confidence that Bulwark Moving company with Casey, Caesar and Samuel were just phenomenal!  They took excellent care of my household items, worked quickly, and came in under time and under budget.  I have some very nice art, as well as antiques.  I will definitely use them again!

Terrific local shop with top quality pastries, wines, and breads.  The owner is incredibly knowledgeable about wine and will guide you through the selection while being considerate and down to earth!  I hadn't been before but I will be back!  Phoenix needs more places like French Grocery!

What a disappointment!  While the decor and atmosphere were lovely, the service and food left a lot to be desired.  The hostess was unengaged and trailed behind us.  The server, while initially friendly, didn't bring us basics that were requested and seemed to ignore us when he realized we weren't ordering alcohol.  Finally, the food was uninspired and insufficiently cooked.  My chicken was raw.  I didn't complain because at that point we were all so irritated that I didn't want to come across as obnoxious.  I will not be back.
