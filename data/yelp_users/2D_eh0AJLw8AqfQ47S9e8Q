I stopped in for a nice treat and found Gelato 64 to be very pleasant! I hadn't tried the fruit gelato but went straight for the chocolate and peanut butters. The young lady, Megan, behind the counter was extremely helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. I'll definitely be back!

I use discount tire all the time. I don't really have a choice. The company that I work for uses discount tire to maintain our fleet vehicles. I went over to this location this morning the minute they opened just to get a tire rotation for an upcoming vehicle inspection. The gentleman told me there were only two cars in front of me and he let me know that it would take an hour and probably less. I I watched the time pass and I watched my car sit out front. Finally at the point where I realized it was too late for them to do anything I asked for my keys back and the gentleman who gave me my keys back told me to come back when I had the time to get it done. I told him that I was quoted in an hour and I was told that maybe I should make an appointment because people with appointments take priority.  Thanks a lot. I know it's standard practice in this industry to lie about time but don't do it. Don't tell me an hour if you're not going to deliver within an hour. Now I have to go get chewed out by my boss because my tires aren't rotated. I could have been off getting my oil changed or doing something else that I needed to do. Or I could have just been sitting at home not wasting an hour at Discount Tire. I might not have a choice of what business I have to spend company money at, but I can tell you I'll never be going back to this particular location, even though it is 5 minutes from my house.
