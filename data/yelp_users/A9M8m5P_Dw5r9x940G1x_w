I've been to a good number of these places because they are pretty popular for group dinners in conjunction with meetings and training classes.  Of the ones I've tried, this place ranks in the bottom third mainly because the staff was pretty unenthusiastic (except the bartender), the performance aspects were lacking and the food was uninspired.    It doesn't help that our chef was something of a slob and didn't try very hard to do a good job with our meals.  Sauces were strewn across the table.  A co-worker who is allergic to shellfish had the shrimp appetizer deposited on his plate anyway.  Another co-worker who ordered a combo was given the wrong food.  One of my scallops was accidentally thrown into the mayo-based dipping sauce due to how the chef was slinging hash.  The grill cleaning portion resulted in a significant amount of scrapings leaving the cooking surface and landing on the table surface.  Etc, etc, etc.

When I was a kid, Fannie May was my grandfather's favorite place to take me when my grandmother thought we were at the grocery store.  He knew the product so well that he would tell the little old ladies behind the counter if something was in the wrong place.  He had the markings on the tops of the pieces memorized and knew the layout of the store by heart.  We always got a box to go and a bag to eat on the way back to the house.  Those are memories from my childhood.  I stopped in here and got a bag of my favorites.  This store isn't even in the same area code as the one I frequented with my grandfather but that didn't matter - it took me right back...

I was in Charlotte for business that happened to coincide with restaurant week.  A former customer and mentor was available for dinner and selected this place.  Short answer - it was a great choice!  The three course tasting menu was $35.  Add in a glass of wine, tax and tip and out the door for about $55.  The appetizer I selected included pickled and smoked shrimp.  I certainly picked up on the smoke flavor but the pickling was lost.  Beautiful and well constructed dish.  The entree of my choosing was a seafood medley.  It contained a mix of shellfish and fish but everything matched well.  I especially liked the flavors in the sauce.  Difficult to describe but bright and herbal.  For dessert I selected their flan offering.  Nice, firm custard with a rich sauce and a slight saltiness.  Another winner!

Not the best Embassy Suites I've stayed at but not the worst either.  Maybe the second worst?  The employees were super friendly and answered the few questions I had without pause.  The breakfast was on par with their other properties.  The guest room I was given is where they lost the stars.  The place is in need of some serious updating.  The room I stayed in had definitely seen better days.  The carpet, the light switches, the paint - everything looked tired and just about worn out.  Also, the smell of too-much carpet freshener seriously overpowered the senses.  I thought it would dissipate if I switched the fan selector to "on" instead of "auto" but I was mistaken.  I'm not sure what odor they were trying to cover up but I don't really want to know at this point.  Next time I'm in Charlotte I will stay somewhere else...and hopefully get a better night's sleep.

Certainly not the best Hilton property I've ever visited.  Actually, pretty far from it.  The problems started at check-in when my room wasn't ready.  This would be nitpicking if I had tried to check-in sometime in the early afternoon.  It's pretty inexcusable given that it was after 9pm.  It took about 15 minutes for the girl at the front desk to figure out it would be a while before the room was ready.  She finally offered me a drink from the hotel bar which just happens to be located about 10' from the front desk.  Not so much a bar actually, more like a glorified liquor cabinet.  Needless to say, I accepted.  I'm at a loss for words on that screw-up...  The next day there was a storm and part of the hotel lost power.  In my room, that amounted to no A/C or internet.  Not a big deal except that it took forever for them to get around to restoring both even though other parts of the property were unaffected.  I was able to connect to the wifi but not the internet so I was pretty sure what needed to happen to restore service.  I called down to ask the girl at the front desk to reboot the modem and caught a bit of attitude and a "someone's working on it."  A couple of hours later, I called again and got a different answer from the same girl.  This time, the story was "the electrician refuses to touch it."  The storm rolled through around dinner time and I went to bed at about 11 without having A/C or internet restored.  I found a handful of free breakfast coupons under my door in the morning.  These two problems with the hotel each resulted in a freebie (which I appreciate) but there seems to be an endemic issue with how the place is run.  It's great to try to "make it up" to guests but even better to get things right in the first place and then have nothing that requires an apology.

I kid you not...I stood I line for about a half-hour at 10pm on a Thursday to get a salted caramel brownie.  Know what?  I would do it again!  That brownie may well have been been the best brownie I've ever purchased.  Creamy, gooey caramel atop a brownie cooked to exactly medium-well done such that it was also slightly gooey without being mushy.  Add in just enough salt that you get the texture of a large-grain salt but not so much as to make the thing too salty.  Bliss for $2.49 a piece.  Wow!

I ate 3 meals in Charlotte and this was the best by far!  I opted for a half-slab of St. Louis-style ribs with two side dishes.  Based upon the waitresses recommendation, I went with the fried squash and the green beans.  From bottom to top, here are my thoughts:  Green beans - too much garlic for my taste but I loved the freshness of the beans and that they had not been cooked to the point of mushiness.  Two bites and then I left them alone.  Bleu cheese dressing - a recommended accompaniment  for dipping  the squash and spot-on.  Perfect blend of creaminess and the slight bite of the bleu.  An appropriate amount of chunks of the stinky cheese combined with the savory flavor made this the perfect dipper for the squash.  They make this dressing in-house and it tastes like heaven.  Waitress was on the money when she recommended this as a dipper for the squash.  Fried squash - whoever thought this one up should be given a raise!  This is the first time that I've seen this dish offered anywhere but it needs to be everywhere.  The sweetness of the squash was accentuated by the crispiness of batter.  Also, the slight saltiness paired really well with the aforementioned bleu cheese dressing that my waitress recommended.  I plan to mention this dish to my favorite places that serve ribs in St. Louis in hopes that someone will pick it up and run with it.  The ribs - I love ribs!  I eat ribs in lots of different places to see how the pit masters interpret the pig differently.  These easily ranked in my top 5 favorites of all times.  They use pecan instead of hickory or a fruitwood and it makes for an amazingly complex and savory flavor.  Take a bite and your mouth waters for a second bite.  Take a second bite and the process repeats.  beautiful rub had plenty of flavor but the real star was the smoke.  There were a few different types of sauce on the table but not a one of them got within a foot of these ribs so I can't begin to comment on their attributes.  Go there - get the ribs!!!

"Proper"  That's the first word that comes to mind when reflecting on my experience here last night.  Mainly, that's the first word that comes to mind because that is how Jordan (one of my co-workers) would describe the steak that I ate.  It was most certainly a proper ribeye in every sense of the word.  I rolled in late (as in 40-minutes before closing late) with a group of classmates and we were all hungry and thirsty.  The kind of hungry and thirsty you can only get from a nice, drawn-out corporate training group project that you work on in a hotel lobby from the time your class ends until about 9pm.  Yep, the situation definitely called for a nice expense account ribeye!  My steak was ordered medium rare and arrived exactly medium rare.  From the first bite to the last, I was struck by the incredible wood-fired grill flavor imbued in the meat.  Every single bite had that delicious smokiness!  The meat itself was middle of the road but that was to be expected given the price point.  The smokiness was what carried the day!  My steak came with their loaded baked potato (also good) and a piece of key lime pie.  Actually, it wasn't described that way on the menu but I decided it was a simple editorial error and asked the waiter to make it right.

Fantastic USO location.  Very friendly staff, lots of great give-a-way stuff that the young troops may want to get their hands on while traveling and a very convenient location.  Currently serving or retired?  If so, this is the place to spend time your down time waiting at the airport.  A far better solution than anywhere else in any airport short of a first class lounge...and you meet better people at the USO.

Serious little hole-in-the-wall spot.  They may have seating for a dozen or it may be a little less.  Glad I found them because I had a killer lunch there and it only took about 15 minutes from start to finish.  I walked in for a late lunch but the place was still swamped.  I didn't see a menu board but I did see a sign that instructed me to order at the register before finding a seat.  I asked the guy what was popular and he pointed me towards the Tacos Mexica.  I ordered those and he pointed me towards a nearby seat.  I noticed that the next few people in line behind me ordered in Spanish and took that as a good sign.  Canned soda which translates to no refills but the chips and salsa assortment made up for that.  Their salsas are served in small ramekins, each with a little spoon.  They range from medium to hot and pack a lot of flavor.   The Tacos Mexica are small "street taco" style tacos with a twist: they melt cheese on the corn tortillas before adding your choice of meat.  I went for carne asada, chorizo and al pastor.  I knew that I wouldn't make it through all three and the chorizo was the one that I decided to leave after a bite or two as a little chorizo goes a long way.  Of the three, the al pastor was the one that really stood out.  The pork was succulent and just a little bit spicy while the pineapple brought a delicious sweetness to each bite.  The onions added crunch while the fresh cilantro brought everything together.

Limited selection but they will sell you whatever is coming out of the oven for stock instead of making you wait for your pizza.  Reasonably priced compared to other airport food.  I appreciated the military discount also.  I grabbed a margherita pizza and walked right onto my flight with it.  Once seated, I had a quick piece and it was still a little too hot to eat.  They sprinkled some fresh basil on top before handing it to me and I really enjoyed the freshness of this delicious herb.  Nice bite and chew to the crust and a slight saltiness in the sauce made it a pretty dang good pie in an unexpected place.

The travel gods were really smiling on me today!  First, I dodged the bullet on having to sit next to the world's most annoying preschooler on the plane.  Next, I scored a double upgrade at the car rental place and am driving a little 3-series for the next few days.  Finally, I was referred to this place by a couple of Phoenix Yelpers who were kind enough to respond to my request on the local talk page.  I started with a beautifully fresh salad of locally-grown greens with a delicate dressing.  The star of the show had to be the three olives I found under the greens.  Each one was a slightly different color and flavor.  All were delicious and they were so tender!  Apparently they are from a distributor in California the chef selected based on the quality of their products.  In my humble opinion it was a great choice.  The salad was bg enough to split so I just ate half to save room for the pizza.   Bread service with a really impressive olive oil that also comes from the same distributor in California.  None of that wimpy light-colored olive oil here.  This place is bringing out a richly green olive oil with a fragrance and taste similar to what is found in Europe.  I controlled my bread-loving impulses and limited myself to just one piece to ensure I had plenty of room for the pizza.   Next up... the main event!  The pizza arrived with a sage word of advice: let it sit for 1 minute before digging in.  Based on my view of this pie, that minute probably ranks among the top ten hardest minutes of my life.  I so wanted to dig right in but I hate biting into a pizza too soon and burning the skin off the roof of my mouth.  After feasting, I grilled my server to be sure I really understood the experience.  He has been with the owner for 18 years and is a partner in the restaurant so he nailed every answer to my questions with a phenomenal amount of detail and enthusiasm!  Here are the highlights:  - Sea salt in the dough is responsible for the slight saltiness of their crust.  It is crunchy and chewy at the same time.  Slightly bubbly around the edges and very thin in the middle.  - The wiseguy does not include sauce (olive oil instead - odd in a pizza with sausage and caramelized onions on top of it) but they use a variety of their house-made mozzarella that they smoke in their oven.  If you find yourself inhaling slightly before taking a bite you will pick up the smokiness immediately.  Pretty amazing!   - The sausage is locally produced using a recipe the chef/owner devised.   Lots of fennel here... always a good omen for an Italian sausage being served to a native Chicagoan. They split them,  dress with a little olive oil and then into the oven they go.  After they cool,  they are sliced and used to top the pizza such that they go through the oven a second time and pick up a slight crispness around the edges.  The result is sausage like you rarely find on pizza and pure perfection if you can open your mind to other than bulk sausage appearing on top of your pie...not that I have anything against bulk sausage.   - The Margarita pizza involved a finely-blended fresh tomato sauce that goes on raw and cooks in their 800-degree oven.   - The basil comes from a local farmer who let's it grow until it resembles a bush before harvesting,  thus producing leaves that looked to be about twice the size of the basil I grow at home.  They were very generous with those large leaves and that just served to make the pie that much better.  I was really impressed, Phoenix.  This place would be in the rotation if I lived here.  I'm also glad that I tried their expansion joint instead of the original place because I received far more patience with my questions than I'm sure I would have received at the downtown location.  Sadly, the flourless chocolate cake eluded me - I was just too damn full and happy to eat another bite.

I really, really enjoyed the experience of meeting up with the Phoenix ISC at this place.  It is truly a hole-in-the-wall but they handled our crowd pretty well.  I would have to guess that they have a hard time when faced with large parties but everything came out at roughly the same time and my food was hot when it arrived.  My favorite bite of the night actually came from the Yelper seated across the table from me.  She ordered the mantoo and graciously traded bites with me for some of my kabli pulao.  The mantoo consists of bite and a half sized ground beef and onion dumplings with a meat sauce and a yogurt sauce on top.  I really, really liked the combination of flavors and the presentation was simple yet beautiful.  I would have gladly eaten an entire order!  My entree was a ground beef kebab that was over a foot long and beautifully seared with a really pronounced charcoal flavor.  It came on a bed of Afghani rice which included raisins and carrots.  Savory and well seasoned, it completed the dish.  That said, the beef was a little dry and benefited from the occasional dunking in the yogurt sauce.  I also had a beef samosa that was a steal for a buck.  It came with a sauce that included jalapenos so I had to leave that part of the dish alone.  The others at the table who sampled it had great things to say, including the description of it tasting green.  Plenty of green ingredients and it looked like something I would have enjoyed if it didn't include the one green ingredient I cannot eat.  The samosa itself was just about perfect.  I really liked the addition of several different peppers in the meat mixture both for the flavors they added and the color.  They were fried perfectly and were the right balance between tender and crunchy.  Baklava for dessert, iced tea to drink plus a generous tip and I was still out the door for less than $20.  Thanks again Phoenix for having me at your ISC.  It was a pleasure to meet everyone and I enjoyed the restaurant!

Not a very big place, a dozen regular height tables and about a half dozen high tops. The menu has a blurb at the top which talks about balance.  Balance between sweet and sour, old and new, etc.  I suppose you could almost call this a mission statement because it was evident in each thing I ate.   Here's a nice touch - the hostess dropped off the menu and then came right back with a glass of water.  New one on me but a nice touch.  The waiter appeared a couple of minutes later to take a drink order and instead I asked him for his recommendations from the menu.  He described their duck breast entree in such a way that my mouth was already watering - sold!  While he was talking, I noticed the couple at the next table receive their slices of pie and asked about their dessert offerings.  They must have overheard the conversation because they both gave me a big thumbs-up when he described the process of making the pie the gentleman was eating.    The duck beast served somewhere between medium and medium rare.  I was sliced into about 6 pieces of an even thickness and served over a mixture which included wild rice, spinach, dried cherries, feta cheese, almonds and a mesquite syrup.  When I saw it on the menu it looked like it was a dish that might have too much going on to be enjoyable.  When it arrived in front of me I figured my inkling was confirmed.  I was dead wrong!  The varying tastes and textures absolutely worked together.  Just as mentioned at the top of the menu, this dish was all about balance.  The duck was crispy, salty and tender all at once.  The rice brought another layer of texture while the dried cherries added a certain tang and the mesquite syrup contributed smokiness.  The feta added creaminess and was balanced with the slivered almonds.  Wow!    I have never in my life heard of vinegared strawberry pie.  Apparently, this is an old technique which involves cooking the strawberries well ahead of pie baking and then mixing them into the pie.  There was more to the story which I just can't remember.  What I do remember is the pie.  This really was the most unusual strawberry pie I've ever been served but it was delicious!  The pie itself was filled with a gelatin-based mixture which included the vinegared strawberries in syrup form and a sugary top crust.  Over the top of the pie was a strawberry compote and they finished the dish with creme fraiche.  The first draft had an espresso syrup on the plate but the waiter very graciously removed it when I told him I disliked coffee flavors.  This pie reminded me of eating strawberry shortcake in terms of flavors but not texture.  The texture reminded me of eating pecan pie but without the pecans.  Balance...  Side note: I very much appreciate the recommendations for this place that I received after posting to the Phoenix Yelp talk board.  I probably would not have found this place on my own but I am really glad to have had the experience of dining here on this trip.

Dammit!   I had no intention of buying a new pair of shoes today.   I looked down at my foot after lunch and discovered the sole was separating from the shoe.  Naturally,  this  occurred while on a business trip.   Bekah was the young lady who helped me struggle through the experience of trying to find a pair of shoes which would presumably have a break in period one could measure in seconds.  The last thing I wanted was a pair that would cause blisters when I trudge through the airports on my way home in a couple of days.     They have a much better than average selection of men's dress and dress casual shoes.  I walked out with two pairs and directions to one of their other stores.  I ultimately returned both pairs I bought there after finding a more suitable pair at their other location but that is no reflection of the shopping experience in this location.
