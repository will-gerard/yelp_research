If I could give no stars, I would. I have been a long time fan of KFC chicken.  Tonight I showed up around 7, knowing from experience that I would have to wait awhile for my 16 piece bucket of all dark Original. I ordered at the drive through window, and was told it would be a 20 minute wait for enough dark to fill the order. The girl that took my order asked me if I "just didn't want to have to pay the extra for the white chicken" lol!  Seriously? Anyway, I pulled around front and waited 30 minutes and still no chicken. I went in and waited several minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence. The girl that originally took my order would not make eye contact with me. The manager comes up and tells me that there had been a problem with the fryer, and it was going to be another 10 minutes, did I want a refund or to wait the 10 minutes. I told her that if it was just going to be 10 minutes, I would wait - if the fryer was working and it would be ready. So after waiting 45 minutes for my chicken, it was finally ready. The guy that brought it to my car was nice and apologetic, and said they gave me a cake for the wait. When I got home, I found that the order was half white and half dark. Much worse than that was the fact that the dark chicken was raw!! Bloody and pink. The final straw, however, was when I called the manager, only to be treated rudely.  She wanted to argue with everything I complained about - that I couldn't have ordered all dark, that it cooked for the correct amount of minutes, yada-yada. Needless to say, I won't be back. Raw chicken pictures will be attached if I can figure out how to do that.

Can't decide between Chinese and Mexican food? This is your spot! Black beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken, pollo Diablo, egg fu yung and chile telenovela are all amazing! I love to order the egg fu yung or the chile relleno in a quesadilla, yum! Everything I've tried is great, and I've been going for 20 years or so. Great hangover food!

I am in love! It's been a long time since I have had Vietnamese food. Years ago my favorite, regular spot was the old Avina's at 43rd Ave and Bell Road. Then the owners changed or something and their Pho broth changed and was really pretty gross, and I lost my taste for Pho after so many years of craving it. I read the reviews on Yelp and thought I would give it a try again because I had a cold and was craving the rich, flavorful broth that I remembered.  I went on a Saturday with my boyfriend who had never had Vietnamese food. We walked in and I was immediately impressed with the clean, welcoming atmosphere. They were pretty busy, but we were seated and our drink order was taken right away.   We ordered a Shrimp soup with Won Ton and egg noodles, egg rolls, spring rolls and the fried sweet potato with pineapple, along with a combo noodle dish with beef and chicken. Wow, wow wow!  We got our food quickly and everything looked amazing. The herbs that came with the soup were super fresh, and the broth was complex, so rich and full of flavor, without a hint of greasiness. Everything we ordered was amazing. The Pho broth tasted exactly the same as the original Avina's recipe that I remembered.   I can't wait to go back!!

Ordered delivery last week. We got the Cobb salad and the Ultimate New York Cheese Steak and the Italian beef.  Everything was amazing! Best Cheese Steak ever. The food was hot and fresh, great flavors and generous portions. It was so good we are ordering again today.

I have been going to Carolyn to get my hair done for over ten years. She is amazing!! She does an incredible job at both cut and color and I can't imagine having to go to anyone else for my hair. The best! Definitely a must if you are looking for a new stylist.

Definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  This is my third time here to get the seafood chimi... It is absolutely to die for.

Went back to give it another try. Much better service this time and the sushi was excellent. Very small place - if you go during busy hours expect a wait. It's worth it though!
