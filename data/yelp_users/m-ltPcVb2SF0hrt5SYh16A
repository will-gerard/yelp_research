My wife and I ordered a medium pizza and wings to be delivered 1.5 miles to our home. The lady was polite and said your delivery time will be 45 minutes to one hour. After an hour and 15 minutes I called to ask about the new expected delivery time and the lady said the pizza was on its way. After another 15 minutes I called to check again and the lady was impolite and stated the delivery time had been delayed to 1.5 hours, the current time (would have been nice to know when I ordered the pizza). None-the-less the pizza was delivered an hour and forty minutes after it was ordered. The pizza was not hot/fresh. I won't be ordering here again! Very disappointing cause the Mesa, AZ Barros was great.

The fish was great. The service was also recommendable. However, considering the size and other factors such as location, third floor of a mall, it was not a 5 stars.

The staff is very friendly. The facilities are clean and they get you back at your appointment time. I highly recommend the deep tissue with Krystal!

We have come here a few times for lunch, highly recommend the Tuna sandwich and salad. The food and service is good. I wish they would lower the music around lunch so it is feasible to carry a conversation with friends and colleagues. All

Taco guild has good food, but the real experience here is the very cool building and decor. The guacamole and queso starter is a great place to start.

Kneaders is great! We love their shakes and baked goods. However, the best thing on the menu is unlimited French toast. The employees are always very friendly and the decor is very comfortable.
