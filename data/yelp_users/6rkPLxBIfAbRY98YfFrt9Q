Catherine was not very pleasant, and had a very bad attitude. Maybe I'll come back, but probably not after that. Plenty of other bars to go to.

Taylor cut my hair and I definitely recommend her. I'm a guy who is pretty picky about my hair and she gave me my best cut in years.  I'm going to be one of her regulars now. Seriously, ask for Taylor.

Never eat here.  I worked there for 2 shifts. The mold and the dirt piles up everywhere. The sink that they use to wash dishes is disgusting. They don't even really wash them. There are bugs and trash everywhere. I have no idea how they are still in business.  Can someone please call the health department?!

I love this place. I loved it when it was Mickey's and now it's even better. If you haven't been there, or even if you have, check it out.  SNYDER RULES!!!!!

Great atmosphere, they had awesome live music. Very cool historic Phoenix band called Crystal Haze. They rocked!  I had the French Dip, my girlfriend had the fish and chips. Both were great.  Very friendly staff, the place was well polished. I heard they just opened a couple months ago, so they are doing very well and could become a Scottsdale hotspot.  We will be back soon.
