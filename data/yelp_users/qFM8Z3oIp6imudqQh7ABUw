Yes! The best preparation for a chicken fried steak I have had in Phoenix so far.  With that said the gravy was lacking in flavor.  Whether this was intentional or not, I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on it to taste the gravy.  The atmosphere is what you would expect from a diner.  Trucker hats and outdated memorabilia galore. The best part of the experience was the owner/chef coming out to converse with everyone in the restaurant to see how the food was.  Props for that!  The staff was also very friendly and attentive.    Plan in gaining a pound or two when eating here.  I give this 4 stars for the great home style cooking you would expect from a noted local restaurant.  Minus one star for possibly having a little too high of expectations of the food.

One of the top luxury resort hotels in North Scottsdale.  If you are here on business or just on vacation with family this is an outstanding resort to stay at.  Walking distance to some of the best restaurants in North Scottsdale and outdoor shopping malls.  Expect to pay more than average but well worth the experience.    The golf course here is always immaculate and very well kept.  Never crowded mainly due to the prices they charge.    You are not going to get the true southwestern feel at this resort so if that's what your looking for then head north.  If your looking for fun and food, head south.    Giving this 5 stars because every time I come here I feel like I'm on vacation and never want to leave.

This course is by far one of the top ten courses that must be played when you snow bunnies come out of hibernation.  It is a beautiful course well kepted and manicured throughout the year which is hard to find in the middle of the summer.  Sure you may get a course that agitates on the green but do not let this  detract from the serenity of such an immaculate golf course in norther Scottsdale.  The ease of play and the 5 star amenities and service available at all times makes this top 5 of my favorite golf destinations in the the Scottsdale vicinity.    Not only the golf, but once your done, you have fine dining just around the corner that can please the hardest of souls.    All in all,  if you haven't played this course you must.  Once you do you will have a new perspective of Scottsdale golf.  When your ready to challenge yourself further, head north to some extremely difficult courses.   Cheers!

Surprisingly one of the best golf outings I had in Scottsdale.  Started off with ominous rain clouds with a slight drizzle in the late afternoon.  They let us out to play for $25 each!  And of course we could not say no to the.    Yes it rained intermittently but after the clouds were gone, the rain stopped, then the sunset devoured this beautiful course with all of its natures colors.   One of the most memorable golf rounds I have had in Scottsdale to date.    Make the trip even better by playing the south course to here the top djs play on the weekend.  Once your done baking in the sun head to the pool for some R&R.  Then possible gambling with friends at the casino.  There is always something to do here!  Even if it is a casino.  5stars because it has everything I enjoy on a good day off!

I am a huge Mexican foodie and have been trying Mexican restaurants all over Scottsdale, Tempe and the Phoenix area since I moved down here.  I usually start by talking about the food but holy cow, my server and service was hands down he best I have ever had and deserves notice first and foremost.    I never asked her for her name but got the bill later and it said my server's name was Mercedes so I hope this is the right name.  This girl put a smile on every table I watched her go to every single time including mine.  She was always at each table, at exactly the right time, with what the customer wanted.  Her consolidation skills were off the hook amazing and what I would expect from a high end steakhouse restaurant, not a neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  But the most important thing that stood out was that I felt she loved working there and was happy with her surroundings which usually comes from great management and ownership.   Mercedes was outstanding!    I experience here began even before I met my service.  I'm talking about the hostess that sat me!    When I arrived this place was really busy!  I was a single and the bar was full so I told the hostess and she immediately said "that's ok, we can seat you and sat me at a 4 top during peak hours and no other tables available that I could see!    Menu was what I expected from classic Mexican food.  My staple Mexican dish is the pollo queso or pollo fundido as other places would call it.  #1 thing to look for on a good Mexican restaurant is this dish and all other dishes can be based off of this.  I also ordered my #2 dish, a cheese enchilada a la carte, which is normally what I have to get because my #1 is not on the menu.  Both were good but the up sell and service delivered made me go even further and get dessert as well.  Fried ice cream!  Also great.  I could barely walk out of here I was so full.  Kept thinking this was such a great experience I wanted to order more but just couldn't do it!    Great job guys!  Mercedes, you were awesome!

So I know this is peak season and all but the stoppage and delay on this course was really bad.  During snowbird season this course turns into a geriatric clinic for the wanna be active seniors.  The course ranger here looked like a deer in headlights as if it were his first day on the job.  To his defense, if I had that job (best job in the world btw), who am I to tell people to move their butts at a leisure sport.  This would be all fine and dandy if the course maintenance and views were good.  Here...Dismal at best.  There are so many courses better to play that truly portray what Scottsdale desert golf has to offer.  All in all, if your looking to kill some time golfing and not pay too much, this is your course.  But if you truly want a good golf experience then spend the extra $50 and head up north.

There's a reason this course is one of the most sought after golf destinations in the country.  One word... immaculate.  If your a golf nut and like a challenge this is it.  Sure, you may pay a little more but ask your self how much is your time worth.    Sure, I played one day after a heavy rainfall which is ideal for AZ golf because it softens the ground for ideal playing conditions.  Also, this course (pinnacle) is so pristine that I did not see a single brown patch of grass anywhere and that is rare, especially in AZ.  If your coming to Scottsdale for a golf outing make Troon a priority.  You will not be disappointed.    5 stars every time I golf here.  Bucket list item scratched off.  If it's not on your bucket list...add it!  Ps. if your an ok golfer bring a BOX of balls.  You will lose them every time.  But being at this golf resort you will not care much about losing a ball here and there.

If you blink you might miss this sandwich place.  Went here to try something close to my new office and walking in it looked rather busy.  Service here was on top of their game getting people in and out ASAP!  This the perfect place for a quick lunch on the go.  They also have seating here but I wouldn't count on finding a seat during lunchtime.    I customized my sandwich from one of the menu generics on the board and they got it right with no trouble at all.  Got the feeling they would make any sandwich I asked for which is the best kind of place to frequent.  Rest assured I will be going back for more.  Only reason this is not a 5 star is because of the location.  Hard to find and if you did see it you most likely say to yourself, "let's go somewhere else."

Yes!  One of the best breakfast/brunch places in old town Scottsdale.  This is saying a lot considering every block has a breakfast restaurant to choose from.  I am an eggs Benedict connoisseur/foodie and have to say this is the best in town by far.  There is not one item on there menu that you can go wrong with if you are trying to tame that morning hangover.  This goes very well with the best Bloody Mary's in town, Spicy!    Staff is very attentive and never makes you wait for something you need.  If something is out of your liking, they will correct it in a heart beat.  Expect a wait if you are here during snowbird season and spring training.  Otherwise, come in around noon or early in the morning and you will be treated to a great food experience.

Wow!  What more can I say for this spectacular resort hotel.  This place has luxury written all over it with the location right against scottsdale's famous camelback mountain and close proximity to the ultimate mall shopping experience that is fashion square.  If you want to get away from all the hustle and bustle then I would suggest something up north.  But if you want luxury and all the amenities at your door step, near one the best cities in the country, then look no further.    Also, the 27 hole golf course here is immaculate as is the pool and activities for kids.  Absolutely the best golf course to play if you want to stay near old town.

Great little Mexican restaurant in old town Scottsdale!  Nestled away off Scottsdale blvd so it may be hard to find and is not one of those restaurants you end up walking by as a snowbird tourist.  However, this restaurant, unlike many others in old town Scottsdale, has survived from being torn down, remodeled and renamed something else (like so many others).    The food is what you would expect from a traditional American style restaurant.  This time I had the 3 cheese enchiladas with red sauce that comes with rice and beans. Now, you know your at an old school Mexican restaurant when they offer 10 different varieties of this dish!  Personally, this is what I like.  If you would rather have different varieties of tacos and salads and think you are at a Mexican restaurant then there are others close by.  Just don't expect those other restaurants to be around the next time you come back.

By far one of my favorite restaurants in old town Scottsdale.  Service here is exceptional and the food is to die for.  There are restaurants that boast about having the best of some sort of dish and this place has the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had.  Still have not had a dish here I disliked on the menu so that's saying a lot.   You may expect to have a wait for you snowbirds during those times of the year.  However, the wait is well worth it.  The staff if is on point all across the floor and some of the best I have seen!   5 stars to the staff and chefs that prepare some of the best home cooking plates in Scottsdale!  Also, hats off to the wait staff for providing exceptional service at all times.    Also, ask about dishes that you do not see one the menu ie, grilled artichokes!

Night golf range in Scottsdale?  Yup.  If your a golfer looking for a place to hit balls after work but can never make it in time before it gets dark, then this is your answer.    They stopped taking credit or debit cards recently so plan on bringing cash and the do not have an ATM.  Of course, I asked why this was the case one day and the response was "the owner hates how much credit card and ATM services charge."  Haha.  Immediately, I thought of an old guy on his porch drinking and ranting about the good old days.  Yelling, what's the deal with this webernet nonsense!  I'm an avid golfer and could not give this 5 stars for the aforementioned reason.  However, if your a golfer with a love for the game then you will surely overlook this nonsense and enjoy the fact that your hitting balls on real grass at night.

There is no shortage of golf when you come to AZ.  With that said there are very few membership clubs that are private like Ancala CC.  When you read this review, keep in mind, that I am an avid golfer and I grew up on a Pete Dye golf course.  So naturally, I love this course and his designs.  ASU Karsten is another Dye course here in the valley that is note worthy as well.   Being a CC (country club) you need to know that there are different types.  There are CC's that are Social and Family CC's, then there are pure golf clubs.  This is the former.  If you have kids and a family this is a great place to be a member.  You may even see an occasional celebrity from time to time (not golfers).  If you are a golfer however, you will be lacking the true AZ golf CC experience. There is only 1 private golf club worth it, WRGC (props to you all that know which course this is).  I give this club 4 stars because i have played way better Dye courses.  However, if I had children, this would be my top private club to join here in Scottsdale.

I have found the the holy grail of Mexican food in Phoenix and Scottsdale, finally!  Absolutely the best Mexican food around hands down.  You can always tell when the place has good food before you even walk in.  The old musty smell of the long past cigarette smoke that still looms and the hard to find entrance to heaven.  Decor is the same as it was back when Bush supposedly came here to eat and the menu still has not adapted to integrate any sort of desert menu to increase profits.  That's ok.  Owners must be doing so well they just do what they like.    This is awesome for those old timers that want to keep the bar area a social gathering for over the hill drinker regulars.   As a suggestion, add some desserts to the menu and make it more of a family establishment.  The bar can stay separate of course.  But the food here is too good to limit to just old has been regulars.    Trust me when I say new generations will appreciate the delicious food served here and the ambience.    Get desserts!!  Bring the kids!  :)

This is my kind of crowd!  With that said, I enjoy a place to relax and hang out at after work.  Not quite a dive bar, per se, but a place to come to that knows who you are.  Like cheers...Norm!  Right in the middle of the old town bar scene.    Prices on food and drinks are as you would expect for a place that has outlasted every other establishment in the area...less expensive and reasonable.  $3 for draft and $3.50 bottles and $4-6 for mixed drinks on the weekends.  Happy hours are the best here.    They only have your traditional bar food (nachos, burgers, chicken fingers, etc.) but that is why I like this place.  The food is ok and I only say that because this is old town Scottsdale.  If your hungry, go to a good foodie restaurant nearby.  FYI they are everywhere!  If your thirsty and just want to chill this is the place to visit!

This is my first collegiate baseball game I have been to without actually being in the game as a player which is saying a lot.  I drive home from work through the back side roads of south west Scottsdale to get to and from work and drive right by the sun devils baseball stadium.  AZ wildcats vs Sun devils so I had to check it out!  The stadium is right next to Papago Sonoran desert habitat and the desert botanical gardens both of which are worthy of seeing on their own.  However, this is a great ball park!  Plus, it is not a dry collegiate stadium!  All be it, expensive to drink here, but having one or 2 beers here to relax after work was worth it.   The reason I did not give this 5 stars was because I felt the collegiate atmosphere was lacking a little.  Ball player's friends, girlfriends, parents and people who just love to watch baseball were there, but not in the numbers I expected in a city known for its baseball talent.  I see talented players from Phoenix/Scottsdale going to much less credible schools than ASU, academically, and I'm left wondering why?  If you are a ballplayer from here with a scholarship to Stanford, Georgia, or Texas, I can understand leaving and going elsewhere as your talent may take you places.  Otherwise, why on earth would you want to leave one of the top ranked party schools in the nation!?

Oh how I love chick family a!  It's almost like walking into in and out.  You know your body is going to be so happy soon you can't wait.   I get 3 piece chicken strips along with a chicken sandwich.  Of course, I have to get the real lemonade as the drink because there is no other better tasting lemonade anywhere.  The sated is always on point and super polite with every customer I have ever seen come in.    I have yet to find a chick fil a below 5 stars and I'm not going to disappoint anyone tonight.  Way to be on your game today staff and the food is, as always, delicious.  Please open a store in old town Scottsdale.  I would be glad to take the role of GM for this restaurant and make it #1 in America hands down.  To management, I dare you to take me up on that!  Lol no joke. Cali has nothin on AZ!  Boom

Reminded me of one of those bars in Boulder CO that made an executive decision not to update the place in fear that it would lose its character.   Character here on a fri night was more like we're the older hippies came to as a last resort.  No one else would take them!  Their too old said Scottsdale.  All they need is a hot tub time machine and this place would be packed!    Wings were out of this world delicious by the way.  Brews were good too but you can find so many other great brewing restaurants.  If you want to get away from the ASU scene this is the place to do it.    Cheers

Brews were good too but you can find so many other great brewery restaurants nearby that this would be a waste of your time.  If you want to get away from the ASU scene this is the place to do it.  If you want a good brewery keep looking.    Cheers

My top 3 breakfast/brunch places in old town Scottsdale.  If you haven't been here it's because it was too busy to get in or you you wanted to try something more corporate like village inn or Denny's.    This is Scottsdale breakfast/brunch at its best!  Very few restaurants are in the same echelon as this place.  A must go to for all you new snowbirds!  If this place doesn't make you come back every year then you should stay in the snow and cold.

Came here for the food which is above average when it comes to bar food.  If your tired of the old town club scene and looking for a relaxing place to wet your whistle this is a great place.  You will not find a bunch of 20 something's dancing on tables here.    Had the chicken wrap with side salad which was great and the price was even better at $9.29.  The drink prices are also way below average for the location.   All in all a good place to come and have a drink or 2 and skip the crowds and over pricing of old town scottsdale.

Do you ever walk into a store and feel like a kid in a candy shop?  That's what this place does to me!  These stores have everything you could imagine for golf.  Even if I am only there to get 1 thing, I still spend an hour there each time!  Apparently, this is the highest grossing revenue and most trafficked of all the PGA Superstores and is considered the flagship location.  Not surprising considering its in Scottsdale.  They also do the majority of training for their managers and PGA instructors here.  Which is cool because this means there is always someone knowledgable here to help answer your questions or get work done on your clubs right away.    If your a savvy consumer you will also notice that they stock a lot of merchandise and whatever the tourists (or my new word for them - snow drifters) don't buy, it is all marked down at some point or another.  All in all, if your a golfer in Phoenix you most likely have been here at least once or twice.  But if you haven't been...GO!

This is officially my very first review on Yelp!  Was able to get onto this course during peak season for fairly good price considering the cost of other top courses around Scottsdale.  If your staying at the resort and your a golfer this is a must do if you have the time.  The views from the course are some of the best you will see of Phoenix and Scottsdale.  This is also a great desert course nestled along one of phoenix's most popular trail parks on south mountain.    Could use some course maintenance here and there which is why this is not a five star.  However, the resort is one of the best examples of higher end southwestern resorts in Phoenix which is why this is not a 3 or 2 star.

Snowbirds!  Listen up...if you want a fun night to unwind and have fun gambling, this is the place to be.  Hotel accommodations are great if your staying in Scottsdale.  Sure, there are other Indian casinos to choose from, but this is by far the best one in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Also, this casino has the best poker room by far! Night life is great as well.  20 and 30 something's love this place and the club gives some of the best views of Scottsdale's sunsets anywhere.  Food here is what you would expect from a casino and very similar to Vegas (casino food).  Cheap and fulfilling.  I give this casino 4 stars because they have the largest poker room, best pool in Scottsdale, club style night life and decent food choices.  Minus 1 star because it is not quite Vegas standards with no Craps tables.

If you are a burger connoisseur and looking for a great atmosphere this is a must do!  Right next to old town Scottsdale which has burger restaurants  everywhere you look.  But if you are looking for a relaxing, resort type atmosphere, look no further.  Yes, you will spend more than your average burger place around town but you also will not have to deal with the 20 something ridiculousness that happens in old town.  Making this one of my favorite places to get a burger especially if you just finished a round of golf at the Phoenician.  If you have young ones they will enjoy this meal as well.  The desserts here are absolutely awesome (I'm talking mainly about the open fire s'mores and shakes!  Yum.)  Honestly, this is a 4.5 star rating for me just because of the price.  But when you want to feel like your on vacation then do it!

Walked into this branch to open a checking account today and have to say this was the nicest experience I have ever had at bank.  First off, there were no lines at the counter.  The cashier prompted me to have a seat to have one of there managers come help.   As I was on my way to sit down and wait (like I do at all other banks) the manager was right there to greet me and ask how he could help.  Pleasantly surprised I walked into his office and told him what I needed.  He asked me a couple questions and before I knew it I had a checking and savings account.  Done!  Not sure why I never banked here before but rest assured I will be going back to this location for all my banking needs.  Juan the manager was polite attentive and on top of his game.  5 stars for Juan and his staff.   Keep up the good work.

Love this breakfast spot and that's saying a lot considering old town is packed with so many great breakfast/brunch places to choose from.  Would have to place it in my top 5 for this category when looking for a great breakfast place in old town.    Staff is quick and responsive especially when your food comes out wrong or contrary to your liking.  This has never happened to me here personally but I have seen it happen to others around me each time I have been here and it is the reason this review is not a 5 star.  Personally I think they just need a better order system or another cook in the back but still a must try despite their shortcomings with orders.  Also, if you plan on coming here during peak breakfast hours on a weekend, forget it!  You will wait for at least a half hour.  But worth it if you have the time.

Ah, yes!  If your in old town, looking for a great round of golf, look no further.  3, 9 hole courses that are equal to none within 10 miles.  The staff is the best at accommodating you and your group which is expected from a high end golf resort.  What makes this golf experience different are the views!  Both the Phoenix and Scottsdale skyline are seen from these courses right on the base of Camelback mountain.  If you get to choose the courses (3 nine hole courses) then you must play the desert course at dusk to see the sunset over the city.   Expect to pay a little more if your snowbird during peak season or if your not staying at the Phoenician resort as a guest. This is a luxury resort and you will will be treated as such when you visit here.  All in all, one of the best golf experiences Scottsdale has to offer and well worth the cost.

Hands down the best barber shop in old town Scottsdale.  The location may surprise you at first but don't let that fool you.  If you have had a cut by these guys before you know how good they are and you also know that these guys love to talk and converse with their clientele.  When I say converse, I  mean anything and everything.  Guys talk on overdrive!    That being said, if your in need of a good, short, quick cut this is the place to go.  Just make sure you bring your debit card because they do not take credit cards.  Also, these guys are the masters of the guido/meat head cut.  What I mean by that is they will cut down to the bone if necessary to get a close cut and make you look good.  Everyone walks out looking like a good looking jarhead.  So, if that's not your look go elsewhere.   $20 for the cut and you have to pay in cash.  No cc machine there.  Tax reporting must be something I would never get involved with here.

Broncos fans this is the place to be for game day!  Home of the Broncos in the desert and I have to say there is no better place to host Broncos football.  This is a country bar with live country music bands that play every now and then.  Great thing about this place is the location, smack dab in the middle of old town Scottsdale's nightlife.    They also have a ton of tvs to view any event from any angle in the the bar including a 2 story projection screen on the back wall.    Food is your typical bar food with a hint of country style.  Good meat selection with the traditional BBQ flavors.  Overall good food considering the options around the area but a little higher in price than I would like to see.  However, if you check in here, you get a free appetizer for the table so take advantage while it lasts.    I give 4 stars for being an awesome place to host the Denver Broncos.  Minus 1 point for being slightly overpriced and at times very difficult to get to the bar to buy drinks when it is busy.

Best Burger in old town in my book! If your craving a burger, and you have been here before, this is sure to be the first place you think of.  If haven't been here yet, this is a must try.  Prices on everything are very well priced from the cold beers to the cheeseburgers! Haha    I always have great service here and have never been disappointed.  Prices are awesome too especially if you use yelp!  Hint.    If I was to say anything against this place it would be for the wait to get in sometimes.  This is a sports restaurant/burger place with tv's throughout showing sports 24/7 so this may not make for a good date place.  If your girl likes rabbit food and you get distracted by sports go elsewhere.  Also, if your a snowbird, with a big group, plan on waiting a bit for a table.  The burgers and atmosphere are worth it!

Wish it still had the pool!  That way I would forget about the food that was served here and just keep having fun.  In its defense, if your looking for something just outside of the old town madness but still willing to pay a premium for drinks and so so food, this is the spot!  You are sure to get a seat here every time no matter the night or occasion.  Just be sure you remember the location if you plan on coming back in a year as this place will most likely be named something new.  Most places in old town try to revamp themselves into new and exciting places yet this one fell short again as did its neighbor.  In the 2 years I have been going out in old town Scottsdale these 2 locations will have been 5 different names between the 2 of them!

Best chicken fast food anywhere.  I've said it it before and I'll say it again,  Chick-fil-A has the best chicken sandwich and chicken fingers in the fast food industry.  I wish there were more chick-fil-a locations which is one of their drawbacks.  But when you find one near you it's like having the best day ever!    This is a newer location that just opened in north Scottsdale.  I give this the 4 stars for the same reason I give all Chick-fil-A locations 4 stars, lack of locations and not being open on Sunday's.  The one day I crave fast food from an overwhelming weekend and they are closed!  Argh!

Blue fin toro...yup!  I have not found another sushi restaurant in old town Scottsdale that has it!  It's not just the cuts either.  The chef has been one of my favorite sushi chefs since I have moved here 3 years ago. Formerly working at another very popular sushi restaurant north of their current location.  J has been so successful that he opened his own restaurant due to a great fan base and superb sushi.    I would recommend this sushi restaurant over any other sushi restaurant in Scottsdale just for the quality of the food and cuts.  If your looking for a sushi restaurant that is yuppie and pretentious there are others to choose from and way more over priced.  But here, you really do get the Japanese food experience.    I give J 5 stars for their outstanding sushi, sashimi and other great dishes.  If you can't find the restaurant it means you have never been here and do not live here all year round!  So follow the map and come in.  Your welcome!

Still the closest bar to where I live where everyone knows my name and my beer is at my fingertips before I even get to the bar.  I am sure to find my friends here in some form or another.  If not, this is a great place to chill for sporting events or rock out on Sunday to whatever garbage/industrial punk rock group they have playing.    5 stars because I love hanging at the yelp frat/sorority house which is this place and seeing friends.   Food is also very good indeed.  Congrats to the remake of the menu.  Perfect!  Gotta check it out at least one.  If it's not for you,  you might be in the wrong part of Scottsdale altogether!  If this is your water hole of choice it's hard to go wrong and I salute those that patron such a classy place for us happy hour binge drinkers!

Also the bartender in the back, goes by Mckenzie, is one of the best bartenders I have ever had the privilege of being served by.

This isn't far the Most luxurious lease option in old town if your not ready to buy.  If you have the money, and not ready to buy yet, this apartment complex is the newest and most updated.  Stainless steel appliances, w/d in units, granite counters, garage or underground parking, etc.  I know I sound like a real estate agent but this is where I want to live and I like nice things!  Price ranges from $1,450 - $3,800 depending on # of rooms, which floor, view, and anything else you can think of that property management will squeeze money from.  With that said, this is still the absolute nicest and newest place to be in old town Scottsdale.  Again, if your willing to spend this kind of money, either you are looking for a house to buy or you are just temporarily in Scottsdale.  You can buy a $450,000 home for these rental prices.  So keep that in mind.  If you want the same opulence and luxury this place has to offer in a home you will be looking at price ranges near $650,000.    People and tenants here seemed nice yet uppity.  Kind of like being at the Ritz or Four Seasons without the old people and families that are on vacation.  Young well off 20 and 30 something's.    If this is your style go take a look.  Well worth it if you can justify the price."

Hippest place to go for loud and fun times.  Formerly  the north end of Maya cabanas, is now the epitome of old town Scottsdale fun!   Where do we go after college is over?  Here of course.    DO NOT go here if you are looking for a relaxing and quiet lunch or dinner.  If you bring kids near this place you might be a kid still yourself.  This is a place for EDM goodness and loud DJ's.  PS: forget about ordering food here unless you are too wasted to walk but just ok not to be kicked out.  Takes forever and they most likely will send your food to the other side of the bar.  However, if you do get the food, Congrats!   You have managed to not pass out before your food gets to you!  The burgers here  are very tasty especially if you have been basking in the sun all day at Maya's pool!

Awesome movie theater!  Nuf said.  Ok so a little more.  Located in the new section of the mall on the NE side.  Huge inside with full bar and even a deck overlooking Scottsdale Rd to hang out at.   This in itself is cool enough to just come and hang out if you wanted to.  But I'm pretty sure you need to get a ticket to get in.   Refreshments as you would normally see any other Harkins theater.  Difference is there's Liquor here...yay!  Coolest thing about the theater is you have seats you get to pick yourself before you even get in.  This is good so you never have to wait in a line to get a good seat.  Once your inside, every seat is leather and electrically reclinable.  Leather chairs, popcorn and a beer or 2?  I'm sold.   Awesome experience and now my favorite theater in Scottsdale.
