I love this place, I have been coming for over a year now. It is so hard for me to find a nail place that I like and can consistently do a good job on my manicure and pedicure. I come every two weeks, they know me and know what I like. Now they might not be he perfect fit for everyone, but once they get use to you and know what you like and dislike you won't be disappointed.   The staff is small so I recommend to make an appointment. They are friendly and fun to talk to. Now I don't get a full set so I can't comment on it, but most people I see are happy with their results as well.

I really enjoy the food here, isn't the best but pretty good. I ordered the shredded beef tacos and they were not greasy like most places. The rice needs a little more flavor, but beans were good. The only thing that shocked me was they charged for the chips and salsa, I mean isn't that a law to always provide chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant?!! Either way the salsa is good, not to hot and full of flavor!!   It's a cute establishment and have friendly servers. I did notice the service was a little slow though, it wasn't busy at all so no excuse.

So I was looking for a spot to get a quick snack before the gym. I remembered a little place around the corner I use to go to all the time when I worked in the area. I was happy to see it was still there.  If you didn't know it was there, it's easy to miss. They now have cute but unusually looking set of chairs and tables outside now with umbrellas. (So don't miss it) I always think it nice when you have the option to sit inside or outside when the day is nice.  I didn't try any of the food this time but did try a smoothie. There are limited flavors but I must say the mango smoothie is amazing!! It taste exactly like a mango, not to sweet and very flavorful!! My friend got a pineapple coconut smoothie. She let me try it and that was good as well. I would definitely recommend it over a chain smoothie establishment.

I've tried a lot of Vietnamese places and so far this is the one I keep coming back to. Everyone is in a friendly mood and the service always seem to be good, even if it's busy.   Everything I have ever ordered has been great! This time I ordered #36, which is basically pork, rice, over easy egg, egg cake and cucumber slices. The meat was lean and marinated well. The only thing I didn't really like was the egg cake, never have... So not there fault. My friend ordered #39, grilled chicken and rice. It was her first time eating there and she loved it too. She is always picky about her food, but she was pleased with the outcome.   So overall it was a great experience!! Plus they have my favorite, Vietnamese coffee!! =)

I've been coming here for years!! My friend took me here for my first time and I have been hooked ever since!! LoL  It's is a small establishment that has been remodeled. Right when you walk in you are greeted by the family like staff, very welcoming. I'm not sure, but I think it's family owned. I always see the same guy making the sushi and pretty much the same waiters/waitresses.   Now for the food. I think the portions are perfect, especially for the price. It's hard to find great tasting sushi that doesn't cost outrages amounts. I mainly get the sushi here so honestly I can't express how I feel about the other things on the menu, but I'm sure they taste just as good.  I definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers and people new to sushi. Don't mess up your first sushi experience, you could be scarred for life!! LoL Oooohh and they have a Happy Hour too!!

Halo-Halo is hands down my favorite Filipino restaurant in Arizona!! I have tried many Filipino restaurants and have been disappointed with most. This is not the case when I come here.   If you are new to the food or have been raised on it all your life, you will definitely enjoy your experience here!!   The selection of food is amazing and everything seems to always be fresh. By chance if what you want is not available at the time, they have no problem making it for you.   They also have a large seating area, bakery items and a karaoke night!! Every time I come here I feel welcomed by the friendly staff and people around me. I recommend this place anytime someone ask me for the best Filipino food in Arizona.

I love the Katsu chicken from here!! It's always seems to be just right, pair it with rice and macaroni salad you have a pretty good meal.

I started coming here because my doctor moved here, Dr. Paige Walend. I love her, she has been my doctor for over 15 years now. As far as the facility I think it is like most; it is kept up nicely, offers a large variety of magazines and a cute play play for children. The front desk staff is nice and seems to get the job done. It could be me, but they are very talkative with me. They are always talking to each other and sometimes don't even acknowledge me.

I went here with a friend, she really wanted to try it. We have tried a lot of Ramen places and were hoping we found a new hot spot. This was NOT what we expected. We both ordered differently (floating) and both were very disappointing. They basically tasted the same. I got three pieces of beef and most of her pork was just white fat pieces. Yuck...  On the other hand we also order the Gyoza and Shrimp Tempura. Those where pretty good, but the price didn't match. I got three pieces of shrimp for $4. But hey this review is for the taste not the price.

I got there around 7:20am, because my rental pick-up time was 7:30am and I had to be at work by 8am. The doors didn't open until 7:30am and when I got inside they still had to open everything and get the computers running. I feel like things should be ready and on time if you offer pick-up times of 7:30am, but I get it.  When we went to inspect the car she offered me an upgrade for a little more money a day. My dad had an upgrade pass, so she let us use it to help with the upgrade and I was able to pay $4 more per day instead of the higher amount. She was helpful in showing me all the features of the car and I was on my way. Good experience.

I came to Dr. Marquez after being in the hospital for almost a month. I was having really bad leg cramps and tingles in my feet. Not to mention my back was messed up from being in that horrible hospital bed!!   After a few weeks with Dr. Marquez I was feeling much better, no more cramps and tingles!! Yay!! She continues to do a great job with me and really cares about my health. She helps out whenever she can and answers all kinds of questions I have concerning my health.   The atmosphere is fun and I love how she decorates the office, feels very much like home. Also I can't forget Chrissy, she runs the front office great!! Always happy and smiling. Oh and I forgot to mention you are able to get massages there as well, great staff all around. I would definitely recommend this place.

I love Greek Food!! So I've tried a lot of places... The prices may be. Little higher but a few more dollars aren't bad for the food food you will receive.   This time I got the Steak Shawarma and the meat was so flavorful, didn't need sauce or anything. I usually eat it with Pita and the Tzatziki sauce. Favorite!! The Greek Fries are always good, can't really mess those up. Iran they could have been a little more crispier, but with all the ingredients in them they are bound to get soggy.   The place seems to be fairly busy, I'm never the only one dining in. Also the staff is friendly and fun!! I mean for being a "food court" food establishment, it's better then most. I go often and would recommend it if asked...

So being very hungry me and my friend Sally set off for a grand adventure to find a breakfast place. As always we go right to Yelp and see what places have good reviews. We decided to come to Mark's Cafe since it was near by had good reviews.   When we first got there it was packed, so we thought that was a good sign. It was a nice day outside so we sat outside in the front. We waited a little long for service, but the waitress was really nice and explained it was just a weird day and we don't normally have to wait that long.   I ordered the Country Frittata with Potatoes and an English Muffin. I would say get the sauce on the side. My friend got the California Eggs Benedict with potatoes. We also shared one banana and pecan pancake, that was so good!!   We had water and hot chocolates as well. The hot chocolate was the perfect temperature. The only thing was when you got to the end of the drink it was very sweet and had thick chocolate at the bottom.   Great service and friendly establishment. Family own and makes you feel welcomed!!

I came with some friends (guys and girls) for New Years 2014!! We all had an amazing time!! The guys did not have to pay an arm and a leg to get into the clubs either, definitely got a great hookup!! If you want your Vegas experience to be well worth it, you have to contact Evan Wallace!! Thank you Evan!!

I came with a friend for breakfast. She ordered the "Classic" breakfast burrito and I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl Franchise Toast. I had some of my friends burrito and it was amazing!! As for my French Toast, it looked amazing but a little on the dry side. The topping and overall appearance were good. I think because the actual piece of toast was so thick, it tasted more like a loaf of bread. This was my first time here and I loved it. It's a small hidden gem, that showcases local artwork as well.

Depressing to only give ONE STAR, but it was terrible. I've been reading pretty good reviews about this place, so I took my parents for a quick bite to eat while running errands.   Manilla Sunrise Gourmet is tucked away in a shopping plaza in West Mesa. It's a small, but cute establishment. When we walked in it was a little crowded, so we were thinking the food must be good. After reviewing the menu we noticed they didn't have to much to choose from. The food under the hot lamp looked a little "old." We ordered 4 different things; Picadillo (Giniling), BBQ Pork, Ribs and Shanghai Lumpia. All left us disappointed and still hungry!! =( The Giniling was oily and the ground beef tasted raw. As for the BBQ and Ribs, it seemed as if they just came straight from the grocery store freezer, no real flavor at all. Also the ribs seemed to have a coating of oil on them. I figured the Lumpia would be better. Who can really mess up lumpia, even if it was store bought?!! Well they managed to mess it up anyway and burned it. As for the rice, it was soggy. To top it off we happened to get some of the "morning" rice and new rice mixed together... Blahhhhh!!   I heard they have great dessert, Halo Halo and Turon but after my experience with the food we decided to just skip it. It seems there are NO GOOD FILIPINO places on this side of town!! I will continue to make the long journey to the west side to eat at Halo Halo!! (35th Ave and Dunlap) They are by far the best in AZ!!   As we were leaving we noticed all those people taking up the table and chairs, were either family or workers. Go figure!! LoL

Everytime I come here, I am never disappointed. The fruits are always fresh when I get the bowls. My favorite is Just Acai and the Original. The people are always friendly and the service is quick. I mean it does get busy, because it's a pretty popular place but for the most part it's quick service. Oh and I love the fact it's open till 9pm.

I love this place!! Great food!! They put a twist on traditional island food. Food was on point and full of flavor. I would say though, I was disappointed then ran out of the dessert I wanted!! Brownie with MacadamiaNut Ice Cream!! Server was good, checked up on us quite often and always made sure our drinks were full!!

Me and my friend love Greek food. The food is great here and trust me, we've tried a lot of places.   The Greek fries are always... ALWAYS on point!! They make them crispy so fries don't end up soggy. I had my steak medium well and it came out perfect, full of flavor. The salad was ok. Besides the regular fountain drinks, they have a couple options of really good brewed teas and different coffees.   I haven't tried the desserts but they look really good and I have heard good things. Certain evenings they had live music. The atmosphere is very welcoming. They also have an outside seating area with a heater for the chilly nights. The only thing I have to say is prices are a little pricey. Overall I would recommend this place!!
