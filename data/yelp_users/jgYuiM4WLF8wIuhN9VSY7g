The husband and I love coming here . We love the burgers ( sweet jalapeño) , focaccias, and the golden wings ! Nothing fancy, but just good food and fun place to play pool or watch a game . Sometimes service is a little on the slow side, but good late night  happy hours !

So the first time we went to this place, my boyfriend and I went with a couple friends and thought the food wasnt amazing but it was decent and close to home making it more convienent. Not tonight, first we were told to choose our own table (mind you all of the tables were empty, who would have guessed?) then once i chose a table which was a four top, i was rudely told that those werent availible and shoved into a two top which was ackwardly positioned against a brick wall. We asked after a couple minutes of sitting there to be moved to the empty space at the sushi bar, our server was kind and said no problem and moved us there, thats where the problems began. We had a clear view straight into the open kitchen. I forgot to mention that my boyfriend is a chef and knows just a little bit about how things should go down in a kitchen , whether it be sanitary or productive. Lets start with a minor issue. They were using the same cutting board, and knives to cut raw beef, raw squid, and vegetables (dirty unpealed carrots). The food came out fairly quickly, which was nice but did not seem to taste at all how we remembered. The spicy tuna  tasted off , not  quite spoiled, but poor quality fish. There was a roll with huge chunks of red bell peppers that just didnt seem to taste right with the shrimp tempura , maybe a little piece but not an overpowering chunk. Then it took forever for our server to even check back on us because all their employees were to busy eating, texting, and talking all in front of customers plain view without a care in the world (where is the manager? maybe texting in back?)Which didnt seem to unsanitary for servers to be doing but then when the sushi chefs are texting with there gloves on while making food it becomes a sanitation problem . Who knows where there phones have been ? It also to almost 20  minutes to be noticed after done eating to get a check? which is definetly a problem in a slow resteraunt where we see them chatting in back . We both have worked in the food and beverage/customer service  industry for many years, and always seem to be good tippers but in this instance we just could not give a 15% tip for such a terrible experience. None the less, we will not be coming back to Moira ever again. Im only giving this place 2 stars so i dont look like that ass that only gives them one star cause the food didnt taste horrible , especially not the first time we ate here.

Amazing pizza! So glad we found this place. Try the diavola pizza, nothing can replace San Marzano tomatoes!:)

I had low expectations coming here but was pleasantly surprised ! The pizza was actually good , and I liked how thin it was making it a nice light dinner . You can also put as many toppings as you want and it's the same price ! I built my own with half red sauce half  pesto topped with mozzarella, salami, pepperoni , garlic and basil ! I will be back . :)

We really like this place ! They really pay attention to hiring staff that's provides great customer service . We have tried many things on the menu but the flat bread with borson cheese and mushrooms and the bruschettas stand out the most ! The only reason I'm  giving 4 stars is because one experience there ( on my husbands birthday ) was not pleasant . They brought us out sides and never brought us our  entrees and server took a long time to acknowledge anything . But  it was also super busy and it was a very new resteraunt , and they were vey apologetic and made up for it . Other than that it's a great place to go for some good apps and has good environment !
