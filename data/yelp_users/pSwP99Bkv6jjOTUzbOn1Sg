In 10+ years, I have never had a bad meal or experience at Bandara. A lot of love goes into their food and it comes with great ambience. Best beef ribs in AZ.

noca went from being one of my top 5 restaurants in AZ to having a 1 and 5 chance of my ever returning or recommending. After making sure to mention on the Open Table reservation my special request for gluten free dining as well as a clear, understandable conversation tableside with my server prior to ordering, it was obvious that the front of the house lacks knowledge about what a gluten free diet entails.  The back of the house also has a lack of creativity about keeping the spirit and integrity of their dish when accommodating a gluten free request.  The communication between the two is noticeably weak.  Who would have thought that cooking without flour would be so difficult when everything noca prepares is made to order?   Is frying an egg without crusting it that challenging?  Missing this simple awareness makes those with a gluten intolerance feel as if his or her dining experience is not as important as those without food aversions. Overall, the quality and value have all gone downhill as far as I'm concerned.  There is no attention to detail and appreciation of a well timed, elegant dining experience.  Forced, insensitive and rushed service makes for a very angst-ridden, uneasy evening.

I had three local companies evaluate my a/c which was acting up: Parker & Sons, AccuTemp & Flores.  Parker & Son's are crooks - the evaluation was a complete overhaul of my system with a price of over $3,000.  AccuTemp -The contractor gave me an accurate overview of my a/c problem...but took a long time to evaluate and explain what was going on. By the time he wrote my estimate he noted that they charged by the half hour....two hours later @ $75 an hour. This disturbed me becuase I was given a flat price evaluation quote over the phone. His price after evaluation was $1,700. Another scam artist of a company.  Flores - Lastly, I had Flores come for a service call. Their technician came the same day as AccuTemp. He had a few problems with the timing of our discussed schedule and could not find my address right away (It took a few phone calls to explain where I was). But when he showed, he was polite, went right to work and performed the standard checks at the unit, in the attic and at the drips. His prognosis was the same as AccuTemp's - basically, some minor repairs. This is where it gets amazing...when I asked him to write up the overview and price it out, he explained that there would be no cost and that he did the work as he was evaluating my system. He also explained the how and why about the problems I was having with my system. While most companies tell you that you need a new system at 7-8 years - he disagreed and told me that under good service they should last 10+. Then he simply told me to call him when I needed another repair or a new unit. This guy and his outfit is a class act. I will be calling them, and no one else in the future.
