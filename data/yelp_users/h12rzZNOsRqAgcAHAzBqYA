I've grabbed dinner to go here a couple times in the past few months. I was excited to find another inexpensive mexican restaurant close to where I live. Most of their food seems pretty salty...I could live with about half the salt and I like a lot of salt But the spicy beef (#9) lived up to it's name. If you like spicy food I'd highly recommend trying the #9. Considering that Amados is just a couple minutes away, I probably won't try this place again.

After living in the valley for four years I finally found a vet I like! I had a wonderful vet for six years before moving to the valley and I couldn't seem to find anyone nearly as good, until now.   The first thing I noticed about McClintock Animal Care Center is the separate entrance for dogs and cats. This definitely eliminates some stress of having to keep my dog on a short leash while waiting up front. The second thing I noticed was the friendly front desk staff. They greeted me and my dog as soon as we walked in and promptly came around the desk to pet my dog and offer her a treat. It was obvious everyone who worked there was an animal lover and enjoyed their job. The third thing I noticed was that the waiting room was very clean.  A vet assistant took my information in the exam room, which was spacious and clean, and let me know the vet would be there in a few minutes. Both the vet and the vet assistant were very friendly and made sure to explain all the procedures and the cost of everything. They showed me the cost of all the procedures I requested before they started anything.   Since this was our first time in, the vet took a few minutes to get to know my dog and gave her a couple treats before her shots. Then she gave her a treat after everything was done (this is something my old vet always used to do and I didn't see that at other vets here in the valley).   I would say the cost of everything was very comparable to other vets I have been to, and they gave me the 25% discount on the exam fee for mentioning Yelp.   If you have just moved to the valley, or are looking to switch vets, I highly recommend McClintock Animal Care Center!

After seeing this place advertised in a New Times email I convinced my coworker to check it out with me for lunch today. The article on the New Times website said to mention the email and you would get a lunch special including pita, fries, and a drink for 4.99. What a deal! However, when I ordered and asked for the special, the girl at the register didn't know what I was talking about. She was going to ask the owner if the special was valid but he wasn't around. So she gave me the special for 5.99 rather than 6.44. If you want to use the New Times special, be sure to print the email and bring it with you! The food was better than average but not great. The gyro meat was flavorful and moist but there weren't heaping portions of meat. The fries were good and had the right amount of seasoning but seemed like they had been sitting out for a while. My coworker had the halloumi pita and loved the goat cheese. She tried the shieftalia and said it was good but she's had better at other Greek restaurants in the area. I would definitely try this place again but next time I'll remember to print out the coupon!

When I walked in I was immediately confused because they share a space with Rosati's and the My Arepa counter is pretty inconspicuous. I waited at the counter to pick up my food until someone came up. I called in my order and it took 40 minutes from when I placed my order for me to get my food - this was late afternoon after lunch and they weren't busy. So if you want to carry out I'd advise to call far in advance.  I ordered the arepas sampler with a ground beef, black beans, gouda cheese, chorizo, and carne asada arepa. I wanted a couple of arepas with shredded beef but they were out of the shredded beef (boo!) so I tried the ground beef and gouda cheese instead. On the side I ordered black beans and rice. The rice didn't have any flavor...I don't know anything about Venezuelan food so maybe the rice is meant to be that way.  The black beans were aaah-mazing. They were the highlight of the entire meal. I found the carne asada to be a little dry and chewy but the avocado sauce on it was delicious. The ground beef (which I thought was going to be bland and boring) was actually very tasty. The ground beef was clearly seasoned and maybe mixed with tomato sauce?  I had a groupon which is why I ordered so much food at once but I had no idea how much food I was really getting. I do think the rice and beans were pricey for the size, but what I thought would be two meals turned into four meals. I am all about leftovers!  I would like to go back and try the shredded beef arepas and the many other menu items.

We stopped by here after a spring training game last Sunday for drinks and dinner. I loved the setup of the patio and inside bar, especially because there were plenty of tv's to catch Selection Sunday. The prices seemed a little high but it is in Scottsdale. I ordered the RnR burger. The bacon was thick and flavorful but the hamburger tasted and looked like it had been frozen.  As I was eating I thought the burger and fries at Zipps was better and less expensive. Although the drinks seemed expensive, they did include a double shot. Our waitress was friendly but seemed pre-occupied and had a hard time keeping our order straight. She ended up bringing us an extra iced tea and mixed drink the bar made, but seemed to disappear when we needed her. Even if the service were great I don't know if I'd make it a point to go back based on the food and price of the drinks.

It was love at first bite! I ordered the fried noodles with beef in the xo sauce. The sauce was spicy and savory. I don't like sweet and savory so it was the perfect sauce for me. There was a nice balance of noodles, beef, and vegetables and the portion size was very generous (only 7.95!). We ordered egg rolls for an appetizer and they were your standard egg rolls with pork. The only thing I could give constructive feedback on was that the egg rolls came out after the noodles. The service was friendly and attentive and it was so much fun to watch the noodles being made in the kitchen. I think this will be my new go to carry out restaurant when I am craving chinese food. I definitely want to try the soup next time.

My groupon was about to expire so I ordered take out today. I ordered the Spacoli's original cheesesteak with garlic fries and an 18 inch pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos. They told me it would be about 30 minutes when I placed my order but it ended up taking about 45 minutes so I waited for a bit in the restaurant. The service was great - they offered me a small glass for a drink while I waited for my food. The total ended up being around 50 cents because I was using a groupon. The person who rang me up (I'm guessing an owner) didn't charge me since the total was so small.  The cheesesteak was flavorful and cheesy, they did not skimp on the whiz. The roll was soft and fresh. The garlic fries were tasty but soggy so I would ask  for them extra crispy next time. The pizza was definitely worth ordering again. The crust was handtossed so thin but not too thin. The crust was soft and the sauce was savory. The 18 inch pizza was cut into 8 huge slices. All in all you get a lot of good quality food for your money.

After 6 years owning my house my garage door finally needed repair because one of the rollers had fallen off. I know the owner and immediately contacted A1 to set up an appointment. They offered to send someone the next day but I needed to wait until the day after so I could be home and they setup a window from 8am-10am. They were supposed to call in advance when the technician was on his way but I didn't hear from them. However, he showed up around 9am, right in the middle of the appointment window. Ed was friendly and thorough, checking the entire door, cables, etc and even replaced my burned out light bulbs. He told me the rollers have a lifetime warranty and showed me how to lubricate the rollers to ensure the warranty isn't voided.

My friends and I have been excited for a true sports bar to open up on Mill so we checked out Blondies on Friday during their soft opening. They were serving food and drinks so we ordered a round of drinks and took a look at the menu. I was happy to see a wide variety of food including boneless wings, pizzas, and sandwiches. The boneless wings were good and the medium wing sauce still had a kick to it and was slightly sweet. I can handle a lot of spice and the hot sauce was pretty spicy to me, also with a slightly sweet taste to it. The regular french fries were below average to me but the curly fries were fantastic. The beers are cheap - three dollars for domestics and four dollars for imports. They also have a mysterious asu brew on tap which is always two dollars (we were pretty sure it was bud light). Liquor is very expensive - nine dollars for a drink - so I recommend ordering beer. Since I am not a beer drinker I was disappointed when I got the bill and saw my drink was nine dollars.  The service was great and while the decor is minimal it is a huge step up from the library. There are plenty of tv's inside and my only other criticism is there aren't any tv's on the patio yet. I went back here on Sunday to watch some NFL games and had the same great service and pretty decent quality bar food.

This review is based on the ramen. I tried the chile ramen and was extremely disappointed. The broth was spicy but flat. It was lacking acidity or something, almost like they forgot an ingredient. I've eaten from the hot pot menu before and it was fantastic. I'm not sure why the ramen turned out so poorly. I'll be hesitant to go back for the ramen. On the other hand, the mango green boba tea was delicious.

I tried this place about a month ago and was blown away. The owners were very friendly and gave us soup to try for free and an extra piece of baklava for free. The chicken was so moist I immediately wondered if it was cooked all the way. It is incredible that chicken can be fully cooked and still so moist. The owner told us he has a secret process for cooking the chicken that keeps it so moist. The falafel seemed to taste a bit different than what I'm used to but it was still good. There wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like. I would eat here all the time if I lived closer.

I bought a groupon for this studio and went to classes several times a week for a month. All the staff were friendly and addressed me by name after just a couple sessions. Most of the classes I attended were beginning/intermediate and they were always willing to work with anyone regardless of their level. I'm not sure if there would be enough classes each week for someone at the advanced level to attend but it is a fantastic studio for those at the beginner/intermediate level.

I brought my dog here because the other place I used to take her to has continued to raise their prices. I used the yelp deal and also received a discount for boarding her for 5 days. It seems clean and well supervised. The only thing missing was customer service. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't nearly as friendly and knowledgeable as the other doggie day care I used to take her to. However, she came back tired, happy, and injury free so I'd probably take her back here.

Don't let the size of this place stop you from coming in. It is small and the grocery items and menu aren't extensive, but my sandwich and salad were delicious. The meat and cheese were sliced for my sandwich when I ordered. The owner Walter walked around talking to the tables while I was there. I'd love to come back and try the pasta.

I finally tried this place today and I'm glad I did. Being a KC native, I have found it difficult to find good bbq in the valley. When I'm craving bbq in the future, I'll be going back here. I'm looking forward to trying their burnt ends and french fries.   I ordered the two meat platter with brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and bbq beans. The bbq beans were more like the beans I'm used to (made with bbq sauce), not the cowboy beans you typically get in the valley. The mac n cheese seemed homemade, but it needed a bit of salt and pepper - I like pepper in my mac n cheese.  The brisket was deliciously smoky and had a perfect pink ring around the edge. It could have been more tender, but it was leaps and bounds better than the fatty, no flavor brisket I usually get out here.   The pulled pork was fantastic and it's not something I usually get. It was extremely moist, tender, and flavorful and there was no fat.   The presentation also reminded me of home with the two slices of white bread under the meat and pickles on the side. One of my favorite things about bbq is eating white bread soaked in sauce.   Unfortunately, the only thing I didn't like was the bbq sauce, but that is a personal preference. All three of their sauces are sweet and I do not like sweet bbq sauce. I would have given them five stars if I liked their bbq sauce.  I can't speak much to the service and ambiance because I ordered carry out. However, the hostess was very friendly/helpful and there was a nice bar with tv's.   If you are craving quality smoked meats, this is your place.

Fantastic little bread bakery in Chandler. I noticed their sign in a strip mall near my house and finally stopped in today. I sampled the Sriracha, lemon, and cinnamon bread. Since I don't like raisins I bought the cinnamon rather than the cinnamon raisin bread. The lemon bread was tangy and moist with a glaze on top. The Sriracha bread was savory with just a little bit of spice and I can imagine would be perfect for sandwiches.  If you want homemade bread without taking the time to make it yourself this is the perfect place to stop by!

After having lived in New Mexico I'm always trying to find good New Mexican food out here, and I was excited to try this place based on the reviews. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. I wasn't a fan of any of the trio of salsas, but salsas can be a very personal taste. The blue corn enchiladas with shredded beef, christmas style were extremely bland. I kept thinking if I ate more they would get better, but they got worse as I became more disappointed in the lack of flavor. The beef was moist but I couldn't seem to find a hint of flavor. I also expect green and red chile to have a kick to it and I didn't notice any spice. The atmosphere was great and they appear to have live music. The sangria margarita was delicious. I wouldn't come back for the food but it seems like a fun place for happy hour if you're in the neighborhood.

I honestly don't know how anyone can give less than a five star review. The sangria was strong and not too sweet. I ordered the empanada platter with the beans and cheese and pernil empanada. Somehow the beans and cheese in the empanada tasted even better than the side of beans. The pernil was moist and really flavorful, I was sad when I didn't have another one to eat. Since the restaurant is small I can see how busy this place could get but I came after the lunch rush and didn't have to wait for a table or my food.

Met my friend here on Sunday for breakfast/brunch and I have to say I'm disappointed I had not been here sooner! I had the french toast special with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. The potatoes were delicious, flavorful but not too salty with crispy kale. The scrambled eggs were rich and creamy and the bacon had a hint of sweetness. I don't usually order french toast but I had a craving for sweets. The toast was thick and the syrup was buttery and not too sweet. I can't wait to go back and try lunch and the bakery.

I'm not the biggest fan of Fox concept restaurants...I went in without high expectations and I left pleasantly surprised. I ordered three sides: spicy eggplant, cauliflower, and mac n cheese. All three were very flavorful and fresh. I would go back just for the mac n cheese. The price point is good too at 9 dollars for a healthy and filling lunch.

I was disappointed they were out of the bacon sauce. However, I very much enjoyed the burger. I like how you can add your own toppings. They were generous with the bacon and other toppings.  The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The onion rings were crisp and flavorful, so many times the batter is bland.

I grabbed lunch to go here today and I can't think of anything negative to say. The staff were friendly, the food was fresh, portions were generous and price was reasonable. The only reason I may not go here again is because Hummus Xpress is just down the street and seems to have a wider variety of authentic Mediterranean options.

Five stars for one of the few healthy, fast casual options in the valley. Their portions are generous and the veggies are truly fresh. I usually get the steak bowl with szechuan sauce because I like spicy. I tried the chop salad yesterday and the portion was so large I ended up saving half for the next day.

I can't say that I've ever had Puerto Rican food and this was better than I could have imagined! I ordered the ground beef pastelillo, tostones, and pernil with arroz con gandules. The portion sizes are extremely  generous. One pastelillo could probably be enough for lunch and the pernil is enough for at least two people.  Everything was flavorful and the pernil was tender and moist. The beans have green olives which gives a nice salty and briny flavor. The ground beef pastelillo was out of this world! I highly recommend ordering one, no matter what else you get. I ordered takeout and the man at the counter was very friendly confirming my order and offering condiments.

Drinks - 5 Service - 5 Food - 3  Went here on a Thursday night and we had the patio all to ourselves. I saw the reviews about the great drinks and sure enough we were lucky to have Tommy as our bartender! We didn't even need to look at a drink menu,  we told him the alcohol we wanted and he made a drink for us. The mango margarita and greyhound were my favorites. The food wasn't bad, but very average. The charcuterie board was fairly generous for the price but nothing out of the ordinary, two meats, two cheeses, and some walnuts and pecans. The steak satay were small and a little dry. I would recommend going here for drinks, and food it it's for happy hour snacks.

This restaurant was on my bookmark list and I finally had the chance to try it today while I was waiting for my car to be repaired. I ordered the beef Ala maxo based on Max's recommendation (I don't eat fish). I wasn't sure what to expect as I have never had cuisine from Ghana. The strips of beef green pepper, and carrots were in a hearty, savory gravy with white rice on the side and it was delicious. Everyone there was extremely friendly, chatting with me occasionally while I ate. I overheard the staff talking to a customer about ginger beer, which I love (and had no idea it was an African specialty). When I asked about it they brought me a complimentary glass - so much better than the canned stuff! I'll be back on a weekend to try the okra stew.

This is not your typical Chandler restaurant and bar. Craft cocktails, a solid wine list, and thoughtful food menu, along with a classic decor make you feel like you're in Chicago, New York, or San Francisco. The electro swing music really brings everything together. I think this is the first place in Chandler I would recommend traveling from any part of the valley to experience. And today is their grand opening! It can only get better from here.

Wow other reviewers were not kidding when they said the portions were huge. You can get at least two meals, maybe more, out of their meat dishes. I ordered hot and sour soup, dumplings in chili oil, and chicken with jalapeño for carry out. I didn't have to drive very far but everything was temperature hot when I ate it like I had been served in the restaurant. I probably ordered the most Americanized items on the menu but everything was delicious and good quality. The only potential negative was that the chicken and jalapeño seemed a bit salty after a while. This is yet another great new restaurant in Chandler and I'm sure I'll be back often.

Finally!  Another restaurant in Chandler worthy of being located anywhere in the valley. I went in for dinner last night and to my pleasant surprise there were already a few tables filled. I was seated immediately. It did take a couple minutes for my server to stop by but the service the rest of the night was impeccable. The owner even stopped by for a couple minutes towards the end of the meal. We ordered the focaccia (free with Yelp check in!) and it was a great starter. A little crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. The olive oil was very flavorful and good quality. I could have drank it right out of the cup. The house made sangria was also great, sweet but just the right amount of sweetness for my taste (I do tend to like drinks on the sweet side). The gusto bolognese hit the spot! I loved the tangy arugula on top and the ricotta spread on the side of the bowl. The veal ragu was meaty and the parpadelle was perfectly al dente. The meatballs deserve to be famous. For dessert, the affogato was a perfect size and I loved the presentation with the server pouring the espresso over the brownie and Gelato at the table. The tiramisu was creamy but I felt lacked flavor, it was more like just eating mascarpone...but maybe my palate was too overwhelmed with the delicious affogato. I will be back to try the salads, sandwiches, and pizza!

I went back for lunch and grabbed the chop salad to go along with another focaccia since it's free with check in :) The salad didn't have an overpowering flavor but I didn't think it was bland, I thought it was delicious. My only complaint was the lack of salami. When I first dug into the salad I thought they forgot it. I picked through and found five little slivers (think chiffonade) of salami.  If I'm ordering a chop salad I'm expecting a balance of meat cheese, and veggies. The cheese was great and much more of a generous portion. I would only order the chop salad again if the meat portion matched the cheese portion.

For my first time here I tried the fried chicken and a variety of sides. I wasn't blown away with the mac and cheese at first bite like I was hoping to be but the more I ate it the more I liked it. The greens were delicious, tender and salty with a great meaty flavor. They were my favorite out of everything. The fried chicken was pulled from the fryer after I entered the restaurant to grab my carry-out order. Don't get me wrong the fried chicken is good and flavorful! However it didn't quite bring me back to my mom's fried chicken. It could have been much more crispy. The red beans and rice were different than I've ever had. There was a hint of sweet to them, which I'm guessing is the island influence. The portions for everything were generous and one meal could serve two people. All in all I give this local restaurant four stars for quality food.
