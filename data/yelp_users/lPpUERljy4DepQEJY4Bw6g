One of my favorite lunch spots in the downtown/uptown part of Phoenix. It's the classic family-run Italian restaurant with some of the best pizza around.  Service is always friendly and prompt, which is no small feat at lunchtime, considering the place is typically packed. I think I've probably tried half of the menu, plus a number of the daily specials, and everything is consistently good. The New York style pizza (pick up, fold in half, go nuts) comes in large slices with generous amounts of toppings.   As for pasta, I can honestly say that I don't believe I've ever had an overcooked dish here, which is not something I can say about most Italian food restaurants. The ravioli is very good, as is the tortellini (when it's on special). I'm also partial to their salads, which are quite large. Both the chicken caesar and the tuna salad contain ample amounts of meat, which I prefer.  And if you want a great base for a sandwich, you can't get much better than their focaccia bread, which is soft and delicious.  The one thing that does rankle me about Pino's, however, is that they now have a $10 minimum purchase for credit card payment. I understand their reasonings for the move (credit card fees can rack up in a hurry for small businesses and take larger than expected bites out of profit margins), but as someone who rarely carries cash and doesn't always order a lot of food, it is a bit of a pain.  There also isn't much parking in front, but savvy patrons know to check the lot behind the restaurant and come in the back door.

Where to start? I remember eating at this chain 20 years ago, when I was a child. Now I know why my parents stopped taking us there.  I would wager none our food was made fresh, save perhaps for one of my family member's beef ribs -- which looked to be so overcooked, they passed "dry" sometime in the early afternoon. Everything tasted either canned or made from frozen. The chicken fried stake I ordered verged on inedible, and was clearly an overly deep-fried frozen steak. The mashed potatoes were awful and pasty, to the point I would swear the simply scooped the inside of a baked potato and put it on my plate. If there was a trace of cream or butter in them, I couldn't detect it. The baked beans were clearly reheated out of a can, as were the green beans. For dessert, the apple pie was runnier than the soup that started the meal -- a beef barley soup that looked of refuse.   To top it off, the service was awful, with our waitress consistently forgetting requests and appearing about as often as my mother-in-law's urge to keep her nose in her own damn business.   I can only imagine that this chain is still open because of the nostalgia. Stay away if you actually want to enjoy your meal. If all you want is a floor with sawdust, food that takes no more than a deep-fryer and a microwave to prepare and inattentive service, this is your dream restaurant.

I generally dislike seafood, but I fell in love with Caribbean food during my honeymoon in the Bahamas. The flavors were so wonderful and the quality and freshness of the ingredients so much different than I had grown up with, that it truly changed my perspective. I still may not clamor for seafood (and still greatly prefer milder fish to the more robust and fishier options), but I appreciate fresh seafood when I can get it.  Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered not only fantastic fresh seafood in the middle of downtown, but also a restaurant that brought the flavors of my honeymoon rushing back. Breadfruit pleased from the get-go when my wife and I ate there recently.   One of the seafoods I like least is scallops, a fact I am coming to accept is because they are typically frozen and overcooked to a displeasing rubbery texture. I have only ever eaten scallops at one restaurant (Moto) that were good. Still, my wife loves scallops and I love jerk flavors, so we ordered the Appleton Rum Sea Scallops, which are covered in a jerk rub. Suffice to say, I now have eaten two scallop dishes I love. The jerk seasoning was wonderfully spicy and the scallops were perfectly seared and cooked until they were just translucent in the center. They were soft enough to cut with a fork and practically melted in your mouth.  For dinner, I had the Escovitch Fish, which was Atlantic red snapper on the day we dined. Red snapper is a fish I discovered in the Bahamas, and this dish reminded me how good it can be. The filet was cooked perfectly and the escovitch sauce - essentially a spicy vinegar mixture - was quite good, as were the pickled vegetables that accompanied it.   After much deliberation, my wife chose the Brown Stew Chicken which, while complexly flavored, was quite dry and overcooked, which was a shame. Her dish was the one blemish on our meal, but the rest of the food was so good (and the untried items on the menu so appetizing) that we will definitely return.  Also, a note: The portions are small, but this is an upscale Caribbean restaurant, where the focus is much more on quality over quantity.

This pub's owners certainly had some cojones opening shop just down the road from Mill Avenue mainstay Rula Bula -- and it likely won't be long before they're packing up the Jameson barrels and Irish charm and locking the door for the final time, because Robbie Fox's doesn't hold a candle to its nearby competition. It's never a good sign when a restaurant advertises its daily special as swordfish on the sign out front, but the waitress tells you the special is catfish. That's a clear sign of a dining establishment that doesn't have its act together.  First, the good: A strong variety of Irish whiskeys, Scotch whiskeys and Irish/UK beers. Jameson is sold for a very reasonable $5 a glass (and a ridiculously good $2 during happy hour) and the bar portion of the restaurant seems like a great hangout. The restaurant's proximity to Churchill's Cigars and a spacious patio makes for a nice way to relaxing with a Scotch in one hand and a cigar in the other.  However, there is much more (or less, I suppose) to this place than just the bar. The ambiance is nice, though done much better at other local pubs, including Lis Doon Varna in Peoria.   The food, however, is quite disappointing. While I initially gave the proprietors credit for correctly calling one of their menu items "cottage pie," as it was made of ground beef (and shepherd's pie requires ground lamb), upon tasting the dish, it should have its name changed to "exceptionally bland gravy with undercooked veggies and flavorless ground beef, covered in confusingly bland whipped potatoes." Yikes. I have no idea how such a rustic, simple, savory dish can turn out so nearly inedible because of a lack of flavor.   All of the food was not bad. The fish and chips were quite good -- the fish was perfectly fried, seasoned properly and delicious, though I do wish it had been a traditional piece of batter-fried fish, not an entire fish filet. The shape and size of the filet required a knife and fork to eat, which unfortunately means you can't easily dunk the fish into the divinely snappy tartar sauce.   But just when you think they are doing something right, Robbie Fox's once again returns to mediocrity (at best). The mushy peas? They could be tasty, if they were even slightly salted. Outside of chips at a Mexican food restaurant, I shouldn't have to salt my food. The same goes for the shoestring fries that accompanied the fish.  The final straw for me was the service. We dined at about 5:30 on a Saturday. The restaurant was not busy, and there were at least three servers taking care of the dining area, but we rarely saw our waitress.

I went to one of the soft-opening events for Arrogant Butcher and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service was a bit hit-and-miss, but that can be forgiven, considering the restaurant hadn't opened to the public and was still ironing out the bugs.  Our party of four shared the mussels and rock shrimp for appetizers. While the shrimp were good (a bit over-fried for my taste, but the r√©moulade was quite tasty), the mussels were outstanding. The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and the shellfish was cooked perfectly. My only gripe is with the pomme frites included in the bowl -- were they left out, I wouldn't miss them one iota.   For dinner, our table ordered the salmon, the crab-stuffed chicken and the fish & chips, while I dined on the bone-in rib eye. The dry-aged steak was cooked to perfection and served with a delightfully flavorful jus, though there was a large portion of fat and gristle in the steak. The fish portion of my wife's dish was wonderful, while the chips were nothing more than the fries included with the mussels. The cod was cooked to perfection, and was battered in a spicy beer batter that perfectly complimented the very dilly from-scratch tartar sauce. My dining companions raved about the other dishes.  For dessert, we shared the peanut butter cup, which is composed of a warm peanut butter mousse topped with chocolate gelato. It was decadent and quickly devoured by the four of us.  My biggest gripe comes not about the food, but about the service at the bar, where some in my party waited more than 10 minutes prior to being seated for requests as simple as a martini or a draft beer. I also would have liked to see a larger scotch and whiskey selection, but Fox Concepts does score points for having a quite large selection of Arizona beers, both on tap and in bottles.   I will absolutely return.
