After tasting other well-acclaimed pastrami that don't measure up to Zoozacrackers, I realized how much I like the Zoozabuger...even though it's a pricey burger; it's well worth the price for how tasty the pastrami is...=D

Freddy's is my all-time favorite burger chain. I like it even better than In-N-Out. I love the shoestring fries. I love their burger patty and how thin they are. I think this is what McDonald's tasted like before they went big, then again, I wouldn't know since I wasn't around back then. I wish they would have a Freddy's near where I live.

The stove was broken in our room. We had two rooms reserved, but the hotel couldn't even put us in the same suite unit. The front desk was slow and didn't know how to break a large bill. I guess I just expected a little more from the Trump Hotel but was let down. There were some positive points about this place such as the smoke-free environment and the TV on the bathroom mirror. But I don't know if I would stay here again if I come back to Vegas.

The steak here is awful for a steakhouse. Granted I came here because it was part of a package we got and it was a prix fixe for five-top but it was still awful. For a place called "Tender", their medium filet mignon was anything but tender.  I felt like was eating rubber. The salad was nothing special and the dessert flourless chocolate cake was not good at all.

I enjoyed how this place does different type of brewing methods. Although I thought the girl work the cash register was not very knowledgeable in the different brewing methods. She couldn't seem to be bothered to explain them or how the beans go together. Perhaps it's because this place is in the airport so there is no need to worry about repeated guest. The coffee itself was alright. The brewing method selection just seemed like a fad. But props to the place for coming up with ways to distinguish itself from the average coffee places.
