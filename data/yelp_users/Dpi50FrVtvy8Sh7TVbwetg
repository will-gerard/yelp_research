Awesome BBQ restaurant!  I have been to Honey Bears many times and I will definitely be back. The BBQ is great and the service is good too. I recommend stopping by on a Friday for the fresh fried catfish. So good! You know the are making some crazy good food because the lines at there catering events are never ending!   Pros - Great fresh BBQ - Good service - Original tasting  Cons - Wait times

Will never return the this establishment again!  I have been coming to this AJ's for a couple years but unfortunately I will not be returning. When I first started shopping here it was a pleasant experience but over time the customer service got worse. I am not sure if this was due to new employees or management. Although, I must blame management because the attitudes and treatment that I received usually travels from the top down. I had the most issues with a couple employees that work in the deli area. They were both always rude, short, and unpleasant. Every time I said hello to one of the women she NEVER responded. Not so much as a head nod to acknowledge my presence. I brought this to the attention of a cashier and she told me that she would speak to the manager about the service. I continued to go to AJ's but nothing changed and I received bad service over and over again. The last straw for me happened last week. I went to the deli area to get breakfast. I greeted one of the deli workers and she AGAIN said nothing. I was sure that this was on purpose and not her just having a bad day because it had happened so many times before. I asked her why she never responds and seems to have bad customer service. She dismissed me and said "actually, I was just about to ask you how you day was going" I thought this was amusing considering she just neglected to respond to my greeting... I told her that she had done this on a number of occasions and it was quite frankly rude and disappointing. She then jumps to want me to get my manager... Like she could care less about fixing the situation for the customer, apologizing, or making things right.   Super disappointed with my treatment at the AJ's. Will stay away from here from now on and I would definitely NOT recommend anyone else to shop here. A number of employees could care less about you, your hard earned money, or treating with respect and dignity. Management obviously doesn't follow up with complaints properly as well.

Stopped by Pane Bianco with my girlfriend yesterday on our way to the park. We both got the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. It was delicious. The service was great and outside seating was dog friendly. I definitely want to check this place out again to see what else is on their menu!  Pros -Good food -Fresh bread -Nice outside seating  Cons -little pricey

This place is pretty legit!  Have been here 3 or 4 times and always have a good experience. I believe this is a family run place, at least it has that feel. The customer service is very good and the sandwiches are even better! I never knew a vegetarian sandwich could be appetizing but theirs definitely was. My father typically gets a roast beef that looks delish. I would recommend this place to any sandwich lover.   Pros -Good prices -Little Tabasco -Lots of options -Made fresh -Good potion  Cons -Weird seating

Great customer service at Chandler Harley!  Had a very informative conversation about a Harley 883 motorcycle that I am interested in. My sales associate, Mike Montemorra, really knows his stuff. I let him know that I was going to wait a while until purchasing and this was not a problem. He informed me about different payment options, upgrades, and even bike riding classes. When I get a Harley it will be from this location.

Very disappointing experience...  Have been to Ra Sushi a number of times over the years and have had an overall positive view of the restaurant as a whole. Although, after my recent visit to this particular Ra Sushi location I am entirely done with them.   Was in the area and saw the restaurant from the street and decided to drop in. I was by myself so decided to sit at the bar. First, it took a while for me to be greeted... From the get go the bartender (Jennifer) wasn't warm, friendly, nor accommodating. The initial interaction with the bartender would hold true for my entire experience.   After being greeted I put in my drink order. The drink did not take long and was actually made very well. The issue was the horrendous customer service. I was three sips into my drink and the bartender (JENNIFER) brought me my tab.... Mind you, this was around 8:00 PM on a weekday... no close coming around the corner nor did I indicate I was there for just one quick drink. This coupled with the fact that she had an overall rude attitude towards me was upsetting. No customer ever wants to feel rushed.   While at the bar I was never checked up on one time. No, "how's the drink..." "Here is your bill. No rush sir." "Would you like anything else?" "Thanks for coming in" ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I was also never asked if I wanted a menu. I received dirty looks to boot???   I typically like to stay on topic and never reference other reviews as a 3rd party... Although, one needs only read through this restaurants review to see they have a major issue with service that they have obviously yet to properly address.   I will not be spending my hard earner money with this business again. If you value good customer service and professionalism I recommend you stay away from Ra Sushi.   Disappointed.

Horrible Safeway! I would recommend that no one goes to this Safeway location unless you absolutely have to.   Honestly I don't even know where to start with these people Lol. I have had horrible experience personally and people have told me of even worse things. I will start with my own experiences. In short I was followed around the entire store by the manager... I even asked her what she was doing and she would not reply. It was completely out of left filed because I'm a 25 year old good look sharp dressed dude just looking for grocerys and a manager of the store is literally following my every step. I thought I was being punked... But I clearly wasn't. Interesting enough, I later find out from a Safeway employee that this lady is indeed the store manager and has some crazy Nazi type obsession with monitoring any and all minorities that enter the store. This woman has also been said to say extremely prejudice things in front of other employees.   This Safeway isn't worth your time or money! Trust me...

Have been going to this gym for a couple of months now. Everything seems to be great so far. The staff is mostly young ASU students so don't expect them to be too friendly or helpful. Other than that, the gym has a lot of great new equipment. I am a calisthenic athlete and I find it easy to switch between weights and body weight exercises in this gym. The people who go to the gym are younger but very respectful and nice.

Have been going to the YMCA since I was a child and will not be going back. Turns out having young, immature, and disrespectful staff is too much to overlook. Had an extremely rude interaction with a young girl who worked behind the desk. I do not recommend you spending money on a membership at this location if you are over 23 years old. Place is for kids who don't take working out seriously

Do not be fooled by the exterior of this place! It's worth checking out.  I live in the area and have frequented The Prime Chinese Restaurant many times. The place is great for lunch and dinner. The serving sized are very large. And the meals are delicious. I recommend the vegetable egg foo young. The service here is very good. You will most likely be greeted by an older Asian woman. She owns the place and is so friendly. I work in marketing and SEO so I offered to help them with getting some more exposure but she seemed doubtful that they would be in business come the new year.   Please check this local business out! They treat their customers with the utmost appreciation and respect. It would be sad to see a business that has been there for 21 YEARS go out of business.   Pros:  - great food - large servings - awesome service - decent wait times - quiet atmosphere  Cons - not exactly cheap - needs better decorating touch

I'm a fan of Zipps but the staff at this location are simply dense. I was served the most disgusting salad once there. I simply told the waitress I didn't want it but I had no problem paying for it. The manager comes out and proceeds to ask me what my issue with the salad was. I said to him that it's not a big deal and I should have known better than to get a salad at Zipp's. He still wanted to know what was wrong with the salad. I told him it looked like a 4 year old made it and he could bring the chef out if he would like and I could show him how to make a salad... I left shortly after.

I have been coming here for years!  If you are into breakfast you will definitely enjoy Harlow's Cafe. Great food and good portion sizes. The place can get pretty busy on the weekends so be prepared for a little bit of a wait time. After you are seated the get order quickly and food is prepared just as fast. I recommend the Eggs Benedict, sooo good.   Pros - Great food - Decent prices - Lots of seating (including bar seating) - Old diner ambiance  Cons - Some waitresses kind of suck  - wait times on weekends

Tott's is awesome!  I remember going to Tott's back when it first opened on McClintock and Guadalupe years ago. I ate there on their second day of being opened and I have loved the place ever since. They had to move locations due in part to a Pei Wei opening up literally 100 yards away in the same shopping center. Besides location, nothing has changed with this wonderful place.   The food is really great. I would say Tott's food is like Pei Wei's except it tastes better, they have larger serving sizes, and there is a lot more choices on the menu ;) The service at this place is excellent. If you appreciate a business where they make an effort to get to know you and remember your name you will love Tott's.   Pros: - Awesome service - short wait times - great food - great selection - large servings - very competitive prices  Cons - not much seating

Delux is the shitz!  Great service, diverse menu, tasty food, and kitchen that stays open till 2:00 am! Now that's what I call competitive advantage. If you like burgers get the Delux burger! You can't go wrong. I am mostly veggie so I enjoy the basket of mixed fries (that comes in a little shopping cart I always want to steal) or the veggie panini.   Their banana split is epic!   Pros -kitchen open late -good food -owner is nice -great service -awesome deserts -fast service  Cons -small outside seating

After shredding downtown with the little lady we decided to check out this quaint little restaurant. First, their is a lot of outside seating. The ambiance outside is very nice as well. The inside is smaller but nicely decorated. This is a great place for dates or romantic one-on-ones. Our meals were great. We had the calamari, a pizza, and a wood fired sandwich.   Pros - great ambiance - good food - decent prices  Cons  - limited inside seating - just okay service - parked in the back. Trash bin was overflowing and smell turned us off.

Good breakfast place!  Went here with my parents this weekend for breakfast. I must say everything was great. We were seated promptly, order was taken in a timely manner, and food came out fast and delicious. I recommend getting the veggie egg white omelette.

Definitely good Thai food!   Don't live in Tempe anymore but my folks do. Decided to try this place out and introduce my girlfriend to my parents here. We all had a very pleasant experience. The service was ehhh. But (with all due respect) Asians generally have 'whatever' service anyways. Maybe it's a cultural thing. Anyways, the food was great, wait wasn't long, and fresh atmosphere. They also do some pretty creative things with their presentation. To top it off my parent loved my girlfriend! ;)   Pros -Great food -Endless selection -Short wait times -Cool looking place -reasonable prices  Cons -average servers who aren't too welcoming -inside needs more creative depth

My family has been shopping at this Albertsons for many years. Unfortunately, this morning my parents had a very bad customer service experience with a disheveled looking manager. This stems from a simple question/request that was directed towards the manager. The manager responded in a very rude and annoyed manner for no apparent reason. This is very unfortunate because my folks actually just had a decent experience with the butcher in the meat department. I have personally noticed that their customer experience has gone down hill over the years. My families dollars will not be spent at this Ablertsons again. I will also recommend others in the community to go elsewhere. It's to bad, what I have read about the Albertons organization and mission is not being reflected by their management. The culture has taken some big hits over the years...

Well I grew up in Tempe and always went to the vine! For starters, they have horrible customer service. You will rarely leave there feeling like the servers, hostess, or bartender went out of their way to make your experience better. You'll notice that the employees are all very fairly young... maybe this has something to do with the poor customer service? They take short cuts all the time! Especially when they are busy. Be careful on your To-go orders! If you get wings they will most likely be dished out to you cold. This has happened to me a few times when I dined in as well.   The Vine just has a 'whatever' feel to me. Honestly It's like going to Applebees but with worst service and less selection.   Pros: Decent bar food, normal service times, lots of TV's for sports viewing  Cons: Bad service, Rude staff, the kitchen let's cold food go out, cutting corners, horrible salads

Pros -great food -quick service -good service -valet parking -atmosphere  Cons -occasional long wait times -some drunk guy hassled me when I was peeing last time I went there. He kept banging on the door for me to finish... Almost had to Bruce Lee him

This place is how you want to start your mornings!   I love Dutch Bros. Great coffee and extremely fast service. But the best thing about Dutch Bros has got to be the customer service.

Pros: - awesome customer service! - good coffee with great selections - very good price - fast service  Cons - small outside seating area

Sorry but Lo-Lo's is highly overrated.   I don't know where to even begin with Lo-Lo's... I guess I will start by saying I will never be back!   The food is OVERRATED. Anyone who can actually cook will tell you that their fried chicken isn't even close to die for. It's just average fried chicken. Their collard greens are garbage as well. The greens from Honeybears aren't even that good but those definitely trump Lo-Lo's. The Mac and Cheese sucks! I know I am not the only one who thinks that too. Serving sizes are not generous at all. And the price is way too expensive.   The service is about as average as it gets. Maybe this is due to the fact that the servers are always so busy but most act like the could give two shits about their tip. The WAIT is horrendous. It's always at minimum a 35 minute wait for my party. Not to mention if anyone shows up who is consider a "somebody" they will usher them past everyone right to their table.  Anyways, I hate to hate but the main reason that this place is so successful is because the have entered into a niche market in the valley. It's not because of their food, service, or management.   Pros -lots of seating -great drinks  Cons -Service -Food -Wait times -atmosphere -Too expensive -overall unfriendly staff

Disappointment...   They have horrible customer service. Disappointing to see local business just not give two cents about treating customers the right way. The are not helpful, prompt, courteous, pleasant, or accommodating.   If you are willing to basically sacrifice self respect for cheap decent food... sure I guess.   Just ridiculous.

Place is good!   Have been here about 3 times and it has always pleasing. Drove by the place for quite some time when I was on the way to Postino. It's definitely attractive from the outside so that made me check it out. Service is decent here and the food is great. Although, a few of their signature dishes need a couple tweaks. The spicy shrimp pasta first hits your pallet with a bang but you are soon left with a 'nothing' taste. I would attribute it to lack of seasoning. The spinach tortelloni is great but they put WAY too much butter. A seasoned chef would send it back. The theme of the restaurant (country) doesn't match the type of food they serve although it somehow works...  Pros -nice atmosphere -cool design -decent service -great food  Cons -some off tasting food -community seating

Really enjoyed Angels Trumpet Ale House.   Great assortment of delicious beer. The food is really good as well. I recommend the fish tacos... they were surprisingly good. The only reason I am not 5 stars on these guys is some sub par service from a server and a bartender.   The 'Beer to go' option is epic. You can pick your favorite beer from their tap and take it to go in a sealed house beer can. Pretty cool  Highly recommend this place!

This place is great.   Zooks is just a stones throw away from where I live. My girlfriend recommended to me so I thought I'd check it out. Zooks is kinda like a Cornish Pasty co. on the go and less hearty. Although, I believe Zooks food is completely fresh. I will most likely be back and would recommend this place to others. For breakfast the number 11. sandwich is great.  Pros:  -great service -short wait times -awesome tasting food -great prices  Cons: -I feel like there are random close times on the weekends -not much parking

Happy with my experience.   Came here recently for breakfast with my girlfriend. We arrived and were informed the wait would be 45 mins to an hour. Luckily we only waited for around 30 minutes.   We ordered the daily special which was steak and eggs...also got some eggs, toast, and hash browns. Unfortunately, we ended up waiting nearly 40 mins for our food which was a tad bit disappointing because I heard good things about this place and service.   Food eventually came out and was delicious... What amended the situation for me was managements handling of the everything. Without us even complaining they paid for our meal and apologized for the wait.   Shout out to management for the professionalism. We will be back.

Disappointed with sub par service.  Came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night. Was greeted promptly and sat inside. Server had a careless serving performance. Ordered something on menu and was quickly told they were all out. Totally understandable, so we ordered something else. Drinks and food took too long considering there were only 5 couples inside and a half stocked bar. Some of our food never came out and they still put it on our bill. Made them aware and they did take it off. Server had the whole I could care less what happens to my tip attitude (of course I made her work there so it's my fault)   Not really disappointing because my girlfriend likes this place and I don't. Although, the upside of living downtown is lots of options for her!

Great breakfast joint!   Have been to Snooze a couple times with the girlfriend. I love how creative they are with the menu and how generous the portion sizes are.

They have good baguettes and cheeses. Pre-made food is not so good and customer service is lacking. Maybe it's an "oh you're not a regular" attitude? But then again, how does one become a regular...  Pros -Fresh bread -Good cheeses & spreads  Cons -Not much selection -Pre made food is so-so

I am not a fast food guy at all. But on the rare occasion where I feel like hitting a drive through it's going to be Chick-fil-A (mandela?)   This organization has established a great culture or respect, courtesy, professionalism, and team work. The employees are so nice. It's a stark contrast from the Taco Bells and McDonalds.   Great work! I would rather someone stand up for their faith and have exemplary service... than be down for everything and try to fight me through the drive through window.

The Vig is still pretty cool.   I usually go to The Vig on 40th street but I was excited to hear that The Vig had opened much closer to my home.   I rode bikes there with my girlfriend a couple days ago. Our experience was pretty good. I would say the difference between this Vig and the 40th street location is the demographic. There is definitely a younger and more hip vibe at this location. The service is FAR better at this location as well.   Pros - great food - decent prices - great customer service - cool atmosphere and vibe  Cons - I didn't care for the hostess (acted like a square)

Went here with my girlfriend last night and had a good experience. Hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly. The number one thing that stood out to me was the ambiance in the place. Really cool looking decorative design in this restaurant. The vaulted ceilings above the bar really pop.  Our drink orders were taken in only a few minutes and our food orders were taken shortly after. We ordered a combination of different tacos. The fish, veggies, and shrimp tacos are delicious. Overall, this place does a good job!   Pros:   -Great food -Good service -Reasonable prices  -Awesome ambiance  Cons -I believe I left my card there and still waiting to hear back

Had three carni tacos. They were very good. For the price it doesn't get much better. They did a good job on the menu design as well.

Recently I have been frequenting this Dutch Bros. I've got to say the first couple times I came here it was a bit dead... Although, the last few times I came by were great! Laura brings life to this stand!   Keep it up guys.

Enjoyed the meal I had here the other night! I recommend the tofu curry dish and the calamari tempura.

I have to say I am very disappointed.  I am a long time customer of Sushi Station in the valley. The food and service has always been just great. However, I do not appreciate the way I was treated at Sushi Stations newest location on camelback.   I dropped into Sushi Station on camelback with my significant the other night. The place was pretty busy but we were attended to and seated promptly. Our server was a very nice young woman. About 7 minutes went by and my girlfriend and I had yet to get sushi off the belt that we wanted. It was just too busy and our central position enabled others to get the more popular sushi options first. This is understandable.. But we were having a craving for #delux.... So, we decided to get up and leave. Which last time I checked is not illegal. We had nothing but waters and no pending orders. What followed next is why I am posting this.  I heard a comment coming from behind me. I turn around and it was one of the sushi chefs. He then obnoxiously says 'thank you' like a freaking valley girl in front of a full house of people. I kept walking and did not entertain the rudeness and unprofessionalism.   I noticed the attitude and don't tolerate stuff like this from children with a sushi knife...  I won't come back until I get an apology from that chef. Pity because you guys are right down the street from us. We had been to this location a total of 6 times already.   Just dumb.   **still waiting on apology**

Had a pleasant experience at Mexx 32!  My girlfriend and myself came here the night after the grand opening. First, they have a great ambiance. Props to the person who was in charge of decor and design of this restaurant.  I went with the three tacos. Very delicious! I decided not to have any alcohol tonight but they had plenty of options.   I would recommend to encourage the serving staff to have a little more energy! This place is brand new... Make menu recommendations.. Ask how we heard about you... Talk about specials.. This was the only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars.

Took me back to Italy!   Just got a home on Roosevelt and found this little pizza spot during a night time walk. Decided to drop in and so happy I did. They did a wonderful job with the decor and even better job with the food. The pizza is classic Italian style and tastes great. Even cooked in a wood fire oven. I highly recommend this restaurant

Extremely disappointed with Forno. Your food is great, authentic, and reasonably priced. Although, after tonight I will never be back. My beautiful girlfriend and myself sat at the bar and were not acknowledged or waited on in the slightest. Non of my family will be coming here either. I will get working on my co-workers next.   You made a choice to serve us or blow us off.. Bad choice Roberto. Not cool

All around great experiences here.   Have been to Southern Rail a number of times. I have had nothing but great experiences here so far. I frequent the bar and the bartenders are always pleasant with me. The food at this place is excellent. I have always loved southern style food and their twist on Southern is very worth while.   I would recommend this place to anyone who values good service, great tasting food, accommodating staff, and a fresh friendly environment.
