I asked for a fill with regular polish. Assuming it was gonna be no more than 20 (cause according to their price list - fills are 15+), the guy that did my nails ended up filing my nails crooked and said it was my fingers... I have been getting acrylics for awhile.. I'm well aware of how my fingers look with PERFECT filed nails.   He even charged me to take off the polish I had prior when I came into the salon. That should be part of the process to get a fill... He ended up charging me $30..... while my friend got a fill with gel polish for $30... I could've gotten a full set for cheaper else where.   Not impressed. I do not recommend.

Known Q and Tai for a few years now! I absolutely love them!   I always get an acrylic full set and fill ins and they always do a perfect job. My nails always last about 3 weeks in between fills. They make sure they are super strong and they take their time doing your nails to make them perfect. I always ask to have a specific shape and it's not too round and not too pointy like stilettos. It's basically an almond shape and they always make it PERFECT.   Everyone is super nice and welcoming!   Prices are pricey but SOOOO worth it. My previous salon had cheaper prices but they were horrible and I had to always get something fixed. You definitely get what you pay for at Nails By Males!   Would recommend to absolutely anyone! :)
