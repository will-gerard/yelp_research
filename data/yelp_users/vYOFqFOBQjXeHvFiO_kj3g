R&S mattress has some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. My family has been buying mattresses from R&S since I was a kid and we have never had a bad experience. My parents have always recommend them to anyone looking for a mattress, and now I really understand why.   Recently my mattress started sagging a bit where I sleep and it was starting to really bother my back. I was ready to buy a new mattress but was sad because I knew I wouldn't be able to get one as nice as I had. My sister in law recommended calling R&S and explaining the situation to them and seeing what they thought. I called and spoke to Carlos, who was so amazing and so willing to help! He said they would send someone to check out the mattress and go from there. Justin arrived at my house a couple days later to look at the mattress and take a few pictures. Within another day or so I got a call from Carlos telling me they were going to pick up my mattress and either fix it or replace it. They picked it up on Monday and by Wednesday I had my mattress back and it was like new! I've had some of the best nights of sleep after a long time!  Thank you so much Carlos and Justin!! I will definitely come back anytime I need a new mattress and will be recommending you guys to everyone I know!!

Really disappointed with this place. This was my first time here and they did my entire pedicure (I always get my nails done so that I can have a cute design) then told me they could only do a flower on my toe. When I asked them what else they could do or to suggest something the woman was very rude and practically yelled at me about the fact that they don't do designs. I'm sorry but I have NEVER a been to a nail place that can't do a design on my toe! And on top of not being able to do it they made me so uncomfortable I left without even letting my nails dry. I will never be going back here for sure.

Hansa is the only person I trust with my eyebrows!! She is amazing! Threading is really an art and Hansa is the best!! If you've never tried threading for your eyebrows, try it now and you'll never go back to anything else!
