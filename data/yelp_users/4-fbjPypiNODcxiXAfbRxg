My favorite place to get a steak. It's always great. If you haven't tried their honey cinnamon rolls, you should.

The place was a little hard to find my first time. You really can't see it until you're passing it or you turn directly onto the street. On a higher note, the staff is very friendly and not "in your face" like most other Wells Fargos I've visited. They are extremely nice and aren't crazy busy like most other Wells Fargos(probably because people can't find it. Haha)

Pho is amazing especially for $4.50! You can additional things to your pho ranging from about 50Â¢ to $2. Pho always comes out fast, hot, flavorful, and fresh. The staff is extremely nice and I go there so often they know my boyfriend and I now.   Thai tea is AMAZING here, best I've had for a while. The boba is perfect too. Its not too hard or soft and doesn't add strange flavor to the milk tea. (You know what i mean if you've ever experienced this)However, I'm very disappointed I. All the other milk teas. They taste like sugary milk with very very little taste of the flavor you picked. This is bumming because I love taro milk tea and I absolutely hate it here.

I came in on a cloudy day to get my car cleaned, strange I know. But I haven't had my car cleaned in a long time and started to hear the dust in my breaks! Poor car.   I got my headlights buffed because they were very cloudy and just a quick rinse and rub down of the exterior car. The guys are very nice as well as efficient.   The customers that were also hear on a cloudy day happened to be people with really NICE cars. Mustangs and antiques. It says a lot for the people that care about their cars to all come to this car wash.  I would come back to have my car cleaned again. Maybe a detail next time!

The place is like subway/chipotle in the idea that you look over some glass and say what you want in your meal. They do have a variety of food to put in your meal which I give them props. However, I feel like I could buy a jar of sauce and cool noodles at home and they would be the same quality(I really am not that great of a cook). There noodles and/or sauce have a taste of plastic.  I would give them two stars mostly for food taste but the two experiences I had there, I don't plan on returning. They were extremely slow, even when I was the only person there.   Also, this happen to my co-worker, who is to nice to write a poor review. The manager there(I'm pretty sure she was the owner) decided that it was okay to insult the company that we work because she took some feedback about the experience we had as customers personally.  I don't know if they happen to be having bad days on those visits but regardless it wasn't a good experience.

Little more than 20 dollars for an adult. You can get a season pass for about 45. If you have a student ID they'll give you a small discount. There's a 3D movie, the butterfly exhibit, small aquarium, live give display(protected by glass) and a small pool to tough sting rays.   Before the big butterfly area, you arrive earlier in the day you can see some butterflies coming out of their cocoon!!!!

This was my second spin class ever. I recommend wearing a sleeveless shirt and something you're ready to sweat a lot in. It's great workout! That being said, it's nice that even though they encourage you to push yourself, they are very laid back. You don't have to feel like you have to keep up with them every moment. Everyone is unique and there for their own reasons!!! Bring a water bottle and your own towel(they have towels but yours is probably softer and smells just the way you like it).
