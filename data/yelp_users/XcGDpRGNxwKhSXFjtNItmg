I went to Christos as my 2nd Restaurant Week stop. I sat at the bar and it was a bit crowded there, but with lots of good energy people.  When I mentioned I would be skipping dessert, they were happy to sub a bruschetta for me! And I expected one, but they gave me four! And the goat cheese that came with it was fabulous.  The meal also came with a glass of wine, but as a non-wine drinker I passed on that.  After that, my real appetizer came out. Eggplant with a romesco sauce, shrimp scampi and a stuffed mushroom. A perfect portion and really delicious.  I finished with a chicken marsala roulade. This was just ok. The marsala flavor was a little too light, and the filling in the roulade was a bit stringy and didn't really boost the flavor like I expected it to.  I would definitely recommend it but I would try a different main course item.

Vincent's was my third restaurant week stop for Spring 2014, and is a five star but my restaurant week visit was a bit of a bummer.  Their food is fantastic. Their service is fantastic. It is an expensive restaurant, with the entrees in the mid thirties each, but worth every penny. I hate spending a lot of money and leaving a place underwhelmed, but I'll happily spend it at a place like this!  On the down side, this is the only restaurant this week, so far, that when I told them I wouldn't be eating dessert, they didn't sub out something else. I forgive them a bit considering of all the places, they are taking the biggest hit in terms of average revenue per table during restaurant week, but let me compare this to two years ago...  Two years ago a fourth guest spontaneously joined my table of three. Then she said she wasn't eating, she just wanted to hang out... I was a bit embarrassed by this, but said nothing. Then she started to eat off of everyone's plates! During restaurant week, that's completely unacceptable, and they could have been quite justified in charging us a plate sharing fee (which this year is $20).  Instead, Vincent's showed their incredible finesse and taste. They brought her an empty plate to make her food stealing easier! Then, at dessert time, they didn't ask what we wanted, they just bought one of each of the four available desserts! They said, "well there were four of you, so we just thought you would like one of each." Even though she didn't pay a dime. This was a deeply classy way to say we see what you are doing but will not stoop to your level...  I left a large tip (about 33%), and have told countless people about how Vincent's is the number one date place on my list for great food and service above and beyond any I've ever seen.  So this year (my sixth time going, three during restaurant week, three regular visits), it was really disappointing that they didn't even try to be creative with me. And no, it was not busy when we were there. I almost feel like the waitress didn't even ask or something and made the call herself.  I bet a manager would have come to explain if they had made that call. The difference between two years ago was a real disappointment.  But what I did eat was of course fantastic. The lobster roll was perfect on a slightly sweet roll, the ravioli was delicious and delicate. Just what I expected.  So I am only rating them four stars for this review for their lack of empathy and creativity, and for being less amazing than they used to be. But it really is my favorite date place so maybe next year, I'll give them the star back.

I purchased a $20 Groupon for Don & Charlie's valued at $40.  Three weeks before the Groupon expired, I called them to check on their hours. I got an voice mail recording that said "we will be closed Monday Memorial day THROUGH labor Day."   I was pretty pissed. That was 75% of the period allowed by the Groupon! I wrote to Groupon and asked for a refund since the place was closed.  Well, on the last day of the promotion, three weeks later, Groupon wrote back and said "Sorry for the confusion here. This business is open. Please call them at (480) 990-0900 to make your reservation Let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with"  So I called back.  It turns out they were only closed on Monday's during that time period. The message must actually have been "We will be closed "Mondays" Memorial day through Labor Day."  Well, I was out of state on that one day, and back the very next, one day after the promotion expired. So I called Don & Charlies and explained what happened and asked if they would honor the $40.  They said no. Only the $20, which they are required to do in the Groupon fine print. They said "it is the owner's call and that's what he said."  That is horrific customer service! One day late, a confusing message on their part, and a delayed reply by Groupon. Other vendors have been happy to honor a promotional value when there were odd circumstances like this.  I will never set foot in their restaurant and I hope those of you who value customer service choose not to as well.  And I hope the owner sees this review and learns something from it.

Update: Don C, the owner, replied to my comment with this: "Dear Anthony C, Thank you for your rant. Over 2100 guests redeemed their Groupons in the 90 days it ran. Since 1981 I have run D&C's with the guest always in my thoughts. Very happy to honor the $20.00 you spent. Best wishes, Don Carson"  My reply was this: "Very happy to honor the $20 I spent, is Groupon fine print policy, so of course you are happy to do it. By not honoring the full $40 value, you lost any chance of my being a customer and all of my friends. Which since I've lived in oldtown since 2004 and go out daily to it's restaurants and bars is not a small number of people. There are too many other places that serve a great steak (bandera's, citizen public house, cowboy ciao, etc)  You are correct, many other people did not get confused like I did. And I am happy for them. They are apparently more clever than I. I tried to come in. I heard your message on a Monday. I got confused. I lost out. If our roles were reversed, I would honor the full $40 groupon for you even if you were the ONLY person who got confused trying to come to my restaurant. Because I thought the purpose of a Groupon was to get new faces in the door.  Especially one that lives walking distance from my establishment and yet has never been in.  Finally, you say you always have the customer in your thoughts? Calling my review a rant is not good customer service. I hope that as folks read your reply they get a clearer picture of your customer service style.  In my opinion my review describes events and my feelings about those events in a logical way, not as a rant."  Now here is the best part: Groupon refunded me the $20.  So while Don and Charlie's accused me of ranting, Groupon, who has a FAR larger customer base heard my story and decided a happy customer was worth the refund.  They could have ignored my request given the huge number of clients they have and barely noticed my decreased spending with them.  That is Excellence in Service and I will continue to be a very loyal Groupon customer.  Groupon had this to say when I thanked them for my refund when D&C failed me: "Hey Anthony,   Thank you so much for the feedback! We appreciate feedback in all forms, but it's all the more gratifying when it's positive.   You've made my day, and we're so happy to have a customer like you. Thanks for your continued support!   Take care,   Shannon T.  Groupon Customer Support"  THIS is what fantastic customer service means. Groupon has my business forever. Not so D&Cs.

I went to Tomaso's as my 1st Restaurant Week stop. The service was absolutely great! I sat at the bar with a great bartender, Robin. He was knowledgeable and very excited about food, just like me.  When I mentioned I needed to skip dessert, he was happy to substitute and Italian wedding soup! That was very generous! It had no pasta, which is unusual for a wedding soup. Instead, diced white meat chicken took its place next to traditional and delicious little meatballs.  I came specifically for the zucchini blossoms, and they didn't disappoint! Beautiful, tasty, even the stems! Though I think they could have used a bit more salt. And after all that, I forgot to take their photo!  The shrimp on the shrimp and lobster ravioli was amazing!! Very meaty, no fishy flavor whatsoever, and the lemon sauce was perfect! The ravioli had a clear clean lobster flavor and perfect tooth bite.  #eatARW

Packed on Sundays due to 1/2 price specials  5 star: you MUST try this place at all costs! food/serv/atmos: 4/5/5  BEST OF OLDTOWN: Best gyoza (potstickers) in oldtown! First timers try: chicken gyoza, seared albacore Watch for: Nina and Emily  FOOD: lots of strong options and vegetarians say yum! Lots of great things and my vegetarian friends love their options. I recommend the chicken gyoza, seared albacore with TINY crispy onion strips, chicken yakisoba, squid salad, pork and veggie gyoza, and the shrimp tepanyaki but sub in the appetizer shrimp. Also good is the ramen. For rolls, the dragonball and the charlie sheen (always late and a total surprise) are interesting.  SERVICE: I like to sit at the bar. I always sit at the bar and the bartenders, especially Nina and Emily are sweet, fun and playfull. Many of my other favorites have moved on to Spanish Fly, owned by the same people along with Sting Ray and Jimmy Woos. Usually pretty fast, but on occasion the kitchen can slow down, so keep on them if you have been waiting long.  ATMOSPHERE: Must do stop for Sunday Nights. A must try for Sunday. I am there most Sundays at 9:15-10:15pm. Lots of beautiful people, lots of energy, and a perfect lead in to Sunday night carousing. Partly indoor partly outdoor main bar, Kareoke rooms, a very small sushi bar ledge and a two level floor set up that slightly elevates the back half of the restaurant. Oh, the big talk is the bidet in the bathroom. With lots of controls and services, your girlfriend may not be back from the restroom for a while... :)  AC Star Explanation: 5 star: you MUST try this place at all costs! 4 star: GREAT place! 3 star: good for variety, but there are a few better 2 star: avoid unless your date is excited to go here. 1 star: avoid even if your date suggests it...

Yelp  The Mission  RECOMMENDED FOOD: almejas al vapor RECOMMENDED PEOPLE: Brian Rabb, owner/manager ONE LINER: unique modern latin cuisine  HIGHLIGHT: Met a fun chatty lady at the bar and she was even bold enough to sample my food with me!  Overall: 4 star Food: 4 Service: 3 Atmosphere: 3  FOOD (taste, originality, plating): TASTE: The almejas al vapor are a must try.  The cheese plate is pricey for just one kind of cheese, but it came with apples, honey, sausage, prosciutto, pesto, honey cheese bread, and spicy chimichuri making it one of the most fun cheese plates i've had.  ORIGINALITY:  High.  Lots of new tastes and experiences.  PLATING:  Above average.  Not extreme, but better than average.   SERVICE (efficiency, charisma, helpfulness, menu knowledge) Poor. I sat a the bar, my favorite thing to do and was served by the bartender.  Charisma: Average: pleasant, but not a stand out guy. Efficiency: Low: forgot my drinks, hard to get his attention despite slow crowd.  His work ethic was tremendous however as he kept very busy on side work. Menu Knowledge: Poor.  Didn't know the answer to most of my questions. Helpfulness: Low.  he did recommend the almejas which were fabulous, but when his menu knowledge was low, he didn't try to find out the answers.  ATMOSPHERE (bad, average, interesting, amazing): average.  Booths, comfortable bar area, outside dining.  Star Explanation: 5 star: one of my arizona favorites! 4 star: great eats, recommended. 3 star: good eats 2 star: avoid unless with good company 1 star: avoid despite company

So far, every food item we've had at The Mission has been amazing.  Their must have item is the almejas al vapor.  But for our fourth visit, we went for a four course tequila tasting dinner for $65.  With tip and tax, $85.  Considering we spent that much on most of our "yelp eats" event dinners, all of which were three courses, each far less decadent and with no booze included, this was a GREAT deal...  Dos Lunas was the tequila brand hosting the event...  First Course: Roasted Pork Belly.  We had the pork belly during yelp eats.  That one was intense.  This one was even better!  And spicy from the Chile tepin.  It was on a peanut butter cream sauce, which may sound odd, but the heat, the peanut, the cherry margarita...  Wow.  If that was the best course, I was already satisfied.  First Course Drink: 5 small Cherry Margaritas.  FIVE.  EACH.  YUM.  We kept drinking them before the food got there and they felt compelled to refill us four times. :)  The cherry with the peanut cream sauce meal was an amazing compliment!  Second Course: Even better than the first!  I didn't think it could get better than the pork belly, but it did: Halibut.  It was perfectly cooked and had intense flavor. It was served over risotto that made my spine tingle with every bite!  Second Course Drink: Pineapple Coconut Frozen Margarita.  It was a lot like a pina colada.  Tasty.  Though large it went down fast!  I didn't feel it did anything for the Halibut the way the first drink did for the pork belly.  Third Course: It seemed impossible, but the third course better yet again. Filet Mignon.  And they don't even have that on their menu.  It tasted peppery, buttery, spicy and just so atypically full of flavor!  And of course it was the perfect tenderness.  It was topped with crab that was so succulent I finally had to scoop it off and eat it as two succulent courses to enjoy everything they offered.  Third Course Drink: A flight of three shots of Tequila: Silver, Reposado, Anejo.  The only difference: how long they sit in the barrel. 18 months for the anejo.  Three quick shots of tequila are always a great idea!  And the perfect compliment to that spicy filet.  Fourth Course: Stone Fruit Crumble Cake: the cake was ok.  It was topped with a Rum ice cream that was so potent I felt I was doing shots.  Rum after all that tequila wasn't the most exciting finale.  The dessert was the only let down, but with those first three courses, who cares!! :)  Fourth Course Drink: Iced Espresso Tequila Drink.  I am not a coffee fan, so I had to basically shoot this sucker down.  But everyone else seemed to really enjoy it.  Absolutely worth $85.  And then the finale came.  They let us have a half sized shot of the Dos Lunas Grand Reserve.  A 750ml (25oz) bottle costs $3000.  So a single 1oz shot of that would run over $120 retail, up to $500 in a resort bar.  So all by itself, this was more than we paid for the whole meal!  It tasted more like a cognac and not at all like an 11 year old tequila.  I would never pay that much for a shot, but man it was pretty cool to have.  GREAT event at the Mission.

Thursday they have free Texas Hold'em with great prizes for the top 3 players, the smallest of which is a bottle of booze to take home with you.  From Parrot Bay to Patron XO so far...  If you see me there and mention yelp... I'll buy you your first round! :)  Friday and Saturday it is back to being a swanky club.  Heidi, Andy and Anton are three bartenders that make me want to keep coming in with their great service and attitudes.  The room itself is rather simple, just a large box with two bars on either extreme.  What sets this club apart from the rest of the oldtown clubs is that people seem very approachable.  Whether saying hi to a stranger at the bar, or chit chatting outside on the smoking couches (where unfortunately we can not drink!!) people seem receptive to new faces.

The bacon Bloody Mary is spectacular! Both the mix and garnish are great, but the bacon is pure smokey deliciousness! On sat and sun from 10a - 3p, they are bottomless for $15! And that includes mimosas too! Both or either! Add in a flight of three different breakfast tacos (or four like I did by adding a single green chills pulled pork breakfast taco) and I'm on my way to another wasted day! Sitting at the upstairs bar you can enjoy a killer breeze!

I am a fan of the late night menu which starts at 11pm, has great deals, amazing food and ends at 1:30a! Late night gourmet on the cheap!  The regular menu is great too! Everything sounds odd when described but tastes like heaven when it arrives!  First timers:  App: pork belly pastrami or share the original chopped salad Main: the scallops or the porcini filet

Wadaa is attached to Barney's Boathouse and is both delicious and an incredible bargain. The menu consists of only two items, steak tacos and chicken tacos. The meat is marinaded beautifully so the flavors are intense and satisfying. And they are only $2 each! Incredible bargain! Cheese is an extra buck. You really will be blown away by something so tasty being so inexpensive!  It isn't advertised but they will also make you a quesadilla for the same price as a taco, and I find them a bit more filling! So if you want to get something a little bigger for the same price try one out!  You really can't beat this deal in oldtown and they are superb!

The service here is beyond impeccable. It is an art form. They are themed like a 20s movie, the uniforms are black lace dresses with tiny black and white frilled aprons and adorable. The upper level balcony is tight but cozy and overlooks Scottsdale Rd and 3rd. The menu is laid out like a script with plot twists and main story lines...  I ordered the four course tasting (up to seven are available) and made it chefs choice. My server, Loren, was beautiful beyond stunning and elegant as well. And so too were all the staff and my nearby dinner guests as well! They have a reverse happy hour which means this could be a good late night stop.  My first drink was the corpse reviver (appropriate as I was reading the hunger games as I was dining alone and lots of corpses in that book that needed reviving... and got it...), and it was refreshing like a lemonade. The GM even came out to say hello and share some excitement. And all the while, the music was great!  My first course was the inside out caprese which was amazing and complex and quite large for a tasting item! And the olive oil dust on it was unique and fun! It was followed by a perfectly sized sea bass over a bed of farrow, something I would never have picked, but man it was GREAT! I told Loren that I was avoiding sugar, so I wasn't interested in drinks with sweet and sour or simple sugars... she laughed and talked about how amazing their ingredients were and brought me my second drink... and it was delicious.  My third drink was a blueberry cobbler if I remember correctly. I could pick my second drink off the menu, but can't recall the name now and apparently some of my notes didn't survive the night. :)  After the sea bass I was served veal, and quite a large amount of it too. One piece on a bone, the other two not. I am not a veal fan, but I ate it and as far as Veal goes, it was right on.  My final course was the Prime steak and it was absolutely perfect. I avoid prime rib and rib eyes as I don't like fatty meats, but this one was trimmed perfectly, just full of amazing flavor and no fat at all visible. And the mango gelle was great!  Not only did the GM pay me a visit, but other waitresses came out to say hi, and then the owner! And then the chef! It is a rare treat to get to talk to a beautiful waitress, her wonderful colleagues, her GM, the owner and the chef all on your very first visit! Without a doubt, service is their number one mission and so is elegant unusual food!  This has moved into my number one spot for a pre bar hop dinner in oldtown and I will be going back again soon!
