It's just another 'Berto's' around the phoenix area. It is pretty similar to most of the other places with a similar name. The one thing that really stands out about this place is that not only do they have 2 drive threws bit they have a walk up window that is also open all nigjt long! This is a plesent feature to a 'fast food' place, i know im not the only one who has tried to walk up to a drive threw and try to order because the inside was closed only to be rudly turned away. Well this walk up window will prevent that from happening at this location. As far as the food goes, they serve you a very generous portion of food. The burritos are huge, stuffed with the meat of your choice, carne asada, fish, beef, chicken, carnitas and then your choice of cheese beans and sauces. Great for a late night meal after a couple drinks.

This place is amazing! The have a huge variety of DVD's, BlueRays, CD's, records, books and other items that you wont be adn le to find many other places. The other great thing about Zia is that that they carry new and used items, so if you dont mind a previously owned item you're able to  get it much cheaper then if you had to buy it new. They have so much stiff here you could easily spend a few hours looking around and not even notice. I will be back to this Zia location soon.

This place has some great BBQ, there's no other way to put it. The serving size they give you per plate are huge, you'll more then likly be taking some of your meal home with you to enjoy later. The brisket is what i would suggest, its amazing.

This place in conviently located on the vegas strip near MGM Grand and M&M store They have a pretty tasty 3.99 breakfast (yes 4 dollars on,the strip). Plus they have .99 cent bloody marys and a variety of breakfast cocktails for less then 5 dollars including patron margaritas. If you would like to save a little money and are awake before noon this place will provide a nice breakfast without leaving the strip.

What happened here? This mall is on the decline for sure, im pretty sure there are just as many vacant spaces as there are open stores. On top of that half the stores that are there i've never even heard of or seen anywhere else. This is a little surprising considering the area near this mall has been upgraded with more popular stores and restraunts.

This is one of my favorite sports bars in the area. Its a very laid back atmosphere. They have a ton of tv's at the bar and throughout the lounge and patio areas, great for watching mutiple sporting events at one time. The staff here is always helpful and the drinks are reasonably priced with great deals on food and drinks during happy hour. If you're l(oking for a great bar to catch a game or fight i'd suggest checking this place out

So my party and I went to Liquid on the first Tuesday they were open this season. First off the security at the Aria didn't even know the day club was open. The staff at Liquid seemed nice but there was a total of 8 guests excluding my party at the club. They have plenty of lounge areas amd cabanas for a busy day, but having to spend 65 dollars for a pitcher to reserve a lounge area around a unexpectedly small pool didn't exactly seem worth wild. Maybe on a weekend in peak season it would be a cool day club, but it just wasn't for us when we went so we left after 10 minutes.

This is probably the best smoke shop ive been to in the area. They have a very large variety of items from glass, tobacco and cigars. They have the widest options of hookah supplys and flavors that ive seen in any store. This os a place i'll be sure to go back too.

I love the concept of this place. Trays of sushi revolving around you, if you see it amd it looks good you cam just grab it and dig in. They have a good variety of sushi as well as a full menu you can order from. Each plate of sushi comes withe 2-5 pieces on it and depending on the roll ranges from 2 dollars to 6 dollars and are distinguishes by the color plate they come on. They take 50 cents off each plate during happy hour, which is nice because depending on how many people you have in your group it will save you a few bucks. It is also a great place to grab sushi if you're in a hurry, maybe on a lunch break from work. You are able to sit at the bar and help yourself to the sushi of your likeing without having to wait on your order being taken. This is also a great place to take kids or new sushi eaters. The concept will give them an imexpencive way try many different sushi rolls without breaking the bank. And for those of you that love sake bombers like i do, they are very resonably priced amd have a pretty good variety of beers to chooae from. This is a place i plan on visiting again soon and that i would definatly recomend to someone who has yet to tey sushi and to all you sushi lovers out there.
