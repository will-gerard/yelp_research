Ever sat at the barber shop and wondered how much longer this was going to take?  No more!  Izzy's motto "it's not the car, it's the driver, if a barber knows what he's doing, they don't need an hour to fiddle" definitely ad-libbed there at the end, but you get the gist.   He timed himself cutting my hair and clocked in at 13min! Definitely better than the usual hour I have to sit at the barbershop.   Provided recommendations on the cut and sounded like he had a vision for what my hair should look like. Will be coming back!

Don't expect the best customer service.  This is a no frills Chinese hole in the hall.   Prices are definitely where you would want quality Chinese food to be at!  $5 hainam chicken!  Also, came here expecting to order roti but apparently it doesn't come with sauce...

I travel to the midwest quite a bit for work and every time I'm there I definitely try to visit good barbecue restaurant.   I haven't been to many barbecue restaurants out in Arizona, and I am not sure whether I will ever try another barbecue restaurant.  Yes, this place was pretty bad... I ordered the two meat platter during off the lunch menu. Cost was $11.   First, they didn't have many options in regards to sites, I usually like to order collard greens, green beans, I like to have something green along with my meat.   Second, the brisket was pretty dry, however the one good thing they had on my plate was the turkey. I thought the turkey was cooked to perfection as it was moist and not dry    I had high hopes for this restaurant as it had 202 reviews and four stars, but I don't think I will be coming here again.
