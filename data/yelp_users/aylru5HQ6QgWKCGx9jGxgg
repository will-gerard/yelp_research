We had Dugan Plumbing come out as a result of a warranty claim with our Home Warranty Company.  Our initial experience was with one of their techs, and when he left our home, we believed everything was all set.  However, when we went up to bed that night, we found water throughout our master bathroom and into the carpet in our master bedroom.  We understand that "stuff" happens, and we wanted to give Dugan the opportunity to make it right.  Geoff answered the phone late that evening and  promised to have someone out in the morning again to take care of it.  When I expressed my concern with having the same tech out, he offered to come out himself and take care of the problem.  By late morning the next day, Geoff had come to the property and remedied the issue.  I asked him what we were supposed to do about the water soaked carpet.  He immediately got on the phone with his water restoration company and they came out within a matter of hours to set up remediation and protect our floors and baseboards.  Dugan's response to our issue demonstrates that when "stuff" happens, the good guys come out and make it right.

I contacted Rick at Kutting Edge after getting his name as a referral from another trusted landscaper who doesn't work in the area.  I first sent Rick an email asking for an estimate for my home and also offering to set him up as a vendor for our property management office.  After a week with no response, I called his line and finally spoke to Rick.  He told me that he was interested, and that he would come by the next day for an estimate.  I finally heard from him at about 2pm and he indicated that he was "really busy" and would text me when he was on his way.  5:30pm rolls around and he finally texts that he was on his way.  I had just about written him off as I was on my way out the door.  However, I waited for him and he provided what I felt was a very fair price for the work I asked him to do.  He at that time said he couldn't get to it for about a week because he was going out of town.  We set it up for the following Tuesday and at that time, I decided to go ahead and do a small amount of the work myself as we were having company that weekend.  When I adjusted the work that needed to be done, he said that it would still be his "minimum" charge of $150 to come out and do less than half of the work that originally was bid for $200.  At that time, I told him that I was hoping for less, but it is what it is.  We continued the plan for him to come on Tuesday.  Monday night he texts a reminder that he is coming the next day.  When asked for a time frame, he says 8-10am.  At 10:06, after we had been waiting for him, he sends me a text saying it would be "sometime that day" since he had another job take longer.  Fine...whatever...Then at 1:45pm, I get a text that reads "Hey...I'm sorry man.  I can't do business like this.  I have a full crew, tons of overhead, slammed to the hilt...I think you need to find another company to help you out".  Keep in mind...never did we argue about the price...never did I push back on his consistent delays.  He chose at that point (4 hours after the promised time of arrival) to CANCEL an appointment for a PAYING customer.  I would absolutely NOT recommend Kutting Edge and will be telling everyone that I can about this experience.

The technician came to our home as a result of a warranty claim filed with our home warranty.  The technician (Joe) came in and told us that the unit was low on freon and he was just going to charge it up and go.  When he was asked why he wasn't going to locate the leak, he replied "well I'm really busy, have to get to a parts supplier before they close, and it's also REALLY hot in your attic".  When we asked if the freon went out again would we have to pay the service call fee through the warranty company again, they said "yeah that's how they work".  Needless to say, we "convinced" him that it would be better to explore for a leak and then he tells us "well I can only inspect 1/2 of the coil so I'm still not sure if there's a leak there.  Stay AWAY from this company.  They tried to pull one over on my wife and it wasn't until she said she needed to call her husband that the tech seemed to backpeddle on what he was saying.  They seem to have their name wrong...should be "You'll Need A Better Air Conditioning Company".
