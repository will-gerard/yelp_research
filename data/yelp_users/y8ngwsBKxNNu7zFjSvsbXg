Si senor is one of my "go to" Mexican food restauarants. I love the chips and they serve them with green sauce, red salsa, a sour cream spicy dip,and beans. They are all great and the green definitely has a hot kick.   I like their food. I had stuffed sopapillas with shredded beef. I would like to have had more flavor in the beef but Ming it with the green sauce helps. I do love their rice and I don't often find a place that has good Mexican rice. Friends had the flauta plate, a tamale, tacos and enchiladas. Everybody was quite pleased with their lunch.   Sopapillas for dessert are great. I grew up in New Mexico where most Mexican food restaurants serve them for Dessert. They were light and flaky.

I've been going to Gilbert Veterinary Hospital for quite a few years now.  I had two cats that developed kidney problems, and they were absolutely amazing.  Dr. Bode and Dr. Focht are really great - they ask a lot of questions, gave me some great advice - and were always wonderful with my two cats.  Eventually I lost both of my cats to kidney disease, and they were so caring - and gave me a paw print of both my cats to keep.  After a couple of years of not having cats, I adopted two beautiful little girl kittens - and I wouldn't take them anywhere else.  They just received their one year check-up, and Dr. Focht was great as always.  She's so good with the cats - talks to them - and took a lot of time to answer my many questions and even discuss desert tortoises (we both have one).  I love Gilbert Veterinary Hospital!

We ate here during Arizona Restaurant Week.  I have to say - top notch service and great food. They were very attentive - never had even close to an empty glass and they were good about checking back with us without bothering us.   The steaks were absolutely amazing and loved that they had raw horseradish- my favorite.   For dessert we had cheesecake and the chocolate sin cake - both delicious. We were celebrating a birthday so we got a banana cream pie to go - also delicious.   Great birthday experience!!

I've used Molly Maid for a number of years.  I really like the current team that cleans my house.  Teresa is currently one of the two ladies that cleans my house - and she's always happy and she sings as she works - truly a pleasure to work with.  Maria previously cleaned my house, and she's also wonderful.  When they're done, the house always looks and smells so clean - and it saves me time to do other fun things.

A couple of friends and I went to Bamboo Club on Tuesday, January 7 for happy hour.  We sat in the bar.  We were greeted by the bartender in a quick timeframe and he took our drink orders and an appetizer order.  The first drinks and appetizers came out relatively quickly.  However, when another friend joined us, we ordered another appetizer.  After about twenty minutes, we asked the bartender about our appetizer and he apologized and said it was his fault.  At this point, we went ahead and ordered another appetizer because by now the original two appetizers were all gone.  A short while later, a server/runner brought the appetizer to us and then our second appetizer.  He didn't bother to take the two empty dishes from the table even though we had moved them to the edge to make it easy for him.  The restaurant was pretty empty, but the bar was pretty busy - however the bartender just couldn't keep up and the people bringing food weren't very friendly nor did they seem to care about taking away dirty dishes.  It was a good night to catch up with friends, but the service was just horrible.  Based upon other reviews I've read tonight, it seems like poor service is the standard at this location.

This is my third time eating at Craftsteak and hopefully not my last!!  The food is always wonderful.    For appetizers, we had the shellfish sampler and shrimp cocktail.  The portions were great - loved the lobster and crab.  I didn't eat any oysters, but my colleagues said they were good.    For dinner, I had the 10 ounce filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly - melt in your mouth - and seasoned just right.  My colleagues had a mixture of entrees - salmon with lemon basil pesto, New York strip, Ribeye - and everybody said their entree was delicious.  We shared different side dishes including asparagus, baby spinach, hen of the woods mushrooms, snap peas, potato puree and white corn grits.  The snap peas were great - lightly sauced with a little kick.  The white corn grits with bacon, cheese and chives was quite delicious as well.  I also enjoyed the spinach which is lightly cooked in garlic and olive oil.    For dessert, we shared a selection including monkey bread, chocolate cake, vanilla cheesecake, and a selection of ice cream and sorbet.  The monkey bread is delicious - has a great cinnamon flavor and love the pecan toffee sauce.  The chocolate cake is quite delicious - melt in your mouse.    Kevin was our server - amazing service and kept us laughing as well.  If I return, I would definitely love to ask for Kevin.

We ate at Zuzu during Arizona Restaurant Week.  I had the shrimp and scallop cocktail which was very delicious. A friend had the Caesar salad which he said was good. For entrees two of us had the short rib and one friend had the Asian salmon.  Both entrees were quite delicious and good portions. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the key lime pie. Both were quite delicious - with the key lime pie being very light with a good lime taste.   Service was phenomenal - very attentive server - and the place is so great looking - love the retro look!  Also a big fan of the Red Flower soap in the restroom - great smelling and quite fun name after recently watching The Jungle Book!

We attended at Oregano's in Gilbert. This was my first time so I didn't know what to expect but I ended up quite pleased.  It was a little strange at first with the cast members prepping the audience but we eventually started talking to others at our table, relaxed and settled in for a couple of fun hours.   The show was good - fun to have the interaction with all the guests including getting some of them up for dancing. It was hysterical. We saw Vampire's wedding - Madame Chinski is the best but all the cast members were great and kept us laughing.   I would definitely go see another show!

We went to see Murder at Greystone Manor at the Oregano's in central Scottsdale.  We recently saw a different mystery in Gilbert a month or so ago and we had family coming to visit us so we decided to take them.  The five of us sat with four other people at our table. The show was really funny. It is a little bit cheesy - but that's really part of the charm of it. The facial,expressions from Louise Lovelace and Jewel Precious are great - it's entertaining just watching that. Jewel - we love you!!   The food was good. It was Caesar salad followed by two pastas - Alfredo the dark and big rig pasta plus garlic bread and pizza. I love food at Oregano's so I thought it was good. Thr service from the mystery staff as well as Colby were very good - Colby definitely kept the drinks coming.   I would definitely do this again - of course with a different show. It's a lot of laughs.

I had dinner here with some friends a couple of weeks ago.  As appetizers, we ordered a half and half order of sweet potato and house cut fries, crispy coconut shrimp rolls, spicy edamame and crispy fish bites.  All of the appetizers were quite tasty.  The spicy edamame is definitely spicy - leaves your lips burning a bit - but they were oh so good.  I loved the pineapple horseradish sauce with the shrimp rolls - great pineapple flavor.    For dinner, I had the blackened wasabi Hapu - lightly blackened over wasabi mashed potatoes with seasonal veggies.  The flavor on the fish was good as were the potatoes but I'd like to have a little more kick for the potatoes - just a little more wasabi flavor.    We also had dessert - coconut cream pie.  You definitely want to save room for this.  It was very creamy - very rich - very delicious.  I believe Bailey was our server that night - absolutely wonderful - provided us with a lot of laughs and great service!

I had a really good dinner with some friends here recently.  We had their chile appetizer - which is a cheese-stuff chile wrapped in bacon and grilled.  It was so good that I got one with my dinner.  The chips are great - some spicy salt they put on them that gives it a good flavor.  We all ended up getting tacos - chicken, carne asada and carnitas - all on their Taco Tuesday special.  The portions were just big enough to fill you up without feeling too full.  The carne asada tacos had a really good flavor.    I had the watermelon margarita and a pineapple margarita - both were good although not very strong at all.    The service was good although we did ask for some grilled jalapenos and had to ask about them several times before they finally brought them.    I would definitely return to Sol.

we took some friends here from out of town. One friend had the salmon croquettes - actually quite large and she said they were very good. The other friend had chicken and waffles - said both were very good. I got the chicken and fish - fried fish was quite delicious and so was the chicken. Sides are also very good.  Portions are quite large here - you'll come away stuffed. Service was very good. Yeah for sweet tea!!

I ate here with five other friends for Arizona Restaurant Week. We had some drinks at the bar - happy hour prices - and the drinks were very good.   Once we sat down, four of the five of us ordered off the restaurant week menu. My gumbo was good as was my salad - and a big portion of salad too. I had the shrimp and grits - was quite good and I couldn't stop until I had finished all the grits.   Our biggest problem was service. The restaurant wasn't even completely full but it took forever to get each course - even the salads - and we had to ask for more water - wait staff wasn't very attentive and it really shouldn't take almost three hours to eat a meal here.
