I went here to get a massage after rave reviews from a friend and being reasonably priced because I pulled a muscle in my neck and I needed it worked out.  Very friendly girls and the place is very nice, everyone was very professional (even the massage therapist.)  The guy starts with my legs and was working on them for a while and I was starting to think man, time is going really slow! And then a lady peeps her head in to tell him times up.. He thought I was getting a 90 min massage when I really wanted a 39 minute.  The therapist quickly tells me to lay on my stomach and massages my back and arms for maybe 5 minutes? Didn't even touch my neck.. but hey! My legs feel wonderful! I kinda feel cheated just because I'm still in pain, and I really wish now I would have just offered to pay him to fix my neck.. I want to go back to finish the job but I'm scared it's going to happen again and I don't want to waste my money..

I am a vegetarian, therefore I get the veggie tacos.. But I really wish they had a veggie burger!! The chocolate chile shake is my go to "I'm feeling lots of feelings" shake and it's perfect!

The beer selection is great, and I usually just go for the beer.. On Wednesdays the burger and beer for 10$ is awesome but the veggie sandwich is kinda  veggie patties would be great!
