It's 9 pm and all the workers are pretending like they're closed....doors are locked. Lame!

Love it! Lots of options.  Great service.  Only place I go.

Female skinny bartender is a complete bitch. Totally inattentive and just hangs out with her boyfriend instead of serving. Have experienced this about 3 times in the last week. Time to find a different hangout downtown.

Used to be so good! First let me say that they are always courteous and accommodating. But, beyond that, it's all about speed. The last gel mani I got, they didn't clean up the sides of the nails and I had to clean them up myself. Then one was smudged and they refused to fix. Only 3 days later they started to peel off. I usually go to pink polish which is farther away because theirs always last 3 weeks and now I always will. So sad. I like the people but the work the do is very sub par.

I highly recommend this surgeon. It's been a year since my surgery and I am still pain-free!
