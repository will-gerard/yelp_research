I have been here before but I just had the most wonderful experience here.  The service was really fast and the waitress Amethyst was so nice and friendly.   I love to have Sriracha on my gyro and this place nailed it. I ate the pesto fries and a gyro with Sriracha and it's exactly what I was looking for.  Price: 20 bucks got two gyros and pesto fries. Me and tony are like kings. We sat down but it was fast enough to get it to go.

What a HORRIBLE place I ordered an appetizer it was 16 dollars and came with 4 slider burgers and 4 wings! It was essentially 2 dollars per item! The menu did not specify how many it came with. Needless to say I'll never order food there again.

I went to mikes for the first and last time today. Firstly 32.xx for a cheesesteak and onion rings and a drink is cray. I went to Texas Roadhouse the night before and got a meal for me and my partner we paid 35 dollars (including tip) and got 4 or 5 times the fresh meat and food mikes wanted to serve.   I explained to Mike that I didn't want to pay that much and he SET IT OFF on me talking about how he barely makes his rent, and how he brings in the meat fresh, and he had the audacity to say that since I don't own a food joint I can't say anything about prices. Of course I told him that the conversation was inappropriate to have with a Customer but he carried on and than in the end gave me a discount.   Good food but not worth the price or the additive the owner had.

If you HAVE to come here plan for it to be at LEAST an hour or two and don't come right after they come back from lunch.

Henry is a great lawyer. Law truck is an innovating new law firm that offers great prices on services. There is nothing like law truck they bring legal counsel to you. Henry has dedicated himself to this work and he cares about his client's. His willingness to go the extra mile shows significantly in the work he's done for me - keep up the good work.
