Being that I am a New Orleans native, this is by far the most authentic Cajun food i have found in the valley. The wait staff is always friendly and even remember me most of the time. They serve a lot of New Orleans drinks including Abita beer. The seafood gumbo is awesome! For lunch you can get a half poboy and a cup of soup which is the perfect lunch portion. I tell anyone that asks me about finding good Cajun food to go to Baby Kay's. Can't wait until their new location opens.

Best place to get ice cream cakes. This location has a much better variety in both size and flavors than many of the other Baskin Robbins locations. The owner is typically in the store and always very nice and accommodating.

One of my favorite lunch spots! Inexpensive but authentic mexican food. The bombero burrito is worth the drive. One of the spiciest mexican dishes ive had, but not overwhelming spicy. When visitors come to town and want authentic mexican food, we take them to Los Toquitos. Our visitors have all requested to go back anytime they come in town. I highly recommend checking this place out.

The healthmex chicken burrito is a good option for tasty mexican without all of the calories. The staff is always really nice and its a quick somewhat healthy meal.

Very happy with the services provided!!! Dr. Balke was extremely thorough when explaining what needed to be done to our dog as well as allowing as much time as needed for questions. They sent me a picture of her and she was actually smiling while she was there. After the procedure he showed me pictures and explained everything that was done that day. The checkout process was very easy as well. Dr. Balke even called that evening to check on our dog. Yes, it may be a little more expensive than what you are used to paying for dental work, but I feel the cost was well worth it. Two days after her procedure our dog seems almost back to her old playful self and I think a big part of that was due to the excellent care she received!

Arena is a great place for all ages. The restaurant side accommodates families with children well. The bar side is also nice because there are plenty of tables to sit down and eat. Lots of tv's in the place which is nice for watching sporting events. Service is always excellent and in the 6 years we have been going to Arena, we often see a lot of the same staff still working there and still happy to be there. The queso appetizer is really good and served in a edible chip bowl. My favorite meal is the buffalo chicken pasta. You cant go wrong with adding buffalo chicken and pasta together :) It's not your fancy Scottsdale sports bar, but thats what we like about it. You can come as you are and enjoy good food and great service.

We use Banfield as our Vet and have been very disappointed in this location. The computers are synced to the other Banfield locations, but they refused to sell me heartworm preventative even though I was current on the tests for my dog because I didnt have the test performed at this location. They could see I was current and even stated that. I had to drive over to the Banfield location I use regularly and they explained that is not a policy and the staff just must not have wanted to deal with it. Prior to this experience I used the Vet here once and he didnt give me much time and seemed annoyed with my visit although it was a routine check up. I would rather drive a little further than ever go back to this location.

Jillian is amazing!  After relocating back to the valley I was looking for a new salon. I didnt know where to go so I tried my stylist (not at VOLR) that I went to before I moved and was frustrated that she was always running behind, double booked and never listened to what I wanted.  You will never experience any of those at Volr! Jillian has been on time and has great ideas on changing up style! She listened to what I wanted and had great suggestions. I had let my hair grow for almost 4 years and felt comfortable enough to let Jillian cut almost 6 inches off of my hair on my first visit. I have been twice now in the last 3 months and will be going back in the next week or two. Happy to have found a salon and stylist that I am comfortable with! I would highly recommend the salon and specifically Jillian to anyone.   And my husband would recommend her as well because he is happy that he doesn't have to hear me complain about my hair anymore... I absolutely love my new cut and my color!

This is a great spot for lunch. The patio is a nice place to sit for a business lunch or even a casual chat with a friend. The ahi tuna tacos were excellent. The tacos come with all of the ingredients separate so you can put as much or as little of everything as you would like on the tacos. The only thing i didnt like was the soda in a can because I just don't like being served cans of soda at a restaurant. Especially when they charge 2.00 for the can.

Yasu is not at all what you would expect by looking at it from the outside. It is a rather small restaurant, but that adds to the ambiance. We went on a Saturday night and it was pretty full. Customers ranged from families to couples out on date night. We were greeted immediately and the service was excellent. The server explained everything on the menu (there are a few different menu's) and offered his advice after asking what we were looking for to eat. The drinks were good and the food was fresh. The menu offers items you don't typically find at other sushi restaurants in the valley. The boneless ribs on the 5.00 menu were excellent as was the seafood fondue. The prices do get a little expensive with some items, so it is worth checking out during the times where they are running the food specials if you are really hungry. Overall a really nice and unexpected experience. We will be back again to eat there soon!

My husband and I went to Fuego Bistro last night for restaurant week and had a great dinner. It was 8:00pm reservations so the weather was perfect. We sat on the patio where there was live music playing! The restaurant week menu can't be beat. Appetizer, Entrée, Dessert and Sangria all for $30.00 per person. The entrée itself would have cost 30.00, so the restaurant week menu is a great deal.  We had the empanada for appetizers and they were very tasty. For an entrée I had the Fuego pasta and my husband had the chili releno. We were both surprised at how large the portions were. 2 sides accompanied our meals and we both got the cornbread and I had mashed potatoes and he got the jalapeno corn.   Overall great food, great atmosphere and we will be going back very soon!

It is really a shame that this location closed down because it was my favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix. Martini's were tasty and the spicy beef appetizer( lava beef) is amazing. BBQ shrimp were really good too. Worth the drive to their Gilbert location still open if you are looking for good sushi

Best time to go is for Happy Hour. They have great food and drink specials during Happy Hour although it gets fairly filled up quick. If you go on a Friday you will have to get there somewhat early. The patio is nice to people watch since the movie theatre is close by. The beer selection is vast and the staff is pretty knowledgeable when figuring out which beer is best. Gave it 4 stars because if you go anytime other than Happy Hour the food and drinks are a little expensive

The restaurant is located in a strip mall, but not strip mall quality food at all. The Phoenix and Dynamite rolls were both good. The menu tells you what is both inside and outside the roll so easy to choose menu items if you have dietary restrictions.

I went in for a pedicure and left disappointed. I was asked to take a seat in a chair for my pedi and the water was freezing. When asked for it to be hotter, I was told they would be right back and 5 min later I was still sitting there (with my feet now out of the water because I was cold). When they finally got to my pedicure it was rushed and the menu of services for a pedicure was like a dinner menu. They seemed to be more worried about getting me in and out rather than if i was happy with the service. Also, you can not add gratuity to your credit card so if you don't have cash... Too bad! I went one other time to get nails put on a few years ago and my nail was crooked. When asked about it, the employee told me my finger was crooked and not the nail. I tried to give the place another chance, but after this last experience I will not be going back

A hidden gem in north phoenix. I brought a pair of suit pants to get hemmed and it was $10.00. Yes only $10.00!!! Yesterday I brought the same pair of pants for the same alteration and was quoted $24.00. I explained that I needed the pants as quickly as I could get them and she told me they would be ready tomorrow! Less than 24 hour turn around for half the price I was quoted somewhere else. Really nice people and they deserve a ton of business.

Service has gone down significantly since the investigation. Usually they do a great job, but today it took forever just to get a basic car wash. I had to ask them to vacuum out my car when I got in it because they "forgot" to do that. Longer waits and lower quality washes will make me look elsewhere to get my vehicle washed going forward.

Great lunch specials. Service is usually pretty quick as well. The Hawaiian chicken and the pad Thai were both really good. Portions are fairly large for lunch. Worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for Thai food

My husband and I have been to Humble Pie a few times and enjoy both the food and the drinks. They also offer good happy hour specials. My favorite drink is their red sangria. They also have a good Caesar salad and the pizza's have all been tasty. Its a smaller restaurant inside, but the service is always great and the patio offers additional seating.

We stayed in this hotel due to renovations at our home and we could not have picked a better hotel. We initially chose it because it was close to our home and allowed pets. Upon arrival the staff was friendly and prompt. The entire hotel and property is non-smoking which is great for people like myself that do not like smelling smoke in the hallways or common areas. The staff understood we needed to be close to the exits because of the pets and frequent walks so they put us on the 2nd floor right next to the staircase. Our suite is one of the nicest We have stayed in for an extended stay hotel. Everything was clean and well maintained. Rooms were quiet and a lot bigger than what I expected. We will definitely recommend friends and family stay here when they come to visit us.

Brio has a great happy hour. It is only valid in the bar and patio area, but the weather is perfect to sit outside right now and it makes for great people watching. You can't go wrong with the Tuscan Tasters for $3.95 each. My favorite is the shrimp and eggplant. Best part of the meal was our waitress, Kimberly. She was so personable and had great recommendations on everything from which Sangria to chose to dipping the hamburger in the sauce that comes with the shrimp and eggplant. We will definitely be back.. And will request Kimberly.

I ate lunch here a few weeks ago and it was a nice change from the food you usually find here in AZ. The Kool-Aid and Tea served in Mason Jars was pretty need. I had the chicken tenders and waffle combo and to my surprise, I liked it! The service was good, not great, but good. Portions were large and the food was good quality. I will eat there again for sure.

Very disappointed with this location. I was told they were out of sausage breakfast sandwiches and then someone 20 minutes after me was able to get a sausage sandwich while I was sitting right there. No sense of urgency by anyone working there and it seems understaffed no matter when I go in.

Service is always pretty good at this location. They offer happy hour on weekdays but only in the bar area and patio. While the prices have gone up a bit on the regular menu, happy hour still offers $3.00 appetizers.

Service is always terrible! My husband and I have been here 4 times now and have yet to get in and out in less than an hour. Tonight we waited 26 minutes to place our order when we knew exactly what we wanted when we walked in. Waitress brought our drinks and said she would be right back and we kept trying to flag her down and nothing! It was busy, but there is no reason she couldn't take our order (ive been a waitress myself). The food is ok for a sports bar type atmosphere but not worth dealing with the terrible service. I gave it a few chances before writing a review, but we won't be going back after another disappointing LONG visit.

Seasons 52 is always our "go to" spot for dinner when we can't decide what to eat because there is always something we will both enjoy here. Service is always excellent and I love the fact everything on the menu is less than 500 calories. The shrimp flatbread is an excellent started. With the ever changing menu, i always try to find one of the shrimp dishes and have yet to be disappointed. Good quality food and good service makes this one of my favorite places in Phoenix.

We recently used Lucky Me Pet care over the Thanksgiving holiday and couldn't be happier we did. From the initial conversation with Heather, the owner, I felt comfortable with the company. She came to our house for an initial assessment and took notes of where we kept everything and wanted to make sure that she understood what we needed/expected from a sitter. Nick was the actual sitter and did a great job. He left us very thorough notes of each visit and sent us a few pictures of our girls while we were out of town. We had the overnight stay along with daily mid day visits and the prices were very reasonable, especially over a holiday weekend (no up charge for holidays). When we came home our yard was picked up, the water bowls were full, our dogs were happy and everything was as we left it. Can't say enough good things about the company and we will definitely be using them for all of our dog sitting going forward.

My husband and I used Daryl/Moldex for our mold remediation and couldn't be happier that we did. Not only was he very fair with the pricing, but he was a wealth of knowledge on the subject of mold and best ways to remediate it. The testing offered by Moldex is less expensive than many of the other companies and all around he is great to work with. I highly recommend using them if mold is a concern at all, even if you just want your home tested for it.

I always enjoy trying new places. The burgers were good and the menu includes a wide variety of burger options. Good beer selection as well. Service was a little slow, but we arrived at the same time as a large group that took up half the restaurant. I will definitely go back because the burger was tasty and I enjoyed the meal.

I placed an order today for several "try 2" combos with sandwich and either salad or soup to go. All of the sandwiches and soups/salad were excellent. Good portions at a very reasonable price. Tiffany was very helpful and even gave me a drink while I waited for my order. I will definitely be back very soon.

Ive tried Mello Mushroom at both Norterra and at this location in City North. I like this location a lot better. The service is good and I really enjoy the buffalo chicken pizza with ranch and not blue cheese. The pizza is a bit expensive and I would recommend asking for the pizza to be "well done" if you like your crust crunchy, but overall we were happy with the food and will be back.

Food truck friday was a really neat experience. There were 9 food trucks available today and offered everything from burgers to hot dogs to poboys to ice cream. It appeared a few of the trucks had vegetarian items as well as dairy free items for people with dietary restrictions. I looked at the menu from all of the food trucks and everything looked good. The burger place was by far the most popular with a line of about 20 deep. I tried the jan burritos Cajun truck and it was really good. 1.50 for a can soda was a bit much but the burrito was a large portion and really good. Worth checking out on a friday because there is music playing and its a really nice atmosphere. Only runs from 11-1:30 and it gets busy around noon so try to get there by around 11:30 to avoid longer lines

One of my favorite fast food places. Cane's started in Louisiana and they were everywhere in New Orleans. It is nice to see more popping up in the valley. They only focus on chicken and they know how to do chicken right. Sweet Tea is great! My personal favorite is the #1 no coleslaw extra toast, but you cant go wrong with anything on the menu. It is a little more expensive than some of the other fast food places, but the quality of food is worth it.

The southwest chicken salad is amazing. The half muffalata and cup of gumbo is also really good. The staff at this location is very friendly and accommodating. While it is a self service restaurant, the staff constantly walks around to see if you need drink refills or if there is anything they can get you. Its good food at a great price and has become a regular weekend lunch spot for me. The tea is also really good if you like tea. Coupons are regularly available for 3.00 off an entree from money mailer so make sure to look for one before going, but if you find it online it must be printed.

Blue 32 is a pretty good sports bar. We sat outside and they were accommodating with our request on the tv's. I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread which was better than i expected and the frozen sangria is excellent. Food is a little more expensive than most sports bars, but it is a good place to grab dinner if going to the movies next door. Happy hour specials are descent but only run Monday-Friday.

Rene just left my home after cleaning my air ducts and I couldn't be happier! Not only did he keep in contact with me about what time to expect him, but he could not have been nicer! He did a very thorough job cleaning the ducts and even went above and beyond to check my A/C unit for any signs of air pollutants. I will definitely be using this company, and specifically Rene again very soon! I highly recommend this company for anyone that needs their air ducts cleaned.

For some reason this company shows up twice on yelp so I wanted to add my review to both listings so everyone knows how great they are! Rene couldn't have been nicer and I really felt like he went above and beyond while at my house. Although our air ducts were not very dirty, he checked out A/C unit to see if there were any signs of mold or mildew to ensure our air quality was good. He was polite, thorough and timely which i have found is not very common in the service industry anymore. I highly recommend using this company for your air duct cleaning and specifically Rene!

Would not recommend using this company. The monthly service price is well above the average in this area and does not include chemicals. Make sure to pay attention to additional charges written on the contract and read what you sign. Owner is not wiling to work with you and I would not recommend this company. Only reason for the 2 star rating is because the guy that came out to clean the pool did a good job. Not a good value (even if you find a deal on their service) because it seems like with all the extras it adds up. 120 per month plus 10.00 per week for chemicals is double what the previous homeowners company charged for same service.

Very disappointed with experience at McFaddens. As we were sitting down, a couple walking out told us not to waste our time here. We should have listened. They did just open and are probably trying to work out the kinks, but the food was not very good. The bar also promoted an appearance by Daniel Tosh and when asked when he would arrive, we were told it was just a raffle for tickets to his show (even though the flyer on their website specifically stated picture opportunities with Daniel Tosh). They falsely advertised to get people into the bar, but lost a customer here by doing so. The fact that I live very close, I was really hoping this would be a new spot to hangout. Unfortunately all I can say is that I will not be back! The only bright spot of the entire night was our waitress who was very sweet and also seemed surprised that the appearance being promoted was in fact, nothing more than a marketing ploy!

After having my first review deleted I thought it was important to post another. While the new patio is nice, the food and service is lacking. Restaurant seems unsure of its identify! We ordered wings and they were mediocre. The nachos were also nothing to write home about. Server didnt know what the specials were for the night and seemed annoyed that we asked her to find out for us. We were excited for a new bar/restaurant to open, but after giving the place a try twice now we will stick to going to other restaurants in the area.

I wanted to take a minute to let everyone know how great this place truly is! Not only is it a clean and relaxing environment, but the staff is also friendly and knowledgable. The place is seriously cleaner than any doctors office I have been in.   They offer so many different options and can customize the drip to your specific needs. I have tried a few different drips and boosters and I am very happy with the results from all of them. My husband and I have been getting drips weekly for the past two months and I am so happy we found The Drip Room. I will admit that I was very skeptical about the whole idea of IV drips at first, but the skeptic in me is gone after feeling the results of the drips. Another added benefit is that you can feel at ease knowing you are dealing with Medical Professionals that actually know what they are talking about.   Whether you partied too hard and need a cure for a hangover or would just like a boost to your immune system, make sure to check out The Drip Room!
