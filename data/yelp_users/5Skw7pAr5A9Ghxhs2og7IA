It takes a special person to be a hair stylist; they are stuck working on one person's hair for an unfortunate amount of time...in proximity only allowed to OBGYNs, dentists and hair stylists.   Everyone thinks they are an easy client, fun to talk to...but are they? The stylist has to put up with dozens of personality types, bad breath, boring stories, questionable hair ideas, etc. Some clients are fun... some....not so much.   A stylist has to be excellent at his craft and able to read people. Strangely, hair is such an emotional artifact of a person's lifestyle - it sounds dramatic and silly, but it's true. The stylist has to be a hair psychologist in order to be successful. Sometimes you, as a client,  walk in and state, "I want a huge change...how about a perm - I hear the eighties are in again." He or she has to know that you might be having a bad day, or didn't take your medication that morning...it's a lot of responsibility. Who wants to be responsible for a hormonal bang decision?   Jeff Warner is that special type of person who has creative talent and is able to mix it with the uncanny ability to read people.  Not only is Jeff Warner amazingly talented as a hair stylist, he is also extremely funny and easy going. I can't imagine a better person to trust my hair to and share my stories with. I am happy that he has found Hair Stalgia - it is a convenient location and the people are friendly and authentic. Just like Jeff!   Thank you Jeff for tempering my hair moods and always making me laugh. You are the best!

Love the breakfast burritos - it has become a Saturday morning tradition in our house. We also pick up lunch or dinner from time to time. The people are nice and the food is good. I am not looking for anything other than what it is and I like it what it is! I would LOVE it if they delivered. :)

My husband and I were hesitant to venture into The Cove Grill because we thought it was just a neighborhood dive bar (not that I have anything against a good dive bar, but we have a three-year-old, so we don't get to check out the neighborhood dive bar scene very often). We've been driving by it for a few years, it was called Boathouse or something similar  and wondered what was happening in that little corner behind CVS.  We saw the Groupon, didn't buy it - wish we would have - and saw pictures of The Cove. It didn't look like the dive I imagined in my dreams (a place with no windows, filled with smoke, hiding in a corner of a strip mall...). To my surprise, there were kids, windows and they had fish on the walls.  Long story short - I love this place and the only thing I want to complain about is they aren't open tonight. I want to go!

I agree with another post: Do not use this spa for anything!    A year ago I went to this med spa with a Groupon and had an unpleasant experience. I showed up and they didn't have my appointment, I couldn't get an appointment for weeks, the receptionist gave me the wrong information, etc. As someone else said, you get what you pay for.  I received a Groupon this year for Christmas from my husband. He was excited to give it to me and did not have any idea about my experiences with the med spa. I didn't mention it to him and decided to give them another try - why not...things can change.    They didn't. I made an appointment - again weeks to get in (although a nice receptionist did help me when I had to reschedule my appointment for a meeting-she found an appointment within a couple weeks of my cancellation). I talked to the receptionist about my Groupon and what it would cost for extra units outside of my Groupon, etc.   I took time from my extremely busy work schedule and arrived at Two Drops only to be told that I cannot use my Groupon because I wasn't a first-time client. "If I had read the fine print, I would see that it says it is valid only for first-time clients." She repeated this over and over - completely condescending.   Disrespectful. Extremely awful customer service and condescending. They just want quantity and don't care about quality. They are fine with letting people line up like cattle to get their Groupon's redeemed - they don't look for long-term clients. Great business model.   Okay. Fine. I didn't read the fine print. I got it as a gift!!!! Why would I read the fine print when I got it as a gift?  How would my husband have any idea about what med spa I like or don't like?? Or where I've gone before? We talk about more interesting topics. I was excited about the gift and thought it was cute that my husband was excited and hesitant to give it to me (he didn't want me to take offense). They were willing to put the amount towards the treatment, but I couldn't get what I was given. The thing that made me so irate was I got it as a gift! It was clearly a gift and they wouldn't honor it. I wanted to get what my husband had given me! I really didn't want to give them one dollar more - for obvious reasons. I was so angry that I stormed out and I am not someone who storms, but both times I've been there I've been treated with a condescending and disrespectful attitude.    This isn't a good place.
