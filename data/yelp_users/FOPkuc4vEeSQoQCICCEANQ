Went here this morning and picked up some macarons for me and my friends at work. I love the key lime one. I will defiantly be back since it's so close.

I ate there yesterday and it was great. I like trying out specialty rolls at new sushi places. I got a Twinky and it was great. Although I was kinda expecting it to be yellow.

I had to put my Buddy in the shop for an engine rebuild. I got it back a day early. My scooter is running better than ever and it's not smoking anymore. They also put a metal plate over a chip that broke off when the trunk bracket broke and hit the back area behind the seat. I've gone there before  for work and it's pretty much the only place around that will work on Buddy's.

Been here twice. Once for half price bottles of wine and pizza for happy hour. And today got the Lobster Mac n cheese that I saw on the menu last time. Too much for one sitting. I guess I'll have awesome leftovers tomorrow....oh darn.

It started off okay, but once summer came along so did the scorpions. I got stung twice and found another 11 that I've killed not to mention the once I thought were dried leaves on the top for the entry door. They've sprayed but that really doesn't mean anything to them. "Oh we're changing companies, blah, blah, blah." WORD OF CAUTION: tap out your shoes and don't have your mattress on the ground, they like to cuddle. Your neighbors upstairs like to vacuum at 11:30 at night, not sure why, they are heavy-footed too. On Friday and Saturday nights you can hear your neighbors playing music at what seems like would be a deafening level if you where in their apartment. The planes overhead didn't really bother me but they start somewhere around 6AM. You can tell which ones are coming in low. Once my A/C unit began to leak because I could hear dripping near the door. Maintenance came to fix it and it stopped dripping. I had to soak up the water and put a fan on the area so it wouldn't smell later on. Too bad a few weeks later mushrooms sprouted near the wall. Don't worry they spray an anti-fungi stuff on the wall and the carpet under the A/C unit. They had to tear off the paint (ONLY the paint) and repaint. Watch where you step if you want to take a shortcut across the grass some people with dogs don't think it's their responsibility to put up after their animals. The only good thing I can say about this place is that it's walking distance from downtown and the festival. Close to the light rail. My neighbor across the way was pretty cool also. I know it could have been worse but it sure as heck was anything good. I'd post pics if I could.   Previous tenant of Apartment 149 aka "The Scorpion Den"

This place is great. Great value for the amount you get. Flower shaped carrots are a nice detail.

DON'T RENT FROM FOX RENT A CAR - PHOENIX SKY HARBOR!!!   I rented two vehicles while mine was in the shop. I notice a cracked driver's side mirror the day after. I called in to have the person note this so I would not be charged for damage I didn't cause. I even noted on the incident report that it was like that before I picked it up. The cracks were so slight I thought they were spider webs on the mirror. Now they want repairs to the tune of over $280! The mirror was broken not hanging off the side of the door. I emailed Mary Parker at their damage center after I got a letter that they wanted money for repairs not even detailing what car or the repairs. Both my deposits were returned in full because I was reassured by the inspector that I wouldn't be charged. And I have an email where she says that "I am responsible for damage to the vehicle if I did it or not". So I'm on the hook for previous renter's damage?   If you must rent from this company, DON'T, spend the extra $40 - $50 to rent elsewhere. After that DON'T get any of their stupid insurance, thankfully I didn't, check with your current car insurance company if your policy covers rentals. Lastly, don't sign ANY sort of incident report even if the idiot inspector say that you won't be charged for it. These parasites will suck every last dollar you have. This is the last time I will opt for a cheap rental company.   After writing to Mary and wanting to speak with her supervisor I haven't heard back. can't call either because the don't pick up the phone.

Their "spicy" Bison burger has no kick at all, the spicy ketchup at Whataburger has more heat. Only really had cheese, meat and sauce on a bun, nothing else. It's was a very meh burger at a higher price of other really good burger places close by. All the stuff on their menu was overpriced. I'd pass on this place.
