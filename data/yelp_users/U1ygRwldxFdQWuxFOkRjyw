Beware!! Food is awful. Had a cheese steak sandwich, it was dry and cold. Almost choked on every bite! I was too hungry and it was to late to go anywhere else or I would of... French fries came out cold and undercooked && DONT order the iced tea... I think it was brewed 3 months ago... Very sad because it's one of the few restaurants in my area that are open late.

The best hotel/ resort I have stayed at in Arizona yet. The rooms are like a mini house with a full size couch, and fridge inside. All of the rooms have a private balcony and that was nice. Huge walk in shower with a jacuzzi bathtub. The bed was Tempur-pedic and I never wanted to leave it! The staff were very friendly and nice. I would stay here over and over again.

Best place for pizza and also by far the best costumer service. I love stopping into Rays just to even say hi to the employees. They are amazing and the pizza is the best!

Met the owner. Nicest guy in the world. Had a blast. Everybody was super friendly & I'm going to keep coming back. What a great neighborhood bar. Thank you Jack!

I have been going to AZ 88 for two years now and my boyfriend has been going in for over 10+ years! We absolutely love this place! The martinis are better than any martini I've ever had! You also have to try the Hells Fire Chips! We order them every time! But I would like to point out, we were in there last night and Jemar was by far the best waiter I have ever had. Did things that stood out that no other waitress or waiter has done. Was very polite and professional. We really hope to get him again!!

My favorite Starbucks! They are always so much fun when I go in and make great conversations. The drinks are always good!

Service was okay.. First time coming in.. There was four of us and none of us liked the food. It was over cooked and we felt like we were eating left overs.

I have been going here for I would say over two years now. I will not go anywhere else. I drive all the way from Scottsdale just to get my nails and toes done. They are the absolute best. If you want the best designs ever... Ask for Lily... If you want a great laugh ask for Kyla.. Get nails and a sweet lady ask for Tilly..  If you're getting a pedicure ask for Laura or Rose! But make sure you call for an appointment if you want any of them ;) they sure are popular!

My boyfriend and I are avid Starbucks customers.. (twice a day at least) Every time we have been to this location we have been treated rudely by the same two girls that seem to run the counter (Taylor & Tori) Taylor has been so rude to the point of putting her finger in my boyfriends face telling him to "hold on" And on top of that they never seem to get you drink orders correct. Today I will give you an example of how we ordered 3 drinks, got two of them and waited for the easiest drink for a good 5 minutes. A red eye.. (Brewed coffee with one shot of espresso)  I would highly recommend going to the Starbucks on thunderbird and Tatum if you're in the neighborhood. They are awesome!
