We just came in for an early dinner around 4:20pm, both hostesses greeted us and sat us immediately then told us our server "M" will be right with us. As we checked out the menu and their new little computer gadget on the table, I looked up and realized another table after us was already getting served their soup and salad... About 5-10 minutes had passed and even with our "call server" button blinking, nobody came, so I decided to walk up to the front and asked the hostess ( manager was standing about 8 ft away) if we had a server because another table has already been greeted and started to get their food. She apologized and went to go look for her, a few seconds later the blonde hostess decided to just get our whole order since our server was busy or couldn't be found, we thanked her. A few moments later our server popped her head around the corner and asked if our drink orders had been taken, didn't introduce herself or apologize for the wait or even really come to our table... She then dropped off our soup and salad, my boyfriend asked her to grab red pepper if she had time, and apparently she didn't because he never got it, even with his second soup. Our food came out super quick, which was nice since I was starving, then not even 5 minutes later our buy one get one meal came out too.. Felt a bit rushed, but proceeded to check the bag to make sure our to go meals were correct, one wasn't. I let our server know one was incorrect and she swapped it out.. While working on my meal I was still munching on my salad, breadsticks and a bit of my boyfriends soup, our server came up and started taking away all of our plates... Awesome on pre bussing! But she never asked if I was finished and just took them away, she seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out so I didn't even say anything.. Our drink was low and wanted another one eventhough the drink had no free refills, and we wanted dessert as well but our server never asked and just dropped off the check.. Atleast she asked if I needed a box for my meal I didn't finish...  Downfalls were..  Lack of real service from our server. Management never even came over when he had plenty of opportunities to see how things were going or to appologize. After a mess up like that don't dodge your table, you should be trying to make it up. Rushing us out even though we were super polite was kind of rude.  Only reason why I even gave 2 stars to this location was due to the the blonde hostess that stepped in to take our whole order, eventhough we can tell she was irritated, whether with us or the server I don't know, but I know she stepped in as soon as she knew we weren't satisfied customers. We also thanked her again on the way out and she apologized to us once again.  And another reason why I gave them two stars was because of another server who was attending to the other tables around us, when our "call server" button was blinking for a second time, she was the only one who helped us after 2 other servers had walked passed.. And she helped me take a charge off of our tab that I screwed up on ( on the table gadget under games don't hit continue to play unlimited games unless you read the bottom first, where it says cancel $1.99 charge lol stupid me)

I've always wanted to check this place out because I've heard such great reviews from everyone I know. So I finally decided to go...   As we walked in I remember saying to myself, man I expected this place to be bigger, but it had a nice cozy feel to it in my opinion and the decor was nice. Never being here before we just kind of stood by the door til someone finally greeted us and took us towards the back, a lonesome 2 top. Lol As much as I can eat I was thinking this table definitely isn't going to be big enough but guess we will see!  I ordered for us, BBQ Beef tongue- pretty delicious for being a tongue off an animal esp with the sea salt and lemon juice they give you. UNI sashimi- super delicious and sweet, melted in my mouth. Big and spicy roll- pretty yum but not my favorite  Baby Lobster and Crab salad- super delicious and pretty decent amount of meat. White Truffle Amberjack- mild flavor, not fishy   And a few other things I can't remember...  Service was nice and friendly, but definitely kind of slow, but I was too busy eating to really notice for the most part.

This is definitely one of my favorite sushi places! I get the same thing every single time I go, & I swear it tastes just as great as it did the first time I went, 4 years ago! I always start off with the tuna poke, then order the double 007 and primo roll and im set!! I don't know what they put in their sauces for their rolls but they are extremely addicting! Only downside is this place is really small, so if you are going in with a large party, I would recommend calling ahead to make sure there is room.. And their servers aren't very attentive, very scattered, unfortunately, especially when busy, eventhough its only like 5 tables and the sushi bar. But over all great place and reasonable price.

I've been going to this gym for about 3 to 4 years now, and I honestly don't have anything to complain about, it's pretty well maintained, night staff is pretty nice, machines are pretty up to date and new and locker rooms are always clean when I'm in there. I'm happy to attend a gym so close to home and well kept.

I've been to this location twice this past month, it is honestly a hit or miss. First time we were sat fairly quickly by the bar and our server was awesome, corrected mistakes and went beyond.  This second time we walked in, three servers were by the bar chatting away, looked over and saw us and didn't come greet us, just continued chatting away while looking around for the host, the host saw us and we finally got sat. Our server came and greeted us and took our orders, but forgot to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked. Our burgers came after watching them sit on the kitchen window getting cold, (couldn't even return them because our server didn't come and check on us and we were starving) then our sweet potato fries didn't come til after we were done with our meal and once again those were cold as well because they were sitting up on the kitchen window. Our server didn't apologize once, or ask if everything was okay and the chipotle aioli and ranch I ordered didn't come til I asked another server for it... Truly disappointed.

Ugh! How I love this little hole in the wall place.. their tamales are all to die for in my opinion! I crave tamales the most around Christmas time but I always get those odd cravings throughout the year, and I love how this place makes their fresh daily! It's like heaven for me, tamales on demand so I don't have to wait til the end of the year to get my fix! But come early so they aren't out of what you want!!

I am definitely a fan of their tuna ahi sandwich and their fontina burger, along with their fried zucchini and garlic fries! Be sure to get there early during the weekends or after the afternoon rush!! Not going to lie I love the farm grill more than Joe's BBQ! Friendly staff, great surrounding neighborhood and atmosphere!

Sushi sushi sushi! All you can eat sushi! Which is one of the ways they offer their sushi here, for under $21 dollars, all you can eat sashimi is a few dollars more though! I know what you're thinking, you can go to an Asian buffet and they have the same... not exactly though! Here you'll get your own rolls made of whatever you choose and they'll send it right out to your table, fresh! Not only can you choose from a large variety of sushi rolls but there's an appetizer section, soup, and entrées! Yes. I did say all you can eat sushi but they also allow all you can eat in other categories too, if you choose the all you can eat sushi option! Isn't that awesome!!?? These rolls and entrées aren't dinky either! Only catch is you have to finish most, if not all of your food before they start sending out the rest.. they don't want food wasted obviously, and I don't believe they'll give you a Togo box either, unless it's towards your last one or something. But either way it's a great deal!   Servers there over the passed few years have gotten better, they're a tad bit more attentive now and less of a language barrier.  Recommendations: Chandler Roll, Scallop dynamite[or seafood dynamite], volcano roll, and their bonzai noodles

I definitely love this park, there's so much to offer, I remember coming here since high school on Friday nights when they would let us look into the telescope and talk to us about certain planets that we could see. Although I'm not too sure if they still offer that during Friday nights. One of my favorite things was to also walk up the little hill at night, up to the gazebo and watch the stars and the moon during fall, the only downside is there are a crap load of mosquitoes and cockroaches at night lol. And now since I have met my boyfriend we definitely take advantage of the lake area since we both fish. Last year you were allowed to take 4 Trout home but they changed it this year to 2, as well as changed the regulations to barbless hooks as well, which is a bummer but I understand why. But if you aren't into astronomy or fishing or stargazing you can definitely hike around the area and just admire all the wildlife, along with taking pictures near the little stream and lake area.

My spouse wanted to surprise me with a perfect night out, so he made reservations for here July 31st at 7pm, little did he know it was going to rain that night lol.  When we arrived we checked in at the host stand and were seated promptly. Our server came over ( I wish I remembered his name) and greeted us and went over the menu and took our drink orders. We told him we were going to order appetizers first then our main course a little later, we wanted to enjoy the night, he was very accommodating and timed everything perfectly!  The infamous popovers had hit the table after the chicken liver pate was served! The pate was quite tasty in my opinion, but my better half didn't care for it much. Now I was ready to try these popovers, I added a little bit of butter to them, first bite was wonderful, then second and third bite started to get a tad bit salty. I thought it might have been the butter so I tried a piece without any... Stil pretty salty.. But overall they were good!  We started off with oysters on the half shell and tuna tartare! Apparently, the tuna was one of the main reasons why he wanted to come to this place, and now I see why, it was excellent and the portion size was bigger than I thought it'd be as well! Bonus! The oysters were delicious as well, but you can't really go wrong with nice cold oysters.  Main course, he ordered the wagyu steak (12oz $92) medium rare with an order of the jalapeno mashed, I ordered the ribeye ($40) medium rare with crab mac and cheese. My boyfriend was so excited about his steak and thought that he would be so in love with it, but he was slightly disappointed. His steak came out more at a medium on one side and medium rare on the other, then on the medium rare side the cut must have been bad because it was pretty grainy and chewy and the medium side was nice and tender and delicious minus it being a tad over cooked for his taste. In my opinion for a $92 dollar cut of meat, I would say it wasn't worth it this time around, but we also didn't want to complain and send such an expensive cut of meat back only for it to be thrown out. My ribeye was delicious eventhough it was more of a medium as well, but that could have been my fault for letting it sit for a bit while I was trying out the mash and the mac and cheese. The jalapeno mash was super yummy, I couldn't stop "taste testing" it lol, and my lobster mac and cheese was pretty good the first bite, but as I ate a bit more it was extremely too salty for me and the bf.  Our server saw the look on my face and came immediately over and asked if anything was wrong, I let him know my side was very salty and wasn't sure if it was me or not and ask if anyone else had said it was salty,he said that was actually the first one he's sold today, so I asked him if he wanted to taste it for himself. He laughed a little and said he would take it off our bill and they could remake a new one for us. I told him that its alright keep it on the bill and I'll just take it home and dilute it with milk, but to just check the rest of the batch to make sure it was just us and wasn't a cooking error.  All together, I really enjoyed our night and our server was absolutely attentive and amazing! I still wish I could remember his name, there aren't very many great servers left in this industry! But I'm sure he knew we loved him since we left him close to a 30% tip :) will definitely be back again!

I just went into this location at 3:40 p.m. to go return an item that I bought at a different location 20 minutes from each other  because this location was closer to my house. I let them know that the Fitbit charge hr that I bought was returned prior to me buying it and whoever bought it stuck a different Fitbit into the the box and there was a bunch of junk on it and ask them if I could leave it here while i go to the electronic department to get a new one to exchange it. And the young gentleman that was helping me, was super nice about it but needed to ask his associate what he can do for me. The older lady told me that she wouldn't exchange it at this location and was rude about it and told me to go back to the original location I got it from, and didn't bother to even help me put the Fitbit back into the box after they're the ones who took it apart. What I don't understand is if all Walmarts are universal and sell the same crap, why did I have to go back to the original location I was at. So now I'm headed to the original location I bought it from and see what they say. Wish me luck!  I wished that Walmart was a little better with checking out their returns.  Yes, I'm pissed off.   ***update*** So I went back to the original location which is the market place location, and told them what had happened. They told me that technically they weren't allowed to return it since the serial numbers didn't match and it was the wrong product but it also wasn't my fault so if that would have happened then I probably would have lost my shit, but they said they will let it slide this time although it was their fault for reshelving an item that shouldn't have been back out to be sold... get your shit together, walmart. Now I know why I normally go to Target.

I was looking for a new nail place to get my pedicures done, that was close to home. Ran into this place by mistake, but definitely love it. The staff is extremely friendly and on a busy Saturday they accommodated me with no appointment within 10 minutes.  The owner is very friendly, outgoing and nice. Her staff was pretty professional and friendly. I will definitely continue coming in.

First time coming here to eat, the line was pretty long, and a huge birthday party was going on as well. Thinking our food would take firever, I was definitely wrong! Not only was my chicken fundido super moist and delicious it came out not even four minutes after we sat down! Then they were having seasonal horchata advertise but we didn't want to buy a whole thing if we ended up not liking the flavors, so we asked the girl who served us our food if we get a sample and she wasn't sure, but asked anyways. As busy as it was we thought she forgot about us because 10 minutes had passed by but then she came over with the samples and the salted caramel horchata was delicious! My boyfriend got two different burritos with shredded beef and it was super tender and juicy I couldn't stop taking it off of his plate lol. For a fast food sit down type chain it was definitely delicious!

I absolutely love this place! I've taken almost every single family member here with me! Before I begin telling you how awesome this place is, I just want to let you know they have Stamp cards here!! Okay, now that I got that out of my system this place basically let's you make up any flavor of ice cream or custard you want and to top that off almost any combo of toppings as well! I'm sure you're thinking well duh most ice cream places are like that, well this one starts at liquid form and by the end of it, liquid nitrogen makes it into a solid right before your eyes!! It's super cool to watch, esp if they freeze gummy bears with it as well, in front of you and watch it shatter to a hundred little pieces, then stick it in your mouth to eat it and it turns all gummy again!  Yes, I'm like a small child at this place.. they also have a science like day every first Friday I believe for children, to show them what else liquid nitrogen can do! Anyways, love this place, staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and I will continue to come here as long as I'm alive lol..  Ps if you don't finish your ice cream and it's all melted,  but you love it so much that you still want to take it home, they can refreeze it for you! Or if you hate your ice cream concoction,  they'll remake you one at no charge!

This last sunday was our second time being here, and boy oh boy, we definitely love this place! When we got here at 10:30 there was a 30 minute wait, which wasnt bad as crowded as it was.. When we were sat our server Heather was pretty quick with getting our order and recommended I add pancakes to my order for 99 cents rather than paying for a full order that I won't finish. Great tip!  I got the New Mexico Skillet with eggs over easy and a side of Oreo S'more chocolate chip pancakes! Can you say I am in Heaven!! It was sooo freaking delicious I want to copy these pancakes and make them every morning!!  My BF got the Santa Fe scrambler (which is weird because he doesn't like chorizo but he loves it here), Taffy Apple Toast and a side of Cinnamon Roll Cakes ( which he says he got for me lol).. And a glass of milk.  All that food came out in less than 15 minutes! We were surprised!  Everything was devoured in minutes!   The best part wasn't just the food, the price for all that food was only around $30!!  We will definitely keep coming here!

I wanted to do brunch with a friend and looked up a place in between us, and this place popped up, so we decided to give it a try. Getting there wasn't too difficult, although the 2 lane road was a bit frustrating, trying to turn into the complex. Checked out the menu, wasn't sure what to get, it was between the country fried steak which my friend got, or the Florentine Benedict. I got the Benedict and it was pretty good, I love that they smothered it in hollandaise sauce, but the down side was my poached egg was cooked all the way through, most places have it runny still. Nonetheless it was yummy and I would recommend this place!

Holy crap! I don't know where to even begin with this place! Staff, let's start with staff, they all look like a bunch of college students who don't really speak english or really care about their customers unless it's their own friends that come in. Luckily I speak Cantonese so I could flag down atleast one of the people that worked there! They aren't very attentive nor do they really care about their customers, it was almost like we were bothering them to do their job. One of the girls spilled the hot milk tea on my boyfriend and our table, didn't apologize, took a good 3 minutes to grab 3 napkins, and just LAYED the napkins over the spill, then walked off. What on earth?! Is that what you do at home?! Speaking of milk tea, it was SUPER watered down and had absolutely no flavor to it.  Now onto the food, half of our party got there 20 minutes before the rest so we ordered the claypot rice ahead of time, then ordered 4 different bowls of noodles, one which had their original fish broth, which no longer tasted like what it used to be.. when the rest of our party came they ordered their noodle bowls and somehow theirs came out before the first groups did.. then we got 2 random wings sent to our table, well that made absolutely no sense, no one ordered it and if it was on the house, why would you give us two when there's 8 plus people there?!? Do we all each take one bite and pass it down?!   We were short utensils and napkins as well, couldn't flag anyone down to get more so we had to go up to the counter and ask, that spilled milk tea wasn't replaced, although I wouldn't have drank or wanted another one anyways, so in conclusion I don't really care for this place unless I were to get it to go. I only gave this place a 2 star because my spouse loved his noodles that he created lol.  I've had better service at a drive thru!

Love this local breakfast joint! The boyfriend and I try to go every other week, he was skeptical with trying this place at first with some of the reviews, but ive gone without him before and love it! Their French toast or any sort is delicious and filling, although i would love more custard over them ;) their sink omelet was great as well.. But i will have to say i am not a big fan of their grandpas skillet ( i believe thats the name of it) too many potatoes, not enough sauce or other ingredients, it seemed rushed and used more potatoes as a filler.. But other than that, manager/owner walks around and says hello and makes sure everything is excellent and is involved, friendly staff, we get the same girl everytime, never introduced herself though so she's nameless, but great place, great food, great location!

I love this place, its like a little gem in Phoenix! I love getting a medium size with taro snoh, red bean, mochi balls and then sesame seed sauce or condensed milk! Amazing combo! The first time i ever went there and had no idea what i was doing, the two Hispanic girls behind the cashier helped me a tremendous amount and was super nice, not making me feel like i was a complete idiot. Lol.. Another great thing is they have stamp cards! So if you're an addict like myself, you'll get a free one atleast once a month! Ps try their Brick Toast! Yummy!

One of my favorite Mexican food places here in Gilbert. I was introduced to this place a few years back after they had reopened by a close friend of mine, and I've been coming here ever since! There staff isn't always on point but for the decently priced menu items and the monthly coupons they actually send out, it's a great place to eat. I love there bean dip and salsa they give you and their chips are delicious as well! One thing I always get here is their seafood burrito,  oh my it's delicious! I highly recommend it, and if you don't finish it, it's tasty the next day too! If you haven't tried this place and want to,  check out the monthly coupon book that gets sent out in the Gilbert area!

BF and I decided to check out a pizza place tonight, it was between here and Flancer's, decide to come here due to Yelp and Google reviews of great food and service. And we all know how I feel about great service... We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday, we're greeted by our server and ordered our drinks then food afterwards. We ordered their homemade fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks along with the 3 V's pizza and added mushrooms onions and red peppers.  Our appetizers came out pretty quick which is excellent!  The batter on the zucchini was pretty awesome, nicely breaded, crunchy, flavorful but still kept thin and well coated. The mozzarella sticks were nice and golden brown and not over done like some places and the cheese stretched nicely to about a foot long lol that's when you know it's good!;] -only issue was we didn't get any appetizer plates, so we had to ask someone.  Our pizza came but our old dishes weren't prebussed so we just hid them under our pizza tray and switched out our plates..   Pizza was beautifully presented, crust was thick enough to hold most of the weight  but thin and crispy just how I like it. First bite was an explosion of flavors, definitely can taste the freshness of the ingredients and that garlic!  Second bite started to get a tad bit salty for my taste but with the veggies we added on it, toned it down a bit. My bf thought the middle was a tad raw and soggy but with all those ingredients and lovely juices, it's expected...  Once we were finished I wanted to try their cannolis and my BF needed a refill on his drink but our server never came back, so we just sat and waited but he didn't show, so we decided to just get the check and leave. Only problem is we couldn't get our check either, so we asked another server walking by if he could grab a box and the check for us... moments later one of the owners came by and chatted with us and apologized, we told her it wasn't THAT big of a deal and we've dealt with worse servers.. she offered us dessert, but we politely declined, it was just nice getting to talk to her and learn more about their business. She hoped to see us again and handed us a gift card, which was a great gesture and wasn't needed in this case, but goes to show how much she cares about her customers and having them enjoy their dining experience. I LOVE SEEING local businesses make it and I really hope theirs do! Oh and the second owner shook our hands and walked us out the door as well, it's the little things that'll keep us coming back again, and of course their delicious food!

I come in atleast once a month, and sit up at the sushi bar in hopes that my favorite sushi chef is working, Summer. My boyfriend and I always get the same rolls, osaka, firedragon (which they don't have at this location unless you ask), mama mia roll and then whatever my boyfriend feels like that day. Don't forget to order their garlic edamame,delicious! Atmosphere is pretty laid back and fun, especially when you hear the birthday song in the teppanyaki room with everyone celebrating. Only downside is they're pretty disorganized still, we will be greeted twice or asked for our order twice, but i guess thats better than not having anyone care for us..  Sushi rolls here are filling and delicious, definitely recommend!

I've been here numerous times since they've been open and each time their food never fails me, but customer service does! I haven't been here in about 6 months now and decided to come in for lunch with my aunt. While pulling up they had a "Now Open" sign.. haven't they been open for almost 2 years now? Am I miss something? As I walk up to the door they have a pretty tacky poster board that says "We're open everyday" that's awesome, when did they change that because I remember coming here several times and they were closed. I finally walk in and there's a sign that says please wait to be seated, so I'm standing there patiently waiting with my infant, staring at the server who's in the back who doesn't even notice me til I literally walk towards the back of their restaurant to go to their bathroom, which was weird and filthy, there's a random table and like some lawn mower looking thing under the table, I think that might be a hazard..  So while talking to our server, I guess they changed owners a few months ago, hopefully their customer service is better than the last and the food stays the same.  Our food comes out, everything is pretty delicious, then they began to get incredibly busy, we needed our check and a few boxes, we literally sat there while watching our server, the only server there handle 14 tables by himself, I felt bad for the kid.. But at the same time we needed our check and some boxes.. it literally took us 20 minutes to even get acknowledged, and we gave him the bill and he sat it down with some lady, randomly at the counter top, where it sat for another 15 minutes until my aunt went up there and asked the lady to run her card. The lady ran the card but charged us too much, we brought it to her attention, she didn't do anything about it and it took forever, so we didn't want to wait again, so we just told her the tip is what she over charged us with and threw in an extra 2 dollars on top of it.. Not sure if our server got the tip out of it, but I have a feeling he'd have a pretty crappy tip day anyways, all of the surrounding tables were complaining and wanting to leave too. I felt bad for him, but they need to manage their restaurant better and give this poor kid a helping hand.. hire some more help and get more organized,  or you guys will lose alot of business!   P.s. Food was still great though!

Came here with one of my girl friends for lunch since it was near her work, never heard of the place, but checked out the menu and looked pretty healthy and appetizing, so I agreed to go. The place it pretty cute and welcoming, in downtown chandler. I decided to get the  chili lime shrimp with quinoa bowl, it was scrumptious! Definitely recommend this place for a healthy inexpensive fast dine in place!

Amazing!! I love this burger joint! Ive tried their breakfast burger, the ringer (minus franks red hot), truffle fries, fried zucchini and their hazelnut milkshake- I think that was the name..  The breakfast burger I ordered medium rare, it was delicious, but only finished half, I ate it the day after and I swear it tasted even better!!  The Ringer, medium rare, was great, but I love my first choice more, although I did devour the whole thing! I also like ot without the hot sauce, I feel like it masks the natural yumminess to the burger.  Milkshake- super rich, creamy, chocolatey, yummy crunchy-ness, if you're a Fererro Rocher fan and/or nutella, this is YOUR GO TO MILKSHAKE!   Double Truffle Fries- they definitely don't skim on the truffle, heavy truffle taste, but thats what i love, so if you're not a die hard truffle lover, this side might be too much for you!   Staff seems friendly, both times I've gone, my servers have always left me with empty water glasses waiting to be filled, a pet peeve of mine, please be more attentive.

Just got done golfing here for my birthday weekend, and being my first time there, it was pretty fun to have to bays side to side and hanging out with my friends and family at the same time. Our server was pretty good for the most part, but she did take a while for a few of the drinks and forgot one, but other than that she was pretty accommodating and helpful. Since we did go during the day and was on the first floor I would definitely like to go back during the night time and on the top floor to see if there's a bit of a fun difference, so that being said definitely going back for sure, and maybe even go to the Scottsdale one and check that one out. Even though I was absolutely terrible at this!  P.s. the bottom floor has a cool little lounge room, with Kinect, 2 big screen TVs, 2 pool tables, and a shuffleboard table along with couches and a few high tops, so that was fun after golfing!

I've been to the cityscape location, love the atmosphere there! But now that the new Shea location is finally open I'm thrilled! My boyfriend and I went in tonight, kind of slow at first , but with the rain, superbowl and just being the 2nd day they've opened, the pace picked up, surprisingly! I ordered the Tsunami roll and the Revolver to drink, my boyfriend ordered the Dirty Rockstar and their Yuzu Lemonade. The kiwi vinaigrette complimented the tsunami roll amazingly, the Revolver was delicious as well, tasted like a fruity Moscow mule, like my server described.. My boyfriend loved how spicy the habanero and jalapenos were on the dirty rockstar, and how fresh the yuzu lemonade was! Service was great as well, super friendly and knowledgeable, we will definitely be coming back regularly!

Before my rant begins I want to make it clear that I love keeping local businesses open and the 4 star should really be maybe a 3.5 solely on food..  It was our anniversary Friday, so the bf decided that we should try somewhere new, his co-worker had told him about this Cajun place that was delicious and asked how I felt about Cajun for dinner. ..  We had a little bit of a hard time finding the place since it is tucked away and if you just look at the map it almost looks as if it's in the same shopping center as Basha's, but it's behind CVS.  We walked in and get seated right away with menu's, we decided on appetizers and our main course 5 to 10 minutes later... but we haven't been greeted yet. Finally our server comes by and drops off some waters and asked if we wanted anything else to drink.. we let her know we were ready to put in appetizers, hush puppies jalapeño style and cajun onion strings please... 15 minutes has gone by and the bf's sprite was gone and water was half emptied and left on the side of the table... where's our server.. there's only 4 tables of couples and 1 larger party who were finished.. Our server finally comes by tells us our apps should be out shortly and asks if we were ready to order our meal.. Gumbo and the Jambalaya please! Our appetizers finally come out 20 minutes later.. bf absolutely loved the hush puppies! But the onion strings on the other hand were shaved wayyyy too thin.. it was all batter, like the onion disintegrated while it was fried.. 10 minutes later our server checked on us, we asked for a box for the remaining hush puppies but not the onions strings, she asked if there was something wrong, we told her, she agreed and that was that.. then I had to ask her to refill our cups since they've been sitting there empty for quite some time now. Patiently waiting for our meal,  I watched as another table after us get their food first,  hmm they must have not gotten appetizers as I thought to myself.. then our server walks up and shows us a blank check book and tells us our order got lost... and asked for us to repeat it.. umm funny thing is I don't believe it got lost, because I don't recall her ever writing it down and what the heck took her so long to realize our order was missing?! As irritated as I was I politely answered her... Our food finally came out 15 to 20 minutes later..   Bf's Gumbo was excellent! Tasty! DELICIOUS! NOW onto my Jambalaya! Yummy as well but a tad spicy for my wimpy butt.. but the chicken chunks in it were perfectly cooked, juicy and tender, definitely fresh and not over cooked at all! I asked for a box so I could save room for beignets, waited a good 10 to 15 minutes before I finally got up and asked for the check and our dessert to be to go... we really didn't want to wait any longer but I also really wanted these beignets... never got the check til I asked a second time.. no bag for our left overs were given either until I asked.. looked at the check and the onion strings were still on which was fine, whatever.. but I had to ask if their onion strings were always that thin she said no and remembered how we disliked it and offered to see if it could be taken off.. Finally 10 minutes later our dessert was brought out, and I guess the owner decided to give us a few extra for me and the little one in my tummy.. thanks that was a nice gesture... ate my beignets on the way home while listening to my bf tell me how that was the worst service compared to all the other crappy servers we get.. but yet the beignets were so amazingly delicious I couldn't stay mad..  So over all our server was super nice and friendly, but just not server material at all, sorry, not sorry.. we were so irritated with the little things that it ruined our dinner and made us just want to get the hell out of there, but then the food was so delicious that it was like a rollercoaster of emotions..  If we decide to eat there again I think we would just do a to go order.. so then we don't have to deal with bad service along with an almost 2 hour dinner time and still tip 20%...  Oh PS their Sausage is amazingly delicious! ;]

Came here with my family to eat and told the our sevrer to just bring all the best items out and don't stop til we said so, hah. We had so many authentic dishes it was unbelievable how flavorful every single dish was! I wasn't disappointed in any of the food that came out, everything tasted extremely fresh and delicious .  You definitely can't go to any other Asian place to get flavors like this, everything tasted like secret handed down recipes! But I do agree with other patrons that there is a slight language barrier, other than that, loved this place!

Came across this place while we were downtown, my boyfriend loves burger places and wanted to check it out, so we did. We both ordered the Bacon BBQ burger, chili cheese fries, a side order of regular and sweet potato fries as well. Our burgers came out before of chili cheese fries which was fine, but with the amount of fries in that bowl, we definitely expected MORE toppings, so that was a fail. Our burgers were too over cooked eventhough we asked for medium rare but I guess burger places just can't make it medium rare anymore, only thing I really loved about the burger was the BBQ sauce, which was on the side, oddly and the onion rings in it. Our side order of fries actually tasted better than the chili cheese one, guess you can't really go wrong with just fries though.  Ultimately we weren't big fans of this place, definitely over priced for what we got.

I was craving fried chicken after I saw one of their commercials last Saturday night and decided why not! I haven't had their chicken since I was probably around 12 years old or so and my boyfriend kept telling me he loved their chicken as well, so we drove over there. I got a little meal deal with a drink, drove through the drive thru. My boyfriend, who was driving was handed my sprite, but the cup was covered in sprite, so he asked the guy if he could wipe it off so the drink holder in the new truck doesn't get all sticky and dirty. He gave us attitude and snatched the soda from my boyfriends hand then handed it back to us(we said thank you, eventhough he was being rude), along with my meal box. I opened up the box with excitement to eat their Cajun fries! I was super disappointed, not only were the fries COLD they were old and stale like... so I went to take a bite of my chicken instead,  but before I did I poked all of them and they were all COLD besides one drum...WTF!? Hasn't this place heard of a heating lamp, or making food fresh or some sort of food rotation?! So with that being said I was super disappointed, and had to heat up my food in the toaster oven when I got home and threw out the fries,  what a waste of time and my money...

Came in today to check out this place and Wow! Atmosphere was very inviting and music was great! Our server was outstanding, he was super attentive, funny and polite. We started off with their calamari and spring rolls, calamari batter was super flaky and crispy but not heavy, just like I like it, I thought the pickled veggies and orange on the plate added some nice color to it, their dipping sauce could have been a tad bit spicier, it was a bit bland since the calamari batter didn't seem to be seasoned either. Spring rolls seemed pretty fresh, possibly house made? They were   yummy! For our main course, we both got Pad Thai, one was Seafood pad thai and the other was Chicken and shrimp then we also got their Chon Thai Seafood Special to go. Both pad thai were delicious, only thing that caught me off gaurd was they use thinner noodles than what I'm use to, but it doesn't really matter or make a difference when it's so delicious, and portion size was perfect! Then when I got home I tried a bite of the special which was Thai hot level, and as much of a wimp I am I didn't find it too spicy, but I'm sure if I kept eating I would have been sweating and crying. lol. The yellow sauce in that dish is packed with some great flavor, I'd definitely recommend it! I hope this place stays in business! LOVE SUPPORTING GREAT LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DELICIOUS!
