We have been coming here for years and the service and quality of food has been declining and getting worse EVERY SINGLE TIME. Other members of my family have already stopped eating here a long time ago, however we still did because it's conveniently located right next to our house. The service has always been bad, rude servers. Ordering for pickup is always such a grueling task.

Decided to check this place out because it was by my daughters doctors office and she requested to get her nails done since she did so well at the doctors. I have a go-to place closer to my home with the best technician, Lily but Yelp had a $40 for $60 deal for this place so I took advantage. Service was mediocre- staff wasn't as friendly and engaging as I'm used to. They definitely rushed my daughter and I and even told me because "they had appointments coming" my total bill was $73 for a gel pedicure and child mani &pedi. My "massage" was more of petting my legs and lasted for about 5mins. After I was done, I immediately put "used" on my Yelp deal. I was driving off and the lady chased me down saying she needed my redemption code. I stopped right away and showed her it was redeemed and cannot be used any longer but she grabbed my phone and brought it in with her and made me wait for her to jot down the code. It was kind of rude. I will not be returning.

Being first time parents, my partner and I never knew how hard it would be to choose a school for our daughter. We did so much research and toured different schools. I knew I wanted my daughter to go to a Montessori since the beginning and we were so lucky to find Adobe. Mrs. Root was so welcoming and definitely gave me peace of mind during our tour. Mrs. Chavez is a wonderful teacher and all the assistants are great as well! Sophia has learned so much and always has something new to teach me every day. I love the "work" the kids do. The curriculum is awesome. Thank you Adobe!

Been coming here with my family since I was a kid and nothing's changed- the food is so good! The service is great also. I love Frank and Simon- the servers. My favorites are the seafood tofu soup, garlic fried chicken, salty fish fried rice, salt and pepper pork and the steamed sea bass! Best Chinese food in the valley.

If I could give this zero stars, I would. The front desk receptionist POSA is a rude person who hates her life. She was trying to explain policies to me but was doing it in the rudest tone possible. They're not understanding at all. The staff is loud and this place doesn't feel like a medical office at all. Very unprofessional and its a dump. They need to shut this location down. DO NOT COME HERE.

I have been to a couple other foot spa massage establishments but this was by far was the best. My sister and I made last minute appointments and the owner was very accommodating and got us in within the hour. I was a little hesitant at first when I saw my therapist was a male because I bruise easily and all the other times I have asked for therapists not to massage too hard, they never do it right. My therapist Allan did it perfectly! He listened to my needs and that made me a very satisfied customer. I will definitely be returning and only going to Allan. Thank you Oriental Foot Spa!

Finally got to try this place and it was such a pleasant experience! I got the chicken & mushroom pie, my bf got the carmelized croissant and my daughter had the mac & cheese. I loved the flavor of my pie! It was so savory and the actual dough was soft and flaky. My daughter enjoyed her mac & cheese and my bf liked his sweet treat as well! The owner was so nice and accommodating! Will definitely be back :)

We decided to sell our first home and was pleasantly surprised to meet Kyle and his team. I shopped around for other companies and Kyle offered me the best price for our home and even let us stay for a couple months to get situated in our new home. He talked us through the process thoroughly and made sure he answered all our questions in a timely manner. The whole process was stress free and very prompt. We were able to close in 2 weeks! Thank you Kyle!

Kate did an amazing job with my full set. I asked for full, dramatic lashes and that's exactly what I got! Kate was so fun and easy to talk to, the 2.5 hours flew because of the awesome conversation. She really took her time and made sure my lashes were exactly how I wanted them. I recommend Kate to anyone that needs a beautiful set of lashes!

Our family just moved and I had to let go of my previous nail salon that I loved because it wasn't as convenient to drive to anymore. Took a chance here based on all the great reviews and even got my fianc√© to get a pedicure as well! I read so many good things about Cindy & Donna and thankfully I was able to get Cindy for my gel manicure and Donna for my pedicure at the same time!!!!! The staff is so welcoming and friendly. My nails turned out beautiful. I will definitely be returning and I think I have found my new holy grail salon! Yay!

With my bf being from Hawaii, he is always on the lookout for new sushi spots- we found Yanagis and needless to say, THIS IS OUR NEW SPOT! The fish was so fresh and everything we ordered was delicious. You have to try the white peach sake also! The owner, Jen was so friendly and accommodating and we found out she was from Hawaii also, which explains her friendly aloha spirit and her knowledge of what GOOD fresh fish is :) thank you Jen! We will definitely be regulars here.
