I've purchased premade guacamole and prepackaged fruits that were both days past their expiration date. I now check every time, and have noticed too much of their products seem to be expired. I've let the cashier know when checking out once and they really didn't seem to care or put any urgency into it. Please be careful shopping here! Would hate to see someone get sick on expired food!

I never write reviews but I am just blown away by the service given to me by Sandra!! I was a brand new customer, and rarely ever would get my eyebrows done. She was really sweet and a perfectionist!! My brows were uneven before she reshaped them and I had to let them grow in more. She also noticed my skin was breaking out bad on my forehead and gave me suggestions!! My second visit, after I let my brows grow, she was able to give them the even shape I've been wanting! And she even brought free samples for me for the breakout on my forehead which I could not get rid of after months and months (I've only been using for 2 days and it's cleared up my face so much!) Sandra is amazing and I'm never going to another person again lol

Food: A+  Service: A+ Cleanliness: A+  I was very impressed with this restaurant!! Small hole in the wall, but authentic and delicious Mexican food and although it was a very long wait (a large to go order was  placed same time as ours) the service was amazing and I appreciate them being upfront on the long wait! Margaritas were good and they had the sports playing on the tv's for the boyfriend, so he was happy. So happy to discover this place, plus just minutes away from my home!
