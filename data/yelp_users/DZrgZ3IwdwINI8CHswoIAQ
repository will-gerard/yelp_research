Great taste! Fresh produce and meat! Serve yourself salad and soup bar. Soup is so simple yet ssooo delish! The food always comes out quick and hot! Most of the servers are very friendly and they are all polite. Great place for lunch as they can get you in and out quickly without compromising quality and freshness. I order the Pad Gra Prow almost everytime. The Pad Thai is tasty and their Drunken Noodle is my boyfriends favorite! I order a Thai Iced Tea every time I go, yum!

The brisket burger, chicken sandwich and pulled pork are all delicious! I'm a total french fry girl but I can't get enough of their house made chips! Their BBQ sauce is so yummy! The staff are all knowledgeable in "beer talk" and super friendly! The beer selection can be hit or miss, especially if you don't like IPA's. I'm not an IPA person (I love dark beer though) and there has been a few times where there hasn't been a beer I particularly enjoyed. If you do enjoy IPA's I think you are in the right place :)

The place looked class and it's close to home and I wanted to really like it. The service was fair enough. Only one waitress and then one of the guys cooking helped folks at the bar. Think they were still figuring out the menu because there was a bit of confusion as to what came with my boyfriends meal. She asked what type of toast he wanted with his breakfast and puzzled he simply replied rye. When our food finally came out all she said was "Your meal doesn't come with toast" to him and was on her way. I believe a quality place would have just brought the one slice of rye and said something like "Actually your meal doesn't normally come with toast but here you go anyway. Enjoy!" I ordered the corned beef hash. Not my favorite. Not even good. Chunks of meat, not shredded, flavorless hunks of potatoes and greasy overall. I'm not a food critic but I LOVE hash! I always finish or take home my hash. This was the first time in a long time that I left food behind at a restaurant. My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito with unmelted cheese and only a sprinkle of beans on top of the burrito. Both these dishes were marked as specialties. I doubt I'll go back but in time if I do I think I'll keep it simple style and order eggs and bacon next time.

So I saw a couple of new signs on the side of the road on my usual route and decided to stop in real quick for lunch takeout. No customers were there and the lady (maybe she was the owner) was happy and welcoming. I ordered and she asked if I would like my salad while I waited as they do not package it to-go. I accepted and it was simple, fresh & had a delish peanut dressing I wanted to lick off the plate... We shared a quick chat. The place is very nice. Clean & modern, a bit dark due to the black walls and ceiling but they have white paper balloons hanging like little moons all over the sky. Nice tables with fresh flowers sitting on them. I will def be coming back to sit down and eat with my boyfriend. The food, which I got to-go, was yummy but a bit spicy and I LOVE spicy!!! I usually get medium to hot but stay away from thai hot. I asked for medium and it was "a drink of water between each bite" spicy! Next time I guess I'll try mild. I ordered the Gapow. Very good but I would have liked more basil flavor, it was very light. The bell peppers & everything were cut to a perfect bite size.  I liked that cause then every bite could have a bit of ALL the goodness rather than a single mouthful of bell pepper or onion or protein at a time. The chicken was tender and not dry at all. I really liked it and I will go back!
