I'm so over this place.  Without fail, it is an unpleasant experience.  The upselling is obnoxious and they a half-assed job.

One of my favorite spots in PHX, I make a trip almost every time I'm in town.  The food selection is limited but good, there's an admirable wine selection but the atmosphere is unlike anything else in PHX.  I highly recommend.

I really dug The Vig.  Love the outdoor patio, complete with lounges and a fireplace.  Had a salad and some wings, both good.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll def be back.

Seriously have to the skills of a defensive lineman to dodge all the up-selling.  Shady!
