It's Wal-Mart - I get it but out of all the Walmart's around me and in my area - this one is AWESOME on keeping cash registers open and available without any nasty lines etc!  Everytime I have been to this store I've been able to get my items - find a line with 2 or fewer folks in it and check out!  That is impressive!

Never ever enough registers open!  You can find everything and then be stuck for 30 minutes waiting to check out.  This time the store has an odor... freezer full of chicken at 50 degrees. ... Apparently no one has noticed to start moving food to date environment.

Good thing it is cheap and easy.   Hot n ready was hot but absolutely not ready!   Nice people but not really communicative.   6 minutes was closer to 15 minutes when done.

Second time in and again I wait for a Ready Now plain ole cheese pizza!   I need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers!

i had the private room booked for a class - I called to confirm a few days before.. they were on it and were polite and friendly.  I arrived the day of my booking and was greeted warmly, walked to the room and they even cleaned all the tables fresh for my class and attendees - as in made sure there was no dust and they were shiny!  Loved my experience !

This is not a busy Denny's... but they have opened up the banquet room for me and my S.E.V.E.N. networking group to meet every week with open arms and hot coffee!  The room is a stand alone with a door and great meeting spot!  We love it!!!   I even use this facility outside of meetings to connect with people!  Free wifi and all the things you need!

After 5 years of being here every Friday with a networking group I am no longer returning and my group of 30 business owners are not either.   New owners are owners who are number people only and do not care about the customers or staff.   The lesson for them will be when they see the numbers are dependant on people. ... The same people they care little for.

Did I wait 45 minutes to talk to someone - yes. BUT - that wait was worth it when all my needs and concerns were absolutely cared for by Anthony Clements with ease!   He was great for communication and being helpful.  He was personable and made the time with him fun and enjoyable and as a result I now have a new phone on Sprint and left t-mobile after years and years of using them.   When you wait... please know .... you are waiting cause they take the time with their clients! I will go back .. ensure I have plenty of time... and know I'm cared for.

In reading the other reviews I was pretty nervous going here. ..but... my experience was perfect and pleasant!   Eye exam on time,  2 pairs of new glasses for the said price,  no pushy upsell... Just given information!   Loved it and will go back!

I have been using Mike EXCLUSIVELY as my mechanic for quite some time and he is one I refer out PROUDLY!   Trustworthy!  Honest!  and truly works for the customer!  He will do what is 'right'.... You will never regret giving Mike the opportunity to care for your car needs!

Davonna took me in on short notice due to headache issues ... she responded promptly to my distress call very early in the morning and I have NEVER been to her prior to this!  This showed me she truly wants to help folks! I arrived... she took me in.... worked my problem area and communicated to me the whole time on her thoughts, findings and continued to assure me she would have me back up to par soon.   I would recommend her to anyone and with huge confidence!

Love when I can come to YELP and see nothing but positive reviews for a great company owned by a great lady!  I have 5 children with furr and I would trust Kelly with them anytime!  Affordable, Capable and Caring would be an amazing summary for this company that surpasses customers expectations!

Great customer service and a great atmosphere.  I booked the private room and arrived at this location to find it was not where I had the room reserved YET I had everyone arriving here!!!   They accommodated and opened up their room with open arms!   They helped me set up and were just awesome!   I'm in for going back !!!

I have used TS Printing Service MANY times and will continue using their services!  Personal, LOCAL, and on it - are the words I'd use to summarize Tim and his crew!   I love supporting local - he ensures he is competitive on pricing as well! I love the personal touch and correspondence in regards to any of my files and needs! Who could ask for more?  I recommend them to all those in my social circles!
