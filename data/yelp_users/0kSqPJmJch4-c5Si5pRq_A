Nice little place to grab some good, well priced sushi. Service is a hit and miss, but seems to have gotten better as of late. So props to the owner if they made some changes.

Totties has great decor, you can tell right when you walk in that whoever owns this place put a lot of heart into it. As good as the decor is, the food and service is just as good. I had the dumplings, and the spicy seafood soup which was suggested by the waitress Chinda. The meal was excellent full of flavor and very large portion, spicy seafood is kind of like a pho on steroids if you will. Chinda was very nice, constantly smiling, and happy to suggest her favorites and answer any questions. I will definitely be coming back!!

Not the best i've had.. The service is not good, the food is so so, and the pricing seems to be a bit high for the quality.

Was in here earlier this month.  Purchased a gun and a nice watch. They were very willing to negotiate and even took a little bit more off because I purchased two things. They were very helpful and friendly with any qurlestions that I had as well.

I'll start off by saying I do believe this place has the best burger in town. The rest of the menu is so so. Nothing to write home about if you know what I mean.
