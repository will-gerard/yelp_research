What the eff is up with the James Bond movies playing at this place? The first time Spouse and I went they were playing Octopussy, I believe, and I thought it was sorta cool. But now that we go on a semi-weekly basis, the James Bond movies always playing just seem bizarro. On our last visit, it was For Your Eyes Only, and it was subtitled in French! Again I ask, WTF? I guess it's some sort of hipster douchebag thing... or maybe owner/councilman Ken Cheuvront is just a Bond fan. Girlfriend needs to get a Netflix membership.  Anyways, I just want a good meal. And a cocktail. And a hot waiter to make googoo eyes at. Fortunately for Cheuvront's, they deliver all three (not literally).  Spouse and I have been so many times, we've had every item on the entree menu (except the Duck because... ewww, gamey). It's pretty limited and super basic; seriously, the items actually read: Lasagna, Chicken, Salmon, etc. But every single one of them is tasty. I typically order the Filet, or I go for the Chicken if I'm feeling cheap. And we always order the goat cheese and chicken Phyllo Packets from the appie menu. Gawd, they are so good I could live on Phyllo Packets alone. I'm pretty sure if they wheeled a barrel of goat cheese to our table, I'd stuff my entire face into it.  Our fave waiter is Jeremiah. He's so dreamy.

I don't know what it is about bike shops that turn people into snobby, elitist douchenozzles. Is it because you're a grown man and your greatest skill is building a 29-inch wheel set?  I own 6 bikes, and I'll be the first to admit that I am mechanically retarded. I can't even clean the chain without knocking the whole damn gearing system out of alignment. So I've been to every bike shop in town. There's one (rhymes with Smandis) that I won't set foot in because the guys who work there will laugh right in your face for requesting minor repairs.  At Slippery Pig, you never know what to expect because you get a different bearded guy each time. Seriously, is facial hair required to work here?  My first experience with the Pig was trying to buy a high-end mountain bike. The owner (King of the Beards?) spent nearly an hour with me describing the models they carried. He convinced me I wanted to buy an Ellsworth Evolution despite that their silly graffiti-style branding makes them look like bikes for skateboarders. Well, I'm not paying $5,000 for a bike without test-riding it first. So I put my name down to take their demo for a spin. In the following weeks, I went back into that shop 3 times and the Ellsworth was never there; at one point, a Beard told me it belonged to the owner and I had to get his permission to ride it. Yeh, dude, I did that. We spent an hour talking.  I ended up buying a Pivot Mach 429 at another store, and I ain't never been happier. Their loss.  But back to the Pig. I also own an old hand-me-down Bianchi road bike that I use for getting around town (two wheels are better than four, people). When the chain seized on me today, I stopped by the Pig on the way home for some help. One of the Beards actually snarled at me, rolled his eyes, and mumbled something about it's not supposed to be set up this way.   Really, because your man with the beard right behind you set it up like this a few weeks ago.

The spouse and I have been going to Ticoz for about two years now, and we still can't get over the ridiculously made-up name "Resto-Bar." I guess "Restaurant & Bar" was too long to fit on the sign. So every time we go, we speak in a thick Transylvanian accent that probably comes out sounding like the Count from Sesame Street... "Lez go to ze Resto-Bar, bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha."  The food has been reliably good... though it seems like the menu hasn't changed since they opened. And it's not too expensive. But more importantly (because we're boozers) they serve fantastic drinks. I could kill an entire pitcher of their sangria. Spouse lives for the Coconut Lime Mojitos. Side-note: the first time we ate there just after they opened, our server lost balance of his tray and dumped several cocktails in our friend's lap. That server doesn't work there anymore... he's now a shirtless bartender at Forbidden (not that I stalked him or anything).  I do love the dimly lit, orange-and-brown ambiance at Ticoz. Look around... you'll notice that EVERY item in the place is from IKEA. (Same goes for sister restaurants Fez and Switch.) It constantly amazes me how contemporary and chic (EDIT: oh jeez, I totally spelled that "sheik" when I first wrote this) they decorate their dining rooms with friggin' IKEA.  Get the guaca-hummus. It rules.

I will never set my pretty little feet in this store again. Too bad for them because the spouse and I are serious runners in need of new Asics every 4-6 months.  We've been three times, always on a Saturday. Every time, they only have 2 folks working. On a Saturday! That's just crappy management. Typically, one of the employees is analyzing a customer's stride on the treadmill. And the other one is running shoe boxes from the back. The last time, we stood at the register to pay for our purchases for nearly 20 minutes before someone finally got to us.  Order from the catalog. Avoid the store like the plague.

We drove by this new place a few times and dismissed it as just another Central Phoenix hole-in-the-wall, mainly due to its cheap plastic sign out front and its stripmall-ish facade at the bottom of Landmark Tower. On a lark, we stopped in one night for dinner, and by the second bite realized we'd found our new favorite spot to eat. I swear we've eaten there twice a week since!  Inside, the decor is quaint, urban and sleek (seriously, it's rare that I rave about a restaurant's bathroom fixtures!). The menu is mostly sandwiches and burgers, but it's damn creative... I doubt Maizie's is the first place to offer "inside-out burgers" with the toppings wrapped inside the meat, but no matter, I was still impressed. The food is nothing short of fantastic. It was all very fresh and large portions too. Finally, the service is warm and friendly. I believe it's mostly family-run, and you can tell by how nice and appreciative they are to their patrons.  My only complaint, and it's so minor, is that their porch is too hot to enjoy ... we've been begging them to install misters. In the meantime, they have installed a brand-spanking new sign out front that's far more representative of this wonderful new eatery.

Dear Maizie's patrons, While the 3 large hi-def televisions strategically placed throughout the establishment and constantly tuned to various athletic competitions may seem to indicate that Maizie's is a sports bar, it is in fact not a sports bar.  So when you yell "FUMBLE!" at the top of your lungs while I am trying to enjoy my Savannah Chicken Salad, I find that to be somewhat of a distraction. Please try to contain yourself.  Sincerely,  Chris B.

The spouse and I went to PastaBAR after seeing it on Yelp, and we were underwhelmed. For starters, the storefront (or what may one day be the storefront?!) is unfinished and facing an ASU parking lot which led us to believe the place was closed. We parked anyways and walked down a hallway past Sens and some out-of-place looking sports bar. When we finally found the entrance to PastaBAR, we still thought it was closed! There was no one greeting customers at the door, and none of the tables by the entrance was seated. Thank gawd we're nosy.  Everything else about the experience seemed like a work in progress too. The dining room was empty... not a good sign for Thursday night. Our appetizer, fried mozzarella, was cold in the middle and sitting in water, which made it mostly inedible. The main entrees were creative, but way too small despite being close to 20-bucks each. Spouse thought his ravioli tasted bland, though I did enjoy my Fettuccini Tagliatta.  Our server was fantastic; he carefully explained the menu and offered recommendations. But I got a big bone to pick with Ms. Thang behind the bar. Both Spouse and I ordered wine (he's red, I'm white). The wine portions were typical, enough to make my cheeks warm, but certainly not enough to make up for mushy mozzarella. Another couple came in after us, and before they were seated they stopped and said hello to the bartendress. They were in the same sorority or something. I watched her pour their wine glasses, and they were about twice the serving as ours! Stupid wine Nazi.  We'd probably go back to PastaBAR. But not for several months until, ya know, they finish building it.

They sell sandwiches. And they have valet.  Let me rephrase for maximum ridiculousness: It is a sandwich shop with valet parking.  I imagine the absurdity of it is lost on Brad and Buffy, who drove all the way from Scottsdale in their yellow H3 for a night out in "downtown" Phoenix. Ohmygaw!  Anyways, the place is packed every night (even Tuesdays) with Brads and Buffys. Good luck getting in.  We finally got a table on a Sunday morning at 11:05 AM. I guess Brad and Buffy had a tennis match at the club. It somewhat pains me to report that the service was impeccable, the decor was mindblowing (that back porch... wow!), and the food was pretty fantastic. I had a delish salad with shredded chicken, and Spouse enjoyed his Valet-style sandwich.  We will definitely go back once Brad and Buffy have moved on to the newest CenPho hotspot (St. Francis perhaps... if that place ever opens). Until then, drive carefully down Camelback. Brad's behind the yellow H3, and he's had one too many Chardonnays.

Pop quiz, kiddies!  What's more dead: Michael Jackson, Paula Abdul's career, or Sanctum nightclub?  Trick question. The answer is: All of the above. (Although I have my doubts about Michael Jackson... did they ever bury that creepy dude?)  I've been to Sanctum three times. You probably didn't even know it was open. Each time, there was less than 10 people in the entire joint.  Wanna know why it's DOA? $8 COVER CHARGE. I don't care how swanky your new nightclub is (and it is suh-wanky), how much money you spent on your state-of-the-art sound system, how good looking your bartenders are, ain't nobody paying 8 bucks to enter an empty nightclub. PS: It's more of an upscale lounge really, the dancefloor is too small for very many folks to dance... but oh, I could stare at that light show for hours.  Call me when there's no longer a cover charge, and I'll change my 2-star review to 5 stars.

Screw you, Hula's. As if Spouse and I aren't alcoholics enough, you have to go and open one of the funnest (that's right, I say funnest) restaurants in Central Phoenix, fill the menu with phenomenal island drinks, and plop the whole thing within stumbling distance of our home. Our livers are on you, buddy.  It takes a lot to impress a professional boozer (that's a lie, but let's move on). That Mai Tai I had last night tasted better than the ones I had in Hawaii. And can I just say how refreshing it is to finally get some fruity options (because I am a huge fruit) rather than the same ol' margarita and martini variations served at every other restaurant in town. Not that I don't live for margaritas and martinis. Let's be honest, I'd drink mouthwash if the bartender poured it in a glass, mixed it with grenadine, and served it to me.  Where was I?  Oh, there's food too. Loved the sweet potato fries. Loved the Hula burger with sauteed onions. Loved, loved, loved Spouse's coconut chicken thingie. I am so ordering that next time because he refused to share. So stingy. BTW, I love that they have a Pupus menu (that's Hawaiian for appetizers) because I am a child (teehee, I said Pupus).  Speaking of next time, we're going back this weekend. Bringing a bunch of friends to hang with on Hula's groovy new patio. And I'm ordering about 17 more Mai Tais. If Hula's could go ahead and place an AA phone number on the drink menu, I'd appreciate it.

"How long is your wait?"  "WHAT?"  "HOW. LONG. IS. YOUR. WAIT?"  "ABOUT 20 MINUTES. Name?"  "WHAT?"  "WHAT. IS. YOUR. NAME?"  "ANITA COCKTAIL. WE'LL BE AT THE BAR."  That was the extent our Grind experience. The music was so frakkin' loud we couldn't even hear the hostess. But we'd read many good things about The Grind (one of Phoenix Magazine's Best New Restaurants... holla!), so Spouse and I were determined to try their burgers.  So far it was not going well. Our first impression was, "Um, are you sure this is it? This a strip mall. And there are motorcycles lined up out front. We are totally gonna get gay bashed here."  For homos, we're pretty brawny (Spouse got guns!). So against our better judgment, we went in anyways. After screaming our names at the hostess, we headed for the bar. Thirty seconds later, we walked out. Above the bar, there are 72 televisions (possibly a slight exaggeration) all tuned to sports. That's far too much testosterone for Date Night, and honey, that lighting is harsh.  The Grind is little more than a sports bar that serves burgers (apparently) and plays music so loud you can't even have a decent conversation. But most offensive of all? They were playing Aerosmith. That'll kill anyone's appetite.
