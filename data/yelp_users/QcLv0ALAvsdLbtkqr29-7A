This is the last straw, I have come back to the AZ Republic on a few occassions, but now they increased my subscription by over 100% for just 4 days of service a week. That's it, and thanks Republic for letting me know about the increase. The only thing I like about the paper is the Sunday coupons and the Friday Fry's Electronics ad.  Other then that the only thing it's good for is my neighbors dog to do his business on it.  The writing is horrible and I have had enough on the a-clown Bickley on the so called Sports page.

Used to come here a lot, and yesterday I picked Red Robin since we haven't been here in a while and it was my Father's Day dinner selection.  The service was absolutely pathetic.  Had to remind my server several times for refills, food that was cold and boxes for our food.  At first I thought we were in for a good meal with a good server at the start, but it turned horribly wrong.  We ordered the large stack of onion rings, got the small stack.  My wife had sweet potato fries that were cold and took forever to get her new fries.  The server wasn't gracious at all, and when the fries did come out he just handed them to my wife with no apologies.  He came to say he would refill our drinks and it took a reminder and 15 minutes before we got them.  At the end of the meal he promised boxes for our leftover food, took him 20 minutes to get our boxes.  He made an excuse of getting food for another table, well that is not our problem.  Saw a person who was cleaning a table with a dirty dish rag, makes me wonder on how clean this establishment is, etc.  Not sure if I will ever return to Red Robin any time soon.   Shame.

Wow this place is great.  Nice open area, but the best part was the staff who were more then happy to help me.  I was very excited to find the books I was looking for, where I couldn't get at several places in the valley.  I will definitely be coming back!

Scott did a fantastic job on the hole in my wall next to my shower.  It looks awesome, and I am extremely happy with the results and his workmanship.  He explained everything on what I needed to do as it dryed, simple instructions and provided me his card for any questions I have.  I highly recommend him.
