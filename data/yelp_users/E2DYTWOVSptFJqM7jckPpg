Over Rated and to crowded.  Go to Mi Patio or La Canasta instead.  Or, go a little further north to Via Delosantos for even better food and drinks!

I have to say I am quite surprised by all the great reviews for this restaurant. And, I also hate leaving negative reviews. That being said, I only tried the chicken teriyaki bowl. The chicken was shaved and was so dry it was hard to swallow. The teriyaki sauce was so watered down it turned my rice into soup. I was very disappointed with the quality of the chicken teriyaki bowl. I don't think they understand that it is possible to completely dry out chicken when over cooked.   I don't think I will be back to try anything else based on this experience.

Good solid mexican food.  Big portions and small prices.  If you order a burrito or chimi get it wet, I made that mistake only once!

Not the best country club I have ever golfed at, but pretty nice all the same.  The course itself is well maintained, though it was aerated recently.  Customer service is obviously touted here and it shows throughout the entire facility.  I had a nice experience and will definitely be back soon.

We've been meaning to try Don Jose's for a while now and finally did today.  We both had combination plates and enjoyed all the different items that came out.  Everything was served piping hot and was very tasty.  They make a "Hot" version of their salsa which was very fresh and spicy, definitely ask for it!  The service here is outstanding!  I never once waited for water; and as I said, the salsa was spicy!  The servers were on top of everything from taking our drink order as soon as we sat down. to ordering as soon as we were ready, to topping off our drinks continuously and often.  The building is funky and reminded me of an Swiss lodge or an old Weinerschnitzel building.  If you are in the mood for solid Mexican food at a great price, check out Don Jose's.

I don't feel like I really need to write a lengthy review here as it has been done hundreds of times.  We all know Carolina's has the best flour tortillas in town, but everytime I order any other food off their menu it is average.  There are many, many much better Mexican restaurants in and around downtown Phx.  So, go in, get your tortillas to go, and head somehwere else for dinner!

I knew right away that this was going to be my daughter's Orthodontist.  Dr. D is an amazing Ortho with the credentials to back it up.  However, his staff really puts them over the top!  These are the friendliest staff members I have ever met in any industry, period!  They even beat the pants off the employees at In 'n' Out, seriously.  Dr. D is the best and even followed up with a personal phone call on the weekend to make sure everything was okay with my daughters apparatus.  He is highly qualified, very passionate and caring, and spends quality time with both parent and patient to make sure they both understand every step of every procedure.  I can not recommend Team Orthodontics enough; and when I told my daughter's school where she was being seen, they also agreed 100% that Team Ortho is by far the best around.  Oh yeah, they also gave me a couple of very generous discounts that others did not offer.  You simply can not beat the friendly service and quality work here, trust me!

Good quality chicken for a teriyaki bowl.  I have not tried the other dishes, but they all look pretty good for fast food Japanese.  Too many places over cook the chicken, but not Neo Tokyo, their chicken is always plump and juicy.  They also have a nice teriyaki sauce and are not stingy with giving out extra!  Good job Neo Tokyo!

My daughter goes here and we absolutely love it.  In-fact, everyone we have talked to who goes here raves about what an amazing school this is.  My daughter and I did a lot of moving and she has been to many schools already in her life.  Horizon is by far the most comprehensive school she has attended.  If you are advanced in a certain area, you will be in a class with older kids who are at your level.  If you need help with a subject, you won't be left behind, you will get mandatory extra help with that subject.  I can't say enough about Horizon, but be forewarned there is a waiting list and I know people who have had their kids on the list for years.  It's worth the wait once you get a child in though.

I love Lebanese food and this is a very good place!  I ordered the Chicken Kebab plate with Tabouli and all was delicious.  The chicken came out in large chunks and was moist and very tasty, seasoned perfectly. It was charred slightly and juicy inside.  The rice was perfect too.  It was cooked to perfection (light and fluffy) and seasoned slightly with Turmeric which was wonderful.  The tabouli was spot on and did not have to much bulgur wheat in it.  It was a huge portion and loaded with all the right ingredients.  The staff here are very friendly and make sure you enjoy your experience and it shows due to the Yelp reviews!  Check them out if your are in the mood for great Lebanese food, or just want to give it a try for the first time, you'll love it!

Giant Burger is a good+ hamburger.  I could never give it 5 stars, as it is a typical diner burger; but, for what it is, it is very good.  When I saw the cook slap the patty down, I automatically thought this was going to be a cheap, frozen, ground beef patty.  Wow, I was definitely wrong.  I asked for the burger to be cooked med-rare, and although quite thin, it came out as ordered.  The meat was definitely not frozen, I could sure taste the freshness of the meat with the fist bite.  Cheese options are limited (american / swiss).  Again, typical diner burger, just better quality.   I recommend trying Giant Burger is you are in the mood for a standard, not fancy, high quality burger.

Great store with a lot of high-end merch.  awesome deli with a huge variety of prepared foods, sandwiches & pizza.  Alos, a sushi bar with excellent quality fish.  I even found steak sauce from Peter Luger's of Brooklyn!  AJ's reminds me of Whole Foods, but nicer and not all about organics.

Very good quality fish here.  The owners were very nice and accommodating.  They offered to special order any type of fish I desired.  They also invited me back the following night for some off the menu sushi another customer had special ordered.  They also offer fresh wasabi which you have to try if you have never had it, you wont go back to the fake green horseradish junk they serve elsewhere.

I wan't sure about this place when we first arrived as it is just off the freeway and shares a parking lot with a Mexican auto / tire shop.  However, when you step inside, this little gem looks like it belongs in Old Town Scottsdale.  I made a mistake and order my old standby, shredded beef tacos.  Don't get me wrong, they were okay, but nothing like my GF's order.  She order the steak fajitas which were amazing!  In fact, these are by far the best fajitas either one of us has ever experienced.  They came with all the usual suspects, however they are of the highest quality.  I want to go back and try more items on the menu, but I am definetly ordering the steak fajitas next time!!!  If you like fajitas, you must try Rita's!

This is a solid sandwich, and when I'm in the area I will swing by again if in the mood for a sub.  I am still on the hung for the amazing bread I miss so much when I lived in Santa Monica at "Bay Cities Italian Deli".  I was hopeful for Romanelli's after reading the reviews, but not even close.  "Ike's For Love Of Sanwiches" is pretty good, but still not the same as "Bay Cities" in Santa Monica.  If anyone knows of a deli with amazing rolls, please let me know!  Romanelli's has good meat and also "Parma" prosciutto, which can be hard to find in many delis.  They have a good selection of meats, cheeses, salads, and hot items.  They have both cold & hot subs available for purchase at pretty good prices.  My sub was $7 and it was huge; like 14".  It fed me twice, and was even better after it sat and soaked up all the flavors for 2 or 3 hours.  Check it out if your in the area and are in the mood for a solid sub!

This is the second time I have eaten her and I am not impressed.  I decided to give it another try thinking it was possibly an off day, or maybe there was a new chef in the kitchen the first time I went.  No, sadly I had the same results.  The chips were good and seemed to be made from hand made tortillas (they were nice and thick with a good crunch).  And the re-fried beans were good.  The rest was very disappointing.  I ordered two shredded beef tacos and at first glance, they looked alright.  But what I bit into was not good at all.  The meat was so mushy, it was like what I could only think of as moist dog food out of a can.  The other plate had a taco and enchilada.  I did not try the enchilada, but was told it was not good either (coming from someone who loves and eats enchiladas all the time).  I know a lot of people love this place, but there is much better Mexican food to be had all over the Valley.

This place deserves 6 stars (seriously)!    Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE breakfast fan.  Always have been, always will be.  Trust me when I tell you this place deserves 6+ stars from the food alone, but it doesn't stop there!    My order:  Red Flannel Hash - if you like beets you have to try this, it is superb.  If you are not a fan of beets (my girlfriend is not and she still loved it) don't worry, there are at least 5 other Hash / Flannel options to choose from and they all sound amazing.  I am coming back every weekend until I try them all and curb my Homemade Corned Beef Hash Fix!!!  GF's order:  Standard Bacon, Egg, Potato combo - Eggs: Cooked to pefection.  Bacon: also cooked to perfection with a very nice smoke to it.  Potatos:  Best I have ever had by far!  BTW, the breads that come with each plate are outstanding (I recommend the olive bread)  At the end of our breakfast I told my date it was the best I had ever had.  She looked shocked to hear that coming from me (critical breakfast guy)!  I know most people are on here to hear about the food.  But I must say the service was also top notch!  The owner was there working up a sweat as he ran around and when he heard us raving about the food, he brought out a french toast plate called "Bananas Foster".  Once again, Best Damn French Toast I Have Ever Eaten!  Side Note:  this place is a little hard to find the first time you visit, but once you find it you won't ever have trouble finding it again!  (It's in the Scottsdale Civic Center)...

The Phoenician is a great resort.  The grounds are immaculate and the staff is excellent.  The restaurants don't live up to the rest of the resort however.  We ate at J&G Steakhouse and it was Average Quality.  Flemings or any other high end chain is better.

I really do enjoy this place everytime I go.  They have a great patio with lots of shade to sit outside and enjoy a cold beer and a meal.  Last time I went, we ordered the Blackened Chicken Nachos (they were pretty tasty, though not the best around by a long shot) and the spinach / avocado dip, which was delicious.    The entrees we ordered were also very good.  Fish & Chips: the fish was excellent and lightly breaded with their signature beer batter.  Chips were also lightly breaded in their batter, but I personally prefer my fries un-breaded.   Burger & Fries:  Black Angus burger cooked to perfection (med-rare) and was very flavorful and juicy.  Again, fries breaded...  Pizza:  I didn't actually try the pizza, but it looked good and smelled delicious.  4 Peaks is always a fun place to stop and at least have a beer or two!

This was my go-to breakfast spot when going to ASU.  That was many years ago, but the quality is just as good today.  Crisp Bacon, Crisp Hash Browns, and cooked to perfection Eggs!  Although, not my absolute favorite breakfast spot (try Orange Table in Scottsdale!), you still can not go wrong with Harlows, but be prepared for a wait.

Still great food, but prices have gone up considerably. Used to be college student friendly pricing. Now the prices are on par with all the other middle eaten restaurants in the Valley. This is sad to me because I frequented this place weekly in college for the great food and even better prices!  Still worth checking out if your in the area and in the mood for good middle east food.

Baseline Sports Bar went through a recent renovation since being featured on the show "Bar Rescue" and has since renamed itself "Brick & Barley".  This is a nice bar and grill with a decent menu and fairly priced drinks.  I had the Reuben and it was done nicely.  The fries were also tasty.  The decor is comfortable with lots of dark woods and brick facade.  There is a pool table and shuffleboard to play.  I will be back for a drink and a bite soon.  Check them out.

This is very good upscale Mexican food.  My only problem is I find it hard to swallow $20 - $30 for a plate of Mexican food.  I know it is very good quality, but I feel for that kind of money I could have a better experience elsewhere.  If the price doesn't bother you, then by all means, it is very good.

I don't eat here enough!  Every time I come to Boa, I have an excellent meal and a great experience.  The chef knows what he is doing and it shows in quality and presentation of the food.  The butter pie reminds me of buttermilk pie I used to get back in Austin, TX.  Definitely worth a try if you are in the area and like Italian food.  Also, good ambiance and nice patio with lots of live plants and a water fountain.

I hate to say it because I am a huge fan of Philly's Famous in Chandler; but, VinciTorio's Cheesesteak Hoagie is better!  Typically I would never order a Cheesesteak Sandwich at a nice Italian Restaurant, but boy am I glad I did today.  I wasn't in the mood for pasta (which they have an "all you can eat" buffet that looked delicious!), so I defaulted to a sandwich.  Now, I'm not saying definitely order the Cheesesteak; but, if you really like them and you are not in the mood for one of their many other fantastic entrees, then give it a try!  Trust me when I tell you, you won't be disappointed.

I have been reading reviews for Pitic for some time now, but have always ended up elsewhere; what a shame!  This place has excellent food and everything is fresh.  The chips and salsa were great!  Chips were fresh out of the fryer and made from handmade tortillas.  The salsas were both very fresh and tasty.  The spicier salsa had just the right amount of kick!  We ordered a combo plate with a taco, tostada and cheese enchilada.  All were wonderful and tasty.  The rice and beans are excellent too (especially the beans!).  Our other order was a carne asada chimichanga, also excellent.  The tortillas they use are wonderful and the chimi was cooked to perfection with a nice outer crust and light crispness on the inside.  The carne asada was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  It is located in an old strip mall that looks like it has seen better days for sure, but don't judge by looks alone!  It is in very close proximity to Carolina's if you are familiar with them.  Give it a try, I bet you will wonder why you didn't sooner like I did!

I love this costco.  They have remote scanners you take with you while you shop and you scan the merchandise you want to buy while you are shopping.  Then when you are done simply hand the scanner to the guy at the express line, pay and go.  Simple and fast remedy to the all to often long lines at Costco.

Is this the best pizza I have ever had,,, no.  Is it the best organic / gluten free pizza,,, YES!  If this place was in LA, there would be a line around the block.  Luckly, this is not the case & there is rarely a wait.  A rare find in AZ and worth every penny.  Oh yeah, snag a coupon on restaurant.com for killer savings!

Good people and good food here at Sal's!    We ordered a Large Supreme Pizza and a Small Dinner Salad.  The salad was not small and it was delicious and had artichoke hearts, yea!  The pizza came out cooked to perfection.  It is easy to get a soggy pie when you order a combo or supreme, but this came out fresh and crispy.  The toppings were all fresh and the cheese seemed to be shredded fresh.  Good Job Sal, we'll be back soon!

Okay, if you like dive bars (I do) and you like a heavy handed bar tender that serves cheap drinks, you will love Kelley's.  This is a dive bar to be sure, and there are always drunk locals sitting around in their usual spots at the bar and getting loud.  But, if you want to run in for a few drinks, you will leave with money left in your pocket and a smile on your face!  If you are in the area and in the mood for some cheap, stiff drinks, check Kelly's out.

I love Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food and Spices is the best I've tried in my area.  I ordered the Chicken Kabob Plate and it was cooked to order as I made several changes to the basic plate.  Everything came out perfect.  The chicken was slightly charred on the outside and hot and juicy in the middle.  The rice was thick and delicious and was colored yellow with what I assume was Turmeric.  If not, I don't care, it was very tasty!  The salad that came with the plate was also delicious, though I would have preferred tabouli.  The Tzatziki was perfect and made with a delicious, creamy greek yogurt.  I did not get the garlic tahini that normally comes with the plate, so I can not comment on that; but, if it is anything like the rest of their food, I'm sure it is also wonderful!  I can't wait to go back and chat up the owner some more while enjoying his excellent Mediterranean Food!

I was looking forward to some good Middle Eastern food when I went to Al-Hana and did not have a good experience.  Maybe the food used to be better, but it was not good when I went.  I ordered the Chicken Shawerma, and it was not good at all.  The chicken was over cooked and cut into little tiny pieces (mistake number one chef).  It was over salted and was not seasoned well at all (lot's of cury).  The rice was very very greasy???  Why would you want your rice to be greasy and your chicken dry?  The pita was fine, but that was out of a bag.  I didn't come here for the ambiance, and this in no way is reflective of my review, as I almost exclusively review on food quality and service standards.  But, there was a guy sitting next to me who kicked off his shoes and sat indian style with the bottoms of his gross dirty feet staring up at me.  When his food arrives he starts ripping apart his chicken legs with his hands and mixing them with his rice and lettuce and whatever else was on his plate.  Then he starts eating with his hands, shoveling the meat and rice mixture in his mouth a handful at a time.  Witnessing this did nothing to help my experience; but again, this is just what I experienced and not a reason for my rating of this restaurant.  I love Middle Eastern food and I hope this establishment can turn it around, as I want everyone to succeed if they work hard at something.  However, currently I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Yes, I have to admit this place is pretty good at what they are doing!    I had the Chicken Greek at $9.50, which is: Chicken breast, spinach, fresh mozzarella, feta, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, artichokes and roasted garlic and tzatziki on the side, yum.  I like to add Sriracha to this particular pasty and they have it on hand!  Their Pasties are cooked to perfection, piping hot and gooey in the middle with a nice and crispy outer crust.  I also really enjoy the decor of this place, it is totally funky and eclectic.  Check out the photos of the interior.   It has been awhile since I have been to Cornish and writing this review makes me think I will have  it again today for lunch!  Cheers!

Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's & Sprouts are my favorite specialty food stores.  What I can't find at Trader's, I can typically find at F&E.  I find F&E is typically more conveniently located throughout the valley too.  I would also say F&E's prices are pretty comparable to Trader Joe's.

Do you like Potstickers?  I mean GIANT Potstickers?  Then you have to check this joint out.  Located in what I call the "Asian Corner" of Chandler (Dobson / Warner) this place serves up the best Potstickers around.  Not only are they the best, they are the Biggest you will ever see.  Usually you think of Potstickers  as an appetizer, right?  Well, not these babies; they are an enormous serving of 8 huge dumplings, pan fried or steamed.  This is a serious meal in itself and I can not finish a plate of these by myself.  Okay, enough about the Potstickers.  All their noodles are handmade and spun in house.  There is a kitchen window so you can watch them work their magic!  Whether you're a Potsticker fan, or just fresh Asian noodle fan, hit them up, you won't be disappointed.

I kept hearing about CityScape and how nice it is.  While it is nice, there is a Serious lack of upscale stores and restaurants.  There is a Bar / Restaurant, and there are many other restaurants in the immediate area, but within CityScape itself there is not much offered.  I like the idea for downtown, it just needs more work at this point.  If you are in the area, I would recommend not eating at CityScape and heading over to Harumi Sushi instead.

If you haven't tried them, they are faster than they say.  I am not kidding, when I order a sandwich to be delivered, it is at my office within 5 minutes!  Give em a try, you won't be disappointed!

Great Food, order off the menu (ask your server for advice).  Apparently they have two different menus, 1 for Americanized Chinese & 1 for authentic Chinese.  I was not advised of the second menu when I went, but my waitress helped me out none the less and I had a very good meal (we did however order the Americanized orange peal chicken and loved it.  lightly breaded and fried no to oily though)

If you like street tacos, these are some of the best in town.  This is a hole in the wall taco joint with a limited menu with a major emphasize on the street taco.  I recommend the asada and al pastor tacos, they are both very flavorful.  I ordered 3 tacos at $2.00 ea. and was completely filled up.  Give them a try if you are in the area (Thomas / 32nd St.)

This is the best teriyaki chicken bowl I have ever eaten, the chicken was so flavorful.  The only problem I have is they wok fry the chicken and I am pretty sure in oil.  While the meal was very tasty, I typically eat this type of food for its low fat count.  Well, this didn't taste low in fat at all, but I could be wrong!  Next time I am in the area, and in the mood for a very tasty teriyaki chicken bowl, you will find me at Yoshi Bento, oh yeah!  FYI, it's right my the Mayo Clinic if you happen to be there and want a good quick meal.

This pizza could be pretty good.  That being said, the sauce is way to sweet.  We're talkin ketchup type sweetness.  I know a lot of people like this type of sauce by the reviews I read, but it doesn't work for me at all.  I much prefer a simple sauce that stands out on its own.  Try Full House Pizza (Kyrene / Chandler) instead.  Their sauce is excellent and cheese grated fresh before it is put on the pie.

Good Chinese.  If you are a whitey like me, ask for it Chinese style and you will get a much better version of what is on the menu!  Obviously, try the many homemade dumplings.

My recommendation,  Head over the overpass to 5 guys.  It's next to Einstein's and is a much better burger.  Or, there is always In'N'Out which is still a better fast food burger.  If you're in the mood for a Really Good burger, head out to Old Town Scottsdale and check out Rehab Burger.

If you want deep dish pizza, this is a solid pie.  The thin crust is not the way to go here.

Best deli sandwich around Ahwatukee.  Bread is a little soft for my taste, but still a good sandwich.  I will go back, but still looking for something in the phoenix area to rival my hometown favorite:  Bay Cities - http://www.yelp.com/biz/bay-cities-italian-deli-and-bakery-santa-monica

I love Jolie's place!  Jolie's has the hardest working bartenders I have ever seen. If they are not pouring drinks, they are busy making sure the bar is spotless.  They aren't light handed pours either.  The food however, is the highlight here.  Just look at all the pictures of the food served here and you will soon realize this more than just a bar, it is a gastropub to be sure.  We have tried most of the food on the menu and have not been disappointed even one time.  Highly recommend the club sandwich and the Stromboli.  Breakfast is great too!  I think they open at 6am.

This is a new location and I only had the breakfast tacos.  When I lived in Austin, TX I ate breakfast tacos a lot.  These were not as good as the tacos I remember, but still decent.  The Barbecue however is very good in Austin and I am sure it is the same here.  I loved the brisket!!!  If you live in or around Chandler, I would definitely check Rudy's out; superior barbecue to anything else in AZ.

Barbecue Time!  Love Sprouts, not as much as Whole Foods or AJ's, but it's right around the corner from my house and the prices are much better than either of the aforementioned purveyors.  It's more like a big Trader Joe's than a Whole Foods.

I had to have a sleep study done as my Primary Care Physician gave me a preliminary diagnosis of sleep apnea and needed this symptom confirmed.  I went and saw the ENT Dr. here and was given a sleep study appointment.  The sleep study was scheduled 1 week from this initial visit and I was not real excited about it at all.  I decided to go with their latest appointment, as I feared I would not be able to sleep, envisioning several doctors standing around in lab coats watching through a window as I lie there.  When I arrived, I was very happy to see the type of room I would be sleeping in during the study!  It was not the sterile hospital type foom I envisioned, rather more of a High End Hotel room with Satellite TV and Internet.  The bed was Very comfortable as well.  They did put electrodes all over my head and chest, but once the technician left, I just watched TV until I was sleepy and dozed off.  The tech came in a few times during the night to make adjustments to the machines, but he was very pleasant and tried to be as quiet as possible.  Let me tell you, I wish I would have done this 20 years ago as I have never felt better.  Oh, also, the machine they gave me is 100% quiet and only has a small tube that goes to my nose.  No more loud "Darth Vader" mask type machines for sleep apnea sufferers, these new quiet machines are portable and almost undetectable unless you told someone you were wearing it.  Do yourself a Huge Favor; if you suffer from sleep apnea, go see ENTICARE, or ask your Primary Care Physician to refer you to them.

Okay, I have been to Pacific Gardens twice now and enjoyed both experiences.  On both visits, it was during lunch so my review is for their lunch service only.  On both visits I ordered from their lunch special menu.  The first visit I had the sashimi lunch special and it was excellent quality.  The portion was very generous and I left stuffed, which is saying a lot when you only ate sashimi.  My dining partner ordered off the Chinese lunch menu and received a huge bowl of Orange Peel Chicken.  I did not try her lunch, but it looked and smelled very good.  On my second excursion, I ordered the lunch special Mongollion Beef.  While it was not as amazing as the quality of the fish, it was still a solid preparation.  Also, the serving size was huge for $5.99.  The Mongollion Beef alone would fill you up, but it also come with rice, choice of soup & salad!  Definitely worth checking out (for lunch at least!).

Backyard Taco, you are nowhere near me, but I'm willing to make the long journey for your delicious Carne Asada!!!  Cooked over real mesquite for a perfect smoky blend of flavors.  The tacos are amazing, but I usually go for the burrito, as it is PACKED with tender, juicy, smoky steak!  In fact, typically, I ask for meat only and hold everything else that comes standard, it's that good on its own.  I guess back in the day, the owners started grilling their food for their family, friends and neighbors; and as word grew, people started following them to stranger's backyards just to get some of the delicious food off the grill.  I don't know if this story is true, but I don't doubt it!  The menu is limited and they obviously stick to what they know best, and it shows.  The restaurant interior is usuall packed with a long line that extends out the door; but don't fear, it usually goes by very quick.  Take the journey if you don't live in the area, you won't be disappointed, I promise!

We went to Matt's on a Wednesday morning and it was packed.  The wait was relatively quick however as they turn people over quickly.  I had basted eggs, hash browns, and bacon with sourdough toast.  All the ingredients were excellent quality and cooked to perfection.  The jams were homemade and there were 2 offered though they only bring strawberry to the table.  I requested the blueberry and they gladly brought some at my request.  Both were excellent, but I preferred the blueberry.  The bread was also homemade and was also great.  All in all, well worth the wait and drive.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of pizza.  Very good dough.  Excellent sausage (some of the best I've had).  And all around high quality, fresh toppings and good sauce.  The decor is a little weird, but nice.  Has an old-school movie theater theme, which is great for kids, but seems like a waste of space and money to me.  Very nice indoor / outdoor bar though.  I say, definitely check it out, it's worth a try if you like pizza.

Very good homemade ice cream in funky little part of town.  When we drove into this area it was hard for me to keep my eyes on the road because there was so much graffiti art on all the buildings.  In fact, the whole block is covered in graffiti and it is something to see.  Melt is tucked away in a little old house that was converted into retail spaces and is very cool.  They serve all homemade ice cream and condiments.  I got the salted caramel ice cream with homemade whipped cream and it was excellent!  There are also other establishments on this (what was once a residential block) street including: vintage clothing shop, coffee shop, a bar, and some more I can't really remember right now.  If you have not been down to Melt you should check it out.  I would go in the colder months so you can sit outside and take in all the atmosphere.

I have a friend who does most of my work on my cars, but when I have something he can not work on, I take my car to Brian at Slaughter.  He is the owner and a very nice, honest mechanic.  They guarantee all their work and are very reasonably priced.  Brian goes out of his way to make sure you are a happy customer.  Highly Recommend for their honest, ethical work.

We ordered wings, queso,  mac n cheese, sloppy Joe and chicken tenders.  Not a very impressive order to be sure, but it still should've lived up to its typical standards.  But, it did not.   While the wings were good and meaty, everything else feel way short.  The sloppy Joe was the consistency of wet dog food and did not taste good.  The Mac n cheese was flavor less ( it's bad when a 4 year old is asking for salt and pepper ).  The fries were battered and greasy.  The chicken tenders and the queso dip were decent though.  The wait staff was excellent; however,  this review is for the food alone.  Step up the quality of the food to match the high prices, and this place would be decent.  Good beer selection.

I have seen a few reviews that people don't like the rolls.  I get that, and that's why I always stick with sushi / hand rolls / sashimi.  If you do the same, you wont go wrong with Harumi, as the quality of the fish is what's important.  The quality of the sushi here is truly amazing!  I have only found 3 really good sushi restaurants in the Phoenix area, and Harumi is right up there at the top.  I ordered a few different hand rolls and each one was very fresh.   I also ordered the Omakase (if you don't know what this is, try it.  It is the chef's choice and I loved all of it).  I will say this, the specialty rolls that I saw come out looked delicious!

Good personal pie you create while standing in line (like a gourmet Subway for pizza's).  Also is fun for the kids to create their own pizza pie!  Not the absolute best pizza around, but definitely worth a try.  I will be going back when in the area.

This is very good Chicago deep dish pizza!  However, unless you live in San Tan Valley or Queen Creek, be ready for a long drive to get there.  I am not saying it is not worth drive though!  If you do live in this area and have not tried Buddy's, I would go tonight!  I would be surprised however, if any pizza lovers in this area have not tried Buddy'z.  I only tried the deep dish which was great, but the thin crusts that kept whizzing by our table looked delicious as well.  We waited about 45 minutes for our deep-dish, so I think we will try the thin crust next time.  If you want an even better deep dish and you are in the Chandler / South Tempe area go to Full House Pizza, it's the best in the Valley by far!

We went here for a wedding on Friday night and it was very nice.  I didn't expect much from The Watershed, as this has been several other unsuccessful restaurants relying simply on the lake views to bring in customers.  Watershed is different; and, although I only had the wedding meal, it was prepared by The Watershed kitchen and was very good.  The bar is great too, it is very large and has some great bar tenders to serve you.  Of course, there is always the large patio in the back that sits above the lake and is very nice to relax and have a meal, or just a drink.  Go and enjoy the sunset over the lake, which is an uncommon experience at a Phoenix restaurant!

I love this pizza and I think the owner is totally cool.  I just wish he had a location closer to me so I could get my Giant Rustic fix more often.    The pizza is GIANT if you order their biggest pie and I recommend you try it!  If you like pepperoni, it is some of the best I have ever had, loaded with flavor.  Not to say all the ingredients here are not wonderful, the pepperoni just shines.  Every topping I have tried here has been fresh and awesome though.  This isn't a fancy "Wood Fired" or "Coal Fired" pie, but it doesn't need to be.  Cooked to perfection every time and delicious!  SW corner of 40th St. & Camelback - Check them out now!

Thank You Full House Pizza!  After an excruciating 1 mile drive home (the amazing smell of the pizza was killing me), I got to dig into my first Full House Pizza.  This is the BEST pizza around and it is run by really cool people.  We ordered the deep dish and it was cooked to perfection (see photos).  Let's keep these guys in business, order from them tonight!!!  If you are in the area, and you like Rosati's, you will love Full House, trust me!  On a side note, don't pay any attention to Nate A.'s review.  It is his only review and who gets sick from pizza anyway, especially for 3 days!?!  I don't think so Nate A.!

This is an excellent sandwich and I have had some of the most amazing sandwiches on the planet on a regular basis (look up Bay Cities Italian Deli in Santa Monica & do yourself a favor, don't miss it if you are ever in the area!).  I have been searching for something to live up to Bay Cities ever since I moved here and all have failed miserably until now.    I totally forgot the name of the sandwich I had, there are a lot of different funky names, it can get overwhelming when you first dine here.  But, it had chicken & avocado and was delicious.  Next time I'm going for the Roast Beef.  The only thing they are missing is Parma Prosciutto.

This Ice Den is great.  There are 2 rinks and the instructors are all nice and very talented. There is a cross fit gym and restaurant / bar to spend time while you are off the ice or just waiting for someone to finish up.  Great for skating lessons or hockey lessons.  They have league hockey as well.

Some of the negative reviews must have been because they were working out the kinks.  Because I just visited Cogburns and had a great time!  The drinks were cold, the food was great (I had the wings) and they came out quick.  The wait staff was very attentive and I never had to wait for a drink order.  By the way, the women that work here are very attractive,  think Tilted Kilt.  They had all the games on and there were televisions wherever you looked, not a bad seat in the house.  I can't wait to go back for football!  If you're in the area,  do yourself a favor and check it out.

Alright,  here we go...  This place deserves 6 stars (seriously)!    Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE breakfast fan.  Always have been, always will be.  Trust me when I tell you this place deserves 6+ stars from the food alone, but it doesn't stop there!    My order:  Red Flannel Hash - if you like beets you have to try this, it is superb.  If you are not a fan of beets (my girlfriend is not and she still loved it) don't worry, there are at least 5 other Hash / Flannel options to choose from and they all sound amazing.  I am coming back every weekend until I try them all and curb my Homemade Corned Beef Hash Fix!!!  GF's order:  Standard Bacon, Egg, Potato combo - Eggs: Cooked to perfection.  Bacon: also cooked to perfection with a very nice smoke to it.  Potatoes:  Best I have ever had by far!  BTW, the breads that come with each plate are outstanding (I recommend the olive bread)  At the end of our breakfast I told my date it was the best I had ever had.  She looked shocked to hear that coming from me (critical breakfast guy)!  I know most people are on here to hear about the food.  But I must say the service was also top notch!  The owner was there working up a sweat as he ran around and when he heard us raving about the food, he brought out a french toast plate called "Bananas Foster".  Once again, Best Damn French Toast I Have Ever Eaten!

I like fired pie, I like the concept and I like the price!  $8.00 for a pizza that can feed 2 always works.  Listen, your not going to be stuffed, but it is enough to feed 2 comfortably.  You start by selecting your sauce base, then move on to the toppings (which they have many to choose from).  Then, into the oven it goes.  The oven is so hot, your pizza is out in about 5 minutes with a nice crisp crust ready to enjoy!

It is always nice to have a good selection of quality burger places around my neck of the woods.  I love burgers and Burger21 didn't disappoint at all.  There are a ton of options and good shakes as well.  They asked if I wanted my burger med-well, at which I said no please, med-rare.  They said no problem and it came out cooked perfectly!  I always appreciate when restaurants accommodate the way you like burgers cooked, as too many places will only cook med+ and dry out their burgers.  For our fries, there was a ton of different dipping sauces to choose from (I forgot to take a picture, but it was a nice option).  I remember the chipotle mayo was preter good.  My daughter of course, liked the plain old ketchup.  I saw a shrimp burger come out which looked better than my beef burger, but I would still recommend the hamburger unless you are apposed to beef!  The atmosphere is typical fast food decor, with a very nice clean dining area.  I will be back for sure and look forward to trying other burger combinations!  Check it out if your in the area, it's in the Whole Foods parking lot Ray Rd / 101

I have been on the search for a good Italian Sub since I moved hear from Santa Monica, CA.  I used to eat at Bay Cities Italian Deli which has the best Italian Sub I have ever eaten.  If you are ever in Santa Monica, don't miss it!  I have tried dozens of sub shops on my quest to find something comparable and nothing has compared.  NY Slicers is the closest I have found.  Get your favorite sub sandwich on their fresh baked baguette, you won't be disappointed.  I so wish they had a location near me!!!  At least they are right off the freeway; I will be back next time I am driving by!

I'm so happy that Espos is back, I love their food!  Although casual and the food comes out on Aluminum Foil Bowls, it stacks up with any other high end Mexican restaurant in the Basin.   I love the El Jefe Burrito, it's even better as a Chimichanga, Enchilada Style!  It is a must try either way if you haven't yet.  As I mentioned this is a casual place, but they have a nice patio out front and the restaurant is actually super clean.  In-fact, it has the nicest bathroom of any casual eatery I have every been to.  On a side note, last time I visited Espos, I noticed they have applied for a liquor license; Yea, Margarita's!  Give them a try, you will love it!

King of Gyros is Legit Greek Grub!!!  I have had several of their plates and sandwiches, all have been outstanding!  I especially like their Chicken dishes; however, if you like lamb, those dishes are delish as well.  Their Tzatzikiis' some of the best I have ever had, and I eat Greek / Mediterranean food a lot.   I live and work very close to this establishment and could eat it daily (yes, I have a problem).  Just like any other good restaurant, it gets quite busy around lunch time, and for food reason.  Great tasting, healthy Mediterranean food done right!  Check them out, you will enjoy it, I promise!

Had lunch here today and was impressed with both the nice people running this restaurant and the cleanliness.  Of course the food was good too!  I had the Chicken Kebab Sandwich which had excellent flavor and tenderness.  The flavors were spot on; however, they do add a lot of feta cheese, which to me overpowered the flavor of tzatziki.  Don't get me wrong, they are doing it right, I would just order Less feta, as a little goes a long way for me.  I will definetely be back to try soem of their plate dinners!  Go check them out: Hayden / McDowell Southeast side

La Pinata has moved and it's for the better!  Their new location is so much nicer than the old location!  Not that I minded the old location, it's just that this new location rocks.  The interior is nice, and they have an even nicer patio to enjoy the last of the remaining temperate days.  The menu is just as good as the old menu; I might have noticed a few changes, but not a lot.  The food is still spot on, just in a more appealing environment.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed!  JM

I am typically not a fan of the Chipotle / Fired Pie style point and select type of food ordering; but, Pita Bistro does it right!  All of their options are high quality well prepared Middle Eastern offerings.  In fact, their tabouli is some of the best around!  The humus is equally impressive (I have only tried the standard version, but they have several varieties available).  I have never had a bad meal here because the quality is a constant!  If you like Middle Eastern food like I do, you should really give these guys a try!
