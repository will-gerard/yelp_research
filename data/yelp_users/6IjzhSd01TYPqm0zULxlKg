I have not lived at Copper Palms but I do work closely with them.  Every time I visit the property, the grounds look great, the parking lot is clean, there's no debris around the pool.  To make matters even better, the staff is amazing.  Everybody in the office always looks professional and acts like true class acts.  I love to visit the community because I know they will always have smiles on their faces and treat me with respect.

I really like this place.  The guys in the office are really friendly and the guys in the shop do their job quickly and efficiently.  I went there yesterday and my boyfriend took his car across the parking lot at the same time.  My service was completed before his and cost less than his for the same exact service.  Needless to say, I won the bet.

Full Circle Auto Wash : 1 Ashley : -2 I've been duped. If I can save anyone else the trouble, frustration and especially TIME, I will.  The common 'low star' comments, confirm to me that I'm not wrong in my feeling of this review.  To preface this review, I am in Outside Sales so I drive a LOT and my car is essentially, my office, so I go to the car wash at least once a week.  I will NEVER return to Full Circle.  I just moved back to this area and I used to go to Full Circle all the time and now that I'm less than a mile from the location, it made sense that I just went back to old habits.  Three weeks ago, I was there and I was laughing because there was an irate customer in there and I thought, what a silly thing to be mad about and when the Manager was going into the lobby area to calm him down, I warned him and snickered with him as I thought it was ridiculous.  Now, going through what I'm sure is a similar experience to that Gentleman, I think he was being kind.    I stopped by Full Circle on Friday because I originally needed to get the oil changed on my car.  I was charmed into purchasing a Two Step Buff & Hand Wash service ($119) and they threw in a complimentary Door Dash & Console cleaning aka DDC ($49).  I was told that for the oil and the detailing it would be a total of $140.  I told the Salesperson that I didn't have a lot of time and that I would pay for the service but would have to come back the following morning for the wash.  I expressed to him that time efficiency is my Number 1 priority.  I was told that I had to pay $119 upfront and I thought pay the remainder when I returned.  My car was then called up from Service and I was told that I owe $49 for the oil change... Well, that's annoying, because I was under the impression that my amount total due was $140.  I paid the man and I begin to realize that I've been taken.   When I pulled up the next morning, I was greeted by a condescending fellow, that I assume, didn't want to give me the time of day because I had already paid and my money was not going to go towards his Sales Goal.  Donovan told me that it would be 8 hours before I got my car back, which is quite a leap from the 2 hours that I was told before, so I said, "fine.  I'll come back on Tuesday."  After I left, I went to fill up my gas tank.  I was flagged down by the Salesperson from before as well as the Manager, Mark.  They said that 8 hours was ridiculous and they were going to honor the quoted 2 hours.  So I pulled back up to drop my car off.. Again.  I was told that I would be phoned when the service was complete and that I should count on pick up around 3pm.  Five hours is still a leap from the 2 hours but better than the 8 hours, I suppose.  When I got the call that the car was ready for pick-up, I did a regular inspection.  I was disappointed to say the least.  The scratches that I was told would be gone were still there and after a conversation with the Detail Tech, I understand why.  I just feel like Customer Service works best when you under promise and over deliver, not vice versa.  In addition, there was white splatter and debris from the wax, that I was able to scratch off so really, I have to wonder when did they hand wax it?  The interior was terrible as the regular finger prints on the radio buttons were still there, a coffee mishap splatter on part of the faux wood was still visible, there was even a water cap left in a cup holder.  At one point, when going over the details with the Tech, I borrowed his cleaning supplies and did it myself.  Ruined that manicure.  He laughed and said, "I hear all the time that our finish line crew is not very good."    When the Manager asked how I felt about the service, I told him my feelings got quite aggressive and went in about how I was upgraded and how I should have paid $50 more.. The way I see it, the car looked better when I used the $20 ViP wash and had it back in 30 minutes, so you really got a $100 tip.  I'm usually very non-confrontational so I accepted this and went home.  On my way out, I was stopped by the friendly Salesperson and he asked if he could take photos on his phone and that he was surprised in the quality as he said that Manager, Mark, was keeping an eye on my car for me and making sure it was done correctly.  He said that he appreciated my frustration and said that he would be upset too and apologized.  On my way home, I got to thinking that this is absurd and the Manager should be held accountable.  I returned to Full Circle (for those counting, 5th time in 24 hours) and I wanted to speak with Manager, Mark.  He was immediately defensive, even more aggressive than before and VERY rude.  Rather than hearing my frustrations he was throwing free car washes to make me go away, when in reality all I wanted him to do was to acknowledge that it was a shady transaction, low quality service and HUGE waste of time and money.  His Management skills are a complete JOKE and his Customer Service is HEINOUS.

As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit.

So thankful that customer service still exists.  They were quick and easy and physically showed me what was wrong so that I didn't feel like I was just paying for something I didn't need, like a lot of shops make me feel.  I will definitely be back.

I used to come here all the time, as I grew up in the area and always stopped in for the free chips and salsa as a teenager.  I moved back to the area and brought my bf and he was pretty skeptical until he was greeted by the host.   The host was amazing, very friendly and welcoming and funny!  We made the mistake in sitting in the cantina though.  That's apparently where all the staff congregates to talk about personal situations and after hearing about how homosexuals lose, a girl went to a friend's house for a "quickie," the bartender thinking he's the fonz of serranos, i almost never want to go back.  The bartender alone was reason enough for this review.  The worst human I've encountered in at least 3 years.  Offensive, tacky, and unprofessional.  From now on, always go through the dining area or your dinner experience will be ruined.

My boyfriend and I just started work in the area and wanted ti meet for lunch and had no idea where to go.  We yelped this place and I'm thankful we did.  The parking is a little different and the location is a bit hidden but it's delicious and not overwhelmingly busy.  The people that work here are friendly and welcoming.  We'll be back!

I went for the first time last week and for as awkward as the situation could have been, MJ made me feel very comfortable with her friendliness, professionalism  and understanding.   I love my new tan amd plan yo go very often.

I personally used to really enjoy this place and my boyfriend is a big supporter of this place but over the past few months I think it's gone down quickly.    One time, we brought my boyfriends boss for a little happy hour action and right before we were able to order, our server informs us that the entire kitchen staff walked out.    The staff tends to stay after work for a drink or two which is totally cool, until it distracts the people that are actually working from their customers.  When the staff is focused though, its great service,  especially the older woman, I don't remember her name but she's petite and blonde and very friendly.    The past two times I've been there, they've been out of what we ordered.   We continue to go bc it is cheap and there are a lot of televisions and it's super convenient to our house but in the same breath, zipps is just the same on the opposite corner. I've been tempted to contact bar rescue on their behalf bc it really used to be a great place w huge potential but it's not living up to it.

We used to love this place and perhaps it was just a bad visit but there was a table two down from us that complained to management.   The food was hard and cold and tasted like we were the last ones to the buffet when there is no buffet there.  Our table was near their computer so we heard a lot of personal conversation but when the manager pretends to fire everyone and asks them why they do what they do in such a tone, it brings down our dining experience mood.  Even with us being so close to where everyone congregated, we left feeling much neglect.   I won't be back for awhile to give them time to go through the people that they need to go.

On such a rainy night, my bf and I thought it'd be nice to watch the Tele and order pizza.  After ordering at 615pm, at 745, we realized just how hungry we were and just how late the pizza was.  Now, I get that it was a rainy night so we gave them a call to check the status and we were told that with the weather conditions, orders have been pushed back to a 2 hr wait.  45 min to 2 hrs?  Thanks for the courtesy call.  30 minutes after that, still no pizza so I called to cancel and they couldn't even find the order... awesome.   So then I ask about the refund and I was transferred to a darling peach of a manager and asked her when I can accept the refund and she responded quickly  with an "I don't know."  Ooook.  Thanks for being oh so helpful.  Then! 25 min after that, the driver shows up with the pizza.  We had already figured out an alternative, so thanks but no thanks. Great customer service and communication, Howie!  Guess who lives down the street, hardly cooks and will never order from hungry howies again?  This hangry elf.

The food and drinks are great!  I love the golden wings and the copper mule is awesome.  I've been there about 5 times because it's such a convenient location for my friends and I to meet at and every time I've had a terrible experience with the staff.  I wouldn't say that myself or even any of my friends are high maintenance but I mean seriously, that staff is either completely unfriendly or way too friendly to the point where she made us all feel uncomfortable (with a really odd laugh).  We end up at Teakwoods, in the same plaza, all the time because we cannot stand the service at Copper Still but yes, the food is good.  I wish there was a drive-thru!
