I have been a costumer of AEO for 10 years now, so here is my review. If you're a up and coming racer they have always been quick and diligent about getting parts or repairing anything needed for my bike. I have recommended a lot of people to AEO and later asked how there experience was, every time has been positive. Everyone at Aeo cares about what they do and love what they do.

I have gone to Banner Health to see Alyssa Hoang a handful of times. My first impression was great, but after that I didn't like the attitude from the staff nor the MD. My last visit I had major shoulder pain and I went in knowing I need to get a MRI done. Once again it felt like I was inconveniencing them. On my way out they were setting up my MRI and they need to ask me some questions. The head nurse told the MA (Rude Tone) "  this patient shouldn't be out of his room." Having said that I told the MA after today I won't be coming here again and I appreciated the MA help. I go to Westview Family Medicine which it a lot further away but that facility is worth it!!

I used desert school for a new truck I bought at the dealer ship. But then later found out the dealer ship went to another bank with out me knowing about. One of the bankers called me to inform me the application wasn't with desert school. The interest rate was 3.2% with the other bank. I went back to the deal ship asked them to switch it to desert schools. Once the paperwork was finalized my interest rate dropped to a 2.79. Thank you desert schools for doing your due diligence.
