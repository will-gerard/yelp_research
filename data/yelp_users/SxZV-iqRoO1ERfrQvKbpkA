This place has really delicious pizza. I had a sausage pizza from here last Sunday along with their angel bread sticks with marinara and I could've engulfed the whole thing. Their Hawaiian pizzas are also great, as are their calzones and lasagna. The owner is nice and friendly and this place is always busy, so overall, don't miss out. A great gem in Phoenix.

I've lived in Phoenix since 2005. This is one of those places I drove by for years and years and years wondering how it stayed in business. It's super basic and has this big Mr. Submarine sign. In fact, it wasn't until 2014 that I finally was just like, "you know, I want a sandwich, let's check it out. I bore of chains easily and I didn't want something from Sub Factory and variety is good." (I talk to myself in lengthy run-on sentences).  But, damn, Mr Submarine has good subs. I LOVE their italian sub. Whether its the 3 kinds of ham they use, how mom and pop it is or their pickles, its the best submarine sandwich I can find in this part of town and I make it a point to grab one whenever I'm nearby now.  So yeah, stop at Mr. Submarine, that sign wore me down eventually.

I love authentic diners. Those little hole in the wall places that have mastered being unassuming and delicious and just concentrate on making great food quickly and aren't another trendy burger franchise trying to emulate that experience.  Chicago Hamburger Co. has that down. Their sliders are a little bigger than I thought they'd be but they're awesome and filling. Their fries are delicious and their milkshakes are just creamy deliciousness. Its tiny but the interior is homey and if you're in the area hit it for a nice meal you'll remember and savor enough to want to write a Yelp review about it,.  They even have a Rahm Emanuel for Mayor poster.

So have you ever watched the television show Hell's Kitchen and seen the episodes where the food service takes 3 hours or so and you're thinking, "Good god, those poor poor people held hostage by incompetent chefs?"  Welcome to my Benihana experience.  We had a reservation on a Friday for 8:30pm for 2. We arrive, get seated promptly at a teppanyaki table with another couple celebrating their 8th wedding anniversary and a foursome celebrating a birthday for one of the girl's in the group. Our waitress comes over, we all place drink orders, lots of Sake. I had drunken whale, a few bottles of Kiran Ichiban are purchased. All of us are here to spend money and have fun.   So at this point it's around 9. Still no chef.  our waitress takes our order. I order the Rocky's choice, filet mignon and chicken. My partner gets the Splash N' Meadows, basically surf and turf. The girl next to us orders Yakisoba noodles and scallops. The waitress starts bringing us the early courses of our meal.  Good onion soup. It disapears quickly.  Good salad, also quickly gone.  More sake is had. We've spent quite a bit on alcohol at this point.  We get a newbie chef Im assuming. Im bummed cuz while weve been waiting Ive seen 3 other teppanyaki shows and services end, so Im thinking maybe there's a snafu and thats why its taking a bit. I try to let it go. My partner goes to the bathroom for a minute the chef comes out and his knife show or what was supposed to be lasts about 10 seconds. She's like I missed it?! Mind you the table next to us, their knife show was about a few minutes long and was really cool. Ours was flip spatula 3 times ok Im in a rush since youve been waiting.  Ok, strike 1. We HAVE been waiting. Don't rush through the fun stuff just to get caught up cuz you were dicking around.  He screws up the onion volcano 3 times. Were cheering him on to get it right but seriously *I* can do this trick. But Im jumping ahead.  It takes him like half an hour to do the rice and veggies. He's clearly in the weeds where he;s cooking one thing at a time even thought there's 7 different orders. He cooks one entire groups steaks before he gets to us, all the while leaving veggies on a plate or the side of the table only mixing them in once we're like ok stop youre gonna go over. He screws up the birthday girl's steak order as well done instead of medium and puts it on her plate anyway then makes her another steak and makes the rest wait. He overcooks the girl next to us scallops til they're singed hockey pucks.  He plants butter on the table and it splashes on my arms and over the girl's chiffon blouse.  It's about 11:00pm now and he's barely finishing the girl's yakisoba.  Yes. ELEVEN PM. The restaurants closed. The cleaning people are there and our food is BARELY getting ready to serve.  My food was ok. I destroyed it because I was starving. But the rice was under seasoned and had some raw veg, the onions were overcooked and greasy. I stopped him on my steak and lucked out that it wasnt overcooked like my chicken was.  The manager then comes over and comps chiffon girl's meal, which means that their order which was close to 500-600 was on the manager. But then only offers me half of after I clearly hear her comp the guests next to us. I was spending about 150, that's chintz, pure and simple.   If youre going to comp half the guests for the same experience, then comp everyone we were all spending a lot of money. I wouldve even come back if that had happened.  So yeah we're offered half off the next group is comped and we still have a dessert course coming. Needless to say, were not going to eat one more course in a closed restaurant when its past 11pm and our reservation was at 8:30pm.  I think what sucked was the rushing through the fun stuff and then he was in the weeds after and overcooking everything for fear of making more mistakes.

On a serious tip, this place has the BEST potato salad I've had in a deli in YEARS. Oh my word, it is super delicious and big chunks of potato, not just gloopy mayo or mustard.  I got their reuben bagel with hot pastrami and sauerkraut and it was a divine revelation of flavor that made my mouth and belly sing. So good. I will crave these for quite some time. AND their pickles are amazing and flavorful -- MUCH MUCH MUCH better than Chompie's.  You want a great deli lunch with bagels, hit this place up.

I love pizza. Period. Cheese sauce and bread. Holy g, in an oven with awesome toppings, who came up with this amazing meal and why aren't they beatified if not a saint. Come on Roma, get on that, we need to know that Italian!  But seriously, Ive been to pizza places all over the country and this is my favorite type - big New York style slices, pipping hot, not too greasy and loaded with a delicious not too sweet sauce. Venezia's is my favorite pizza place in this style in Arizona. Ive been to Pizzeria Bianco and having had to wait the 2 or 3 hours to be seated til I was so hammered from being at Bar Bianco next door I couldnt remember what I ate or how it tasted from being so hungry, I can easily say, Venezia's is where you should go if you want a great filling slice of pizza in the Valley. They also catered an event I promoted with several of their party pizzas and they were delicious. They always have courteous quick servers and I even enjoy their fountain drinks. Not to mention, they always have great specials if you follow them on Twitter. On Tuesdays, you can get a huge slice of pizza and a large drink for under 2 dollars. I cant say enough good things about this place, check them out, theyre amazing.

This is the ONLY real first-run film IMAX theater in Arizona. By real, I mean that it projects films in real IMAX 15/70 format -  not just in IMAX digital on a reformatted screen or mini-IMAX. The sound and picture in this theater are pristine. I saw Sucker Punch here last week and was pleasantly surprised at how its kept up well. There was some schmutz in the projector, so they stopped the previews to clean it, since seeing a 20 foot tall bit of dirt would've been grating for a 2hour film. The staff was friendly and it was a Harkins Theater, so I got the $1 soda via loyalty cup. If you see any special effects or event film in Arizona, go watch it here, it's worth the extra $.

There's not enough good I can sing in terms of praise of Harlow's Cafe. Its a super authentic old school breakfast greasy spoon diner; the Huevos Rancheros are a-may-zing, their toast is awesome, their hash brows are the bomb. They have old photos everywhere and they have waitresses that are very helpful (they dont have male wait staff as far as I can tell, but the girls arent dressed like Hooters - Id say its part of the old time ambience theyre going for). The decor is just really homey and like something you'd see in a movie if you picture breakfast diner. Its not trying to be hip and the food is solid, good and you get a great experience eating there. Its only open for breakfast, but its a good place to grab morning chow if youre in Tempe and there's not a huge line out front and a 2 hour wait like some other breakfast places in Phoenix and the food is easily much better.

I live by here. This is my neighborhood Oregano's and it's the place that has put me off going to Oregano's as a chain. Just a chain of multiple bleah experience coupled with the kicker that made me stop coming here.  Small bad experiences 1) I order the Bollo Pasta. The noodles are literally mush. I ask for one that is less overcooked. This dish the noodles are literally almost a soup. I ask what they can do? They bring me another bowl. Come on. 2 mush bowls and you don't comp or do something better.  2) We had a group of 6 people - they don't seat us because all 6 aren't there. 5 of us are. They tell us to wait in the bar and once the last person in our group shows they'll seat us at a booth. A group of TWO people show up and because they are only 2, they seat them in the booth. Mind you with the 5 of us I said why can't we just be seated and last person can just squeeze in cuz there's room. Nope EVERYONE has to be there. 10 minutes after they seat those 2 people, 2 more people join them. So clearly you LIE to get seating here. Meanwhile we waited almost an hour.  And the final straw.  I order a chicken pizza. I take a bite and immediately notice something hard. It's an inch long chicken bone SLIVER. A BONE SLIVER. If I had swallowed I probably could've died. I tell the server and manager. What do they do? Comp my meal? No.  They offer me a free pizookie.  What. the. Hell. I didn't even order a pizookie. How is that a resolution.  So while Oregano's may want to legalize marinara or whatever b.s. slogan they have. I say Legalize Competency.

AWESOME selection of back issues. This is one of the few shops in the Phoenix Metro area that really caters to the indie comic crowd. Loved that I was able to pick up some classic issues of Vertigo's Shade the Changing Man after they posted about buying a collection on their Facebook page. Drew is a very good dude, I've been coming here since 2006 and its a great place to talk comics and check out a shop that isnt geared to the gaming/Magic crowd like it seems almost every shop in town is. They even have a comic book reading club. Kudos for being different, reminds me a lot of Meltdown Comics in L.A.

This place is a delight. I have been coming here since 2005 and its a hidden little gem in a strip mall on Rural and University next to the FedEx Office. The staff is friendly and always ask me how I'm doing and how work is going. The food is delicious. They do a great lunch buffet every weekday from 11am to 2:30pm - til 3pm on the weekends - and the variety keeps me coming back. The items on the vegetarian portion of the buffet change every day. Yes the buffet is divided by vegetarian and meat options, which make a good place to take those of the non meat persuasion. On any given day, you could try some great spicy vegetable biryani, some delicious lentils or dal, some creamy and savory palak. Or it could be vegetable korma, aloo ghobi, bombay potaties, aloo eggplant, vegetables, pakoras, salad and more.  The meat portions of the buffet always includes the best chicken tikka masala in the Valley (even better at dinner!), yummy tandoori chicken, and a selection of curries, from goat to chicken and lamb vindaloo.  At dinner, the menu is more family style, where you get a large portion of the item and and you can order naan or rice on the side. The menu is more expansive at dinner, includes items like chicken biryani, which is delighful and many more curries and types of aloo. There's a few times Ive made extra rice at home and come just to pick up some tikka to take home and got comped the rice. At lunch, they give you endless naan as well.  Ambiance wise, they recently redid the interior with murals depicting India and its very inviting.  Bottom line, great staff, lovely decor and ambiance. Delicious food at dinner and lunch make this place well worth checking out.

I get an italian sub from here practically every day, they're awesome. So are their southwest chicken salad wraps and their cucumber chicken wraps with caesar dressing. And, the chicken salad croiisant sandwiches, though it seems those were just a test run cuz I only saw them for a week or 2. 5 bucks for one of those, a drink and some chips, a good deal and a quick healthy lunch, nothing wrong with that!

I'm originally from Southern California so I'm a big fan of good hole in the wall Mexican food. The staff here is nice, it helps if you speak Spanish which is another thing I miss about these places being from SoCal, but their pollo asado is awesome. The food is basic, beans, chicken, tortillas and rice is extra. It's good, comfort food and very flavorful.   As a plus, its probably in the best strip mall in Tempe, next to an awesome comic shop, Otto's Pizza and Cartel. Give it a try if youre in the neighborhood.

I was worried when I saw the giant signed poster of Guy Fieri but comforted by the giant life size statue of a Panda as bodhissatva pistolero.  The food here is just awesome. Its a Chinese/ Mexican fusion place. You can get a combo with either refried pinto or black beans and several kinds of rice and Asian and Caribbean chicken flavors plus a snickerdoodle. If you get the combo you can get your food in a quesadilla or burro. On the weekends they have special cookies and black bean tostadas.  I love the food here. Mexican in Phoenix sucks but they got it down, tasty and spicy - plus I LOVE the panda motif. Good food and a good gimmick. Sold!

My long ramen journey is at an end. Hana has the best ramen in Phoenix. Their pork and miso ramens are both easily on par with legit ramen I have had in California. This venue is very hole in the wall, but their sushi is awesome, fresh and amazing. You can bring your own wine as well and the presentation is great. Friendly staff as well add to making this my go to for ramen in the Valley from now on.

I used to come here all the time, but since they've changed locations, it's definitely changed and not so much for the better. My go to barber Timmy left and the ones I've tried since haven't been as good. They used to make a big deal about offering you a beer if you wait and now its almost an afterthought. Plus you ALWAYS need an appointment now or you're looking at a three hour wait.   I had a really bad experience with one of the new hire barbers that they did end up firing I found out later on where he wouldn't finish cutting my hair because he was convinced I had a contagious skin condition that freaked me out so much I went to the hospital to check it out and they said nope this guy was dead wrong and they still made me pay for the cut despite embarassing me publicly and making me leave with half a haircut. I came back and they did apologize but this has colored my experiences here since when before it was like a nice chill old school barber experience it feels like a hipster hair factory where they're trying to get you out of there as soon as possible. Maybe that's not fair, but it does feel that way.  Hopefully, you'll have a better experience, a lot of the barbers are very nice but yeah Im bummed my experience has been colored here.

Stopped in after a few months the other day to get a trim. The place has gone through a lot of positive changes. Friendly new barbers and more relaxed customer service. My hair cut came out great and overall a solid improvement from my last experience here.

I love food, yet I am admittedly not a huge steakhouse guy. So I have not been aware of the growing popularity of Brazilian steakhouses as a "thing." And Fogo de Chao is apparently the apex of the Brazilian steakhouse experience. And so it came to pass that an opportunity came to check out Fogo in Scottsdale (hey, it was either this or Benihana) so we said, what the hey, and pulled the trigger.  So Fogo has a unique structure. They have a salad bar, which - by itself - could be and is a draw. They have a great selection of coldcuts and cheeses, delicious pasta salads. They have a hot food bar with rosemary potatoes, scalloped potatoes, wild rice, black beans and that I could've easily filled up. But no. No, listen to me. Do not fill up on their polenta sticks, plantains, and puffed bread. That's a ruse to keep you from the honeypot.  'The honeypot?' You say, quizzically.  You see, once you're seated at Fogo they give you a card. One side is a red stop sign. The other is go. Sure, without it, they'll bring you some great mashed potatoes at first, but once you flip green. Boom, you are in the danger zone.  Meat will come. From so many people. Meat on a stick. Parmesan pork. Top sirloin. Bottom sirloin. Filet mignon. Bacon wrapped chicken. Even bacon wrapped pork. Plus lamb shanks and more more more!!!  In all seriousness, the cuts of meat are great and varied. From well done to rare and a singular experience that'll make you feel like a king.  The food there is delicious. The experience is pretty epic. Good for a birthday, anniversary, dental graduation. And it beats Benihana.  It is expensive. Between the two of us, after wine, the bill was almost $200 dollars, so not an everyday kind of thing, but good on occasion but definitely felt worth the money.

My favorite barber shop in Phoenix. They take their time giving you a nice old school haircut. I got a high and tight and they took great care on the shave and my beard, at the end you get an after shave rub and a hot towel. Just super great, not too expensive and you leave feeling good about yourself.

This place is kind of the chipotle of Ramen. I mean I think it's weird when I go to the counter and ask if their tonkatsu ramen comes with chashu that they say it can come with anything and you can mix and match the broths. That's ... not right. Real ramen the broth is an integral component of the dish, you can't just mickey mouse it. Most places I've gotten ramen at in California, you know all the components are thought out and at best you can add an egg and that won't wreck it.  So yeah, they'll make any variation of ramen based on what they have. At best, its better than Cup O' Noodles, I suppose. Honestly, the "Republic Ramen" is the only good version and I'm not crazy about soy based ramens, but it's okay.   This place fills a hole since I want ramen, but its like going to Chipotle because you want a burrito. I suppose technically its a burro, but come on, it's not legit. It's good for what it is, but makes me miss real ramen places. And especially real tonkatsu ramen.

This is easily the best dinner buffet in Arizona. Its comparable to a Las Vegas style buffet. I've come here both times on weekend nights and Saturday they do a seafood buffet with king crab. They have a massive dessert bar, with gelato, pastries, cakes. The Italian section will make pizzas and calzones to order. The Saturday I went they were doing New York strip to order - some of the best steaks Ive had, the mashed potatoes are great and their Latin section had the best paella. All in all, solid place to take a group and great place for steak.

Jobot is a pretty cool place. I dig coffee houses for meetings and hanging out with friends because of the laid back vibe. However, I only really drink iced coffee and have never gotten into any kind of hot coffee type drinks, teas, etc. Regardless of that though, Jobot has awesome crepes! With chorizo. They - are - amazing! Like whoa. Also, I always get orange juice here. Its great in a nice big glass with ice in it and I can sit and drink on their nice big patio during the day and its pretty much heaven. They take cash and credit using Square, so I like that I dont have to carry around cash. It has a great local flavor and vibe to it. Aside from having an annoying experience with a chatty homeless person which are kind of epidemic in downtown Phoenix and Tempe, everytime Ive been here has been great. If there's a line, you may have to wait a few minutes since they usually only have one server/cashier but worth checking out since its right off Roosevelt Row next to the Lost Leaf.

The best comic book shop in the Valley, hands down.  The owners and staff are super knowledgeable and friendly. They keep realistic hours for the Valley (i.e. open til late so I can get my books and collectibles after dark and not have to drive in the oppressive summer weather). Their snack bar makes great coffee and slushee drinks. They buy art from local artists to sell in the stores and have tons of events to make the place a social hub, whether its classic wrestling, Doctor Who nights or collectible card games. Plus they have lots of local and celebrated national artists here on a monthly basis with their 2nd Friday nights. All in all a great venue with a rich selection of collectibles. My highest recommendation!

What can you say about The Royale? It's Arizona's equivalent to the Alamo Drafthouse by way of The Cinefamily and New Beverly Cinema. Every week they screen a first-run indepdent feature, everything from Hobo with a Shotgun, to Trollhunter and Conan O'Brien Can't Wait. But by night, they do specialized programming tracks. Everything from Cult Classics, specializing in movies like RoboCop and Army of Darkness, to VHS rarities with Video Dungeon, where old VHS movies are projected digitally with trippy and funny preshows.   The Royale doesn't have a liquor license, so they have a super-expansive soft drink menu, featuring only glass bottled sugar versions of Coca Cola and Pepsi, Dr, Pepper etc. and drinks from all-over like Ramune, Coconut sodas, every energy drink under the sun, Jones Soda and much more. Their concessions have stuff like pokky and yan yan and gourmet cupcakes.  Also of note is their lobby. There is a big art gallery space when you walk up (the place used to be a department store in the 50's so the front has a trippy layout, the art space has a ton of original paintings available for sale including a huge Clockwork Orange and Shining painting. The inner lobby has japanese film fanzines for sale, a mini arcade with games from 70's and 80's including a trippy table-top Pac-Man and tons of framed autographed film posters. The counters have tons of stickers and fliers from every show theyve done, so it has a trippy punk rock vintage vibe to it down to its funky logo.   The seating in the main auditorium is on raised platforms and the seats lean pretty far back which is cool if you want to stretch out but takes a little getting used to. It has a pretty huge screen and the film is projected digitally but its super clear and the sound system is pretty bumping. Its located ina  funky area of Mesa across from a rock concert venue and located between 2 comic book shops. The lobby has a huge old projection TV that constantly plays old movies on VHS - there's some seating around the table top Donkey Kong and a couple rows of movie seats in front of the big TV if you feel like dropping in and just sitting there since you can watch stuff there for free tho the volume on that is kept way low.  Tickets are 8 bucks and way worth a pit stop if you feel like catching an indie movie in the Phoenix area.

There aren't many places at Tempe Marketplace that 1) Have great food 2) Manage to escape the feeling you're at a douchebag convention (Looking at you Cadillac Ranch). Thirsty Lion Pub just opened at Tempe Marketplace right next to Kabuki in the spot Maria Maria used to be in.   Sitting at the bar and looking at the menu at first glance, its a little bit overwhelming - they have everything from sushi to pizza to sandwiches to hamburgers kitchen sinks and lions and bears, oh my. But that's par for the course at brew pub restaurants in the area. I ordered a soda to start and wasn't impressed by how it was instantly flat. My friend was also not taken by how odd and underwhelming their cold water was. I eventually ordered a Green Chiles Chicken Sandwich with guacamole and onions and tomatoes and cheese; my friend ordered a vegetable panini.   Ambience-wise, the music and sports are not overwhelming to conversation. They play the usual generic easy listening rock garbage designed not to offend or impress you'd hear at any sports bar (Nickleback, Spin Doctors, Springsteen). The odd thing here is that the TVs at the bar play videos of the songs and these are big nice TVs and the videos are pixelized and fuzzy as all get out, not looking even close to hi-res and freezing up on occassion. This might be some video/music delivery service issue, but its noticeable and odd. The place is massive and can hold a lot of people and large parties and seems to go on forever.  Our food came out promptly and I was pretty pleased. My sandwich was great and the guacamole was awesome, not overpowering and not bland. It was served on a ciabatta that was a nice consistency, not too soft and not too hard and the chicken was great. My friend also enjoyed her sandwich, although it had aragula and they didnt cut the stems which seems odd. Having once been stabbed in the throat by an errant cilantro stem once upon a time I can say chop those stems in the future.  So, consensus, food was really good, we could chat and it was delivered promptly. Drinks were flat, but servers were nice and courteous.

So this is probably the most expensive buffet I will ever pay for in my life. But it was pretty awesome for a few reasons.  Their paella is awesome. OMG so good, the sausages and cuts of beef are delicious. Their sushi is top notch. The mini lasagnas are great. Their pizza is so-so. I could rack my brains for a while to try and remember just the vast array of world cuisine you can get. They even have good mediterranean food, but was a bit bummed they didn't have an Indian buffet section.  A big reason this is as expensive as it is is definitely the seafood section, they have Alaskan king crab, snow carb, etc. Its all fresh and amazing and you're subsidizing that no doubt. But you will have a moment if youre not used to spending a couple hundred almost for 2 people for one meal where you think, "oh man I could eat at _____ for a 10th of this." Also you'll fill up soon and think man there's just so many choices, if you like one item are you cheating yourself by getting more of it by trying another of it versus a new food item? Needless to say anything that was just meh I didnt finish. But its totally worth it to do it at least once.   There is usually a huge line for this place around dinner. Shoot for early bird. We waited like 20 minutes or so and my feet hurt from walking on the strip. The layout is nothing too special IMO for seating - all the food stations are like continuous in a cafeteria buffet kind of way except for the dessert which is off to itself in the middle. It starts with seafood, then Spanish, meats, American-ish, Mexican, Italian, Med, then Asian cuisines til the end pretty much. They bring you your drinks and its a cool thing to check out if youre staying at Caesar's.

This is the place to go for delicious Neapolitan pizzas. Not Bianco, where you'll wait an hour+ and get hammered at Bar Bianco on Lambrusco to the point where you don't even remember what your fig and prosciutto pie tasted like. Pomo has great ambience, super friendly servers and the owner even brings out some limoncello for you and asks you how your meal is. Their pizza is just as good as Bianco without the wait. Very recommended.

HUGE selection of wine here. Like wow. Especially for a hole in the wall. It doesn't seem overwhelming or ridiculous like if you went to Total Wine or BevMo, just has great ambiance and charm to it.  I got a ham and gruyere sandwich that was awesome. Their pastries and macaroons are also great. Just a nice gem that's well worth checking out.

This is the nicest Whole Foods location in the metro Phoenix area.  They have an excellent bar. GREAT meat department that rivals a butcher shop, even down to smoked meats. I LOVE their asian food bowl section - I come here just to grab dinner on some weekdays, flavorful and rich. Whole Foods exclusively carries Ninja Squirrel sriracha which is my current favorite sriracha style chili sauce, super flavorful. They also do a wok/mongolian barbeque now - which is awesome and they have a great variety of items at their hot food bar, from mac and cheese to Indian food. Check it out, its really great!

The coney dog here is excellent. I love the combination of chili, mustard and onions and their chili is excellent. Their loose meat burgers are also really good and all their french fries are handcut and excellently cooked and seasoned. Even their chili cheese fries are solid. Solid diner stop, A+ all the way and a friendly owner who chats with you.

Its is where you want to go to watch new release movies in Tempe/Phoenix area.  This used to be the Harkins Centerpoint and later it was MADCAP Theaters. Thankfully, they've completely renovated the place. State of the art auditoriums - nice chairs - a WORKING escalator, PLUS glorious A/C!! This is the future!  Comfy recliner seats in every auditorium and a nice chill atmosphere. Its never too crowded here and they have discounted prices now that it is summer and 5 dollars before noon as well. They have an unattended ICEE/soda machine upstairs if you rock the loyalty cups.   Best of all they have reserved seating, so no waiting in line for good seats, you can pick them and choose them online or at the window. Plus its not full of noisy kids and families like Marketplace Harkins is. If you're looking for a good theatrical experience, visit this theater.

I love this place. High end Asian/Latin fusion. When you walk in, they have awesome decor, with a giant picture of a sumo wrestler next to Zapata.  Their Maya rolls are great and flavorful. We made a reservation through Open Table so no wait. We were a bit early so grabbed some drinks at the bar which were also delicious. The fried rice dish was great as were the Korean tacos. Would gladly come back here any day of the week.

Dozo has great chicken gyoza dumplings, that got it off to a great start with me. They also have awesome ramen. Its very much on par with the better ramen in Phoenix like Hana. My go to is the tonkatsu ramen and they totally nail it. I wish they had actual bottles of sriracha though, because if you ask, they give you a little plate with some squeezed in there and being able to season it to make it more spicy would've made my day - they have a great miso based ramen too that I like as well. Their cha shu or pork is super tender and very flavorful.  They also have sushi rolls which are good but the main reason to check it out is the ramen. Stop by its a great date night location.

I dig this place a lot. Handwritten menu on chalkboard walls, lots of board games, good drinks and all the booths have different retro game consoles from Nintendo and Sega. This is what I thought The King would be like. Reminds me of Super Pizza Brothers or what Endgame used to be like. Its nice to see more video game bars popping up in Phoenix and this one is nice and casual atmosphere.

Mill Avenue is awash in sandwich and burger joints. From Ike's to Jimmy John's, Brock Lesnar would have a hard time finding a sandwich sponsor for his fighting jorts. But today I checked out a new spot, Earl of Sandwich. Apparently, its been open for business for about 2 and 1/2 months but they got a fancy new sign that makes it much more noticeable from my PO Box across the street, so I checked it out.  So, first off, their sandwiches are much more reasonably priced than Jimmy John's. They all come hot. The Ham and Swiss was great and a reasonable size, not too small not too big for the price. I ordered a side of potato salad, which was really tasty and a huge serving. I only finished like 4 spoonfuls and more than half was still left. They have a ton of good sandwich flavors, from a chicken avocado to a Thanksgiving sandwich. I'm looking forward to trying more. It looks like an upscale Subway with the Sandwich inventor shirts on the staff, but actually really good. A plus.  If I was Brock Lesnar, they'd definitely have their logo on my butt. Believe that.

I went here with a group of friends and have to admit I had a very wary approach to the idea of stuffed meat. Growing up as a kid I had a few of those Oscar Meyer cheese stuffed franks and that really put me off the idea. But Stufrageous is really different. Very juicy delicious hamburgers and the cheese is greatand the menu is packed full of gourmet options. They have 3 cheese burgers and its all done fresh on the premises. Their french fries are also very flavorful and any restaurant that stocks sriracha as a topping option gets a bonus in my book.  Plus they do have a non stuffed burger that's also awesome and delish if you arent ready for the stuffed burger concept.  In closing, the Oscar Meyer wiener mobile crashed the other day and I have to think its because they knew they couldnt pull off cheese stuffed food anymore. Truth.

I've been looking for a shop with a good old school flavor to it and I really love the Local. It just opened a couple of weeks ago and this may be my new go to. I had Anthony cut my hair and wanted a high and tight and he did a great job. He did the top with scissors at my request and you get a hot towel treatment at the end of your cut and he shaved the back with a straight razor which was really nice. The place has a nice ambiance and Anthony was very friendly and welcoming. You can also get beer or other drinks while you wait, which was an excellent onus. The cut was $25 total and he trimmed and shaped my beard at no additional charge, so I think I'll be coming back here again soon. Thanks again!
