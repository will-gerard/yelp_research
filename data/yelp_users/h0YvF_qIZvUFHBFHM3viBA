Ok so this was my first time going here. I had always seen this place since I've lived in Glendale for so long but I never ventured inside. My total meal cost was about $11 for a two item combo with chow mein and six crab puffs.   Teriyaki chicken - This is more like a sweet soy sauce chicken. The sauce was not very thick at all. The chicken came in huge chunks  Kung pao chicken - Wasn't very good at all. It had a lot of water chestnuts and what looked like very minced up meat. Was not spicy one bit.   Chow mein - Tasted like it has been cooking in a pan that has been used over and over and over again. Lots of carbon or charcoal type taste like if it came off a barbecue grill.   Crab puffs - These barely had any cream cheese or "crab" I couldn't believe how most of the times I would bite into one and there would be barely anything in it at all.   Overall I will definitely not be going back here again it was really sloppy really greasy and didn't come as expected. The only reason why I gave it a two star rating is because the guy on the phone was actually able to comprehend English when taking my order. Great and now my stomach started to hurt!

Worst care care experience I have ever had!  I went into this Jiffy Lube because they said they could get my car in for an oil change in 30 minutes and everywhere else was at least 1.5 hours. I also needed some other services done since I just went over 100k miles so I thought why not do it all here. I went in and was told it would take maybe 1.5 hours to get everything done including transmission flush, engine coolant exchange, rotate tires, replace filters, and oil change. I thought that was great! So I'm walking around killing time in the area and I get a call 30 MINUTES LATER telling me that almost all the work they said they could do they really couldn't. I'm not surprised by this as the assistant manager, Gonzo, seemed to know absolutely nothing about cars. I let him know that I had checked with Toyota already about what I needed for my 100k maintenance and he looked at me as if I had three heads when I mentioned that I needed to replace engine/inverter coolant. I didn't get out of the jiffy lube for almost 2.5 hours! It does not take that long to just do an oil change, filters, and rotate my tires. But wait there's more....  I was asked to step outside to see my vehicle which I thought was routine to kind of show me everything they did. I come out to be told as they were applying "the manufacturer specified pressure" to one of my lugnuts to put the tire back on, that it broke the stud and lugnut. I'm already a little irked at this point its taken so long for just 3 simple services, they couldn't get everything I wanted to accomplish on my day off, AND now you are telling me I have to spend more of my time fixing something you messed up. I was told I would have to go and get it done then come back with the receipt for reimbursement. I was directed to Big O' Tires on 91st ave and Peoria. They were great and took care of it quite quickly. I come back thinking I'd get reimbursement immediately and then I'm told hold on while I call my manager. Gonzo comes back to tell me that it'll be 10 business days before I get a CHECK in the mail for reimbursement. It was pointless at this point to do anything else I just said 'fine', walked out, and tried to get what little bit of my day I had left, back.  I WILL NEVER GO TO ANY JIFFY LUBE EVER! I WILL PROACTIVELY TELL FRIENDS, FAMILY, COWORKERS, AND MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY TO NEVER GO TO JIFFY LUBE. I WILL GO AS FAR AS PAYING FOR THEM TO GET THEIR OIL CHANGED SOMEWHERE ELSE IF THEY EVEN TELL ME THEY ARE CONSIDERING THIS PLACE. I HOPE THIS PLACE SHUTS DOWN BECAUSE IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT WITH LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!

The food was amazing. Very nice and hip but relaxed atmosphere. Really well put together. I think they are either remodeling a part of the building or extending it either way it didn't ruin the experience. I didn't give it a five because other places are a little less expensive for happy hour sushi.

OMG! This was such an amazing turn around experience that was had here. I have ordered before from this Chen & Wok and didn't think it was to great. Can't believe how much this changed my mind!   Total price: $14  Order: Spicy crispy pork, Chow mein, and Crab puffs.   Spicy crispy: So fantastic! Amazing flavor and the perfect amount of heat. The only thing was the meat was more chewy than crunchy.   Chow mein: Wow looks can be deceiving! The noodles didn't look that great but the taste was definitely there. It had like a soy sauce and light teriyaki taste with some possible oil.   Crab puffs: These were really flavorful but didn't taste like a Chinese food crab puff. In addition, there wasn't really much crab on the inside. However, it was stuffed way more than most places and you got 6 for only $4. That's a great price! The breaking was perfectly crisp!   Def go here! It was this good even 30 mins before closing. Now that's dedication!

I got the veggie wrap which should have been called mostly spinach wrap.  It had absolutely no mushroom or other veggies in it. It didn't taste bad just realistically was lettuce and tortilla. It's always so crazy to me how veggie anything cost so much more than meat. I spent 9.45 for the wrap and a drink which wasn't worth it. When the girl came to serve me, she rudely and sarcastically mentioned that I need to put my number on the table ring. IVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE! AND IM THE ONLY NEW CUSTOMER THATS WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR IN 10 MINS! I don't think I'll be coming back
