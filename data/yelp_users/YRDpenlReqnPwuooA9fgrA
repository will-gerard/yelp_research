Food was good as expected, but the experience was ruined when my wife received a text message from the driver about 45 min after the delivery making sexual advances toward her. If he is bold enough to use customers private information in this way, then I can only imagine what else he could be doing. It was completely inappropriate, and I will be following up with management soon. Hopefully they will hold their employees accountable.

Decided to try this place since it is pretty close to home. I got there to find it didn't open till 9. No problem. It's only 15 minutes and there is a Dutch bros next door. 9am rolls around so I go to get my cut and the door is still locked. I see at least 1 employee inside, so I figure she is setting up and will open the door in a minute or so. Well 10 minutes go by and it's still locked up. I decided to leave when I noticed other customers showing up only to be locked out. Bad first impression MUG.

Awesome service.  My fianc√©e broke the screen on her iPhone 6, and Aaron had it fixed within an hour. It was the best experience I've had with a tech to date. He was able to pick up the iPhone from her at work, and complete the job in a timely and efficient manner.  Hopefully nothing goes wrong again, but if it does I'm calling Aaron to handle my business ASAP.
