Richardson's burnt to the ground, but Dick's still erect! Well thank god for that, because Dick's has the best brunch menu in town.  The adovada and tenderloin benedict is so amazing it'll make a straight man say that he loves Dick's. The fresh squeezed OJ and ambiance makes this my favorite brunch spot ever.  Just walking through the doors on a Sunday afternoon is almost enough to cure my hangover.. I love Dick's.

After all the rain this year (and the thought of last years 3 acres worth of weeds on my 1 acre lot)  I decided to save myself the hassle of pulling a million weeds and gave these guys a call.  Much to my surprise they were reasonably priced so I set an appointment.  They were super punctual, very professional, and had more knowledge about weeds than I thought possible.  Even though they wouldn't let me romp their golf-cart around I'm still giving them 5 stars.  I would be in serious weed-hell right now if it weren't for them.  Now I can sit back and laugh at my neighbors and their giant weeds...

Super friendly and knowledgeable staff.  No liquor licence, but they also don't charge a corking fee which is great.  The rolls are average, but their sashimi is excellent.  The yellow tail, toro, golden thai, and the holomokosomethingorother were so good and fresh that it basically melted in the mouth.  The pickled wasabi root that came with the Yellowtail was also quite excellent.   Apparently they get their fish in on Thursday, so if you want it fresh, Thursday is the day to go.  That's when I went and I gotta say Wow!  So good. The bill wasn't exactly cheap, but it isn't every day that you get that fresh of fish in Phoenix that meets that quality. A+  I will definitely be back (on a Thursday)

If you woke up this morning thinking that you wanted to gorge yourself on a giant steak, drink yourself to oblivion, eat loads of cotton candy and ride a mechanical bull, then this place is definitely for you.  I would recommend riding the bull before partaking in said gorging and boozing.  The place has a good sized patio with two fire-pits (where you can roast marshmallows and make smores), three bars, two levels, and a mechanical bull.  The portions are large enough to choke a donkey, so unless you can eat like one I would suggest splitting something with a friend.  The rib-eye was grilled to perfection and the mashed potatoes were delicious.  At $28 though, it should be.  I don't know how it is during the day, but at night the music is terrible and way too loud, but the people watching was definitely good.  I'm giving this place 4 stars just because you can actually roast marshmallows for smores.  That and I really enjoyed watching a prissy (fake everything)  Scottsdale bimbo get bucked off of the bull into a steaming pile of her own vomit.   =D

Really friendly staff, great beer selection, chill atmosphere, and $3 burger and fries on Monday night.  The $3 burger isn't some tiny little squirt of a burger; its a serious gourmet style juicy burger served on a cibatta.   Monday night also has $10 off bottles of wine all night and $3 beers for happy hour.  What more could you ask for?  How about a delicious buffalo cheese dip.  I practically lick the bowl every time I get it. This is the reason I have made Maizies my Monday ritual.

Pizza AND Beer are here atPizza A Metro!!  They just got their liquor license and  I was apparently the first person to order a beer.  I have to say that it went perfectly with my Pizza. I can't really say anything else that the other yelpers have said so I'm keeping this one short. Service was friendly and attentive. The pizza was great. The place was clean. The beer (although the selection was limited to bud light and coors light) was refreshing.  Definitely going back.

Honestly I wasn't all that impressed with this place. Pretty limited menu, the portions are tiny, and they charge for salsa (which was mediocre).  The signs boast the best carne asada in the valley.  Not sure what valley they are talking about, but definitely not the best in phoenix.  Although it was good, I would put it at about average for carne asada.  The location was great and the building was kind of cool, but the seating was very limited and there seemed to be some wasted space.    All in all, I thought the food was okay, but overpriced for what you get.

I heard a lot of hype about this place and so far I have to say that its just that:  hype.  Aesthetically this place is great.  The salon chair bar-stools and beautiful wood are a nice touch. My friend and I went with the margarita to see how they do with the basics.  The flavor of the sauce and cheese were decent and the crust was okay, but the whole middle of the pizza was all soggy and limp. The beer selection was decent though so I'm giving it 2 stars. I believe in 2nd chances, so I will be back to try another pie..

This is a long overdue re-review: I've been back many times and I am happy to say that they have definitely worked out any of the soggy-limp issues.   Parlor has become one of my favorite restaurants in town.  The service has always been good, the pizza rocks, and the pasta is D-Lish!  Try the peperoni with ricotta cheese.  It's my new favorite. Cheers to

When I drove by I thought to myself "Wow, a brand new dentist office.  If its brand new it should be good right?"  Wrong!  This was probably the single worst dental experience I've ever had.  The one good thing was that I got an appointment for the next day.  When I arrived I found the  place to be clean and quiet which was good.  Good quickly turned to bad when the assistant came in to take my x-rays.  First off the plastic things he put in there to take the xrays were waaay too big, sharp, and painful; not to mention the fact that he really didn't seem to know what he was doing and had to re-do the pain several times.  Giving the office the benefit of the doubt, I stayed on for more torture which began with a very rough (and what seemed to be reckless) cleaning which left me with soar gum's and less filings than I started with.  After the cleaning came the real pain.  The dentist came in to do some drilling and fill in a cavity.  I don't know if they were diluting their Novocaine, or just not putting it in the right place, but I felt EVERYTHING.  I had to have them stop several times and more Novocaine barely helped with the pain.  And let me tell you, there was a lot pain induced chair gripping and sweat going on before said procedure was over.  I left that place faster than my feet could possibly take me and I will never go back.
