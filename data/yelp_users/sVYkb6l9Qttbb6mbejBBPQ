Cactus candy is awesome. I always get some when in Phoenix since it is a very unique treat and always is welcome back home. They use the juice of the prickly pear cactus fruit to make a jellied candy which has a great sweet-tart taste. This location is the factory store which makes all the candies sold all over Arizona. It is very bare bones, but you get wholesale pricing and fresh selection. Staff is friendly and helpful, but do not expect a fancy experience. They are surprisingly convenient to the airport which makes it easy to pick up some before the flight home too!

How can you really enjoy an airport? For the most part, you are either waiting to go somewhere or waiting to go home. Most airports just plain suck, but Sky Harbor has always been a step above. They are the hub for US Airways and Southwest, so most people flying those airlines have been through many times, and visitors to Arizona usually pass through these halls.  Terminal 4 is the grand prize winner for the airport. It has extensive public art, new and attractive facilities, and is massive. It can be a chore to transfer between gates, especially if the moving walkways are broken. There are many good food and shopping options, including a wide array of local themes. Most of the best options - including a small, but nice art museum - are outside the security area.  Most gates have a lot of power outlets for a quick recharge, but some of the older areas are a bit worn around the edges. You can also get a good workout walking between gates during a long layover.  The other terminals are very boring, especially those flying United out of Terminal 2. The only interesting part of that area is that the roads briefly make a funky turn so you actually drive on the right like England or Australia. The Rental Car Terminal is far away from the gates, so plan on extra time if renting a car. The new Sky Train option finally connects the terminals to the light rail for more connections.

Nellos is a decent neighborhood pizza joint attempting to recreate a Chicago pizza parlor. This location is rather large and tucked into a strip mall. It has lots of TVs and memorabilia around to add to the flavor.  We had beer, wings, and deep dish pizza - standard fare. The wings seemed really fatty, but the honey hot sauce was really good. I was not impressed with the pizza. I had a deep dish with sausage and meatballs. The dough was good, but the sauce was too sweet and the meats lacked flavor.   Fortunately, the service was great, and the prices were very reasonable. There are probably better options in the area, but it's hard to beat a good neighborhood pizzeria.

This may be one of the best arenas in the NHL. The Gila River Arena was built from the ground up to be a hockey arena, and the views and layout of the place are top notch. Everything is clean and modern with a nice layout. It is the home of the Arizona Coyotes who have been struggling lately on and off the ice, but fortunately the arena experience is still good.  Now that the NHL has adjusted the season to encourage more travel to Arizona, it is much easier for fans to travel to Arizona to escape the snow at home and still see their favorite team play in the desert. Plus - and this is a big plus - they have FREE PARKING. This is unheard of anywhere else. There are also lots of restaurants and bars around the arena for pre and post game activities. Lots of visiting fans also make this a great experience for travelers.  The big downside is the location. The arena is extremely far from downtown and the Tempe/Scottsdale area. Even with the freeways, it may take a long time to drive across town for a game. Concessions are a little weak with only a decent beer and specialty food selection, but all the basics are covered. Plus, they have hockey sweaters from most of the local Arizona school teams hanging on the lower lever concourse which is very cool.  Go Yotes!

Excellent barbecue in Phoenix! Bobby Q is a great place to go for good barbecue in the Valley with authentic meats and extra touches to make everyone happy. They have a funky location off I-17 so you need to exit and drive the frontage road to find the place. Once you arrive, you will not only smell the smoke, but you will enjoy the unique decorations and friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is huge which is good for groups.  The baby back ribs were just amazing. Sweet, smoky goodness falling apart with all the fight long cooked away. They also serve brisket egg rolls, fall apart cornbread, and super cheesy mac and cheese. The Q Rolls were a special treat since the flavor of the meat survives the deep fryer and is a very unique item. The bag of fresh mini doughnuts at the end of the meal is a nice touch and a tasty ride home.  Their location is a little tough if you have to fight traffic on a weeknight, and there is really not much else around. Prices are a bit high, but you are paying for good barbecue. I really like this place and am glad to have it on my trips to Phoenix!

Sorry Brewers fans, this is your home during Spring Training. The park facilities are very nice with good viewing angles and a nice open feel. However, the lines for concessions are unacceptably long. Hire more people or open more portable booths. People will buy more beer and nachos when they do not have to spend 2 innings in line! Even for packed games, there is enough space for more portable carts to help out.  Parking is horrible. I feel sorry for the neighbors who have to tolerate the overflow. Plus, people were jaywalking across 51st all over the place. Cars were backed up far south of the park. There are so many better options for baseball in Phoenix.   Good thing is that tickets are cheap and the overall game feel is great. Just do not count on getting any junk food or beer during the game.

This is the best museum in Arizona, and may be one of the best in the United States. Seriously, this beautifully done museum houses an extensive collection of musical instruments from around the world and across all time. It is nestled in the North Phoenix desert far away from most resorts, but close to the freeways for quick access. The building and landscaping is enough for a visit, but then the music starts.  For a steep admission price, you get access to the expansive exhibits and an audio guide that really opens up the experience. The guide plays the audio of the various video screens in each exhibit. This allows you to hear the instruments being played and really enriches your experience. It is like a long concert walking around the museum, hearing many different expressions of the musical world.  Younger kids will probably get bored easily, unless there are some special kids activities in the museum. The museum is large enough that older kids can have some roaming time without much worry. The onsite cafe is nice too.  This place can easily take most of your day, but your feet will probably give out before your ears. It is a perfect place to escape the summer heat, and the interactive exhibit will allow you to finally act on your urge to touch everything by the end. This place is just amazing, and vacations should be built around it.

I have been waiting a long time to finally try Pizzeria Bianco. This review is for the Town & Country location rather than the downtown location. The restaurant is big and open with indoor and outdoor seating. It has a larger menu than the downtown location, but we were here for the pizza.  We had the Wiseguy and Rosa pizzas. The pizzas are rather large and have a great thin crust. Both of us agreed that the Rosa had a lot of flavor with the pistachios, cheese, and oil. The Wiseguy was rather bland, even with the sausage and smoked onions. The onions would be great on another pizza though. Both did not have a tomato sauce, but it was not missed. You can save the crusts to sop up all the olive oil remaining on the plate too.  This place deserves most of the hype, although I would not wait in a long line for it. The other location probably has more atmosphere, but this location is a great way to get the food without the fuss.

This location will probably be closed when you read this, but this place is still amazing no matter where it is located. The food is the absolute star with fantastic meats and the best fry bread anywhere. I was dreaming of their food before coming to Phoenix and am always tempted to fly down just for lunch! Hopefully the new location will be worthy of the food!
