As I sit in this airport, I'd like to share my experience while I wait 3.5 hours for my delayed flight to depart.  YOU ARE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE IF YOU CONTEMPLATE FLYING WITH ALLEGIANT. You will fall victim to false affordable prices. My listed price of $75 round trip was escalated to $150 after all their additional charges (carry on luggage, reserving ANY seats...). We paid additional fees to get on the 5pm flight, and this incompetent airline just let the 7pm Vegas flight leave before us.   This airline stresses all over that you need to arrive exaggerated time before your flight, and so I took of work with my only vacation time this year to drive 50 min to the airport in the middle of nowhere. At 5pm there was NO staff to be found in their one terminal or to explain why the flight has not boarded. That is because ALLEGIANT doesn't have any staff here,  just the oblivous and rude airport staff here to deal with their customers.  We saw an allegiant manager for 5 min who cowered in front of an angry mob, and offered no apologies or compensation. He has now retreated back to sad cave and I doubt we will ever see this unqualified loser again.   I'm currently surrounded by passengers that have been waiting for a different 4:10 flight to leave, and it is currently 6:45. Everyone in this poorly air conditioned terminal is on their phone having to cancel/reschedule their plans because of this airline and airports inability to execute the few flights they have daily.  I fly all the time for work and liesure; never had a worse experience. They do not have their act together, and If my return flight is anywhere near this awful...   F U ALLEGIANT and this airport  PS: this airline will stress you beyond measure, and not allow you to smoke a f-ing cigarette anywhere!

My dog Murph Man has been coming here for years. The staff are all dog lovers and I love the picture updates they send throughout the day. Murphy always comes home tired from playing with the other dogs and the walks they take him on throughout the day. I would recommend DS to any Scottsdale dog owner!
