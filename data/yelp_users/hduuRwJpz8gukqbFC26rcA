Why do I always feel bloated when I leave...I must always eat way too much.  La Tolteca is very good, authentic Phoenix-style Mexican Food.  The corn and flour tortillas are great, as is the green tomatillo/avocado sauce.  The meats / fish are tender and marinates are tasty.  The portions are to huge (if there is one item to complain about).  Awesome bakery too...especially the tres' leche cake.

I think I'm addicted.  It's got three awesome attributes: it's authentic, it's good, and it's cheap.  99 cent street tacos and the 2.99 gordito are amazing.  It looks like a greasy spoon outside, but inside this small joint is clean and friendly.   I've now gone back 4 times in the past 4 weeks.

LGO is one of my favs.  Amazing flavor whether ording pizza or any of their sandwhiches (like tuna filet) or salads.  Pizzas (available with both smokey chewy flour or glueten free crusts) are to die for...Mother Earth Vegan and Rocketman are my two favorites (both vegetarian).  English Muffins are really the best of anywhere...I never knew how good a soft, freshly backed muffin could be, as it just melts your pallet.    The only negative: parking is horrible (mainly since the place is so popular)...so use the free valet or go at mid-times.   Nontheless, the food and atmosphere more than make amends.

Good food, great service.  For the GF'ers out there, they many options--the food-servers can request most items to be gluten free.  Not much variety for strict vegetarians, though.  Atmosphere is classy and friendly, but noisy.  The  pork dish my wife had was very good, the lobster that I had was a bit overcooked and the risotto was a bit crunchy.  Would definitely go back--the salad was incredible,

Great tacos and salsa.  Carnitas, pescado, and goat...and good salsa and roasted jalape√±os.

Atmosphere was funky.  We went last week, with two gift certificates from Sunflower Markets.  When our server finally came with extra sighs and huffs of over-work blithering. Before greating us looked at the gift certificates sitting on the table and said 'you can't use those both here'--it's the rules of the owners.  So I asked are we allowed to split checks at a table--'no'.  We can't really comment on the food...the staffer was so rude about it, that we actually walked out.  (We have tried the location at PV Mall...we had a great experience with the atmosphere and server...food was okay: salad-good, GF pizza-below average.)

Consistent.  Fresh Mint offers a very consistent product.   This is a vegetarian restaurant with a Kosher designationl. The menu is Asian, with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies.  The tofu is flavored/shaped as with it's more traditional dish (i.e. Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu, Beef dishes taste more like beef).  Personally, I prefer plain tofu over flavored and they will substitute to your taste.  Also, for GF'ers, they do have some dishes that are GF (no soy sauce--such as curries).  No upcharges for any subs or even brown rice...  At lunch, hardly a seat is available. It's nice to see that this is more crowded than the fast food joint that is closer to the street.  A slight tention can be felt for the business of the staff; however, this restaurant is consistant every time...it's worth trying folks.

If you have dietary restrictions or are insanely health-conscious (like me), YOU MUST TRY NOURISH.  This is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons.   First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.  The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.  p.s.  Thanks for the tour.

With three months of Gluten-Free life under our belts, we have found that most GF substitutes are hardly palatable.  GF Bakery has some great creations.  The Red Velvet Cake is awesome (and not dry).  The breads are so much better than the varieties found in with the big-box grocers.

Great food, comfortable atmosphere.  Been back several times...the Vegan Nosh and veggie tacos are awesome.  Their number one dish is the Butternut Squash Enchilada...very good , but a little dry.  And, the specialty drinks are yummy--try the elderberry margherita.  The setting (at Southbridge in Old Town Scottsdale) is trendy, yet casual...the service is always fantastic.  (p.s.  The menu offers a variety of gluten free dishes).
