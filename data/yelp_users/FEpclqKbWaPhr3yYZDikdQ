No real complaints.  I love walking into a bookstore with so many worlds and choices waiting to be explored.  I love going into Barnes & Noble if for no other reason to get an idea of what is out there.  I've primarily been an e-book reader for the last 4-5 years and I find the prices on the digital marketplace to be much more favorable to the consumer.  That being said, I do like being able to walk into a bookstore and peruse their library for new books and authors, something I find much easier to do in a bookstore than a digital marketplace.    I do occasionally purchase books from there as there are a number of authors that I prefer to own the hardcover version of their work rather than an e-book.  You can usually find great deals on a number of interesting titles in their clearance and sale section and they also have a great selection of books for younger children.  I love being able to walk in and grab a book and sit on one of their comfy chairs for a while and read a bit of the book to see if I will like it.  I've always found the staff to be friendly and knowledgeable, usually helping me find a book based off a (usually) vague description I give them!  Definitely stop in if you are looking for books, you can also save money in the long run if you purchase a lot of books by joining their rewards club.

It's a fun marijuana-themed sub shop with fantastic subs and great prices.  I would highly (get it?) recommend.

This location is the primary place I purchase my games.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and I will usually spend some time in there talking with them about upcoming games and speculation regarding the industry.  They ask if you are looking to reserve any upcoming titles because it's part of their job, but I never feel the pressure from them that I usually do from other locations.  The store is always clean when I go inside and they have a great selection of titles and merchandise.  The chain gets a lot of flak because of their trade in values, but ultimately they are a for-profit business and are usually running a promotion that will increase the amount of $ you see from your merchandise.

Honestly, one of the worst companies I have ever done business with.  If you have any other option available to you, GO WITH IT!  I signed up for a promotional deal tv/cable/phone that was 99.99 for 6 months.  I was even quoted 109.72 after taxes and fees.  My first bill I expected activation fees so I wasn't surprised by that, however, not ONCE did I receive a bill that was less than 135.00.  Their reps are incompetent when you call with a problem, you're consistently told one thing while the exact opposite occurs.  They are CRAZY expensive for what you get, I had gone from being a DIRECTV customer with 100's of channels in high definition for 34.99/month.  My Cox bill for TV was double that monthly for less than half of the channels offered by DIRECTV.  When I was a Qwest/Century Link customer I couldn't wait to get Cox high speed internet back.  Boy was I wrong, I would constantly have dropped connections, DNS errors and more.    They also advertise speeds "up to 25 megabytes per second and I consistently would check out around 12-14mbps on speedtest.net.  Now I understand I'm not always going to pull a 25Mbps connection all the time, but it's hard to stomach paying a 59.99/month bill for speeds i NEVER achieved.    Seriously, avoid this company like the plague if you can.  We went back to DIRECTV after moving into a house and I will NEVER do business with this company again if I can help it.  People let the contract of DIRECTV scare them away and I say this, don't let it,  my previous time with DIRECTV my bill was the same dollar amount every month without fail unless I ordered a PPV fight and every month with Cox it was a surprise as to what I would be billed even though my services never changed!

I had heard a good deal of positive things about this restaurant before I was able to get in there and try them.  I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the staff was friendly and efficient.  I've only eaten items off their breakfast menu but their plates were absolutely huge!  I was unable to finish my meal both times I've visited and they keep the coffee flowing which is always a plus.  I can't speak for other items on their menu but if you are looking for a great breakfast I would recommend skipping IHOP (located across the street) and stopping in at Black Bear Diner,  The food is great, they provide a child friendly atmosphere and the prices are low considering the amount of food you receive,  Definitely give them a chance if you are in the area,

Coffee was fairly good.  The good thing with Starbucks is no matter where you are, you have a good idea of what to expect.  It's not my favorite coffee in the world, but it does the trick and there are worse you can choose.    I usually grab their dark roast with a couple shots of french vanilla with enough room left for a bit of half & half with a couple packets of sugar.  If you get a chance grab one of their cinnamon crumb coffee cakes, good stuff!

One of my favorite burger joints in the valley.  The burgers are huge and are cooked to your desire which is a plus as a number of places won't cook medium rare.  The restaurant always has a friendly staff and they serve you quickly.  If there is just two of you dining, I would recommend sharing a basket of fries and they bring out quite a large amount.  Overall, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, is clean and moderately priced.  If you are in the area and are looking for a good burger I would recommend checking Islands out.  You won't be disappointed.  They also have a good strawberry lemonade drink I would recommend.

Overall, I would say they are probably my favorite pizza chain around.  Their pizza, breadsticks and wings are all good and their price is fair.  I consider them to be a much better option over something like Domino's or Pizza Hut, but my favorite pizza in the valley is still Brother's Pizza.  I would definitely recommend checking them out if you are in the mood for pizza.  They are my go-to choice for pizza night!

I find they offer solid Asian cuisine at a reasonable price.  I love the fact that I can place the order over the phone and then pick it up when it's ready.  I usually get the Chicken Lo Mein along with Lettuce Wraps or their Crab Wantons.  It's like a fast food version of PF Changs.  If you are in the mood for Chinese food, you could do significantly worse than stopping at Pei Wei.

This is a pretty good restaurant that focuses on burgers.  They have a great selection of appetizers and I would recommend getting their tower of onion rings.  Every one of the burgers I've tried from here has been good and I would recommend getting one topped with crispy onion straws.  I've also had their French Onion soup and that was very good as well.  It's a great place to bring the kids as they provide some coloring material and the walls and interior are very colorful providing a good distraction for kids to look around.  The noise level is also conducive to kids as you won't get a lot of strange looks if your child happens to get a little loud.  They also have a good selection of chicken sandwiches as well if you aren't in the mood for a burger.  Their steak fries are good and come in a bottomless bucket, with as many refills as you want.    If you are in the mood for a decent priced burger and looking for quick service I would recommend checking Red Robin out.  I've never had a bad experience with the restaurant.

It was not bad.  '50s style atmosphere with a friendly staff.  Their prices were comparable to other frozen yogurt shops but their selection and topping selection is smaller than that of Yogurt-ini.  I would more than likely return though.  Check them out if you're in the area.

I waited around for about 40 minutes before finally leaving. I've never seen such slow barbers before. In the 40 minutes I was there exactly one new customer was seated and the other three didn't look close to being done despite having been in the seat for at least 40 minutes. It was comical watching the heavily tatted barber take 40 minutes going over the same fade over and over and over. There's quicker and more efficient barbershops in the immediate area that I'll stick to and would recommend over this place.

I've been using XV products since August of last year.  I happened to luck out by finding him first as I've heard bad things about various e-cigs in the past.  When we arrived, he went through his spiel about how his vape juice was different and better than competitors (which is what you expect everyone to say).  The difference is it's true with him, since becoming a customer vaping has turned in to a full on passion of mine.  He constantly has the latest and best merchandise available on the market, his flavors are head and shoulders above the competition and Tom is a friendly and knowledgeable individual.  After a visit or two, it becomes readily apparent that this is a man and a company that truly care about their customers and won't sell them something that they aren't comfortable with or they won't like.  I've spent countless hours conversing with Tom and have witnessed countless customer transactions and can say he is a "zero-pressure" salesmen.    Both my wife and I quit smoking in large part thanks to Tom!  Never feel hesitant to ask questions if you have them as he definitely takes the time to make sure you know how the product works and how to maintain it after you've taken it home for use.  His flavor variety is second to none and while he has standard flavors like strawberry & cinnamon that you expect to find at all e-cig shops, he has numerous flavors unique to his shop.  People seeking a 'tobacco-like" vapor experience, try his XV1, it's hands down the best tobacco liquid I've tried. Coffee lovers MUST try both his Columbian coffee and Cafe Braziliano flavors. Other than that, go down to his shop or his kiosk located in the Goodyear SwapSmart and you can try any flavor he offers.

I lucked into finding Terry somehow and have used him on three separate occasions and each time I've walked away feeling like I took advantage of him and not the other way around.  He is honest to fault, and the whole family are just amazing, genuine, and caring people. As far as I'm concerned,  I won't ever take my vehicles anywhere else.

Very unethical and dishonest business.  When we called them they asked us what we were needing to be seen for.  We told them and came down there only to have them take our insurance information and tell us that they don't have the capability to see patients there for what we needed and then proceeded to have the audacity to request $219 in payment from us.  For telling us they wouldn't be able to help us.  When they easily could've informed us of that when we called them and told them we needed to be seen for.  We walked out of there without paying them a dime and I would avoid them at all costs and I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on them.  Completely unacceptable!
