Was here for 3 hours and there were only 2 people in front of me! Epic fail! They only have 1 doctor and 1 provider on the weekends so good luck getting URGENT care!

Third time I've been in due to a lack of breakfast places around and I have to say this place sucks. The women who work here seem to be the most miserable humans on earth. Owning a restaurant myself I pride myself on our customer service and positive demeanor. I actually got a judge mental noise (which I don't know how to convey through writing) when my husband said no toast.  She might as well have rolled her eyes!  Outside of the terrible customer service my husband and I ordered the meat omelettes. The outside was over cooked while the inside was undercooked, the bacon was limp and actually triggered my gag reflex and the potatoes have zero seasoning.  Previous to owning a restaurant I would probably have excused the behavior for having a bad day but not anymore. You want a business/job? You gotta work for it.

Went in at 9:15 right after they opened and couldn't believe how packed it was! I was sent here by a friend who loves this place and I see why.  I've had a hard time finding someone who does my nails the way I like but today I finally found my nail whisperer! Lol! Even though it was busy he got me in right away. Brian looked at all of my Pinterest pictures and was patient when I changed the color a few times too! He did my nails just the way I like them, thin stiletto and long. The gel Polish came out beautifully and the price was just right. I will be coming back to this nail shop for all of my nail needs. Can't wait to get a pedicure!

I have been with Sabrina for over a year and through two salons. The first salon was pretty low budget but she was the shining jewel in the place! We have done probably 6 different looks in 2012 and its ended in the best haircut and color I've ever had thanks to her suggestions! She moved to Salon de Cheveux and I think this is where she belongs. Everyone there is so nice, professional, the stations are clean and I leave happy. I love the fun and eclectic looks of each of the women working.  I highly recommend this salon and Sabrina if you are looking for a current, modern fun look to best compliment your style. Just can't say enough :)

Justin did my nails and did a great job! Not a talkative guy but I was very happy with the job he did.

Got my nails done by the owner a few months back. It was terrible. Although he was very nice he paid no attention to what he was doing and was doing a terrible job. I stopped him half way through and left. I post this now because I have finally found a great salon called Estrella Nails on Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant where they are nice and pay attention.

Just had lunch for the 2nd time and it was bad for the 2nd time. My husband was served the wrong meal and my Cali chicken was the consistency of a thick rubber yoga mat. Upon telling the waitress she just took it away and didn't apologize, ask if she could get me anything else, offer to replace it... Nothing. Will never go back for food there again.

Well stocked, clean but the floor staff wasn't very helpful or friendly. Only 1 out of Maybe 3 asked me if I needed help when I obviously did. The cashier was very nice and talkative but their registers were making all kinds of racket for some reason.

Was served dirty mushrooms and gotta hair in my fries! Disgusting! Will stick to drinking here unless they keep having crappy bands come play on the weekends.

If you are looking for bottom of the barrel skanks and fat, sweaty old men then this is the place to go! With the DJ tempting me in with top 40 country music we walked through a field of cigarette smoke to a packed bar. Upon first look it seemed like an amiable enough place. After waiting for 10 min for a male bartender to take notice I practically jumped up and down on the bar next to the men he just served only for him to turn around and take a mans order on the other side of the bar.  After I got my drink they played maybe 2 more country songs then all top 40 dance music ala Jason Derulo. Not what I signed up for. I'm all for that music but I'm IN A COUNTRY BAR!   The only redeeming qualities is they have good drinks, albeit I drink whiskey on rocks.. Not much to screw up. Also they had an MMA fight on so that bodes well with me.  I don't know where they missed the mark. The ambiance is nice. Clean and well maintained and stylish. I think the biggest strike against it is the DJ and their idea of attracting a crowd is by exploiting women having them do blow job shots on command. Seriously I'd like to think women are more evolved than that. You are not attracting women (especially those who spend real money in bars/clubs) with these kinds of antics. And anyone who knows anything about running a bar knows that women are your core demographic. Get the women to your bar and men will follow.  So I say shame on you Whiskey Rose, you seem better than this and I think with a change in management you could exceed the business you do now.  Let me know when you get you shit together Whiskey Rose and we will talk. Until then so fucking long.
