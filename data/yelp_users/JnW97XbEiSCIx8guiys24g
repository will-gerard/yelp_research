They don't honor the Yelp deal they have listed here.  I ordered a plate (bento) and wasn't offered my choice of sides even though they were listed on the menu, so make sure to ask for what you want as sides.  Ordered the chicken katsu and the teriyaki beef. The katsu tasted pretty good and the beef was alright.  Overall, the  food is aesthetically pleasing and tastes okay for the price but a bit of a let down, even if I disregard the false advertising.

Which Wich is my new on-the-go sandwich spot. Great value for a solid, customizable sandwich. And the owner is a friendly, enthusiastic guy whose cool glasses should be appreciated by all!

I always love a place where the employees look like they're having a good time, and Ike's had it! Rachel was the best - not only really enthusiastic and attentive, but also a lot of fun.  We got the Bear Hug and the Spiffy Tiffy . Both were fantastic and the dutch crumble bread tasted like a buttery biscuit. All the ingredients tasted fresh and high-quality, especially the pesto. Large portions, though, so we got a dinner out of it, too.  A little pricey, but definitely worth it, especially because we happened to get there during happy hour (4pm-7pm, I think) so we got a free drink and chips. They also give a caramel apple pop with the sandwich.  Can't wait for the new location opening soon on Mill Ave!
