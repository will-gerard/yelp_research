I have no idea how such a tiny place is able to churn out such an enormous amount of quality food.  The patio is large and eclectic with an array of mismatching tables, chairs, and lights. It's hard not to immediately feel at home here. Food has been exceptional on every visit, my favorite item being the fried green tomato sandwich. Cocktails have also been superb. It's a good bet that whatever you decide on will be both surprising and just what you were hoping for.  My husband and I had our wedding dinner at Welcome Diner and it was absolutely perfect. Before friends arrived I warned the staff that there was a sizable group coming by and if we were in the way or too loud to please let me know and I'd deal with it. The staff's response was, "That's just the vibe here. You're fine." They handled the crowd that night so well, and with such great and friendly energy.

A friend and I got Groupons for facials with Elina and had a wonderful experience. I opted for microdermabrasion and while the process is slightly uncomfortable everything before and after definitely made up for it. Elina gave each of us wonderful neck and shoulder massages and in the end we both left feeling like we'd been drugged (in a good way).

The ambiance feels like you're in a neglected highway rest stop. The tables are never clean. There's always a line. The food is messy, greasy, and served on styrofoam.   It's perfect.

This is the perfect place to finish up a night out. It's loud, it's cozy, it's cluttered. It's ideal for ordering one last plate of greasy fries as you sober up and prepare for a clumsy walk home. The service isn't always fast and the staff isn't always friendly, but overall the place is welcoming and easy to feel comfortable in.

Like other reviewers, I get carry-out from here at least once a month. The curries last for multiple meals and are fantastic. I'm also a sucker for the Thai iced teas.

The service is always terribly slow but the food is great and the happy hour prices on appetizers are irresistible. I want to bathe in the mediterranean bruschetta.

Went on a weekday afternoon over ASU's summer break and was treated to amazing service. The women working the front were incredibly warm and welcoming and made sure we were never in need of chips, salsa, or drinks.  Clare burro with green sauce was fantastic. Loved the whole beans and how messy and flavorful the whole dish was.

After settling for one or two vegetarian options on menus for years it's pretty overwhelming to select something from Udupi. Pages and pages of meat-free amazingness! My dinner companion and I ordered the palak paneer and dhal curries and both were SUPERB. I can't wait to go back and try more.

My only gripe about Essence is that it isn't open on Sundays, which somehow is always the only day I'm available to go. The croissants are incredible. They are perfect. The macarons are expensive but delicious enough that you'll almost always convince yourself you need one. Everything else is fairly well priced, and reasonably portioned. It tends to get awfully crowded in the mornings, though, and during the summers is fairly warm inside.

A group of us needed to find a last minute place to get breakfast and we randomly chose Butterfield's based on convenient location. We made a pretty good choice. The service was fast, efficient, friendly. The menu was extensive and well priced. One day, when I've given up on life, I plan to go back and order the oreo cookie pancakes.  They look amazing. They also look like they'll probably kill me.

The coffee is generally too hit-or-miss to draw me in, especially with Lola so close by. Both iced and hot beverages usually end up tasting watered down. Where Fair Trade excels is with their teas, snacks, and smoothies. It's also a dream for those who enjoy working from coffee shops. They kick Lola's ass in terms of table space, noise level, available outlets, and small affordable things to nibble on.  They also offer some pretty good Belly deals!

The salads and pizza at Market Bistro are maybe some of the best I've ever had in Phoenix. Four years of coming here and I still have yet to run across something that's disappointed me. Anytime the temperature dips below 70 I start craving some vegetarian corn chowder.  Off the topic of food, but still worth noting is how cool the bathroom mirror is. If you stand just right you can get a perfect white ring just around your pupils.  My only complaint is that the lunch rush can get crowded and loud. There is usually always seating available at the bar or on the patio, though. And the staff (at both locations) has always been accommodating and friendly.

The owner here will gladly, without fail, devote time to helping each customer decide what they're looking for. Because of this the line tends to get backed up. This is just about the only downside to the place, which is otherwise amazing and staffed with some of the friendliest people in Phoenix. I highly recommend stuffing yourself to the brim with falafel, taboule and tzatziki. DO NOT leave without trying the lemonade. It's bizarre, almost jarring at first, but it'll get you hooked.

The coffee here is superb. The atmosphere, staff, and clientele is the worst. I loathe having to spend any amount of time longer than it takes to order and pay in the place, even with the new renovations (which have made it a slightly more enjoyable place, I will admit). If given the choice I will usually pick a less stuffy and unapproachably hip place. But even with all of my gripes the coffee alone still warrants a solid 4 stars.

Womp womp.  Pros: the cocktails really are great, and if you're there on a less-than-busy night the bartenders are very helpful and attentive.  Cons: the man who seats patrons and takes reservations is made of ice. I've had  run ins with him before, but the most recent visit has convinced me to stop trying. He was very short with our party of two, as well as the other small parties before and after us. Once we were seated no one stopped by for over 15 minutes. For anything. Not water, not "I'll be right with you", nothing. It was as if we weren't there at all. It was a decent night for them, about half full. On our side (bar) there were two other people sitting at the bench by the window. At one point, two men walked through the bar and attempted to enter the restaurant in order to pass along a message to some friends eating dinner when they were stopped by the host and asked to leave as "this is a very small establishment and there is no room for you". The men handled it well, joking after the server walked away that apparently the place was "at critical mass". My companion and I waited a few more minutes, trying to appear as hungry and thirsty as possible, and then eventually gave up and walked out.  I recommend walking around the corner to Pomo.

PROS: * The location cannot be beat. The place sits between a gorgeous little park and the edge of the arts district. Everywhere you look there's incredible food and interesting events just a short walk away.  * The neighbors. Being in the Downtown Bubble means you'll run into the same people over and over again, as well as their pets. For the most part, everyone living at Roosevelt Square is fairly young, active, and friendly.  CONS: Everything else * The property is poorly maintained, despite first glances. The entry gates are constantly broken - either permanently locked with a malfunctioning fob detector, or permanently wide open. The parking garage gates are the same story. Several times I found myself either locked in or out, with no clue how to get through. I advise you to get to know your neighbors so you can call them in these situations and have them let you in. This will happen a lot. * Management is AWFUL. Every day you will receive a poorly spelled, poorly written update on some kind of emergency event (water shut off, gates not working, fire doors malfunctioning). * Maintenance is a toss up. The staff themselves are great and very knowledgeable and friendly. But it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days for them to show up. I had a malfunctioning smoke alarm attached to a vaulted ceiling going off for 5 days before management sent someone. This was after sending multiple service requests and pleading with office staff to take it seriously. Maintenance staff will also show up unannounced, so beware of wearing headphones or taking showers during the day because more than once I was surprised when I found a stranger hunched over in my living room. * From 2014-2016 our water was shut off 45 times for "emergency repairs" (see image). In February of 2016 alone it was shut off 7 times. * Bike theft is rampant. If you have a bike, do not leave it locked up in the stairwells. * Although the parking garages have security cameras at the entrances, they are non-functioning. I discovered this after my husband's car was backed in to and we asked if we could review the footage. There was no footage. * There are two enormous dumpsters in Building C's garage labeled RECYCLE and CARDBOARD ONLY. Turns out they are neither and everything in them is picked up by the regular garbage collector. The only true recycle container is in Building A's garage. * The first floor hallways are prone to flooding (see image) and are rarely, if ever, cleaned. This place is very pet friendly, but many of the animals seem to have trouble holding it and are known to relieve themselves inside. Poop is only cleaned up if enough of the residents begin to make a fuss over it, and often times other residents give in and take care of it because they're just sick of seeing it every day. Urine is never washed away, so beware the discolored areas.

Great portion sizes for the money. Every dish has been fantastic, though I am especially fond of the coconut soup. The restaurant is always quiet, clean, and the staff is always very welcoming.

I recommend Lola over any other coffee in Downtown Phoenix.   They consistently do everything better, faster, and cheaper than the competition. The coffee is strong, reasonably priced, and there's a decent menu variety. I live nearby and have had to limit myself to 2 visits per week or my budget app starts chastising me with notifications reminding me how weak I am for a good latte and scone.  Treat yourself: Try the whipped cream at least once. It's incredible.

The drip coffee and cold brew are more on the acidic side and the general attitude is a little unfriendly, but their chai latte is far and away the best in the valley.

Like all new restaurants, this place could stand to have a little more insulation to keep the volume levels below deafening on busier nights. I've come to avoid Angels Trumpet on the weekends just because I know how unbearably loud it's going to be inside. Thankfully, the patio is enormous, well shaded, and nicely laid out. So if there's availability you can find solace outside.  The beer selection is, of course, unbeatable. There's something new every day, so you better not fall head over heels for a certain brew because it won't be there for long. The service has always been impeccable and I've come to really trust each server's recommendations.

Found this place using the "nearby" feature on the Yelp app and decided to give it a try. The menu is small but varied, the price is awesome ($4.50-$4.75), and the product is delicious. I got a vegetarian breakfast sandwich (#33: two poached eggs, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh spinach) and my boyfriend got the Nutella, peanut butter, banana, almond sandwich. We both happily demolished them immeditately. Both Carol, the owner, and the young guy working the register were pleasant and conversational. Carol seemed to make fast friends with every customer who walked in, making sure to check on them and ask their names. One unusual thing about Zookz is the addition of a small sink at the beverage counter. This is so useful for dumping out leftover ice and liquids and rinsing plastic containers before you place them in the recycle bin next to it.   Oh, and they have punch cards! 10th sandwich is free! We will definitely be trying this place again.

I proudly demolished almost an entire margherita pizza from Federal the other night and don't regret a single bite. Decent beer selection, great service, crowded but pleasant atmosphere, and a creative pizza menu.   On Mondays and Tuesdays Federal offers a pizza, 2 pitchers of beer or 1 carafe of wine for $20.

* There will be a wait. * It will be crowded. * It will be loud. * The food will be worth it.  I came here on my birthday. On my wedding day. On the first day of the year. Whenever I have a friend in town. Whenever I wake up early. Whenever I'm hungover. Whenever anyone mentions breakfast... There's just never a wrong time to eat the most perfect waffle ever created.

Pomo is a hugely welcome addition to the downtown area and manages to hold its own against the nearby Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco. Great wine selection, decent beer choices, and the food is terrificl. An additional perk are the complimentary powdered sugar dough crisps and limoncello shot.

I live down the street and dine in/pick up about once a week. The menu is great, with lots of flavor and price variety. No matter my mood I can always find something that sounds good. There's happy hour 7 days a week and a great selection of beer and wine.  Pizza People Pub now creates "nearly zero waste", having adopted a composting system for any food waste, and switching from a dumpster to a Republic Services recycling bin. I love when a business shows willingness to adapt and hope that they influence other restaurants in the area.  Even on their busier nights the service is always fantastic. Specific kudos to Drew, Nick and owner MaryBeth for always remembering us and coming over to say hi.

CONS: - Surprisingly few vegetarian options. - Pricey.  PROS: - Great patio area. - Pricey for good reason: everything was incredibly fresh, flavorful, and the portion sizes were very generous.

This is an awesome little place with a great vibe in a neighborhood that I love to see doing well... but the pizza doesn't cut it. We got an 18" pie with sausage and pepperoni on half, basil and mushrooms on the other, and also used the Yelp check-in deal to claim a free veggie slice. Nothing was great. The crust tasted slightly sweet and didn't quite seem to jive with any of the toppings.

Awesome to visit a place that doesn't just slap a wet roasted red pepper between to slices of bread and call it a day on their vegetarian menu development. Veg and vegan options are all superb and surprisingly filling.

Delivers exactly what it advertises: quick, cheap, quality pizza with a Chipotle-style assembly. With so many other decent pizza options in the Downtown area, Fired Pie surprisingly holds its own.

This building is known for its poor luck with businesses staying open, but it's looking like Paz will stand a chance.  I was lured over by the $3 margarita and looking to wind down after seeing a movie at Film Bar. The margarita was excellent! Definitely worth the $3 and then some. My husband and I split the nachos and were unable to make much of a dent in them though not for lack of trying. I recommend sharing among 3 or 4 people. The place was PACKED so service was on the slower side. Still, our wonderful waiter was sure to stop by and update us on wait times for our food and drinks.  On the night we went there was a great DJ and a small dance floor. While we weren't able to hold much of a conversation with the noise level that high, watching the couples dance was a lot of fun.

The building is beautiful.   Great high ceilings, plenty of place to sit with a group or spend the day working. The First Friday marketplace is great, as well as the indoor farmers market. Everything else, however, is lacking. The bar service is incredibly slow and more than once I've given up and gone home because I couldn't even get staff to acknowledge that I was there. The food is fine if not bland, definitely not worth the price, especially because everything is served to-go and you do all bussing yourself.

I noticed on Facebook one afternoon that The Coronado just recently opened and went that same night to see what it was all about. A friend of mine described it as "a mix between Lux and Braggs" (RIP), something I definitely agree with after visiting.  The bar is also the counter you order food from, and is covered in fresh pastries in little glass cases. They had plenty of cookies, tarts, pies, and even a pineapple cake. Water, napkins, and silverware are all self-serve. Seating is also DIY, and while it's limited inside the tiny rooms, there's a huge patio on the side and even a few tables in the front.   My husband and I are obnoxiously small eaters, so we split the jackfruit siders and fries. I nearly licked the plate clean! Flavor and texture was awesome. Spicy mayo was perfect. Between the two of us, it was the ideal amount of food. Even with a full stomach, though, I couldn't help eyeing the Monte Vista Torta ordered by the table next to us. It was gorgeous, and something I will definitely be trying on my next visit.
