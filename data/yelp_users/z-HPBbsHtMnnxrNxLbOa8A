There are really too many things that are wonderful about this business to mention in a short review.  Howard and Pat are just stand-up great people who run a great business.  I would not take my vehicle anywhere else in town.  The things you should know: They are honest, efficient, take great care of their customers and most of all they serve their community.  Yesterday I took my vehicle in for a small repair and Jason and Jesus at the MetroCenter location of course took great care of me and my vehicle.  I have been coming here for years and I have never had a negative experience.  Thank you Community Tire for being my go to car/tire repair place.

The food is good, not excellent.  Stay away feom getting your food delivered, you will wait 1.5 hours and every time they will forget at least half your order. If the kitchen is this understaffed,  hire more people. I will NEVER order from here again because the last 3 times the service was late, they forgot half the order and its just not worth it.
